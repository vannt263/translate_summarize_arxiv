    "a dc current can be generated in a mesoscopic circuit connected to two electrodes even in the absence of a bias voltage if a set of external parameters , e.g. gate voltages , are changed periodically in time  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is known as charge pumping .",
    "if the external parameters are changed slowly as compared to the typical time scales of the system the pumping is adiabatic . in this case",
    "the charge pumped after one cycle does not depend on the detailed timing of the cycle , but only on its geometrical properties .",
    "charge pumping can be realized in a variety of different situations . in systems consisting of mesoscopic phase - coherent conductors",
    "parametric pumping can be achieved through a periodic modulation of the phases of the scattering matrix .",
    "this regime has been studied extensively both for metallic conductors , see e.g. refs .   and hybrid systems  @xcite containing superconducting terminals . in the opposite regime of systems consisting of quantum dots connected through tunnel junctions , charge pumping is achieved by the periodic modulation of the coulomb blockade  @xcite . in this case phase coherence",
    "is irrelevant and the number of electrons transfered per cycle is approximately quantized : the generated current @xmath2 is related to the frequency of cycle @xmath3 via @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of electrons transfered in each cycle and @xmath6 is the electron charge .",
    "experimental evidence for parametric charge pumping in normal metallic systems has been demonstrated for the first time in refs .  .",
    "the situation is radically different if superconducting islands are considered .",
    "here at low temperatures pumping is due to the transport of cooper pairs  @xcite .",
    "a cooper pair pump can be realized by an array of josephson junctions connected to two superconducting reservoirs , kept at a fixed phase bias @xmath7  @xcite . in this case , even in those situations where pumping is associated to a periodic modulation of the coulomb blockade , superconducting phase coherence is fundamental  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in addition to the dependence of the pumped charge on the characteristics of the cycle , in superconducting pumps there is a dependence on the superconducting phase difference between the reservoirs .",
    "the geometric nature of the pumped charge has been analyzed both in the abelian  @xcite and non - abelian  @xcite cases thus opening the possibility to experimentally detect geometric phases in superconducting nanocircuits  @xcite .",
    "indeed an experimental detection of the berry phase by means of cooper pair pumping has recently been reported  @xcite .     and @xmath8 are the capacitances and josephson energies of the junctions . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are gate capacitances and voltages , @xmath7 is the overall phase difference . by a proper modulation of the gate",
    "voltages a given charge is moved from , say , the left to the right electrode . in general the pumped charge will depend on the modulation shape and on the phase difference @xmath7 . in the protocol considered here",
    "the dependence on @xmath7 is absent .",
    "[ fig : pump ] ]    in addition to the importance of addressing fundamental questions related to the quantum mechanical behavior of macroscopic systems , accurate charge pumping can be used for metrological purposes . in the case of single - electron pumps the transfered charge , at frequency @xmath3 of a few mhz ,",
    "has reached such an accuracy ( uncertainty of @xmath11 ) to make a new metrological standard of capacitance possible  @xcite . by pumping a certain number of electrons onto a capacitor , and measuring the resulting voltage , one can measure capacities of the order of 1pf . on the contrary , the frequencies , and consequently the current intensities , in single - electron pumps",
    "has not been sufficiently high for setting a standard of current .",
    "a superconducting cooper pair pump , in principle , would allow for higher frequencies although several effects such as landau - zener tunneling , supercurrent leakage through the pump , and coherent corrections ( which are of crucial importance to reveal geometric phases ) would lead to all sorts of inaccuracies in cooper pair pumping .",
    "some works have been done to achieve more accurate pumping in adiabatic regime by optimizing the design of the pump  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow a different approach .",
    "we will design very accurate cooper pair pumps by optimizing the pulse shapes of the gate voltages during the cycle .",
    "most importantly we are not bound to work in the adiabatic limit therefore increasing , at the same time , both the accuracy and the frequency of operation .",
    "the theoretical framework which will apply to achieve this goal is that of optimal control theory  @xcite .",
    "this approach was successfully applied to superconducting qubits to improve one- and two - qubit gates  @xcite and it was shown that it can help in reducing the error in the gate operation by several order of magnitudes . as we will describe in the rest of the paper ,",
    "optimal control is also helpful in the case of cooper pair pumping where , for the case we consider , the error is reduced up to five orders of magnitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will describe the model for the cooper pair pump used in the rest of the paper .",
    "we will then give ( sec .",
    "[ oqc ] ) a brief introduction to the optimal control algorithm employed in this work . in sec .",
    "[ res ] we present the results obtained for our non adiabatic optimal pump . after having",
    "discussed the achieved accuracy ( sec .",
    "[ optimal ] ) we analyze in details the effect of possible imperfections in the pulse shapes ( sec .  [ shapes ] ) , the effect of noise ( sec .  [ noise ] ) , as well as the effect of unavoidable variations in charging and josephson energy from junction to junction ( sec .",
    "[ parameters ] ) , in order to test the robustness of the pump .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusions and to a comparison with other proposals to realize accurate pumps .",
    "the three - junction cooper pair pump considered in the paper is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pump ] .",
    "it consists of an array of three josephson junctions with two gated islands ; @xmath8 and @xmath12 are , respectively , josephson energy and capacity of @xmath13th junction , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , gate capacitance and gate voltage applied on the @xmath13th island .",
    "the number of extra cooper pairs on the @xmath13th island is denoted with @xmath14 and @xmath7 is the overall phase difference between the two superconducting electrodes . in the case of a uniform array , which we consider here ,",

    "tunneling of one cooper pair through the @xmath20th junction changes the number of pairs on @xmath20th and @xmath21th island , so that the only non - zero components of @xmath22 are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "moreover the forward ( backward ) tunneling of one pair through each junction is related to a @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) phase difference .",
    "the pump operates in the charging limit , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "each hexagon corresponds to a given charge ( eigen)state ( for @xmath28 ) of the system @xmath29 . in the adiabatic regime charge",
    "is pumped when the gate charges are varied along , for example , the circular path with radius @xmath30 centered at the degeneracy point ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "[ fig : stability ] ]    as discussed in ref .",
    "the cooper pair pump is operated by changing periodically in time the two gate charges @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is useful to first analyze the case in which the pump is driven adiabatically . in this case",
    "the time dependence of the gate charge is not important , what matters is the path which is followed in the parameter space . as was discussed extensively in the past ( see e.g. ref .  )",
    "it is important that the cycle encloses the triple point degeneracy ( @xmath31 ) in the stability diagram as described in fig.[fig : stability ] .",
    "the various regions in fig.[fig : stability ] indicate the corresponding ground state of the charging part of the hamiltonian . after a cycle , for example",
    "the one indicated in the figure , the state of the pump goes back to its initial situation but ( approximately ) one cooper pair has been transferred through the system . as it has been discussed in  @xcite , this pump does not lead to a sufficient quantization accuracy : the error scales as @xmath34 . a smaller error",
    "can be achieved either by increasing the number of junctions or by pumping by means of gate voltage and flux modulation as in the cooper pair sluice  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we take a different approach to optimize the pump .",
    "our proposed device operates in the non - adiabatic limit , in which the time dependence of the pulses is important . in order to have an accurate pump",
    "we will then optimize the pulse shapes by means of quantum optimal control ( see next section ) .",
    "these ingredients allow to construct a _ fast _ and _ accurate _",
    "cooper pair pump .    as we will show in the next section , in order to use the quantum optimal control",
    ", one needs to have a desired final state differing from the initial state and at least one parameter as a control in the hamiltonian of the system . since in pumping",
    "the initial and final states of the system are the same apart from a phase we introduce a new quantum number , the counter @xmath35 .",
    "this counter is a passive detector which clicks each time a cooper pair goes through the junction where the counter is set . in the following",
    "we assume that the counter is placed in the last junction of the array , therefore if one pair passes this junction from left ( right ) to right ( left ) the counter will change by 1 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the counter considered is merely a fictitious element which we use to compute the pumped charge .",
    "no back action can be expected since we are not describing a physical detector .",
    "if one denotes the state of the array by @xmath37 and the state of the counter by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , the state of the system will be @xmath40 . in the hilbert space of charge states plus",
    "the counter index the hamiltonian of a three - junction uniform pump has the following form :    @xmath41           | \\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{n},m \\rangle \\langle \\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{n},m | \\nonumber\\\\           & - & \\frac{1}{2 } e_{j } \\sum_{m,\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{n } } \\left[e^{i\\frac{\\varphi}{3 } }           \\left(\\left|n_{1}+1 , n_{2 } , m\\right\\rangle          + \\left|n_{1}-1 , n_{2}+1 , m\\right\\rangle + \\left|n_{1 } , n_{2}-1 , m+1\\right\\rangle \\right )          \\left\\langle n_{1 } , n_{2 } , m\\right| + h.c . \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as it is clear in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h3 m ] ) , one can change the state of the counter without changing the energy so that all states @xmath40 with different values of @xmath42 are degenerate .",
    "quantum optimal control algorithms  @xcite are designed to lead a quantum system with state @xmath43 from an initial state @xmath44 to a target final state @xmath45 at time @xmath46 with a good fidelity @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "the algorithm employed in this work is called _ immediate feedback control _ and is guaranteed to give a fidelity improvement at each iteration  @xcite .",
    "the procedure is as follows : assume that @xmath49 is the set of control parameters which the hamiltonian depends on .",
    "first the state of the system @xmath43 is evolved in time with the initial condition @xmath44 and an initial guess @xmath50 for control parameters , giving rise to @xmath51 after time @xmath46 . at this point",
    "an iterative algorithm starts , aiming at improving the fidelity by adding a correction to control parameters in each step . in the @xmath5th step of this iterative algorithm",
    "* the auxiliary state @xmath52 is evolved backwards in time reaching @xmath53 .",

    "these two steps are repeated until the desired value of fidelity is obtained .    in this work",
    "we will use the described quantum optimal control algorithm to drive the system from the initial state @xmath60 to the final state @xmath61 , using the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h3 m ] ) for the time evolution where @xmath62 is the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h3 ] ) at time @xmath63 .",
    "the initial state @xmath64 can be achieved by suddenly coupling the array to the electrodes .",
    "the normalized gate charges @xmath65 and @xmath66 will be the control parameters . in all of the numerical simulations we performed we assume @xmath67 so that supercurrent is zero .",
    "moreover , in the adiabatic case and @xmath67 the errors are most severe , so that our settings describe the worst case scenario to test optimal control theory .",
    "the expectation value of the counter operator @xmath68 represents the pumped charge @xmath69 in unit of @xmath70 . an important measure of the accuracy of the pump is given by the deviation of the pumped charge from the quantized value @xmath71 in addition , since cooper pair pumping is a coherent process , it is also interesting to test the accuracy of the optimization protocol by measuring the departure of the final quantum state from the desired one . to this end",
    "we also study the fidelity at the end of time evolution @xmath72 which measures the overlap between the final state of the array and the ground state @xmath62 . in all plots",
    "we show the infidelity defined as @xmath73 .",
    "in this section we present our results for the non - adiabatic optimal pump with @xmath67 , i. e. when there is no supercurrent .",
    "the goal is to achieve a pumped charge as close as possible to @xmath70 ( we remind that @xmath67 is the case where the error is maximal without optimization ) .      motivated by the adiabatic case , as initial guess for control parameters",

    "<S> in adiabatic cooper pair pumps , operated by means of gate voltage modulation only , the quantization of the pumped charge during a cycle is limited due to the quantum coherence of the macroscopic superconducting wave function . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to obtain very accurate pumps in the non - adiabatic regime by a suitable choice of the shape of the gate voltage pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the shape of these pulses by applying quantum optimal control theory to this problem . in the optimal case </S>",
    "<S> the error , with respect to the quantized value , can be as small as of the order of @xmath0 : the error is reduced by up to five orders of magnitude with respect to the adiabatic pumping . in order to test the experimental feasibility of this approach we consider the effect of charge noise and the deformations of the optimal pulse shapes on the accuracy of the pump . </S>",
    "<S> charge noise is assumed to be induced by random background charges in the substrate , responsible for the observed @xmath1 noise . </S>",
    "<S> inaccuracies in the pulse shaping are described by assuming a finite bandwidth for the pulse generator . in realistic cases </S>",
    "<S> the error increases at most of one order of magnitude as compared to the optimal case . </S>",
    "<S> our results are promising for the realization of accurate and fast superconducting pumps . </S>"
