    "with motivation to model and analyze the transport of positive and negative charges in solar cells , an interacting random walk model in domains has recently been introduced in @xcite . in that model , a bounded domain in @xmath1 is divided into two adjacent sub - domains @xmath2 and @xmath3 by an interface @xmath0 .",
    "the subdomains @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the hybrid medias which confine the positive and the negative charges , respectively . at microscopic level ,",
    "positive and negative charges are modeled by independent continuous time random walks on lattices inside @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these two types of particles annihilate each other at a certain rate when they come close to each other near the interface @xmath0 .",
    "this interaction models the annihilation , trapping , recombination and separation phenomena of the charges . such a stochastic system can also model population dynamics of two segregated species under competition near their boarder",
    "under an appropriate scaling of the lattice size , the speed of the random walks and the annihilation rate , we proved in @xcite that the hydrodynamic limit is described by a system of nonlinear heat equations that are coupled on the interface and satisfy neumann boundary condition at the remaining part of the boundary .    while the random walk model in @xcite is more amenable to computer simulation , it is subject to technical restrictions associated with the discrete approximations of both the diffusions performed by the particles and the underlying domains @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , that model does not consider harvest of charges .    in this paper ,",
    "a new continuous state stochastic model is introduced and investigated .",
    "this model is different from that of @xcite in three ways : the particles perform reflected diffusions on continuous state spaces rather than random walks over discrete state spaces , particles are absorbed ( harvested ) at some regions ( harvest sites ) away from the interface @xmath0 , and the annihilation mechanism near @xmath0 is different .",
    "the model in this paper allows more flexibility in modeling the underlying spatial motions performed by the particles and in the study of their various properties .",
    "in particular , it is more convenient to work with when we study the fluctuation limit ( or , functional central limit theorem ) of the interacting diffusion system , which is the subject of an on - going project @xcite .",
    "here is a heuristic description of our new model ( see figure [ fig : model3 ] ) :    [ fig : model3 ]     interface , @xmath5 harvest sites ]    let @xmath4 and @xmath0 be as above .",
    "there is a harvest region @xmath6 that absorbs ( harvests ) @xmath7 charges , respectively , whenever it is being visited .",
    "let @xmath8 be the ( common ) initial number of particles in each of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume here that each particle in @xmath4 performs a brownian motion with drift in the interior of @xmath4 .",
    "these random motions model the transport of positive ( respectively , negative ) charges under an electric potential .",
    "when a particle hits the boundary , it is absorbed ( harvested ) on @xmath11 , and is instantaneously reflected on @xmath12 along the inward normal direction of @xmath4 . in other words , we assume that each particle in @xmath4 performs a reflected brownian motions ( rbm ) with drift in @xmath4 that is killed upon hitting @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , a pair of particles of opposite signs has a chance of being annihilated with each other when they are near @xmath0 . actually , when two particles of different types come within a small distance @xmath13 ( which must occur near the interface @xmath0 ) , they disappear with intensity @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is a given parameter modeling the rate of annihilation .",
    "the choice of the scaling @xmath14 for the per - pair annihilation intensity is to guarantee that , in the limit @xmath16 , a non trivial proportion of particles is killed during the time interval @xmath17 $ ] . here is the heuristic reasoning .",
    "since diffusive particles typically spread out in space , the number of pairs near the interface is of order @xmath18 ( because there are @xmath19 number of particles in @xmath2 near @xmath0 , and each of them is near to @xmath20 number of particles in @xmath3 ) . with the above choice of per - pair annihilation intensity , the expected number of pairs killed within @xmath21 units of time is about @xmath22 when @xmath23 is small",
    "this implies that a non trivial proportion of particle is annihilated during @xmath17 $ ] and accounts for the boundary term in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "we consider the normalized empirical measures @xmath24 here @xmath25 stands for the dirac measure concentrated at the point @xmath26 , while @xmath27 ( resp .",
    "@xmath28 ) denotes the condition that particle @xmath29 ( resp .",
    "@xmath30 ) is alive at time @xmath21 .",
    "our main result ( theorem [ t : conjecture_delta_n ] ) implies the following : suppose each particle in @xmath4 is a rbm with gradient drift @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a strictly positive function on @xmath33 .",
    "suppose @xmath13 tends to zero and @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath35 converges in distribution , then the random measures @xmath36 converge in distribution to a deterministic limit @xmath37 for any @xmath23 , where @xmath38 is the unique solution of the coupled heat equations @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the inward unit normal vector field on @xmath42 of @xmath4 and @xmath43 is the indicator function on @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath44 corresponds to the particular case when there is no drift .",
    "generalizations and applications : actually , theorem [ t : conjecture_delta_n ] is general enough to deal with any general symmetric reflected diffusions and covers the case when the constant @xmath45 is replaced by any continuous function @xmath46 on @xmath0 .",
    "it is routine to generalize to any continuous time - dependent function @xmath47 and the details are left to the readers .",
    "moreover , it is likely that a further generalization to tackle multiple deletion of particles near the interface ( similar to that in @xcite ) can be done in an analogous way . as an immediate application of theorem [ t : conjecture_delta_n ]",
    ", we obtain an analytic formula for the asymptotic mass of positive charges harvested during the time interval @xmath48 $ ] , which is @xmath49    [ rk : assumptiondeltan]the condition @xmath34 $ ] is an upper bound for the rate at which the annihilations distance @xmath13 tends to 0 .",
    "such kind of condition is necessary by the following reason : the dimension of @xmath0 is @xmath50 lower than that of @xmath51 .",
    "so we can choose @xmath13 small enough so that particles of different types can not ` see ' each other in the limit @xmath16 , resulting a decoupled linear system of pdes with dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath11 and neumann boundary condition on @xmath52 .",
    "see example [ countereg_1 ] for a rigorous statement and proof .",
    "theorem 3.2.39 of @xcite from geometric theory asserts that @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the volume of the unit ball in @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the @xmath58-dimensional hausdorff measure . in lemma",

    "leads us to the following key observation that @xmath62 this interchange of limit in turn allows us to characterize the mean of any subsequential limit of @xmath63 by comparing the integral equations satisfied by the hydrodynamic limit with its stochastic counterpart .",
    "using a similar argument , we can identify the second moment of any subsequential limit , and hence characterize any subsequential limit of @xmath63 .",
    "we point out here that @xmath64 quantifies the amount of interaction among the two types of particles , and is related ( but different from ) the _ collision local time _ introduced in @xcite . the direct approach developed in this paper to establish the hydrodynamic limit avoids going through the delicate bbgky hierarchy as was done in @xcite .",
    "interacting diffusion systems have been studied by many authors and they continue to be the subject of active research .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for such a system on a circle whose hydrodynamic limit is established using the entropy method .",
    "we also mention @xcite for a recent large deviation result for a system of diffusions in @xmath65 interacting through their ranks .",
    "this large deviation principle implies convergence of the system to the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "however , the methods in these papers do not seem to work ( at least not in a direct way ) for our annihilating diffusion model due to the singular interaction on the interface .",
    "an extensively studied class of stochastic particle systems is _ reaction - diffusion systems _",
    "( r - d systems in short ) , whose hydrodynamic limits are described by r - d equations @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a function in @xmath68 which represents the reaction .",
    "r - d systems is an important class of interacting particle systems arising from various contexts .",
    "they were investigated by many authors in both the discrete setting ( particles perform random walks ) and the continuous setting ( particles perform continuous diffusions ) .",
    "for instance , for the case @xmath67 is a polynomial in @xmath68 , these systems were studied in @xcite on a cube with neumann boundary conditions , and in @xcite on a periodic lattice .",
    "see also @xcite for a survey of a class of discrete ( lattice ) models called the _ polynomial model _ which contains the _",
    "schlgl s model_. recently , perturbations of the voter models which contain the _ lotka - volterra systems _ are considered in @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that the hydrodynamic limits are r - d equations and established general conditions for the existence of non - trivial stationary measures and for extinction of the particles .",
    "another stochastic particle systems which are related to our annihilation - diffusion model is the _ fleming - viot _ type systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite , burdzy and quastel studied an annihilating - branching system of two families of random walks on a domain . in their model ,",
    "when a pair of particles of different types meet , they annihilate each other and they are immediately reborn at a site chosen randomly from the remaining particles of the same type .",
    "so the total number of particles of each type remains constant over the time , and thus this fleming - viot type system is different from the annihilating random walk model of @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic limit of the model in @xcite is described by a linear heat equation with zero average temperature . an elegant result obtained by p.",
    "dittrich @xcite is on a system of reflected brownian motion on the unit interval @xmath69 $ ] with multiple deletion of particles .",
    "more precisely , any @xmath70-tuples ( @xmath71 ) of particles with distances between them of order @xmath72 , say @xmath73 , disappear with intensity @xmath74}p(\\eps^2,x^{i_1},y)\\cdots p(\\eps^2,x^{i_k},y)\\,dy$ ] , where @xmath75 are constants and @xmath76 is the transition density of the reflected brownian motion on @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "the hydrodynamic limit is a r - d equation with reaction term @xmath77 and neumann boundary condition .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , our model has two types of particles instead of one .",
    "moreover , the interaction of our model is singular near the boundary and gives rise to a boundary integral term in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "preliminary materials on setup , reflecting diffusions , and notations are given in section [ s:2 ] .",
    "a rigorous description of the interacting stochastic particle system we are going to study in this paper is presented in section [ s:3 ] . in section [ s:4 ] ,",
