    "the research of citation networks has drawn increasing attention and been applied to many fields@xcite .",
    "it can help scientists find useful academic papers@xcite , help inventors find interesting patents@xcite , or help judges discover relevant past judgements@xcite .",
    "the scientific citation networks considered in this paper are directed graphs , in which nodes represent papers , while edges stand for the citation relationships between them .",
    "since new papers can only cite the published papers@xcite , these graphs are acyclic .",
    "degree distribution is a fundamental research object of citation networks , and a series of models have been proposed to illustrate it .",
    "the price model appears to be the first to discuss about cumulative advantage in the context of citation networks and their in - degree distributions@xcite .",
    "the idea lies in that the rate at which a paper gets new citations should be proportional to the citations that it already has@xcite .",
    "this can lead to a power - law distribution according to the price model@xcite .",
    "a copy mechanism in which a new node attaches to a randomly selected target node as well as all its ancestors has been proposed by krapivsky et al@xcite . based on their viewpoints ,",
    "an author may be familiar with a few primary references and may simply copy the secondary references from the primary ones .",
    "this rule also leads to a power - law distribution .",
    "in addition , the cumulative advantage is also known as the preferential attachment in other literatures@xcite .",
    "jeong et al@xcite have measured the rate at which nodes acquire links on four kinds of real networks , and found that it depends on the node s degree .",
    "their results offer direct quantitative support for the presence of preferential attachment .",
    "moreover , an investigation has been conducted by eom et al@xcite on the microscopic mechanism for the evolution of citation networks by raising a linear preferential attachment with time - dependent initial attractiveness .",
    "the model reproduces the tails of the in - degree distributions of citation networks and the phenomenon called  burst \" : the citations received by papers increase rapidly in the early years since publication .",
    "the above - mentioned models have studied the tail of the in - degree distribution only , while the two - mechanism model proposed by george et al@xcite characterizes the properties of the overall in - degree distributions .",
    "with respect to the research of networks from the real world ( e.g. citation networks ) , using random geometric graph has become a hot topic in recent years .",
    "xie et al@xcitedefine the academic influence scope as a geometric area and present an influence mechanism , which means that an existing paper will be cited by a new paper located in its influence zone .",
    "based on this mechanism , they further propose the concentric circles model ( cc model ) , which can fit the power - law tails of the in - degree distributions of the citation networks with the exponentially growing nodes .",
    "nevertheless , the forepart of the in - degree distribution and the out - degree distribution can not be well fitted by this model . in reality , node - increment in many current citation networks enjoys a linear growth , e.g. cit - hepph , cit - hepth@xcite ( fig  [ fig1 ] ) and pnas including articles published during 2000 - 2015 ( shown in our later study ) .",
    "therefore , a model with linearly growing node - increment is proposed .",
    "the edges in the model are still linked according to the influence mechanism , whereas they are revised in that the influence scopes of papers are determined by their topics and ages ( the time that has passed since publication ) .",
    "different from the previous models that only focus on the tails of in - degree distributions , the improved model can well predict the overall in - degree distributions of the empirical data well . in consideration of the citations among different disciplines in real citation networks , a mechanism that is referred to as the interdisciplinary citation mechanism is proposed . under appropriate parameters",
    ", these mechanisms can reproduce a range of properties of citation networks , including the power - law tail of the out - degree distribution , giant component and clear community structure .",
    "meanwhile , some other properties can also be obtained like the relationship between in - degree and local clustering coefficient as well as in- and out - assortativity .",
    "these results show that our model can be used as a medium to study the intrinsic mechanism of citation networks .",

    "xie et al@xcite pay attention to the citation networks in which the annual numbers of papers grows exponentially , such as the citation network collected by tang et al@xcite for papers ( which are published in the period from 1936 - 01 - 01 to 2013 - 09 - 29 ) in dblp dataset .",

    "the edges in the model are linked according to the influence mechanism and the interdisciplinary citation mechanism .",
    "firstly , the non - interdisciplinary paper @xmath32 with coordinate @xmath33 is considered . for prior node @xmath38 ,",

    "this is in accordance with the actual situation that the reference length of papers can not grow infinitely .",
    "since the process of sprinkling nodes follows the poisson point process , the actual out - degree of node @xmath32 is not exactly equal to the expected out - degree .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the correct out - degree distribution , it is necessary to average the poisson distribution@xcite , @xmath72 which is the probability that node @xmath32 has out - degree @xmath73 , with the temporal density @xmath74 . in this model , @xmath75 so the out - degree distribution is @xmath76 it is a mixture poisson distribution similar to that of the empirical data .",
    "moreover , the curve in the forepart of the modeled in - degree distribution can be well fitted by the generalized poisson distribution ( fig  [ fig3]d ) .",
    "the interdisciplinary papers make the tail of the modeled out - degree distribution fat ( step 4 ) ( fig  [ fig3]d ) .",
    "thus , in combination with the non interdisciplinary papers , the out - degree distribution is @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the proportion of interdisciplinary papers , and @xmath79 refers to the power - law distribution defined in step 4 .",
    "the in - degree distributions of the empirical data have been investigated with the result showing that the curves in the forepart of the in - degree distributions can be well fitted by the generalized poisson distribution ( figs  [ fig3]b,[fig3]c ) .",
    "actually , the citations of one paper are affected by the new papers of its authors , and the probability of one paper receiving citations ( be selected from plenty of papers ) is small and not equal to that of other papers .",
    "these are the conditions in which the generalized poisson distribution can be applied@xcite . besides ,",
    "the in - degree distributions of the empirical data have a fat tail ( figs  [ fig3]b,[fig3]c ) which can be interpreted as a consequence of the cumulative advantage@xcite . in this model",
    ", this phenomenon is caused by the highly cited papers with large influence zones .",
    "now , an expression of the forepart and tail of the modeled in - degree distribution is derived to show how our model generates the similar curve and fat tail(fig  [ fig3]a ) .    for the modeled paper @xmath32 , it can receive citations from the papers located inside or outside of its influence zone .",
    "therefore , the expected in - degree of paper @xmath32 with coordinate @xmath33 is @xmath80 when @xmath70 is small , the first item in formula  ( [ eq6 ] ) is larger than the second item , so @xmath81 averaging the poisson distribution , the in - degree distribution in the large in - degree region is @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 . the laplace approximation and the stirling s approximation",
    "are used in this approximation .",
    "it can be proven that the integral term of @xmath85 is approximately independent of @xmath73 .",
    "the derivation process is as follows : @xmath86 when the in - degree @xmath73 is large enough , which is satisfied by the small @xmath17 ( formula  ( [ eq7 ] ) ) , the integration is approximately equal to a constant . in this way ,",
    "the modeled in - degree distribution in the large-@xmath73 has a power - law tail with exponent @xmath87 .",
    "when @xmath70 is large , the time derivative of the influence zone of paper @xmath32 is considered , @xmath88it means that the influence zone of paper @xmath32 in this model is approximately a constant when @xmath70 is large .",
    "hence , it is assumed that @xmath89 ( d is a constant ) .",
    "the expected in - degree of paper @xmath32 is @xmath90 and thus the in - degree distribution in the small in - degree region is @xmath91 it indicates that the in - degree distribution of the modeled network in the small in - degree region is a mixture poisson distribution similar to that of the empirical data .",
    "also , the in - degree distribution of the modeled network in the small in - degree region can be well fitted by the generalized poisson distribution ( fig  [ fig3]d ) .",
    "the local clustering coefficient is equal to the probability that two vertices , both neighbors of the third vertex , will be the neighbors of one another@xcite .",
    "also , it is found that the highly cited papers often have low local clustering coefficients in empirical data ( figs  [ fig4]b,[fig4]c ) . due to the short time span of the empirical data ( only ten years ) ( table  [ table1 ] ) ,",
    "the highly cited papers get lots of citations from the new published papers with few citations . in this paper ,",
    "the highly cited papers are considered and the formula of the relation between the highly cited papers and their local clustering coefficients is derived to show how well our model fits the tail of the local clustering coefficient .",
    "-2.25in0 in     suppose @xmath32 is a highly cited paper and @xmath70 is small enough .",
    "paper @xmath38 and paper @xmath92 are the new published papers , which are the neighbors of paper @xmath32 . if @xmath38 has coordinate @xmath39 , a reasonable assumption is made that the overlap of the influence zones of @xmath32 and @xmath38 in circle @xmath93 ( @xmath94 is the current time ) is approximately @xmath66 because of the small @xmath70 and large @xmath95 .",
    "particularly , if the connection probability @xmath42 equals to 1 , the probability that paper @xmath92 is the common neighbor of paper @xmath32 and paper @xmath38 is approximately equal to @xmath96 .",
    "thus , for the general connection probability @xmath42 , the conditional probability @xmath97 . the effect of the interdisciplinary papers is ignored here owing to the low probability that paper @xmath92 is an interdisciplinary paper and connects to paper @xmath32 and paper @xmath38 simultaneously .",
    "summing over the possible values of @xmath95 , it can be found that @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the number of the papers in the influence zone of paper @xmath32 at time @xmath95 .",
    "since paper @xmath32 is a highly cited paper , the papers citing @xmath32 dominate the neighbors of @xmath32 and the effect of papers cited by @xmath32 can be ignored .",
    "moreover , the expected in - degree of the highly cited paper @xmath32 is @xmath100 . by substituting it into eq  ( [ eq13 ] ) , we get @xmath101 which is inversely proportional to the in - degree @xmath73 of paper @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the local clustering coefficient of the highly cited paper @xmath32 in this model is also small . to show the similarity more clearly",
    ", the range of @xmath73 is divided into equal small intervals and @xmath102 for each interval is also averaged to reduce the noises caused by random factors ( fig  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the highly cited papers tend to cite the same highly cited papers in the empirical data , which means that they are in - assortative ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is intuitive that researchers are often wild about tracing back to hot topics .",
    "if the topics of papers have great research value , numerous researchers will focus on them and publish a large number of papers that will cite each other . as a result , these papers become highly cited as well . the empirical data are also out - assortative ( table  [ table1 ] ) , which refers to the tendency of papers to cite other papers with similar out - degrees to themselves . actually , the researchers often put emphasis on the new published papers that have novel contents .",
    "-2.25in0 in     -2.25in0 in     our model also has these two properties . to show the performance of this model ,",
    "the formulas of the scaling relations between the in- and out - degree of a node and the mean in- and out - degree of the neighbors pointing to and pointed at by the node are derived .",
    "the relations are denoted by @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .    for node @xmath32 , the coordinate of which",
    "is @xmath33 , the in - degrees of all nodes pointing to it are averaged , and found @xmath105 in this formula , some approximations are made , and they hold for small @xmath70 , meaning that formula  ( [ eq15 ] ) can only fit the tail of the scaling relation .",
    "therefore , substituting the in - degree @xmath73 of node @xmath32 born early into formula  ( [ eq15 ] ) , we get @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are constants . formula  ( [ eq16 ] ) is an increasing function , suggesting that the model is in - assortative .",
    "in addition , when in - degree @xmath73 is large enough , @xmath109 is approximately equal to a constant ( fig  [ fig5]a ) .",
    "it is close to the actual situation that a hot topic will be out of fashion .",
    "then @xmath110 is considered .",
    "if node @xmath32 is not an interdisciplinary paper , we could get @xmath111 substituting the expected out - degree of node @xmath32 into formula  ( [ eq17 ] ) , we get @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a constant . formula  ( [ eq18 ] ) is an increasing function about out - degree @xmath73 , whereas @xmath110 will not satisfy the result given by formula  ( [ eq18 ] ) ( fig  [ fig6]a ) if the out - degree of node @xmath32 is large , which shows that most nodes with large out - degrees represent interdisciplinary papers ( fig  [ fig3]d ) . if node @xmath32 is an interdisciplinary paper , the nodes that are pointed at by it are also interdisciplinary papers due to the out - assortativity of the model .",
    "so @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a constant .",
    "it indicates that the average out - degree of nodes pointed at by node @xmath32 fluctuates around a constant ( fig  [ fig6]a ) .",
    "meanwhile , the model is out - assortative , as the number of interdisciplinary papers in the model is small .",
    "a model of scientific citation networks with linearly growing node - increment is proposed , in which the influence mechanism and the interdisciplinary citation mechanism are involved . under appropriate parameters , the formula of the modeled network s in - degree",
    "distribution is derived , and it shows a similar behavior to the empirical data in the small in - degree region and a power - law tail in the large in - degree region .",
    "different from most previous models that just study the forepart of the out - degree distribution of the empirical data , this model also captures the fat tails .",
    "the model can also predict some other typical statistical features like clustering , in- and out - assortativity , giant component and clear community structure .",
    "for example , it vividly characterizes the academic influence power of papers by geometric zones , and interprets the power - law tails of citation networks in - degree distributions by the papers inhomogeneous influence power .",
    "therefore , it is believed that this model is a suitable geometric tool to study the citation networks .",
    "however , some shortcomings still need to be overcome in future work : how to design a mechanism to characterize the citations of the interdisciplinary papers rather than randomly and uniformly select the existing papers ; and how to model the out - degree distribution better .",

    "<S> due to the fact that the numbers of annually published papers have witnessed a linear growth in some citation networks , a geometric model is thus proposed to predict some statistical features of those networks , in which the academic influence scopes of the papers are denoted through specific geometric areas related to time and space . in the model , nodes ( papers ) </S>",
    "<S> are uniformly and randomly sprinkled onto a cluster of circles of the minkowski space whose centers are on the time axis . </S>",
    "<S> edges ( citations ) are linked according to an influence mechanism which indicates that an existing paper will be cited by a new paper located in its influence zone . </S>",
    "<S> considering the citations among papers in different disciplines , an interdisciplinary citation mechanism is added to the model in which some papers with a small probability of being chosen will cite some existing papers randomly and uniformly . </S>",
    "<S> different from most existing models that only study the power - law tail of the in - degree distribution , this model also characterizes the overall in - degree distribution . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it presents the description of some other important statistical characteristics of real networks , such as in- and out - assortativity , giant component and clear community structure . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is reasonable to believe that a good example is provided in the paper to study real networks by geometric graphs . </S>"
