    "a dark soliton in a quasi one dimensional ( 1d ) atomic bose einstein condensate ( bec ) is a particle - like solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "dark solitons were observed in two experiments @xcite .",
    "a classical soliton in a quasi-1d condensate in a harmonic trap behaves like a ( negative mass ) particle in a harmonic potential with a frequency equal to trap frequency divided by @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this results in a ( negative frequency ) anomalous mode in the spectrum of the bogoliubov theory .",
    "this mode describes small fluctuations of the soliton around the center of the trap .",
    "a soliton wave packet which is initially localized in the center of the trap is going to disperse @xcite .",
    "the width of the wave packet grows until it becomes comparable to the width of the soliton - the healing length . in refs.@xcite",
    "this dispersion was estimated to happen , for reasonable experimental parameters , on a time scale of @xmath1ms .",
    "this quantum `` instability '' , present even at zero temperature , adds to the list of more classical decay channels @xcite .",
    "the calculations in ref.@xcite were done within bogoliubov theory which is a linearized theory of small quantum fluctuations around a classical soliton localized in the center of the trap .",
    "this theory breaks down when fluctuations grow large because for large fluctuations one can not neglect interactions between bogoliubov modes .",
    "the perturbative theory breaks down when the width of the soliton wave packet becomes comparable with the healing length i.e. after around @xmath1ms from soliton creation . to extend the soliton diffusion beyond this point one has to treat the diffusion in a non - perturbative way .    in this paper",
    "i develop non - perturbative theory of soliton diffusion that includes both position and phase fluctuations . to avoid some technical problems , and also to afford more pedagogical presentation",
    ", i consider a soliton in uniform 1d condensate confined to a box of finite length .",
    "the finite length of the box makes quantum and thermal depletion from the 1d condensate finite .",
    "in fact finite quasi-1d condensates were observed in experiments @xcite in harmonic traps .",
    "a quasi-1d condensate in the thomas - fermi regime can be considered locally uniform on lengthscales comparable to the soliton width . what is more atom chips @xcite make possible confinement of cold atoms in a quasi-1d box .",
    "the dark soliton @xcite is a stationary solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation in 1d @xmath2 here @xmath3 is atomic mass and @xmath4 is effective 1d interaction strength .",
    "the system is placed in a box by imposing the boundary conditions @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the walls of the box .",
    "the stationary dark soliton is @xmath7 see figure [ figphi0 ] . here",
    "@xmath8 is ( linear ) density of the condensate , @xmath9 is the healing length , @xmath10 is the speed of sound , and @xmath11 is arbitrary global phase .",
    "i made a convenient choice of @xmath12 .",
    "i assume that the width of the soliton is much less than the size of the box , @xmath13 , and that the position of the soliton @xmath14 is at safe distance of a few healing lengths from the walls .",
    "this stationary solution is degenerate with respect to the soliton position @xmath14 and to the global phase @xmath11 of the condensate wave function .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ tdgpe ] ) can be linearized in small fluctuations @xmath15 around the stationary classical background ( [ gs ] ) : @xmath16 here the linear differential operator is @xmath17 the right eigenmodes of the non - hermitian @xmath18 are solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations @xmath19 every right eigenmode has a corresponding left eigenmode @xmath20 . the right eigenmodes can be classified as phonon modes ( @xmath21 ) and zero modes ( @xmath22 ) .      for later convenience",
    "i write first continuous spectrum @xmath23 and eigenfunctions for phonons on the background @xmath24 extending to @xmath25 , @xmath26~ , \\nonumber \\\\ & &   v_k(x , q)= \\frac{g\\rho}{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\xi}~\\epsilon_k } e^{ikx }   e^{i\\theta}\\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left [ \\left ( ( k\\xi)^2-\\frac{2\\varepsilon_k}{g\\rho } \\right ) \\left ( \\frac{k\\xi}{2}+i\\tanh\\frac{x - q}{\\xi } \\right ) + \\frac{k\\xi}{\\cosh^2\\frac{x - q}{\\xi } } \\right]~. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the soliton does not scatter phonons but shifts their phase : as @xmath27 or @xmath28 is passing from left to right the function @xmath29 is changing phase by @xmath30 .      in a box",
    "the wavevector @xmath31 is quantized . in figure [ figphi0 ]",
    "we can see a half - antikink at @xmath32 , a kink at @xmath33 , and another half - antikink at @xmath34 . in this background total phaseshift of a phonon passing from the left wall to the right wall of the box",
    "is @xmath35 and the quantization condition is the same as for a quantum particle in a box : @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "discrete bogoliubov modes are @xmath38 plus a formula for @xmath39 obtained by replacing @xmath40 with @xmath41 . with proper normalisation phonon modes",
    "satisfy the orthogonality relation : @xmath42 .",
    "in addition to phonons there are two zero modes with @xmath22 .",
    "one originates @xcite from the global @xmath43 gauge invariance @xmath44 broken by the classical solution ( [ gs ] ) : @xmath45 and the other from the translational invariance @xmath46 broken by the solution ( [ gs ] ) : @xmath47 the zero modes are orthogonal : @xmath48 .    unlike phonons",
    "both zero frequency modes also have zero norms : @xmath49 . as a result",
    ", phonon modes together with zero modes do not span the whole hilbert space in the functional space @xmath50 .",
    "for example , to find a coordinate of @xmath50 in the direction of the zero mode @xmath51 one has to project @xmath50 on an _ adjoint _ vector @xmath52 , @xmath53 which has unit overlap with the zero mode , @xmath54 , but is orthogonal to all other modes .    in a similar way , the translational mode @xmath55 requires an adjoint mode @xmath56 normalized so that @xmath57 , but orthogonal to all other modes including @xmath52 . in summary",
    ", two adjoint modes are missing in order to span the whole hilbert space of @xmath50 .      in the case of the dark soliton ( [ gs ] ) a vector @xmath58 adjoint to a zero mode",
    "@xmath59 turns out to be a solution of the inhomogeneous equation @xcite @xmath60 with a constant @xmath61 chosen so that the overlap @xmath62 .",
    "eq.([a ] ) warrants that the adjoint vector @xmath58 is an eigenstate of @xmath63 with eigenvalue @xmath64 .",
    "as such it is orthogonal to all phonon modes because phonon modes are eigenstates of @xmath63 with non - zero eigenvalues @xmath65 .    to find the adjoint vector to the gauge mode ( [ uvu1 ] ) it is good to start form a stationary gross - pitaevskii equation solved by @xmath66 in eq.([gs ] ) @xmath67 taking derivative of this equation and its complex conjugate with respect to @xmath8 gives @xmath68 comparing this equation with ( [ a ] ) and ( [ uvu1 ] ) and using @xmath69 gives @xmath70 the normalization condition @xmath71 requires that @xmath72 .",

    "recovers the general formula @xcite @xmath75    to get the adjoint vector to the translational mode ( [ uvq ] ) we verify first that @xmath76 here the envelope function is @xmath77 comparing this equation with eqs.([a],[uvq ] ) gives @xmath78 the normalization condition @xmath79 requires @xmath80 .",
    "the overlap between two adjoint modes should vanish but it does not : @xmath81 with real @xmath82 . this problem can be easily fixed because the solution of the inhomogeneous equation ( [ a ] ) is not unique - we can always add a zero mode of @xmath18 to the solution . using this freedom",
    "i replace the adjoint gauge mode as @xmath83 the new adjoint gauge mode has no overlap with the adjoint translational mode .",
    "putting together phonons and zero modes with their adjoint partners results in a decomposition of the unit operator as @xmath84 this decomposition is a foundation of the bogoliubov theory .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ tdgpe ] ) is a classical version of a second quantized theory with a hamiltonian @xmath85 here @xmath86 is a bosonic field operator . in standard perturbative treatment @xcite of zero modes",

    "such a wave function , and consequently also a state with definite @xmath135 , is beyond reach for the perturbative theory . in the subspace with @xmath136",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath139 in the same way , a wave packet for soliton position @xmath14 can disperse covering most of the box without contradicting assumptions of the theory .",
    "for example , initial width @xmath140 of a gaussian wave packet grows like @xmath141 this dispersion of soliton position becomes comparable to the soliton width , @xmath142 , at the time @xmath143 which depends on the initial dispersion @xmath140 . in between @xmath144 and @xmath145 a hole in single particle density distribution fills up with atoms , compare fig.[figrho0 ] .",

    "what is the minimal distance between the solitons @xmath149 when it becomes possible to distinguish these two condensates by a suitable quantum measurement ? to answer this question we must calculate overlap between these two condensates of @xmath116 atoms and see how it decays with the intersoliton distance , @xmath150 two condesates become orthogonal and in principle distinguishable when the intersoliton distance becomes greater than @xmath151 .",
    "this is fundamental limitation derived only from properties of the quantum states and not of any particular measurement technique .",
    "this fundamental limitation means that the initial gaussian wave packet can not be localized better than @xmath152 .",
    "this minimal dispersion leads to the minimal soliton diffusion time @xmath153 it is interesting to evaluate @xmath154 for the parameters of the hannover experiment @xcite .",
    "this condensate can be approximated by a quasi-1d harmonic trap like in ref.@xcite . in the present paper we consider uniform condensate in a box with linear density @xmath8 . using the linear density in the center of the effective quasi-1d trap as @xmath8 we obtain @xmath155ms .",
    "this is close to the time @xmath156 when solitons are observed to loose contrast in that experiment .",

    "condensate wave function for @xmath157 is @xmath158 with @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "calculation of zero modes and adjoint modes follows the same lines as for @xmath161 .",
    "mass of a moving soliton is @xmath162 and the overlap between condensates decays when the intersoliton distance becomes comparable to @xmath163 .",
    "the minimal soliton diffusion time is @xmath164 for hannover solitons @xcite moving with velocities @xmath165 the minimal time is @xmath166ms .",
    "this paper develops non - perturbative theory of zero modes in the bogoliubov theory of atomic bec . in the non - perturbative approach phase fluctuations and fluctuations of soliton position",
    "are not restricted to be small .",
    "this theory predics that an initially well localized soliton wave packet is going to disperse beyond the soliton width .",
    "when parameters of the present model are fit to the parameters of hannover experiment @xcite , then dispersion of soliton position becomes comparable to the soliton width after @xmath1ms from soliton creation .",
    "this number is consistent with earlier perturbative studies of soliton diffusion in a harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "this diffusion time is also consistent with the time when the dark soliton appears to loose contrast or gray in hannover experiment @xcite .",
    "interaction of the soliton with a thermal cloud was offered as an explanation @xcite of the observed graying .",
    "the quantum diffusion described here and in refs.@xcite is a mechanism that operates even in the @xmath167 quantum limit when the thermal cloud is turned off .",
    "the quantum diffusion mechanism could be tested in an experiment with variable temperature .",
    "another dissipation mechanism due to non - uniform condensate density was suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "the influence of the inhomogenity could be elliminated in an experiment with a static soliton ( @xmath161 ) in the center of the trap . in principle",
    "it is possible to make an experiment where the other mechanisms @xcite are turned off leaving the quantum diffusion as the only known instability of the dark soliton .",
