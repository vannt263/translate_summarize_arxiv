    "it is clearly seen that the diagram `` load - sag '' for the material under consideration has two extreme points @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "if the parameter of the load increases monotonely and reaches the value of the upper critical load , then there will be an abrupt passage of the system into a new equilibrium state , after which sags of the shell will again increase smoothly .",
    "the monotone decrease of the load @xmath30 ( unloading stage ) leads to the backward distortion of the shell to the initial equilibrium form at lower critical load .",
    "equilibrium states described by a falling part of the curve from the point @xmath82 to the point @xmath83 are unstable and they are not realized at all in the way of loading under consideration .    in conclusion",
    ", we consider to the main principles of choosing an initial approximation of the newton iteration process that allows us to get solutions of nonlinear algebraic system ( [ trotsenko:1.9 ] ) .",
    "if solutions of these equations are far from singular points @xmath82 and  @xmath83 , then one can construct an initial approximation , taking advantage of rapid convergence of solutions . as we can see from table 1 , the first rietz approximation is a good solution to the initial problem . in this case , we have to solve a system of two nonlinear algebraic equations .",
    "the initial approximation is determined from physically noncontradictory values of @xmath53 and  @xmath84 ( to the positive load there corresponds the positive sag of the shell )",
    ". then we use the obtained solution to construct @xmath85-th approximation , setting the first and @xmath86-th components of the vector @xmath44 equal to obtained values of @xmath53 and @xmath84 , and putting other components equal to zero . the initial approximation constructed in this way improved by employing the newton method with 45 iterations . in the case , when it is necessary to obtain a series of equilibrium states , when choosing initial values of the vector @xmath44 one can use different extrapolational formulae to prolong solutions in the parameter  @xmath30 .",
    "however , when implementing the procedure of prolonging a solution with approximation to critical points @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the convergence of the newton process sharply comes down , and then the divergence appears clearly . to go through these equilibrium states of the shell one should change prolongation parameters .",
    "the main point of this approach is that starting from some moment , the parameter of the load is supposed to be unknown , and as a given parameter we choose the value of the sag of the shell at the pole .",
    "artificial introduction of a new parameter provides that the uniqueness condition for a solution in a neighbourhood of a fixed parameter is fulfilled , and , therefore , jacobian is nondegenerate , which is a necessary condition for the newton method to be applicable .",
    "the algorithm proposed is also effective for other rotation shells in the nondeformed state , the generatrix of which intersects the symmetry axis at the right angle and principle curvatures at its pole are equal .",
    "let us consider the case of loading a membrane by a hydrostatic load for @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( heavy liquid ) .",
    "for such parameters of the load , stresses in the median surface of the deformed shell will be small , i.e. , @xmath89 , and the shell will take a nearly plane form with the exception of a narrow domain near the fixed contour of the membrane .",
    "the increase of the constant component of the load @xmath31 leads to the increase of stresses in the membrane , that begin to play the prevalent role in forming its deformed surface .",
    "this is accompanied by increasing the width of a domain with rapidly changing functions of movements and stresses , and turning a plane part of the surface of the shell into a curvilinear surface .          in the case under consideration , the presence of a small parameter at higher derivatives transfers the initial regular problem into a class of nonlinear singular perturbed problems . in this case",
    ", solutions will have domains both with fast and slow variability . as a result , when approximating solutions by means of polynomial basis , the convergence of successive approximations in the rietz method sharply comes down , and the increase of the number of coordinate functions in expansions ( [ trotsenko:1.7 ] ) leads to a loss of calculation stability before the required precision is achieved .",
    "the situation is also aggravate by that the singularity degree of the problem depends on a solution itself that is a priori unknown .",
    "thus , there arise the principal problem of extending a class of admissible functions by functions that allow getting within the framework of a unique algorithm approximate solutions with the equally high precision both in the presence of a narrow area of great changes in solutions and without it .",
    "the problem indicated plays a key role in realizing the method of variations when solving singularly perturbed boundary problems .",
    "it is one of suffuciently difficult problems of mathematical physics and theory of function approximation .",
    "apparently for this reason , variantional methods",
    "( unlike finite difference methods @xcite ) are not developed properly for solving even linear boundary problems with a small parameter the higher derivative .",
    "one of the most important merits of the method of variations is that when constructing approximate solutions , one can use an information about problem , that can be obtained by means of preliminary analysis of required solutions . on the other hand , methods of a small parameter",
