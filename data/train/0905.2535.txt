    "surely the most spectacular confirmed prediction of general relativity is the black hole .",
    "black holes are generally characterized by mass , charge and angular momentum . in the present paper",
    "i shall focus on mass because the electric charges of black holes in nature are likely to be extremely small while angular momentum will here be suppressed for no better reason than simplicity .",
    "i shall first introduce acronyms for three mass ranges of black hole in terms of the solar mass ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) have @xmath1 .",
    "intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) are defined by @xmath2 . because most black holes are in the mass range i designate as normal - mass black holes ( nmbhs ) @xmath3 .",
    "the compelling evidence for the existence of both smbhs and nmbhs is well known and need not be repeated here .",
    "the status of imbhs is reviewed in @xcite with the conclusion that their existence in nature is not absolutely certain . in the present paper ,",
    "i shall suggest on the basis of entropy arguments that many imbhs exist in galactic halos and it is the job of astronomers to detect them .",
    "entropy has at least two interesting properties .",
    "firstly there is probably an upper limit which arises from the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "second , there is the idea that it never decreases , the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "i shall employ throughout dimensionless entropy which means that boltzmann s formula is divided by his eponymous constant .",
    "entropy is a powerful concept in theoretical physics generally and may have found a ubiquitous application in cosmology .    in discussing the dimensionless entropy of the universe",
    "i encounter very large numbers like a googol ( @xmath4 ) and it will become clear how numbers below one googol are negligible . in discussing the number of microstates of the universe",
    "any number below one googolplex ( @xmath5 ) is insignificant .",
    "black holes focus entropy density so efficiently that the entropy of everything else in the universe is negligible compared to its black holes .",
    "since this is crucial in justifying my focus on black holes , let me begin by considering briefly the entropy of other components which contribute to the energy of the universe .",
    "these are approximately @xmath6 dark energy , @xmath7 dark matter and @xmath8 normal matter .",
    "i shall throughout make the assumption that the dark energy possesses no entropy .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the notation where @xmath9 denotes within one order of magnitude .",
    "@xmath9 means an integer greater than @xmath10 and less than @xmath11 .",
    "normal matter , other than relic photons and neutrinos , has entropy @xmath12 nowhere near to one googol .",
    "the photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have entropy @xmath13 , orders of magnitude bigger , still negligible .",
    "the relic neutrinos have entropy comparable in order of magnitude to the cmb .",
    "what about dark matter ? unlike dark energy",
    "it must possess statistical properties like temperature and entropy and , other than black holes , its dimensionless entropy must fall far short of one googol .",
    "i conclude that black holes overwhelmingly dominate cosmological entropy .",
    "from work @xcite ( pbh ) beginning four decades ago it is well established that the dimensionless entropy @xmath14 of a black hole with mass @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "as a first ( unrealistic ) example consider the sun which is normal matter with entropy @xmath17 .",
    "now take a black hole with the same mass : following the pbh analysis it has entropy @xmath18 .",
    "although the sun is too light ever to collapse to a black hole , this gedankenexperiment illustrates the compression of entropy by 21 orders of magnitude such that in any entropy inventory with black holes everything else can be jettisoned with impunity",
    ".    observed stellar nmbhs are at least three times the mass of the sun and have masses between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity i assume every nmbh has @xmath21 and therefore entropy @xmath12 .",
    "i shall assume the visible universe contains @xmath22 galaxies each with halo mass @xmath23 .    as a working estimate of the total entropy of nmbhs , i assume there are @xmath24 of them per galaxy and hence @xmath25 in the universe .",
    "their total pbh entropy is @xmath26 googols .",
    "let me turn now to the smbhs at galactic centers . from the southern hemisphere in the direction of the constellation sagittarius , where the milky way appears densest to the naked eye",
    ", there is good radio astronomical evidence for a smbh known as sag @xmath27 with mass of about four million solar masses .",
    "for simplicity i assume there is one smbh with mass @xmath28 in every galaxy .",
    "each has entropy @xmath29 and their total cosmological entropy is therefore @xmath30 googols .",
    "finally i arrive at my principal topic , the intermediate - mass black holes whose observational evidence is inadequate , as an example let me take all imbhs to have mass @xmath31 and entropy @xmath13 . according to fig",
    ". 1 as much as 10 percent of the @xmath23 halo can be imbhs so there can be @xmath32 per galaxy and @xmath33 in the universe giving cosmological entropy of @xmath34 googols and @xmath35 of total entropy .",
    "the holographic principle allows a total entropy of the universe up to @xmath36 googols achievable only if the universe were to become one big black hole quite different from the present situation .",
    "one reason that it is so urgent to seek and discover imbhs is that their contribution to cosmological entropy is germane to a better understanding of the correct alternative to the big bang .    in the cyclic model of ( baum & frampton 2007",
    "; baum & frampton 2008 ) which solves the tolman conundrum , the total entropy provides a lower limit on the number of universes spawned at turnaround ( baum , frampton & matsuzaki 2008 ) and is relevant to the infinite past ( frampton 2007 ; frampton 2009 ) .",
    "the cyclic model can solve purely classically the concern expressed in ( penrose 2005 ) about fine - tuning to less than a part in a googolplex at the start of an expansion era .",
    "there are two formation mechanisms which suggest themselves :    firstly , the imbhs may be remnants of population iii stars as discussed in @xcite .",
    "if so , the mass estimates for population iii stars have been too conservative and they may range up to @xmath37 .    secondly , numerical simulations @xcite of dark matter halos could be tightened to much higher spatial resolution and include realistic inelasticity or equivalent dynamical friction . in this way",
    "imbh formation could be studied assiduously .",
    "note that the largest imbh has a radius less than @xmath38 parsecs so the improvement must be by orders of magnitude .",
    "it is possible that imbh formation results sequentially from both mechanisms .",
    "the situation with respect to cosmological entropy is as if with respect to cosmological energy there remained ignorance of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "i have put stock in the second law of thermodynamics to predict that entropy is dominated by imbhs .",
    "the applicability of the second law to the evolution of the universe ignores dynamics yet i believe the dynamics would need to be pathological if imbhs do not prevail in the galactic halo .                    on the theoretical side",
    "the observed metallicity of intergalactic dust requires that population iii stars exist and little is established about their masses .",
    "i suggest that there may have once existed far higher - mass zero - metallicity stars than discussed in @xcite .      in conclusion ,",
    "i believe that the imbh entropy make up of the universe can be understood in a just few years .",
    "my question is for astronomers .",
    "what is the percentage contribution by intermediate - mass black holes to the total cosmological entropy ?"
