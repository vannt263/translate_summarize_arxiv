    "the informatics revolution has enabled the systematic gathering and handling of a large array of large scale networks data sets , enabling the analysis of their detailed structural features . in particular , mapping projects of the www and the physical internet offered the first chance to study the topology and traffic of large - scale networks .",
    "gradually other studies followed describing population networks of practical interest in social science , critical infrastructures and epidemiology ( albert and barabsi , 2002 ; newman , 2003 ; dorogovtsev and mendes , 2003 ; pastor - satorras and vespignani , 2004 ) .",
    "the possibility of accessing and mining large - scale data sets allows a more detailed statistical analysis and theoretical characterization of correlation patterns , hierarchies and community structure of these networks , along with the setup of new modeling frameworks .",
    "in particular , the systematic study of these systems has shown the ubiquitous presence of complex features , mathematically encoded in statistical distributions with heavy - tails , diverging fluctuations , self - organization and emerging phenomena and patterns .",
    "the statistical properties induced by these complex features indicate the presence of topological and structural properties that do not find an explanation in the paradigm put forward by erds and renyi with the random graph model ( erds and renyi , 1960 )",
    ". indeed , even if the erds - renyi model rationalizes the small - world property of networks ( i.e. the short distance measured in number of links among nodes ) , it fails in reproducing the high level of local cohesiveness observed in many networks ( watts and strogatz , 1998 ) .",
    "additionally , several of these networks are characterized by the statistical abundance of nodes with a very large degree @xmath0 ; i.e. the number of connections to other nodes .",
    "for these scale - free networks , the degree probability distribution @xmath1 spans over a wide range of @xmath0 values which signals the appreciable occurrence of large degree nodes , the hubs of the system . finally , it is important to remark that the topological features of networks turn out to be extremely relevant since they have a strong impact in assessing their physical properties such as robustness , vulnerability , or the ability to spread a disease ( barabsi and albert , 1999 ; dorogovtsev and mendes , 2003 ; pastor - satorras and vespignani , 2004 ) .",
    "more recently , the activity on complex networks has been extended to the characterization of weighted networks .",
    "this representation allows the consideration of features pertaining to the dynamics and traffic flows occurring on networks , adding another dimension in the description of these systems .",
    "also in this case , the analysis and the characterization of weighted quantities have pointed out the presence of large scale heterogeneity and non - trivial correlations ( barrat et al , 2004 ) .",
    "the weighted graph representation provides valuable elements that open the path to a series of questions of fundamental importance in the understanding of networks . among those ,",
    "the issue of how dynamics and structure affect each other and the impact of traffic flows on the basic properties of spreading and congestion phenomena . finally , it spurs the more theoretical questions on how all these properties may be considered in generative networks models .    in the realm of urban and environmental planning , spatial analysis and regional science , the interest for complex networks has noticeably increased during the last years . in his investigation of the structure of the modern urban fabric , salingaros ( 2001 and 2003 )",
    "invokes the concepts of small world network and scale free properties and suggests a parallelism between the city and an ecosystem .",
    "starting from the principle that connective webs are the main source of urban life , salingaros invites planners to apply complex networks analysis to understand properties such as resilience and self - organization .",
    "while these studies are mostly based on conceptual arguments , other authors ( shiode and batty , 2000 ; batty , 2001 and 2003 ) promote the development of quantitative analyses with a twofold perspective : ( i ) explaining the behavior of complex networks such as the world wide web in terms of geography , demography and economics ; and ( ii ) improving the efficiency of advanced spatial analysis gis - based tools , by integrating the foundation of complex networks analysis into geographic information science .",
    "batty ( 2001 ) along with salingaros acknowledges the existence of a link between efficient urban connectivity and self - preserving behaviors and fosters the development of complex networks to study the functional mechanisms of cities .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar approach has been extremely fruitful in the study of the internet in relation with the geographical and social environment ( yook et al , 2002 ; gorman , 2001 ; barthlemy et al , 2003 ; gorman and kulkarni 2004 ; pastor - satorras and vespignani , 2004 ; schintler et al , forthcoming ) .    in the domain of geographic information science , jiang and claramunt ( 2004 ) proposed to use complex network tools to investigate quantitatively the urban space syntax .",
    "aiming at the improvement of the effectiveness of network gis advanced analysis , they use topological measures of connectivity , average path length and generalised clustering to compare three large street networks of the cities of gvle , munich and san francisco .",
    "fertile research directions are also currently explored in the domain of transportation systems and human traffic analysis .",
    "for example , the small - world properties of the boston subway system have been characterized by latora and marchiori ( 2000 - 2003 ) and sen et al ( 2003 ) studied the topology of the indian railway network . at the urban level",
    ", a network study has been carried out by chowell et al ( 2003 ) using large scale simulations ( with census and demographic data integration ) in order to describe urban movements of individuals in portland , oregon ( usa ) . on a larger scale ,",
    "recent studies have focused on the network properties of major transportation infrastructure such as the us interstate highway network and the airport network .",
    "( gastner and newman , 2004 ; guimera et al , 2003 ) .",
    "finally , barrat et al ( 2004 ) have provided the first study of the worldwide airports network including the traffic flows and their correlation with the topological structure . in this research area",
    ", the network approach might provide relevant information on issues such as traffic analysis and risk assessment in case of damages and attacks .    in the present work we use a network approach to study the sardinian inter - municipal commuting network ( smcn ) , which describes the everyday work and study - led movements among @xmath2 municipalities in the italian region of sardinia .",
    "we obtain a weighted network representation in which the vertices correspond to the sardinian municipalities and the valued edges to the amount of commuting traffic among them .",
    "we provide a detailed quantitative study of the resulting network , aiming at a first characterization of the structure of human traffic at the inter - city level and its relation with the topological structure defined by the connectivity pattern among cities . very interestingly ,",
    "while the network topology appears to fit within the standard random graph paradigm , the weighted description offers a very different perspective with complex statistical properties of the commuting flows and highly non - trivial relations between weighted and topological properties .",
    "we discuss these properties in relation with the geographical , social and demographical aspects of the system and show the potentiality of the network approach as a valuable tool at various stages of the policy - making and environmental planning process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we describe the dataset . in section 3 ,",
    "we carry out the analysis of the topology of the network . in section 4",
    ", we analyze the traffic and weight properties of this network and in section 5 , we discuss the implications of our network analysis results in terms of urban and environmental planning . in section 6 ,",
    "we compare topological and weighted network analysis results with socio - economic characteristics of the sardinian municipalities and we discuss their relations .",
    "we finally summarize our results in section 7 , while in section 8 we discuss the different research directions that this work suggests .",
    "sardinia is the second largest mediterranean island with an area of approximately @xmath3 square kilometers and @xmath4 inhabitants .",
    "its geographical location and morphological characters have determined an important history of commercial and cultural relations with trans - borders external communities and have also favoured the development of a strong social identity and of important political movements toward self - reliance and autonomy . at the date of 1991 ,",
    "the island was partitioned in @xmath2 municipalities , the second simplest body in the italian public administration , each one of those generally corresponding to a major urban centre ( in figure 1 , on the left , we report the geographical distribution of the municipalities ) . for the whole set of municipalities the italian national institute of statistics ( istat , 1991a ) has issued the origin - destination table ( odt ) corresponding to the commuting traffic at the inter - city level .",
    "the odt is constructed on the output of a survey about commuting behaviors of sardinian citizens .",
    "this survey refers to the daily movement from the habitual residence ( the origin ) to the most frequent place for work or study ( the destination ) : the data comprise both the transportation means used and the time usually spent for displacement . hence , odt data give access to the flows of people regularly commuting among the sardinian municipalities .",
    "in particular we have considered the external flows @xmath5 which measure the movements from any municipality @xmath6 to the municipality @xmath7 and we will focus on the flows of individuals ( workers and students ) commuting throughout the set of sardinian municipalities by all means of transportation .",
    "this data source allows the construction of the sardinian inter - municipal commuting network ( smcn ) in which each node corresponds to a given municipality and the links represent the presence of a non - zero flow of commuters among the corresponding municipalities .",
    "the standard mathematical representation of the resulting network is provided by the adjacency matrix @xmath8 of elements ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the elements on the principal diagonal ( @xmath10 ) are set equal to zero , since intra - municipal commuting movements are not considered here .",
    "off - diagonal terms @xmath9 are equal to @xmath11 in the presence of any non - zero flow between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath5 or @xmath12 ) and are equal to @xmath13 otherwise .",
    "the adjacency matrix is then symmetric and describes regular bi - directional displacements among the municipalities .",
    "the adjacency matrix contains all the topological information about the network but the dataset also provides the number of commuters attached to each link .",
    "it is therefore possible to go beyond the mere topological representation and to construct a weighted graph where the nodes still represent the municipal centres but where the links are valued according to the actual number of commuters .",
    "analogously to the adjacency matrix @xmath8 , we thus construct the symmetric weighted adjacency matrix @xmath14 in which the elements @xmath15 are computed as the sum of the @xmath5 and @xmath12 flows between the corresponding municipalities ( per day ) .",
    "the elements @xmath15 are null in the case of municipalities @xmath6 and @xmath7 which do not exchange commuting traffic and by definition the diagonal elements are set to zero . according to the assumption of regular bi - directional movements along the links , the weight matrix is symmetric and the network is described as an undirected weighted graph .",
    "the weighted graph provides a richer description since it considers the topology along with the quantitative information on the dynamics occurring in the whole network .",
    "it is however important to stress that while the nodes correspond to municipalities located in the physical space , the graph representation does not contain any information explicitly related to geographical distances and other spatial characteristic of the network .",
    "the definition of a network representation that correlates topological and traffic characteristics with the spatial properties of the smcn requires more refined investigation and will be presented elsewhere ( de montis et al , forthcoming ) .",
    "in this section , we analyze the topology of the smcn and we propose possible territorial explanations for our findings .",
    "this network is relatively small being characterized by @xmath16 vertices and @xmath17 edges .",
    "the degree @xmath0 of nodes , which measures the number of links of each node , ranges between @xmath18 and @xmath19 and exhibits a high average value .",
    "the degree can be considered as a first indication of the topological centrality of a vertex : the importance of the corresponding municipal centre as attraction point for commuters in the network .",
    "a measure of the topological distance within the network is given by the shortest path length defining the distance between nodes in terms of links to be traversed by using the shortest possible path between the nodes .",
    "on the average , the shortest path length is @xmath20 , while the maximum length is just equal to @xmath21 .",
    "these values are small compared to the number of nodes , in agreement with a small - world behavior for which l typically scales as the logarithm of @xmath22 .",
    "further information on the network s topology is provided by the degree distribution @xmath1 defined as the probability that any given node has degree @xmath0 . in this case",
    "it is essential to distinguish between an exponential network similar to the usual random graph for which @xmath1 decreases exponentially fast , and scale - free networks indicative of hub - like hierarchies for which @xmath1 decreases typically as a power law ( albert and barabasi , 2002 ; amaral et al , 2000 ) . in the present case ,",
    "the degree probability distribution is skewed and is relatively peaked around a mean value of order @xmath23 ( figure 2 ) .",
    ".5 cm    the tail of the distribution contains outliers with respect to a regular exponential decay , signaling the presence of municipal hubs , which exchange commuters with many others municipalities .",
    "however , a closer inspection of the distribution tail shows that the decay is not compatible with a heavy - tailed distribution .",
    "the tail has indeed a power - law behavior however with an exponent that ensures the convergence of the relevant moments of the distribution and does not imply a scale - free heterogeneity . in particular , the variance converges to a finite limit for infinitely large systems in contrast with scale - free networks , which have an infinite variance for infinite size networks .",
    "a further relevant topological quantity is the clustering coefficient defining a measure of the level of cohesiveness around any given node .",
    "it is expressed as the fraction of connected neighbors @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of links between the neighbors of the node @xmath6 and @xmath26 is the maximum number of possible interconnections among the neighbors of the node .",
    "this quantity is defined in the interval @xmath27 $ ] and measures the level of local interconnectedness of the network . if @xmath28 , the neighbors of the node @xmath6 are not interconnected at all , while @xmath29 corresponds to the case where all the neighbors are interconnected .",
    "a large clustering thus indicates the existence of a locally well - connected neighborhood of nodes .",
    "it is often convenient to average @xmath30 over all nodes with a given degree @xmath0 obtaining the clustering spectrum @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total number of nodes of degree @xmath0 . in figure 3 , on the left , we plot the clustering spectrum of the smcn : we observe a decaying behavior with @xmath33 that varies from @xmath34 to values lower than @xmath35 .",
    "this indication of a decreasing clustering suggests that the smcn behaves like other studied real networks , in that low degree municipalities belong to well interconnected working or studying communities while the high degree vertices , the urban hubs , connect otherwise disconnected regions .",
    "it is worth noting that this result is similar to the one obtained by chowell et al ( 2003 ) for urban movement .",
    "there is a striking difference however since the smcn is topologically very close to a random graph while the network studied in chowell et al ( 2003 ) is a scale - free network .",
    "this similarity with a random graph is also confirmed by the average value of the clustering coefficient @xmath36 , that results to be of the same order of the clustering coefficient theoretically computed for the case of a generalized random graph , which is @xmath37 predicting the value @xmath38 .    another important property is the degree similarity of the neighbors of a node .",
    "this is measured by the average degree of the nearest neighbors of a given node @xmath6 @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the set of neighbors of @xmath6 .",
    "analogously to the clustering coefficient , we can average the assortativity over nodes with a given degree leading to @xmath41 this spectrum measures the tendency of vertices to be connected with vertices with the same degree properties .",
    "if @xmath42 increases with @xmath0 , nodes have a tendency to connect to nodes with a similar or larger degree and the network is said to be assortative .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath42 is decreasing with @xmath0 , small degree nodes connect preferentially to hubs and the network is defined as disassortative .",
    "the result obtained for the smcn is shown in figure 3 , on the right , and displays a @xmath43 with decreasing trend .",
    "this result seems to indicate that the smcn belongs to the class of disassortative mixed networks .",
    "the disassortative behavior is typical of technological and transportation network and signals the presence of a global hierarchy in which the hubs tend to provide the connectivity to the small degree nodes at the periphery of the network .",
    "the odt dataset provides the number of commuters among municipalities , allowing the construction of the weighted graph representation of the smcn .",
    "the analysis of these commuting flows informs us on the system dynamical behavior and on the needs of the commuters in terms of regional transportation services and infrastructure .",
    "this information might provide relevant indication to researchers and decision - makers for addressing environmental policies and planning .",
    "the values of the weights between pairs of vertices ranges between @xmath11 and @xmath44 with an average value @xmath45 much lower than @xmath46 .",
    "this fact is a signature of a high level of heterogeneity in the smcn , since a peaked distribution of weights would very unlikely give a maximum value that is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the average .",
    "indeed , the probability distribution @xmath47 that any edge has a weight @xmath48 displays a power - law decay @xmath49 with an exponent @xmath50 ( figure 4 , on the left ) .    ) . on the right : log - log plot of the probability distribution of the strength ( as a guide to the eye we also plot a power law fit of exponent @xmath51).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=24.0% ] ) . on the right : log - log plot of the probability distribution of the strength ( as a guide to the eye we also plot a power law fit of exponent @xmath51).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=24.0% ]    another relevant quantity that characterizes the traffic is given by the strength of a node , defined as @xmath52 this quantity corresponds to the total traffic commuting in the town @xmath6 and can be considered as a measure of the traffic centrality of a municipality . for the smcn",
    ", the strength varies between @xmath11 and @xmath53 while its average value is equal to @xmath54 .",
    "the probability distribution of the strength @xmath55 that any given node has a strength @xmath56 is fitted by a power - law regime @xmath57 with exponent @xmath58 ( figure 4 , on the right ) .",
    "the strength provides an intuitive parameter for the description of the centrality of sardinian municipalities according to the actual traffic handled generated and received by the municipality .    in the first instance , the variation in the weight and strength values implies that commuters flows are distributed in a broad spectrum with a large heterogeneity .",
    "it is worth commenting the implications of a power - law behavior of the statistical distributions @xmath55 and @xmath47 .",
    "this behavior defines the so - called heavy tailed distributions which have a virtually unbounded variance .",
    "a peculiar fact about a distribution with a heavy tail is that there is a finite probability of finding vertices with weight or strength much larger than the average value . in other words ,",
    "the consequence of heavy tails is that the average behavior of the system is not typical .",
    "the characteristic weight ( or strength ) is the one that , picking up a vertex at random , should be encountered most of the times .",
    "this is evident in the bell - shaped distribution observed for the degree of the smcn , in which the average value is very close to the maximum of the distribution and represents the most probable value in the system . on the contrary ,",
    "the distributions shown in figure 4 are highly skewed .",
    "vertices have an appreciable probability of having large strength values , yet all intermediate values are probable and their mean does not represent any special value for the distribution .",
    "the power - law behavior and the relative exponent thus represent a quantitative measure of the level of heterogeneity of the network s traffic .",
    "another important question concerns the distribution of the traffic among the different roads .",
    "all the connections could carry a similar flow or on the contrary one connection could dominate . a convenient measure of this is given by the disparity ( barthlemy et al , 2005 ) , defined as @xmath59 for hubs ( @xmath60 ) , this quantity enables to distinguish situations ( figure 5 , on the right ) for which all weights are of the same order ( @xmath61 ) from situations where only a small number of connections dominate ( @xmath62 is of order 1/n where @xmath63 ) .",
    "we computed the value of @xmath62 for each node and we average these quantities for each degree in order to obtain @xmath64 .",
    "the result is shown on figure 5 , on the left .",
    "we obtain here an average behavior of the form @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "this result shows that the weights on the links attached to a given node are very heterogeneous . in other words",
    ", there are only a few dominant connections , while the traffic on all the other roads is very small .",
    "is of order @xmath11 ; in contrast if all connections have the same weight , @xmath62 is of order @xmath67.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=25.0% ]   is of order @xmath11 ; in contrast if all connections have the same weight , @xmath62 is of order @xmath67.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=25.0% ]      in order to inspect in more detail the relation between the degree and the traffic , we show in figure 6 the strength of nodes as a function of their degree . despite the existence of inevitable fluctuations , we observe over a wide range of degrees a power - law behavior of the form @xmath68 with an exponent @xmath69 .",
    "independent weights and connectivities would give a value @xmath70 ( barrat et al , 2004 ) and the result obtained here reveals that there is strong correlation between the traffic and the topology .",
    "the strength of the nodes grows faster than their degree : the more a municipality is connected with other centres the much more it is able to exchange commuters flows or , in other terms , the traffic per connection is not constant and increases with the number of connections .",
    "= 2.0 in    the presence of weights also alters the definition of other structural measures .",
    "for instance , the standard topological clustering coefficient used in the previous section needs to be augmented by the inclusion of the actual traffic . in order to understand the weight structure and their relation with topology , the weighted clustering coefficient can be defined as follows ( barrat et al , 2004 ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an element of the adjacency matrix and where @xmath73 is a normalization factor which ensures that @xmath74 belongs to @xmath27 $ ] . as for the topological case it is possible to average over all nodes of same degree",
    "@xmath0 obtaining the clustering spectrum @xmath75 .",
    "the weighted clustering coefficient counts for each triple formed in the neighborhood of the vertex i the weight of the two participating edges starting from i. in this way , we are not just considering the number of closed triangles but also their total relative weight with respect to the vertex strength . in the case of random networks",
    "@xmath76 but in real weighted networks , we can however face two different situations .",
    "if @xmath77 the topological clustering is generated by edges with low weight and therefore the cohesiveness is less important in terms of traffic properties . on the contrary , if @xmath78 we are in presence of a network in which the interconnected triples are more likely formed by edges with larger weight .",
    "we show in figure 7 ( on the right ) an example of such a situation .",
    "it is clear that the interconnected triple has a major role in the network dynamics and organization , and that the clustering properties are not completely exploited by a simple topological analysis .",
    "the weighted clustering coefficient takes into account the weighted elements by an appropriate mathematical form .    in the smcn",
    "the values of the weighted clustering coefficient are larger than the corresponding topological values @xmath78 ( figure 7 , on the left ) over the entire range of degree values .",
    "in contrast with the topological clustering , the weighted clustering coefficient is approximately constant over the whole range of connectivity .",
    "this result reveals the existence of a rich - club phenomenon in that important cities form a group of well interconnected nodes and that weight heterogeneity is enough in order to balance the lack of topological clustering .",
    "the rich - club phenomenon implies that in the smcn the interconnected triplets are more frequently built by edges with a higher weight ( figure 7 , on the right ) : in terms of local cohesiveness of workers and students commuting system , two different destinations available from a given city are more likely to be connected if the traffic flow leading to them is large .",
    "similarly to the weighted clustering , we need to integrate the information on weights in a sensible definition of assortativity / disassortativity .",
    "this can be easily done by introducing the weighted average degree of the nearest neighbors of a given node @xmath6 @xmath79         in this case , we perform a local weighted average of the nearest neighbor degree according to the normalized weight of the connecting edges .",
    "this definition implies that @xmath80 if the edges with the larger weights are pointing to the neighbors with larger degree and @xmath81 in the opposite case .",
    "the @xmath82 thus measures effective affinity to connect with high or low degree neighbors according to the magnitude of the actual interactions . in the smcn",
    "the weighted average degree of the nearest neighbors displays a slightly increasing pattern , which is a signature of assortativity ( figure 8) .",
    "this result is in sharp contrast with the behavior of the topological disassortativity and indicates an affinity of high - degree municipalities with other large centers with which they exchange high number of commuters : hubs have more frequently large traffic flows with municipalities with the same or higher - order degree .",
    "this phenomenon is illustrated on figure 8 , on the right : large weights connect hubs while the connection with nodes of smaller degree has smaller weights .",
    "the ranking connected to the degree ( table 1 ) , an index of topological centrality , confirms the existence of administrative and socio - economic hierarchies : among the hubs , cagliari is the most populated and regional capital town , nuoro , oristano and sassari are province capital towns , macomer and quartu santelena are emerging productive and residential centres .",
    ".ranking of sardinian municipalities by their degree @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , the existence of the municipality hierarchy that we have uncovered with the help of a weighted network analysis is confirmed by comparing demographic and economic urban polarization in sardinia .",
    "population and wealth , as proxies of the endowment of local resources , display a positive correlation with topological and dynamic centrality , strengthening the value of the network approach as a general tool for the analysis of inter - urban transportation systems .",
    "the results of this investigation open further questions that are currently under study .",
    "the indication of network centrality provides a powerful measure of similarity of the municipalities in attracting workers and students daily , more work however is needed to tackle the problem of the precise identification of the communities of workers / students commuting in sardinia and their geographical basins .",
    "these studies may provide insights for bottom - up processes of decision - making and planning based on the definition of the existing emerging behaviors of the citizens . finally , the smcn is obviously not independent from geography and space .",
    "it refers to a physical network , mostly based on road systems , which display precise geographical characteristics .",
    "further studies which include spatial aspects of the network are currently under progress .",
    "this forthcoming analysis will hopefully provide decision - makers and planners with relevant indications on the global effect of new infrastructure .",

    "<S> we study the structure of the network representing the interurban commuting traffic of the sardinia region , italy , which amounts to 375 municipalities and 1,600,000 inhabitants . </S>",
    "<S> we use a weighted network representation where vertices correspond to towns and the edges to the actual commuting flows among those . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize quantitatively both the topological and weighted properties of the resulting network . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the statistical properties of commuting traffic exhibit complex features and non - trivial relations with the underlying topology . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize quantitatively the traffic backbone among large cities and we give evidences for a very high heterogeneity of the commuter flows around large cities . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the interplay between the topological and dynamical properties of the network as well as their relation with socio - demographic variables such as population and monthly income . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis may be useful at various stages in environmental planning and provides analytical tools for a wide spectrum of applications ranging from impact evaluation to decision - making and planning support . </S>"
