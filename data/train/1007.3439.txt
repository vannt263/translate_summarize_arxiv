    ", we set the radius of the ab ring to 500  nm , which corresponds to approximately half of the experimental size .",
    "the reduced size influences the interference in two ways .",
    "firstly , the period of the ab oscillation increases to @xmath67  mt compared to @xmath81  mt observed in the experiment and secondly , the energy scale of resonances in the arms of the ring changes , and fluctuations in the transmission amplitude occur on a larger energy scale , see fig .  [ aharonovbohmpotential](b ) .",

    "the experimental currents are of the order of 12  na leading to bias voltages of 0.03 to 0.1  mv .",
    "the effective electron temperature was estimated to be between 100 and 150  mk , which gives rise to a thermal broadening of @xmath82  mev .",
    "since both energy scales are comparable with fluctuations in the transmission probabilities , the linear regime is not applicable and we solve the system of nonlinear equations .",
    "nevertheless the applied currents are small enough so that the landauer formula is still a good description .    with increasing temperature and current the amplitude of the ab oscillations decreases and finer structures in the fermi - energy dependency smear out .",
    "remarkably , finite currents qualitatively change the phase behavior of the ab oscillations , which becomes especially visible in the local regime where phase rigidity gets slightly lifted . for certain",

    "the tendency depends on the direction of the applied current and hence the experimental ac lock - in technique , where the measured signal is an average over negative as well as positive currents , is taken into account in our simulations . additionally , we find that also details of the experimental measurement setup influence the ab oscillations .",
