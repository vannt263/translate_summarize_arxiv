    ", research often goes along the lines of searching in the `` neighborhood '' of known superconductors .",
    "this has been the case of mgb@xmath3  that owes its superconducting ( sc ) properties@xcite essentially to the presence of holes in the @xmath8 @xmath4 b - b covalent bonds , strongly coupled with the @xmath9 stretching mode . during the last years",
    ", mgb@xmath3  boosted experimental and theoretical research in the class of diborides , layered , graphite - like materials , all sharing some hopefully relevant features with the `` parent compound '' .",
    "although this effort did not succeed in finding superconductors with better ( or at least equivalent ) properties than mgb@xmath3 , it brought to the experimental discovery of some new superconductors like graphite intercalated compounds@xcite , boron doped diamond@xcite , and to some theoretical proposals@xcite .    among mgb@xmath3-like materials ,",
    "one interesting case is represented by casi@xmath3 , which at ambient pressure has a rhombohedral structure and changes to a trigonal phase between @xmath10 7 and 9.5 gpa . at @xmath11",
    "gpa , casi@xmath3 has the _ alb@xmath3 _ structure and sc critical temperatures ( @xmath12 ) up to 14  k. the stability of the _",
    "alb@xmath3 _ phase at ambient pressure is achieved through hole doping .",
    "the stabilization process has been related@xcite to the filling of the @xmath7  antibonding bands ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "let us consider a material cax@xmath0si@xmath1 ( x having a lower valence than si ) : increasing @xmath14 from zero introduces holes in the @xmath13  bands , with a change in the x - si bond that from an @xmath15-like character acquires a progressive @xmath8 character , stabilizing the _ alb@xmath3 _ structure@xcite .",
    "thus , hole - doped casi@xmath3 could represent ( with some differences ) a good candidate for an mgb@xmath3-like material , although its stabilization at high pressure poses some problems .",
    "nevertheless , experimentally , the _ alb@xmath3 _ phase was observed at ambient pressure by doping casi@xmath3 with al@xcite or , in a much less studied case , with be @xcite .",
    "recently , cabe@xmath0si@xmath1was investigated in the doping range @xmath16 @xcite and was observed to have the _ alb@xmath3 _ structure at @xmath17 @xcite and , against the expectations , not to be a superconductor down to 4.2 k @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to clarify why this happens despite the presence of @xmath4  holes , as in mgb@xmath3 , and an even more pronounced nesting .",
    "we investigate the normal and sc phase of cabe@xmath0si@xmath1at @xmath2 ( cabesi  in the following)@xcite , in the _",
    "alb@xmath3 _ phase , with be and si atoms alternating within the honeycomb layers with an @xmath18 stacking .    the paper is organized as follows : in secs .",

    "[ superres ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ concl ] , we summarize our results .",
    "the superconducting properties are studied within the density functional theory for superconductivity ( scdft ) @xcite , a completely parameter free approach which allows to predict the sc gap and @xmath5values of real materials @xcite . as the scdft method was discussed in full detail in previous papers@xcite",
    ", here we only sketch the main points concerning the theory , whose central result is the generalized , self - consistent , gap equation : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the electronic band index and the bloch wave vector ; @xmath22   is the sc gap function ; @xmath23 is the inverse temperature ; @xmath24 are the sc quasiparticle energies , defined in terms of the gap function , the kohn - sham eigenenergies @xmath25 of the normal state and the chemical potential @xmath26 .",
    "the _ universal _",
    "kernel @xmath27   appearing in eq .",
    "( [ gapeq ] ) consists of two contributions   @xmath28 , representing the effects of the e - ph and the e - e interactions respectively .",
    "@xmath29   is temperature dependent and involves the e - ph coupling matrix elements @xmath30 and the phonon spectrum @xmath31 , while @xmath32 contains the matrix elements of the screened coulomb repulsion . finally , the _",
    "universal _ diagonal ( and temperature dependent ) term @xmath33 plays a similar role as the renormalization term in the eliashberg equations .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ gapeq ] ) is not a mean - field equation ( as in bcs theory ) , since it contains correlation effects via the sc exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional entering @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , it has the form of a static equation ",
    "i.e. , it does not depend _ explicitly _ on the frequency  and therefore has a simpler structure ( and computationally more manageable ) than the eliashberg equations .",
    "however , this certainly does not imply that retardation effects are absent from the theory . once again",
    ", retardation effects enter through the xc functional , as explained in refs .   .",
    "an important feature of the scdft approach is the capability to include the @xmath36-resolved coulomb repulsion @xmath37 _ ab - initio _ , without any adjustable parameter .",
    "the coulomb interaction was screened with a static dielectric matrix , within the random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite(see below ) .",
    "the electronic band structure @xmath38 , the phonon spectrum @xmath31 , and the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) and coulomb matrix elements ( me ) with respect to the bloch functions necessary to solve the sc gap ( eq . [ gapeq ] ) , were obtained within the planewave - pseudopotential method @xcite .",
    "we used troullier - martins@xcite , norm - conserving pseudopotentials@xcite , with 2s , 3s-3p and 3s-3p-4s for be , si and ca , respectively , in the gga - pbe@xcite approximation for the xc functional .",
    "the electronic self - consistent cycle was performed with a 60 ry energy cut - off , a @xmath39 monkhorst - pack @xmath21-point mesh .",
    "the optimized lattice parameters ( at @xmath2 be doping ) are @xmath40   and @xmath41 , whereas the experimental values ( at @xmath17 ) are @xmath42     and @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "our obtained , slightly smaller gga - pbe @xmath44 constant is justified by the larger amount of be ( with smaller covalent radius than si ) present in the calculated system .",
    "phonons and e - ph me were calculated via density functional perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the phonons were computed on the irreducible set of a regular mesh of @xmath45 @xmath46-points , and a @xmath47 monkhorst - pack @xmath21-points for electronic integration , with a smearing parameter of 0.35 ev .",
    "these parameters were sufficient to achieve convergence within 0.5  mev in the frequency of the @xmath48 mode .",
    "our calculated @xmath49mev compares well with the value @xmath50mev obtained by frozen phonon calculations in ref .  , computed at the slightly larger @xmath51   . the e - ph me were calculated on the same @xmath46-points grid as the phonons , and on a denser grid of @xmath52 @xmath21-points , while the rpa screened coulomb me were calculated@xcite on a mesh of @xmath53 @xmath21 and @xmath54-points .",
    "the sc gap function is extremely peaked around the fermi surface ( within the characteristic phonon energy ) , whereas at higher energies it is rather smooth ( and it changes sign , due to the e - e interaction ) .",
    "this implies that a converged solution of eq .",
    "( [ gapeq ] ) needs a denser @xmath21-points sampling around @xmath55 , while a coarser one is sufficient elsewhere .",
    "this highly non uniform mesh of the brillouin zone is realized with @xmath56 and @xmath57 independent @xmath21-points for bands crossing and not crossing the fermi level respectively .",
    "finally , 15 - 20 self consistent iterations were sufficient to achieve a complete convergence of the gap .",

    "cabesi  is isostructural and isoelectronic to mgb@xmath3  and the electronic , vibrational properties and electron - phonon interaction of the two materials are compared directly : while the band structures present strong similarities , with both @xmath4  and @xmath7  bands crossing the fermi level , the phonon structure and the e - ph interaction differ substantially . in particular , the less localized @xmath4   charge of cabesi  brings to a dramatic reduction in the @xmath9 electron - phonon coupling , with a consequent reduction of the phonon renormalization seen in mgb@xmath3 .",
    "this fact makes cabesi  a weak coupling superconductor with e - ph @xmath58 and @xmath5@xmath59  k , in spite of a nesting at the fermi surface twice as big as in mgb@xmath3  .",
    "interestingly , cabesi  exhibits three superconducting gaps at the fermi level .",
    "while , as in mgb@xmath3 , the @xmath4-@xmath7  gap splitting is related to the different e - ph coupling in these bands , the further @xmath60-@xmath13  splitting is a pure effect of the complex structure of the anisotropic coulomb repulsion , acting in different way on the @xmath60  and @xmath13  states .",
