    "a novel `` zero - resistance state '' ( zrs ) was observed a few years ago , when a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , subjected to a weak magnetic field , was also irradiated with microwaves.@xcite in the zrs state , the dc resistance measured in a hall bar experiment appeared to vaniish , while correspondingly , the longitudinal conductivity @xmath0 , measured in a corbino geometry appeared to be zero .",
    "a related phenomenon of microwave - induced resistance oscillations had been observed earlier in samples of lower quality , in which there are changes in the dc resistance produced by the microwave irradiation , which depend in an oscillatory manner on the ratio of the microwave frequency to the cyclotron frequency of the 2deg , but where the resistance was not driven down to zero.@xcite    following the discovery of the zrs , a phenomenological explanation was put forward.@xcite it was assumed that for microwave power above a certain threshold , for an appropriate sample , in certain ranges of the magnetic field and microwave frequency , the microwave - induced resistance oscillations would increase to the point where the differential longitudinal conductivity would become negative at zero dc electric field , and it was noted that in this case that the zero - electric - field solution would necessarily be unstable .",
    "it was argued that the sample would spontaneously break up into a pattern of domains , separated by domain walls . within each domain , the magnitude of the electric field would be a constant , @xmath1 , dependent on the strength of the microwave field and other parameters , which satisfies a condition that the longitudinal current generated by the field is zero .",
    "the direction of the electric field would change discontinuously at a domain wall , and might also vary continuously within a domain .",
    "it was assumed that the domain walls could move rather easily , so that , _ e.g. _ , if a finite voltage is applied between the inner and outer edges of a corbino sample , the system would respond by a displacement of domain walls , without causing the magnitude of the field to deviate from the critical value @xmath1 , and without inducing a longitudinal current in the sample .",
    "if one accepts this general picture , an obvious question is what determines the domain pattern in any given sample ?",
    "in fact , one may question whether there is necessarily a static domain pattern at all .",
    "since the system is driven out of equilibrium by the constant absorption of microwave radiation , it is possible in principle that the system will enter a time - dependent state , where domain walls may move about in a chaotic , or possibly quasiperiodic , manner .",
    "it is our purpose here to address this question .",
    "we shall argue that time - dependent states are likely to occur in at least some situations , and we shall propose one experimental geometry where it should be possible to observe this time - dependence .",
    "the dc properties of a time - dependent state should be similar to those of a state with static domain walls ; in particular the observed value of @xmath0 should be zero , or at least very small compared to the conductivity in the absence of microwave radiation .",
    "at least two different microscopic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the microwave - induced resistance oscillations at lower microwave intensities , and to produce the negative zero - field conductance assumed in the macroscopic model of zrs : a `` displacement mechanism''@xcite , in which the absorption of a microwave photon by an electron leads ( for appropriate values of parameters ) to a disorder - assisted displacement of the cyclotron orbit in an up - hill direction with regard to the local dc electric field ; and a `` population mechanism''@xcite , in which absorption of the microwave photons leads to a population inversion in the partially filled landau levels close to the fermi level .",
    "although these mechanisms may lead to quite different estimates for such parameters as the threshold microwave power or for the critical field @xmath1 at a given level of microwave irradiation , it appears that they give rise to qualitatively similar phenomenological models . in any case",
    ", we shall not make any assumptions about the particular microscopic mechanism in this work .    in formulating the equations of phenomenological model , it is convenient to divide the local electric current into a longitudinal or `` dissipative '' part , and a hall current which is always perpendicular to the local field @xmath2 . in previous work , @xcite we considered a model where the functional form of the dissipative current could vary from one place to another in the sample , due to small inhomogeneities in the doping density , or due to other sources of disorder .",
    "however , we assumed the hall current to be governed by a linear ( in field @xmath2 ) hall conductivity , which we took to be uniform throughout the sample . in this case",
    ", we were able to derive a lyapunov functional , whose value can only decrease in time , for a system with specified electrochemical potential at the boundaries .",
    "then the system must eventually reach a static state , whose potential configuration is at least a local minimum of the lyapunov functional , so that oscillatory or chaotic time - dependent solutions are not possible as a steady state .    if we allow the hall conductivity to vary from one place to another , however , it is generally not possible to find a lyapunov functional for the system . in this case , there is no minimization principle to determine the long - time behavior , and there is no guarantee that a stable time - independent solution exists .",
    "in fact , we shall explore explicitly some simple geometries where , for certain ranges of parameters , the long - time behavior is time - dependent .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss the phenomenological relation between the dissipative current and the local field , provide a brief overview of the lyapunov functional formalism , then use the local capacitance model to arrive at a continuity equation that can be solved for the position - dependent electrochemical potential .",

    "a discussion of some alternative assumptions for the lyapunov function , and their consequences for the relative costs of different domain - wall configurations , is given in an appendix .",

    "( [ eq : curr ] ) implements an ultraviolet cutoff , which will lead to a finite domain wall thickness , proportional to the square - root of the parameter @xmath15 , which will be taken to be small compared to the size of typical domain ( indeed , this is almost a matter of definition of domains phase ) . in practice",
    ", we expect that the domain wall thickness will be of the order of the cyclotron radius @xmath16 , which is of order 1 @xmath17 in typical samples where zrs is observed .",
    "the vector function @xmath12 may also depend explicitly on the position @xmath18 , due to inhomogeneities in the 2deg , and its direction may not be perfectly aligned with @xmath2 . in previous work",
    ", we considered explicitly the effects of inhomogeneities in @xmath12 arising from gradients in the equilibrium electrostatic potential @xmath19 due to disorder . in the present paper , however , we shall ignore this complication , and shall assume that the function @xmath12 has no explicit dependence on @xmath18 , except for a brief discussion at the end .",
    "( [ eq : curr ] ) will be supplemented by the continuity equation , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the charge density .",

    "consequently , the solution @xmath10 is independent of @xmath11 and we may , for simplicity set @xmath27 . to recover the hall current",
    ", one simply inserts the resulting solution for @xmath2 into the second term in ( [ eq : curr ] ) , at the end of the calculation .",

    "in general , @xmath31 may have multiple minima .",
    "any initial choice of @xmath10 will relax to some local minimum of @xmath31 , though not necessarily the `` ground state '' with lowest @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless , one might expect that in the presence of noise , the system might tend to escape from high - lying minima and wind up in a state with @xmath31 close to the absolute minimum .",
    "we shall assume here that the function @xmath33 depends only on the norm squared @xmath34 of the electric field , as would be appropriate in the limit of a uniform isotropic electron system , assuming that there is no unique axis picked out by external factors such as the polarization of the microwave field . by hypothesis , under conditions where zrs occurs",

    "sec : experimental - prospects ] for estimates ) .",
    "when @xmath35 , the dissipative current , @xmath38 , will vanish , and @xmath39 .    in the following calculations , for reasons of simplicity , and also to avoid introduction of additional parameters , we shall assume that eq .",

    "if a nearby conducting plane is absent , the local capacitance model will not be strictly correct , but we would expect to obtain qualitatively correct results by using ( [ eq : vcrho ] ) , replacing the setback distance @xmath48 by a characteristic domain size .",
    "we shall assume that the hall conductance at point @xmath18 is determined in the usual way by the charge density @xmath21 at that point : @xmath51 variations in the hall conductance due to variations in @xmath44 will be crucial for the effects we investigate below .",
    "on the other hand , variations in @xmath11 due to variations in @xmath46 play no role in the dynamics when one assumes a local capacitance , as in eq .",

    "the contribution of this term to @xmath52 is parallel to @xmath53 , and , therefore , gives no contribution to the divergence of the hall current .",
    "hence , we shall neglect this contribution and write the hall conductance as @xmath54 which is a quantity fixed at the outset , independent of the non - equilibrium charge - density induced by the microwave radiation .",
    "we finally note that the lyapunov functional of eq .",
    "[ eq : g - def ] misses one important piece of physics ",
    "while it incorporates the fact that there is a high penalty for the field to change on length scales shorter than the domain wall thickness @xmath55 , it neglects the fact that , at least in the local capacitance model , the domains can not be arbitrarily big . more precisely , if we imagine drawing lines through the domain that are parallel to the field inside of it , then these line segments inside the domain can not get too long .",
    "otherwise , the induced voltage difference between points at opposite ends of these lines would result in an induced charge density @xmath56 that alters the total electronic charge density by a large amount , which should be taken into account in the functional form of the lyapunov function @xmath57 .",

    "note that the maximum domain size will tend to be largest if the setback distance @xmath48 of the screening gate is large , so that the capacitance per unit area is small .      in our calculations",

    "the interactions between the walls will most likely break this continuum down to a finite set of states , but such investigation lies outside the scope of this paper .",
    "it should be emphasized that the existence of non - equivalent degenerate solutions in the case of @xmath90 , and the multiple degenerate solutions for @xmath94 are a peculiar feature of the quartic lyaponuv function ( [ eq : gquad ] ) that we have assumed in our analysis . in this case",
    "the lyapunov energy per unit length of a domain wall with field - angle @xmath95 is smaller than that of a domain wall with @xmath96 by precisely a factor of @xmath97 , just compensating for the difference in total domain - wall length in the two solutions .",

    "the question of whether the states other than the one with a single horizontal wall would be present in an actual sample is hard to answer definitively . given a random initial configuration for @xmath10 , whether time evolution would take it to a state having diagonal walls is a matter of the relatives size of the domains of attraction for the such states compared with the domain of attraction for the state with one horizontal wall .",
    "time - evolving the continuity equation above numerically ( more details on the numerics are provided later in the paper ) , we found that , for @xmath106 , starting with a random initial guess for the electrostatic potential , it is very likely that we end up in the state with diagonal walls .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above , if we were to assume a more realistic form for the lyapunov function @xmath33 than the quartic form ( [ eq : gquad ] ) , we believe that solutions with diagonal domain walls would most likely have lower lyapunov energies than the solution with a single straight wall , in which case their basins of attractions would presumably be further enlarged .",
    "we may also consider the situation where there is a voltage difference @xmath107 between the top and bottom edges of the system .",
    "as long as @xmath107 is small compared to @xmath108 , the voltage can be accommodated by small displacements of the domain walls , giving a non - zero average of @xmath109 , without producing a net current in the @xmath110-direction .",
    "this can occur for the moving domains that we find when @xmath11 depends linearly on @xmath110 in the same manner as for the stationary solutions appropriate to constant @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the property of zero dc conductance , as measured in the corbino geometry , is preserved for the time - dependent solutions .",
    "while not as readily experimentally relevant as nonstationary states in a corbino setup , it is nonetheless instructive to consider the kinds of nonstationary states we can get on a torus .",
    "we believe that the results might be applicable to cases where equilibrium density has correlation length that is much smaller than the sample size , and that , in such cases , one might get away with modeling a smaller piece of sample with periodic boundary conditions , rather than all of it with corbino or hall - bar boundary conditions .",

    "however , the numerical evidence cited above at the very least seems to suggest that , as we decrease @xmath137 the basin of attraction for the two - wall solution rapidly shrinks .",
    "we will demonstrate below that , below some @xmath138 the two wall solution becomes unstable .",
    "as we have no analytic solution to the full - blown nonlinear partial - differential equation , the technique of choice will be to linearize the differential equation satisfied by the potential around the two - wall equilibrium and see whether the eigenmodes grow or decay with time for various values of @xmath114 and domain wall thickness @xmath70 .",

    "we will then try to understand what happens when both of the parameters are nonzero .",
    "linearizing around the two - wall solution , we see that changing the field by @xmath139 changes the longitudinal current by    @xmath140 here , @xmath141 is the field corresponding to the solution with two horizontal walls . for the quartic lyapunov density ,",
    "the form of @xmath141 is derved in the appendix for the case of a single domain wall .",

    "we first consider the case of uniform hall conductivity but nonzero domain - wall thickness .",
    "equation ( [ eq : eigenmode ] ) now turns into    @xmath151    the regions immediately surrounding the domain wall and the regions far away from it should be considered separately , turning this problem into a wkb - type computation .",

    "the equation is separately solved in each region , then different solutions are patched at various boundaries .",
    "we will assume a power series expansion for eigenvalue @xmath155 and eigenfunction @xmath156 : @xmath157 .",

    "there are four cases to consider , and we will first briefly mention those two where the solution is antisymmetric under the reflection through domains midpoints . going order by order in the expansion , one can show that all contributions are identically zero .",
    "we now turn to the more interesting case of midpoint - symmetric solutions .",
    "solving for @xmath161 s in the bulk and in the boundary layers , and matching these solutions yields the terms in the eigenvalues expansion .",
    "we note that since @xmath161 in the boundary layers are most conveniently written as function of @xmath162 , the matching conditions would be @xmath163 assuming the quartic form ( eq .

    "for relatively small @xmath169 , though , @xmath170 .",
    "in particular , considering @xmath171 , time evolution of the eigenmode ( see lower right panel of fig . [",

    "the zeroth order term is negative , thus causing both eigenvalues to be negative for thin enough domain walls .",
    "this implies that the solution with two horizontal walls would be locally stable in the corbino geometry .      in the limit of zero domain wall thickness , @xmath174 everywhere but on the domain walls , where @xmath175 diverges .",
    "setting @xmath173 in eq .",
    "[ eq : eigenmode ] must then be accompanied by the prescription of how to deal with @xmath156 on the domain walls .",
    "this is not a straightforward task .",
    "instead , we shall take a stab by _ assuming _ a simple boundary condition , namely that @xmath176 as one approaches the domain walls .",
    "this boundary condition will suffice to determine the eigenvalues , as ( [ eq : eigenmode ] ) is now simplified , away from the domain walls , to a second order differential equation , @xmath177 ( since the positions of domain walls are fixed , we have introduced an offset parameter @xmath178 to study the general case where the domain wall is not necessarily located at an extremum of @xmath11 . )    we shall be interested in understanding the behavior of eigenvalue @xmath179 for small @xmath114 ; in particular , we will be interested in the most physically relevant eigenvalue , with the largest ( most positive ) real part , as @xmath180 , @xmath181 .",

    "one readily sees that real part of eigenvalue ( and eigenfunction ) only contains even powers of @xmath114 , while the imaginary part has only odd powers .",
    "starting with @xmath185 and @xmath186 , we can get @xmath187 by integrating twice the differential equation it obeys , @xmath188 the assumed boundary condition , @xmath189 , then fixes @xmath190 . in a similar manner , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and higher order terms in the expansion can be obtained .",
    "the first few terms in the eigenvalues expansion are as follows : @xmath193 the next term in the expansion would not be given explicitly here , but we find it useful to give numerical values of the @xmath194 here : in the case of @xmath195 , one finds @xmath196 .",
    "we also find that the first two terms in the expansion of real part of @xmath155 , @xmath197 for all @xmath178 and for @xmath114 smaller than about 8.36 .",
    "we finally comment that making shift @xmath198 is equivalent to moving from one domain to the other .",
    "this leaves the real part of eigenvalue unchanged while flipping the sign of the imaginary part .",
    "it follows that eigenvalues come in conjugate pairs , and that corresponding eigenfunctions must identically vanish in one of the domains .",
    "this last result , of course , is a consequence of our assumption that @xmath199 at the domain walls , but it is reminiscent of the type iii periodic solutions in our numerical results , where charge is moving in one directions in one of the domains , and in the opposite direction in the other domain . in this light",
    ", it is not at all surprising that the solutions of this kind show up at fairly large @xmath114 , where the fact that the domain wall thickness is actually nonzero is not qualitatively important .",
    "this gives us reassurance that setting @xmath200 on domain walls was a reasonable guess .",
    "we are now ready to address the case where the hall conductivity is nonuniform and the domain walls have nonzero thickness .",
    "we restrict the analysis to the cases where @xmath114 is at most @xmath202 and we consider the mode with the lowest @xmath169 , @xmath171 .",
    "the analysis of the previous subsection then implies that , for @xmath203 , we might expect @xmath204 .",
    "the eigenmode then is a decaying one , and we find that the solution with two horizontal walls is stable . below some @xmath205 ( which is a function of @xmath113 and @xmath70 ) , however , the mode will start growing , and we find that putting ( just about any ) perturbation on top of the two - wall solution and time - evolving the resulting guess would take us away from it . indeed , for @xmath206 , we expect @xmath207 ( see eq .",

    "we expect them to be mostly symmetric between two domains for @xmath213 .",
    "if our guess for the boundary conditions in the previous subsection were a reasonable one , we would expect the modes to have support in one of the domains only for @xmath203 .",
    "the continuity equation was discretized on a triangular lattice of grid points and then evolved in time . for the linear analysis part , the initial guess consisted of a two - wall solution with perturbation that only had one fourier component in the direction parallel to the walls ( along x ) .",

    "working with the rougher mesh has restricted us to domain wall thicknesses @xmath70 no smaller than about .03 .",
    "we first comment on the solutions and then on the eigenvalues .",

    "it is noteworthy that not only is the agreement excellent in the linear regime but even by the time we get to the saturated regime , the agreement is still very good .",
    "indeed , it was the this striking linear ( in @xmath114 ) behavior exhibited by the full nonlinear solutions that has motivated the whole expansion enterprise .",
    "we have seen that non - uniformities in the hall conductance @xmath11 , produced by inhomogeneities in the equilibrium electron density , can lead , under certain circumstances , to time - dependent domain patterns in the microwave - induced zero - resistance states seen in 2degs .",

    "density variations of the latter type could be created by applying voltages to one or more gates , located at appropriate distances from the sample .    in our calculations , we have studied explicitly two simple models : a corbino - type geometry , with a linear dependence of @xmath11 on the distance @xmath110 form one edge of the sample ; and a model with periodic boundary conditions and a variation in @xmath11 that has a sinusoidal dependence on one of the coordinates . in both cases ,",

    "we speculate that similar time - varying solutions may occur in the random system , with some regions of the sample trying to generate time - dependent solutions of varying frequencies , and other regions favoring decay to a time - independent solution .",
    "if a time - dependent solution occurs in a macroscopic disordered sample , presumably the power spectrum of the dynamic potential fluctuations will contain many frequencies , and the domain - wall motion will be chaotic . since our starting equations are only valid on a length scale greater than the cyclotron radius , of order 1 @xmath227 m , we would not want to consider intrinsic density fluctuations on the scale of the set - back distance , but would restrict ourselves to longer wavelength fluctuations of an extrinsic origin .    the corbino model studied in section [ sec",

    "the density gradient could be be produced by applying a voltage @xmath228 to a front gate , whose distance @xmath229 from the 2deg varied linearly with the radial coordinate @xmath230 .",
    "if @xmath231 is the dielectric constant of the spacer between the gate and the 2deg , then the imposed variation in the equilibrium electron density would be given by @xmath232 where @xmath59 is the mean charge density at @xmath233 .",
    "for example , if @xmath229 were to vary between 1 @xmath227 m and 2 @xmath227 m , from the inner radius to the outer radius of the annulus , and if @xmath234 , one would need a gate voltage @xmath235 to produce a density difference of @xmath236 across the sample , which would be 1% of the average density for the sample studied in ref . .",
    "the gate , as well as the spacer layer , should be transparent to the incident microwaves ; this might be achieved , for example , if the gate is made from a thin film with high resistivity .",
    "alternatively , the density gradient in a 2deg could be created , even if the spacer thickness is uniform by depositing several separately - contacted gates on top of the spacer and putting different voltages on them .",
    "we can use the above numbers to estimate the characteristic frequency of the charge oscillations that might be observed .",

    "figure [ fig : domainenergy ] shows the lyapunov cost per unit length of a domain wall as a function of angle @xmath79 , normalized by its value at @xmath96 , for quartic lyapunov density @xmath274 , as well as for @xmath289 ( used in refs . ) and @xmath290 which gives @xmath291 .",
    "two points need to be made .",

    "[ sec : uniform - hall - conductance ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : domainenergy ] demonstrates that more realistic forms of lyapunov density would break the degeneracy between having a single horizontal domain wall and a couple of diagonal ones , with diagonal walls ( corresponding to @xmath98 domains ) being preferred at least in these examples . that , of course , is helpful , because it is the time evolution of @xmath98 walls that produces dynamics .",
    "the second point is that the energy cost of very small angle domain walls is actually universal , independent of the the precise form of @xmath57 , if @xmath1 and @xmath37 are specified . indeed , if the angle @xmath295 , then even the smallest value that @xmath296 attains , @xmath297 , is very close to 1 .",
    "but , by construction , all @xmath57 look alike in the neighborhood of @xmath35 .",
    "hence , the energy penalty for a small angle domain wall is given by ( [ eq : gdw ] ) , irrespective of form of @xmath57 .",
