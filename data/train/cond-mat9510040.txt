    "the development of clever fabrication techniques in semiconductors has brought the reduction of the effective dimension of electronic states from their usual three - dimensional character in bulk materials , to `` zero - dimensional '' states in quantum dots.@xcite the quantum effects of these lower - dimensional systems have attracted much attention in recent years , due in part to possible applications which include electronic devices based on parallel and perpendicular transport , quantum well lasers , and optical devices .",
    "@xcite two - dimensional quantum - well or quantum - film structures , which provide confinement in one space dimension , have been well investigated , and quantum exciton effects observable even at room temperature have been studied.@xcite the confinement of excitons has also been shown to result in very large electro - optical shifts of the absorption peaks , producing the so - called quantum - confined stark effect.@xcite    in quasi - zero - dimensional quantum dot systems , the additional quantum confinement dramatically changes the optical and electronic properties , compared to those in higher - dimensional structures , as the whole single - particle spectrum is now discrete . correspondingly , the excitonic spectrum is expected to be strongly affected .",
    "the properties of excitons confined in quantum boxes were first analyzed theoretically by bryant,@xcite who used variational and configuration - interaction representations .",
    "later on , excitons and biexcitons have been studied , @xcite as well as excitons in the presence of a strong magnetic field,@xcite using numerical matrix diagonalization schemes .    on the experimental side ,",
    "interband optical spectroscopies , such as photoluminescence , have been used to study various quantum dot systems  such as those produced in the gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as structure , with its bandgap modulation.@xcite more recently , fascinating studies on so - called `` self - assembled '' quantum dots , such as inas and in@xmath0ga@xmath1as clusters on gaas substrates , have also been reported.@xcite most of the theoretical investigations are based on the assumption that the shape of quantum dots is a simple sphere or box , having a great deal of symmetry , both because it simplifies calculations and because quantities such as the exciton binding energy scale very well with the overall dot size . however , realistic dot shapes are probably much less symmetrical , as well as being typically flat and more two - dimensional in shape.@xcite    here , we consider the effect that less symmetric structures , namely flat quantum dots with elliptical cross sections , or `` elliptical quantum disks '' , have on the excitonic optical properties . to date , little work has been reported on the properties of nonsymmetric quantum dots , probably because this system has more complicated solutions.@xcite our studies within the effective mass approximation yield some very interesting consequences of the elliptical asymmetry : apart from the expected blue shift of the first excitonic transition for dots with the same overall area but different axes , we find a rearrangement of the oscillator strength which characterizes individual dot shapes . in particular , since elliptical cross - section dots have less symmetry , some of the accidental degeneracies in circular dots giving rise to stronger and fewer peaks in the imaginary part of the optical susceptibility are split .",
    "this gives rise to a more monotonically decreasing peak intensity for higher energy features in the susceptibility of noncircular dots .",
    "this behavior can in turn be used to structurally characterize specific dots from their photoluminescence excitation response .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the theoretical method in sec .",
    ", we outline the effective mass hamiltonian approach and introduce the various basis function representations which allow us to use numerical methods to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of excitons in these quantum dots",
    ". a great deal of care is needed to assure that the solutions obtained are well behaved and converged with a finite computational effort .",
    "we discuss in this section how this is accomplished . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the main geometrical effects on various exciton characteristics , such as the exciton binding energy , electron - hole separation , and the linear optical susceptibility .",
    "solutions for excitons in quantum dots with both circular and elliptical cross sections are shown , using large enough basis sets , and a set of optimized basis functions , which improve the accuracy of the solutions at a modest computational cost . finally , we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "the appendix contains an outline of the derivation of the coulomb matrix element with these basis functions .",
    "the analytical expression presented there greatly simplifies our calculations .",
    "for concreteness , and to simulate recent quantum dot systems,@xcite we assume quantum dots with an oblate spheroidal profile where the lateral @xmath2 confinement is much weaker ( or larger size ) than that along the @xmath3 direction .",
    "correspondingly , the electrons and holes are assumed confined in an effectively two - dimensional potential with a constant @xmath3 profile , @xmath4 .",
    "we assume @xmath4 to be a hard - wall confinement potential , so that the @xmath3 component of the energy is @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "further , we approximate the single @xmath3 wavefunction in the problem as a @xmath7 function centered at the origin , so that the problem can be described by a separable hamiltonian in two dimensions . the lateral confinement is modeled via harmonic potentials with two different frequencies @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which yield the elliptical cross section of the dots with axes ratio given by @xmath10 , for both electrons and holes .",
    "the smoothly varying potential should mimic well the situation in experiments where the dots are effectively embedded in a dielectric matrix.@xcite    the effective - mass parabolic - band hamiltonian for an electron - hole pair is given by @xmath11 , where the subscripts @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent electron and hole , and @xmath14 with a similar expression for the hamiltonian of the hole , @xmath15.@xcite the coulomb interaction between electron and hole is screened by a background dielectric constant @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian into relative and center of mass coordinates , described by @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the total and reduced masses are given by @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the total hamiltonian of this system can then be written in the form @xmath22 , with the expected expressions @xmath23 and @xmath24 the hamiltonian of the center of mass is obviously a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator in the @xmath25 plane , with wavefunction @xmath26 , and energy @xmath27 , where @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 here , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are quantum numbers for the center of mass coordinate , and @xmath33 is a hermite polynomial.@xcite    the physics of the problem is determined to a great extent by the ratio between the effective bohr radius , @xmath34 , and the size of the dot , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "the strong confinement limit for @xmath37 is characterized by a weak electron - hole correlation and by the coulomb term being a small perturbation of the single - particle confined - level energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the weak - confinement limit for @xmath38 reduces asymptotically to the problem of a free two - dimensional exciton for large @xmath39 , where the coulomb interaction dominates the state of the exciton @xcite .    with this in mind ,",
    "the effects of the coulomb term @xmath40 in @xmath41 , are treated by using the solutions of @xmath42 as the basis set in the diagonalization of @xmath43 .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian of the relative coordinate @xmath42 is also a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator , so that the wavefunction of the interacting electron - hole pair is described by a linear combination of wavefunctions , @xmath44 , with the @xmath45 s satisfying a similar expression to eq .",

    "( notice @xmath3 confinement length for this coordinate is @xmath49 . )    with this basis set , the interaction matrix elements of the electron - hole pair can be calculated analytically and expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions as outlined in the appendix .",
    "this analytical expression greatly simplifies the calculation , as most of the computational time is spent on the calculation of the matrix elements rather than on the diagonalization of the matrix .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian matrix is real , symmetric , and sparse .",
    "the energies and eigenfunctions are calculated from the numerical diagonalization of the matrix , for a given size of the basis .",
    "the diagonalization is repeated with larger basis sets until the desired convergence is achieved ( see below ) .",
    "as an additional test of our numerical procedures we use the resulting radial equation of the relative hamiltonian for the circular dot case , @xmath50 , which is then given by @xmath51 the resulting one - dimensional equation can be directly integrated numerically , as reported by que.@xcite furthermore , the problem can also be solved using a harmonic basis set of radial states as those described above . for a large enough basis set",
    ", this approach yields the same results as those obtained by direct numerical integration.@xcite notice also that the large dot limit @xmath52 is easily solved as an expansion in terms of the laguerre polynomial - based solutions of the free exciton problem.@xcite this allows one to obtain very accurate solutions for @xmath53 with little computation .",
    "these results , moreover , allow us to test the convergence of the irreducible two - dimensional nonsymmetric problem @xmath54 , as we discuss below .",
    "solutions for these elliptic cylinderlike quantum dots are also carried out using an optimized basis set , as the solution method discussed above requires a rather large number of states for full convergence , especially for large dots . here",
    ", one notices that for large dots it is the coulomb interaction that dominates the exciton states ( since confinement becomes less important ) .",
    "correspondingly , we choose a set of optimized frequencies , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which are larger than the original frequencies , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the values of the @xmath59 s are determined variationally , and allow one to consider @xmath60-matrix systems that are much smaller than those required when one uses the @xmath61 basis .",
    "the physical reason for this is that as the dot size increases , the exciton size converges to @xmath62 ( the radius of the free two - dimensional exciton ) , and one needs a large number of @xmath61 states to describe the small - scale structure of the exciton .",
    "notice that the harmonic @xmath59 basis allows also an easy calculation of the @xmath60-matrix elements in this case , so that for example , @xmath63 \\ , \\delta{_{n{_{x^\\prime}},n{_x } } } \\ , \\delta_{n_{y^\\prime},n_{y } } \\nonumber \\\\    & & - \\ , \\frac{\\hbar}{4\\omega{_x}}(\\omega_x^2- \\omega_x^2 ) \\left [ \\sqrt{n_x(n{_x}-1 ) } \\ , \\delta{_{n{_{x^\\prime}},n{_x}-2 } } + \\sqrt{(n_x+1)(n{_x}+2 ) } \\ , \\delta{_{n{_x^{\\prime}},n{_x}+2 } } \\right ]   \\ , \\delta{_{n_{y^\\prime},n_y } }    \\nonumber \\\\    & & - \\ , \\frac{\\hbar}{4\\omega{_y}}(\\omega_y^2-\\omega_y^2 ) \\left [ \\sqrt{n_y(n{_y}-1 ) } \\ , \\delta{_{n{_{y^\\prime}},n_y-2 } } + \\sqrt{(n_y+1)(n{_y}+2 ) } \\ , \\delta{_{n{{_{y^{\\prime}}}},n{_y}+2 } } \\right ] \\ , \\delta{_{n{{_{x^\\prime}}},n{_x } } }   \\,\\ ,   .",

    "this expression allows one to evaluate the hamiltonian matrix rather conveniently , even for this other basis set .",
    "the wavefunctions of the relative coordinate problem can then be written as @xmath65 , with either the @xmath61 or @xmath59 basis states , which can be used to study various characteristic properties of the exciton system .",
    "for example , the mean electron - hole separation @xmath66 , is given by @xmath67     & & +   \\ , \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\hbar}{{\\mu}\\omega{_y}}\\left[\\sqrt{(n{_y}+2)(n{_y}+1 ) }   \\ , a{{^*}{_{n{_x},n{_y}+2 } } } + \\sqrt{n{_y}(n{_y}-1 ) }   \\ , a{{^*}{_{n{_x},n{_y}-2}}}\\right]a{_{n{{_x}},n{{_y } } } } \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\ , \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\hbar}{{\\mu}\\omega{_x}}\\left[\\sqrt{(n{_x}+2)(n{_x}+1 ) }    \\ , a{{^*}{_{n{_x}+2,n{_y } } } } + \\sqrt{n{_x}(n{_x}-1 ) }    \\ , a{{^*}{_{n{_x}-2,n{_y}}}}\\right]a{_{n{{_x}},n{{_y } } } } \\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives an idea of the exciton size .",
    "one can also use the diagonalization results to calculate directly measurable properties , such as the linear optical susceptibility of the quantum dot / disk .",
    "the linear optical susceptibility is proportional to the dipole matrix elements between one electron - hole pair j state and the vacuum state , @xmath68.@xcite these in turn are proportional to the interband matrix element , @xmath69,@xcite which is the matrix element formed between an electron and hole in the conduction and valence bands , respectively .",

    "] ] the linear optical susceptibility can then be calculated from @xmath77 where @xmath78 is introduced as a phenomenological level broadening constant .",
    "notice also that since experimental systems are typically configured to analyze a large collection of nearby dots , one should in principle be concerned by the effect of local fields .",
    "however , in typical experimental systems so far , where the separation between dots can be several microns , it is valid to assume that dots are basically independent . in the case of higher - dot densities , however , the dynamical response of the system may be affected by the local fields produced by neighboring dots , and one can obtain that response from the individual microscopic polarizabilities.@xcite",
    "as an interesting example of a typical system , we use parameters to describe gaas quantum dots , so that the dielectric constant is @xmath79 , and the carrier masses are @xmath80 , and ( the heavy hole effective mass ) @xmath81.@xcite we present the numerical results for heavy - hole excitons in gaas quantum dots with elliptical and circular cross sections .",

    "the transition between the strong and weak confinement regimes comes appropriately when the size of the quantum dot is near the effective bohr radius , @xmath92 nm . notice that it is for @xmath93 nm that the @xmath94 curve ( dashed ) departs from the exact result ( solid line ) , and that one requires larger @xmath95 values as @xmath39 increases to achieve better convergence .",
    "the @xmath96 basis set ( dot - dashed curve ) yields the convergent solutions with acceptable accuracy and execution time for a larger range of @xmath39 values ( @xmath97 nm ) .",
    "similar behavior can be seen in the electron - hole separation in the ground state [ inset in panel ( b ) ] .",
    "the inset in 1(a ) also shows the difference between the @xmath61 basis and @xmath59 basis results .",

    "for dot sizes @xmath103 nm and larger , the optimized frequency @xmath59 converges to 80 mev , corresponding to a dot size @xmath104 nm . this latter value is close to the two - dimensional effective bohr radius ( @xmath105 nm ) , as one would expect .",
    "notice that for most of the range of @xmath39 s shown , one is in the weak - confinement regime , where @xmath106 .",
    "this is why the optimized basis set gives very reasonable results with minimal effort .",
    "it is also interesting that the agreement continues also for smaller dot sizes , completing the range from @xmath107 to @xmath108 nm .",
    "the exciton ground state binding energies and the normalized electron - hole separation obtained with the optimized @xmath59 basis approach are basically exact to the fully converged results .    the main panels in fig .  1 ( a ) and ( b ) show the geometrical confinement effects of excitons with several different size axis ratios in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "the plots show results versus @xmath109 , the effective size of the dot , for @xmath110/@xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 ( @xmath114 , @xmath107 , and @xmath115 ) with diamonds , pluses , and triangles , respectively .",
    "the exciton binding energy increases for a small @xmath39 as the axis ratio is increased ; meanwhile , the normalized electron - hole separation is basically unchanged , except for small @xmath39 values , where the confinement energy dominates . notice that as the axis ratio increases , the single - particle and exciton states move up in energy but the _ binding _ energy increases .",
    "this increase in binding energy for the elliptical dots is then related to the increase of the coulomb energy _",
    "relative _ to the confinement contribution to the total energy .",
    "( in fact , since @xmath116 is basically unchanged with geometry , the coulomb interaction energy is nearly constant in all these cases . )    to better explore the geometrical confinement effects on excitons , we show the linear optical susceptibility of the gaas quantum disks with elliptical cross sections and lateral mean size of @xmath117 nm ( fig .  2 ) , and 10 nm ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the dot thickness along the @xmath3- direction is kept constant at @xmath118 nm , and several size ratios for each axis in the @xmath2 plane are shown .",
    "we use here also a value for the optical bandgap of @xmath119 ev . the results presented here were obtained using the optimized @xmath59 basis set approach discussed above . notice",
    "that since this function represents all of the possible transitions of this excitonic system , its features would be measurable via photoluminescence excitation measurements .",
    "on the other hand , the photoluminescence response would correspond to the first ( lower energy ) feature in these traces , associated with the ground state of the excitonic system .",
    "figure 2 shows the imaginary part of the linear optical susceptibility as a function of frequency for a dot with @xmath120 nm ( a broadening of @xmath121 mev is used ) .",
    "the bottom trace is for a circular dot , so that @xmath122 nm . the upper two traces show results for elliptical dots with a size ratio @xmath123 ( @xmath124 nm , and @xmath125 nm ) , and @xmath126 ( @xmath127 nm , @xmath128 nm ) , respectively , all having the same mean size @xmath129 nm . [ notice that although the peak heights are in arbitrary units , the ratio between different peaks or traces is real , reflecting the different dipole matrix elements involved . ]   one obvious difference among traces is that the first transition energy shifts to higher values by @xmath130 and 69 mev , as the size ratio changes from 1:1 to 2:1 and 3:1 , respectively .",
    "notice that while increasing the size ratio , the exciton binding energies _ increase _ from 47 mev to 48 and 49 mev for each ratio .",
    "it is then clear that the larger blue shifts are due mostly to the increasing confinement as the disk becomes more elliptical , and not due to the binding energy between electron and hole . in all the cases shown , the transition involving the ground state of the exciton is dominant , as the excited states appear only with smaller oscillator strength .",
    "notice further that for the larger length ratio , the spectrum is understandably sparser , as the levels associated with the narrow dimension are quickly pushed upwards in energy .",
    "finally , since the elliptical dots have lower symmetry , accidental degeneracies are fewer and the transition peaks show nearly monotonically decreasing intensities ( unlike the circular dot case ) .",
    "[ notice these all the susceptibility traces include transitions between different center - of - mass states up to the @xmath131 levels .",
    "additional @xmath132 and @xmath133 values would yield higher energy structure . ]",
    "figure 3 shows also the imaginary part of the susceptibility but for a dot size of 10 nm , and here with level broadening of 1 mev .",
    "the first transition energy in the circular quantum dot is 1.78 ev , while the values in the elliptical dots are 1.79 and 1.80 ev , for ratios @xmath134 and @xmath126 . the transition energies result here to be lower than in fig .  2 since the confinement is not as strong , reducing the effective gap energy .",
    "in this set of curves , the first transition energy ( involving the ground state of the exciton ) is shifted upwards for elliptical dots , due to the increased confinement , although the shift is not as large as in fig .  2 , since the overall lengths are larger .",
    "the first excited state appears split because the two - fold degeneracy of the excited state is broken as the dot becomes elliptical .    as dot size",
    "is increased , it is apparent that the geometrical effects are not as prominent , producing only a small shift of the spectrum of transitions .",
    "incidentally , the onset of transitions for larger size dots ( @xmath135 nm ) compares qualitatively well with experimental photoluminescence spectra in dots with similar disk geometry,@xcite where features appear in the energy range 1.73  1.74 ev , for dots with radius thought to be in the range 150200 nm . according to the experimental results ,",
    "the additional confinements give the observed blue shift , compared to two - dimensional quantum - well exciton case .",
    "similarly , a blue shift appears due to the elliptical shape , although for @xmath135 nm they are only @xmath136 mev , as the size ratio increases to 2:1 and 3:1 .    as an example of the effects for different materials , fig .",
    "4 shows the imaginary part of the susceptibility of inas quantum dots with lateral mean size of @xmath137 nm and thickness of @xmath138 nm  having a dielectric constant @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and heavy hole effective mass @xmath141 .",
    "here , the energy gap is taken as 0.43 ev , and we also use the optimized @xmath59 basis set to obtain the results shown . the convergent optimized size , @xmath142 nm , is close to the two dimensional effective bohr radius ( @xmath143 nm ) . in this case , the first transition energy shifts to higher values by @xmath144 and 28 mev , as the size ratio changes from 1:1 to 2:1 and 3:1 , respectively . notice the similarity with fig .  2 , although the energy scale and size ( 12 nm ) are completely different here .",
    "this similarity is due to the scaling of the problem in terms of @xmath145 .",
    "for these inas parameters , @xmath146 nm , so that @xmath147 , comparable to the value in fig .  2 for gaas , where @xmath148 , @xmath129 , and @xmath149 .",
    "we have demonstrated that strong geometrical confinement effects appear on excitons in gaas and inas quantum dots with elliptical cross sections .",
    "the solutions have been obtained using sufficiently large basis sets as well as with an optimized basis set .",
    "the results obtained with the optimized basis sets , such as exciton binding energy and normalized electron - hole separation , are extremely close to the best converged results , and only with a relatively modest computational effort .",
    "the linear optical susceptibilities are calculated for several different lateral size ratios of each axis ( @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) .",
    "strong blue shifts in the susceptibilities are observed as the size ratio is increased and the shifts due to the geometrical shape effects are especially important for the smaller dot sizes ( @xmath152 nm ) .",
    "the shifts are due mostly to the increasing confinement as the dot becomes more elliptical , and not due to the interaction energy between electron and hole .",
    "a splitting of the first few excited states appears in the elliptical cross section cases since the symmetry - related degeneracy of the excited states in the circular dot is broken .",
