    "hybrid systems composed of plasmonic nanostructures and quantum emitters / absorbers ( e.g. , semiconductor quantum dots or other gain media ) are currently of much interest .",
    "this is due to the plasmonic element s ability to interact strongly with light , leading to subwavelength control and confinement , and the possibility of the quantum element introducing nonlinear optical ( as well as more general quantum ) responses that may be enhanced by its proximity to the plasmonic element .",
    "for example , theoretical predictions of certain fano resonance phenomena  @xcite in such systems exist , and experiments are approaching the ability to measure such features  @xcite and have already demonstrated novel lasing action  @xcite and quantum coherences .  @xcite the studies of such hybrid systems can also be viewed as steps in the emerging field of `` quantum plasmonics , ''  @xcite which aims to realize quantum - controlled devices relevant to quantum sensing , single - photon sources , and nanoscale electronics",
    ".    features relevant to quantum information , such as the entanglement among the quantum dots ( qds ) , can also be achieved in hybrid plasmonic / qd systems .",
    "this ability may seem surprising given the dissipative ( or lossy ) aspect of plasmonic structures .",
    "however , interactions between quantum objects and a dissipative environment lead to the production of stable entangled states .",
    "@xcite several pioneering theoretical studies have shown that dissipation - induced entanglement is relevant to systems of qds interacting with plasmonic nanostructures .",
    "@xcite    we previously explored methods for generating entanglement in qd - plasmon systems , using both systems in which only one qd is initially prepared in its excited state and the system evolves without external excitation and systems in which all the qds are initially in their ground states and the entire system is excited by an ultrafast laser pulse .",
    "@xcite we showed that either a single or repeated optical pulse entangled the qds and that the amount of entanglement can be tuned by controlling the coupling of the qds to the plasmonic nanostructure .",
    "furthermore , the whole system can be excited with a single pulse , without the need to individually address each subsystem .",
    "this work and the present work allow for asymmetric coupling of the qds to the plasmonic system ; for example , one can imagine the qds to be configured to be at different distances from the plasmonic system or in some other way that can lead to asymmetry .    to allow dissipation - induced entanglement to be an effective candidate for quantum information applications",
    ", one must thoroughly understand how the entanglement is generated .",
    "furthermore , constraining parameter sets in experimentally viable regions of the parameter space and knowing the sets associated degrees of entanglement are important for engineering such systems within any larger quantum information platform . in this paper",
    ", we seek to determine system features that maximize the degree of entanglement between the qds . to accomplish this objective ,",
    "we employ analysis based on solutions of limiting forms of the problem and optimization based on numerical solutions to the complete cavity quantum electrodynamics equations .",

    "we also neglect retardation ; hence , our treatment is limited to systems with physical dimensions that are small compared with optical wavelengths .",
    "the lindblad superoperator @xmath20 in describes the dephasing and dissipation effects .",
    "we employ a previously developed  @xcite extension of @xmath21 that is parameterized by the qd population decay @xmath22 , the qd dephasing rate @xmath23 , and the plasmon decay constant @xmath24 .",
    "we consider time scales on the order of the inverse of these rates , so that there are no correlated fluctuations in the qds states and so that the use of the lindblad superoperator is justified .",
    "although environmental dephasing is explicitly included for the qds , it is not necessary to do so for the plasmon because the dephasing that arises from its decay ( encoded in the corresponding term in @xmath21 ) is much larger in magnitude . as in ref .  , the rotating wave approximation is applied .",
    "we use wootter s concurrence  @xcite to measure the entanglement of the system .",

    "one can develop an exact analytical solution for the problem of an arbitrary number of quantum dots interacting with the plasmon if qd dephasing is neglected .",

    "the initial state of relevance to the dark limit calculations is one with an excited qd1 , an unexcited qd2 , and a plasmon ; this state is represented by @xmath46 .",
    "this initial state is interesting because although it is a separable , unentangled state , it is a nonstationary state of the full system that has been shown to evolve into a state with a possibly significant transient degree of entanglement .",

    "in particular , certain rational values of the ratio of the qd - plasmon couplings , @xmath169 , lead to results comparable to the dark case . these ratios can be understood by analyzing the underlying rabi flops of the component qds ; the target final state , after the pulse , consists of one qd excited and the other qd in the ground state . to achieve this",
