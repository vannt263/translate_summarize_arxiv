    "any statistical analysis of real systems is based on the ergodic principle for the microscopic dynamics , that implies the relaxation towards steady states and the independence property of elementary components . even if the existence of microscopic interactions is necessary for the system to evolve toward a statistical equilibrium , in this state any particle moves independently from the others and all the particles are statistically equivalent",
    "( any particle may be representative for the whole ) .",
    "the thermodynamics laws that are derived from a statistical mechanics approach , concern some macroscopic observables of the system , evolving adiabatically with respect the microscopic relaxation time ( i.e. we can consider the whole system in a almost equilibrium state ) , so that the effects of single particle dynamics are conveniently described by means of stochastic processes . as a consequence ,",
    "there should exist a natural separation among macroscopic and microscopic space - time scales .",
    "indeed space and time scales are expected to be strictly correlated : to understand small scale phenomena we need to solve short time scales and viceversa .",
    "nevertheless the statistical mechanics has a great success in describing evolution of macroscopic systems and there is a strong effort to generalize the results for a non - equilibrium thermodynamics and for application to complex systems@xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of social systems have been recently considered under a different point of view due to the possibility of recording large microscopic data sets@xcite .",
    "the main problem is what are the macroscopic effects of cognitive behavior for `` social particles '' .",
    "indeed the cognitive behavior would imply the existence of strong bidirectional interactions among the dynamics at different space and time scales of the system@xcite .",
    "emergence and self - organization characterize the macroscopic states , but the question is which macroscopic observables ( if they exist ) may enrol the complex nature of the system .",
    "these variables may also play an important role in the study of phase transitions and in the control parameters definition .    in italy gps data on individual vehicle paths",
    "are currently recorded for insurance reasons over a sample @xmath0 of the whole private vehicle population@xcite .",
    "this data set gives the opportunity to study the individual mobility demand in urban contexts .",
    "the gps data set contains the geographical coordinates , the time , the instantaneous velocity and the path length of individual trajectories at positions whose relative distance is of order @xmath1 km .",
    "special signals are recorded when the engine is switched on and off .",
    "we remark that the data refer mainly to the private transportation mobility and that , due to privacy legal problems , we do not have any knowledge on the social features of individuals in the sample .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the statistical distributions of the path lengths of individual trajectories , of the activity downtime and the distribution of the monthly activity degree .",
    "our aim is to point out the main macroscopic features of urban mobility studying their correlation with the idea of `` asystematic mobility '' recently proposed by sociologists to explain the observational data in modern metropolis .",
    "we consider gps data recorded during march 2008 in the florence urban area .",
    "we show that some simple assumptions on single particles , like the existence of an `` individual mobility energy '' and of an `` individual mobility time '' that define the daily agenda , may explain the statistical laws emerging from the gps data .",
    "moreover in the equilibrium state individuals seem to minimize their interactions , behaving independently , so that the maximum entropy principle of statistical mechanics can be applied@xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with the idea that the sprawling phenomenon of modern cities implies that citizens move as stochastic particles@xcite .",
    "finally our analysis enlightens some average cognitive properties of individuals in urban mobility .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first section we shortly described the gps data base for vehicle mobility ; in the remaining sections we discuss the three statistical laws on path lengths distribution , on the activities downtime and on the activity degree that are inferred from the data .",
    "a sample of @xmath0 of the private vehicles in italy has a gps system for insurance reason .",
    "any vehicle is associated to an i d number , so that it is possible to follow its mobility during a long time .",
    "each datum gives position , velocity , covered distance from the previous measure and quality of signal .",
    "the data give a sampling of individual trajectories each @xmath2 km , but a signal is also recorded any time the engine is switched on or off .",
    "the data suffer from the gps limited precision , in particular when the gps looses the satellite signal .",
    "these problems are especially relevant at starting points of the trajectories or when vehicles are parked inside a building , and short paths could be strongly affected by these pathologies . when the quality of signal is good the time precision of the recorded data is practically perfect , whereas the space precision is of the order of @xmath3 , usually sufficient to localize a vehicle on the road .",
    "both the instantaneous velocity and the covered space , are given with an adequate precision since they result from a calculation based on gps data recorded each second , but not registered .",
    "we have developed several methods to clean the data from spurious effects in order to avoid passible bias in the sample .    in the present work we consider the gps data in the florence urban area recorded during march 2008 : these data are related to 35,000 vehicles in a circular area of radius @xmath4 km , around the historical center and defining @xmath5 different trajectories .",
    "we have restricted our analysis to the trajectories which start inside a circle of 10 km around the historical town and remain inside the considered area , so that with a good probability we select people living and moving in florence",
    ". then we look for the vehicles which perform daily loops from starting points that we identify as `` home '' : in this case the number of trajectories reduces to @xmath6 . in figure [ figure1 ] we show the considered area where we have plotted the aggregate position gps data : the color refers to the different instantaneous velocities ( red means less than @xmath7 km / h , whereas yellow refers to a velocity in the interval @xmath8 km / h and the green to a velocity @xmath9 km / h )",
    ".    we are completely ignorant on the social composition of the sample and on the specific drivers , but we expect that such individuals perform a mobility related to the activities present in the florence area and have a certain knowledge of the road network .",
    "the activity sprawling that characterizes the modern metropolis has certainly a strong influence on the individual mobility demand@xcite . even if the florence historical center is a very special area full of artistic and tourist attractions , but forbidden to private traffic",
    ", nevertheless we assume the activities randomly distributed in the urban system .",
    "this hypothesis is quite reasonable because we consider a large urban area and our sample is surely composed by inhabitants and not tourists . as a consequence",
    ", we expect that the citizen mobility agenda are influenced by individual features rather than by the city structure . in cities",
    "the stationary average traffic state should emerge as the result of individual interactions of cognitive particles which share the same spatial resources .",
    "in particular we assume that drivers organize their mobility , by applying a minimization strategy of the interactions with other individuals@xcite . in this conceptual framework ,",
    "the mobility can be seen as the realization of many independent individual agenda and the dynamical properties become similar to that of a boltzmann gas . even if it is obviously true that individuals are non - identical particles , path length and activity downtime can be considered common mobility features to all people , and good candidates for a statistical physics approach to describe the stationary state . for each vehicle",
    "we have recorded the total lengths @xmath10 of his daily round trips for the whole considered period .",
    "the length distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] where we point out the existence of an interpolation with a maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath11 with @xmath12 km the characteristic daily path length .",
    "the distribution ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) provides a very good fit of the experimental data , and it can be justified by the maximum entropy principle under the assumption that the individuals are independent particles and that there exists an average daily trip length in the population ( see supplementary material ) . in such a case",
    "the distribution ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) is realized when any particle chooses its mobility energy randomly .",
    "it is straightforward to associate an individual `` mobility energy '' to the daily path lengths .",
    "the assumption that citizens organize their mobility as they own an internal `` mobility energy '' , agrees with similar hypotheses discussed by r.kolb and d.helbing@xcite to explain the daily travel - time distributions for different transport modes .    in order to investigate the concept of the mobility energy together with the maximum entropy principle",
    ", we consider the relation between the daily path length and the single trip path length , building up the rank distribution of individual daily activities .",
    "to define an activity from gps mobility data , we apply a clustering procedure to vehicle stop positions , identifying the positions which lie in a circle of diameter @xmath13 m ( this is considered a acceptable distance between the true destination and the parking place@xcite ) .",
    "moreover we have associated an activity when the elapsed time before the next trip is greater than 15 minutes . in figure [ figure3 ]",
    "we plot the rank distribution for the daily activities together with an exponential interpolation @xmath14 that provides a very good fit of experimental observations .",
    "the equation ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) is consistent with the assumption that , in average , the individuals behave as independent random particles which define their daily agenda in a random way .    according to previous hypotheses , it is possible to compute in analytical way the single trip length distribution , as the distribution realized by uniformly spreading @xmath15 points into a given segment of length @xmath10 . a simple calculation provides the single trip length distribution in the form ( see appendix )",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath17 is a normalizing factor and @xmath18 is the maximum number of daily activities ; we remark that the choice of the points in the segment is contextual without any time - ordering .",
    "it is quite natural to assume that there should exist a correlation between the number of daily activities @xmath18 and the daily mobility length @xmath10 , but the gps data do not suggest any correlation function , so that we decided to use an effective daily length in the theoretical distribution ( [ ( 2.2 ) ] ) to make a comparison with the empirical one .",
    "it turns out that if we exclude the very short paths , the curve ( [ ( 2.2 ) ] ) fits very well with the experimental data ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) with an effective daily mobility length @xmath19 km ( the result is not too sensitive to this particular value and we have not performed any optimization procedure ) .    as a final remark from the figure [ figure4 ]",
    ", we observe that the long trip length distribution differs from an exponential behavior and it rather seems to follow a power law .",
    "time is the second fundamental individual variable of human mobility , directly related to the dynamical realization of daily agenda . from the gps data base in the florence area",
    "we have computed the downtime spent in each daily activity by a fixed individual ; we discard from the activities the sleeping time linked to circadian rhythms . the distribution of the activity downtimes of the recorded individuals is plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , recovering the well known benford s law@xcite .    in order to give a microscopical interpretation of the empirical downtime distribution",
    ", we assume that individuals can not determine a priori each activity downtime , because this is varied depending on unpredictable circumstances . according to this hypothesis , in the average",
    ", each particle has a finite mobility time at disposal to perform the desired activities , and he consumes the time in successive random choices up to the end of the whole mobility time .",
    "if one computes the interval distribution that is obtained by choosing successively @xmath15 points in a given segment , one get analytically the benford s",
    "distribution@xcite @xmath20 shortly , the statistical results of the monthly mobility in the florence area , recorded by the gps data on vehicles , suggest that the macroscopic average properties are the same of those of boltzmann s particles moving in a homogeneous space with an average energy and a finite time at disposal .",
    "the energy introduces a global constraint in the individual daily mobility , whereas the time can be seen as a local constraint in the activity planning since it is consumed step by step .",
    "however computing the distribution of the total activity downtime for the monitored vehicles , we can get an idea of the typology of urban mobility described by our sample .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] we remark the presence of two peaks : one is related to short downtime activities , that probably corresponds to a specific use of the vehicle for a single trip , whereas the second peak centered at @xmath21 h denotes people performing a more complex mobility agenda , which contains the working activities . finally the presence of a long queue for the daily activity downtime ( @xmath22 h ) is probably due to business vehicles in our sample , that are used by different people .",
    "both the boltzmann distribution for the mobility energy and the benford s law for the activity downtime enroll stochastic features of the system , but they do not explain how such features can be related to the individual daily agenda , that are certainly the result of a cognitive behavior . in order to study this question , we perform a statistical analysis of the downtime related to daily activities , considering the monthly degree @xmath15 for the different individual activities ( i.e. the number of times that a citizen repeats a certain activity during a month)@xcite . let @xmath23 the activity downtime , we introduce the join probability @xmath24 to denote the probability of finding a @xmath15-degree activity associated to a downtime @xmath23 .",
    "then by definition we have to recover the benford s law ( [ ( 3.1 ) ] ) by summing over @xmath15 @xmath25 we have also the equality @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the conditional probability for a downtime @xmath23 considering only the @xmath15-degree activities , and @xmath28 is the probability to detect a @xmath15 degree activity ; the factor @xmath15 takes into account the multiplicity of the @xmath15 degree activities .",
    "the study of the conditional probability @xmath27 can shed some light to understand the mobility habits related to the use of private vehicles and to face the question of the relevance of repeated activities both in the mobility and in the use of time .",
    "remarkably the experimental observation suggest the existence of an universal probability distribution @xmath29 for the normalized downtime @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the average downtime for the @xmath15-degree activities .",
    "we read this universal function as the signature of the fact that individuals organize their time , when performing a private car mobility , in a common way independently from the specific activity , i.e. the relative downtime fluctuations are the result of a stochastic universal mechanism . moreover there should exist a common feature among the individuals , concerning how they manage the downtime related to the @xmath15-degree activities , since only the average value @xmath32 characterizes the @xmath15 dependence of the conditional probability @xmath27 .",
    "this universal character could be explained thinking that the @xmath30 variable is a generic `` measure '' of the mobility actions , valid for every individual .",
    "more precisely @xmath30 can be considered the temporal norm for all the mobility related activities . from the empirical data we detect @xmath33 activity downtimes and we have computed the dependence of the average value @xmath32 using the degree @xmath34 .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] that we have an almost linearly increasing behavior of @xmath32 as the degree @xmath15 increases .",
    "this means the existence of a relation between the activity degree and the activity `` use value '' ( individual satisfaction , profit , etc ... ) that introduces an individual tendency to repeat and to spend time in the activities with a relevant added value@xcite .",
    "a possible local interpolation of the empirical data is obtained by using the function ( continuous line in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ) @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in figures",
    "[ figure8],[figure9 ] and [ figure10 ] we plot the empirical probability densities for different degree ( from @xmath38 to @xmath39 ) to investigate the existence of the universal distribution @xmath29 .",
    "there is a decreasing of the data number as @xmath15 increases , but all the distributions are computed with a sample of the same order ( from @xmath40 to @xmath41 ) .",
    "the figures enlighten three different features .",
    "there is a collapse of all the curves on a unique distribution : this is clear in the figure [ figure8 ] ( the tail spread is consistent with statistical fluctuations ) and in the first part of all the plotted distributions that contains the great majority of the data .",
    "all the distributions show a big contribution from the short times activities and a fast decaying tail for large @xmath42 .",
    "there is a smooth rise of a `` signal '' as @xmath15 increases denoted by the appearance of two peaks at @xmath43 : this is clear in the last figure [ figure10 ] .",
    "therefore the empirical observation gives a strong indication for the existence of an universal distribution @xmath29 for the normalized activity downtime , even if when we consider high degree activities ( @xmath44 ) some new features appear but with a small statistical weight .",
    "a possible interpolation of the distribution @xmath29 is given by @xmath45 where the coefficient @xmath46 has a value @xmath47 .",
    "the distribution ( [ univ ] ) is singular at the origin so that the interpolation is certainly approximated at @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure3a ] in the appendix ) .",
    "the exponential decay is the typical boltzmann statistics as for the path length distribution , whereas the @xmath49 behavior is consistent with the benford s law for the downtime distribution . so that this `` universal distribution '' seems to mix both the features shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] and [ figure5 ] . to explain the singular @xmath29 trend at the origin",
    ", we guess that it can be a sign of a strong free - will in the individual behavior in the short time activity range .",
    "surely for a more precise justification further study are required .",
    "we can use the interpolation ( [ univ ] ) to extract the signal from the high degree activity distribution , by computing the ratio between the empirical distribution data and the interpolation ( [ inter ] ) ; in the figure [ figure11 ] we plot the ratio distribution results .",
    "as it can be seen , the empirical data define two peaks centered at @xmath50 hours and at @xmath51 that are common to all the distributions when @xmath52 .",
    "even if these peaks are not statistically relevant , they can be related to individuals that perform repeated activities linked to the canonical working time schedule .",
    "clearly the working time schedule introduces further constrains to the individual mobility agenda , that are not taken into account by the universal distribution @xmath29 .",
    "now the existence of an universal distribution implies ( cfr .",
    "( [ cond ] ) ) @xmath53 then using the interpolation ( [ inter ] ) and performing the change of variable @xmath54 , we obtain that the benford s law ( [ ( 5.1 ) ] ) implies a power law distribution for the activity degrees(see appendix ) @xmath55 according to the estimate ( [ inter ] ) , we expect an exponent @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "[ figure12 ] we plot the empirical activity degree distribution with a numerical interpolation by a power law @xmath57 ; the data provide @xmath58 which is consistent with the analytical estimate ( [ degree ] ) .",
    "the citizens mobility is an interesting social phenomenon that involves a large number of `` intelligent '' elementary components with a free will individual property , so that we can speak of a cognitive dynamics . in this paper",
    "we analyze a lot of car mobility data for the florence area , showing the emergence of three robust statistical laws for the path lengths , the activity downtime and degree .",
    "these laws can be explained as the direct consequence of some simple hypotheses as the particle independence , and above all assuming the existence of an individual mobility energy and of a finite individual time spent for the desired urban activities .",
    "moreover , from the downtime distribution we deduce an universal function which fits with empirical observations and data .",
    "we think that this universal function can be interpreted as an indication of the cognitive time perception common to all human beings , or at least surely common to the car drivers .",
    "finally the urban mobility is clearly complex , but the our steady state statistics can not point out the typical complexity signatures as , for instance , self - organized states . to detect complexity in mobility dynamics , it is necessary to investigate the transients , i.e. the states far from equilibrium .",
