    "dirac surfaces are defined to be conformal immersions from a ( compact ) riemann surface @xmath3 into @xmath4 such that the metric @xmath1 has constant gauian curvature , where @xmath5 is the mean curvature and @xmath6 is the first fundamental form of the surface .",
    "thus dirac surfaces are obtained by spin transformations of a reference surface - an immersed surface of constant gauian and mean curvature in @xmath4- by eigenvectors of the corresponding dirac operator , see equation . for compact and oriented surfaces",
    "the sign of the gauian curvature is already determined by the topology of the surface and there are three cases to consider .",
    "the universal covering of @xmath3 is either a sphere , a plane or the hyperbolic plane . in the case of positive gauian curvature",
    "we get thus dirac spheres which are well understood by now , see @xcite .",
    "the negative gauian curvature case is more difficult to handle since the hyperbolic plane can not be isometrically immersed into @xmath4 by a theorem of hilbert . for vanishing gauian curvature the compact riemann surface",
    "@xmath3 is a torus and the universal covering of @xmath3 is the plane . using the plane as reference surface , i.e.",
    ", the metric @xmath1 is isometric to a constant multiple of the standard metric @xmath7 we get that @xmath8 is constant for dirac tori .",
    "moreover , since the willmore energy is given by @xmath9 , the willmore energy of dirac surfaces with flat metric @xmath1 is uniformly distributed over the surface .",
    "dirac surfaces with a doubly periodic differential can be parametrized using trigonometric functions . in order to obtain a doubly periodic surface",
    "we need to investigate closing conditions .",
    "it turns out that only conformal classes satisfying certain rationality conditions provide dirac tori , see theorem [ dirac ] .    in this paper",
    "we first explain the general setup of spin transformations and how eigenvectors of dirac operator conformally transforms a reference surface .",
    "then we show that the dirac surface property can be translated into an eigenvalue problem and derive the corresponding differential equations .",
    "thereafter , we compute the double periodic spin transformations and compute the closing conditions to obtain closed dirac tori .",
    "further , we determine which conformal classes actually provide dirac tori .",
    "+ the author would like to thank ulrich pinkall for helpful discussions .",
    "let @xmath10 be a conformal immersion from a riemann surface @xmath3 with first fundamental form @xmath6 and mean curvature @xmath5 .",
    "the immersion is called a _ dirac surface _ if @xmath11 is a metric with constant gauian curvature .",
    "the property of being a dirac surface is scale invariant .",
    "further , if @xmath3 is a compact riemann surface , the topology of the surface determines the sign of the gauian curvature of the metric @xmath12    we consider the euclidean @xmath13space as the space of purely imaginary quaternions @xmath14 . in this picture",
    "the quaternionic multiplication coincides with the cross product of @xmath4 and any stretch rotation @xmath15 of @xmath4 is given by @xmath16 for an appropriate @xmath17 and vise versa .",
    "the quaternions @xmath18 can be turned into a complex vector space by choosing the right multiplication with @xmath19 to be the complex structure .",
    "thus we can identify @xmath20 and every @xmath17 can be written as @xmath21 for two complex numbers",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23    let @xmath24 be a quaternionic valued function .",
    "then we consider the @xmath25form @xmath26 on a simply connected domain @xmath27 integrates to a surface @xmath28 if and only if @xmath29 then , following @xcite , we call the map @xmath28 a _ spin transformation _ of @xmath30 . a reformulation of the condition @xmath31 is stated in the lemma below , which can be found in @xcite    [ lemma ] let @xmath32 be a conformal immersion and let @xmath33 the @xmath25form @xmath27 locally integrates to a conformal immersion @xmath28 if and only if there is a real valued function @xmath34 with @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dirac operator of the immersion @xmath37    the exterior derivative of @xmath27 is given by @xmath38 since @xmath30 maps into the space of purely imaginary quaternions , i.e. , @xmath39 we obtain @xmath40 thus @xmath41 if and only if @xmath42 is purely real valued .              for a dirac surface @xmath50",
    "we call the @xmath25form @xmath51 constant , if @xmath52 is a constant function for a constant vector field @xmath53 on @xmath54 with respect to the standard metric .",
    "the mean curvature half density is scale invariant .",
    "further , it measures the local bending of the surface , since for a torus @xmath55 the willmore energy @xmath56 is the @xmath57norm of its mean curvature half density .",
    "let @xmath58 be a conformally immersed surface in @xmath4 with constant gauian curvature and constant mean curvature .",
    "further , let @xmath59 be the induced metric of @xmath58 .",
    "since a dirac surface is characterized by the property that @xmath1 has constant gauian curvature we have @xmath60 for a constant @xmath61 for a conformal map @xmath30 there is always a local spin transformation with @xmath62 thus the corresponding @xmath34 must be constant and we need to solve an eigenvalue problem to obtain dirac surfaces .",
    "we want to specialize in the following to the case where @xmath1 is a flat metric , i.e. , where the universal covering of @xmath3 is a plane .",
    "we can use the @xmath63plane as the reference surface .",
    "the dirac operator of the plane can be easily computed .",
    "let @xmath69 be a quaternionic valued function .",
    "then we can write it as @xmath21 for two complex functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 since @xmath72 and @xmath73 we get @xmath74 the volume form of the plane is given by @xmath75 , hence we obtain the claimed form for the dirac operator .",
    "let @xmath76 be a dirac surface such that @xmath1 is a flat metric .",
    "then @xmath30 is given by a spin transformation of the plane @xmath77 by a spinor field @xmath78 solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath79 more precisely , for @xmath80 where @xmath70 are complex valued functions , we obtain the following system of equations : @xmath81      in order to obtain compact solutions we specialize to surfaces with doubly periodic differentials .",
    "this means that the differential of the surface are defined on the torus @xmath82 for a appropriate lattice @xmath83 complex valued smooth functions on @xmath55 are given by a fourier series @xmath84                  it is worth to note that the differential of a hamiltonian stationary lagrangian torus in @xmath96 , classified in @xcite , satisfies the same system of differential equations as the spinors of dirac tori , which can be seen as follows .",
    "hamiltonian stationary lagrangian tori are critical points of the area functional under variations preserving the lagrangian property .",
    "the right normal of the surface @xmath30 , i.e. , the @xmath97 valued function @xmath98 given by @xmath99 is perpendicular to @xmath19 and is thus of the form @xmath100 further , the function @xmath101 is harmonic . on a torus",
    "we have @xmath102 for a @xmath103 , which we can assume without loss of generality to be @xmath104 .",
    "it can be shown that the differential of a hamiltonian stationary lagrangian torus is given by @xmath105 for a quaternionic function @xmath106 then the closeness of the @xmath25form gives the desired differential equations for @xmath107 .",
    "nevertheless , the closing condition for both surface classes differs .    in order to obtain closed surfaces , i.e. , dirac tori",
    ", we need to consider closing conditions .",
    "a closed periodic @xmath25form on @xmath55 @xmath108 integrates to a periodic function on @xmath109 if and only if @xmath110        the cardinal number of the set @xmath115 , i.e. , the lattice vectors of @xmath116 with @xmath92 , is even since for @xmath117 we have that @xmath118 . if @xmath119 then the only solution to satisfying the closing conditions @xmath120 is the zero function .",
    "if @xmath115 has @xmath121 elements , i.e. , @xmath122 then equation @xmath123 in means that the vector @xmath124 is perpendicular to the vectors @xmath125 and @xmath126 in @xmath127 with respect to the complex linear inner product .",
    "thus @xmath128 if @xmath129 and @xmath130 are linear independent .",
    "but if @xmath131 we obtain that @xmath132 or @xmath132 and @xmath115 has only @xmath133 elements .    in order to meet all conditions , we therefore need @xmath134 .",
    "let @xmath135 we can choose @xmath136 to solve equation @xmath137 .",
    "for all other @xmath117 we choose @xmath138 then equation @xmath139 and @xmath140 reduces to the fact that the vector @xmath141 is perpendicular to the vectors @xmath142 in @xmath143 the space of such vectors @xmath144 is at least a complex @xmath25dimensional .",
    "since the willmore energy is uniformly distributed and @xmath145 , the willmore energy of a dirac torus is given by @xmath146 thus different solutions of to a given eigenvalue @xmath147 and lattice @xmath148 have the same willmore energy .",
    "we first show the statement for @xmath152 let @xmath116 be a lattice with a rectangular sub lattice , then we can assume without loss of generality that this sub lattice is spanned by the vectors @xmath153 for @xmath154 for @xmath155 we have a square lattice and there always exist a non trivial solution .",
    "we want to show that we have at least @xmath156 vectors with the same length in @xmath116 if @xmath157    in this case let @xmath158 with @xmath159 then we can define @xmath160 and @xmath161 and obtain @xmath162 thus there exist at least @xmath156 lattice vectors with length @xmath163 , namely @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "on the other hand if we have @xmath156 elements of @xmath116 with the same length , we can assume that the vectors are given by @xmath166 since these vectors spann a lattice , we get that there are integers @xmath167 and @xmath168 with    @xmath169 and therefore @xmath170 where we used that @xmath171 lie on the unit circle .",
    "thus @xmath172 and there exist @xmath173 with @xmath174 moreover , since @xmath175 we have that @xmath176 and we obtain that @xmath177 and @xmath178 is a rectangular sub lattice of the desired form .",
    "if @xmath179 mod @xmath180 we have that @xmath181 thus a necessary condition for @xmath182 is that @xmath183 has a rectangular sub lattice of the in the stated form .",
    "but then also @xmath116 has such a sub lattice and there is also a dirac torus with @xmath184 for this @xmath116 .",
    "we consider a conformal immersion from @xmath55 to @xmath185 where the lattice @xmath148 is spanned by @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "then the dual lattice @xmath116 is spanned by @xmath177 and @xmath188 .",
    "we choose @xmath189 the smallest possible eigenvalue to obtain a torus is @xmath190 and @xmath115 consists of the vectors @xmath191 then the following choice of coefficients leads to a torus , see figure [ figure ] .",
