    "in this work we are interested in an inverse scattering problem at fixed energy for the helmholtz equation on three - dimensional stckel manifolds satisfying the robertson condition .",
    "the stckel manifolds were introduced in 1891 by stckel in @xcite and are of main interest in the theory of variable separation .",
    "indeed , it is known that the additive separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation for the geodesic flow on a riemannian manifold is equivalent to the fact that the metric is in stckel form . however , to obtain the multiplicative separability of the helmholtz equation , we also have to assume that the robertson condition is satisfied .",
    "as we will see in a brief review of the theory of variable separation , there also exist some intrinsic characterizations of the separability of the hamilton - jacobi and helmholtz equations in terms of killing tensors ( which correspond to hidden symmetries ) or symmetry operators .",
    "we refer to @xcite for important contributions in this domain and to @xcite for surveys on these questions .",
    "we emphasize that the description of the riemannian manifolds given by stckel is local .",
    "we shall obtain a global description of these manifolds by choosing a global stckel system of coordinates and we shall thus use the name of `` stckel manifold '' in our study . we choose to work on a stckel manifold @xmath1 having the topology of a toric cylinder and in order to define the scattering matrix on this manifold ,",
    "we add an asymptotically hyperbolic structure , introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , at the two radial ends of our cylinder .",
    "we can then define the scattering operator @xmath2 at a fixed energy @xmath3 associated with the helmholtz equation on @xmath1 which is the object of main interest of this paper .",
    "the question we address is the following :    _ does the scattering operator @xmath2 at a fixed energy @xmath3 uniquely determine the metric @xmath4 of the stckel manifold ?",
    "_    we recall that inverse scattering problems at fixed energy on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds are closely related to the anisotropic caldern problem on compact riemannian manifolds with boundary .",
    "we refer to the surveys @xcite for the current state of the art on this question .",
    "one of the aim of this paper is thus to give examples of manifolds on which we can solve the inverse scattering problem at fixed energy but do not have one of the particular structures for which the uniqueness for the anisotropic caldern problem on compact manifolds with boundary is known .",
    "note that the result we prove here is an uniqueness result .",
    "we are also interested in stability result i.e. in study the continuity of the application @xmath5 .",
    "this question will be the object of a future work .",
    "the main tool of this paper consists in complexifying the coupled angular momenta that appear in the variable separation procedure .",
    "indeed , thanks to variable separation , the scattering operator at fixed energy can be decomposed onto scattering coefficients indexed by a discrete set of _ two _ angular momenta that correspond to the _ two _ constants of separation . roughly speaking ,",
    "the aim of the complexification of the angular momentum method is the following : from a discrete set of data ( here the equality of the reflection coefficients on the coupled spectrum ) we want to obtain a continuous regime of informations ( here the equality of these functions on @xmath6 ) .",
    "this method consists in three steps .",
    "we first allow the angular momentum to be a complex number .",
    "we then use uniqueness results for functions in certain analytic classes to obtain the equality of the non - physical corresponding data on the complex plane @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we use this new information to solve our inverse problem thanks to the borg - marchenko theorem .",
    "the general idea of considering complex angular momentum originates from a paper of regge ( see @xcite ) as a tool in the analysis of the scattering matrix of schrdinger operators in @xmath8 with spherically symmetric potentials .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for books dealing with this method .",
    "this tool was already used in the field of inverse problems for one angular momentum in @xcite and we note that this method is also used in high energy physics ( see @xcite ) . in this work we use a novel multivariable version of the complexification of the angular momentum method for _ two angular momenta _ which correspond to the constants of separation of the helmholtz equation . note that we have to use this multivariable version since these two angular moments ( which are also coupled eigenvalues of two commuting operators ) are not independent and can not be considered separately .",
    "this work is a continuation of the paper @xcite of daud , kamran and nicoleau in which the authors treat the same question on liouville surfaces which correspond to stckel manifolds in two dimensions .      in this subsection",
    ", we propose a brief review of variable s separation theory .",
    "we refer to @xcite and to the introduction of @xcite for surveys of this theory .",
    "let @xmath1 be a riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath9 .",
    "on @xmath1 , we are first interested in the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a constant parameter and @xmath12 is the gradient operator @xmath13 where we use the einstein summation convention .",
    "we are also interested in the helmholtz equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the covariant derivative with respect to the levi - civita connection .",
    "we note that , as it is shown in @xcite , we can add a potential @xmath18 satisfying suitable conditions to these equations without more complications in the theory we describe here .",
    "it is known that , in many interesting cases , these equations admit local separated solutions of the form @xmath19 for the hamilton - jacobi equation and of the form @xmath20 for the helmholtz equation , where @xmath21 is a suitable coordinate system on @xmath22 and @xmath23 denotes a set of constant parameters , whose number depends on an appropriate definition of separation ( see below ) .",
    "the reason why we are interested in such solutions is that it happens that for solutions of this kind , equations ( [ eqhj])-([eqhel ] ) become equivalent to a system of ordinary differential separated equations , each one involving a single coordinate . in this work",
    "we study the particular case of the orthogonal separation , i.e. when @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "we now recall the definition of separation of variables for the hamilton - jacobi and the helmholtz equations .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation is separable in the coordinates @xmath21 if it admits a complete separated solution , i.e. a solution of the kind @xmath19 depending on @xmath9 parameters @xmath26 satisfying the completeness condition @xmath27    the helmholtz equation is separable in the coordinates @xmath21 if it admits a complete separated solution , i.e. a solution of the form @xmath28 depending on @xmath29 parameters @xmath26 satisfying the completeness condition @xmath30    we now recall the results proved by stckel , robertson and eisenhart at the end of the eighteenth century and at the beginning of the nineteenth century which :    1 .",
    "characterize the riemannian manifolds admitting orthogonal variable separation .",
    "2 .   make the link between the variable separation for hamilton - jacobi and helmholtz equations .",
    "a stckel matrix is a regular @xmath31 matrix @xmath32 whose components @xmath33 are functions depending on the variable corresponding to the line number only .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation is separable in orthogonal coordinates @xmath34 if and only if the metric @xmath4 is of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the minor associated with the coefficient @xmath38 , for all @xmath39 .",

    "thanks to this theorem we see that a full understanding of the separation theory for the helmholtz equation depends on an understanding of the corresponding problem for the hamilton - jacobi equation and we note that the separability of the helmholtz equation is more demanding . the additional condition ( [ condrobintro ] ) in theorem [ thmrob ] is called _",
    "robertson condition_. this condition has a geometrical meaning given by the following characterization dues to eisenhart .",
    "the robertson condition ( [ condrobintro ] ) is satisfied if and only if in the orthogonal coordinates system @xmath34 the ricci tensor is diagonal : @xmath43    we note that the robertson condition is satisfied for einstein manifolds . indeed , an einstein manifold is a riemannian manifold whose ricci tensor is proportional to the metric which is diagonal in the orthogonal case we study .",
    "as shown by eisenhart in @xcite and by kalnins and miller in @xcite the separation of the hamilton - jacobi equation for the geodesic flow is related to the existence of killing tensors of order two ( whose presence highlights the presence of hidden symmetries ) .",
    "we thus follow @xcite in order to study this relation .",
    "we use the natural symplectic structure on the cotangent bundle @xmath44 of the manifold @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath45 be local coordinates on @xmath22 and @xmath46 the associated coordinates on @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the geodesic hamiltonian on @xmath44 .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation can thus be written as @xmath49 thanks to this formalism , an other necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation has been proved by levi - civita .",
    "we state the version given in @xcite .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath50 admits a separated solution if and only if the differential equations , known as the separability equations of levi - civita , @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are identically satisfied .",
    "this theorem gives us a simple method for testing whether a coordinate system is separable or not .",
    "moreover , it also provides us the basis for the geometrical ( i.e. intrinsic ) characterization of the separation .",
    "since we are interested in a characterization of the separation of the hamilton - jacobi equation using killing tensors , we recall here some basic properties of these objects following the second section of @xcite .",
    "we first recall that the contravariant symmetric tensors @xmath54 on @xmath22 are in one - to - one correspondence with the homogeneous polynomials on @xmath44 by the correspondence , @xmath55    the hamiltonian @xmath56 corresponds to the contravariant metric tensor @xmath57 .",

    "we now consider the case of a symmetric @xmath68-tensor @xmath61 .",

    "we denote by @xmath75 the vector field image of @xmath76 by @xmath61 and by @xmath77 the one - form image of @xmath78 by @xmath61 .",
    "in other words , @xmath79 then a @xmath68-tensor @xmath61 gives rise to eigenvalues , eigenvectors or eigenforms according to the equations @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "finally , we denote by @xmath82 the product of the two endomorphisms @xmath83 and @xmath84 whose expression in components is @xmath85 .",

    "the link mentioned in the previous proposition thus states that if the hamilton - jacobi equation is separable , then the corresponding hamiltonian system is completely integrable ( see @xcite ) .    whereas it corresponds a family of @xmath88 killing tensors in involution to every separable system",
    ", there also exist families of killing tensors in involution that are not related to separable systems .",
    "we thus need to find additional conditions to characterize the admissible families of killing tensors .",
    "such conditions are given in the following two theorems .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study an inverse scattering problem at fixed energy on three - dimensional asymptotically hyperbolic stckel manifolds having the topology of toric cylinders and satisfying the robertson condition . on these manifolds </S>",
    "<S> the helmholtz equation can be separated into a system of a radial ode and two angular odes . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus decompose the full scattering operator onto generalized harmonics and the resulting partial scattering matrices consist in a countable set of @xmath0 matrices whose coefficients are the so - called transmission and reflection coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the reflection coefficients are nothing but generalized weyl - titchmarsh functions associated with the radial ode . using a novel multivariable version of the complex angular momentum method </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the knowledge of the scattering operator at a fixed non - zero energy is enough to determine uniquely the metric of the three - dimensional stckel manifold up to natural obstructions .    _ </S>",
