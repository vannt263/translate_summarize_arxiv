    "superconducting qubits are a rapidly advancing part of quantum information science .",
    "the ability to reach deep into the strong coupling regime of cavity qed using microwaves has revolutionized quantum optics in the microwave regime @xcite , and allows the coupling between superconducting qubits and a broad range of microwave frequency quantum systems @xcite . distribution and storage of microwave quantum states , however , present difficult challenges . a way around this problem would be to convert quantum states of microwave photons into optical photons and vice versa .",
    "this would allow long distance propagation of quantum states between superconducting qubit nodes using optical fibres , and it would also allow for quantum memories for light to be used @xcite , which are currently more developed than their microwave counterparts @xcite .",
    "quantum frequency conversion has been achieved between optical frequencies @xcite , and recently between microwave frequencies @xcite .",
    "however , so far , quantum frequency conversion from the microwave to the optical domain remains an unsolved challenge .",
    "there are a number of approaches being investigated for the up - conversion process .",
    "opto - mechanical approaches @xcite currently have the highest reported efficiencies and can achieve mhz bandwidths . in such approaches both an optical and a microwave resonators",
    "are parametrically coupled through a micro - mechanical resonator . in order to have quiet frequency conversion this rather low frequency intermediate mechanical resonator",
    "needs to be cooled to its quantum ground state , and this is currently challenging . another approach is to use conventional non - linear optical materials to make resonantly enhanced modulators @xcite .",
    "two recent proposals @xcite have suggested using rare earth doped solids , with a particular focus on erbium doped yttrium orthosilicate ( er : yso ) .",
    "er : yso has many attractive features for frequency up - conversion : it has narrow inhomogeneous and homogeneous linewidths for its @xmath0 optical transition @xcite , and the wavelength of this transition is in the telecommunications band , where propagation losses in optical fibres are minimized . because er@xmath1 is a kramer s ion ( odd number of @xmath2 electrons ) , for the nuclear spin free isotopes ( all but @xmath3er ) , the ground state is doubly degenerate .",
    "it also has rather large effective @xmath4 values @xcite , such that microwave frequency splittings can be achieved with only modest magnetic fields .",

    "a coherence is produced on the third transition which generates an optical signal field @xmath10 .",

    "raman heterodyne spectroscopy with radio frequency ( ca .",
    "0 - 200mhz ) is a commonly used technique for nuclear spins in rare earth dopants @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated in the microwave regime in ruby @xcite and metalloprotiens @xcite .",
    "these systems , however , are not as attractive for the realization of quantum frequency conversion because they exhibit much broader optical lines .",
    "raman heterodyne spectroscopy uses the three wave mixing that occurs from three energy levels in a @xmath15 configuration , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : levelssetup ] . to enhance the efficiency of the process we use a microwave resonator for the lowest frequency field .",
    "the @xmath16 ground state of er : yso is zeeman split under the presence of an applied magnetic field @xmath7 , making the @xmath17 transition resonant with the microwave cavity .",
    "when the input microwave field @xmath18 is applied it generates a coherence between levels @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "simultaneously , the optical coupling field @xmath21 drives a second coherence between levels @xmath20 and @xmath22 . the presence of these two coherences generates a third one between levels @xmath19 and @xmath22 , which gives an output signal field @xmath10 at a frequency equal to the sum of the frequencies of the microwave and the coupling fields . as long as the sample is small compared to the wavelength of the microwave field the signal field will be generated in the same spatial mode as the coupling beam .",
    "the signal field can then be readily detected in a photodiode as a heterodyne beat note on the coupling beam .",
    "the crystalline structure of yso belongs to the @xmath23 symmetry group , with two crystalographically inequivalent sites where erbium can replace yttrium . in this work we focused on ` site  1 ' with a transition wavelength of @xmath24  =  1536.478 nm @xcite .",
    "yso has three orthogonal optical extinction axes @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath25",

    "the optical @xmath25 axis of the crystal is aligned along the length of the cylinder , and so the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane is parallel to the end faces .",
    "the sample sits inside a copper three - dimensional loop - gap microwave resonator , with a resonant frequency of 4.9ghz and a linewidth of 16mhz ( quality factor @xmath26300 ) .",
    "this kind of resonator provides very good filling factors ( @xmath270.8 ) and makes optical coupling to the sample a simple task , since two optical windows can be opened in the end caps at a null point of the surface currents , thus not affecting the properties of the cavity very much . input and output microwave powers are coupled with a pair of straight antennas inside the cavity space .",
    "the input light , at 1536 nm , is coupled into and out of the sample with the aid of a pair of coupling prisms , and fibre coupled collimators .",
    "the input fibre is a single mode fibre , while for the output one we use a multi - mode fibre for ease of coupling .",
    "a superconducting magnet generates a magnetic field perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the sample ( i.e. in the @xmath28-@xmath29 plane ) between 0 and 300mt .",
    "the angle @xmath14 , measured from @xmath12 to @xmath7 , can be varied by rotating the sample .",
    "a more detailed explanation of the complete experimental setup can be found in appendix  [ app : setup ] .",
    "the strength for each of the optical transitions in fig .",
    "[ fig : levelssetup ] is given by the product of the electronic transition dipole moment and the overlap of the two spin states .",
    "this overlap is calculated by diagonalizing the spin hamiltonian @xcite an taking the inner product of the respective eigenstates .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field has to be chosen carefully , so as to maximize the difference between the quantisation axes for the ground and excited states and thus allow @xmath15 transitions .",
    "for the situation in which @xmath7 is contained in the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane the calculated angle that maximizes the overlap between states @xmath20 and @xmath22 is @xmath30 .    after the frequency conversion process , the ac component of the heterodyne signal detected in the photodiode is high - pass filtered and amplified , and sent into an rf spectrum analyser .",
    "an inconvenient consequence of using a multi - mode fibre for the output light is that there is loss in the modulation due to dephasing of the different propagation modes . in our setup",
    "this loss is typically from 3 to 10db , and it depends on the arrangement of the fibre . from the power detected by the spectrum analyser",
    "we can work out the optical power of the generated signal sideband @xmath31 .",
    "our raman heterodyne spectroscopy results are presented in the color plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : raman ] .",
    "the power of the generated signal field is measured as we scan the magnetic field and the coupling laser frequency @xmath32 . on the left side , in white , we plot an optical absorption spectrum for @xmath33  =  0 ( dotted line ) and for @xmath33  =  0.178 t ( solid line ) . note that due to various etalon effects",
    "the background of these measurements is not constant . in the optical absorption spectrum for @xmath33",
    "=  0.178 t the four optical transitions can be observed .",
    "the strong ones ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) appear as peaks around @xmath361.6ghz , while the weak ones ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) appear as smaller shoulders at about @xmath363.4ghz . the ratio between the absorption level of the weak and the strong lines is close to the expected value for @xmath39 . from the absorption measurements we can also extract an inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transition of @xmath272.5ghz fwhm . comparing the raman heterodyne spectroscopy data with the absorption spectrum at @xmath33  =  0.178",
    "t we see that the main four peaks in the color plot ( in red ) coincide with the absorption on each of the lines , as it is to be expected .",
    "it can also be seen that the peak signal is slightly higher for the lowest frequency peaks , which can be explained using hole burning arguments .      beneath the raman heterodyne spectroscopy data",
    "is the electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) spectrum of our sample . to take these epr measurements",
    "we apply a frequency modulated ( fm ) microwave signal into the input port of the microwave cavity and monitor the transmitted intensity using a lock - in amplifier . in this way",
    "we are able monitor the resonant frequency shift of our cavity ( @xmath40 ) as is done in pound frequency locking @xcite .",
    "as the spin transitions are swept through resonance with the cavity they pull the resonator frequency first one way then the other , resulting in dispersive shaped peaks .",
    "the collection of vertical lines in the raman heterodyne spectrum and the smaller peaks in the epr spectrum are due to the @xmath3er isotope , which has non - zero nuclear spin ( @xmath41 ) and therefore exhibits hyperfine splitting even for @xmath42 .",
    "the epr data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : raman ] shows a maximum frequency shift of around 180khz .",
    "the measurements shown in the figure are taken for an input microwave power of 0dbm , which is enough to start to saturate the microwave transition in the absence of the optical field . for saturation - free measurements , at lower microwave powers , we get a maximum shift of around 260khz , which agrees with our numerical simulations . from this epr shift",
    "we can extract a cavity - atoms cooperativity factor of the order of @xmath43 .    comparing the raman heterodyne and the epr spectra",
    "we can see that most of the features present in the raman heterodyne spectroscopy data are also replicated in the epr data .",
    "the epr peak present at @xmath44 t we assign to the er atoms in site 2 of yso .",
    "because the optical transition for these atoms is at a different wavelength we do nt see a signal in raman heterodyne spectroscopy .",
    "in this section we characterise the conversion process by examining the dependency of the output signal power with the input microwave and coupling powers .",
    "we compare these measurements with a numerical model of our experiment , which we also use to find out the various losses in our setup .",
    "finally we estimate the efficiency of the conversion process and discuss several ways by which it can be increased .      figure  [ fig : psplasprf ] shows , in red , the dependence of the signal field power with the input microwave power @xmath45 and the detected coupling laser power @xmath46 .",
    "the laser coupling power is measured at the output of the system , and is not corrected for optical losses between the sample and the power meter . in blue",
    "we plot the expectations for these measurements based on our theoretical model , briefly discussed below .",
    "the dependency of @xmath31 with @xmath45 follows the expected pattern for a three wave mixing process : it increases linearly until it reaches a saturation point , in our case around @xmath4720dbm .",
    "these measurements are taken for @xmath481.8mw .",
    "the dependency of @xmath31 with @xmath46 , however , does nt follow a quadratic relation for large laser powers .",
    "the faster than quadratic rate at which the signal increases with the pump laser power is due to optical pumping improving the population difference between the two i@xmath49 sublevels , lowering the effective spin temperature .",
    "this fact is particularly convenient since , for a low noise conversion process , the spins temperature will need to be small compared with the frequency of the input microwave field .",

    "[ fig : psplasprf ] , we treat each erbium atom as a three level system and use standard master equation techniques .",
    "this is described in detail in appendix  [ app : model ] .",
    "the optical and spin dephasing times are not know precisely and are allowed to vary , as is the spin lifetime . in the fitting process",
    "we also introduce two free parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 which take into account the propagation losses of @xmath45 from the setup input to the microwave cavity and the inverse loss of @xmath46 from the photodiode detector to the sample .",
    "the fitted values for these loss and inverse loss parameters are @xmath5213.1db and @xmath53 - 6.4db .",
    "it is hard to compare these two numbers with the measured losses of the setup , since losses are hard to quantify at low temperatures for practical reasons .",
    "the measured @xmath50 at room temperature is about 8db . in the regime where @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath45",
    "the loss of heterodyne signal in the multi - mode fibre is equivalent to a loss in microwave power .",
    "this multi - mode fibre loss is measured to be between 3 and 10db depending on the geometrical arrangement of the fibre . to these two numbers we have to add the effects of lowering the temperature in the coaxial microwave wires , which are unknown but",
    "can be expected to be on the order of a few db . for the optical losses we can measure the loss from the sample to the detector at room temperature , and it is around 5db .",
    "it is hard to make an estimation of how lowering the temperature will modify this number .",
    "we could observe a total decrease in transmitted power of -10db through our complete optical setup after the system was cold , but this number takes into account both , input and output losses , which we can not measure separately with the system inside the cryostat .",
    "all in all , we consider our fitted loss parameters to be in reasonable agreement with our observations .      by comparing the input and the signal field powers we can calculate a number conversion efficiency @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the input microwave frequency .",
    "this efficiency @xmath56 accounts for the fraction of microwave photons converted into optical telecom photons . for a coupling power of @xmath272mw and making the appropriate corrections for @xmath50 and @xmath51 we get a conversion efficiency of @xmath57 . in order to get closer to the target of unity conversion efficiency",
    "the most important improvement will be to add a doubly resonant optical cavity ( for the coupling and signal fields ) , which will improve the efficiency by a factor proportional to the finesse of the cavity squared @xmath58 , where @xmath59 can be as high as @xmath60 . on top of this effect , cavity enhancement of the coupling field should increase the effectiveness of the optical cooling of the spins , additionally increasing the efficiency of the conversion process .",
    "there are also numerous other improvements that can be made .",
    "a more homogeneous magnetic field is very desirable , since it would reduce the microwave inhomogeneous linewidth .",
    "the optical depth used in this experiment is also rather low ( 0.02mm@xmath61 ) .",
    "much larger optical depths have been observed in er : yso without the penalty of broader inhomogeneous lines @xcite .",
    "astonishingly narrow absorption lines with good optical depth have also been reported for erbium dopants in isotopically pure yttrium lithium fluoride @xcite .",
    "the q - factor of @xmath27300 for our microwave resonator is also rather modest  much higher q - factors for copper resonators have been reported @xcite",
    "in summary , we have presented a novel way to convert microwave signals into the optical telecommunications band , by means of a cryogenically cooled rare earth sample inside a three - dimensional microwave cavity .",
    "we have matched our raman heterodyne spectroscopy experimental results with a theoretical counterpart . finally ,",
    "although the efficiency of this initial demonstration is low , there are many ways to improve it , the most significant of which is enhancing the effect of the two optical fields with an optical resonator . among possible designs for this optical resonator",

    "while we havent performed any direct measurement of phase preservation in the up - conversion process we can be certain that this process is a coherent one .",
    "the observed heterodyne peaks are a few tens of hz wide .",
    "both the optical and the microwave transitions in er : yso are much wider than that , hence the only explanation is that this signal is indeed generated in a raman scattering process , which is inherently coherent . in other words : the only process in our sample that can generate such a narrow signal is a coherent process .",
    "in addition , we are performing heterodyne detection , so our measurements are only sensitive to that light which is coherent with the pump beam .",
    "( color online ) heterodyne signal as measured by the spectrum analyser , showing interference between the generated signal and the pick - up noise from the signal generator .",
    "the sidebands are attributed to sidebands in the laser frequency due to mechanical vibrations in the laser box . ]    to further support this claim there is the following experimental observation , represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pickupnoise ] .",
    "when measuring the raman heterodyne signal with the spectrum analyser the noise background is nt flat .",
    "instead we can observe a small peak at the signal generator s output frequency .",
    "this is pick - up noise coming directly from the signal generator s oscillator to the analyser ( and the amplifier preceding it ) , and it is present even when the output of the signal generator is shut down ( but the oscillator inside the signal generator is still on ) or the optical detector is blocked . when measuring the heterodyne signal power versus the input microwave power , for high microwave powers the heterodyne signal is much bigger than the pick - up noise , and the later one can be neglected . for low microwave powers , however , the detected peak becomes smaller than the pick - up noise alone .",
    "this means that the detected signal and the pick - up noise interfere destructively , which in turn means they are coherent with each other .",
    "it is safe to assume that the pick - up noise will be coherent with the signal coming out of the signal generator since they come from the same source , so we can conclude that the converted signal is coherent with the input microwave signal , and therefore so is the conversion process .",
    "to model the experiment and plot the blue lines in fig .  3 , we treat each erbium atom as a three level atom driven by a microwave field which connects the two lowest states @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and an optical pump field which connects states @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in the interaction picture",
