    "in an asexual population of finite size , weakly deleterious mutations can fix by chance .",
    "this phenomenon is due to stochastic fluctuations originating from the finiteness of the population , which can lead to a loss of the fittest class of individuals .",
    "if the genome is assumed to be so long that back mutations are unlikely and can be ignored , the fittest class is lost forever and the number of fixed deleterious mutations increases irreversibly .",
    "this process has been termed muller s ratchet @xcite and was observed experimentally in several studies @xcite . furthermore it has been thought to account for the degeneration of non - recombining parts of sexually reproducing organisms such as the y - chromosome @xcite and mitochondrial dna @xcite .",
    "muller s ratchet can also be used to explain the absence of long - lived asexual lineages @xcite . since in the absence of back mutations ,",
    "mutation - free genomes can only be recreated by recombination between mutation - loaded classes , muller s ratchet provides an appealing explanation for the evolution of sex @xcite .",
    "each time the least - loaded class , i.e.  the class with the fewest number of deleterious mutations , is lost , it is said that muller s ratchet has clicked . since the rate of the ratchet determines the speed of degeneration of the population , this quantity is of central interest . in its simplest form the rate of muller",
    "s ratchet depends only on the selection coefficient @xmath0 , the mutation rate @xmath1 and the size @xmath2 of the population , where it is assumed that each mutation has the same effect so individuals with @xmath3 mutations have fitness @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the fitness space is equivalent to an axis counting the number of deleterious mutations and the population can be organized into discrete classes labeled by the number of mutations they carry .",
    "the deleterious mutations have the effect of shifting the population to higher values of @xmath3 .",
    "since the fitness of the respective classes is given by @xmath4 , selection works into the opposite direction . in the limit of an infinitely large population these",
    "two opposing forces lead to a steady state distribution whose precise form was found by haigh @xcite .",
    "if finite populations are considered , however , the calculation of the rate of muller s ratchet turns out to be an intricate problem , despite its simple formulation .",
    "the difficulty arises due to the complex interaction of the fluctuation of the least - loaded class with the rest of the distribution .",
    "a detailed quantitative understanding of the behavior of the occupation of the class with the fewest mutations , however , is necessary to determine the mean time to extinction of this class , i.e.  the inverse of the ratchet rate . despite of considerable efforts and recent advances @xcite , a quantitative understanding of the ratchet rate",
    "remains a challenging open problem .    in its standard form muller s ratchet was first quantitatively described by haigh who analyzed a classical wright - fisher model of an asexually reproducing population of fixed size @xmath2 .",
    "he pointed out that the most important quantity of the ratchet is the average number of individuals in the least loaded class , @xmath5 , because fluctuations of @xmath6 ultimately lead to a click of the ratchet .",
    "later it was shown by jain that the ratchet rate can not depend only on @xmath7 but rather has to depend on @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath8 is small , the ratchet clicks frequently and the populations behaves like a wave in @xmath9space propagating towards higher values of @xmath3 .",
    "the traveling wave approach to muller s ratchet was discussed in @xcite and provides an appealing quantitative theory for frequently clicking ratchets .",
    "while this regime of muller s ratchet is relatively well understood , a quantitative understanding of the opposite case @xmath10 of a rarely clicking ratchet is still lacking and has recently attracted a lot of attention @xcite . in this regime",
    "the rate of the ratchet is exponentially small in @xmath8 @xcite and extinction of the fittest class occurs as the result of a rare large fluctuation .",
    "in contrast to the fast clicking regime the distribution of the population equilibrates to a metastable state after each click .",
    "a wide - spread approach in this regime is therefore to consider only the fittest class and apply a phenomenological model for all the classes @xmath11 , @xmath12 , with more mutations than the least - loaded class .",
    "such an approach leads to a one - dimensional approximation where just the fittest class is taken into account .",
    "generally the rate of the ratchet can then be calculated by means of a diffusion approximation as the result of a one - dimensional mean - first passage problem .",
    "recently it was shown how this approach can be improved by accounting for the interaction of the fluctuations of the fittest class with the tail of smaller fitness which can lead to a delayed feedback @xcite .    up to now a quantitative treatment of muller s ratchet relied either on haigh s model or on the corresponding diffusion approximation . to our knowledge",
    "a moran formulation with overlapping generations has not been employed so far .",
    "this is not surprising as in the diffusive limit any quantity should become independent of the respective microscopic formulation and a moran formulation of muller s ratchet is expected to be computationally disadvantageous .",
    "a moran formulation , however , can also lead to interesting new approaches to tackle the problem of the ratchet rate analytically .    in the present work we investigate a moran formulation of muller s ratchet and",
    "show how this model can be approximated by a one - dimensional moran - process in the regime @xmath10 where the ratchet clicks infrequently .",
    "we show that this model allows for an analytical solution for the ratchet rate which agrees almost perfectly with values obtained by numerical simulations of the full ratchet .",
    "furthermore , by employing a recently developed method to treat rare large fluctuations in stochastic population dynamics , we find analytical expressions for the ratchet rate and the quasi - stationary distribution of the fittest class in the parameter range @xmath13 which also agree very well with the corresponding results of the full ratchet .",
    "finally , we confirm numerically that the formulation with overlapping generations leads to the same results as the diffusion approximation and the corresponding wright - fisher model with non - overlapping generations .",
    "in the standard formulation of muller s ratchet , as considered by haigh @xcite , mutations in a population of fixed size @xmath2 occur at rate @xmath1 and individuals are classified into different groups according to the number of deleterious mutations they carry , @xmath3 .",
    "each mutation reduces the fitness of the genotype @xmath3 by an amount @xmath0 such that the growth rate of an individual with @xmath3 mutations is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the ratio of the mutation rate @xmath1 to the mutation effect @xmath0 , which is denoted by @xmath14 , plays a central in the analysis of the ratchet .",
    "the reproduction model usually employed in the analysis of muller s ratchet is wright - fisher sampling .",
    "it consists of , at each time step , replacing the whole generation of individuals by a multinomial resampling of the current generation @xcite weighted by the fitness of the different classes .",
    "thus , according to haigh @xcite , if @xmath15 is the number of individuals in generation t which carry @xmath3 mutations and @xmath16 , then the distribution of @xmath17 is multinomial with parameters @xmath2 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and the mean fitness @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 .",
    "wright - fisher sampling has the advantage of being very efficient for numerical simulations .",
    "the downside of the model is , however , that it does not easily allow for analytical methods to be used .",
    "therefore , the corresponding diffusion approximation of the microscopic wright - fisher formulation is usually used to predict the click rates of the ratchet .",
    "the second widely applied reproduction model in population genetics is the moran process which in contrast to the wright - fisher formulation assumes overlapping generations .",
    "the moran process on which we focus in this article is amenable to a wider range of analytical methods ( at the cost of being slower in numerical simulations ) @xcite .",
    "it is a stochastic process in which at each time step one individual is chosen for reproduction and one for removal from the population .",
    "the choice of the individual that reproduces is random , but ( similarly to the wright - fisher formulation ) weighted by the fitness of the class the individual is chosen from .",
    "the probability of removal ( or death ) of an individual is independent of the fitness .",
    "applied to muller s ratchet this therefore embodies the following procedure : an individual with @xmath3 mutations is chosen according to the abundance and selection preference of the class @xmath3 with weight @xmath22 .",
    "this individual spawns one offspring with @xmath3 mutations that can then mutate to @xmath23 mutations with probability @xmath24 .",
    "the probability to mutate is thus @xmath25 , which is the same as in the wright - fisher model .",
    "also , one individual with @xmath3 mutations is chosen for removal with probability @xmath26 ( this may be the one that reproduced ) . since on average",
    "every individual is chosen for removal once every n time steps , it is natural to define one generation in the moran model as n time steps . in all figures ,",
    "the ratchet click times are thus expressed in generations .",
    "although different on the microscopic scale , both wright - fisher and moran models usually converge to the same mesoscopic diffusion regime when @xmath2 is large and fitness advantages and mutation rates are of order @xmath27 . in this limit , the equation describing the evolution of the population is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the uncorrelated gaussian white noise @xmath30 with @xmath31 models the stochastic fluctuations due to the finiteness of the population ( genetic drift ) . in the infinite population limit , this equation becomes deterministic and has the steady - state solution @xmath32 @xcite . also , a time dependent solution of the deterministic model has been obtained @xcite . in this paper , we solve eq .   numerically using stochastic runge - kutta methods @xcite .",
    "a mathematical analysis of the moran model for muller s ratchet is complicated and even the formulation of the corresponding markov chain @xcite is involved and barely leads to new insights .",
    "the important advantage of moran models , however , is that they can be formulated in terms of a master equation @xcite",
    ". therefore moran models are analytically tractable even beyond the diffusion approximation , if only two species are considered .",
    "thus an appealing approach to the analysis of the rate of muller s ratchet is to approximate the full ratchet by a model consisting only of two species .",
    "since we are interested in the loss of the fittest class with zero mutations a natural choice is to consider individuals with zero mutations as one species , and to combine all others in a class which contains all individuals with one or more mutations .",
    "the constraint of a fixed population size @xmath2 then leads to a one - dimensional model .",
    "an illustration of the distribution of individuals in the space of mutations and the reduction to a one - dimensional model is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_ratchet ]     they carry .",
    "mutation ( blue arrows ) drives the population to higher values of @xmath3 , while selection ( yellow arrows ) opposes this motion , leading to a quasi - stationary distribution .",
    "the two - state approximation amounts to putting all mutated individuals in one mutated class ( light green box ) . both mutation into this class and selection pressure operating on it ( large arrows )",
    "have to be calculated from the original mutation rates and selection strengths . since the total population size is conserved , calculating the distribution of the number of individuals in the two classes reduces to the analysis of @xmath6 and thus to a one - dimensional problem.,height=288 ]    the master equation for the probability @xmath33 to find @xmath34 individuals in the fittest class is @xmath35 with the transition rates @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mutation rate away from the fittest class and @xmath38 is the fitness disadvantage when carrying a mutation @xcite .",
    "( here and in the following lowercase letters denote the parameter values of the approximative two - state model , while capital letters denote the parameters of the full ratchet . ) the idea of representing all classes but the fittest as one class was first introduced in @xcite for a wright - fisher model of muller s ratchet .",
    "a crucial step in the reduction of the full model of muller s ratchet to the one - dimensional formulation is the relation of the two mutation rates and fitness disadvantages in the respective models .",
    "this mapping is not unique and two reasonable assumptions have to be invoked to relate the two parameters pairs .",
    "a plausible approach is to compare the steady state distributions in the infinite population limit of the respective models . for the full ratchet",
    "the well - known steady state distribution for the probability of an individual to have @xmath3 mutations is @xmath39 .",
    "a non - zero steady state of the fittest class in the two - state system can only be obtained in the parameter regime @xmath40 and is given by @xmath41 .",
    "to relate the parameters we now demand that @xmath42 the mean fitness of the full population and @xmath43 the mean fitness of all individuals carrying a mutation is equal in both models .",
    "the mean fitness of the full population in the steady state of the full ratchet is @xmath44 while the mean fitness of all individuals in the two state model is @xmath45 .",
    "condition ( @xmath46 ) accordingly suggests the relation @xmath47 the mean fitness of all individuals carrying mutations is in the full ratchet model given by @xmath48 . in the two state model",

    "before we present the analytical solution for the ratchet rate of this model , let us shortly discuss the validity of the approximation used . to correlate the parameters of the full ratchet and the two state model , we have related properties of the equilibrium solution of an infinite population in both models .",
    "this certainly makes sense as long as the typical time @xmath56 that it takes for the population to relax to a metastable state after each click is much smaller than the mean time @xmath57 between two successive clicks .",
    "this condition is fulfilled in the case of the slowly clicking ratchet , which is the regime we focus on in this work .",
    "if the ratchet clicks rapidly the population does not equilibrate after a click and relating the parameters based on equilibrium distributions is clearly not valid .    a consequence of our relation ( [ relation1 ] )",
    "is that the mutation rates out of the fittest class are equal in both models which certainly is a reasonable assumption @xcite .",
    "furthermore our second relation ( [ relation2 ] ) entails that the number of individuals which are not in the fittest class is the same in the equilibrium states of both models , i.e.  @xmath58 .",
    "consequently the same holds true for the number of individuals in the fittest class .",
    "thus , although the parameter mapping is not unique , it is hard to think of any other relation in the slowly clicking regime as this would consequently violate the properties specified above .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the parameter mapping is only valid in the rare clicking regime and that other mappings might be more appropriate in the fast clicking regime @xcite .      with the reduction to a two - state problem as given in the previous section",
    ", we can now exploit the advantages that the moran formulation offers for analytical calculations .",
    "the mean click time of the ratchet is given by the mean first time of the population with no mutations reaching zero .",
    "it is well known that a solution of such a mean first passage time problem in a two - state model can be formally written as a product of the transitions rates and and is given by @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the initial number of individuals in the lowest mutation class population .",
    "this expression can be evaluated for moderate @xmath2 , but the number of terms grows quickly with @xmath2 which makes it more and more difficult to evaluate @xmath57 .    to compare our analytical results to the full ratchet we have performed extensive numerical simulations of the full moran ratchet using the rules detailed in section [ sec : models_and_methods ] .",
    "we organize our results as follows : the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 are grouped according to the conditions specified below , and then @xmath2 is varied . since the selection penalty @xmath0 can be interpreted as a timescale @xcite , we group parameters with the same rescaled mutation rate @xmath14 .",

    "furthermore it does not allow for any analytical statements about the distribution of the frequency of the fittest class .",
    "therefore , we want to gain quantitative insight into the ratchet rate and the distribution of the frequency of the fittest class by an approximative treatment of eq . .",
    "the most widely applied approach certainly is the diffusion approximation from which by standard methods the mean time to extinction ( mte ) @xmath57 can be calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "the resulting expression usually has to be evaluated numerically .",
    "while the diffusion approximation provides faithful results in the regime where an extinction event is the outcome of a typical fluctuation of the process , it in general may fail to describe the mte correctly when extinction occurs as the result of a rare large fluctuation @xcite . in the rare clicking regime the relaxation time to the metastable state is much shorter than the mean time between the clicks and the population equilibrates after each click .",
    "it is important to note that in such a scenario the click of the ratchet is due to a rare large fluctuation away from the metastable state .",
    "an approach to the treatment of master equations which is especially well suited to account for rare event statistics is the wkb- ( wentzel - kramers - brillouin ) theory .",
    "this approximation scheme which is sometimes referred to as the eikonal approximation was first developed for a semi - classical treatment of quantum mechanics and has recently attracted a lot of attention in the context of stochastic population dynamics @xcite .",

    "the approach we apply in the following was first considered in @xcite and later considerably extended and generalized in @xcite .",

    "first , the population size has to be finite and not too small , i.e.  @xmath66 .",
    "second the typical relaxation time @xmath56 to the metastable state should be much shorter than the mte , i.e.  @xmath67 .",
    "we note that here this condition has to hold anyway in order for the two state approximation to be meaningful .",
    "it can be shown that the metastable state , which is sharply peaked around @xmath68 , is encoded in the first excited eigenvector @xmath69 of the master equation ( [ master ] ) which has not decayed at a time @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "thus the shape of the pdf of the metastable state , which is referred to as the quasi - stationary distribution ( qsd ) , is given by @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , the decay rate of this distribution , i.e.  the ratchet rate @xmath71 , is determined by the first non - zero eigenvalue of the master equation ( [ master ] ) . as was shown in @xcite , the decay of the qsd for times @xmath72",

    "additionally the wkb approach allows for an analytical calculation of the frequency distribution of the fittest class in the quasi - stationary state .",
    "given that the two approximations , namely the reduction to two classes and the wkb - approach , are applied , the agreement of the analytical result with the numerical simulation of the full ratchet model is striking .",
    "this finding , in turn , strongly supports the validity of the reduced two - state model . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that analytical expressions for the quasi - stationary distribution of the fittest class could be calculated .",
    "the expression ( [ qsdfullsol ] ) could also be of interest for future experiments where the average time between successive ratchet clicks is large because the ratchet relaxes very quickly to its metastable state .",
    "as we have shown this relaxation time is only a fraction of the average inter - click - time and therefore might be experimentally more accessible in the slow ratchet regime .",
    "finally , we have confirmed that our results are in excellent agreement with the diffusion approximation and the corresponding wright - fisher formulation of the ratchet .",
    "we compare the exact solution of the click times in the two - state model given by eq .   to the analytic approximation calculated from the wkb - approximation , eq .  , and to the approximation of the wkb - result for large @xmath2 , eq",
