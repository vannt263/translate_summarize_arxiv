    "relativistic models of nuclear structure provide a consistent framework in which the nuclear many - body system is described in terms of interacting baryons and mesons .",
    "detailed properties of finite nuclei along the @xmath4-stability line have been very successfully described in the framework of relativistic mean field models ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "in addition to the single - nucleon mean - field , pairing correlations have to be taken into account for a quantitative description of ground - state properties of open - shell nuclei . for nuclei close to the @xmath4-stability line",
    ", pairing has been included in the relativistic mean - field model in the form of a simple bcs approximation  @xcite , with monopole pairing force adjusted to the experimental odd - even mass differences .",
    "pairing correlations are also crucial for the description of deformations in heavy nuclei . however , as we move away from the valley of @xmath4-stable nuclei , the ground - state properties calculated within the bcs approximation become unreliable .",
    "in particular properties that crucially depend on the spatial extensions of nucleon densities , as for example nuclear radii .",
    "the reason is that the bcs scheme does not provide a correct description of the scattering of nucleonic pairs from bound states to the positive energy particle continuum  @xcite , and it leads to unbound systems .",
    "the solution , of course , is a unified description of mean - field and pairing correlations , as for example in the framework of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory . within a non - relativistic approach to the nuclear many - body problem , hfb theory has a long and successful history of applications .",
    "in particular , hfb theory in coordinate space  @xcite has been used to describe properties of exotic nuclei with extreme isospin values , both on the neutron rich side  @xcite , and proton drip - line nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic extension of the hfb theory was originally derived by kucharek and ring @xcite .",
    "starting from the lagrangian of quantum hadrodynamics , they have been able to show that the pairing correlations result from the one - meson exchange ( @xmath5- , @xmath6- and @xmath7-mesons ) .",
    "the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the hartree approximation for the self - consistent mean field .",
    "however , if for the one - meson exchange pairing interaction in rhb one uses the coupling constants from standard parameter sets of the rmf model , the resulting pairing correlations are much too strong .",
    "the repulsion produced by the exchange of vector mesons at short distances results in a pairing gap at the fermi surface that is by a factor three too large . on the other hand",
    ", it has been argued in many applications of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory that there is no real reason for using the same effective forces in both the particle - hole and particle - particle channel . in a first - order approximation ,",
    "the effective interaction contained in the mean - field @xmath8 is a @xmath9-matrix , the sum over all ladder diagrams .",
    "the effective force in the @xmath3 channel , i.e. in the pairing potential @xmath10 , should be the @xmath11 matrix , the sum of all diagrams irreducible in @xmath3-direction .",
    "however , very little is known about this matrix in the relativistic framework and only phenomenological effective forces have been used in the @xmath3 channel of rhb . in the rhb calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite pairing correlations have been described by a two - body force of finite range of gogny type @xcite , @xmath12 with the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18 . for the d1s @xcite parameter set of the interaction the model",
    "was applied in the study of several isotope chains of spherical pb , sn and zr nuclei .",
    "the pairing interaction is a sum of two gaussians with finite range and properly chosen spin and isospin dependence .",
    "the gogny force has been very carefully adjusted to the pairing properties of finite nuclei all over the periodic table .",
    "its basic advantage is the finite range , which automatically guarantees a proper cut - off in momentum space . in refs .",
    "@xcite we have used rhb in coordinate space with the d1s gogny interaction to study properties of light nuclear systems ( c , n , o , f , ne , na , mg ) with large neutron excess .",
    "self - consistent solutions were calculated for the ground - states of a number of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "predictions were obtained for the location of the neutron drip - line , reduction of the spin - orbit interaction , @xmath2 radii , changes of surface properties , formation of neutron skin and neutron halo .",
    "the effective interactions in the @xmath3 channel of the hfb theory were recently discussed in ref .",
    "in particular , the role of finite range and the importance of density dependence were analyzed .",
    "finite range forces have the obvious advantage of the automatic cut - off of high momentum components . on the other hand computations with zero - range forces",
    "are much simpler , although an artificial energy cut - off has to be included .",
    "the density dependence of interactions in the pairing channel influences the spatial distributions of pairing densities and fields . by using interactions without density dependence ,",
    "strong pairing fields are produced in the volume of the nucleus .",
    "there is experimental evidence that pairing is a surface effect , and by including a density dependent component the pairing field can be made surface peaked .",
    "a fully self - consistent rhb model in coordinate space , with a density dependent interaction of zero - range ( delta force ) , has been used to describe the two - neutron halo in @xmath19li  @xcite .",
    "@xmath20\\ ] ]    in going away from the valley of @xmath4-stable nuclei , the main problem of nuclear structure models becomes the extrapolation of effective forces to nuclei with extreme isospin values .",
    "we have already applied rhb with the gogny force in the pairing channel to light neutron - rich nuclei . however , many of these nuclei are still not accessible in experiments and therefore many of our results could not be compared with empirical data . in order to make predictions for medium - heavy nuclei at the neutron drip - line , we have to test available effective interactions in detailed calculations of properties of neutron rich nuclei for which a comparison with experimental data is possible . in the present article we consider two sets of isotopes : ni ( @xmath21 ) and sn ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "such an analysis will test the predictions of effective forces in both the @xmath23 and @xmath3 channel over two major neutron shells .",
    "in addition to the effects of the pairing interaction , we are particularly interested in the behavior of the spin - orbit term of the effective potential as function of the neutron number . for light neutron rich nuclei , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the magnitude of the spin - orbit potential is considerably reduced at the drip - line , resulting in much smaller energy splittings between spin - orbit partners .",
    "for the ne isotopes this reduction was found to be around forty percent .",
    "since it seems that at present only relativistic models include the correct isospin dependence of the spin - orbit term in the mean - field potential , it would be important to study in medium - heavy nuclei the predicted spacings of single - neutron levels close to the fermi surface .",
    "the details of the rhb model are given in refs .",
    "a short outline of essential features follows .",
    "the ground state of a nucleus @xmath24 is described as vacuum with respect to independent quasi - particle operators , which are defined by a unitary bogoliubov transformation of the single - nucleon creation and annihilation operators .",

    "_ correlations , and a pairing field @xmath10 which sums up the _ pp _ correlations .",

    "the objective is to study how well does the nl3 effective force describe systems with very different number of neutrons , without going to nuclei with extreme isospin values .",

    "compared to experimental values , the theoretical binding energies are @xmath73 1 mev larger for neutrons in the 1g@xmath74 orbital ( @xmath75 ) . for sn isotopes the results of model calculation in general display an overbinding .",
    "the differences are larger for @xmath71sn , but we expect that for these nuclei additional correlations should be taken into account in order to get a better agreement with experimental data .",
    "in particular , proton - neutron pairing could influence the masses in this region .",
    "proton - neutron short - range correlations are not included in our model .    in fig .",

    "the surface thickness @xmath76 is defined to be the change in radius required to reduce @xmath77 from 0.9 to 0.1 ( @xmath78 is the maximal value of the neutron density ; because of shell effects we could not use for @xmath78 the density in the center of the nucleus ) .",
    "the diffuseness parameter @xmath79 is determined by fitting the neutron density profiles to the fermi distribution @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the half - density radius . by adding more units of isospin",
    "the value of the neutron surface thickness increases and the surface becomes more diffuse .",
    "the increase in @xmath76 and @xmath79 is more uniform in sn , and both parameters increase approximately forty percent from @xmath82sn to @xmath83sn .",
    "a somewhat smaller increase in the surface thickness is observed for ni isotopes .",
    "the diffuseness parameter for ni is essentially a step function : @xmath84 fm for @xmath85 and @xmath86 fm for neutrons in the 1g@xmath74 orbital .",
    "we will show that the observed changes in surface properties result from the reduction of the spin - orbit term in the effective single - nucleon potential .    in figs .",
    "[ fige ] and [ figf ] we display the neutron and proton @xmath2 radii for ni and sn isotopes , respectively .",

    "@xcite . in the lowest panels",
    "we also compare the differences @xmath87 .",
    "we find an excellent agreement between experimental data and values calculated with the nl3 effective force with the d1s gogny interaction in the pairing channel .",
    "the model predicts a uniform increase of @xmath2 radii with the number of neutrons .",
    "the neutron skin @xmath87 increases to approximately 0.4 fm at the closed shells @xmath88 for ni , and @xmath67 for sn .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that in the framework of the relativistic mean - field model the magnitude of the spin - orbit term in the effective single nucleon potential is greatly reduced for light neutron rich nuclei . with the increase of the number of neutrons",
    "the effective spin - orbit interaction becomes weaker and this results in a reduction of the energy splittings for spin - orbit partners .",
    "the reduction in the surface region was found to be as large as @xmath89 for ne isotopes at the drip - line .",
    "the spin - orbit potential originates from the addition of two large fields : the field of the vector mesons ( short range repulsion ) , and the scalar field of the sigma meson ( intermediate attraction ) . in the first order approximation , and assuming spherical symmetry , the spin orbit term can be written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the spin - orbit potential  @xcite @xmath92 v and s denote the repulsive vector and the attractive scalar potentials , respectively .",
    "@xmath93 is the effective mass @xmath94 using the vector and scalar potentials from the nl3 self - consistent ground - state solutions , we have computed from  ( [ so1 ] ) - ( [ so3 ] ) the spin - orbit terms for the ni and sn isotopes .",
    "they are displayed in figs .",
    "[ figg ] and [ figh ] as function of the radial distance from the center of the nucleus .",
    "the magnitude of the spin - orbit term @xmath95 decreases as we add more neutrons , i.e. more units of isospin .",
    "if we compare @xmath96ni with @xmath97ni , in fig .",
    "[ figg ] , the reduction is @xmath98 in the surface region .",
    "this implies a significant weakening of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the minimum of @xmath95 is also shifted outwards , and this reflects the larger spatial extension of the scalar and vector densities , which become very diffuse on the surface .",
    "the reduction of the spin - orbit term seems to be less pronounced in the sn isotopes ( fig .",
    "[ figh ] ) , and this indicates that the weakening of the spin - orbit interaction might be not that important in heavy nuclei . the effect is reflected in the calculated spin - orbit splittings of the neutron levels in the canonical basis @xmath99 in fig .",
    "[ figi ] we display the energy splittings of spin - orbit neutron partners for ni and sn , respectively .",
    "the calculated spacings are shown as function of the neutron number .",
    "we only include the spin - orbit doublets for which one of the partners is an intruder orbital in a major shell .",
    "these doublets display the largest energy splittings .",
    "we notice in fig .",
    "[ figi ] that the spacing between spin - orbit partners decreases with neutron number .",
    "the effect is stronger in ni than in sn , and quantitatively the observed decrease is consistent with the gradual weakening of the spin - orbit term shown in figs .",
    "[ figg ] and [ figh ] .    in order to illustrate the properties of the interaction in the @xmath3 channel , in figs .",
    "[ figj ] and [ figk ] we plot the average values of the neutron canonical pairing gaps @xmath100 as functions of canonical single - particle energies .",
    "the gaps are displayed for canonical states that correspond to the self - consistent ground states of @xmath101ni and @xmath102sn , respectively .",
    "@xmath100 are the diagonal matrix elements of the pairing part of the rhb single - nucleon hamiltonian in the canonical basis .",
    "although not completely equivalent , @xmath100 corresponds to the pairing gap in bcs theory .",
    "a very detailed discussion of hfb equations in the canonical basis can be found in ref .",

    "[ figk ] ) we essentially reproduce the results calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite with the gogny hfb+d1s model .",
    "the calculated pairing gaps are almost identical , although there is a difference in the canonical single - neutron energies due to different effective forces used in the @xmath23 channel . while we employ the nl3 effective meson - exchange interaction in the @xmath23 channel , in the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite the gogny effective force has been used both in the @xmath23 and @xmath3 channel .",
    "the pairing gaps display a uniform decrease with single - neutron energies .",
    "this is related to the volume character of the gogny interaction in the pairing channel .",
    "the values of the @xmath100 for the s@xmath103 orbitals are slightly larger , and the average value at the fermi surface is around 1.5 mev .",
    "it should be noted that for the hfb+skp calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite the values of the pairing gaps are strongly peaked at the fermi surface . in addition , we have calculated the average canonical pairing gaps for @xmath101ni ( fig . [ figj ] ) . as compared with @xmath102sn , the @xmath100 display a very similar behavior for deep - hole states ( although for 1s@xmath103 the pairing gap is considerably smaller ) , but they decrease more slowly for canonical states in the single - neutron continuum . at the fermi surface the average values are between 1 and 1.5 mev , somewhat smaller than in @xmath102sn .    finally in fig .",
    "[ figl ] we compare the averages of the neutron pairing gaps for occupied canonical states @xmath104 where @xmath105 are the occupation probabilities .",
    "the quantities @xmath106 are plotted as functions of the neutron number for ni and sn isotopes .",
    "solid lines correspond to even , and dashed lines to odd - neutron isotopes .",
    "@xmath106 provides an excellent quantitative measure of pairing correlations .",
    "the quasi - parabolic functional dependence on the number of neutrons reflects the increase of pairing correlations toward the middle of a major shell . both for ni and sn the values of @xmath106 are above 2 mev in the middle of the corresponding shells .",
    "as one would expect , the values for odd - neutron isotopes are somewhat lower .",
    "while in sn the average pairing gaps do not provide any indication of additional shell effects , in ni they very clearly indicate the shell subclosure at @xmath107 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that pairing correlations are stronger in the subshell @xmath108 , than for neutrons in the 1g@xmath74 orbital .    in conclusion , in the present work",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of ground - state properties of ni ( @xmath0 ) and sn ( @xmath1 ) nuclei in the framework of the relativistic hartree bogoliubov theory .",
    "the nl3 parameter set has been used for the effective mean - field lagrangian in the @xmath23 channel , and pairing correlations have been described by the finite range gogny interaction d1s . in a comparison with available experimental data , we have shown that the nl3 + gogny d1s effective interaction provides an excellent description of binding energies , neutron separation energies , and proton and neutron @xmath2 radii .",
    "the results indicate that this choice of model parameters might also be valid for nuclei with more extreme isospin values , i.e. medium - heavy nuclei at the drip - lines .",
