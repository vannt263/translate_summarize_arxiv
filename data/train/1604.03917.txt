    "the low - temperature spin - relaxation time ( @xmath0 ) of n - doped semiconductors presents a maximum for doping densities near that of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite .",
    "this experimental observation is particularly intriguing as it encompasses both , the rich physics of spin - orbit coupling in semiconductors and a paradigmatic quantum phase transition . on the one hand ,",
    "the spin dynamics in different semiconductor - based systems is relevant from the fundamental point of view , as well as for potential applications of spintronics and quantum information technologies @xcite . on the other hand , despite a substantial research effort , the mit remains one of the most challenging open problems in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "while the mechanisms behind spin relaxation were promptly identified for the regime of high temperatures or for doping densities far away from the critical one @xcite , the understanding of the low - temperature spin - relaxation close to the mit required a sustained theoretical effort @xcite . on the metallic side of the transition ( for impurity densities @xmath1 slightly larger than the critical one @xmath2 ) the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling was identified as the source of the spin - relaxation in the case of zinc - blende semiconductors . in particular , it was proposed that when the electron conduction is in the impurity band ( @xmath3 ) , the spin - relaxation rate is given by @xcite @xmath4 @xmath5 is the material - dependent dresselhaus coupling constant @xcite , while the other parameters in eq .",
    "depend on the nature of the impurity states : the effective bohr radius ( @xmath6 ) , the binding energy ( @xmath7 , and the dimensionless impurity density ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the hybridization density @xmath9 marks the impurity concentration beyond which there is a considerable overlap between the impurity and conduction bands .",
    "the form of the relaxation rate is quite general . in the above - specified density interval",
    ", it applies to any zinc - blende semiconductor , with the possible exception of narrow - gap materials .",
    "indeed , it has been shown to give good account , within the experimental uncertainties and the limited knowledge of some material parameters , of the spin - relaxation measured in gaas and cdte , despite the very different material constants of these two semiconductors .",
    "for instance , the mott criterion for the mit setting the critical dimensionless impurity density @xmath10 , leads to @xmath11{cm^{-3}}$ ] ( @xmath12{cm^{-3}}$ ] ) for gaas ( cdte ) , and there are two orders of magnitude difference between the corresponding values of @xmath0 for these two cases@xcite .",
    "eq . has been analytically derived and it is in good agreement with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "both theoretical approaches ( analytic and numerical ) are based on a generalization of the well - known matsubara - toyozawa ( mt ) model @xcite , describing the diffusion of non - interacting electrons through randomly distributed impurity sites , so as to include spin - flipping hopping terms @xcite . in the numerical approach",
    ", the spin - relaxation time is extracted from the evolution of initial states with a well - defined spin projection .",
    "the weakness of the spin - orbit coupling and the finite system sizes that can be handled require the use of delicate extrapolations and a finite - size scaling analysis . in the analytic formulation",
    ", the spin - relaxation rate is obtained from the diffusive accumulation of spin rotation angles as the electron jumps between impurity centers .",
    "such a phenomenological approach needs to be put on a firm basis as a well - controlled approximation that can be extended in a systematic way in order to accurately describe various parameter regimes .",
    "the present work addresses the above - mentioned task and develops a systematic self - consistent diagrammatic perturbation approach to obtain the long - time charge and spin dynamics in a disordered network of impurity sites .",
    "the phenomenological result of eq .",
    "is qualitatively recovered using a simple self - consistent approximation in a locator expansion of the self - energy which can be analytically solved . in a second approximation",
    ", we include diagrams describing loops of arbitrary length , which can be shown to give the dominant contributions in the limit of high impurity densities @xcite .",
    "the resulting charge diffusion coincides with that of the mt diagrammatic expansion@xcite , and the spin - relaxation rate improves the previous estimation , correcting its density dependence .",
    "further refinements of the self - consistent approach can be implemented in a systematic way by considering repeated scattering with given impurities ( i.e. cross diagrams ) .",
    "in particular , we consider repeated scattering from pairs of impurities , which has been shown to be dominant for low - concentration densities @xcite .",
    "we show that these processes lead to small corrections for the range of impurity densities we are interested in ( @xmath3 ) , thus confirming the applicability of the high - density limit in this regime .",
    "our approach relies on two drastic simplifications : working with a zero - temperature formalism and ignoring electron - electron interaction .",
    "detailed temperature - dependent measurements of the spin - relaxation time @xcite yielded a saturation of @xmath0 below , indicating that inelastic processes can be ignored at low temperatures . in the case of the n - doped semiconductors , the mit appears at a doping density @xmath2 where the fermi level is in the impurity band @xcite .",
    "electron - electron interactions are crucial in order to account for the observed features of the mit @xcite and induce significant many - body effects on the insulating side of the transition ( @xmath13 ) . therefore , we restrict our work to metallic densities ( @xmath14 ) away from the critical region , where a single - particle description is possible .",
    "our main interest is in the extension of the self - consistent approach in order to include spin - orbit effects in the mt model of the impurity band , leading to the zero - temperature density - dependent spin - relaxation time .",
    "additionally , the treatment of the high and low impurity concentrations within the same self - consistent framework constitutes a useful development for the much studied spinless mt model @xcite and other cases where a resonant excitation is able to jump between the sites of a disordered network . in general",
    ", our approach can be applied to any random network model with hopping matrix elements depending on the distances between randomly placed sites .",
    "the problem of the excitation transport in ultra cold rydberg gases is an example of such a disordered network , which has recently received considerable attention experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "another example is provided by molecular light - harvesting complexes @xcite ( at least for times shorter than the decoherence times induced by coupling to environmental degrees of freedom ) , where the impact of quantum coherence on excitation transport is under current debate @xcite .",
