    "the position of maxim corresponds to @xmath208 .",
    "the relative width of the resonant region depends on the coupling , @xmath15 , to the vibrational mode as @xmath209 .",
    "we also predict that , in the vicinity of the resonance , the dependence @xmath30 exhibits a hysteretic behavior with two stable values of @xmath23 corresponding to two stable regimes of the rabi oscillations .",
    "the underlying physics of the rabi - vibronic resonance is the following . without coupling , population inversion , @xmath49 , and displacement , @xmath134 ,",
    "satisfy the harmonic oscillator equations with frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath0 , respectively . with coupling ,",
    "two - level system acts as a driving force @xmath210 on the oscillator , while the back - action of the oscillator on @xmath49 is peculiar .",
    "the structure of back - action force is @xmath211 , as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ wrabi ] ) , ( [ urabi ] ) .",
    "this structure implies that back - action is of a parametrical type , i.e. , @xmath212 adds to @xmath185 .",
    "thus , at @xmath17 , it appears that @xmath4 is modulated with frequency @xmath213 .",
    "this , however , does not lead to a parametric instability .",
    "instead , the oscillator motion gets synchronized with the rabi oscillations . in this regard ,",
    "there is certain analogy to the synchronization of the rabi oscillations to a sequence of pulses @xcite applied to the detector with repetition period chosen to be @xmath214 .    as it was pointed out in introduction , the situation when",
    "a two - level system undergoing the rabi oscillations is coupled to the oscillator is actively studied in connection to the circuit qed@xcite . the most common situation in circuit qed",
    "is when the oscillator frequency , @xmath215 , is tuned to the transition frequency , @xmath7 , of the two - level system . among physical effects predicted for this domain",
    "is that two or multiple qubits can get strongly coupled to each other via coupling to a common oscillator@xcite .",
    "rabi - vibronic resonance corresponds to the domain @xmath216 .",
    "still the effects similar to those discussed in refs .",
    "[ ] will take place under the conditions of the rabi - vibronic resonance .",
    "in particular , we anticipate that rabi oscillations in two driven two - level systems with @xmath197 , coupled to the same oscillator will get synchronized .    as a final remark , classical treatment of the vibrational mode adopted in the present paper",
    "does not allow one to capture the quantum jumps@xcite between the stable regimes of collective motion of the two - level system coupled to the oscillator .",
    "we also did not consider the effect of thermal noise which leads to the activated switching@xcite between the steady regimes even within a classical description of the oscillator .",
