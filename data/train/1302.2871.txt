    "* in our hybrid trap @xcite , the tight radial confinement with a trapping frequency @xmath37hz is provided by an infrared laser beam ( wavelength 1075 nm , power 120mw , waist @xmath38 m ) . the much weaker axial confinement with a trapping frequency @xmath39hz results from the curvature of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the frequency ratio @xmath40 corresponds to the aspect ratio of the trapped cloud .",
    "* sound excitation and detection . *",
    "the green laser beam ( wavelength 532 nm , power @xmath41mw ) used for excitation is focused to a waist in the range of 25 - 35@xmath42 m . to excite first sound ,",
    "we suddenly turn it on to introduce a repulsive potential hill with a height of about 10% of the cloud s chemical potential in the trap center . for the case of second sound ,",
    "the repulsive beam is permanently on during the preparation of the quantum gas with a barrier height of about 15% of the cloud s chemical potential .",
    "the excitation is then induced by a burst of 8 cycles of sinusoidal power modulation .",
    "the modulation frequency is set to 1720hz , but the scheme is rather robust and was found to work best in a frequency range between roughly @xmath43 and @xmath44 times the radial trapping frequency .",
    "the burst envelope is rectangular and the modulated barrier has a peak - to - peak amplitude of 30% of the cloud s chemical potential . after the burst",
    ", the power is set back to its initial constant value . on the time scale of the axial motion ,",
    "the time - averaged power of the green beam is constant , which avoids direct excitation of first sound .    for the detection of the propagating second - sound signal ,",
    "the corresponding density dip is essential . the 1d formulation of the eos in ref .",
    "@xcite allows us to relate the observed depth to the relative temperature change . in the temperature range of our experiments ,",
    "the corresponding thermodynamic coefficient @xmath45 takes values @xcite between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which means that the typical 3% relative depth of the density dip roughly corresponds to a local temperature increase of about 6% .    *",
    "1d fermi temperature and critical temperature . *",
    "three different definitions for fermi temperatures are related to natural energy scales of our trapping geometry .",
    "the homogeneous case with a 3d number density @xmath48 ( including both spin states ) is given by @xmath49 .",
    "within the local density approximation the corresponding fermi energy for @xmath50 atoms in a three - dimensional harmonic potential is given by @xmath51 , commonly used to describe the global situation of a 3d trap .",
    "the fermi energy of cylindrically confined cloud in the center of a 2d harmonic trap , which we refer to as ` 1d fermi temperature ' , follows from @xmath52 , where the relevant density is the linear number density @xmath15 . for the additional axial confinement in our trap geometry , @xmath15 and",
    "thus @xmath53 become @xmath14-dependent quantities .    for specifying the critical temperature @xmath33 in units of the relevant fermi temperature , we also distinguish between the three different situations of a homogeneous system , a 3d harmonic trap , and a cylinder with 2d harmonic confinement . for the homogeneous system",
    ", @xmath54 was measured in ref .",
    "@xcite . based on the local density approximation and the experimentally determined eos",
    ", this result can be translated into corresponding conditions for the other two situations .",
    "while for the 3d trap , @xmath55 is relevant for the occurrence of the phase transition at the center of the trap , the condition @xmath56 applies to the 2d confined case . in our highly elongated trap geometry with weak axial confinement , @xmath53 and",

    "* reconstruction of superfluid fraction . * within the framework of universal thermodynamics @xcite , the number density of a uniform , resonantly interacting fermi gas can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless universal function @xmath58 by @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 is the thermal de broglie wavelength , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath61 gives the ratio between the chemical potential @xmath42 and the thermal energy @xmath62 , with a unique correspondence existing between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the function @xmath58 is known from measurements of the eos @xcite . the superfluid density can be expressed in an analogous way as @xmath65 , introducing a corresponding universal function @xmath66 , which is to be extracted from our measurements . using the local density approximation",
    ", one can show for a system with radial harmonic confinement that @xcite @xmath67 , where @xmath68 represents the value of @xmath63 on the trap axis .",
    "analogously , the 1d superfluid density is given by @xmath69 .",
    "one thus easily sees that the 1d superfluid fraction is given by @xmath70 and only depends on @xmath68 . from our experimentally determined @xmath20",
