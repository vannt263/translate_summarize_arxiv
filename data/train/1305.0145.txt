    "the charge on the rim of the armchair cap is higher than on the rim of the zigzag cap .",

    "the carbon atoms of the cap that are not part of the rim have an average valence charge of about 4 e , with low deviations ( below @xmath140 ) , which means that they do not take part in the charge redistribution / polar binding between the metal catalyst and the carbon cap .",

    "the localisation is slightly higher for the armchair edges with about @xmath141 of the charge localised at the outer rim atoms compared to about @xmath142 at the outer edge zigzag cap atoms , which is the reason why the armchair rim atoms yield a higher charge per bond .",
    "the charge on the cap increases with fe content and becomes maximal for the elemental fe cluster .",
    "we observe the same behaviour at the rim , with the exclusion of the @xmath1 cap on fe , which , however , may be an artifact , as only one cap was considered on spot 3 .",
    "the higher charge points to a higher reactivity on fe compared to ni , which likely leads to a faster growth rate on iron compared to nickel , previously observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite    the fe atoms do not only supply their electron charge to the c atoms , but also to the ni atoms , see the charge transfer for the nife alloy systems in [ tab : chargedistributionnife ] .",

    "following from the reactivity argument , which results from the increased charge on the edge atoms , we can give a geometric argument for the preference of armchair over zigzag structures in the following .",
    "it follows from the number of edge sites .",
    "we consider the line density of edge sites , which corresponds to the number of edges sites divided by the circumference of the nanotube rim @xmath148 with @xmath149 the number of armchair and zigzag sites and @xmath150 the circumference of the tube .",

    "the comparison of the @xmath0 cap to the @xmath1 cap presented here , serves as an example as they have nearly identical diameters , but a different number of edge sites .",
    "the increased number of sites with higher chiral angles leads to an enrichment of armchair / near - armchair tubes in nanotube samples from simple geometric reasoning .",
    "this geometric argument might also be translated to growth rate considerations of nanotubes .",

    "a decrease of the electric dipole moment is correlated with the ni content in the composition of the catalyst particle , where higher ni content leads to lower electric dipole moments .",
    "the zigzag caps have higher electric dipole moments compared to the armchair caps , which is likely a result of the weaker localisation of electron charge at the carbon - metal bond forming atoms for the zigzag caps .",

    "a higher landing probability might also become a problem , if the carbon atoms can not be incorporated at the edge faster than the carbon precursors land on the particle , as this might lead to amorphous carbon encapsulation of the catalyst and prevent further growth . the higher landing probability for zigzag caps can lead to a reduced number of zigzag tubes , as zigzag edges are expected to have a slower growth rate , which makes it especially hard to fulfill the requirement of fast carbon incorporation to prevent catalyst encapsulation .",

    "wang  _ et al .",
    "_ suggested that the short ranged charge distribution on nanotube edge atoms and catalyst atoms might be important for the chirality - selective growth of carbon nanotubes , as electron charges would increase the reactivity of the edge atoms .",
    "@xcite we observe an increase of electron charge on the carbon edge atoms with charge supply by the metal atoms in agreement with wang  _ et al._.  @xcite the average charge values on the carbon rim atoms , see [ tab : chargedistributionnife ] , compare well to the values calculated by wang  _ et al .",
    "_ for , e.g. , the @xmath0 nanotube cap on nickel we find an average value of @xmath192 which compares to the slightly higher values of wang  _ et al .",
    "_ between @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "to determine the effect of the charges on chirality distributions , we also put a focus on alloy systems . in",
    "alloy systems a charge distribution between two metallic species leads to an electron accumulation not only on the carbon edge atoms , but also on the nickel atoms .",
    "we find higher charges on armchair than on zigzag edges , which was suggested by wang  _ et al .",
    "_ to be used to influence the chirality",
    ".  @xcite the alloy composition has a significant effect on the charge distribution .",
    "we find an increase of electron charge on the carbon cap edge atoms from ni to fe with increasing fe content in the alloy , pointing to an increased growth rate of nanotubes through increased reactivity of the nanotube edge atoms , which compares well to the higher growth rates found for iron compared to nickel .",
    "@xcite another relevant factor for the growth rate was found to be the metal d orbital energy .",
    "@xcite the charge distribution patterns suggested by wang  _ et al .",
    "_ resemble the edge structure of armchair and zigzag sites .",
    "theoretical studies can only model some aspects of the nanotube growth , neglecting other aspects , e.g. , the effect of ostwald ripening ,  @xcite that influence the chirality distribution as well .",
    "further the chirality distributions determined in experiments have to be regarded with care as huge differences for the abundances of the chiralities might arise through the method used to determine the abundances , i.e. the intensity of a measured entity is not directly proportional to the abundance of the tube .",
    "@xcite therefore we did not expect to obtain results that perfectly match our growth model , however , we see it as a success that the model correctly describes the qualitative features of the chirality selective growth process , which suggests , that the model might include some part of the truth to solve the puzzle of chirality selective growth .",
    "in summary we calculated adhesion energies , excess energies , and electronic charge redistributions between carbon nanotube caps and nife alloy systems using density functional theory . the highest adhesion energies and lowest excess energies",
    "are found for the @xmath2 alloy cluster , for both armchair and zigzag caps .",
    "the energy differences between armchair and zigzag were found to be low .",
    "the curved form of the catalyst particle can be regarded as a constraint to the fit between the nanotube edge and the catalyst , which tends to lower the energy difference between armchair and zigzag caps .",
    "the small energy differences between the armchair and zigzag caps allow to derive carbon addition barriers , which - using the growth model presented in this paper - lead to chirality distributions that compare satisfactorily with experimental results .",
    "the charge transfer between the cap and the catalyst particles increases with increasing fe content , which induces a dipole moment .",
    "the charge transfer to the armchair caps is higher than to the zigzag caps , in contrast to the electric dipole moment , which is higher for zigzag than for armchair caps and has a maximum of about @xmath195 on the iron particle .",
    "this is a consequence of the chirality dependent line density of edge sites , which decreases with lower chiral angle .",
    "the excess electron charges on the carbon rim atoms increase with fe content of the catalyst particle from @xmath3 for ni to @xmath4 for fe .",
    "the excess electron charges increase the reactivity of the carbon cap atoms , which explains why the nanotube growth rate on iron is higher than on nickel .",
    "our results will be useful for the understanding of the growth of carbon nanotubes on alloy catalysts .",
