    "chalcogenide glasses have been the subject of numerous experimental works in the recent decades . basically , there are two different ways to produce samples for experiments ; liquid - quenching and evaporation . in the first case",
    "the initial phase of raw materials is liquid while in the latter case the starting compound is vaporized .",
    "usually , the quenched materials are named glasses and the amorphous forms are prepared from gas phase onto substrates .",
    "the principal advantage of rapid quenching compared to evaporation is that the method can provide large volume of samples",
    ". there may be differences in the physical properties of samples produced by different ways because these states are non - equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "our particular aim was to determine how the structural changes occur due to the different preparation methods . in order to obtain an answer for this question we performed molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "our atomic networks contained about 1000 selenium atoms interacting via classical empirical three - body potential @xcite .",
    "non - crystalline selenium has received particular attention since it is the model material of twofold coordinated covalently bounded chalcogenide glasses .",
    "there are two main possibilities for structural modeling on the atomic scale . first is monte carlo ( mc ) type methods .",
    "traditional mc using a potential minimizes the total energy in energy hyper - surface .",
    "recently a new version of this method - the so - called reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) simulation - has been developed which is also convenient for investigation of amorphous materials .",
    "it is based on results of diffraction measurements .",
    "this method was applied for constructing large scale a - si and a - se models @xcite .",
    "second , molecular dynamics ( md ) also needs a local potential to describe the interaction between atoms .",
    "we have developed a md computer code ( atomdep program package ) to simulate real preparation procedure of disordered structures .",
    "amorphous and glassy structures are usually grown by different vapor depositions on substrates . in our recent md work @xcite ,",
    "the growth of amorphous carbon films was simulated by this method .",
    "only a brief summary of our simulation technique is given here ( for details , see ref .",
    "a crystalline lattice cell containing 324 selenium atoms was employed to mimic the substrate .",
    "there were 108 fixed atoms at the bottom of the substrate .",
    "the remaining atoms could move with full dynamics .",
    "the simulation cell was open along the positive @xmath0 direction and periodic boundary conditions were applied in @xmath1 , @xmath2 directions .",
    "kinetic energy of the atoms in the substrate was rescaled at every md step  ( @xmath3 = 1  fs ) in order to keep the substrate at a constant temperature . in this kind of simulation",
    "there is no _ ad hoc _ model for energy dissipation of incoming atoms . in the deposition process",
    "the frequency of the atomic injection was 300  fs@xmath4 .",
    "this flux is orders of magnitude larger than the deposition rate commonly applied in the experiments but we compensate this disadvantage by a low substrate temperature . after bombarding ( no more incoming atoms ) there were 30  ps periods for structure relaxations in each case .",
    "three different structures [ sestr ] have been constructed by the technique mentioned above at the temperature of 100  k. the average bombarding energies of sestr0.1 , sestr1 , and sestr10 models were 0.1  ev , 1  ev and 10  ev , respectively .",
    "rapid cooling of liquid phase is frequently applied to construct glassy structures .",
    "the system is usually cooled down to room temperature by a rate of 10@xmath510@xmath6  k / s in computer simulations although this rate is some orders of magnitude smaller in the experimental techniques . in order to retrieve information on the rapid cooling ( melt - quenching ) , we prepared a model ( sestrq ) in the following way .",
    "temperature of a deposited film ( sestr1 ) was increased up to 900  k as an initial state ( liquid phase ) , while the substrate temperature remained the same .",
    "after this melting , the trajectories of the selenium atoms were followed by full dynamics for 100  ps .",
    "the substrate temperature kept at 100  k leads to the cooling of the film above the substrate .",
    "this technique can be considered as the computer simulation of real splat cooling , where small droplets of melt are brought into contact with the chill - block .",
    "pair potentials can not be used for covalently bonded structure because these types of potentials can not handle the bond angles .",
    "we need at least three body interactions . for our simulation",
    "we applied a classical empirical three - body potential @xcite .",
    "the parametrization of this potential is based on fitting the structures of small se clusters determined by dft calculations and experimental data due to crystalline phase .",
    "there are several different crystalline forms of selenium . basically , they consist of chains and eight - membered rings .",
    "typical bond lengths are around 2.35     while most of the bond angle values can be found around @xmath7 .",
    "snapshot of the amorphous sestr1 network ( bottom half part ) is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we considered 2.8    as an upper limit of bond length .",
    "substrates remained similar to the crystal lattice arrangement during the bombardment and the relaxation procedure .",
    "the average bond length in our a - se models is @xmath8  .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that the average distance between twofold coordinated first - neighbor selenium atoms ( se@xmath9-se@xmath9 ) is equal to 2.35  ,  while in case of se@xmath9-se@xmath10 and se@xmath10-se@xmath10 those values are 2.41   and 2.47  ,   respectively ( see table [ tablei_se ] ) . in order to ignore the effect of the rough surface on the top of the grown film we identified two different cells : bulk and total sample ( see ref .",
    "the top side of the bulk was by 5    below the atom having the largest @xmath0 coordinate , furthermore , bulk does not include substrate atoms at the bottom . in fig .",
    "[ fig2_se ] pair correlation functions of our sestr1 model and an unconstrained rmc simulation @xcite based on experimental data are shown in the interval of 1 - 5   .",
    "all the other models provide similar radial distribution functions .",
    "first and second neighbor peak positions are similar to trigonal crystalline case but broadened because of torsion inside the chains . there is a characteristic inter - chain distance in @xmath11 crystalline phase at 3.43     which is completely disappeared from pair correlation function .",
    "a histogram of calculated bond angles in our model is displayed in the fig .",
    "[ fig2_se ] . the main contribution to",
    "the bond angle distribution arises from angles between 95@xmath12 and 110@xmath12 . in @xmath11 selenium",
    "the bond angle is @xmath13 which is larger than the average value in our simulations ( @xmath14 ) . considering the local arrangements we can not distinguish between deposited and quenched models .",
    "the average coordination number in a - se is approximately two as shown in table [ tableii_se ] .",
    "there is no fourfold coordinated selenium atom but we found threefold coordinated atoms ( defects ) in every models . in quenched sample ( sestrq )",
    "we obtained 8 atomic % while in the deposited samples this ratio is higher .",
    "the structures of different models consist almost of the same number of atoms . for realistic density calculations one should consider only bulk densities .",
    "table[tablei_se ] contains these densities of different models which are between 3.21  g / cm@xmath10 and 4.34  g / cm@xmath10 . for crystalline @xmath11 , @xmath16 and metallic selenium",
    "the densities are equal to 4.4  g / cm@xmath10 , 4.35  g / cm@xmath10 4.8  g / cm@xmath10 which are larger than the values we obtained for a - se , i.e.   our molecular dynamics simulation provided lower dense structures . in order to investigate the homogeneity we divided the structures prepared by deposition and by rapid quenching into @xmath17=5   thick layers .",
    "a significant difference was observed in the local density fluctuation of two models . in fig .",
    "[ fig4_se ] five layer densities of both models are displayed in function of time .",
    "one can conclude that sample prepared by rapid quenching is more homogen than the deposited counterpart .",
    "this is an observable difference we obtained for two different preparation techniques .",
    "we have developed a molecular dynamics computer code to simulate the preparation procedure of a - se networks , which are grown by a vapor deposition technique and prepared by rapid cooling in order to make a comparison between the atom - by - atom deposition on a substrate and the melt - quenching preparation techniques .",
    "the most important difference we have found between the models prepared at various conditions , is in local density .",
    "bond length and bond angle distributions are very similar in both cases .",
