    "bone age assessment typically involves estimating the age of a patient from a radiograph by quantifying the development of the bones of the non - dominant hand .",
    "it is used to evaluate whether a child s bones are developing at an acceptable rate , and to monitor whether certain treatments are affecting a patient s skeletal development . currently , this task is performed manually using an atlas based system such as greulich and pyle ( gp ) @xcite or a bone scoring method like tanner and whitehouse ( tw ) @xcite .",
    "atlas methods such as gp involve comparing the query image to a set of representative hand radiographs taken from subjects at a range of ages .",
    "scoring systems assign each bone to one of several predefined stages , then combine these stage classifications to form an age estimate .",
    "manual procedures are time consuming and often inaccurate .",
    "automated systems for bone age assessment have previously been proposed .",
    "these either attempt to recreate the tw or gp methods @xcite , or construct regression models for chronological age @xcite .",
    "our approach is modular and feature based , and can be used to either recreate tw scores or predict age directly .    to predict tw bone stages we train a range of classifiers on three transformations of the outline .",
    "the first uses an ensemble technique described in  @xcite that uses elastic distance measures directly on a one dimensional representation of the bone outline .",
    "the second technique finds discriminatory subsequences of the one dimensional series ( called shapelets ) through a transformation described in  @xcite and constructs classifiers in the shapelet feature space .",
    "finally , we derive a set of summary shape features based on the tw descriptors .",
    "we conclude that the classifiers built on shape features are significantly better on at least one bone and provide greater explanatory power .    to predict age directly , we perform linear and non linear regressions from the shape feature space to age . we evaluate this process on a data set of images taken from  @xcite in the age range 218 .",
    "we show that , given the correct outline , we can accurately recreate tw stages and , using just three bones , can predict chronological age as accurately as clinical experts .",
    "this stepwise , feature driven approach to automated bone ageing is transparent and explicable to clinicians . by separating out the feature extraction from the segmentation and regression we retain the potential for quickly and simply constructing new models for regional populations .",
    "this offers the possibility of producing age estimates tailored to local demographics based on data stored locally in film free hospitals .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : baa ] , we review the current manual methods , and describe previous attempts at automated bone age assessment .    in section [ sec : extraction ] we describe how we format the segmented bones into outlines and shape features and in section  [ classifiers ] we provide an overview of the classification and regression techniques we use to predict bone age . in sections  [ sec :",
    "twstages ] and [ regression ] we present our results .",
    "finally , we discuss our conclusions and describe the future direction of this work in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "bone age assessment is a task performed in hospitals worldwide on a daily basis .",
    "the skeletal development of the hand is most commonly assessed using one of two methods : greulich and pyle ( section [ sec : gp ] ) @xcite or tanner and whitehouse ( section [ sec : tw ] ) @xcite .",
    "the bone age estimate obtained by one of these methods is compared with the chronological age to determine if the skeletal development is abnormal .",
    "if there is a significant difference between the patient s bone age and chronological age then the paediatrician may , for example , diagnose the patient with a disorder of growth or maturation  @xcite .",
    "the greulich and pyle ( gp ) method uses an atlas of representative hand radiographs taken from subjects at a range of ages .",
    "the latest ( second ) edition of the gp atlas was released in 1959 @xcite which included new images for four new age points .",
    "the final atlas consists of 31 standard radiographs of males from newborn to the age of 19 years and 27 standard radiographs of females from newborn to the age of 18 years . along with each standard",
    ", there is a piece of text describing the development . to use the atlas ,",
    "the clinician checks the patient s radiograph against each of the example radiographs of the appropriate sex .",
    "the key features to check are the development of the epiphysis ( the region at the end of particular bones ) and the presence of certain carpal bones .",
    "the age estimate is the age of the subject who provided the representative image selected as the closest by the clinician .",
    "this process is clearly somewhat subjective and a large variation between clinicians has been observed @xcite .",
    "the representative images are from a very restricted sample taken over 60 years ago , and variation , changes in diet , healthcare and culture may mean this sample is no longer representative .",
    "another criticism of gp is that the method implies an assumption that the ossification process happens in an linear fashion , which may not be true .      in 1975 , tanner _",
    "@xcite published a scoring system commonly referred to as tw2 .",
    "two separate methods of calculating bone age are described .",
    "the first method uses the radius , ulna and short bones ( rus ) ( the short bones cover the metacarpals and phalanges of fingers one , three and five ) .",
    "the second method uses just the carpal bones .",
    "the rus method has been found to outperform the carpal bone technique and is easier to use .",
    "each bone has various stages associated with it and each stage has certain descriptors to use in the classification .",
    "table [ tab : twstage ] shows an image of each stage for the distal phalange of the middle finger with the associated criteria .",
    "once all bones have been awarded a score , these scores are summed to find the skeletal maturity score ( sms ) .",
    "the distribution of ages for the sms is described by a centile chart , from which a point estimate of bone age can be derived .",
    "the tw3 method was published in 2001 @xcite .",
    "the basic maturity stages and scores remained the same but the centile charts have been updated to adapt to the modern population .",
    "[ tab : twstage ]    .the various tw stages of distal phalange three @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      one of the benefits of adopting a linear regression model is the ease with which we can perform an exploratory analysis of the feature relevance .",
    "the epiphysis models include 15 - 17 terms , including a large number of interactions .",
    "the model for the proximal phalange is @xmath0 the index of each variable corresponds to the feature number given in table  [ tab : features ] .",
    "our first observation is that the model consists almost exclusively of epiphyseal features ( the exception is @xmath1 , metaphysis to width ratio ) .",
    "this is true for the other two bones also .",
    "this implies that future image processing efforts should focus more on accurately extracting and summarising the epiphysis .",
    "secondly , the features epiphysis width ( @xmath2 ) and epiphysis distance to phalanx ( @xmath3 ) are common to all models and are the first to enter the stepwise forward selection .",
    "clearly they are the most important factors , and alone account for approximately 80% of the variability in age ( @xmath4 on two variable linear model ) .",
    "the model constructed on just the proximal phalangeal features , epiphyseal width and epiphyseal distance to phalanx has a mae of 0.98 and rmse of 1.67 .",
    "this implies that it would be very easy to construct a simple , practical model that would give a fairly accurate estimate based on two measurements that can be quickly performed by a non - specialist directly from the image .",
    "this offers the potential for screening for abnormality at very low cost .",
    "a further benefit of the linear model is that , if the regression assumptions hold , we can construct confidence and prediction intervals for new data .",
    "this improves utility of the model in the decision making process because the decision of whether development is abnormal can be phrased as a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is that the difference between bone age and chronological age is zero .",
    "a linear model also offers a simple way of determining whether there are differences in age model between populations .",
    "we address the question of whether the models for male and female are significantly different by adding a factor to indicate sex . with regressors @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 if the subject is male and @xmath8 if female , we find that we can not reject the null hypothesis that the @xmath6 coefficient is zero and the resulting model is @xmath9 if we fit a stepwise model , sex is the fourth variable to enter the model , and the interaction with @xmath2 is also significant . clearly , sex is a predictive variable and future models should include the term .    the other demographic variable we have available is ethnicity . to test the significance of ethnicity ,",
    "we include for factors to model whether the subject was asian ( a ) , african - american ( f ) or hispanic ( h ) .",
    "the only significant factor we find is whether subject is asian .",
    "this is significant in the simplified model and in the stepwise model it is the second most important variable .",
    "clearly there is a different development process at work for the patients with asian ethnicity used in this study .",
    "if we include both sex and ethnicity , the _ dmp _ epiphysis model with three bones has a rmse of 0.855 ( compared to the human raters whose estimates had rmse of 0.89 ) .",
    "we describe three alternative approaches for using bone outlines to classify bone age stage and conclude that the shape features based on tw descriptors is the most appropriate .",
    "we then use these shape features to construct regression models of chronological age . the results for models predicting both tanner - whitehouse stage and chronological age are at least as good as those reported for other automated bone ageing systems .",
    "furthermore , with just three bones , we produce age estimates that are as accurate as expert human assessors using the whole image .",
    "data and code for each of these classification problems is available from  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the predictive accuracy , there are several benefits of using feature based regression models .",
    "firstly , we can explain the importance of individual variables .",
    "just two variables account for about 80% of the variation in age , and this relationship offers the potential for fast screening for abnormalities . secondly ,",
    "when the regression assumptions are valid , we can construct confidence and prediction intervals .",
    "this can aid diagnosis and implies that increasing the training set size will incrementally improve the models ( by reducing the variance ) .",
    "finally , we can test the importance of alternative demographic variables and construct models tailored to specific populations .",
    "we demonstrate this through an assessment of sex and ethnicity to the model .",
    "this offers several interesting possibilities : film free hospitals could enhance the quality of the general model through including their own data ; geographic and demographic effects on bone development can be studied ; historic data could be mined to quantify the effects of development drugs .",
    "there are many potential applications for an accurate age model constructed on a diverse and expanding database of images .",
    "there are several obvious ways of improving our models .",
    "we shall include more bones and examine the effect of intensity features .",
    "we can investigate alternative segmentation and outline classification algorithms .",
    "we can attempt to screen for full maturity to improve the no epiphysis models .",
    "we can estimate age via the full tw methodology rather than directly .",
    "our conclusion from the research we have conducted to date is that the feature based system of separating the image processing from the age modelling is the best approach .",
    "it offers flexibility , transparency and produces accurate estimates .",
