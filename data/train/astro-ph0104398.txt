    "the antennae ( ngc  4038/4039 = arp  244 , see fig .  [",
    "figure : antennaedss ] ) are a pair of closely - interacting disk galaxies in the advanced stages of merging , named after the appearance of the two spectacular galactic tails produced by gravitational tidal forces during the interaction .",
    "there are a number of similar systems known , including ` the mice ' ( ngc  4676a / b ) described by hibbard ( 1995 ) and ` the superantennae ' ( iras  192547245 ) described by mirabel et al.(1991 ) .",
    "also visible to the south - west of the southern tail of the antennae is the edge - on spiral dwarf galaxy eso  572g045 ( fig .",
    "[ figure : antennaedss ] ) , which has no measured optical velocity .",
    "some parameters of the antennae and eso  572g045 are given in table  [ table : thegroup ] .",
    "on a large scale , the antennae appears roughly symmetrical , although the southern tail is more prominent both optically ( fig .",
    "[ figure : antennaedss ] ) and in  ( van der hulst 1979 ; this paper ) .",
    "the two galaxies retain distinct nuclei as seen from optical and co observations .",
    "however , the galactic disks , while still present , are colliding and have severely disrupted one another .",
    "the two nuclei are currently @xmath0113 or @xmath06.3  kpc apart across the line - of - sight , according to co measurements by stanford et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . as a result of the collision",
    ", vigorous star formation is occurring in the disks and in the overlap region between them .",
    "this is evidenced by a variety of data , for example hst optical observations ( whitmore & schweizer 1995 ; whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ) , and iso infrared observations ( e.g.  vigroux et al .",
    "1996 ) which show a high infrared luminosity in the two nuclei and particularly in the overlap region .",
    "the tidal tails , disturbed structure , and star formation , are all classic features of interacting galaxies . given this and the closeness of the system ( @xmath1 for the antennae ( whitmore & schweizer 1995 from de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) giving a hubble distance of 19.2  and a linear scale of 1  @xmath2  kpc . ] ) , the antennae have attracted a lot of attention in observational and theoretical studies of galaxy interaction .      the antennae were first seen by c.o .",
    "lampland of lowell observatory in 1917 ( parker 1990 ) , and were later described by shapley & paraskevopoulos ( 1940 ) , and minkowski ( 1957 ) , who identified the pair with a radio source and first described them as interacting galaxies . they were also noted as number 244 in the arp atlas of peculiar galaxies ( arp 1966 ) .",
    "systems resembling the antennae were produced in the pioneering computer modelling simulations by toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) , providing the first theoretical proof that features such as galactic tails were produced by gravitational tides between interacting galaxies , leading to much of the present understanding of their evolution .",
    "clutton - brock ( 1972 ) published work similar to the toomres , but less extensive .",
    "the antennae are the first or ` earliest ' of the 11 systems in the ` toomre sequence ' ( toomre 1977 ) , and are still used for modelling ( e.g.  barnes 1988 ; mihos , bothun & richstone 1993 ) .",
    "collectively , these simulations have disproved , for most interacting systems , earlier explanations for galactic pairs and interaction effects , such as the suggestion by arp ( 1969 ) that when two galaxies of different sizes were interacting , the smaller one was an ejected component of the larger .",
    "observations of the antennae have been made at many radio , infrared , optical , and x - ray wavelengths , including many emission lines such as  ( amram et al .",
    "1992 ) ,  ( nikola et al .  1998 ) , co  j=10 ( sanders & mirabel 1985 ; stanford et al .",

    "these include high - resolution 6  and 3.5  observations by neff & ulvestad ( 2000 ) , and  observations by mahoney , burke & van der hulst ( 1987 ) and by hibbard , van der hulst & barnes ( 2001 , in prep ) .",

    "( 1996 ) , and most recently using chandra by fabbiano , zezas & murray ( 2000 ) .",
    "there are numerous  regions distributed in a ring in the ngc  4038 ( northern ) disk and a few also along an arc in the ngc  4039 ( southern ) disk .",
    "the shape of their distribution is roughly that of a letter ` e ' , and is seen clearly as knots , or compact objects , in blue optical images as well as in  ( amram et al .",
    "1992 ) and in the radio continuum ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 ) .",
    "the hubble space telescope resolved the  regions into many groups and clusters of young stars , with over 700 mostly blue compact objects 2030  wide ( whitmore & schweizer 1995 ; whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the location of one particular group of optical and radio continuum knots in the overlap region between the two galactic disks , combined with the youth of the stars , suggests that this star formation activity is caused by the on - going interaction .",
    "further high - resolution mid - infrared studies using the iso satellite ( mirabel et al .",
    "1998 ) show the strongest star formation in the overlap region , accounting for half of the @xmath3 flux , rather than in the more optically spectacular star - forming ring .",
    "this is explained as a result of obscuration by the large quantity of dust , which tends to hide star - forming regions at optical wavelengths but also makes them highly visible in the infrared ( kunze et al .",

    "wilson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) produced detailed co maps and molecular mass estimates for the disk region using the caltech mm - array .",
    "the maps show seven giant molecular cloud complexes , including the two nuclei and five complexes in the disk overlap region which have on - going massive star formation .",

    "it contains many hot , young stars , and coincides with a major concentration of  which has been noted in earlier studies ( van der hulst 1979 ) .",
    "this dwarf is of particular interest because it matches the results of computer modelling , confirming that tidally - disturbed material can become concentrated enough to form bound objects ( barnes & hernquist 1992 , 1996 ) .",
    "additionally , observing a dwarf galaxy soon after its formation could shed light on the origin and star - forming properties of such galaxies , about which little is currently known .    ' '' ''     + section  2 describes the observations and data reduction .",

    "the implications of the data , and its relationship to previous work , is given in section  4 .",
    "finally , section  5 presents a summary of our new and interesting results .",
    "we have observed the antennae group using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , a linear east - west oriented radio interferometer with six 22-m parabolic dishes .",
    "table  [ table : obsdetails ] gives details of the observations . in total , four successful 12  hour observations were obtained ( plus one additional 23  hour run ) using different antenna arrays chosen to give baselines spread across as wide a range as possible .",
    "the dual 20/13  feedhorns on the atca , producing two independent ifs , were used to observe in both bands simultaneously .",
    "data reduction was performed , unless otherwise stated , using the miriad analysis package ( sault , teuben & wright 1995 ) .",
    "all radio images presented have been corrected for primary - beam attenuation . in some figures ,",
    "pixels below @xmath6 have been masked out prior to correction to exclude noise .",
    "all velocities are in the heliocentric reference frame and the ` optical ' definition @xmath7 .",
    "the measured  velocities have an uncertainty of about 5 .",
    "positions are expressed in the j2000 system , including any from other papers .",
    "the 20  data ( if1 ; see table  [ table : obsdetails ] ) covered the red - shifted  emission line of neutral atomic hydrogen , plus some continuum channels to each side .",
    "the data was hanning - smoothed to a resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "channels at each edge of the passband ( attenuated by 50% or more ) were removed , giving a remaining bandwidth of @xmath9 .",
    "this band was used to produce separate  line and 20-cm continuum datasets , using a first - order polynomial ( or baseline ) fit to the line - free channels to each side of the spectrum .    the 20  ( 1413 ) flux for pks  1934638 is @xmath014.88  jy . the derived antenna gains ranged from 0.99 to 1.06 , indicating a typical @xmath034% change during calibration .",
    "the line data for the individual observations were then combined and fourier - transformed to produce a spectral image cube .",
    "the visibilities were weighted using ` robust ' weighting with the robustness parameter equal to 1 , chosen to give a good compromise between sensitivity and resolution .",
    "this image cube was cleaned by deconvolution using a combined hgbom / clark / steer algorithm ( hgbom 1974 , clark 1980 , steer et al .  1984 ) .",

    "the map was restored using a circular restoring beam of 42 .",
    "the task was used to produce maps of   integrated intensity ( moment-0 ) , intensity - weighted mean velocity ( moment-1 ) and velocity - dispersion ( moment-2 ) . to smooth the cube spatially and in velocity",
    "we used a three pixel ` boxcar ' function and a five channel ` hanning ' function , respectively .",
    "a lower flux cutoff of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 after smoothing ) was applied .    the 20  continuum map ( fig .",

    "the  emission consists of a single peak in the disk overlap region , generally brightening with increasing velocity .",
    "above 1560a second peak to the south is seen , moving southward and forming the inner half of the southern tail .",
    "a third peak beginning at @xmath20 forms the outer half of that tail , the two meeting near the tail s center and disappearing at @xmath21 .",
    "the northern tail is also detected ( @xmath22 ) and possesses a previously unknown extension towards the west at a similar velocity .",
    "the dwarf galaxy eso572g045 about 30  south - west of the tip of the southern tail is detected in the velocity range @xmath23 .",
    "the disk region and the southern tail have similar  masses of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ( see table  [ table : histats ] ) .",
    "the exact division between the two regions is arbitrary since there is no clear boundary between them , although the southern tail only has velocities above @xmath26 .",
    "the northern tail has an  mass of @xmath27 .",
    "we calculate an  mean velocity for the antennae , of @xmath28 , obtained from the moment maps ( fig .",
    "[ figure : himomentmaps ]  a , b ) ( the mean for the disks is @xmath29 ) . this is similar to the @xmath30 systemic velocity obtained from optical measurements of the nuclear velocities ( see table  [ table : thegroup ] ) .",
    "the column density in table  [ table : histats ] is obtained from the   moment-0 map using the following formula : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is surface brightness , @xmath33 is velocity , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the major and minor beam fwhm . for our  maps with a resolution of 42  there is @xmath36 per  of moment-0 .",

    "the disks have a substantial  velocity dispersion ( see fig .",
    "2f ) , with a peak of @xmath45 about @xmath46 south of the ngc  4039 nucleus ( table  [ table : thegroup ] ) , far from the intensity peak .",
    "the high dispersion results from the dual - peaked spectrum in its vicinity .",
    "the dominant feature in the south - east is the base of the southern tail , which attaches smoothly to the disks .",
    "although a clear division is seen in the  diagram ( fig .",

    "the iso - velocity contours change orientation suggesting that the tail bends sharply toward the end , in agreement with a sharp bend in the optical image",
    ". hence this concentration might be just the result of projection in a tail with varying orientation .",
    "compared to the southern tail , the northern tail contains less   ( @xmath56 ) , is shorter and covers a smaller radial velocity range ( 15501620 ) .",
    "its velocity decreases steadily with distance from the disks .",
    "there is a notable  gap between the northern tail and the disks ( see fig .",

    "our data suggests instead a ) that disk  has been extensively kinematically disturbed by disk collision or the preceding close encounter , b ) that it is now largely detached from the individual galaxies , with most of it no longer following closely their original disk structure , and c ) that it resides largely in a single structure between and surrounding the disks .",
    "further , this structure is connected smoothly to the -rich southern tidal arm .",

    ", a clear pattern was seen .",
    "galaxies with no bulge experienced nuclear gas inflows early in the merger , producing a steady moderate starburst and depleting the gas prior to the final stages of the merger .",

    "the latter resolve greater detail in the disks , e.g.  more emission peaks in the eastern half .",
    "the faint emission at the base of the southern tail is not seen in these maps , but is clearly detected in the low - resolution vla 20-cm map .",
    "the low - resolution 20  map by hummel & van der hulst ( 1986 ) has the same sensitivity and resolution as our fig .",
    "[ figure : antennae20_13cm_overlay]a , allowing a direct comparison .",
    "the measured fluxes agree well within the errors .",
    "our image includes slightly more extended emission at faint levels , but most of it is likely to be noise .    the well - resolved emission peaks in our radio continuum maps , particularly in the 13  image ( fig .",
    "[ figure : antennae20_13cm_overlay]b ) , agree with those in the  map by amram et al .",
    "our resolution is too low to allow a detailed comparison of the radio continuum and  peaks .    with radio continuum closely matching optical  regions and  maps ,",
    "the antennae agree with the correlation between star formation and the , fir , and radio , noted for example by sanders & mirabel ( 1985 ) .",
    "toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) performed pioneering computer simulations which clearly demonstrated for the first time that galactic tails originate through tidal interaction .",
    "however , these simulations entirely neglected the self - gravity of the disk material as well as dispersion effects , which have been considered in more recent simulations .",
    "the omission of simulated velocity fields in many theoretical papers on galaxy interactions often renders impossible a direct kinematic comparison between  observations and model predictions .",
    "fortunately , van der hulst ( 1979 ) obtained and published graphically the velocity information not published by toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) , and used it to compare observed  diagrams to predicted ones .",
    "after rescaling of dimensions to fit the data , the match was quite close .",
    "computer simulations ( e.g.  appendix viii of hibbard 1995 ; hibbard & mihos 1995 ) predict that material in a tail will be ejected along many different trajectories , with a large - scale filament - like structure due to the similarity of trajectories of neighbouring material , rather than being a stream of material along a common trajectory . in this way , it resembles a density wave , with the wave initially moving outward from the galactic disks , and in most cases later falling back inward under gravity .",
    "consequently , the material velocities tend to be at a large angle to the orientation of the tail , and disk galaxy models do not apply to tidal tails .",
    "more recently , barnes ( 1988 ) carried out tree - code n - body simulations of interacting disk galaxies , incorporating full self - gravity and a bulge / disk / halo model .",
    "the first model made was a look - alike of the antennae , for which a number of figures were published , including a  diagram along the orbital plane , approximately north - south ( see his fig .",
    "this is roughly a modelled equivalent of our fig .",
    "[ figure : hipv]b , but showing all material originating from the disk rather than just .",
    "these two figures bear a very close resemblance , except that the observed southern  tail is much more prominent than the northern one , whereas the model diagram shows them fairly comparable in size .",
    "hibbard & mihos ( 1995 ) performed similar simulations based on earlier vla data for the merging pair ngc  7252 , which closely resembles the antennae .",
    "the observed  diagram ( their fig .",
    "1 ) closely resembles our observed ones for the antennae ( fig .",
    "[ figure : hipv ] ) .",
    "that work particularly mentioned the final destination of material in tidal tails ( their figs .",
    "the bulk of tail material has an elliptical trajectory taking it back towards the disks , much of it quite rapidly .",
    "some , however , may gain escape velocity , with material further from the disks also having higher velocities .    by analogy",
    ", it can be inferred that the outer - most material in the southern tail of the antennae ( including the concentration at the tip ) , may take quite some time to fall back , if it does at all .",
    "however , the turn - around in radial velocities in the southern tail indicates that it is substantially bent along the line - of - sight ` towards ' the disks , suggesting that the tip is falling back .",
    "this interpretation , though , is unlikely to be correct since computer simulations show that the energy of tail material increases with distance from the center , and thus outer portions of the tail will take longer to fall back ( j. hibbard , private communication ) .",
    "there is no obvious spatial displacement between the optical and  emission in the tails ( fig .",
    "[ figure : himomentmaps ] ) as has been observed in other interacting systems , e.g.  arp  157 , arp  220 , and arp  299 ( see hibbard , vacca and yun 2000 ) .",
    "the primary differences are : * ( 1 ) * the widths of the tails , * ( 2 ) * the highly visible  pool at the end of the southern tail , * ( 3 ) * the greater length of the southern tail in , and * ( 4 ) * the absence of  at the base of the northern tail . the latter might be due to ionisation by emission from the disks as suggested by hibbard , vacca and yun ( 2000 ) .",
    "the  in the tails is clearly more extended laterally than the stellar emission .",
    "short - exposure optical images ( e.g.  fig .",
    "1 ) show both tidal tails to be fairly narrow with a width of 3040  ( 2.83.7  kpc ) , much less than the  width of @xmath0100  ( 9.3  kpc ) .",
    "deeper optical images of the antennae ( schweizer 1978 ) , however , show both tails more being extended .",
    "the strong stellar emission from the antennae tails is somewhat unusual since most tidal tails are optically faint .",
    "this general trend may come about because material which is ( pre - interaction ) further from the galactic centre , is less tightly bound gravitationally , and more affected by intergalactic tidal forces , and thus generally contributes most of the material in tidal tails ( e.g.  toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "this and the fact that in most galaxies the gas is much more extended than the stellar component , leads to tails initially containing a lot of gas and relatively few stars .",
    "furthermore , the rapid decrease in the gas density of tidal arms , due to differential expansion after their creation , should result in a corresponding decrease in star - formation rates , and hence a drop in optical emission ( mihos , richstone & bothun 1991 ) .",
    "the fact that the antennae do not show low optical brightness , suggests that the material in the tails derives from a more inner part of the disks than what is often seen in other galaxies .",
    "although the disks show continuum emission , we have found none from either of the tidal tails , except at the base of the southern tail . since",
    "radio continuum emission is generally produced extensively in star - forming regions , e.g.  by hot gas or shocks in supernova remnants , its absence in the tails implies a low level of star formation .",
    "the absence of detectable radio continuum in tidal tails is also quite common for other observed interacting systems , and agrees with predictions by mihos , richstone & bothun ( 1991 ) and others , who have undertaken computer simulations of interaction - induced starbursts , modelling galactic close encounters and the resulting collisions of giant molecular clouds and inwards gas flows , believed to be the means by which starbursts are produced in interacting galaxies .",
    "mihos , richstone & bothun ( 1991 ) studied star - formation rates for pairs of disk galaxies undergoing encounters ( but not mergers ) at a number of separations and relative orientations .",
    "they found that in some cases close encounters will actually reduce star formation , by throwing clouds out of the disk and reducing their density , without producing many collisions .",
    "however , prograde encounters ( both disks rotating in the same sense as their orbit about one another , e.g.  the antennae ) , tend to produce quite strong starbursts and extensive transfer of material between the disks .",
    "such encounters could also produce starbursts along the leading edges of tidal tails .",
    "however , such tails expand rapidly and the star formation rate drops considerably after a couple @xmath84 ( mihos et al .",
    "1991 ) , so that tails will generally have no detectable star formation activity when observed well into a close encounter or merger .",
    "the enhanced  column density at the tip of the southern tail coincides with the location of a young ( @xmath85 years ) star - forming region , suspected to be a dwarf galaxy formed during the interaction ( schweizer 1978 ; mirabel , dottori & lutz 1992 ) .",
    "the enhancement , by a factor of @xmath86 compared to the tail s minimum can at least in part be explained as a projection effect due to the bending of the tail and hence a deeper line of sight .",
    "however , such a large ratio requires a substantial bending angle , hence there is likely to be an enhanced local gas density at the location of the star - forming region : a point already made by van der hulst ( 1979 ) .",
    "sizeable concentrations in tidal arms , many of which appear self - gravitating , have been found in  studies of a number of interacting galaxies , with typical  masses of @xmath87 , the resulting overall population of bound dwarf galaxies being perhaps half of all dwarfs ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "the formation of dwarf galaxies is predicted by computer simulations of galaxy interaction , such as those by barnes & hernquist ( 1992 ) , and the more complete model , including gas dynamics , by barnes & hernquist ( 1996 ) . in models , self - gravitation of some material ejected in tidal arms , may be enough to overcome expansion of the arm over time , forming bound objects .",
    "these tend to be gas - rich since their gas and stars have slightly different origins , with the gas being more compact and so surviving tidal disruption .",
    "frequently a number of bound objects are produced , generally in the outer parts of the tail , due to the lower mass needed to avoid disruption there .",
    "elmegreen et al .  (",
    "1993 ) used computer models of ic  2163/ngc  2207 to show that extended disks of gas can lead to a massive concentration of gas at the end of a tidal arm during interaction .",
    "they also showed that if the mass of the second galaxy is similar to , or larger than , the host galaxy , then eventually massive clouds can be ejected from the host galaxy , leading to self - gravitating dwarf galaxies like those observed by the same authors using vla  observations . according to elmegreen et al . , the lack of an extended gas distribution in the models of barnes & hernquist ( 1992 ) , prevented the gas pool forming in their simulations . with the antennae galaxies merging , and of apparently similar masses , they should be sufficient to produce a pool along a tail , or attached or detached dwarf galaxies .",
    "the galaxy eso  572g045 is much smaller and less massive than the antennae and is classified as a spiral dwarf galaxy .",
    "it has an  radial velocity @xmath88 , similar to that of the southern tidal tail , and a small apparent distance from it .",
    "the association between eso  572g045 and the antennae could be found by searching it for signs of recent interaction ( e.g.  starburst activity ) .",
    "if this has not occurred then almost certainly the dwarf is not involved in the antennae merger .",
    "if interaction has occurred , then either the dwarf was a pre - existing galaxy now tidally disturbed , or it is a bound object produced from tidal debris from the merger ( e.g.  elmegreen et al .  1993 ; hernquist 1992 , 1996 ) . given its apparent spiral structure , creation from debris appears a less likely explanation . with an  mass alone of @xmath59 ,",
    "its mass would be at the high end for bound objects ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ) , but still reasonable .",
    "unfortunately , to date there is no available information which would resolve this question .",
    "the small size of the object relative to the beam allows only an approximate dynamical mass estimate from  velocities .",
    "it is edge - on , hence its maximum rotational velocity is half of the  range ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the corresponding radius appears to be @xmath90 ( 3 ) .",
    "the following equation ( giovanelli & haynes 1988 ) estimates the total enclosed mass , assuming a spherical distribution :    @xmath91    from which we derive a dynamical mass of @xmath92 .",
    "these estimates imply that  makes up about 8% of the dwarf s mass , roughly in the range observed in larger spiral galaxies , and supporting the suggestion of spiral structure .",
    "the inner - most distance from the center of a globular cluster or orbiting satellite , at which tidal stripping occurs , is the tidal radius ( @xmath93 ) , which we take as the jacobi limit :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the total mass of the satellite , @xmath96 that of the parent galaxy and @xmath97 their separation ( see e.g.  pisano & wilcots 2000 ) . taking the velocity minima and maxima as the extreme velocities in the antennae disks , and the  peak as the center of mass , leads to projected rotation velocity of @xmath98 at a radius of @xmath99 , and a very rough antennae disk mass estimate of @xmath100 . treating eso  572g045 as a satellite of the antennae disks ( @xmath101  kpc ) gives a tidal radius of @xmath102   kpc , much larger than its measured radius .",
    "so it is unlikely that eso  572g045 is prone to disruption .",
    "the antennae starburst is optically spectacular and has a total infrared luminosity of @xmath103 indicating major starburst activity .",
    "however , gao et al .",
    "( 2001 ) concluded that the starburst is modest considering the high molecular gas content of the system ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "computer models of the antennae have shown that it may result from the prograde encounter of two disk galaxies .",
    "this has been found ( e.g.  for the non - merging case , by mihos et al .",
    "1991 ) to generally produce the strongest starburst . in the same study",
    ", closer encounters also strengthen the starburst at least for non - mergers . the antennae encounter and",
    "the starburst within it thus agrees with the available models .",
    "mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) modelled star formation patterns in merging pairs of disk galaxies , concluding that galaxies with large bulges would delay their major starburst activity until the final stages of merger . at this point",
    "a combined central gas pool would produce vigorous starbursts ( and a high infrared luminosity ) . from our  studies",
    "it appears that such a pool of cool gas is forming in the antennae .",
    "these observations suggest that the antennae are an example of the delayed action for bulge galaxies modelled by mihos & hernquist , with the current starburst being an early stage , and that the scene is being set for a fairly spectacular final merger of the disks at a later date .",
    "our  images of the antennae have higher sensitivity and resolution than those by van der hulst ( 1979 ) , revealing more  mass and structure as well as some new features not previously observed .",
    "our radio continuum images include the first published 13  image , and a new 20  image corresponding to previously published ones by condon ( 1983 , 1987 ) and hummel & van der hulst ( 1986 ) .",
    "no continuum polarisation has been detected .",
    "the radio continuum maps closely resemble the  maps by amram et al .",
    "the distribution approximates the optical star - forming regions , e.g.  seen in hst images .",
    "sources in the overlap region match the locations of giant molecular clouds seen in co by stanford et al .",
    "these similarities suggest that the continuum results largely from star formation .",
    "the lack of continuum emission in the tidal tails indicates that recent and on - going star formation in the antennae is basically confined to the disks .",
    "the presence of a central  gas pool along with a modest disk starburst ( gao et al .  2001 ) and computer simulations ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) suggest that the current starburst may be a weak precursor to a far larger one occuring much later in the merger .    the southern tidal tail contains abundant  mass ( ) , similar to the galactic disks ( ) , but less concentrated .",
    "this tail is connected smoothly to the disks , although  diagrams show a clear breakaway point at 1590 .",
    "definite  clumps exist along the tail s length .",
    "it has a substantial  width of up to @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) , larger than the optical width .",
    "there is no spatial displacement between optical and emission .",
    "the tip of the southern tail contains a large  concentration containing @xmath51 or @xmath52 of the tail s . at this point",
    "the tail also bends sharply both in terms of velocity and shape , and the column density is higher by a factor of @xmath106 .",
    "this coincides in position with the young tidal dwarf galaxy , observed optically by mirabel et al .",
    "dwarf galaxies have previously been produced as a tidal feature by computer simulations , along with pools of material at the ends of tidal arms ( barnes & hernquist 1992 , 1996 ; elmegreen 1993 ) , and they have also been observed in other interacting galaxies ( e.g.  duc & mirabel 1994 , 1998 ) . although it is not known that any of the  pool in the antennae is associated with the dwarf , it appears likely they are associated , as seen in the simulations .",
    "the smaller northern tail contains only  of and has no detectable  connection to the disks , which may be partly due to ionisation effects suggested by hibbard , vacca & yun ( 2000 ) .",
    "this tail s  extends much further lengthwise than its starlight , unlike the southern tail , and it curves toward the west along a faint extension newly detected in our  data and not visible optically .",
    "the central , while it follows broadly the outline of the optical disks , has a detailed velocity structure and spatial distribution which bear no close resemblance to those normally observed in disks .",
    "the  appears to have been so kinematically disturbed that it is largely decoupled from the stellar component .",
    "the overall velocity range is a high @xmath107 and the is substantially pooled in the region between the disks , peaking midway between them , unlike optical images .",
    "while generally there is only one velocity component along the line - of - sight , part of the disk , close to the southern nucleus , contains two components and thus a high dispersion , up to 150 .",
    "comparison of  mass measurements to previous co measurements by wilson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and gao et al .",
    "( 2001 ) gives an estimated molecular - to - atomic gas ratio of @xmath74 for the whole system .",
    "the difference between the physical sizes and  contents of the tails , suggests a difference in structure or gas content between the two progenitor galaxies , although asymmetry in the encounter geometry may be responsible .",
    "our  images also show the nearby dwarf galaxy eso  572g045 , which is south - west of the end of the southern tail , and @xmath091  kpc from the antennae centre .",
    "the  matches the optical appearance of the galaxy , an edge - on disk @xmath01  in width . using the  velocity field we estimate a systemic velocity of @xmath61 and a rotational velocity of @xmath89 , resulting in a dynamic mass of @xmath92 , compared to an  mass of @xmath59 .",
    "this gives an 8%   content which appears reasonable .",
    "the  mass of eso  572g045 is 3% that of the antennae .",
    "the dwarf s closeness , and quite similar velocity , to the adjoining southern tail of the antennae , indicates that it is a companion galaxy .",
