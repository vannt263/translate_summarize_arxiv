    ", @xmath150 , @xmath88.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the shift of the phase boundary for the magnetic phase transition in the kmc model to significantly larger values of @xmath100 provides room for the qsh * phase predicted to emerge from the interplay of strong spin - orbit coupling and strong electron - electron interaction in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the qsh phase undergoes a transition to the qsh * phase at sufficiently large values of the spin - orbit coupling upon increasing the hubbard interaction @xcite .",
    "while the model for @xmath1 includes a rashba spin - orbit term that does not conserve spin @xcite , mean - field calculations suggest that such an interaction is not essential for the existence of the qsh * phase , and that this phase could also exist in the kmh model @xcite .",
    "its absence in numerical results for the kmh model may therefore be due to the onset of magnetic order already at intermediate values of @xmath100 .",
    "( similar to the qsh phase , the qsh * phase relies on time - reversal symmetry , and can therefore not coexist with magnetism . ) because the onset of magnetic order is shifted to stronger interactions , the kmc model can in principle provide a more favorable setting to observe this exotic phase .",
    "because the qsh * phase is not adiabatically connected to the qsh phase of the km model , we expect this phase to manifest itself in terms of an additional phase transition . while a closing of the single - particle gap is not generally necessary in correlated systems , we still expect such a transition to leave a signature in the evolution of the gap with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "however , the results for the single - particle gap of the kmc model shown in fig .  [ fig : spgap_lambda0.2](a ) are qualitatively the same as for the kmh model , and can be reproduced at the mean - field level @xcite .",
    "the single - particle gap remains nonzero throughout the qsh phase , and shows a single cusp at the critical point of the magnetic transition .",
    "similarly , and as in the case of @xmath92 , the free - energy derivative with respect to the interaction shows a continuous evolution as a function of @xmath6 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spgap_lambda0.2](b ) .",
    "finally , because the qsh * phase is expected to be located between the qsh and the mi phase , it would change the universality class of the magnetic transition , the latter being a qsh*-mi transition instead of a qsh - mi transition .",
    "the scaling collapse obtained with the 3d xy critical exponents in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling_lambda0.2](c ) hence contradicts the existence of an intermediate phase .",
    "finally , the response to @xmath163 fluxes could be used to measure the @xmath39 topological invariant as a function of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we have studied the kane - mele model with long - range coulomb interaction using an auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo method .",
    "the phase diagram shows the same phases and phase transitions as for the kane - mele - hubbard model , namely a semimetal , a quantum spin hall phase , and an antiferromagnetic mott insulator .",
    "most notably , the magnetic transition is shifted to significantly larger onsite interactions ( in addition to the nonlocal part ) compared to a hubbard interaction .",
    "this shift can be understood as originating from the competition between charge and spin order , with charge fluctuations being enhanced by the nonlocal interactions .",
    "the phase transitions between the semimetal and the antiferromagnetic insulator in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , and between the quantum spin hall insulator and the antiferromagnetic insulator in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , were analyzed with regard to the critical behavior . in both cases ,",
    "the critical exponents appear to be the same as for the hubbard interaction , namely those of the gross - neveu and the 3d xy universality class , respectively .",
    "this observation agrees with analytical findings regarding the marginal irrelevance of the long - range interaction .",
    "compared to the case of a hubbard interaction , the problem with long - range interactions is more challenging .",
    "consequently , the finite - size extrapolations and critical values are less accurate .",
    "finally , we did not find any evidence for additional phases .",
    "our results suggest that apart from quantitative differences , the hubbard repulsion captures the essential physics associated with strong correlations . unfortunately , because of a minus - sign problem , our method can not be applied to models with dominant nearest or next - nearest neighbor interactions which may support additional symmetry - breaking phases @xcite .",
