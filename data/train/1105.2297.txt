    "deep hubble space telescope ( hst ) legacy fields , such as the hubble ultra - deep field ( hudf ; * ? ? ? * ) or goods @xcite , and wide area ground - based imaging , have made it possible to study the evolution of the uv luminosity function ( lf ) across @xmath16 to great accuracy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this is essential for estimating the contribution of galaxies to cosmic reionization .",
    "one of the most important conclusions from these studies is thus the realization that the uv luminosity density ( ld ) emitted by the galaxy population gradually falls towards higher redshifts .",
    "for example , the ld of the @xmath18 galaxy population is about an order of magnitude larger than that of the @xmath12 population , about 1.5 gyr earlier .",
    "how this evolves to even higher redshifts is still very unclear .",
    "a sizable galaxy population at @xmath19 is expected based on the first estimates of stellar population ages of @xmath20 galaxies , indicating that these sources very likely started forming stars already at @xmath21 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is still somewhat uncertain due to possible nebular line emission contaminating the spitzer photometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , an early epoch of star - formation is also required by the mean redshift of reionization as measured by wmap ( @xmath22 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if galaxies are assumed to be the main drivers for this process .",
    "however , previous searches for @xmath19 sources in the pre - wfc3 era only resulted in very small samples of relatively low reliability candidates , none of which have been confirmed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is mainly due to the extreme faintness of the @xmath0 galaxy population .",
    "not only are these galaxies fainter due to their increased distance , but also they are expected at intrinsically lower luminosities . additionally , the detection of such high - redshift sources is further complicated by the fact that they are invisible in optical data . due to the highly neutral inter - galactic medium before the end of cosmic reionization , their uv photons",
    "are absorbed shortward of the redshifted ly@xmath23  line , which shifts to @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "thus , these sources can only be seen in the nir , where previous detectors were significantly lagging behind optical technology .    with 40@xmath26 higher efficiency relative to nicmos to detect high redshift galaxies in the nir , wfc3/ir has the potential to change this and to push galaxy studies to beyond @xmath27 . several deep and wide area wfc3/ir data sets have been taken already and several more are upcoming .",
    "the challenge for identifying genuine @xmath28 sources in these data sets , is that these galaxies will only be visible in one band ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this has already led to some controversy in the first searches for @xmath0 sources in the first - epoch wfc3/ir data over the hubble ultra deep field ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in our recent analysis , which includes the full two - year wfc3/ir data over the hudf as well as the shallower , but wider early release science ( ers ) data , @xcite found only one single galaxy candidate detected at @xmath29 with an estimated redshift at @xmath30 . given that about three should have been detected , if the evolution of the lf continued as extrapolated from the trends established across @xmath31 to @xmath15 , this provided first tentative evidence for an accelerated evolution in the galaxy population from @xmath12 to @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we significantly expand on our first @xmath0 analysis from wfc3/ir data presented in @xcite by extending the search to all the deep wfc3/ir fields in the chandra deep - field south area that have since become available .",
    "the inclusion of the two deep hudf09 parallel fields is especially useful , since both reach just @xmath32 mag shallower than the ultra - deep hudf field but triple the search area for @xmath33 ab mag sources .",
    "additionally , we use different analysis tools developed by the first author that provide an independent analysis of the hudf and ers data . while the lyman - break approach is similar in principle to that of @xcite the use of independently tested software and procedures for the source detection and its analysis provides confirmation and validation .",

    "such sources are typically detected in the irac data .",
    "alternatively , the solid and dashed green lines show possible seds of @xmath75 galaxies which could escape the irac detection at @xmath76 .",

    "note that much larger amounts of dust can be hidden for interloper galaxies at the detection limit of the hudf ( green solid , @xmath77 mag ) than for the ers ( green dashed , @xmath78 mag ) .",
    "thus even with irac it can be a challenge to separate real @xmath79 sources from lower redshift contaminants . ]",
    "galaxies at @xmath80 are expected to exhibit very red @xmath72 colors since the redshifted , strong ly@xmath23  absorption ( by the predominantly neutral inter - galactic hydrogen ) cuts into the flux in the @xmath7 filter ( see figure [ fig : colsel ] ) .",
    "this makes such high redshift galaxies completely invisible blueward of @xmath7 , and we use this fact for their identification .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : colsel ] , however , also passively evolving or dusty galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath81 ) can exhibit similarly red colors in @xmath72 . while the requirement of optical non - detections removes the bulk of lower redshift contamination , certain intermediate redshift galaxies with evolved or dusty stellar populations can still be included due to the fact that the optical data does not reach deep enough , if at similar depth as the ir ( see fig .

    "deep spitzer irac data provides a way to identify contaminating galaxies .",
    "these are expected to exhibit very red @xmath82 $ ] colors , which discriminates them from genuine @xmath0 candidates .    to exclude possible low - redshift contamination , we thus use two steps to select @xmath5 galaxy candidates .",
    "for the first step , the primary criteria are based on hst data only : @xmath83 @xmath84 additional to excluding objects that are detected in any band blueward of @xmath7 at more than @xmath76 , we include a cut in the optical @xmath85 value of a galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is computed from the @xmath70 radius aperture fluxes as @xmath86 , where the sum runs over all the bands available in the given data set blueward of @xmath7 , i.e. it includes all the available optical data as well as the nir band @xmath45 for the hudf09 data , and @xmath44 in the ers .",
    "the relatively large apertures were chosen in order sample @xmath87 of the light of point - like sources .",
    "the limiting @xmath88 are derived from photometric scatter simulations .",
    "they are set to exclude the majority of interlopers which remain undetected at @xmath76 purely due to photometric noise , but not to cut a substantial fraction of galaxies with real zero flux in the optical bands .",
    "the scatter simulations utilize all galaxies in our catalogs that are @xmath89 mag above the completeness limit , applying photometric gaussian noise from 1 mag fainter sources . from these simulations",
    "it is clear that contamination is mainly an issue at 0.75 mag above the completeness limits , but that @xmath90% of contaminants can be eliminated by using a @xmath85 limit of @xmath91 or 2.4 , for 5 filters or 4 filters , respectively . in the hudf09 data , the resulting number of expected contaminants due to photometric scatter is thus reduced from @xmath32 source per wfc3/ir field to @xmath92 source .    on the other hand ,",
    "the adopted @xmath88 limits do remove an additional @xmath93% of sources with real zero flux , simply due to gaussian statistics .",

    "we note , however , that contamination from similar galaxies with less extreme colors ( which may be more abundant also at @xmath132 mag ) may still be non - negligible due to photometric scatter ( see also  [ sec : additionalcontamin ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that it is very difficult to construct clean @xmath0 galaxy samples purely based on hst data alone .",
    "even if we were to increase the color criteria to @xmath133 , there would still be two contaminating galaxies in the sample together with our only viable @xmath0 candidate .",

    "this will be less of a concern for future @xmath27 galaxy samples , which can be obtained , e.g. , based on new f140w filter data .",
    "in such a data set intrinsically red galaxies can be sorted out by requiring a blue continuum across f140w and @xmath4 .      here , we only give a brief summary of the possible sample contamination . for a thorough discussion",

    "[ fig : ldevol ] we also show the luminosity densities at @xmath213 mag as derived from the semi - analytical model ( sam ) of @xcite , and from the theoretical model of @xcite .",
    "although there is still some discrepancy on the exact shape of the @xmath214 uv lf between the @xcite sam and the observations , the integrated luminosity density and its evolution is remarkably well reproduced across the full redshift range @xmath11 ( see also discussion in * ? ? ?",

    "however , the model reproduces our estimates of the @xmath0 ld remarkably well .",
    "similar conclusions are reached for the purely theoretical model of @xcite . in particular , this model predicts the uv ld to evolve at an accelerated rate at @xmath130 , being only @xmath215 erg@xmath208s@xmath47hz@xmath47mpc@xmath186 at @xmath0 , in excellent agreement with our observed estimates . since the model is only based on the evolution of the underlying dark matter mass function , this indicates that an accelerated evolution in the galaxy population can be explained even without the need for a change in the physical mechanisms of galaxy formation .",
    "for further theoretical model predictions , see also e.g. @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the star - formation rate densities ( see table [ tab : summary ] ) inferred from our data , are more than an order of magnitude too low to account for the stellar mass densities observed at @xmath105 in systems of similar brightness . with constant star - formation over @xmath216 myr from @xmath0 to @xmath105 the observed galaxy population would only produce a stellar mass density of @xmath217mpc@xmath186 , compared to @xmath218mpc@xmath186 as estimated by , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "rather , these galaxies are found to have best - fit photometric redshifts in the range @xmath222 ( see section [ sec : contaminants ] and appendix ) .",
    "they remain undetected in the optical due to their evolved stellar populations with non - negligible dust obscuration .",

    "this is @xmath190 mag brighter than the detection limits of our bright surveys , which suggests that such evolved and dusty galaxies follow a peaked luminosity function at these wavelengths .",
    "if confirmed by future wide - area wfc3/ir data sets , this would indicate that such extremely red systems are not as much of a problem for @xmath28 searches at fainter levels as has been expected to date .",
    "however , the existence of such galaxy populations will make it challenging to use large - area wfc3 surveys such as pure - parallel fields ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) for constraining the bright end of the @xmath0 uv lf without additional follow - up observations to validate the candidates .",
    "even with our expanded search area , the only @xmath224 detected galaxy with a color limit of @xmath101<1.6 $ ] ( @xmath76 ) and thus the only possible @xmath0 galaxy candidate is the same source that we reported already in @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ sec : possiblez10 ] we additionally note one other lower s / n candidate that is suggestive of being at comparable redshift , but requires confirmation from further hst wfc3/ir data .    interestingly , we would have expected to detect six @xmath0 galaxies in our data , if the uv lf evolved to @xmath0 as expected from lower redshift trends ( see  [ sec : nexp ] ) .",
    "thus , the galaxy population appears to evolve at an accelerated rate beyond @xmath130 .",
    "we infer that the uv luminosity density increases by more than an order of magnitude in only 170 myr from @xmath0 to @xmath12 , and we are thus likely witnessing the first massive build - up of the galaxy population at these early epochs in the reionization era . the fact that theoretical models based on the evolution of dark matter halos do , in fact , predict such an accelerated increase in the ld , indicates that these rapid changes are mainly driven by an accelerated evolution of the underlying dark matter mass function , rather than due to a change in star - formation properties of these early galaxies ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the accelerated evolution of the galaxy population also has interesting consequences for cosmic reionization by galaxies brighter than @xmath225 mag , the current detection limits .",
    "with such a sharp decrease in the luminosity density above @xmath12 , it is impossible for such bright galaxies alone to create a reionization history in agreement with the high optical depth measurement of wmap and the vast majority of the ionizing flux has to be created by fainter galaxies ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unfortunately , our knowledge of galaxies at @xmath130 still remains very uncertain .",
    "however , wfc3/ir offers unique opportunities to make significant progress in expanding the number of galaxies at @xmath79 and addressing some of the key issues related to early galaxy formation and its impact on reionization , even before the advent of jwst . in figure",

    "such future data sets will have to reach significantly fainter than @xmath226 mag to accomplish this goal , even for large surveyed areas of 50 wfc3/ir fields .",
    "this is deeper than currently planned wide - area wfc3/ir data ( including mct programs ) .",
    "in fact , to characterize the luminosity function at luminosities below l@xmath227 and to set better constraints for reionization , surveys to fainter than 29 ab mag are really needed .",
    "note that with only one wfc3/ir field , a magnitude of @xmath228 has to be reached to detect a significant @xmath0 population , which is fainter than is practical with hst .",
    "based on the current lf constraints , we find that imaging a few fields provides the best chance to improve on current @xmath0 constraints .",
    "furthermore , in order to further constrain the possible accelerated evolution of the uv lf , the @xmath27 regime offers the best opportunity .",
    "a sizable population of @xmath27 galaxies is expected to be seen already down to @xmath229 mag over multiple wfc3/ir fields , which can be achieved with the efficient f140w filter .",
    "thus , it is likely that already with wfc3/ir , we can soon push the frontier of statistical galaxy samples with wfc3/ir from @xmath12 another @xmath230 myr back out to @xmath79 .",
    "galaxies ( blue shaded region and dashed line ) and ten @xmath0 galaxies ( red shaded region and dashed line ) as a function of survey area .",

    "here we briefly summarize the properties of the galaxies that formally met the @xmath7-dropout criteria based on the hst data alone , but which were found to exhibit very red @xmath4 to irac colors .",

    "the best estimate for its color is @xmath101=1.6\\pm0.5 $ ] , which is too red for a likely @xmath28 source .",
    "interestingly , six of these 16 sources are present in catalogs of potential passive high redshift galaxies of @xcite and @xcite",
    ". one of these is also detected in x - ray emission and classified as a so - called exo source hosting a potentially highly obscured agn , particularly if it is an evolved galaxy at intermediate redshift , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "we have derived photometric redshifts and mass estimates for these galaxies by complementing our hst photometry with the irac fluxes from the goods music catalog @xcite or from the simple images . based on sed fits with @xcite models ,",

    "the rapid disappearance of such sources beyond @xmath235 , almost one mag brighter than the detection limits of our shallow fields from ers and candels , suggests that such sources may have a peaked lf at the wavelengths of interest in these surveys and so could be less of a problem for contamination for fainter @xmath0 galaxy samples . ]    in figure [ fig : contaminmz ] we additionally show the surface density of these evolved intermediate redshift sources . even at their peak surface density ,",

    "the dearth of such galaxies faintward of @xmath237 , at @xmath190 mag brighter than the completeness limit of our bright surveys , suggests that such extremely red sources become even less frequent ( i.e. , that their lf may have peaked at these magnitudes ) and so they could be less problematic for contamination of fainter @xmath19 dropout searches .",
