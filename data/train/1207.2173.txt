    "although the concept of the poynting vector has been known for well over a century,@xcite the actual flow of electromagnetic energy in even the simplest three - dimensional ohmic circuit is a subject of ongoing interest.@xcite in this paper we calculate the electric and magnetic fields generated by a circular circuit carrying a steady current , and obtain the poynting vector @xmath0 representing the flow of electromagnetic energy in the space surrounding the circuit .",
    "we shall show that the energy flows through every point in space while traveling from the battery to the wire , and yet the net flow of energy into the resistor equals the energy generated by the battery .",
    "the idea that electromagnetic energy flowing from a battery to a resistor in a simple circuit travels through the surrounding space rather than through the wires is counterintuitive.@xcite the calculation of the poynting vector field also poses computational challenges when applied to a realistic three - dimensional circuit .",
    "although realistic three - dimensional geometries have not been considered in detail , the case of a circuit consisting of an infinitely long shaft , which reduces the problem to two dimensions , has been treated with success.@xcite it was shown that the magnetic field vanishes outside the circuit , and hence the poynting vector vanishes as well . therefore , for a two - dimensional geometry the energy flow is totally confined within the circuit .",
    "figure  [ fig : daviskaplanfig01 ] shows the two - dimensional section of the circuit studied in ref .  .",
    "the battery , resistors , and wire are taken to be infinite in extent perpendicular to the plane of the figure .",
    "the arrows show the direction of the flow of electromagnetic energy , which is the poynting vector field .",
    "the energy flows from the battery to the two resistors , the flow being entirely contained within the interior space of the rectangular shaft .",
    "however , the three - dimensional problem is qualitatively different from the two - dimensional one , because in the former @xmath1 is no longer confined within the space defined by the circuit.@xcite        a related study examined the fields and energy flow in circuits where the two - dimensional cross section is a circle.@xcite figure  [ fig : daviskaplanfig02 ] shows the equipotential lines for such a circuit .",
    "these lines also represent the direction of @xmath1 , but only the lines in the interior of the circuit , because @xmath1 vanishes on the outside . finally , ref .   explored the distribution of charge in a coaxial circuit with a battery on the outer cylinder and a resistor on the inner cylinder and showed that @xmath1 is nonzero only within the space between the two cylinders . because of the peculiar shape of the circuit considered in ref .  , the results are not typical of a realistic circuit .",
    "thus the idealized circuits studied in the literature share the feature that the poynting vector is confined to the geometrical space of the circuit .",
    "hernandes and assis@xcite have done a detailed treatment of a circuit in the form of a torus ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : daviskaplanfig03 ] ) .",
    "these authors calculated the electric fields inside and outside as well as the surface charge distribution on the conductor .",
    "the problem of finding the electric field due to a conductor carrying a steady current  `` merzbacher s puzzle''@xcite  has aroused much interest.@xcite        although ref .",
    "did not consider the magnetic field , their work is important for our purposes because an exact solution was provided for the electric field due to a three - dimensional ohmic circuit consisting of a battery driving a current through a resistor .",
    "given the exact solution for a circuit in the shape of a toroid , hernandes and assis allowed the toroid to collapse to a ring - shaped wire whose thickness is small compared to the diameter of the ring .",
    "they thus obtained an expression for the surface charge density in a circular circuit made of a wire of small thickness .",
    "we shall calculate the surface charge density using a different method , and we will find that in the limit as the radius of the wire approaches zero , our result is in agreement with theirs.@xcite    in this paper we will consider a circuit in the shape of a ring with a battery of negligible size and a wire of uniform resistance per unit length ( see fig .  [ fig : daviskaplanfig05 ] ) .",
    "we shall obtain expressions for the corresponding electric and magnetic fields , and plot @xmath1 inside and outside the circuit .",
    "we will show that @xmath1 of a simple circuit is not confined to the space within the circuit , and spans the space outside the circuit as well , even though the magnitude of @xmath1 decreases as the sixth power of the distance from the circuit .",
    "the exact value of @xmath1 at an arbitrary point inside or outside the circuit can be obtained only by numerical integration .",
    "it will be shown analytically that the total amount of energy flowing from the battery into the wire equals the potential difference between the ends of the battery multiplied by the current flowing through the wire .    for a dc circuit consisting of a battery of constant emf and a thin wire of uniform resistance ,",
    "it has been shown that charges develop all along the wire from one terminal of the battery to the other , and that the charge per unit length of the wire is a linear function of the distance from the battery.@xcite the charge density calculation will allow us to obtain the electric field and hence the poynting vector associated with the circuit .",
    "we first obtain an expression for the surface charge density @xmath2 on the wire .",
    "to this end we shall assume that the radius of the wire @xmath3 is much smaller than the radius @xmath4 of the circuit .",

    "we now apply these results to a circuit in the form of a circle of radius @xmath4 .",

    "we have @xmath54 which in the limit of a thin wire , @xmath55 has the leading behavior @xmath56 this limiting form agrees with the thin wire limit of the result in ref .   for the surface charge density on a toroidal conductor carrying a steady current .",
    "we next obtain limiting expressions for the poynting vector very close to the wire , i.e. , at distances small compared to the wire circumference @xmath57 . for such calculations the curvature of the circuit becomes negligible , and we may approximate the circuit by an infinitely long cylindrical conductor .",
    "we previously made such an approximation in determining the field parallel to the wire to obtain an expression for the surface charge density .",
