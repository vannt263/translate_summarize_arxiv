    "by various reasons , parametrization of @xmath5 in qcd processes has always been among the qcd topics on discussion . in particular ,",
    "the early summaries on the situation in the hard processes were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and one of the latest summaries is ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) that in the feynman graphs contributing to scattering amplitudes in the hard kinematics , as well as to the sudakov form - factors , the parametrization of @xmath5 is universal and simple : @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the transverse momentum of the soft gluon momenta .",
    "this parametrization is also used in the dglap equations in the integral form and leads to the parametrization @xmath8 in the differential dglap equations . besides this example , there are other cases where it is important to know the parametrization of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , the parton distributions @xmath9 and some other objects are often obtained through composing and solving the evolution equations of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) type , with one intermediate gluon factorized .",
    "naturally , such equations can be different and can be derived by different ways . in particular ,",
    "both dglap and bfkl equations belong to this group .",
    "we do not consider obtaining those equations in the present paper .",
    "instead , our goal is to consider the treatment of @xmath5 in bs equations in general .",
    "the parametrization of @xmath5 in the bs equations was discussed in ref .  @xcite . in the much more detailed way",
    "the treatment of @xmath5 in the bs equations was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite where the parametrization @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the longitudinal moment fraction ( see eq .",
    "( [ sud ] ) ) , was derived . in principle",
    ", the parametrization ( [ alfads ] ) looks natural and well - expected from the preceeding estimates , however the method of ref .",
    "@xcite includes serious contradictions which make the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ alfads ] ) unreliable . in the present paper",
    "we consider the parametrization of @xmath5 in the bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "we show what was the mistake done in ref .",
    "@xcite and correct it . as a result , we obtain a more complicated expression for the effective coupling in the bs equations .",
    "then we demonstrate that when the lowest limit of integration over @xmath1 is large enough , the effective coupling can be simplified down to @xmath12 .",
    "earlier , in ref .  @xcite we argued that one of the easiest ways of treating @xmath5 in the bs equation could be the use of the mellin transform .",
    "nevertheless by various reasons , for example for monte - carlo simulations@xcite and for performing the numerical calculations in the way convenient for experimentalists@xcite , one may prefer not to involve this operation . to this end , in the present paper we examine the treatment of @xmath5 in the bethe - salpeter equations without using the mellin transform .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we remind how the parametrization of @xmath5 in the hard kinematics , i.e. eq .  ( [ aperp ] ) , can be obtained .",
    "we suggest in sect .",
    "iii the way to derive the parametrization of @xmath5 in the bs equations for the scattering amplitudes in the forward kinematics . due to the optical theorem the parton distributions are proportional to the imaginary parts of the forward amplitudes .",
    "it allows us to fix in sect .",
    "iv the @xmath5 -parametrization in the bs equations for the parton distributions .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v is for concluding remarks .",
    "from the technical point of view , calculation of qcd processes in the hard kinematics is much easier compared to the regge kinematics , so to begin with we remind known results for the parametrization of @xmath5 for the hard processes .",
    "let us consider the contribution @xmath13 of the feynman graph depicted in fig .",
    "1 . it correspond to a certain factorization of the soft virtual gluon with momentum @xmath14 propagating in the @xmath15 -channel .",
    "the cases with @xmath16 and @xmath17 -channel gluons factorized can be considered quite similarly . in the present paper",
    "we do not discuss the factorization but focus on the treatment of @xmath5 only .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "1 denote quarks , though the generalization to the case of gluons is obvious . through the paper",
    "we will assume that the lower particles , with momenta @xmath18 , have small virtualities @xmath19 whereas virtualities of the upper partons , with momenta @xmath20 are large : @xmath21 .",
    "this assumption allows us to extend our analysis , with minor changes , to dis and dvcs . applying the feynman rules to fig .  1",
    "we obtain : @xmath22[(p - k)^2 + \\imath \\epsilon ] } m(s , q^2 , ( p - k)^2 , ( q+k)^2 ) 4 \\pi \\frac{\\alpha_s ( k^2)}{k^2 + \\imath \\epsilon}.\\ ] ] factor @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ ms ] ) appears from simplifying the numerator .",
    "we have denoted @xmath24 and assume that @xmath25 and any of the involved masses .",
