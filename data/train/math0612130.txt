    "we also construct an exotic _ symplectic _ structure on @xmath1 , the first known such symplectic example .",
    "our approach is different from the recent constructions in the sense that we do not use any rational - blowdown surgery ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the techniques used in our construction are the symplectic fiber sum operation ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the symplectic cohomology @xmath13 @xcite , the recent construction of the author .",
