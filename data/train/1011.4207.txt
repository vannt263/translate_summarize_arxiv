    "such predictions give rather good description of the experimental data , however , the theoretical uncertainties are quite large which makes the situation somewhat clouded and prevents definite conclusions .",
    "some time ago we have studied kinematical correlations of @xmath5 quarks @xcite , which is , however , difficult to study experimentally .",
    "high luminosity and in a consequence better statistics at present colliders gives a new possibility to study not only inclusive distributions but also correlations between outgoing particles ( meson - meson , meson - electron or electron - electron ) .",
    "kinematical correlations constitute an alternative method to pin down the cross section for charm and bottom production .",
    "it gives also a great possibility to separate charm and bottom contributions which has a crucial meaning for understanding the character of heavy quarks interactions with the matter created in high energy nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-factorization method is very useful to study correlations between @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 from the drell - yan processes @xcite . in our calculations",
    "we take under consideration not only leptons from open charm / bottom decays but also leptons produced in drell - yan proccess , as well as leptons coming from elastic and inelastic processes initiated by photon - photon fusion . in the case of elastic reaction",
    "we follow exact momentum space calculations with 4-body phase space ( see e.g. @xcite ) and for inelastic scattering we have applied unique ( collinear ) photon distributions in the nucleon mrst2004 @xcite .",
    "the electrons from semileptonic decays are produced in a three - stage process .",
    "the whole procedure can be written in the following schematic way : @xmath7 where the symbol @xmath8 denotes a generic convolution .",
    "the first term is responsible for production of heavy quarks / antiquarks ( see fig.[fig : inclusive ] ) .",
    "next step is the process of formation of heavy mesons and the last ingredient is semileptonic decay of heavy mesons to electrons / positrons .",
