    "schwinger equations allow to extract the leading infrared behavior analytically and the general non - perturbative behavior with moderate numerical effort but these equations , consisting of an infinite tower of coupled non - linear integral equations , have to be truncated in order to be manageable .",

    "[ new.dat ] are in agreement with the expected power behavior . the infrared critical exponent as calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath206 , thus has been verified : a corresponding ( numerical ) solution for non - vanishing momenta exists .",
    "the gluon dressing function is remarkably stable against changes of the volume and approaches more and more the expected power solution for small momenta . for the ghost dressing function one",
    "observes again deviations of the first points in the infrared : an extraction of the correct infrared critical exponent from the numerical solution for the ghost function is hardly possible . only some points come close to the analytical value of the continuum before the curve starts bending down again in the very infrared . for the extracted value of the running coupling in",
    "the infrared this leads to a distinct mismatch to what one is to expect on the basis of analytical results .    at first sight",
    "the fact that the power solution for the ghost dressing function could be not reproduced numerically to a reasonable precision may seem disappointing .",
    "nevertheless these numerical results themselves show that the ghost dressing function is highly infrared singular .",
    "this reflects the long - range correlation of ghosts in landau gauge .",
    "therefore one should expect the ghost dressing function to be the one affected most by a finite volume . on the contrary the gluon dressing function vanishes in the infrared and",
    "consequently it is much less affected by a finite volume .",
    "we expect the ghost dressing function together with the running coupling to approach more and more the correct power solution in the infrared as lattice spacings are decreased and lattice sizes are increased .    furthermore , we add a remark on the transversality of the gluon propagator as obtained in the bare vertex truncation scheme .",
    "of course , the full gluon propagator calculated from the complete gluon equation with fully dressed vertices in landau gauge is transversal due to slavnov  taylor identities .",
    "thus such a hypothetical solution would be independent of the form of the projector , _",
    "i.e. _ in our notation with the projector @xmath207 independent of the parameter @xmath123 .",
    "in practice , using bare vertices as in our truncation scheme this is certainly not the case .",
    "our numerical results for different values of the parameter @xmath123 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ proj.dat ] .",
    "although our solutions show the expected dependence on the form of the projector this dependence is not too drastic and in general the behaviour of these different solutions is very similar",

    "the points in the very infrared can not be connected by a smooth line any more .",
    "correspondingly this happens for the running coupling .",
    "based on the infrared analysis one might anticipate that @xmath120 should approach the value @xmath208 more and more as @xmath123 grows until there is a jump to the solution from @xmath209 to @xmath210 as the brown ",

    "the solution shown for @xmath66 is approached smoothly when @xmath123 approaches this limit .",
    "this clearly indicates that the solution @xmath210 might not exist at all if one removes the torus as a regulator .",
    "finally we compare our results to recent su(2 ) lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "as has already been stated above the ghost and gluon dressing functions from dyson - schwinger equations are independent from the numbers of colors at least to our level of truncation .",
    "the only caveat in comparing our results with the lattice ones is the adjustment of the momentum scale which is certainly different from the case of su(3 ) above . to get an appropriate momentum scale we therefore used the lattice result @xmath211 at @xmath212 as input .",
    "the two graphs in figure ( [ lattice.dat ] ) show that the main qualitative features , the vanishing of the gluon and the divergence of the ghost dressing functions in the infrared , are common properties of both , the lattice solutions and the one from dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "even the power @xmath213 of the gluon dressing function on the torus is very close to the one that can be extracted from the lattice fit to be @xmath125 .",
    "the main difference of both approaches lies in the medium energy region around one gev , where the dyson - schwinger solutions suffer from the missing two loop contributions that are certainly present in lattice monte - carlo simulations .",
    "in this paper we have presented numerical solutions of truncated systems of dyson ",
    "schwinger equations for the gluon and ghost propagators in landau gauge su(n ) yang  mills theories .",

    "the central result of this paper is : only one of these two possible infrared behaviors in a given truncation scheme can be matched to a numerical solution for non - vanishing momenta .    in a truncation scheme with a bare ghost - gluon vertex and a transverse projection of the ( truncated ) gluon equation",

    "this is true for any values @xmath96 and @xmath97 . of course",
    ", in a full treatment of the coupled ghost gluon system @xmath219 would be independent of momentum .",

    "so all three choices give the same logarithmic running in momentum as required to give the correct one loop scaling behaviour of the integral . in the infrared",

    "an important point when formulating the dyson ",
    "schwinger equations on the torus could be the treatment of the zero modes .",
    "in addition , on the torus an infrared analysis like the one in flat euclidean space - time is not possible , and one is left with the problem how the dressing functions behave at vanishing momenta .",
    "guided by the intuition that especially the long ranged modes should be affected by the finite volume we assume in the following @xmath228 just like in the continuum and @xmath229 if zero modes are neglected .",
    "phrased otherwise we assume that the zero modes are the missing ingredient to ensure the correct infinite volume limit for the torus results .",
    "therefore , if on tori of different volumes @xmath230 shows no sign of becoming divergent , the infrared enhancement seen in @xmath231 or in the flat space - time results has to be due to the torus zero modes of gluons and ghosts .",
    "therefore , in this appendix , we will show that the assumption @xmath232 does not lead to a contradiction in the equations on the torus if zero modes are neglected . to this end",
    "we focus on the truncation scheme without angular approximations .",

    "each of the expressions ( [ kernel_y1],[kernel_y2],[kernel_y3 ] ) is then the appropriate term for @xmath241 on the right hand side of the dyson - schwinger equations on the torus .",
    "clearly one observes , that only a finite ghost mode @xmath242 avoids trouble with divergencies .",
    "this is especially true for the kernel @xmath243 of the gluon loop , as @xmath244 is more singular than the simple pole , so this kernel vanishes for small momenta @xmath74 .",
    "the other two expressions ( [ kernel_y1 ] ) and ( [ kernel_y2 ] ) are finite .",
    "one is then left with the ambiguous quantities @xmath245 and @xmath246 which will be replaced by their integrals from zero to @xmath247 in the calculation at the end of this section .",
    "the arbitrarines of this procedure is considerably milded by the observation that any number plugged in for the trigonometric functions yields the same qualitative result at the end of this section .",
    "second , we take the limit @xmath248 , which on the torus is identical to @xmath249 . the ghost kernel @xmath250 alone would certainly diverge as @xmath249 , but taking into account the power law behaviour @xmath251 for the gluon dressing function the integrand is zero in this limit .",
    "this is valid for @xmath252 , which is in agreement with the infrared analysis in the continuum .",
    "we therefore may omit the points @xmath253 in the ghost equation .",
    "the situation is different in the gluon equation where the kernel of the ghost loop has a finite limit @xmath248 : @xmath254 .",

    "the integrands are then given by @xmath257 where the kernel @xmath243 is of no interest , as we know the gluon loop to be subleading in the infrared .",
    "clearly , the kernel @xmath258 of the ghost loop in the gluon equation is now singular for @xmath259 , corresponding to a vanishing gluon dressing function in the infrared .",
    "this result confirms our working hypothesis that the gluon mode @xmath260 is not affected by the finite volume of the torus .",
    "the integrand of the ghost equation is finite up to the point @xmath44 .",

    "the parts of the integrals from @xmath44 to an infrared matching point @xmath265 are carried out analytically , with the dressing functions in the integral beeing replaced by their leading infrared behaviour ( [ zabg ] ) @xmath266 the infrared analysis leads to fixed values @xmath120 and @xmath267 , so @xmath6 is left as a free parameter in the infrared expansion . for numerical reasons",
    "it is convenient to choose the subtraction points @xmath268 and @xmath168 to lie above the maximum of @xmath40 .",
    "the two input parameters that determine the renormalization point where we require the normalization conditions @xmath269 are then @xmath6 and the value the gluon dressing function at its subtraction point , _ i.e. _ @xmath169 .",
    "the equations are solved using the newton iteration method thereby generating values for the propagator functions .",
    "these are then plugged into the unsubtracted equations to obtain the respective values of the renormalization constants @xmath27 and @xmath112 for a given cutoff @xmath30 and a given renormalization scale @xmath31 which allows finally to determine the numerical solutions respecting the normalization conditions @xmath269 .",
