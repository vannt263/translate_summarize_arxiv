    "there is growing interest in type ib / c supernovae ( sne ) following the discovery of a subclass that display very broad - lined spectra , indicating the existence of ejecta expanding with velocity @xmath9 .",
    "models of the optical spectra and the light curves ( lcs ) of this high - velocity subclass , also called hypernovae ( hne , e.g. , @xcite ) , have concluded that these are the explosions of massive c+o stars , producing up to 10 times the kinetic energy of normal core - collapse sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is unclear why some hne are apparently associated with grbs , i.e. , sn 1998bw and grb 980425 , @xcite , sn 2003dh and grb 030329 @xcite , and sn 2003lw and grb 031203 @xcite , while others are not .",
    "the type ic sn 2002ap , discovered in m74 @xcite , is one of the nearest sne in recent years .",
    "its host galaxy has a distance modulus of only @xmath10 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for the latest review ) .",
    "@xcite measured the total extinction toward the sn with a high - resolution spectrum and concluded that @xmath11 .",
    "we adopt these values in this paper .",
    "early - time optical spectroscopy and photometry was published by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "most authors emphasized the spectral similarity to the broad - lined sn 1998bw and sn 1997ef .",
    "the early - time light curve ( lc ) , was much broader than that of the normal type ic sn 1994i , but was significantly fainter than that of sn 1998bw and peaked earlier .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper i ) presented early - time near - infrared ( nir ) and optical photometry , obtained with the magnum telescope . using the @xmath12 photometry",
    ", they built a well - sampled @xmath1 bolometric lc for sn 2002ap .",
    "nir photometry has also been reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite described the evolution of nir spectra , which were dominated by lines of intermediate - mass elements ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite modelled the early - time optical spectra and bolometric lc using 1-d codes .",
    "they concluded that sn 2002ap was the energetic explosion of a c+o star , having evolved from a star of 20 - 25 @xmath2 on the main sequence , and that it ejected @xmath5 2.5 @xmath2 material with a kinetic energy of @xmath5 @xmath13 ergs , including @xmath5 0.07 @xmath2 @xmath14ni .",
    "this places sn 2002ap at the low - mass low - energy end of hypernovae .",
    "they also constrained the explosion date to mjd 52300.0 @xmath15 0.5 days .",
    "we use the explosion date as the reference point for any sn epoch in this paper . based on observed limits in pre - discovery images",
    ", @xcite argued that the progenitor was either a single w - r star of main - sequence mass @xmath16 or more likely part of an interacting binary .",
    "sn 2002ap was also monitored in the radio @xcite , x - rays @xcite , and uv @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated quite a small energy in any relativistic material from the faintness of the radio .",
    "they addressed the material with velocities larger than the shock velocity ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "therefore , their results do not contradict the high energy obtained in the 1-d model for the bulk sn ejecta by @xcite , whose ejecta velocity distribution has a cut - off at 70,000 km  s@xmath18 . as a possible confirmation of this result , the shock velocity derived by @xcite from models of the radio and x - ray observations was also @xmath5 70,000 km  s@xmath18 .",
    "sn 2002ap was not apparently associated with a grb @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite discovered a polarized spectrum component that resembled the total flux spectrum but redshifted by @xmath19 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they proposed that this component is due to scattering from jet material .",
    "@xcite further suggested that the jet may be too baryon - contaminated to trigger a grb and that it was expanding almost freely and hence was radio quiet .",
    "@xcite reproduced a bump in the lc of the xrf 030723 afterglow with a sn 2002ap - like lc .",
    "sn 2002ap was monitored into the late nebular phase . @xcite",
    "published optical photometry covering from 2002 june to december and spectroscopy continuing to 2003 february .",
    "the spectra show unusually strong and sharp - peaked [ ] and ] emission lines ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "late - time spectroscopy was also obtained by other observers ( y. qiu ; k. kawabata ; s. b. pandey ; private communications ) , and late - time photometry by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is also important to have intensive late - time nir observations of type ib / c sne .",
    "as demonstrated in the case of sn 1998bw @xcite , the nir contribution to the total flux is quite large , in particular at late times .",
    "late - time nir observations may also reveal molecule and dust formation , if any exists ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , few type ib / c sne have been observed at late phases in the nir . for sn 2002ap ,",
    "the only late - time nir observation published so far is a spectrum taken in 2002 august @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report on @xmath0 imaging photometry obtained for sn 2002ap between 2002 june 12 and 2003 august 29 , completing the 1.5 years follow - up project with the magnum telescope ( see also paper i ) . we describe the observations and data reduction and",
    "present our multicolor lcs in  2 .",
    "an @xmath1 bolometric lc is then constructed using the photometry . in  3 , we discuss the bolometric lc , analyze the evolution of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , compare the late - time nir lcs with those of other type ib / c sne , and present 1-d models for the bolometric lc .",
    "optical ( johnson - cousins @xmath20 ) and nir ( @xmath21 ) imaging photometry of sn 2002ap ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) was carried out using the magnum 2 m telescope at the summit of haleakala on the island of maui , hawaii @xcite .",
    "the multicolor imaging photometer mounted at the bent - cassegrain focus has an site @xmath24 pixel ccd with a scale of @xmath25pixel@xmath18 , for which the light is effectively received in a field of view of @xmath26 pixel ccd or @xmath27 , and also has an sbrc @xmath28 pixel insb with a scale of @xmath29pixel@xmath18 yielding a field of view of @xmath30 .",
    "a dichroic beam splitter enables simultaneous imaging through optical ( @xmath31 ) and nir ( @xmath32 ) filters @xcite .",
    "the observations were scheduled by the magnum scheduler @xcite , except for the solar conjunction from march to june in 2003 .",
    "telescope dithering was performed with 6 or 10-arcsec steps primary for @xmath21 .",
    "the typical exposure time for one step was 190 sec for @xmath33 , 95 sec for @xmath34 , 65 sec for each of @xmath35 , 60 sec for @xmath36 and 30 sec for each of @xmath37 .",
    "as sn 2002ap faded , the number of dithering steps was increased from 6 to 12 .",
    "the typical seeing size of the stellar image was 1.0 - 1.6 arcsec in @xmath34 and 0.85 - 1.4 arcsec in @xmath38 .",
    "dome - flat images for @xmath0 and nir dark images were obtained at the end of each night .",
    "image reduction was performed using our package of iraf - based automated reduction software ( magred ) , which includes the standard corrections for bias and flat field frames . for more details",
    "see paper i.    two reference stars , a and b , were observed in the same frame of sn 2002ap for differential photometry .",
    "one reference star ( a , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) was used for @xmath20 as in paper i. the other reference star ( b , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) was used for @xmath21 . in order to calibrate the magnitude of star b , nir standard stars @xcite were also observed , whenever possible , either before or after the observation of sn 2002ap .",
    "the median magnitudes and the number of calibrations for star b in the insb frame are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "a variability check was made for stars a and b by increasing the total exposure time in proportion as sn 2002ap faded .",
    "figure 1 shows the difference between their @xmath20 magnitudes after 2003 july , when the optical flux of star b became detectable .",
    "( it was not possible to make the same plot in the nir because star a was usually outside or on the edge of the insb detector . )",
    "the error bars estimated from photon statistics are in good agreement with the dispersion of the data points , so that it is not necessary to regard stars a and b as variable .",
    "simple aperture photometry was used throughout , and the aperture magnitude of sn 2002ap was obtained as the magnitude difference between sn 2002ap and star a or b. an aperture size of 6.9 arcsec was adopted for all images , which minimizes the dispersion of the differential photometry .",
    "however , special care was taken for reliable magnitude determination of sn 2002ap , given the presence of a faint background object within a distance of about 1 arcsec .",
    "this object became distinguishable from sn 2002ap , when sn 2002ap became sufficiently faint after solar conjunction in 2003 . in 2003",
    "december , sn 2002ap faded compared to the background object , and it was easy to resolve sn  2002ap and the object separately .",
    "then , using the iraf daophot package , the psf magnitude of the object was measured several times when the seeing was relatively good .",
    "this way , the psf magnitude of the object was determined as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "these fluxes were subtracted from each aperture photometry of sn 2002ap .",
    "moreover , reference star b in nir photometry has a faint nearby star which is about 4 mag fainter .",
    "photometry was performed on the images where this faint nearby star was subtracted using iraf daophot package .",
    "the @xmath0 data taken over 42 nights from june 12 , 2002 to aug 29 , 2003 are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "the uncertainty in each magnitude was derived combining in quadrature the magnitude dispersion from the frames obtained during the same night and the magnitude error of reference star a for @xmath20 , or b for @xmath21 .",
    "a small error of 0.01 mag was added in quadrature for the @xmath20 magnitudes , taking into account the non - linearity correction error between sn 2002ap and reference star a. another 0.01mag error caused by the seeing effect , arising from the profile difference between sn 2002ap and the reference star a , was also added .",
    "the absolute calibration error and the subtracted flux uncertainty of the background object were taken into account when evaluating the total photometry error .",
    "no color - term correction was applied to the magnitudes of sn 2002ap in the nebular phase , because strong line emissions and large color difference with respect to the main sequence star make this correction particularly difficult , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "we show the magnum @xmath12 lcs in figure 2 ( _ filled circles _ ) , combining the late - time data in table 1 and the early - time data of paper i. for comparison , we also show the @xmath31 photometry of @xcite ( @xmath53 days ; _ crosses _ ) , that of @xcite ( @xmath54 days ; _ open circles _ ) , and the early - time @xmath21 photometry of @xcite ( @xmath55 days ; _ open circles _ ) .",
    "obviously , our lcs have the largest time span .",
    "they are unique also in that both the early and late phase were well covered in nir , the first time for any sn ib / c .",
    "to guide the eye , we made b - spline fits ( _ solid lines _ ) to the data , excluding the pandey and foley late - time ones .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the decline of the late - time lc slowed down after september 2002 in several bands .",
    "we derived the decline rates and the date when the decline rate changed in each band by @xmath56-fitting the late - time magnum data using a broken line ( see table 2 ) . before the change , which took place between about day 210 and 250 , the decline rate was similar in all bands , i.e. , about @xmath57 mag / day .",
    "the change is most profound in the nir , as the @xmath36 and @xmath4 lcs flattened from 0.018 mag / day to 0.012 and 0.008 mag / day , respectively .",
    "it is small for most optical bands , although the @xmath34 lc did flatten from 0.021 to 0.014 mag / day . as a result ,",
    "the nir contribution to the total flux increased significantly going to very late times .",
    "this will be discussed further in the next section .",
    "most of our late - time data agree well with the @xcite ones , although their @xmath33 magnitudes are 0.1 - 0.2 mag brighter than ours after day 280 and their @xmath58 magnitudes 0.1 - 0.25 mag brighter after day 160 .",
    "the @xcite late - time data are 0.1 - 0.15 mag brighter than ours in the @xmath33 band , 0.2 - 0.4 mag brighter in the @xmath34 band , and 0.1 - 0.2 mag fainter in the @xmath58 band .",
    "those differences can be partly explained by measurement uncertainties inherent to practical broadband photometry of sne ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , since these objects have time - evolving and line - dominated spectra of non - stellar nature .",
    "our late - time @xmath20 lcs can differ from the those of @xcite and @xcite by as much as 0.3 mag . however , their data were less well sampled than ours .",
    "the late - time evolution of the optical colors , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , is very different between sn 2002ap and sn 1998bw , as shown in figure 3 . in particular ,",
    "@xmath60 of sn 2002ap between day 140 and 330 is about 0.3 - 0.6 mag larger and @xmath59 between day 200 and 340 about 0.3 mag smaller than in sn 1998bw .",
    "this can be easily understood within the context of spectroscopy . in the nebular phase ,",
    "the spectra of both sne were dominated by [ ] @xmath626300,6364 in the @xmath63 band , [ ] multiplets in the @xmath34 and @xmath33 bands , and ] @xmath644571 in the @xmath33 band , while ] @xmath627291,7324 may also contribute to the @xmath63 and @xmath58 photometry and the nir triplet to the @xmath58 photometry depending on the actual filter cut - off . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "sn 2002ap has the strongest [ ] @xmath626300,6364 and ] @xmath644571 nebular emissions of any sn published .",
    "however , its [ ] multiplets are much weaker than in sn 1998bw , a consequence of much less @xmath14ni ejected by sn 2002ap . between day 390 and 520 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 dropped and @xmath59 rose rapidly .",
    "this may indicate a flux shift from emissions of intermediate - mass elements to [ ] multiplets .",
    "unfortunately , no observed spectra have so far been obtained for type ib / c sne at such late times .",
    "we built the @xmath1 bolometric lc integrating the @xmath0 broadband flux ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "a reddening of @xmath65 was corrected for @xcite , and a distance modulus of 29.5 was adopted ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "the lc is shown in figure 4 , extending that in paper i to @xmath66 days since explosion .",
    "it consists of three independent data sets , which agree with one another .",
    "most of the data ( _ filled circles _ ) , tabulated in table 3 ( _ late time _ ) and paper i ( _ early time _ ) , were made from the magnum photometry .",
    "we interpolated and extrapolated the observations to estimate the the @xmath38 magnitudes between day 280 and 340 and the @xmath36 and @xmath58 magnitudes at day 520 . for epochs",
    "@xmath67 days , the observations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite were used for interpolation .",
    "bolometric magnitudes at day 407 and 578 ( _ triangles _ ) were converted from @xmath4 magnitudes using approximate bolometric corrections .",
    "the other two data sets were based on the @xcite ( _ open circles _ ) and @xcite ( _ crosses _ ) optical photometry , respectively , which was combined with the @xcite and our @xmath21 photometry .",
    "the bolometric lc at late time has a shape similar to that of sn 1998bw ( figure 4 ; _ squares _ ) , another hypernova , although the latter was much brighter .",
    "the sn 1998bw lc in figure 4 is shifted down by 1.75 mag to match the peak magnitude of sn 2002ap .",
    "both lcs show a similar late - time slowing - down . for sn 2002ap ,",
    "the decline rate changed from @xmath68 mag / day between day 130 and 230 to @xmath69 mag / day between day 270 and 580 .",
    "for sn 1998bw , the decline rate was @xmath70 mag / day between day 70 and 220 and @xmath69 mag / day between day 320 and 540 .",
    "for comparison , the late - time bolometric lc of another hypernova , sn 1997ef , followed the decay rate of @xmath14co , i.e. , @xmath71 mag / day @xcite . on the other hand , sn 2002ap reached its light maximum @xmath72 days earlier than sn 1998bw did , although their peak widths are actually comparable ( figure 4 ; _ inset _ ) .",
    "we show the sed of sn 2002ap at 5 typical late epochs in figure 5 , where the monochromatic fluxes converted from the magnum @xmath0 photometry are connected using spline - fitting curves .",
    "the observed upper limits of the @xmath38-band flux at day 393 and 520 are marked by _",
    "arrows_. zero flux was assumed at both the the blue edge of the @xmath33 band and the red edge of the @xmath38 band .",
    "we used such seds to obtain the @xmath1 bolometric magnitudes .",
    "the seds are dominated by the flux in the @xmath63 and @xmath58 bands before about day 340 - 390 , which was mainly due to strong [ ] , ] , and emissions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath33 bump at the three intermediate epochs reflects the contribution of ] @xmath644571 .",
    "after about day 340 - 390 , the @xmath34 flux , attributed to [ ] multiplets , increased relative to that in other optical bands , while the @xmath58-band - dominated emissions died away .",
    "the nir flux contribution rose rapidly after @xmath5 day 300 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "this can been seen in figure 5 as a big @xmath4 bump in the sed and also in figure 2 as a significant flattening of the @xmath4 and @xmath36 lcs .",
    "to explain this , we examined the synthesized nir spectra of the models that reproduce the late - time optical spectra of sn 2002ap ( p. a. mazzali et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "the most likely candidates are the strong [ ] 1.646 @xmath6 m and 1.608 @xmath6 m lines , while the 1.099 @xmath6 m line may account for the concurrent @xmath36-band flux increase .",
    "the lines were already developed in the day @xmath5 200 nir spectrum of @xcite , although they were still not as strong as a 1.5 @xmath6 m feature , possibly emission .",
    "we note in passing that the appearance of the co first - overtone band in that spectrum suggested by those authors seems to coincide with the @xmath38-band lc steepening seen in figure 2 .",
    "the late - time @xmath4-band spectra of sn 1983n , taken by @xcite and of very low resolution , showed a strong 1.65 @xmath6 m feature , which was explained by those authors as [ ] lines but was soon , together with an adjacent feature , re - identified as [ ] lines by @xcite .",
    "these [ ] nir features can also be found in the synthetic late - time spectra of type ib sne computed by @xcite .      in figure 7",
    "we compare the late - time @xmath21 lcs of sn 2002ap with those of other type ib / c sne ( see table 4 ) .",
    "sn 1998bw and sn 1984l were 1.52.5 mag brighter than all other sne , indicating a large mass of @xmath14ni ejected .",
    "the nir lcs of sn 1984l were relatively slow , as was its late - time optical lc which was modelled using very massive ejecta but with normal kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "the few points of sn 1998bw , when shifted down by 1.8 mag ( @xmath36 ) , 1.5 mag ( @xmath4 ) , and 1.7 mag ( @xmath38 ) , respectively , fall on the lcs of sn 2002ap .",
    "the lcs of sn 1983n have later and broader peaks than those of sn 2002ap , but they become similar between in the @xmath36-band and @xmath4-band day @xmath5 200 and 350 . on the other hand , the @xmath21 data of sn 1983i and 1982r seem to bridge the lc gap in sn 2002ap data between day 50 and day 140 ( solar conjunction ) .",
    "figure 7 contradicts the picture that sne 1983i , 1983n , and 1984l have similar @xmath21 lcs @xcite .",
    "type ib / c sne were first established as a new class by those authors , who showed that these sne have similar @xmath21 lcs which are different from those of type ia sne [ and also by @xcite through an analysis of the optical spectra ] .",
    "they artificially shifted the data of sn 1983i and sn 1984l in both phase and brightness in order to match the nir lcs of sn 1983n .",
    "their sn 1983i data were assigned epochs 20 days later than ours , and sn 1984l 14 days earlier .",
    "our epoch estimates are more reasonable because we based them on optical lcs and spectra which are better observed and understood than the nir data .",
    "inspecting by eye the only published spectrum of sn 1983i @xcite , we noticed that it resembles those of sn 2002ap between 2002 february 16 and 22 @xcite .",
    "the similarity can be seen not only in the overall shape and strongest line features , but also in relatively weak ones , like those near @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "the spectrum was taken on 1983 may 17 , 5 days after discovery .",
    "we estimate the epoch of that spectrum as @xmath76 days since explosion , through this comparison , and hence derive an explosion date of 1983 april 25 .",
    "the lcs of sn 1983i seem to match those of sn 2002ap not only in the nir ( figure 7 ) but also in the optical ( figure 8) , if our estimates of the explosion date and the distance modulus are correct .",
    "we adopt 31.0 as the distance modulus to the host galaxy of sn 1983i , ngc 4051 in the ursa major cluster @xcite .",
    "this value is also close to the average of the distance modulus of the ursa major cluster ( 31.4 , @xcite ) , and that corresponding to its radial velocity corrected for the local group infall onto virgo ( 30.5 , leda ; @xcite )        the late - time bolometric lc of sn 2002ap declines more slowly than that of the 1-dimensional ( 1-d ) model of @xcite that best reproduced the early - time spectra and lc ( see figure 9 ; _ dotted line _ ) .",
    "this is expected , since the lc follows that of sn 1998bw closely in terms of the decline rate , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the best - fitting 1-d model for the early - time spectra and lc of sn 1998bw also fails to explain its late - time spectrum and lc @xcite . to mimic the outcome of 2-dimensional jet - induced explosion calculations @xcite , which applies to sn 1998bw and",
    "may also apply to sn 2002ap , @xcite introduced a dense core . that core absorbs @xmath77-rays efficiently at late time . using this structure ,",
    "the slow lc decline of hypernovae was reproduced by those authors using a monte - carlo radiative transfer code but with simplified physics .",
    "we tested the dense - core scenario on sn 2002ap using our sophisticated 1-d sn radiation hydrodynamical and @xmath77-ray transfer code @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting model ( _ solid line _ ) has @xmath78 ejecta below 3,000 km  s@xmath18 , compared with 0.1 @xmath2 in the model without a dense core , and @xmath79 low - velocity @xmath14ni . compared with @xcite , who modelled only the early - time observations , the total ejecta mass has increased from 2.5 @xmath2 to 3 @xmath2 , but with little change in the total @xmath14ni mass ( 0.08 @xmath2 ) and the kinetic energy ( @xmath80 ergs ) .",
    "a dense ejecta core is also required in 1-d late - time spectrum models ( p. a. mazzali et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) in order to explain the observed sharp line cores of [ ] and ] @xcite .",
    "a dense core can not be formed in 1-d explosion simulations for hypernovae @xcite , but it is a natural product of 2-d jet - induced explosions @xcite .",
    "this strongly indicates asymmetry in the sn 2002ap explosion , an intrinsic feature also shared by other hypernovae .",
    "evidence of asymmetry in sn 2002ap can also be found in spectropolarimetry @xcite , which shows an intrinsic continuum polarization varying around 0.5% , corresponding to an asphericity of @xmath5 10% for the bulk of the ejecta .",
