    "it has been speculated for some time that inspiraling neutron stars could provide a power source for cosmological gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "however , previous newtonian and post - newtonian studies @xcite of the final merger of two neutron stars have found that the neutrino emission time scales are so short that it would be difficult to drive a gamma - ray burst from this source .",
    "it is clear that a mechanism is required for extending the duration of energetic neutrino emission .",
    "a number of possibilities could be envisioned , for example , neutrino emission powered by accretion shocks , mhd or tidal interactions between the neutron stars , etc .",
    "the present study , however , has been primarily motivated by numerical studies of the strong field relativistic hydrodynamics of close neutron star binaries ( nsbs ) in three spatial dimensions .",
    "these studies @xcite suggest that neutron stars in a close binary can experience relativistic compression and heating over a period of seconds . during the compression phase",
    "released gravitational binding energy can be converted into internal energy .",
    "subsequently , up to @xmath3 ergs in thermally produced neutrinos can be emitted before the stars collapse @xcite .",
    "here we briefly summarize the physical basis of this model and numerically explore its consequences for the development of an @xmath0 plasma and associated grb .    in @xcite properties of equal - mass neutron - star binaries",
    "were computed as a function of mass and eos ( equation of state ) . from these studies",
    "it was deduced that compression , heating and collapse could occur a few seconds before binary merger .",
    "our calculation of the rates of released binding energy and neutron star cooling suggests that interior temperatures as hot as 70 mev are achieved .",
    "this leads to a high neutrino luminosity which peaks at @xmath4 ergs sec@xmath5 .",
    "this much neutrino luminosity would partially convert to an @xmath0 pair plasma above the stars as is also observed above the nascent neutron star in supernova simulations @xcite .",
    "having outlined a mechanism by which neutrino luminosities of 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7 ergs / sec may arise from binary neutron stars approaching their final orbits , we must calculate the efficiency of conversion of neutrino pairs into an electron pair plasma via @xmath8 . here",
    "we argue that the efficiency for converting these neutrinos into pair plasma is probably quite high .",
    "neutrinos emerging from the stars will deposit energy outside the stars predominantly by @xmath9 annihilation to form electron pairs . a secondary mechanism for energy deposition",
    "is the scattering of neutrinos from the @xmath0 pairs .",
    "strong gravitational fields near the stars will bend the neutrino trajectories .",
    "this greatly enhances the annihilation and scattering rates @xcite . for our employed neutron - star equations of state",
    "the radius to mass ratio is typically between @xmath10 and 4 just before stellar collapse ( in units @xmath11 ) . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that @xmath9 annihilation rates will be enhanced by a factor @xmath12 to @xmath13 due to relativistic effects . from eq .",
    "24 of @xcite we obtain , @xmath14 thus , the efficiency of annihilation ranges from @xmath150.1 to @xmath16 . for the upper range of luminosity",
    "the efficiency is quite large .",
    "also , using the supernova code of wilson and mayle @xcite we calculate the entropy per baryon of the plasma to be as high as @xmath17 , thus the resulting pair plasma will have low baryon loading .",
    "having determined the initial conditions of the hot @xmath0 pair plasma near the surface of a neutron star , we wish to follow its evolution and characterize the observable gamma - ray emission . to study this",
    "we have developed a spherically symmetric , general relativistic hydrodynamic computer code to track the flow of baryons , @xmath0 pairs , and photons .",
    "for the present discussion we consider the plasma deposited at the surface of a @xmath18 neutron star with a radius of 10 km .",
    "discussion of this code can be found in @xcite . in those papers the emission from an expanding fireball was studied . in figure",
    "[ jwg : date52 ] it is shown that the resulting emission spectrum and @xmath2-ray emission efficiency @xmath19 strongly depends upon the entropy per baryon of the plasma deposited near the surface of the neutron stars ; entropies of @xmath20 resulted in weak emission with most of the original energy manifesting itself as kinetic energy of the baryons .",
    "thus , for the low entropy per baryon fireballs ( @xmath21 ) produced by nsbs it is necessary to examine the emission due to the interaction of the relativistically expanding baryon wind with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "we find that these baryon winds typically have a lorentz factor @xmath22 and have a total energy @xmath23 ergs .    after becoming optically thin and decoupling with the photons , the matter component of",
    "the fireball continues to expand and interact with the ism via collisionless shocks .",
    "as the ism is swept up , the matter decelerates .",
    "we model this process as an inelastic collision between the expanding fireball and the ism as in , for example , @xcite .",
    "we assume that the absorbed internal energy is immediately radiated away . from this",
    "we construct a simple picture of the emission due to the matter component of the fireball `` snowplowing '' into the ism of baryon number density @xmath24 .",
    "we have constructed an analytic formula for the luminosity in time @xcite of the fireball plowing into the ism .",
    "we show a plot of this function in figure [ jwg : ltcurve ] for a range of ism densities . defining @xmath25 as the time of maximum luminosity @xmath26 this luminosity curve has the",
    "so called `` fred '' ( fast rise , exponential decay ) profile which is characteristic of real bursts .",
    "using the theory of synchrotron shocks ( e.g. @xcite ) we can construct a spectrum as shown in figure [ jwg : spec ] . to model the synchrotron spectrum",
    "there are three free parameters : @xmath27 are the fractions of baryonic kinetic energy that is deposited into the magnetic field and the electrons respectively , and @xmath24 , the number density of baryons in the ism . in these calculations",
    "we assume @xmath28 .",
    "as shown in figure [ jwg : spec ] , a reasonable ism density of 1 baryon/@xmath29 gives a peak in the @xmath30 spectrum at @xmath31 kev in agreement with observations .",
    "calculations of the efficiency show that 75 % of the energy is emitted at photon energies of 10 kev and above @xcite .",
    "in this proceedings we have argued that heated neutron stars ( perhaps by stellar compression of close neutron - star binaries ) are viable candidates for the production of large , high entropy per baryon , @xmath0 pair plasma fireballs , and thus , for the creation of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "we find that fireballs of total energies @xmath32 to @xmath33 ergs and entropies per baryon @xmath34 are possible . also , this model gives a power - law spectrum that peaks at hundreds of kev and has an overall efficiency of 10 - 20 % .",
