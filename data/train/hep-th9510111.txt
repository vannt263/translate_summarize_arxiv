    "the quantization of non - abelian gauge theory is complicated by the presence of the so - called gribov problem@xcite@xcite@xcite[4 ] .",
    "the gribov problem in general suggests that the coulomb gauge can not completely fix the gauge due to the presence of more than one gauge configurations which satisfy the coulomb gauge condition or , in certain circumstances in compactified space - time , it even suggests the absence of the gauge configuration which satisfies the coulomb gauge condition [ 2 ] . in euclidean formulation of gauge theory ,",
    "the landau gauge also suffers from the same complications .",
    "although the full details of the gribov problem are not understood yet , a working prescription is figured out if one regards the gribov problem as the appearance of several gauge copies ( i.e. , if one assumes that one can always find at least one gauge configuration which satisfies the coulomb gauge condition ) .",
    "in fact , it was noted some time ago@xcite that if the functional correspondence between @xmath0 and the gauge parameter @xmath1 defined by @xmath7 is `` globally single valued '' , the path integral with brst symmetry@xcite is defined by summing over gribov copies in a very specific way . for a more general gauge fixing , ( 1.1 ) may be replaced by @xmath8 where @xmath9 specifies the gauge condition . in ( 1.1 ) or (",

    "the globally single valued correspondence between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which is explained in more detail in section 2 , is required for any value of @xmath14 to write a simple path integral formula . [",
    "if one restricts oneself to only one of the gribov copies by some means@xcite , one can also incorporate the idea of brst symmetry .",
    "but a simple prescription which selectively picks up only one copy appears to be misssing at this moment . ]",
    "recently a very detailed analysis of the gribov problem was performed by friedberg , lee , pang and ren@xcite on the basis of a soluble gauge model which exhibits gribov - type copies .",
    "one of the main conclusions in @xcite is that the singularity associated with the so - called gribov horizon is immaterial at least in their soluble model and one may incorporate all the gribov copies in a very specific way .",
    "they showed how this prescription works in the soluble model proposed by them .",
    "the present work is motivated by the fact that the model and the gauge choice in ref.@xcite satisfy our criterion in ( 1.1 ) or ( 1.2 ) .",
    "one can thus formulate a brst invariant path integral for the model proposed in [ 8 ] by summing over gribov - type copies ;  the physical quantities thus calculated agree with those in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that the brst symmetry deals with an extended hilbert space which contains indefinite metric in general , although the physical sector specified by brst cohomology contains only positive metric .",
    "since the brst symmetry plays a fundamental role in modern gauge theory , we here present a detailed brst analysis of the soluble model proposed in @xcite .",
    "in this section we recapitulate the essence of the argument presented in @xcite . we start with the faddeev - popov formulation of the feynman - type gauge condition @xcite@xcite .",
    "the vacuum - to - vacuum transition amplitude is defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the action invariant under the yang - mills local gauge transformation .",

    "[ the equations in this section are written in the minkowski metric , but they should really be interpreted in the euclidean metric to render the functional integral and the gribov problem well - defined . ] in the following we often suppress the internal symmetry indices , and instead we write the gauge parameter explicitly : @xmath18 indicates the gauge field which is obtained from @xmath14 by a gauge transformation specified by @xmath19 .",

    "equation(2.2 ) is valid only for sufficiently small @xmath17 , since the parameter @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 has a complicated branch structure for large @xmath25 in the presence of gribov ambiguities .",
    "obviously the feynman - type gauge formulation becomes even more involved than the landau - type gauge condition .",

    "is in general no more degenerate with respect to gauge equivalent configurations even if the gauge fixing term itself may be degenerate for certain configurations .",
    "another important point is that one takes the absolute values of determinant factors in ( 2.2 ) thanks to the definition of the @xmath27-function , whereas just the determinant which can be negative as well as positive appears in ( 2.4 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that ( 2.4 ) can be rewritten as @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 the lagrangian multiplier field , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 the ( hermitian ) faddeev - popov ghost fields ; @xmath33 is the structure constant of the gauge group and @xmath34 is the gauge coupling constant .",
    "if one imposes the hermiticity of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the phase factor of the determinant in ( 2.4 ) can not be removed .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath35 in ( 2.5 ) includes the effect of gaussian integral over @xmath36 in addition to @xmath37 in ( 2.4 ) , and in fact @xmath35 is independent of @xmath17 . see eq .",

    "note that the transformation ( 2.7 ) is `` local '' in the @xmath1 parameter;precisely for this property , the prescription in ( 2.4 ) was chosen .",
    "to interprete the path integral measure in ( 2.4 ) as the path integral over all the gauge field configurations divided by the gauge volume , namely @xmath46 one needs to define the normalization factor in ( 2.4 ) by @xmath47 exp\\{- \\frac{i}{2\\alpha}{\\int}c(x)^{2}dx\\}\\nonumber\\\\    & = & { \\int}{\\cal d}\\omega det[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\omega}\\partial^{\\mu}a_{\\mu}^{\\omega } ] exp\\{- \\frac{i}{2\\alpha}{\\int}(\\partial^{\\mu}a_{\\mu}^{\\omega})^{2}dx\\}\\nonumber\\\\    & = & { \\int}{\\cal d}\\tau\\ exp\\{- \\frac{i}{2\\alpha}{\\int}\\tau ( x)^{2}dx\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath0 is defined by @xmath48 and the determinant factor is regarded as a jacobian for the change of variables from @xmath12 to @xmath49 .",
    "although we use the feynman - type gauge fixing ( 2.11 ) as a typical example in this section , one may replace ( 2.11 ) by @xmath50 to deal with a more general gauge condition @xmath51 it is crucial to establish that the normalization factor in ( 2.10 ) is independent of @xmath14 .",
    "only in this case , ( 2.4 ) defines an acceptable vacuum transition amplitude .",

    "[ if the normalization factor @xmath37 should depend on gauge field @xmath14 , the factor @xmath37 , which is gauge independent in the sense that we integrated over entire gauge orbit , needs to be taken inside the path integral in ( 2.4 ) . in this case one",
    "looses the simplicity of the formula ( 2.4 ) . ]",
    "the basic assumption we have to make is therefore that ( 2.11 ) in the context of the path integral ( 2.10 ) is `` globally single - valued '' , in the sense that the asymptotic functional correspondence between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is little affected by a fixed @xmath14 with @xmath53@xcite ;  fig.1 satisfies this requirement .",
    "this assumption appears to be physically reasonable if the second derivative term of the gauge orbit parameter dominates the functional correspondence in ( 2.11 ) , though it has not been established mathematically . to define the functional correspondence between @xmath1 and @xmath0 in ( 2.11 ) , one needs in general some notion of norm such as @xmath54-norm for which the coulomb gauge vacuum is unique [ 3][4 ] .",
    "the functional configurations which are square integrable however have zero measure in the path integral[11 ] , and this makes the precise analysis of ( 2.11 ) very complicated :   at least what we need to do is to start with an expansion of a generic field variable in terms of some complete orthonormal basis set ( which means that the field is inside the @xmath54-space ) and then let each expansion coefficient vary from @xmath55 to @xmath56(which means that the field is outside the @xmath54-space ) .",
    "if the gribov problem simply means the situation as is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 , the prescription in ( 2.4 ) may be justified .",
    "the indefinite signature of the determinant factor in ( 2.4 ) is not a difficulty in the framework of indefinite metric field theory@xcite@xcite",
    "since the determinant factor is associated with the faddeev - popov ghost fields and the brst cohomology selects the positive definite physical space . on the other hand , the gribov problem may aslo suggest that one can not bring the relation(2.11 ) with fixed @xmath14 to @xmath57 by any gauge transformation@xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the asymptotic behavior of the mapping ( 2.11 ) is in general modified by @xmath14 and our prescription can not be justified . consequently , the prescription ( 2.4 ) may be valid to the extent that one can always achieve the condition @xmath53 by means of suitable ( but not necessarily unique ) gauge transformations .",

    "this correspondence between @xmath64 and @xmath83 thus satisfies our criterion discussed in connection with ( 2.11 ) .",
    "the absence of terms which contain the derivatives of @xmath64 in ( 3.9 ) makes the functional correspondence in ( 3.9 ) well - defined and transparent .    from a view point of gauge fixing in ( 3.6 ) , this `` globally single - valued '' correspondence between @xmath1 and @xmath0 means that one always obtains an _ odd _ number of solutions for ( 3.6 ) .",

    "this criterion is satisfied by the soluble gauge model proposed in ref.[8 ] , and it is encouraging that the brst invariant prescription is in accord with the canonical analysis of the soluble gauge model in ref.@xcite .",

    "this gauge condition with @xmath117 renders the canonical structure better - defined , and it allows simpler perturbative treatments of the problems such as the corrections to the ground state energy .",
    "our calculation vis - a - vis the explicit canonical analysis in ref.@xcite may provide a ( partial ) justification of conventional covariant perturbation theory in gauge theory , which is based on lorentz invariance ( or @xmath232-product ) and brst invariance without the operator ordering terms .",
    "motivated by the observation in ref.[8 ] to the effect that the gribov horizons are not really singular in quantum mechanical sense , which is in accord with our path integral in ( 3.21 ) , we would like to make a speculative comment on the role of gribov copies in qcd .",
    "first of all , the topological phenomena related to instantons for which the coulomb gauge is generally singular may be analyzed in the temporal gauge @xmath66 ;  this gauge is relatively free from the gribov complications[3 ] .",
    "a semi - classical treatment of instantons with small quantum fluctuations around them will presumably give qualitatively reliable estimates of topological effects .",
    "as for other non - perturbative effects such as quark confinement and hadronic spectrum , one may follow the argument of witten [ 22 ] on the basis of @xmath5 expansion in qcd[23 ] ;  he argues that the @xmath5 expansion scheme comes closer to the real qcd than the instanton analysis in the study of hadron spectrum .",
    "if this is the case , one can analyze the qualitative aspects of hadron spectrum on the basis of a sum of ( an infinite number of ) feynman diagrams .",
    "this diagramatic approach or an analytical treatment equivalent to it in the feynman - type gauge deals with topologically trivial gauge fields but may still suffer from the gribov copies , as is suggested by the analysis in ref.[4 ] : if one assumes that the vacuum is unique in this case as is the case in @xmath54-space , the global single - valuedness in ( 2.11 ) in the context of path integral ( 2.10 ) will be preserved for infinitesimally small fields @xmath14 . by a continuity argument , a smooth deformation of @xmath14 in @xmath54-space ( or its extension as explained in section 2 ) will presumably keep the integral ( 2.10 ) unchanged .",
    "if this argument should be valid , our path integral formula in ( 2.4 ) would be justified .",
    "if our speculation is correct , the formal path integral formula ( 2.5 ) will provide a basis for the analysis of some non - perturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "on the other hand , the gribov problem may also suggest the presence of some field configurations which do not satisfy any given gauge condition in four dimensional non - abelian gauge theory [ 2 ] .",
    "for example , one may not be able to find any gauge parameter @xmath12 which satisfies @xmath263 for some fields @xmath14 .",
    "although the measure of such field configurations in path integral is not known , the presence of such filed configurations would certainly modify the asymptotic correspondence in ( 2.11 ) . in the context of brst symmetry",
    ", the gribov problem may then induce complicated phenomena such as the dynamical instability of brst symmetry[24 ] .",
    "if the dynamical instability of brst symmetry should take place , the relation corresponding to ( 3.27 ) , which is a result of the brst invariance of the vacuum , would no longer be derived . in the framework of path integral , this failure of ( 3.27 ) would be recognized as the failure of the expansion ( 3.19 ) since the normalization factor @xmath37 in ( 3.21 ) would generally depend on not only field variables but also @xmath71 if the global single - valuedness in ( 3.17 ) should be violated .",
    "finally , we note that the lattice gauge theory [ 25 ] , which is based on compactified field variables , is expected to change the scope and character of the gribov problem completely .",
    "the gribov problem is intricately related to the difficult issue of the non - perturbative continuum limit of lattice gauge theory . [",
    "note that the perturbative continuum limit is not quite relevant in the present context , since we do not worry about the gribov problem much in weak field perturbation theory ] .",
