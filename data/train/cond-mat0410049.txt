    "the effective field theory ( eft ) approach provides a powerful framework that exploits the separation of scales in physical systems @xcite .",
    "only low - energy ( or long - range ) degrees of freedom are included explicitly , with the rest parametrized in terms of the most general local contact interactions .",
    "this procedure exploits the fact that a low - energy probe of momentum @xmath1 can not resolve structures on scales smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "( note that @xmath3 in this talk . ) using renormalization , the influence of short - distance physics on low - energy observables is captured in a few low - energy constants .",
    "thus , the eft describes universal low - energy physics independent of detailed assumptions about the short - distance dynamics .",
    "all physical observables can be described in a controlled expansion in powers of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the characteristic low - energy length scale of the system .",
    "the size of @xmath5 depends on the system under consideration : for a finite range potential , e.g. , it is given by the range of the potential .",
    "for the systems discussed here , @xmath5 is of the order of the effective range @xmath6 .",
    "we will focus on applications of eft to few - body systems with large s - wave scattering length @xmath7 . for a generic system ,",
    "the scattering length is of the same order of magnitude as the low - energy length scale @xmath5 .",
    "only a very specific choice of the parameters in the underlying theory ( a so - called _ fine tuning _ ) will generate a large scattering length @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , systems with large scattering length can be found in many areas of physics .",
    "the fine tuning can be accidental or it can be controlled by an external parameter .",
    "examples for an accidental fine tuning are the s - wave scattering of nucleons or of @xmath9he atoms . for alkali atoms close to a feshbach resonance",
    ", @xmath8 can be tuned experimentally by adjusting an external magnetic field . at very low energies these systems behave similarly and show universal properties associated with the large scattering length .",
    "we will start with a brief review of the eft for few - body systems with large @xmath8 and then discuss some of the universal properties predicted in three and two spatial dimensions .",
    "we consider three spatial dimensions first . for typical momenta @xmath10 ,",
    "the eft expansion is in powers of @xmath11 ; in leading order we can set @xmath12 .",
    "we start with a two - body system of nonrelativistic bosonic atoms with large s - wave scattering length @xmath8 and mass @xmath13 . at sufficiently low energies",
    ", the most general lagrangian may be written as : @xmath14 where the @xmath15 and @xmath16 are nonderivative two- and three - body interaction terms , respectively .",
    "the strength of the @xmath15 term is determined by the scattering length @xmath8 , while @xmath16 depends on a three - body parameter to be introduced below .",
    "the dots represent higher - order derivative terms which are suppressed at low - energies . for momenta @xmath1 of the order of the inverse scattering length @xmath17 , the problem is nonperturbative in @xmath18 .",
    "the exact two - body scattering amplitude can be obtained analytically by summing the so - called _ bubble diagrams _ with the @xmath15 interaction term .",
    "the @xmath16 term does not contribute to two - body observables .",
    "after renormalization , the resulting amplitude reproduces the leading order of the well - known effective range expansion for the atom - atom scattering amplitude :  @xmath19 where the total energy is @xmath20 . if @xmath21 , @xmath22 has a pole at @xmath23 corresponding to a shallow dimer with binding energy @xmath24 .",
    "higher - order derivative interactions are perturbative and give the momentum - dependent terms in the effective range expansion .",
    "we now turn to the three - body system . here , it is useful to introduce an auxiliary field for the two - atom state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . at leading order ,",
    "the atom - dimer scattering amplitude is given by the integral equation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ineq ] .",
    "a solid line indicates a single atom and a double line indicates an interacting two - atom state ( including rescattering corrections ) .",
    "the integral equation contains contributions from both the two - body and the three - body interaction terms .",
    "the inhomogeneous term is given by the first two diagrams on the right - hand side : the one - atom exchange diagram and the three - body interaction .",
    "the integral equation simply sums these diagrams to all orders . after projecting onto s - waves ,",
    "we obtain the equation @xmath25 for the off - shell atom - dimer scattering amplitude with the inhomogeneous term @xmath26 the logarithmic term is the s - wave projected one - atom exchange , while the term proportional to @xmath27 comes from the three - body force .",
    "the s - wave atom - dimer scattering amplitude @xmath28^{-1}$ ] is given by the solution @xmath29 evaluated at the on - shell point :  @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the three - body binding energies @xmath32 are given by those values of @xmath33 for which the homogeneous version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhvk ] ) has a nontrivial solution .",
    "note that an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath34 has been introduced in ( [ eq : bhvk ] ) .",
    "this cutoff is required to insure that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhvk ] ) has a unique solution .",
    "all physical observables , however , must be independent of @xmath34 , which determines the behavior of @xmath35 as a function of @xmath34 @xcite : @xmath36 \\over \\cos [ s_0 \\ln ( \\lambda/ \\lambda _ * ) - \\arctan s_0]}\\ , , \\label{h - lambda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a transcendental number and @xmath38 is a three - body parameter introduced by dimensional transmutation .",
    "this parameter can not be predicted by the eft and must be determined from a three - body observable . note also that @xmath39 is periodic and runs on a limit cycle .",
    "when @xmath34 is increased by a factor of @xmath40 , @xmath39 returns to its original value .    in summary ,",
    "two parameters are required to specify a three - body system at leading order in @xmath11 : they may be chosen as the scattering length @xmath8 ( or equivalently @xmath41 if @xmath21 ) and the three - body parameter @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this eft confirms and extends the universal predictions for the three - body system first derived by efimov @xcite .",
    "the best known example is the _ efimov effect _ , the accumulation of infinitely many three - body bound states at threshold as @xmath42 .",
    "universality also constrains three - body scattering observables .",
    "the atom - dimer scattering length , e.g. , can be expressed in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath38 as @xcite @xmath43)\\ , ( 1\\,+\\,{\\cal o}(l / a))\\,,\\qquad\\qquad a>0\\,.\\ ] ] note that the log - periodic dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath38 is not an artefact of the renormalization and also shows up in observables like @xmath44 .",
    "this dependence could , e.g. , be tested experimentally with atoms close to a feshbach resonance by varying @xmath8 .",
    "similar expressions can be obtained for other three - body observables such as scattering phase shifts as well as three - body recombination and dimer relaxation rates @xcite .    since up to corrections of order @xmath11 , low - energy three - body observables depend on @xmath8 and @xmath38 only , they obey non - trivial scaling relations . if dimensionless combinations of such observables are plotted against each other , the must fall close to a line parametrized by @xmath38 @xcite .",

    "the data points show calculations using various approaches and @xmath9he potentials . since different potentials have approximately the same scattering length but include different short - distance physics , different points on this line correspond to different values of @xmath38 .",
    "the small deviations of the potential model calculations are mainly due to effective range effects .",
    "they are of the order @xmath47 and can be calculated at next - to - leading order in eft . the calculation corresponding to the data point far off the universal curve can easily be identified as problematic since the deviation from universality by far exceeds the expected 10% . the right panel shows the scaling function relating the @xmath9he trimer ground state energy @xmath45 and the atom - dimer scattering length @xmath44 .",
    "( note that @xmath48 . )",
    "a similar scaling relation is observed in nuclear physics between the spin - doublet neutron - deuteron scattering length and the triton binding energy and is known as the phillips line .",
    "recently , we have extended the effective theory for large scattering length to the four - body system @xcite .",
    "it is advantageous in this case to use an effective quantum mechanics framework , since one can directly start from the well - know yakubovsky equations .",
    "we have shown that no four - body parameter enters at leading order in @xmath11 .",
    "therefore renormalization of the three - body system automatically guarantees renormalization of the four - body system . as a consequence ,",

    "we conclude that universality is well satisfied in the three- and four - body systems of @xmath9he atoms .",
    "the existence of these scaling functions is a universal feature of systems with large scattering length and is independent of the details of the short - distance physics .",
    "similar correlations between few - body observables appear for example also in nuclear systems .",
    "the correlation between the triton and @xmath49 particle binding energies ( the tjon line ) can be explained using the same effective theory @xcite .",
    "in this section , we consider the universal properties of weakly interacting bosons with large scattering length ( or equivalently a shallow dimer state ) in two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) @xcite . in particular , we consider self - bound droplets of @xmath50 bosons interacting weakly via an _ attractive _ , short - ranged pair potential .",
    "our analysis relies strongly on the property of asymptotic freedom of 2d bosons with an attractive interaction .    in 2d",
    ", any attractive potential has at least one bound state .",
    "for the potential @xmath51 with small @xmath52 , there is exactly one bound state with an exponentially small binding energy , @xmath53 where @xmath34 is the ultraviolet momentum cutoff ( which is the inverse of the range of the potential ) .",
    "asymptotic freedom provides an elegant way to understand this result . in 2d nonrelativistic theory ,",
    "the four - boson interaction @xmath54 is marginal .",
    "the coupling runs logarithmically with the length scale @xmath55 , and the running can be found by performing the standard renormalization group ( rg ) procedure . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the coupling grows in the infrared , in a manner similar to the qcd coupling .",
    "the dependence of the coupling on the length scale @xmath55 is given by @xmath57^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] so the coupling becomes large when @xmath55 is comparable to the size of the two body bound state @xmath58 .",
    "this is in essence the phenomenon of dimensional transmutation : a dynamical scale is generated by the coupling constant and the cutoff scale .",
    "it is natural , then , that @xmath41 is the only physical energy scale in the problem : the binding energy of three - particle , four - particle , etc .",
    "bound states are proportional to @xmath41 . in contrast to three spatial dimensions",
    ", there is no efimov effect ( or thomas collapse ) and no three - body parameter is required .",
    "the @xmath0-particle binding energy @xmath59 , however , can be very different from @xmath41 if @xmath0 is parametrically large .",
    "we use the variational method to calculate the size of the bound state . for a cluster of a large number of bosons",
    ", one can apply classical field theory .",
    "we thus have to minimize the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to all field configurations @xmath60 satisfying the constraint @xmath61 .",
    "this is equivalent to a hartree calculation with the running coupling constant @xmath62 instead of the bare one . in the limit of a large number @xmath0 of particles in the droplet ,",
    "some exact predictions can be obtained @xcite .",
    "the system possesses surprising universal properties .",
    "namely , if one denotes the size of the @xmath0-body droplet as @xmath63 , then at large @xmath0 and in the limit of zero range of the interaction potential : @xmath64 the size of the bound state decreases exponentially with @xmath0 : adding a boson into an existing @xmath0-boson droplet reduces the size of the droplet by almost a factor of three . correspondingly , the binding energy of @xmath0 bosons @xmath59 increases exponentially with @xmath0 : @xmath65 this implies that the energy required to remove one particle from a @xmath0-body bound state ( the analog of the nucleon separation energy for nuclei ) is about 88% of the total binding energy",
    "this is in contrast to most other physical systems , where separating one particle costs much less energy than the total binding energy , provided the number of particles in the bound state is large .",
    "the @xmath66-corrections to eqs .",
    "( [ rnratio ] , [ bnratio ] ) are calculable .    for the universal predictions ( [ rnratio ] , [ bnratio ] ) to apply in realistic systems with finite - range interactions , the @xmath0-body bound states need to be sufficiently shallow and hence have a size @xmath63 large compared to the natural low - energy length scale @xmath5 . depending on the physical system , @xmath5 can be the van der waals length @xmath67 , the range of the potential or some other scale . as a consequence , eqs .",
    "( [ rnratio ] , [ bnratio ] ) are valid in such systems for @xmath0 large , but below a critical value , @xmath68 at @xmath69 the size of the droplet is comparable to @xmath5 and universality is lost . if there is an exponentially large separation between @xmath70 and @xmath5 , then @xmath71 is much larger than one and the condition ( [ eq : break ] ) can be satisfied .",
    "we can compare our prediction with exact few - body calculations for @xmath72 . while the @xmath66-corrections are expected to be relatively large in this case",
    ", we can estimate how the universal result ( [ bnratio ] ) is approached .",
    "the three - body system for a zero - range potential in 2d has exactly two bound states : the ground state with @xmath73 and one excited state with @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "similarly , the four - body system for a zero - range potential in 2d has two bound states : the ground state with @xmath75 and one excited state with @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the prediction ( [ bnratio ] ) applies to the ground state energies @xmath45 and @xmath77 . the ratio @xmath78 is almost twice as large as the asymptotic value  ( [ bnratio ] ) , while the ratio @xmath79 is already considerably closer .",
    "these deviations are expected for such small values of @xmath0 .",
    "note , however , that the ratio of the root mean square radii of the two- and three - body wave functions is @xmath80  @xcite , close to the asymptotic value  ( [ rnratio ] ) .",
    "it would be interesting to test the universal predictions ( [ rnratio ] , [ bnratio ] ) both theoretically and experimentally for @xmath81 .",
    "on the theoretical side , monte carlo techniques appear to be a promising avenue .",
    "furthermore , the experimental realizablity of self - bound 2d boson systems with weak interactions should be investigated .",
    "we have discussed the eft for few - body systems with short - range interactions and large scattering length @xmath8 .",
    "the main focus was on applications to cold atoms .",
    "the renormalization of the three - body system with large @xmath8 in three spatial dimensions requires a one - parameter three - body force governed by a limit cycle already at leading order in the expansion in @xmath11 . as a consequence",
    ", two parameters are required to specify a three - body system : the scattering length @xmath8 ( or the dimer binding energy @xmath41 ) and the three - body parameter @xmath38 . however , once these two parameters are given the properties of the three- and four - body systems are fully determined at leading order in @xmath11 .",
    "the large scattering length leads to universal properties independent of the short - distance dynamics .",
