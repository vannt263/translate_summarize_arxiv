    "the superconductivity in iron pnictides has received tremendous interest since its discovery .",
    "@xcite the generic phase diagram of the iron - based superconductors ( fe - scs ) suggests the close proximity of the superconductivity ( sc ) to the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) antiferromagnetism ( afm ) .",
    "@xcite this should be contrasted with high - temperature cuprates , of which the sc originates from an afm mott insulator phase and can be quickly suppressed by substitution with other @xmath7-transition - metal atoms into the cuo@xmath3 plane . instead",
    ", the sc in the fe - scs can be induced when fe atoms are partially replaced by @xmath7-transition - metal atoms like ni and co.  @xcite moreover , in the case of the electron- and hole - doped 122 family like ba(fe@xmath8co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 or ba@xmath8k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 , the coexistence of the sdw and sc in a narrow doping region is reported by both experiments  @xcite and theoretical calculations .",
    "@xcite it has been argued that owing to their multiorbital nature and variable correlation effects , the superconducting pairing symmetry may not be universal in the fe - scs .",
    "@xcite this certainly poses a great challenge to relating the symmetry of the order parameter and the canonical doping phase diagram across different crystallographic iron - pnictide families",
    ". therefore , detailed measurements of the bulk transport and superconducting properties will remain useful for determining the superconducting pairing symmetry in the fe - scs .    while superconductivity can be induced in the 122 family by substitution of fe with co or ni ( and many other @xmath7 transition metals  @xcite ) in the feas layer",
    ", the role of these electron dopants is still controversial .",
    "@xcite it is hotly debated whether such substitution is dominated by the doping effect of extra charge carriers or impurity scattering or a combination thereof .",
    "@xcite in general , the study of disorder effects in superconductors is promising in addressing the pairing symmetry , as it has been applied successfully to the understanding of high-@xmath9 cuprate superconductivity .",
    "@xcite therefore , it is natural that the study of impurity scattering effects in fe - scs attracted much attention immediately after their discovery .",
    "of particular interest is the case of zn doping ,  @xcite because it does not induce sc , while it is expected to give rise to nonmagnetic , strong potential scattering in the unitary limit . for the zn - doped 122-type iron pnictides",
    ", the early results showed that zn impurities hardly affect the superconductivity of hole - doped ba@xmath10k@xmath10fe@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite however , more recent measurements of the magnetic susceptibility and resistivity  @xcite on high - quality single - crystalline ba(fe@xmath0zn@xmath2co@xmath1)@xmath3as@xmath3 compounds , suggested that the electron doped superconductivity is almost fully suppressed above a concentration of roughly @xmath11 zn , regardless of whether the sample is under , optimally or over doped .",
    "this discrepancy with earlier experiments is possibly due to the technical difficulty in substituting zn for fe atoms .",
    "further measurements  @xcite on the hole doped ba@xmath10k@xmath10(fe@xmath8zn@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 compound also showed that the superconductivity is suppressed by zn impurities .",
    "these interesting results have presented a challenge to theoretically identify the pairing symmetry in fe - scs .",
    "so far , the sign - reversal @xmath4-wave pairing symmetry has been supported by many experiments including neutron scattering ,  @xcite angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ,  @xcite and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ,  @xcite and is also consistent with the competition picture between magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "@xcite however , it has also been shown earlier  @xcite that because of the sign reversal of superconducting gap function across electron and hole bands , the @xmath12-wave pairing state is very fragile against impurities while the non - sign - reversal @xmath13-wave pairing symmetry should be a competitive candidate for fe - scs .",
    "the recent experiment  @xcite showed that the suppression in the superconducting transition temperature is much slower than that predicated by the theory for the @xmath4-wave pairing state .",
    "@xcite more recently , the effect of zn - doping induced disorder in fe - scs with both @xmath4- and @xmath13-wave pairing symmetries  @xcite has been investigated by solving the bdg equation for a two - orbital model  @xcite including both on - site ( favoring @xmath13-wave pairing symmetry ) and next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) inter - site ( favoring @xmath4-wave pairing symmetry ) pairing interaction .",
    "the zero - temperature real - space bdg calculations  @xcite indicated that the disorder could suppress the nnn pairing order parameter with negligible effect on the on - site pairing order parameter , suggesting a possibility of disorder induced pairing symmetry change from @xmath4- to @xmath13-wave .",
    "as such , depending on the strength of the on - site pairing interaction , this interesting proposal may provide a flexibility to explain various experimental data .",
    "@xcite    we note that , in ref .  , because the tuning of impurity concentration in the truly disordered system was actually mimicked by a tuning of the nnn pairing interaction in an impurity - free system , a direct comparison of superconducting transition temperature change with impurity concentration between theory and experiment is impossible . due to this interpretation gap , there are still several open questions . in this paper , we will study the disorder effects of the zn impurity on the superconducting properties of 122-type iron - based superconductors .",
    "in particular , we aim to address the question of how the superconducting transition temperature is completely suppressed at 8% of zn doping in 122-type compounds .",
    "@xcite to fulfill this goal , we start with an improved minimal two - orbital model for fe - scs .",
    "@xcite as in ref .",
    ", we solve the bdg equations self - consistently in real space to study the impurity - induced disorder effect , from which the superconducting order parameter , superconducting transition temperature , superfluid stiffness are calculated .",
    "we point out that with the sole @xmath4-wave pairing symmetry , the superconducting transition temperature can be suppressed at an impurity concentration as high as about 10% , which agrees well with the experiments on the ba(fe@xmath0zn@xmath2co@xmath1)@xmath3as@xmath3 compounds .",
    "@xcite this result is in striking contrast with an earlier prediction that the superconductivity is suppressed already at only 1% of impurity concentration .",
    "@xcite the root cause for this difference is given as follows : firstly , first - principles electronic structure calculations suggest that substitution of the nonmagnetic zn atom in the iron - based 122 superconductors , pushes the zn-@xmath7 impurity level considerably far below the fe-@xmath7 level , namely by about @xmath14 ev.@xcite hence zn substitution should be regarded as a strongly localized defect in the strong scattering ( unitary ) limit . such strong potential scattering is supported by more recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on ba(fe@xmath8zn@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite secondly , as shown later by our calculations , the superconducting coherence length can be very short , which is consistent with the experimental observation that fe - scs are extremely type - ii superconductors with ginzburg - landau parameter as large as 250 .",
    "@xcite in such a case , the applicability of the conventional approach based on the abrikosov - gorkov ( ag ) pair - breaking theory in dilute alloys ,  @xcite which assumes a spatially uniform suppression of the impurity - averaged order parameter and green s functions , is in question .",
    "the failure of the ag theory to address consistently the superconducting and transport properties in high - temperature cuprate and some heavy - fermion superconductors with short coherence length is well documented .",
    "@xcite therefore , in order to go beyond the applicability of the early theoretical studies and to reveal the interesting physics of highly disordered or _ dirty _ high - temperature iron - based superconductors , we shall study the nonmagnetic impurity - induced disorder effects in the unitary limit of multiorbital superconductors by solving the lattice bdg equation .",
    "this approach has proven to be quite successful in providing a consistent picture for the suppression of superconducting transition temperature and superfluid density in the inhomogeneous high - temperature cuprate and plutonium - based heavy - fermion superconductors.@xcite in this paper , we emphasize the key role of strong electronic inhomogeneity induced by zn substitution and how it could be probed in the 122 iron pnictides .",
