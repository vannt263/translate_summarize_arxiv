    "phase diagrams of antiferromagnets in externally applied magnetic fields have been studied , both experimentally and theoretically , for more than 50 years.@xcite in conventional collinear antiferromagnets the competition between zeeman , anisotropy , and exchange interactions gives rise to several phase transitions .",
    "for example , if the antiferromagnetic order parameter has a preferred direction ( easy axis ) , a magnetic field applied along that axis provokes a spin - flop transition at a critical field value @xmath2 , where the loss in anisotropy energy is compensated by a gain in zeeman energy .",
    "another transition in standard antiferromagnets is the spin - flip transition , which occurs when the zeeman energy exceeds the exchange energy .    in the more complicated cases of non - collinear and/or frustrated antiferromagnets",
    "the choice of an ordered phase and the orientation of the relevant order parameter are dictated by a fine balance between the different interactions or by fluctuation effects .",
    "@xcite this close competition implies rich phase diagrams with unusual features ( such as , e.g. , the appearance of magnetization plateaus ) , which have been studied both theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite    in view of the above , it came as a surprise when the quasi - one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 ( hereafter bcso ) , identified at low fields as an easy - axis collinear antiferromagnet , revealed `` extra '' spin - reorientation transitions , both in an applied field along the easy axis,@xcite as well as in transverse applied fields.@xcite by now , the phase diagram for applied fields along the main directions of the orthorhombic crystal unit cell is well established:@xcite at 2 k , with the field applied along the easy axis @xmath3 , two spin - reorientations are observed ( at @xmath4 koe and @xmath5 koe ) , with the field applied along the @xmath6 axis , one spin - reorientation is observed at @xmath7 koe and , finally , with the field applied along the @xmath8 direction another spin - reorientation transition takes place at @xmath9 koe .",
    "on the basis of neutron scattering experiments,@xcite the transitions occurring in a magnetic field applied along the easy axis were interpreted as consecutive rotations of the order parameter away from the easy axis , to a plane normal to it , followed by a rotation within this plane . a weak noncollinearity in the spin - flopped phase , at @xmath10 ,",
    "was suggested as well.@xcite subsequent analyses of magnetic resonance data confirmed that transitions in the transverse direction were indeed rotations of the sublattice magnetization away from the easy axis .",
    "the temperature dependence of the static magnetization ( see e.g.ref .  ) exhibits unusual features at low temperatures .",
    "the results of neutron - scattering experiments confirmed the one - dimensional character of the spin system of bcso@xcite and the magnetic susceptibilities along the @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 direction indeed exhibit the bonner - fisher maxima expected for spin chains at elevated temperatures.@xcite at lower temperatures , however , unexpected increases of @xmath11 and @xmath12 with decreasing temperature are observed above the nel temperature @xmath13 , atypical for this type of spin systems .",
    "more recent experiments probing the @xmath14si nmr line shift and its temperature dependence also revealed deviations from the expected conventional bonner - fisher behaviour.@xcite    the theoretical description of the physics underlying these phase transitions is neither complete nor satisfactory .",
    "a phenomenological approach was used to describe the low - temperature phase transitions and the antiferromagnetic resonance spectra.@xcite the peculiarities of the susceptibility above the nel temperature were discussed in relation with the known behavior of weak ferromagnets.@xcite yet , these approaches predict an unusual increase of certain parameters with respect to their conventional estimates , hence requiring an additional refinement of the theory .",
    "mean - field theory models have been attempted in the past,@xcite but they require the exact knowledge of many ( often unavailable ) microscopic parameters .",
    "by contrast , a thermodynamics - based approach has better chances to capture the overall physical picture , while being less demanding in terms of parameter knowledge .",
    "recent nmr studies@xcite have provided a direct access to the local magnetization , both above and below the nel temperature , revealing that a field - induced transverse magnetization appears on the magnetic ions .",
    "the related staggered magnetic field is an additional parameter that needs to be considered in a comprehensive discussion of the low - temperature magnetic features of bcso .    in this work , based on a conventional ginzburg - landau ( gl )",
    "approach which takes into account the new experimental findings , we reconsider the interpretation of the phase transitions in bcso .",
    "the field - induced transverse staggered magnetization ( tsm ) competes with the order parameter of the phase with spontaneously broken symmetry below @xmath13 .",
    "this competition may cause additional phase transitions in non - zero external magnetic fields and hence influence the magnetization process .",
    "we demonstrate that a gl - type analysis of the available data provides a semi - quantitative description of the phase diagram and predicts both the phase boundaries and their variation upon changing the external magnetic - field orientation with respect to the crystal axes .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : theor_model ] we describe and justify the phenomenological model , whose parameters are obtained from fitting the model calculations to experimental data .",
    "this is shown and discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] , leading finally to some conclusions at the end of the manuscript .",
    "we start our discussion from the paramagnetic phase .",
    "as the temperature decreases towards the transition temperature , the thermodynamic functions can be expanded over powers of the different order parameters ( i.e. , over different irreducible representations ) .",
    "the symmetry group of bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 , see ref .  )",
    "includes only one - dimensional representations which have been classified earlier.@xcite here , for the sake of consistency , we will use the same classification and axes notation ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) .",

    "tab : represent ] [ cols= \" < \" , ]     the few remaining parameters can be tuned to the extent that the calculated critical - field values and the field - induced shifts of @xmath13 agree best with those obtained from the experiment .",
    "the critical fields at the paramagnet - antiferromagnet phase boundary are @xmath28  koe , @xmath29  koe , @xmath30  koe , and @xmath31  koe , while the values of the nel temperature shifts at 14  t ( @xmath32 are @xmath33  k for @xmath34 , @xmath35  k for @xmath36 , and @xmath37  k for @xmath38).@xcite all the parameter values and their relevant combinations are listed in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "si@xmath0o@xmath1 ( ref .  ) ( magnetization data  open circles and squares , specific heat measurements  closed triangles ) vs.  modelled phase boundaries ( solid lines ) .",
    "orientations of the principal order parameter @xmath39 and of the field induced tsm @xmath40 are shown for the corresponding phases . ]    with these parameters the magnetization curves can be calculated and the relevant phase boundaries can be established .",
    "figures  [ fig : magn ] and [ fig : t - h ] show that the modelled curves are reasonably close to experiment .",
    "the main failure of the model consists in the predicted temperature dependence of the high - field spin - reorientation transitions , which is not observed in the experiment .",
    "probably this can be accounted for by considering the role of thermal fluctuations , which are known to stabilize collinear magnetic structures@xcite ( field - induced tsm and exchange - driven order parameter are collinear in the low - field phases for @xmath41 ) .",
    "our model provides an adequate description also for the observed nmr shifts , both above and below the nel point , which , for @xmath42,@xcite is mostly due to the staggered magnetization pattern related to @xmath43 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : l12 ] ) .",
    "the scaling of the nmr shift@xcite and of @xmath44 above @xmath13 ( see fig .  [",

    "an estimate for the field - induced tsm , @xmath48  @xmath49 per cu@xmath20 ion ( in an applied field of 7.02  t ) , was obtained in recent nmr work.@xcite since in our model the saturated value of the main order parameter is normalized , while its measured value@xcite is ca .",
    "@xmath50 per cu@xmath20 ion , this corresponds to @xmath51 in normalized units . from the latter value and from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : l1z ] ) we find @xmath52 emu/(mol cu ) .",
    "the @xmath53 value can be estimated from the canting of the magnetic structure , as observed in neutron scattering experiments@xcite with @xmath45 .",
    "these experiments revealed an @xmath54 component of ca .",
    "0.17 ( corresponding to a canting angle of @xmath55 at @xmath56  t ) .",
    "however , because of the coincidence of the structural and magnetic bragg peaks in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 , the determination of the magnetic scattering intensities required the subtraction of the peak intensities recorded just above @xmath13 . since the contribution of the field - induced order parameter is subtracted as well , the observed low - temperature magnitude of @xmath54 represents , in fact , only the change of @xmath54 across @xmath13 due to the competition between the field - induced and exchange - driven orders .",
    "our calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : l12 ] ) show that @xmath54 at 6  k amounts to @xmath57 of its value at @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , by assuming @xmath58 , we obtain @xmath59 emu/(mol cu ) .",
    "note that an @xmath60 component should also exist for @xmath45 . however , its magnitude at @xmath13 and @xmath61 t is , as calculated using the found parameters , ca .",
    "0.17 ( i.e.  only half of @xmath54 ) .",
    "besides , our model calculations show that @xmath60 strongly changes below t@xmath62 only at @xmath10 when the principal order parameter is also aligned along the @xmath63-axis .",
    "these reasons probably explain why @xmath60 has not been observed experimentally .",
    "the above estimates for @xmath47 are consistent with their expected small values .",
    "in fact , both of them are comparable with @xmath64 evaluated at @xmath65 k.    k in the rotation from @xmath6- toward the @xmath3-axis reflect the crossing of the pm - afm boundary before a spin - reorientation could occur . ]",
    "finally , we also computed the angular dependence of the critical fields for spin - reorientation transitions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) .",
    "all the marked fields correspond to real transitions , accompanied by a jump in the susceptibility and by a sudden reorientation of the main order parameter @xmath39 . to ensure that the angular dependence is not affected by changes in magnitude of the main order parameter @xmath39 ( due to closeness to the pm - afm phase boundary ) ,",
    "the modelling was carried out at different temperatures ( 6 , 8 , and 9 k ) .",
    "all curves are qualitatively similar , with differences mostly due to the above mentioned temperature dependence of the upper critical fields @xmath66 and , partially ( for the 9 k curve ) , to the crossing of the pm - afm phase boundary before a spin - reorientation transition has occurred .",
    "our model predicts quite a remarkable angular dependence for the critical fields . on rotating from the hard axis",
    "@xmath8 towards the secondary easy - axis @xmath6 , the critical field @xmath67 transforms smoothly into @xmath68 . upon further rotation towards the easy axis @xmath3 , the field required for",
    "a spin - reorientation transition first grows very rapidly and , at an intermediate critical angle , diverges to infinity .",
    "subsequently , it reappears from the high - field zone and finally converges to the critical field @xmath69 .",
    "a rotation from the easy axis @xmath3 towards the hard axis @xmath8 ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) demonstrates the merging of the two critical fields @xmath70 and @xmath69 at a certain angle .",
    "then the spin - reorientation transition reappears from high fields and , finally , close to the @xmath8 axis , evolves towards @xmath67 . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the angular dependence of the critical fields in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 has not yet been studied .",
    "its experimental investigation would represent an independent additional test of the proposed model .",
    "by making use of the ginzburg - landau theory of phase transitions we propose a semi - quantitative description of the magnetic phase diagram of 1d systems with competing interactions .",
    "we have demonstrated that the competition between the field - induced and the exchange - driven order parameters in a quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnet can lead to an unusual phase diagram and to remarkable deviations of the magnetization process from that expected in a 1d heisenberg antiferromagnet . additionally ,",
    "in the bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 model system , we predict an unusual angular dependence of the critical fields , which will be object of future experimental investigations .",
