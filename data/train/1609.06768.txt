    "since the seminal work of donaldson , establishing a correspondence between lefschetz pencils and symplectic 4-manifolds@xcite , lefschetz fibrations and its generalizations have played a significant role in symplectic geometry .",
    "these are maps to the 2-sphere with a finite number of isolated singular points where the rank of the derivative is zero . in 2005 ,",
    "auroux , donaldson , and katzarkov generalized this approach , introducing what is now known as a _ broken lefschetz fibration _ or _ blf _ @xcite .",
    "there is an additional component in the singularity set of blfs , a 1-submanifold of indefinite folds .",
    "it was shown that a reciprocal geometric structure to blfs is a near - symplectic form .",
    "the latter are closed 2-forms that are non - degenerate outside a collection of circles where they vanish , and they are known to exist on any 4-manifold with @xmath0 . recently ,",
    "near - symplectic structures and generalized broken lefschetz fibrations have been studied in higher dimensions @xcite .    from a singularity theory point of view blfs",
    "are not stable . by a stable map",
    "it is understood one such that any nearby map in the space of smooth mappings can be perturbed to the original map after a change of coordinates in the domain and codomain .",
    "blfs can be deformed to stable maps .",
    "lekili showed that the unstable lefschetz singularities of a blf can be be substituted by cusps , leading to a stable map with only folds and cusps as elements of its critical set @xcite .",
    "these mappings are known as _",
    "wrinkled fibrations_. furthermore he showed that the near - symplectic structure is preserved under these deformations .",
    "poisson geometry has newly entered the picture , particularly in dimension 4 .",
    "a singular poisson bivector of rank 2 that vanishes on the singularity set of a blf and whose symplectic foliation matches the fibres of the map can be given @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that on any homotopy class of maps from a 4-manifold to @xmath1 there is such a singular poisson structure .",
    "similar structures also appear on wrinkled fibrations , where the local models of the poisson bivectors and induced symplectic forms have been explicitly constructed @xcite .    in this work",
    "we start by defining a generalization of wrinkled fibrations on dimension 6 based on singularity theory .",
    "we then construct poisson and near - symplectic structures that match the singularities of the fibration and give their local models . before presenting these constructions , in section [ sec : genblf ] we briefly recall the notion of a generalized broken lefschetz fibration , which serves as a reference for the definition of generalized wrinkled fibrations .",
    "our first observation appears after combining the definition of generalized blf @xcite together with the results of @xcite and @xcite on poisson structures .",

    "if none of its symplectic leaves are , or contain , @xmath7spheres , then this poisson structure is integrable .",
    "the proof of this theorem is a direct application of theorem [ t : const - poisson ] and the definition of completeness .",
    "the integrability condition is verified in the relevant cases , as explained in [ integrability ] .    in section [ s : symp - struct - sing ]",
    "we focus on the poisson structure on the total space of a generalized wrinkled fibration in dimension 6 .",
    "we give the general steps for buidling poisson bivectors around all types of singularities of corank 1 , which can be applied on any given dimension .",
    "this idea allows us to show the following .",
    "[ wrinkled - poisson ] let @xmath2 be a closed , orientable , smooth @xmath8manifold equipped with a generalized wrinkled fibration @xmath9 over a smooth 4-manifold @xmath3",
    ". then there exists a complete poisson structure whose symplectic leaves correspond to the fibres of the given fibration structure , and the singularities of both the fibration and the poisson structures coincide .",
    "moreover , for each singularity , the poisson bivector and induced symplectic form on the leaves are given by the following equations :    [ cols=\"<,^ , < , < , < \" , ]     if none of its symplectic leaves are , or contain , @xmath7spheres , then this poisson structure is integrable .",
    "the existence of a poisson structure with the stated properties follows from theorem [ t : const - poisson ] , previously shown by the first and third named authors together with garca - naranjo @xcite .",
    "the proof of this theorem follows from an application of theorem [ t : const - poisson ] and the definition of completeness .",
    "these results allow us to present in section [ morita - examples ] countably many examples of poisson structures on the same underlying smooth manifold that are morita inequivalent . in our examples the leaves of the symplectic foliations change topology , as the fibrations involved undergo deformations .    in section [ s : symp - struct - sing ] ,",
    "the local models for the bivectors are shown to hold true . then in section [ s : symp - forms ] we prove that the local models for the symplectic forms on the leaves are also the claimed ones .",

    "the global construction of the near - symplectic structure on the total space follows as in dimension 4 @xcite with the modifications for higher dimensions introduced by the third named author @xcite .",
    "the most substantial difference concerns the construction of the local forms around the new singularities .",
    "notice that our theorem [ wrinkled - poisson ] presents extensive possibilities for poisson structures supported on wrinkled fibrations .",
    "whereas our theorem [ thm : near - symplectic ] is limited in the singularities used by the restrictions imposed by near - symplectic structures .",
    "in particular , there will be no analogue of the results of auroux - donaldson - katzarkov ( for blf s ) or of lekili ( for wrinkled fibrations ) in dimension 4 , which give general conditions for all these fibrations to admit compatible near - symplectic structures .",
    "here we examine near - symplectic forms and singular poisson bivectors in relation to extensions of lefschetz fibrations using maps coming from singularity theory .",
    "the recent work of cavalcanti and klaasse @xcite also considered lefschetz fibrations in singular symplectic and poisson geometry .",
    "in contrast to our work , cavalcanti and klaasse have connected achiral lefschetz fibrations to log - symplectic and folded symplectic structures .",
    "an even dimensional manifold @xmath2 is said to be _ log - symplectic _ if it is equipped with a poisson bivector @xmath16 such that the pfaffian @xmath17 is transverse to the zero section in @xmath18 , @xmath2 is called _ folded symplectic _ if it comes with a closed 2-form @xmath15 such that @xmath19 vanishes transversally in @xmath20 .",
    "the geometric structures studied in this work differ from the ones considered by cavalcanti and klaasse .",
