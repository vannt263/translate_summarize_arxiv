    "the purpose of the present investigation is to study the longitudinal structure function ( sf ) @xmath5 as well as the charm and beauty contributions to the proton sf @xmath0 using the @xmath6factorization approach of qcd @xcite .",
    "the sf @xmath5 is directly connected to the gluon density in the proton . only in the naive quark - parton - model @xmath7 , and becomes non - zero in pqcd .",
    "however the pqcd leads to controversal results still .",
    "it was shown recently  @xcite , that the @xmath3 experimental data from hera seem to be inconsistent with some of the nlo predictions ( in particular the mrst one ) at small @xmath8 .",
    "bfkl effects significantly improve the description of the low @xmath8 data when compared to a standard nlo @xmath9-scheme global fit .",
    "the nnlo global fit becomes better when taking into account higher order terms involving powers of @xmath10 .",
    "it means , that we need a resummation procedure .    on the other hand",
    "it is known , that the bfkl effects are taken into account from the very beginning in the @xmath6factorization approach  @xcite , which is based on the bfkl  @xcite or ccfm  @xcite evolution equations summing up the large logarithmic terms proportional to @xmath10 or @xmath11 in the lla .",
    "some applications of the @xmath6factorization approach were shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the framework of @xmath12-factorization the study of the longitudinal sf",
    "@xmath3 began already ten years ago  @xcite , where the small @xmath8 asymptotics of @xmath3 has been evaluated , using the bfkl results . since we want to analyze the sf data in a broader range at small @xmath8 we use a more phenomenological approach in our analyses of @xmath13 and @xmath3 data  @xcite .",
    "using the @xmath12-factorization approach for the description of different sf at small @xmath8 we hope to obtain additional information ( or restrictions ) , in particular , about one of the main ingradient of @xmath12-factorization approach - the unintegrated gluon distribution ( ugd )    in the @xmath12-factorization the sf @xmath14 are driven at small @xmath8 primarily by gluons and are related in the following way to the ugd @xmath15 @xmath16 the functions @xmath17 can be regarded as sf of the off - shell gluons with virtuality @xmath18 ( hereafter we call them _ hard structure functions _ ) .",
    "they are described by the sum of the quark box ( and crossed box ) diagram contribution to the photon - gluon interaction .    to apply eq.(1 ) for sf at low @xmath19 we change the low @xmath19 asymptotics of the qcd coupling constant within hard structure functions .",
    "we have used the so called `` freezing '' procedure in the `` soft '' form , when the argument of the strong coupling constant is shifted from @xmath19 to @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "then @xmath21 . for massless quarks @xmath22 and for massive ones with mass @xmath23 .    to calculate the sf @xmath24 and @xmath25 we used the hard sf @xmath26 from ref .  @xcite and two ugd @xmath27 obtained in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "these ugd are determined by a convolution of the non - perturbative starting distribution @xmath28 and ccfm evolution denoted by @xmath29 : @xmath30          where @xmath31 the parameters @xmath32 of @xmath33 were determined in the fits to @xmath13 and @xmath34 data  @xcite independently ( see  @xcite ) fig .",
    "1 shows the two different ugd .",
    "the small @xmath8 behaviour of these ugd is very different .    to calculate the sf @xmath35 and @xmath36 we took @xmath37 gev and",
    "@xmath38 gev and used the @xmath39 limit of the above eq . 1 to evaluate the corresponding lightquark contributions to the @xmath3 .",
    "2 ( left panel ) shows the @xmath40 as a function of @xmath8 at fixed @xmath19 .",
    "fig.2 ( right panel ) shows the @xmath3 as a function of @xmath8 at fixed @xmath19 .",
    "3 shows the sf @xmath41 at fixed @xmath4 compared to the h1 data  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe , that the measured @xmath40 seems to prefer the ugd obtained from the fit to @xmath13 and is inconsitent with the one obtained from @xmath34 .",
    "also the measured @xmath3 is better described with the ugd from the @xmath13 fit .     as a function of @xmath8 at fixed @xmath19 compared to the h1 data  @xcite(left panel ) the solid and dotted lines are from ccfm - evolved ugd obtained from the fits to @xmath42 and @xmath1 . the sf @xmath3 as a function of @xmath8 at fixed @xmath19 compared to the h1 data  @xcite(right panel ) the solid and dotted lines are from ccfm - evolved ugd obtained from the fits to @xmath42 and @xmath1.__,width=264,height=302 ]     as a function of @xmath8 at fixed @xmath19 compared to the h1 data  @xcite(left panel ) the solid and dotted lines are from ccfm - evolved ugd obtained from the fits to @xmath42 and @xmath1 .",
    "the sf @xmath3 as a function of @xmath8 at fixed @xmath19 compared to the h1 data  @xcite(right panel ) the solid and dotted lines are from ccfm - evolved ugd obtained from the fits to @xmath42 and @xmath1.__,width=264,height=302 ]     dependence of sf @xmath41 at fixed @xmath43 gev compared to the h1 data  @xcite the solid and dotted lines are from ccfm - evolved ugd obtained from the fits to @xmath42 and @xmath1.__,width=491,height=188 ]    in summary the @xmath6 factorization approach with the ccfm - evolved ugd obtained from the fits to the @xmath0 data reproduces the h1 data for sf @xmath35 , @xmath44 and @xmath3 at fixed @xmath4 ( see  @xcite ) .",
