    "transport of charged particles in many astrophysical systems is governed by the highly turbulent magnetic field which leads to the diffusion of charged particles in space .",
    "some of the most notable ideas in the study of diffusion of charged particles in magnetic turbulence are quasilinear theory @xcite , field line random walk theory    ( flrw ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and nonlinear guiding center theory @xcite .",
    "these theories focus on calculating the diffusion of charged particles in directions parallel and perpendicular to a constant mean magnetic field @xmath0 , under influence of a fluctuating magnetic field @xmath1 that depends on position @xmath2 but not on time .",
    "a considerable modification to these theories is required when the fluctuations are isotropic with zero ( or very small ) mean field .",
    "such modification turns out to be of the highest importance when describing the transport of cosmic rays ( crs ) in the galaxy , as well as for the modeling of diffusive cr acceleration in astrophysical sources .",
    "here we consider the problem of magnetostatic scattering with @xmath3 , and for fluctuations @xmath4 that are statistically isotropic , in terms of both polarization and spectral distribution .",
    "the propagation of crs in the galaxy is usually modeled as diffusive in a turbulent magnetic field where the rms fluctuations of strength @xmath5 are of the same order of magnitude as the large scale field @xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath7 , although it is not clear whether this condition is fulfilled both in the disc and the halo of the galaxy . on the other hand , supernova shocks ,",
    "usually invoked to be the main sites of acceleration of galactic crs @xcite , are observed to possess intense turbulent magnetic fields , where the large scale field , if any , only affects the development of the fast growing instabilities that lead to the existence of intense turbulent fields @xcite . at the shock itself , the field is probably well modeled as isotropic with a negligible mean field .",
    "there have been some studies of diffusion of charged particles in magnetic turbulence without the mean field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a clear theory covering all ranges of particle energies is still lacking .",
    "in particular , the simulations carried out by @xcite clearly showed that in the limit of large @xmath8 the diffusion coefficient of particles with larmor radius much smaller than the energy containing scale of the turbulent field closely resembles the one naively estimated from quasi - linear theory , a rather curious result since such theory applies to the opposite limit .",
    "when the field is purely turbulent , the combination of particle diffusion and random walk of magnetic field lines is expected to play a crucial role .",
    "diffusion of magnetic field lines in isotropic turbulence with zero mean field was examined by @xcite , and that paper is in some ways an antecedent of the present work .",
    "we note that the high energy theory described below was originally presented by david montgomery .",
    "the transport of charged particles in interplanetary space and the interstellar medium , including in regions of particle acceleration , is highly influenced by the presence of turbulent magnetic fields and their spectral distribution .",
    "the nature of particle transport in these fields also depends on particle energy . in general , higher energy particles , with gyro - radius larger than the correlation length of the magnetic field , will sample many uncorrelated field lines within one gyration .",
    "lower energy particles with gyro - radius much smaller than the magnetic field correlation length , on the other hand , will see a relatively coherent large scale field , and their transport will be heavily affected by resonances with local magnetic fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "we classify the diffusive behavior of charged particles into three different regimes based on the ratio of the larmor radius @xmath9 of the charged particle to the characteristic outer length scale of turbulence @xmath10 : a high energy region with @xmath11 , an intermediate energy region with @xmath12 , and the low energy region with @xmath13 .",
    "corresponding to the two extreme inequalities , we will develop two corresponding theoretical approaches for particle diffusion in the extreme energy ranges .",
    "first , in the high energy limit , the path of the particle experiences only small deviations from its initial trajectory due to small angle scattering on magnetic field irregularities . in this case a diffusive state is achieved when the magnetic fluctuations probed by the particles become uncorrelated . at the opposite extreme",
    ", particles with very small gyro - radius will gyrate about the local field produced by the large scale fluctuations while experiencing perturbations , the most effective of which will be at scales comparable to the gyroradius .",
    "this leads to resonant interactions and a random walk of the particle pitch angle .",
    "the particle will eventually trace its path backwards and parallel spatial diffusion is achieved .",
    "the range of validity of both the high energy and the low energy asymptotic theories will be extended by building in additional decorrelation effects in the relevant lagrangian correlation functions , thereby providing an accurate description of the particle mean free paths also in the intermediate range of energies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : theory ] we write down the fundamental equations describing the diffusive motion of the particles in velocity ( or momentum ) space . in  [ high_energy ]",
    "we specialize the theory to the high energy regime . in ",
    "[ int_energy ] we show that a non - linear theory can be developed that reproduces the high energy behavior of the diffusion coefficient (  [ high_energy ] ) for @xmath14 while also describing the results of numerical simulations down to @xmath15 . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : low_energy ] we describe our formulation of a low energy theory that , while accounting for particle - wave resonances , also keeps memory of perpendicular decorrelation , thereby describing simulation results for @xmath16 . a detailed comparison of our theoretically calculated spatial diffusion coefficients with the results of numerical simulations",
    "is discussed in ",

    "the second estimates the angular deflection of a field line over scales in the inertial range and justifies neglecting such deflection in the low energy theory .",
    "the third compares the numerical simulation results with the theories developed in this work when applied to interplanetary parameters .",
    "since the turbulence is isotropic , and the the particle speed @xmath17 is constant in the absence of electric fields , the velocity space diffusion tensor is expected to have an isotropic form @xcite ,    @xmath18    which implies that @xmath19\\label{dij_dv}.\\ ] ]    the distribution function of test particles obeys the fokker - planck equation in velocity space , which when spatial gradients are present can be written as @xmath20 plugging in the isotropic form of the velocity space diffusion ( equation [ iso_dv ] ) into equation [ fokker_plank_gradient ] we get , @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for that part of the velocity space laplacian in spherical co - ordinates that involves no radial derivatives .    to make a connection with spatial diffusion we construct a multiple time scale solution of equation [ fokker_plank_angular ] , by breaking down time and spatial scales into fast ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and slow variables ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "we seek a solution with @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath29 order distribution function can be expanded in the spherical harmonics as : @xmath30 the details of the multiple time scale solution are given in appendix a where a relationship between the velocity space diffusion coefficient @xmath31 and spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath32 is obtained : @xmath33 the mean free path ( @xmath34 ) in terms of the diffusion coefficient is simply @xmath35 particle statistics may be related to the spatial diffusion coefficient by the taylor - green - kubo ( tgk ) formula @xcite : @xmath36 this formula , with @xmath37 interpreted as the guiding center velocity in the @xmath38-direction , was used to calculate the diffusion coefficient in theories that have a mean magnetic field , e.g. , bam theory @xcite , the original nlgc theory @xcite , etc .    the velocity space diffusion coefficient can also be written in a tgk formulation as : @xmath39 to calculate the rate of change of velocity in equation [ vel_iso ] we use the newton - lorentz equation of motion @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the particle charge and mass , respectively , @xmath43 is the lorentz factor , @xmath44 is the speed of light , @xmath45 is the magnetic fluctuation field and we define @xmath46 .",

    "the high energy theory and nonlinear theory differ in the treatment of the correlation tensors in equation [ dij_int ] ( more details are in sections [ high_energy ] and [ int_energy ] ) . section [ sec : low_energy ] contains a theoretical description of diffusive transport for low energy particles .",
    "very high energy particles with larmor radii much larger than the correlation scale will experience only minor deflections from their original path as they complete a distance equivalent to the correlation length of the magnetic field .",
    "this corresponds to the high energy theory developed in this section , applicable when @xmath49 .",
    "the appropriate simplifying assumptions in this case are that the displacement follows a straight line @xmath50 , and , that the velocity autocorrelation is simply @xmath51 . using these , equation [ dij_int ]",
    "can be written as :    @xmath52    in view of equation [ dij_dv ] , computing the trace of equation [ iso_dv3 ] gives an expression for the high energy velocity space diffusion coefficient , @xmath53 where @xmath5 is the rms magnetic field and the correlation length is @xmath54    notice that @xmath31 is independent of the spectrum of turbulence because the only thing that matters is the fact that most energy is in magnetic fluctuations at a fixed scale @xmath55 and at that scale we may assume that the effective magnetic field seen by the particle is the rms field @xmath5 .",
    "plugging @xmath31 in equation [ wib_mont ] , in terms of gyrofrequency @xmath56 , the spatial diffusion coefficient is then    @xmath57    this result is not entirely new to the astrophysics community ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we give a more formal derivation .",
    "an intuitive derivation of equation [ high_energy_diff ] proceeds as follows .",
    "suppose that most of the power in the magnetic field spectrum is on a spatial scale @xmath10 , which is much smaller than the larmor radius of particles",
    ". then one can think of a very large but otherwise arbitrary distance @xmath58 as being tiled with cells of size @xmath10 .",
    "in each cell , when @xmath59 , one has a deflection of the order @xmath60 .",
    "the average angle of deflection when there are @xmath61 scatterings satisfies    @xmath62    where @xmath63 .",
    "now , the average deflection angle is of order unity when @xmath64 at that point the distance is also @xmath65 ( because the displacement from the unperturbed trajectory is small ) , and the diffusion coefficient is : @xmath66 which is identical to equation [ high_energy_diff ] .",
    "for rigidity decreasing towards unity from large values , the assumption above that the unperturbed particle trajectory is a straight line with constant velocity becomes less accurate .",
    "instead , we assume the velocity autocorrelation is exponential with a characteristic decorrelation time @xmath23 , @xmath67 however , making use of the tgk formula , equation [ tgk ] , one sees that the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath68 is related to the time scale @xmath23 by @xmath69 that is , from equation [ wib_mont ] @xmath70 then , using equations [ dij_dv ] , [ dij_int ] and [ vel_dec ] one finds that @xmath71 = \\alpha^2\\int_0^\\infty dt\\frac{v^2}{3}e^{-t/\\tau}\\langle b_i(0)b_i[{\\bf x}(t ) ] \\rangle,\\label{d_v_inc}\\ ] ] where there is an implied summation over @xmath72 . the closure for the lagrangian correlation in this equation should now be reconsidered . in particular , we question the approximation of a straight - line unperturbed trajectory @xmath50 that was previously used in the high energy theory . to allow for the effect of perturbations of this trajectory ,",
    "@xmath73 may be treated as a random variable . following the familiar procedure used in other nonlinear diffusion theories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the latter was first introduced in describing the magnetic field line random walk by @xcite . here , the result is @xmath76",
    "the random ballistic model is justified since the particles undergo ballistic motion at earlier times before they reach the asymptotic diffusive regime .",
    "with @xmath23 given by equation [ tau ] , substituting equation [ rbd ] into equation [ init_rbd ] and then into equation [ d_v_inc ] gives    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the omnidirectional energy spectrum .",
    "if we take the limit @xmath79 in equation [ dv_intermediate ] , equation [ dv_relation ] is recovered , which is the high energy limit .",
    "hence , the nonlinear theory allows departures from the high energy limit , but also recovers the exact form of the high energy limit as @xmath23 becomes large .",
    "more generally , equation [ dv_intermediate ] is an implicit equation for @xmath31 and equation [ wib_mont ] gives the spatial diffusion coefficient .",
    "+ it is worth pointing out that another standard approximation would be to treat the trajectories of the particles as having a diffusive distribution ( dd ) for the purpose of calculating the lagrangian magnetic correlation function    @xcite . in that case , the ensemble average on the left hand side of equation would then be @xmath80 .",
    "this alternative approach , however , fails to predict the high energy behavior of the particles where the particles are ballistic for a long time before undergoing multiple deflections to reach the diffusive limit . for the intermediate range",
    "dd converges with the rbd model .",
    "low energy particles ( @xmath81 ) behave entirely differently because they experience a local mean magnetic field due to large scale fluctuations .",
    "these small gyroradius particles typically scatter before moving far enough for the local mean field to average to zero . in such circumstances , there are two dominant effects that are expected to contribute to transport and diffusion : field line random walk ( flrw ) and a kind of resonant wave particle scattering in which the local field acts as a mean field that organizes the particle gyro - motion .    in the presence of flrw alone , particles would follow magnetic field lines and achieve spatial diffusion as the magnetic field lines diffuse in space .",
    "decorrelation of the particle trajectories due to this mechanism @xcite gives rise to an energy - independent mean free path .",
    "this would not explain the results of our numerical simulations , as discussed below .",
    "one may , however , estimate from a simple kolmogorov turbulence theory the degree to which the field lines bend for distances shorter than a correlation scale , as is done in appendix b. the conclusion is that the angular deflection of the mean field seen by a particle in moving over a scale @xmath82 is small provided that @xmath83 is small , i.e. , the scale @xmath82 lies deep in the inertial range .",
    "this conclusion is also empirically supported , in that the numerical results ( figure [ rel_diffusion ] ) show that at low energy the particle mean free path is smaller than the correlation length of the magnetic field . for lower energy the local mean field , due to",
    "the large scale parts of the spectrum , becomes increasingly coherent .",
    "making the assumption that the local mean field remains well defined for long enough distance , we may examine whether that resonant scattering of particles on fluctuations with wavenumber around the inverse of the larmor radius @xcite provides effective scattering , in the regime in which turbulence is weak compared with a locally evaluated large scale mean magnetic field .",
    "of course if the small scale power is suppressed , then one recovers the flrw result ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the presence of a guide field , the original quasilinear theory @xcite represents the standard tool for calculating resonant pitch angle diffusion coefficients of particles .",
    "it is successful in predicting the resonant scattering of the particles in the case of a slab fluctuation field ( wave vectors parallel to the mean field ) but may require some modification in other fluctuation geometries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "non - linear theories are also useful in attaining better agreement with the results of numerical simulations of particle propagation @xcite .    in the present case of isotropic turbulence , with no guide field ,",
    "the assumptions of qlt can no longer be applied , although we are encouraged to proceed based on the above reasoning concerning the local mean field . to be specific , it is useful to first put forward a physical explanation of the approach we propose to describe the low energy regime : if the power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations is such that most power is on scales of order @xmath84 , then particles with larmor radius much smaller than @xmath85 move following a roughly ordered magnetic field line at least until a distance of @xmath84 has been covered . on such scales",
    "the propagation is diffusive in the direction of the local magnetic field , although particles suffer little motion in the direction perpendicular to that of the local field .",
    "let us refer to this parallel diffusion coefficient as @xmath86 , although the physical meaning of this quantity should be kept in mind .",
    "the effective velocity of particles in the direction of the local field is @xmath87 .",
    "when particles move over many times the coherence scale @xmath85 , their transport in the directions perpendicular to the original local field becomes evident ( due to isotropic turbulence ) and one can estimate the global diffusion coefficient as : @xmath88 in other words , provided the propagation is diffusive on small scales , the global diffusion coefficient on large scales proceeds with a similar diffusion coefficient to that calculated using the local magnetic field as an _ effective local guide field_. the problem is now reduced to calculating the diffusion coefficient experienced by particles along the local magnetic field .",
    "this can be done by using a close analogy to the case of qlt .",
    "the parallel spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath86 , is calculated using a well known relationship between @xmath86 and the pitch angle diffusion coefficient @xmath89 @xcite , @xmath90 the diffusion coefficient along a fixed direction ( e.g. , the @xmath38-direction ) is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the angle between the magnetic field direction and the @xmath38-axis . since the particles are expected to travel parallel to the local mean field and undergo resonant pitch angle scattering , which eventually causes a random walk in the parallel direction with little average perpendicular motion , we neglect @xmath93 in equation [ k_along_axis ] and average over all directions to obtain @xmath94 consistent with equation [ eq : kappap ] .    using the taylor - green - kubo formula ,",

    "[ scaling ] we show the results of our simulations for @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 real space grid points , from which it is possible to see that the lower resolution ( @xmath167 ) case does not match correctly the scaling of the mean free path with larmor radius .",
    "this is because the @xmath167 simulation does not numerically resolve the resonant scales corresponding to the larmor radius of the particles .",
    "on the other hand , no appreciable difference can be seen in the two higher resolution cases with @xmath168 and @xmath169 simulations .",
    "hence , we will use the @xmath188 realization for subsequent discussion of the results .",
    "the mean free path calculated using the theoretical framework developed above is compared with the results of simulations in figure .",
    "these results may be considered as representative of propagation of very high energy cr protons in the galactic magnetic field with correlation length @xmath190 pc and root mean square magnetic field @xmath191 nt .",
    "the larmor radius of the particles equals the correlation length of the magnetic field fluctuations at energy @xmath192 ev , somewhat above the knee in the all - particle spectrum of galactic crs .",
    "however , we note that when plotted this way , as mean free path vs. larmor radius , with both quantities normalized to the correlation scale of the turbulence , the actual curves are identical for any energy range . in appendix c",
    "we provide a short account of the results of our analysis when applied to isotropic turbulence that has parameters akin to heliospheric parameters .",
    "the spatial diffusion of charged particles in the presence of turbulent magnetic fields is significant in describing the transport of charged particles in the interplanetary , interstellar and intergalactic media .",
    "most of the standard description of diffusion involves the existence of a non - negligible ordered field . in this paper",
    "we considered the case of a vanishingly small background ordered magnetic field and studied the diffusive transport of charged particles in isotropic magnetic field ( magnetostatic ) turbulence .",
    "the highly turbulent galactic magnetic field , where the mean magnetic field is of the order of fluctuations , is found to have reversals in the field orientation implying the existence of regions with negligible regular fields @xcite .",
    "similarly the extragalactic voids might have negligible regular fields @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the isotropic assumption is relevant in other highly disturbed and turbulent plasmas , such as some planetary magnetosheaths and planetary wakes as well as very close to the acceleration regions of cosmic rays ( for instance supernova shocks ) .",
    "the transport of charged particles is conceptually simple , requiring mostly the integration of particle trajectories using the lorentz force ( equation [ new_lor ] ) .",
    "the detailed treatment is complex , influenced by several parameters like the particle energy , correlation length of turbulence , the geometry of fluctuations , the presence of a dissipation range , and the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "in particular the study of transport of particles in isotropic magnetic field turbulence is found to be complicated by the different conditions seen by charged particles at high , low and intermediate energies as defined .",
    "here the controlling parameter is the rigidity , or ratio of larmor radius ( @xmath9 ) to the turbulence correlation length ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "when the ratio @xmath193 is much smaller than one we refer to the low energy limit , when it is greater than one this is the high energy limit and in between low and high energy lies the intermediate energy region .",
    "we have devised two different theoretical models in an attempt to understand the transport processes in these three regions . rather than just using parametric and scaling arguments ,",
    "we provide systematic and thorough theoretical constructs to describe the diffusive transport of particles in each range of energy .",
    "the paths of the higher energy particles are almost straight up to the correlation length of the magnetic field , where the particles undergo only a slight change from the original trajectory .",
    "in contrast , the lower energy particles are almost strictly tied to their initial field lines and are pitch angle scattered due to resonance with small scale irregularities of the field line . the intermediate energy particles have a more complicated nonlinear diffusion that connects the two extremes .    the theoretical ideas presented here have been tested against results of detailed numerical experiments using monte carlo simulations of particle propagation in stochastic magnetic fields . the magnetic field constructed for numerical purposes",
    "has three dimensional isotropic fluctuations with a standard kolmogorov spectrum and no mean field .",
    "diffusion coefficients are calculated using the microscopic displacements of particles along the trajectory .",
    "the diffusion coefficients obtained using our numerical simulation are compared with theoretical predictions yielding very good agreement .    referring again to figure",
    ", we can see that both the asymptotic low and high energy limits are fitted well by our theoretical approach .",
    "the high energy theory fails in the intermediate and low energy regime because the particle velocity changes over a shorter period of time , contrary to the high energy assumption .",
    "the extended low energy theory compares well with the numerical data even in the intermediate energy regime when @xmath194 .",
    "however , it fails when @xmath195 as a consequence of the fact that the effective guide field becomes ill - defined .",
    "the nonlinear theory best describes the scattering of the intermediate energy particles in the range @xmath195 .",
    "the two extended theories give equal results at @xmath196 where they each differ from the numerical results by about 30% .    in summary , we have devised theoretical descriptions of charged particles in isotropic turbulence with no mean field that are applicable to distinct ranges of particle energies .",
    "different reasoning enters in the various ranges of rigidity @xmath193 .",
    "properly normalized , the results apply equally well to relativistic and nonrelativistic particle transport , provided that the random magnetic field is isotropic with zero mean .",

    "the slow and the fast variables can be written in terms of a small parameter @xmath197 as : @xmath198 @xmath199    the motivation for different time ordering when compared to the spatial ordering comes from the fact that , if we let @xmath197 be the ratio of scattering length scale to the transport length scale , then from the spatial diffusion equation a simple dimensional analysis shows that the ratio of scattering time scale to the transport time scale should be of the order @xmath200 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "averaged over the fast variables , the @xmath214 term is @xmath215 without loss of generality we may pick the direction of the gradient to be the @xmath100-direction .",
    "the left hand side of equation [ oe2 ] has a projection only onto the @xmath216 term of the spherical harmonics .",
    "the right hand side must also have a projection onto the @xmath216 term . with the help of equations [ spher_harm ] and [ eigen_val ] in equation [ oe2 ] , one finds @xmath217    when averaged over the fast variables the @xmath218 term gives : @xmath219 substituting the relation between @xmath220 and @xmath212 from equation [ oe2_sec ] into equation [ oe3 ] one gets @xmath221 where a repeated index indicates summation . to study the diffusion of the bulk distribution , we consider the average over all directions . from equation [ eigen_val ] , we see that the right hand side of equation [ oe3b ] averages to zero .",
