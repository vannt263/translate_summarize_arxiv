    "there is now a large body of evidence showing that dark molecular clouds in the interstellar medium are clumpy on a scale not resolved by single - dish molecular line observations .",
    "for example , @xcite showed from co line observations that the well - studied tmc-1 core d , previously regarded as a single entity in dynamics and chemistry , consists of some 47 distinct sub - cores .",
    "this notable discovery has beeen shown to have implications for the evolution of tmc-1 and its chemical richness @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the bima interferometer to make a detailed study of structure within the molecular cloud l673 .",
    "their maps in lines of cs , n@xmath0h@xmath1 , and hco@xmath1 showed considerable structure not previously revealed in single - dish studies @xcite .",
    "this structure is different in each molecular line , suggesting that chemical time - dependence is responsible , and that the density inhomogeneities ( hereafter described as cores ) are probably growing from low to high density on a time - scale around one million years and then dissipating on a similar time - scale .",
    "further work by @xcite combined both single - dish and array observations , and the resulting maps which represented emissions from both background and clumped gas confirmed the general picture of @xcite .",
    "this small - scale structure had , in fact , been inferred a decade earlier from observations of ( particularly ) cs and nh@xmath2 lines in a number of objects @xcite ; these studies showed unexpected distributions in the emissions from these molecules .",
    "@xcite proposed that the unexpected behaviour could be understood on the basis of time - dependent chemistry in unresolved structures that grow and decay on time - scales of around a million years .",
    "alternative explanations were also offered ( see section 3.2 ) , but the interpretation of @xcite now appears to be supported by the high - resolution observations of - so far - two molecular clouds .",
    "however , the general picture of clumpiness indicated by @xcite and by @xcite is also supported by discussions of the chemistry associated with interstellar clumpiness @xcite and extending to very small and very transient structures in diffuse interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "* hereafter gwhrv ) modelled the chemistry of a single transient core within a cloud .",
    "they assumed that the clump grows from a low density background gas to high density and then decays into the background according to a prescription based on a study by @xcite of the passage of mhd waves through a partly ionized cloud ( other authors have also found density inhomogeneities may be produced in low - beta plasma conditions , based on turbulence simulations , see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in this model",
    ", the chemistry follows the changing density as a function of position within the core ; ices form on dust in the denser parts of the core and are returned to the gas phase when the density decreases .",
    "the main conclusions of gwhrv were that the dynamical time - dependence and the gas grain interactions greatly affected the chemistry as compared to that in more conventional models based on static objects .    in the present paper",
    "we adopt the picture of molecular clouds established observationally for tmc-1 core d and for l673 ; i.e. we assume that a molecular cloud may be considered as an ensemble of transient cores .",
    "the observations indicate that a range of core masses is present . for simplicity , however , we assume in the present work that all cores have the same mass ; alternative pictures will be investigated in later work .",
    "we use the chemical results of gwhrv for a single core , and create synthetic maps at both low and high resolution of an idealized molecular cloud composed of a large number of such transient cores .",
    "these cores are positioned randomly within our model cloud , and are taken to be at random stages of evolution in the cycle from low to high density and back again .",
    "our aim in creating these maps is to determine whether such a model of a molecular cloud is better able to represent the observed properties of molecular clouds than conventional static and uniform models , and to use these models to throw light on the dynamics , chemistry , and gas - grain interactions occurring in these clouds .",
    "note that we do not attempt here to model a specific cloud in this work .    in section 2",
    "we describe the chemical model of a single core used in this work , the method of map generation and the map parameters adopted . in section 3",
    "we present results in the form of high and low resolution contour maps of emissions from various molecules for our model cloud .",
    "these show remarkable similarity to observational maps . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we consider the stability of our conclusions with respect to changes in map parameters and to the adopted mantle re - injection properties .",
    "our general conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "we assume that the synthetic dark cloud region is made up entirely of cores with the chemical and physical parameters of a single generic standard core , similar to that of the standard run of gwhrv .",
    "the new standard core differs slightly from gwhrv in several ways :    * the number of species is increased by 30 , to 251 .",
    "the new chemical species consist mainly of longer carbon chain molecules ( up to five carbon atoms compared to three ) .",
    "* the level of freeze - out is parametrised in a different way ; rather than setting @xmath3 , the freeze out _ rate _ , to a standard value , it is set such that it will produce a standard percentage of co freeze - out for the central depth point at the time when peak density is achieved .",
    "this level is chosen to be @xmath4 .",
    "we therefore identify @xmath4 co freeze - out with a sticking coefficient of unity .",
    "* we choose a threshold visual extinction for freeze - out to proceed of a@xmath5 .",
    "the original value of 2 was set to ensure that freeze - out would have _ some _ noticeable effect ; since this is quite clearly not a problem , we choose a new value more in keeping with the estimate from @xcite of between 2 and 3 .",
    "this has the effect of limiting freeze - out to depth points 7 - 12 ( cf .",
    "points 6 - 12 in gwhrv ) .",
    "* we choose a peak central visual extinction of exactly 5.0 rather than 5.12 .",
    "this model produces the same general features as gwhrv , with the following differences : the higher level of freeze - out results in slightly higher grain mantle abundances of co , and higher gas phase levels of nh@xmath2 , ch@xmath6 and other less abundant carbon - bearing molecules , at earlier times .",
    "cs shows the same double - peaked structure as before , but shows stronger central depletion . by the end of the run",
    ", any differences have largely disappeared .",
    "previous modelling runs have shown that the chemistry of the core is not strongly sensitive to a change in evolution time - scale of a factor of two shorter or longer , hence our adoption of one core evolution time - scale to represent all cores is acceptable .",
    "an example of the results from the model is shown in figures [ fig1]a & b. the discontinuities in the column density profiles after peak time are a numerical artefact ; the result of the discrete placement of chemical reference points in the core , and follow from the instantaneous re - injection of grain ice mantles into the gas phase ( as discussed in gwhrv ) .",
    "we have remedied this numerical problem by integrating the profiles between the peaks , effectively eliminating the artificial peak structure ( figures [ fig2]a & b ) .",
    "this procedure is not entirely consistent with the chemistry , since with a continuous distribution of reference points throughout the core , we should expect the levels at each point to combine with the others , producing larger overall levels .",
    "however , the rate of re - injection and the range of visual extinctions over which it may take place is not known , since the mechanism itself is not understood .",
    "we therefore consider two extremes : smoothed column density profiles at the peak values should reasonably produce a maximal re - injection peak effect .",
    "conversely , by smoothing over the peaks by integrating between the levels obtained before the peaks occur and after they have relaxed , we may obtain profiles for a minimal level of re - injection .",
    "this approximates the case where re - injection is slow compared to gas phase reactions .",
    "we investigate this case in section 5 .",
    "we make no attempt to model the details of the radiative transfer , and do not consider optical depth effects .",
    "however , we incorporate a very approximate treatment of the excitation : we may simplistically argue that for emission in a molecular line to be detectable , the gas density must be above the critical density for thermalisation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , as explained in @xcite , a more realistic effective critical density ( @xmath7 ) which takes into account such processes as multi - level transitions and the trapping of line photons in optically thick lines , can be defined .",
    "@xcite presents values of @xmath7 ( defined to be the value of the density which yields a line strength of 1k in the relevant transition ) calculated using a large velocity gradient radiative transfer code for some commonly observed molecular transitions , and adopting a kinetic temperature of @xmath8 k ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we adopt these threshold values and employ them in the calculation of column densities using the value of @xmath7 as an integration edge , so that material in the core for which @xmath9 contributes to the emission , whilst material with @xmath10 does not .",
    "this approach is still quite simplistic , but acts to limit contributions from highly extended regions of gas which may not be of sufficient density to emit .",
    "this will mostly affect cs morphologies in the synthetic maps , since the cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) line , used in @xcite , has a high value of @xmath7 .",
    "cs is abundant in relatively low density cores at early / late times ; the effect should heavily subdue contributions from these cores in the cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) line , and should cut down the calculated levels even in cores at peak densities .    the critical densities and other information for relevant transitions are shown in table [ tab6 - 1 ] @xcite .",
    "note that data for n@xmath0h@xmath1 were not available .",
    "for co , we assume that a gas density of @xmath12 @xmath13 is sufficient to produce a detection @xcite , since the small dipole moment of the co molecule produces lines that are usually very well thermalised .    figure [ fig2]a shows the unsmoothed column density profiles obtained using the effective critical densities of table [ tab6 - 1 ] . figure [ fig2]b shows the smoothed profiles .",
    "note that cs and nh@xmath2 are by far the most strongly affected by re - injection .",
    "the cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) transition may be seen to trace the cores at closer to the peak density than the cs ( j=1@xmath110 ) transition , although the column densities produced are a little lower .",
    "the figures show clearly at what stage in a core s evolution the densities are too low to produce detectable emission in the cs transitions .      having established a chemical model for an individual core",
    ", we subsequently assume that each core has identical chemical and physical / dynamical parameters .",
    "the only free parameters are the location and evolutionary status of the cores . to each core",
    "we therefore assign column densities calculated for all the molecules modelled in the standard run , which vary depending on the designated stage of evolution of each core . to construct a map of the ensemble of cores we adopt the following approach :    * designate a map size , and the number of cores within it * assign each core a randomly determined position * assign each core a randomly determined stage of evolution    note",
    "that there is no empirical constraint , or model significance , concerning the location of the cores in the third dimension .",
    "this results in a purely random ensemble of cores , with no inherent bias towards any particular structure other than that the region is composed of discrete cores of gas , and that a uniform core number density has been adopted for the whole region .",
    "this is consistent with the apparent lack of any particular bias in the l673 region .",
    "there will , however , be an effect on the resultant local morphologies displayed within the maps from groupings resulting from the random distribution of the cores .",
    "this will result in unique morphologies for any given distribution of cores .",
    "we also make the important assumption that the cores are chemically and physically non - interacting .",
    "this is also consistent with the observations of individual cores and the findings of the theoretical models . in any case , those cores which are localised in the plane of the map may not in fact be close neighbours in three dimensions .",
    "we then convolve the integrated column densities of each core into a set of molecular line maps for various tracers :    * _ divide map into a grid of `` detection points '' . _",
    "+ the resolution of the grid of reference points must be smaller than the beam resolution so that the entire map is well covered by the simulated beam .",
    "* _ designate a beam resolution / beam width . _",
    "+ a beam resolution is chosen which simulates a real telescope .",
    "a simple gaussian diffraction profile is assumed for the beam . * _ for each detection point , calculate contribution of `` detected column density '' from each core which lies within the detection radius .",
    "_ + in this way , simulated detection levels are attributed to each detection point in the map from which contour maps can be generated .    to characterize the size of the cores ,",
    "we adopt a gaussian profile , and define a scale width as the intrinsic radius . since the models of @xcite are only one - dimensional , we can not say with any certainty how the density profiles along other axes may vary . however , the adoption of a gaussian profile is in line with the density profile approximations along the axis of core collapse .",
    "we make one further constraint on the intrinsic radius of the core : that it obeys the conservation of mass requirement ( gwhrv ) .",
    "the @xcite mechanism does not necessarily require the cores to conserve their mass , however this stipulation is in line with our assertion that the cores are individual , non - interacting entities . because all of the column density calculations obtained from the chemical model are made along the principal collapse axis , for the sake of consistency we assume that each core is aligned with its principal collapse axis along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , we allow the observed radius of each core to vary only in a way consistent with this alignment , that is : @xmath14^{1/4}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the core scale width along the principal axis as defined in gwhrv ( see appendix for derivation ) and is calculated in the chemical model .",
    "@xmath16 obviously reaches a minimum at the time of the peak density of the core , @xmath17 .",
    "we fix @xmath18 so that it assumes a value of some ( substantial ) fraction of @xmath19 , determined according to comparisons with @xcite .",
    "having attributed each core with an intrinsic width dependent on its stage of evolution , the map of the cores of finite dimensions is convolved with the ( off - axis ) gaussian beam to produce the synthesized maps .",
    "note that the column densities only account for the centre of the core , along the line of sight , so the `` detected '' morphologies should be thought of as being representative of the extents of the _ core centers _ rather than the entire core plus envelope .",
    "the uniform alignment of the cores collapse axes along the line of sight is a necessary simplification , given the 1-dimensional nature of reliable mhd simulations ( see gwhrv ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on which to base our dynamical model .",
    "the main effect of this assumption is to make every core circular in the plane of `` observation '' ; we might expect that a full 3-dimensional chemical / dynamical model would produce non - circular morphologies for individual cores , if even higher resolutions than we use here were adopted .",
    "it should not have a drastic effect on the convolved morpholgies shown in this work .",
    "we would also expect that the relative extents in the plane for molecules in individual cores could be somewhat different ( e.g. cs versus nh@xmath2 ; see the collapse - axis molecular extents shown in gwhrv ) .",
    "however , this effect should not be large since contributions are strongest from the core centers .",
    "it could be remedied by choosing core widths according to the molecule being mapped , however for consistency we use the same widths for all molecules .",
    "there are approximately 40 spatially separable cores observed in the cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) line in the @xmath20(0.5 pc)@xmath21 maps of @xcite .",
    "the cores observed in the hco@xmath1 ( j=1@xmath110 ) and n@xmath0h@xmath1 ( j=1@xmath110 ) lines do not generally coincide with those of cs or with each other ; this is as expected ( gwhrv ) and is primarily a result of chemical differentiation within the cores .",
    "also , some closely separated cores will be unresolved whilst others will have observationally undetectable column densities .",
    "we therefore estimate a value of @xmath2060 cores , leading to a core number density of 250 pc@xmath22 .",
    "we use a global map size of 2 pc@xmath232 pc ( approximately equal to the size of the cs maps of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) within which there are a total of 1000 cores .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the basic map of core positions , the synthetic `` sky '' .",
    "we denote the approximate stage of evolution : plusses ( + ) indicate cores that have not yet reached peak time , and are therefore not yet at maximal density ; crosses ( @xmath23 ) indicate cores which have evolved past the peak time .",
    "the relative sizes of the symbols also indicate approximately how far into the cycle the cores are : larger symbols indicate larger densities ( or proximity to peak time ) .    we take two subsets of the data in these maps which simulate the observational data :    *",
    "_ large - scale , low resolution maps_. + these maps essentially cover the whole 2pc@xmath232pc area , although we ignore `` emission '' from within 0.1 pc of the edges .",
    "this is because levels at the edges are influenced by the lack of any cores outside of the map , producing an unnatural drop in `` detection '' . to avoid this artefact",
    ", we remove a strip around the edge of the maps of size approximately equal to the beam radius .",
    "the resolution corresponds to a beam width of just under 2 arcmin to agree approximately with @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a beam radius of 0.085 pc , calculated at a distance to l673 of 300 pc . *",
    "_ small - scale , high resolution maps_. + here we zoom in on a region of the low resolution maps of size @xmath20 0.6 pc @xmath23 0.6 pc chosen so as to accommodate both local cs and nh@xmath2 peaks .",
    "this is comparable to the area ( @xmath200.5 pc @xmath23 0.5 pc ) studied by @xcite .",
    "this was chosen from within the detection map of @xcite to coincide with peaks in cs emission , and in nh@xmath2 detected by @xcite .",
    "+ the synthesised beams employed in @xcite using bima are @xmath24 arcsec , corresponding to a circular beam radius used here of @xmath200.0125 pc .    note that a single beam width is adopted for all species / transitions .",
    "figures [ fig4]a  f show low resolution ( @xmath202 fwhm ) _ column density _ convolved molecular line maps for six density tracers .",
    "we overlay the basic map of core positions ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) for ease of comparison .",
    "the contours represent fractions of the peak value calculated for the map , for any particular molecule .",
    "the fractions of peak `` emission '' represented by the contours are chosen to correspond with those of the low resolution observations shown in @xcite .",
    "the outermost ( thick ) contour line represents the half - maximum ( 0.5 ) , with the levels rising by @xmath200.05 .",
    "the overlaid boxes represent the portion of the map on which we zoom - in in the high resolution maps .    as is generally observed in dark clouds ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the morphologies of the different molecular tracers are not the same , do not trace the same regions , and have different spatial extents .",
    "indeed we see here that the characteristic features exhibited in molecular line maps of co , cs and nh@xmath2 in @xcite are broadly re - produced .",
    "we find that co and cs are not significantly different in spatial extent .",
    "the `` detection '' of nh@xmath2 is comparatively compact and agrees well with the evidence of @xcite .",
    "hco@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 both seem to track approximately the same regions of gas , with very similar morphologies and extents .",
    "these molecules display smaller extents than co or cs and their contour map peaks correspond to peaks in h@xmath0 and co. this is consistent with the observation that n@xmath0h@xmath1 tends to be a good density tracer .",
    "+      for the zoomed - in high resolution synthetic molecular line maps , we choose a region from the bottom - left section of the map of approximately the same size as the region of l673 examined in @xcite , chosen for the presence of cs and nh@xmath2 peaks in that area .",
    "figures [ fig5]a  f show maps for co , cs , hco@xmath1 , nh@xmath2 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "contour levels are set to correspond to those used in @xcite : the lowest is 0.36 of maximum , the others increasing by 0.07 .    in comparison with @xcite ,",
    "the cs morphologies are generally similar , although we do not see so many resolved cores in the synthetic map ; the same is true for hco@xmath1 .",
    "although the overall morphology for n@xmath0h@xmath1 is very similar to that of hco@xmath1 , the number of resolved n@xmath0h@xmath1 cores matches well with @xcite .",
    "both the larger- and smaller - sized cores are reproduced in the synthetic maps .",
    "note that the `` emission '' is not purely centred around individual cores but around small groupings .",
    "clumps of emission out on their own which reach only two or three contour levels ( 0.43  0.50 of maximum ) tend to be the result of individual cores or loose associations of two or three .",
    "the good agreement of comparative cs and nh@xmath2 peak positions and extents in the low resolution maps with the observational evidence of @xcite is encouraging : the general morphologies of these molecules match those of dark cloud cores examined in @xcite .",
    "those authors calculated mean fwhm extents in 16 dark cloud cores to be 0.15 pc ( nh@xmath2 ) , 0.27 pc ( cs ) and 0.36 pc ( c@xmath25o ) .",
    "the extents of cs and nh@xmath2 are arguably larger than this , but appear to preserve the correct relative extents .",
    "this is particularly important in that the spatial extents of the cs and nh@xmath2 emissions are the opposite of what one would expect from simple critical density arguments _ for a single core _",
    "( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "previous attempts to resolve this problem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have invoked differential depletion effects between sulphur - bearing and nitrogen - bearing species ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the chemical basis for such models has not been confirmed .",
    "@xcite first suggested that the cs / nh@xmath2 discrepancy could be a result of the clumpy nature of molecular clouds .",
    "their chemical models used the modified free - fall collapse mechanism of @xcite , and did not include subsequent dispersal .",
    "they conjectured that most clumps would disperse before significant nh@xmath2 levels could build up , whilst cs should peak before this time arrived .",
    "the adoption of the mechanism proposed by @xcite , here , allows for the ( controlled ) dispersal of a core .",
    "however it is for similar reasons as those suggested by @xcite that the differences in the morphologies of cs & nh@xmath2 is reproduced in our models ; the nh@xmath2 peaks later than cs , and for a less extended period of time .",
    "the good morphological agreement of the high resolution maps , especially for n@xmath0h@xmath1 , with those of @xcite indicates that the @xcite mechanism produces data consistent with observations of small , transient , dense cores .",
    "whilst the simulated low resolution maps should not be expected to correspond closely with the particular example of region l673 , we note that , as in l673 , the emission from cs and hco@xmath1/n@xmath0h@xmath1 do not generally represent the same cores , regions of stronger emission overlap , and similar ratios of strongly and weakly emitting cores are present .    in table",
    "[ tab6 - 2 ] we present column densities ( and ratios ) as determined by the model , for the low resolution and high resolution maps , and compare with levels detected in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "taking a similar approach to the latter work , we select the peak position for each transition in the high resolution maps and compare values at the same spatial positions .",
    "these points are represented by _ diamond_-shaped markers in figures [ fig5]b  e",
    ". we also give column density values calculated from the low resolution data , at the low resolution molecular line maxima within the high resolution map domain .",
    "these are represented by _ square_-shaped markers . following @xcite ,",
    "for each low resolution peak we present the column density only of the molecule whose peak it is .",
    "peak a corresponds to the shared high resolution peak in co and cs ( j=1@xmath110 ) .",
    "peaks b , c , and d correspond to the high resolution peaks in cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) , hco@xmath1 ( j=1@xmath110 ) and nh@xmath2 ( 1,1 ) , respectively .    in table",
    "[ tab6 - 3 ] we present the equivalent column density data obtained from the low resolution observations of @xcite ( their table 4 ) and the high resolution observations of @xcite ( their table 3 ) .",
    "peaks e and w correspond to cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) peaks , whilst peak n corresponds to hco@xmath1 ( j=1@xmath110 ) and peak s to n@xmath0h@xmath1 ( j=1@xmath110 ) .    considering the low resolution peaks in table [ tab6 - 2 ] ;",
    "the cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) maximum ( b ) is close in value to the cs ( j=1@xmath110 ) peak level ( a ) - and the two peaks are located very close together . the low resolution hco@xmath1 value is more than an order of magnitude lower than the peak in either of the cs transitions .",
    "nh@xmath2 is a factor of 2  3 lower than the cs peak levels .",
    "the distance between the nh@xmath2 and cs ( j=1@xmath110 ) low resolution peaks is 0.31 pc , which agrees reasonably well with the @xmath26 pc quoted for the specific case of l673 in @xcite .",
    "however , the actual levels and ratios detected do not agree well with that paper . whilst the synthesised nh@xmath2 peak level may be as low as half the observed value , the synthesised cs ( j=1@xmath110 ) peak level is about an order of magnitude too high .",
    "this leaves a ratio of [ cs / nh@xmath2]=3.0 , rather than the quoted value of @xmath28 .    for the high resolution synthetic values , at the cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) peak ( b ) ,",
    "the hco@xmath1 ( j=1@xmath110 ) column density is little changed from its peak value ( c ) . however , the cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) column density at peak c is a factor of three lower than at b. this difference is due to peak b being an unresolved combination of three strongly emitting cores  one slightly post - peak density , another slightly pre - peak density , and the other a little younger again .",
    "this combination acts to give high values for each of the molecules except nh@xmath2 ( which is so strongly weighted towards later times in the column density profile of figure [ fig2 ] ) . the close proximity of the three cores , which are approximately 1 high resolution fwhm beamwidth apart , allows them to reinforce each other effectively .    the high resolution synthesised cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) and hco@xmath1 ( j=1@xmath110 ) column densities are even larger again than the observed values ",
    "peak cs levels are as much as two orders of magnitude larger than observed , and hco@xmath1 levels more than one order of magnitude larger .",
    "it can be seen that , contrary to the observations , the synthesised column densities are higher at the high resolution peaks than for the low resolution peaks .",
    "this is possibly an effect of the presence of many , unresolved , low - level cores in l673 , or else the interferometric observations may have resolved out the more extended features .",
    "the overall column density levels obtained are generally too high , even at low resolution .",
    "four factors may explain this : ( i ) the level of uniformity of core distribution may have an effect such that the peaks observed in the synthetic maps represent close associations of cores ( as mentioned above ) , in particular those close associations of cores at similar stages of evolution , ( ii ) the chemical ( and/or physical ) evolution of individual cores may vary from that adopted here , ( iii ) this approach uses only one core chemistry to model the entire region .",
    "in reality , we might expect to see a spectrum of cores within the same cloud .",
    "chemical model runs adopting different parameters from those of the standard core run have shown that the resultant chemistry ( and the cs & nh@xmath2 abundances ) can vary strongly with visual extinction , ( iv ) smaller core widths ( in the plane ) should produce smaller column densities .",
    "the @xcite hco@xmath1 emission is less extended and more defined than the cs in particular , and this may be due to only smaller regions near the core centre being able to produce it .",
    "evidently , the model cloud is chemically richer than l673 .",
    "no attempt has been made here to model l673 , other than in general morphology .",
    "it may be , for example , that the cosmic ray ionization rate is less for l673 than adopted in the model .",
    "as suggested above , the precise morphological distributions depend on the assumed ( random ) distribution of the cores . in this section",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of the results to this distribution .",
    "we restrict the analysis to the high resolution maps so that the assumed distribution is locally valid .",
    "we define two statistical measures of the uniformity of the distribution of the cores : the mean shortest inter - cores distance ( icd , analogous to core number density ) and the standard error in this mean ( sem , uniformity of distribution ) . in the locality of a single core , the icd is very important for the relative influences of either core on the convolved map , especially when close to the beam resolution limit .",
    "higher values of the sem imply greater deviations from uniformity .",
    "we start by generating a quasi - random map with a very uniform distribution , and then stochastically move the positions of the cores by small amounts to vary the two statistical parameters .",
    "this results in maps whose only difference is in the location of cores , rather than their evolutionary status .",
    "three cores distributions have been considered ; ( 1 ) : icd=0.524 pc , sem=4.21% , ( 2 ) icd=0.520 pc , sem=4.85% , and ( 3 ) icd=0.529 pc , sem=5.19% . the convolved molecular line maps for distribution ( 1 ) are shown in figure [ fig6 ] .    even with the much greater level of uniformity in distribution 1",
    ", we do not resolve many cores individually .",
    "we may discern , however , that for co those peaks whose contours are very tight tend to be the result of core associations , whereas peaks whose contours are broad and fairly regular tend to be single cores , close to their peak densities .",
    "these peaks do not tend to be as strong as those for which core associations are responsible .",
    "for the other molecules , most peaks tend to be the result of the resolution of single , fairly isolated cores .",
    "in general we find that the apparent degree of confusion in the maps is smaller and the peak levels and contrasts are larger for the more random ( less uniform ) distributions .",
    "the spacing between emitting cores is the dominant factor in determining the morphologies of the maps .    using the different molecular tracers as test cases for these variables , we see that as in the case of the cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) maps , widely spaced emitting cores produce quite tight peaks , and more strong peaks tend to be present with decreasing uniformity of general core distribution .    table [ tab6 - 5 ] shows column densities at the peak positions ( for the strongest peak in the map ) for each molecule .",
    "it might seem that there is a slight trend for levels to be higher for lower uniformity of core distributions , but this is only consistently true for co. however , this does suggest firstly that the levels obtained from observations are quite robust with respect to the pattern of core distribution , and secondly that the discrepancy between the observed and modelled cs / nh@xmath2 column densities is not likely to be resolved by consideration of such effects .",
    "the observed cs j=2@xmath111 morphologies @xcite most closely resemble the modelled morphologies of co , particularly for the most uniform distribution , suggesting that cs cores are not highly clustered in l673 , and that the contributing cores in that region are probably more numerous than is assumed in this model .",
    "the most probable explanation for this is that there are a number of inherently more weakly emitting cores in l673 , which have different physical conditions from those that we have modelled . from the similarity between the modelled co and the observed cs",
    ", we may infer that the e and w peaks in the cs ( j=2@xmath111 ) emission of @xcite are more likely to be the result of core associations , whilst the emission at peak n may come from two underlying cores .",
    "finally , we consider the effects of using column density profiles with a minimal contribution from the re - injection of dust grain mantles .",
    "this follows from the situation where the rate of deposition of grain mantle - bound species is so slow compared to the rate of destruction of injected species by the gas phase chemistry that there is no discernible difference in the resultant column density measured through the core .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the resultant column density profiles and can be compared to the ` maximal ' re - injection case ( fig . [ fig2]b ) .",
    "we apply these profiles to the same basic `` sky '' map .    of the various tracers ,",
    "the most strongly affected is the nh@xmath2 morphology , shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "it not only assumes a smaller spatial extent but maps different material from the maximal re - injection case - tracing regions that are very similar to those traced by hco@xmath1 ( j=1@xmath110 ) .",
    "the relative morphologies of cs ( j=1@xmath110 ) , co and nh@xmath2 ( 1,1 ) are perhaps closer to those observed by @xcite than in the maximal re - injection case .    however , the absolute nh@xmath2 peak levels are less consistent with measured values . since the absolute nh@xmath2 column densities are a more robust measure , it is more likely that the morphologies exhibited in @xcite etc .",
    "are the product of a range of chemistries engendered by a spectrum of cores in dark clouds , as already discussed , rather than being explained purely by the adoption of the minimal re - injection profile .",
    "high resolution maps show that the differences are slight compared to the maximal re - injection case for all species except nh@xmath2 , which maps very similar regions to hco@xmath1 ( j=1@xmath110 ) as at low resolution .",
    "therefore , a test of this extreme of re - injection would be whether or not hco@xmath1 and nh@xmath2 appear to map the same regions .",
    "we have constructed a molecular line contour map of a model dark cloud by placing a large number of evolving cores randomly in space and attributing to each a randomly determined stage of evolution .",
    "the column density data from the chemical model of such an evolving core have been applied to each core in the map , and all such data convolved to simulate molecular line maps of dark cloud regions .",
    "observational evidence of l673 from morata et al .",
    "( 1997 and 2003 ) has been used to guide the choice of map parameters .",
    "the computed low resolution morphologies of nh@xmath2 and cs are found to agree well with the observational evidence of the spatial extent of these molecules and with the relative positions of peaks and contours in l673 .",
    "co assumes a slightly smaller extent than is evidenced by the survey of @xcite of 16 dark cloud cores .",
    "the computed high resolution maps confirm that the model produces morphologies and peak positions similar to those in l673 .",
    "the comparison of the synthetic maps with observational data suggests that the cores in l673 are randomly situated and have no particular bias in space .",
    "we show in sections 4 and 5 that the general behaviour of the model is fairly stable against variations in the spatial distribution of cores and the method of injection of ices into the gas phase during the expansion of the core .",
    "the absence of proper radiative transfer in the code was a necessary compromise in our calculations , but the use of effective critical emission densities allowed the discrimination of different molecular line transitions in the simulations : the convolution of data obtained from chemical modelling to produce maps similar to observations is striking , and probably unique in the history of chemical modelling of molecular clouds .",
    "the level of agreement between observations and models of absolute values of molecular column densities is good and indicates that our proposal to model dark clouds as an ensemble of identical transient cores is not merely plausible but may actually represent the true situation .",
    "in summary , our main conclusions from this study are as follows :    1 .   a molecular cloud model considered as a large ensemble of randomly placed evolving cores , each with randomly allocated states of evolution , generates molecular line maps at low and high resolution that are remarkably similar in character to those observed in l673 ; the observed structures can not be generated by simple models of unitary homogeneous or collapsing clouds .",
    "2 .   the molecular line maps broadly reproduce morphologies , sizes of emitting regions , and separation in peak positions in various species , as found in l673 .",
    "in such a model , the chemistry in each core responds to the changing physical state of the gas as it contracts from low density to a transient high density state and then back to low density .",
    "for the model to generate molecular line maps similar to those observed , the time - scale for the dynamical cycle is required to be on the order of a million years .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the theoretical mhd study of falle and hartquist ( 2002 ) .",
    "the gas - dust interactions significantly affect the chemistry of each core and of the cloud .",
    "for the model to match observations , the freeze - out of gas - phase species that occurs in the denser part of the cycle must remove a significant amount of matter ( other than hydrogen and helium ) from the gas ( on the order of one half ) in the form of ice mantles .",
    "the ice mantles must be returned to the gas as the core expands to a low density state .",
    "the excellent morphological match of models with observational maps of l673 supports the view that the cores in that cloud are randomly spaced and randomly evolving , rather than being structured either spatially or temporally .",
    "the contrast between cs and nh@xmath2 distributions in l673 ( and many other dark clouds ; morata et al .",
    "1997 ) is well accounted for in the model .",
    "this justifies the assertion of @xcite concerning unresolved cores .",
    "however , the extent of the model nh@xmath2 emitting region is to some extent an artefact of the method of computing the injection of ices into the gas .",
    "our models clearly indicate that hco@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 emissions should be co - located in the maps , contrary to the findings of @xcite .",
    "however , their conclusion is that this may be an observational artefact : @xcite have shown that the apparent separation of hco@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 emissions may be caused by high optical depths in the hco@xmath1 lines .",
    "observations of co - located emission peaks in cs and hco@xmath1 are predicted by the model to arise from superpositions of cores at different stages of evolution .    finally , we emphasise that in the present models all the cores are assumed to have equal mass .",
    "it is clear , however , from the observations of @xcite that a range of core masses is present in l673 .",
    "as larger cores evolve , they may become unstable to gravitational collapse . in future work",
    ", we shall consider the chemical implications of core size and the possible relation to low mass star formation .",
