    "the fast development of spintronics aims at making devices based on the electron spin .",
    "semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) are one of the promising candidates for the implementation of quantum computations@xcite because of the relative long spin coherence time , which has been proved both theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite among different kinds of qds , double quantum dot ( dqd ) system attracted much more attention recently as there is an additional coupling between two qds in both vertical@xcite and parallel@xcite dqds , which can be controlled conveniently by a small gate voltage .",
    "therefore spin devices based on dqds can be designed with more flexibility .",
    "so far many elements of the spintronic device , such as quantum logical gates,@xcite spin filters@xcite and spin pumps@xcite were proposed and/or demonstrated based on dqd system . specially , in our previous work , a way to control spin relaxation time ( @xmath1 ) induced by the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) together with the electron  bulk - phonon ( bp ) scattering in dqds by a small gate voltage was proposed.@xcite however , according to our latest study,@xcite the spin relaxation can be controlled by other mechanisms also , if calculated correctly . in the present paper , we include all the spin decoherence mechanisms following our latest study in the single qd system , and apply the equation - of - motion approach to study the spin decoherence in dqd system . by this approach , not only the spin relaxation time but also the spin dephasing time ( @xmath2 ) can be obtained .",
    "we show that both the spin relaxation and the spin dephasing can be manipulated by a small gate voltage in dqd system . especially , the large variation of spin relaxation still exists even at @xmath0  k. the dqd system studied here can be realized easily using the present available technology .",
    "we organize the paper as following . in sec .",
    "ii we set up the model and briefly introduce different spin decoherence mechanisms .",
    "the equation - of - motion approach is also explained simply . then in sec .",
    "iii we present our numerical results .",
    "we first show how the eigen energies and eigen wave functions vary with the bias field in sec .",
    "then the electric field dependences of spin relaxation and spin dephasing are shown in sec .",
    "iiib and iiic , respectively .",
    "we conclude in sec .  iv .",
    "we consider a single electron spin in two vertically coupled qds with a bias voltage @xmath3 and an external magnetic field @xmath4 applied along the growth direction ( @xmath5-axis ) .",
    "each qd is confined by a parabolic potential @xmath6 ( therefore the effective dot diameter @xmath7 ) in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane in a quantum well of width @xmath10 .",
    "the confining potential @xmath11 along the @xmath5-direction reads @xmath12 in which @xmath13 represents the barrier height between the two dots , @xmath14 stands for the inter - dot distance and @xmath15 denotes the electric field due to the bias voltage @xmath3",
    ". then the electron hamiltonian reads @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electron effective mass and @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the vector potential .",
    "@xmath20 is the zeeman energy with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the @xmath21-factor of electron , bohr magneton and pauli matrix respectively .",
    "@xmath24 is the hamiltonian of the soc . in gaas ,",
    "when the quantum well width and the gate voltage along the growth direction are small , the rashba soc@xcite is unimportant.@xcite therefore , only the dresselhaus term@xcite contributes to @xmath25 . when the quantum well width is smaller than the qd diameter , the dominant term in the dresselhaus soc reads @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 denotes the dresselhaus coefficient , @xmath29 is the quantum number of @xmath5-direction and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the eigen wave function of the electron along the @xmath5-direction.@xcite the electron eigen energy and wave function in the @xmath8-@xmath9plane can be obtained by the exact diagonalization approach.@xcite    the interactions between the electron and the lattice lead to the electron spin decoherence .",
    "these interactions contain two parts , one is the hyperfine interaction between the electron and the nuclei , the other is the electron - phonon interaction which is further composed of the electron - bp interaction @xmath33 , the direct spin - phonon coupling due to the phonon induced strain @xmath34 and the phonon - induced @xmath21-factor fluctuation .",
    "we briefly summarize these spin decoherence mechanisms and the detailed expressions can be found in ref .",
    ": ( i ) the soc together with the electron - bp scattering @xmath33 .",
    "as the soc mixes different spins , the electron - bp can induce spin relaxation and spin dephasing .",
    "( ii ) direct spin - phonon coupling due to the phonon - induced stain @xmath34.@xcite because this mechanism mixes different spins and also is related to the electron - phonon interaction , it can induce spin decoherence _ alone_. ( iii ) the hyperfine interaction @xmath35.@xcite it is noted that the hyperfine interaction alone only induces @xmath2 since it only changes the electron spin , but not the electron energy .",
    "( iv ) the second - order process of hyperfine interaction combined with the electron - bp interaction @xmath36\\langle \\ell_{1}|$ ] , where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 are the eigen state and eigen energy of @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "although the hyperfine interaction can not induce @xmath41 alone , it is noted that the second - order process , combined with the electron - bp interaction , can induce both @xmath41 and @xmath2 .",
    "the other mechanisms , including the first - order process of hyperfine interaction combined with the electron - bp scattering@xcite and the @xmath21-factor fluctuation@xcite have been proved to be negligible.@xcite    due to the soc , all the states are impure spin states with different expectation values of the spin .",
    "for finite temperature , the electron is distributed over many states and therefore one has to average over all the involved processes to obtain the total spin relaxation time . the fermi - golden - rule approach calculates the spin relaxation from the initial state to the final one whose majority spin polarizations are opposite .",
    "however , the average method is inadequate when many impure states are included.@xcite also the fermi - golden - rule approach can not be used to calculate the spin dephasing time .",
    "therefore , in this paper we adopt the equation - of - motion approach for many - level system with born approximation developed in ref .  . when the spin dephasing induced by the hyperfine interaction is considered , as the slow relaxation of nuclear bath compared to the electron , the kinetics is non - markovian",
    "moreover , because of the born approximation , this equation - of - motion approach can only be applied for strong magnetic field ( @xmath42t).@xcite therefore , the pair - correlation method@xcite is further adopted to calculate the hyperfine interaction induced @xmath2 for small magnetic field .",
    "what should be emphasized is that the soc is always included , no matter which mechanism is considered .",
    "it has been shown that its effect to spin decoherence can not be neglected.@xcite    -axis @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and the energy difference @xmath45 _ vs. _ the bias field @xmath46 .",
    "note the scale of @xmath47 is on the right side of the figure .",
    "( b ) square of the absolute value of the ground state wave function along the @xmath5-axis at two typical bias fields . in the calculation , the well width @xmath48  nm , the inter - dot distance @xmath49  nm and the barrier height @xmath50  ev . , width=283,height=302 ]",
    "following the method addressed above , we perform the numerical calculation in a typical vertically coupled gaas dqd with barrier height @xmath50  ev , inter - dot distance @xmath49  nm and well width @xmath48  nm . the gaas material parameters and the parameters related to different mechanisms are the same with those in ref ..      the eigen energy and eigen wave function along the @xmath5-direction are obtained numerically . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the lowest two eigen energies @xmath51 and @xmath52 along the @xmath5-axis and their difference @xmath53 are plotted as functions of the electric field @xmath46 .",
    "it can be seen that the energy difference @xmath47 increases quickly with the electric field @xmath46 when @xmath46 is larger than @xmath54  kv / cm .",
    "the eigen wave function of the ground state along the @xmath5-axis also has large variation with @xmath46 .",
    "it can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) that when @xmath46 is very small ( @xmath55  kv / cm ) , the wave function of the ground state locates at the two wells almost equally .",
    "however , when @xmath46 is large enough ( @xmath56  kv / cm ) , the wave function of the ground state locates mostly at the quantum well with lower potential .",
    "the physics of such bias - voltage - induced quick change of eigen energy and eigen wave function can be understood as what follows . because of the large barrier height @xmath13 and/or large inter - dot distance @xmath14 , the two quantum dots are nearly independent and the eigen wave function along the @xmath5-axis of the lowest subband spreads equally over the two qds when the source - drain voltage is very small .",
    "therefore at this time the energy difference between the lowest two energy levels along the @xmath5-axis @xmath47 is very small .",
    "however , with the increase of the source - drain voltage , electron can tunnel through the barrier and the wave function is almost located at one dot with lower potential and therefore @xmath47 increases quickly with @xmath46",

    "what is interesting is that when @xmath46 is increased to around @xmath66  kv / cm , the spin relaxations are suppressed very quickly over a small window of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the total spin relaxation can be controlled effectively with a small value of the variation of the bias field @xmath67 .",
    "for example , in fig.[fig2](a ) , the spin relaxation shows ten orders of magnitude variation when the electric field @xmath46 changes from @xmath54 to @xmath68  kv / cm .",
    "this can be understood as following .",
    "all the three mechanisms are related to the electron - bp scattering which is affected sensitively by the phonon wave length .",
    "the scattering becomes most efficient when the phonon wave length is comparable with the dot size .",
    "it is also known that the spin relaxations between the first and second subband are dominant for small electric field.@xcite therefore when @xmath64  kv / cm , as the energy difference between the lowest two subband along the @xmath5-direction @xmath47 is almost constant ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) ) , the spin relaxation keeps nearly unchanged .",
    "when the phonon wave length is comparable with the dot size , the electron - phonon scattering becomes most efficient .",
    "therefore the spin relaxations show maximums .",
    "however , with the further increase of energy difference @xmath47 by the bias voltage , the phonon wave length becomes larger than the dot size .",
    "consequently the spin relaxation decreases very quickly over a small window of @xmath67 .",
    "now we focus on the variation magnitude of the spin relaxation with the bias field under different conditions .",
    "the largest variation of @xmath41 ( @xmath68 orders of magnitude ) happens at small magnetic field @xmath69  t and small diameter @xmath70  nm .",
    "however , for larger @xmath63 ( @xmath71  nm in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) or larger @xmath62 ( @xmath72  t in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) ) , the variations of the total spin relaxation decrease by several orders of magnitude .",
    "it is further seen that when both @xmath63 and @xmath62 are increased [ @xmath73  nm and @xmath74  t in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ] , the variations of the total spin relaxation is even smaller .",
    "this is because the spin relaxation induced by the electron - bp interaction and @xmath61 decreases with @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the high electric field region , where electron is mostly confined in one dot .",
    "this is similar to the single qd case.@xcite therefore to achieve large control of spin decoherence , the magnetic field @xmath62 and dot diameter @xmath63 should be small",

    "it is interesting to see that the spin relaxation induced by the second - order process of hyperfine interaction combined with the electron - bp scattering ( @xmath61 ) still has large variation with @xmath46 ( @xmath76 orders of magnitude variation when @xmath46 changes from @xmath54 to @xmath68  kv / cm ) .",
    "however , the spin relaxations induced by the other two mechanisms keep almost unchanged . this is",
    "because when @xmath75  k , the electron only locates at the lowest orbital level and the spin relaxation happens only between the lowest two zeeman sublevels which keeps unchanged with @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the large variations of spin relaxations induced by the soc together with the electron - bp scattering and the strain - induced direct spin - phonon coupling no longer exist .",
    "however , for @xmath61 , which is the second - order process scattering , the middle states @xmath77 can be higher levels as the hyperfine interaction can couple the spin - opposite states in different subband along the @xmath5-axis .",

    "it is seen that the spin dephasing induced by the soc together with the electron - bp scattering , direct spin - phonon coupling due to the phonon - induced strain and the second - order process of electron - bp scattering combined with the hyperfine interaction always has several orders of magnitude variation with @xmath46 at different @xmath63 and @xmath62 .",
    "however , the spin dephasing induced by the hyperfine interaction only increases a little with @xmath46 , which suppresses the large variation of the spin dephasing induced by the other three mechanisms .",
    "nevertheless , there is still two orders of magnitude variation of the spin dephasing when @xmath62 and @xmath63 are small ( fig  [ fig4](a ) ) .",
    "the large variation of spin dephasing induced by the three mechanisms related to electron - phonon scattering comes from the fast increase of the energy difference @xmath47 , similar to the analysis of spin relaxation .",
    "the spin dephasing induced by the hyperfine interaction is not so sensitive with @xmath46 .",
    "this is because for the hyperfine interaction , @xmath80 , which is obtained from the pair - correlation approach , with @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 being the zeeman splitting energy , the hyperfine interaction parameter and the nuclear number in the quantum dot respectively.@xcite with the increase of the electric field @xmath46 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 keep unchanged and the wave function of the ground state is gradually localized on one dot with lower potential .",
    "this means the effective quantum dot size decreases and consequently @xmath83 decreases .",
    "however , as the effective quantum dot size decreases from two dots into one dot with the bias field @xmath46 , @xmath83 for large @xmath46 is only about a half of that for small @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , @xmath78 for large field is about two times of that for small field due to the decrease of @xmath83 .",
    "however , this increase of @xmath78 induced by the hyperfine interaction is very small compared to that induced by other three mechanisms ( which have several orders of magnitude variation ) .",
    "what should be pointed out is that the variation of spin dephasing does not exist at @xmath75  k. this is because the hyperfine interaction is dominant for the spin dephasing at @xmath75  k , which keeps unchanged with @xmath46 .",
    "in conclusion , we propose a scheme to manipulate the spin decoherence ( both @xmath1 and @xmath84 ) in dqd system by a small gate voltage .",
    "up to ten orders of magnitude of spin relaxation and up to two orders of magnitude of spin dephasing can be obtained . to obtain large variation of spin decoherence , the inter - dot distance and/or the barrier hight",
    "should be large enough in order to guarantee that the two qds are nearly independent for the small bias voltage . at the same time , the effective diameter and magnetic field should be small to get as large variation as possible .",
