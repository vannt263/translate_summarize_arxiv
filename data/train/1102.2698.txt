    "since the first detection of a deuterium - bearing molecule , dcn , by @xcite , it has become clear that the fraction of deuterium contained in molecules can be extremely high in the dense interstellar medium ( ism ) , with abundances of some deuterated species observed to be comparable to those of their hydrogenated counterparts .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the low atomic d / h ratio measured by absorption studies in the diffuse gas , which has an average value of @xmath2@xmath310@xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath5 ppm ) in the local ism @xcite .    the discovery of multiply deuterated molecules provided remarkable evidence to support the high molecular d / h ratios observed . based on the elemental d / h ratio",
    ", such species would be expected to have abundances of order 10@xmath6 or less , relative to their hydrogenated analogs .",
    "yet doubly deuterated ammonia , nd@xmath0h , was found to have an abundance ratio @xmath7/[nh_3]}$ ] of 0.5% in the dark cloud l134n @xcite and 3% in the prestellar core 16293e @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath8/[h_2co]}$ ] ratios ranging from 140% have been observed in low - mass protostars and prestellar cores @xcite .",
    "subsequent detections of chd@xmath0oh @xcite , d@xmath0s @xcite , and d@xmath0h@xmath9 @xcite showed similarly high abundance ratios .",
    "amazingly , molecules bearing three deuterons have also been detected , the first of which , triply deuterated ammonia , was observed to have an abundance ratio @xmath10/[nh_3]}\\sim0.1$]% in the dark cloud barnard 1 @xcite and in the class 0 protostar ngc1333 iras4a @xcite .",
    "triply deuterated methanol , cd@xmath11oh , has also been detected in the low - mass protostar iras 16293 - 2422 with an abundance ratio @xmath12/[ch_3oh]}\\sim1$]% @xcite .",
    "such extreme enhancement of the d / h ratio within molecules points to the dramatic efficiency of deuterium fractionation in cold dense molecular clouds , a process that was first proposed by @xcite .    at the low temperatures found in the cores of molecular clouds ( @xmath110  k ) , the process of fractionation acts to minimize the zero - point vibrational energy of molecules by swapping constituent atoms for their heavier isotopes .",
    "exchange reactions therefore lead to the preferential substitution of h by d in molecules .",
    "most gas - phase chemistry proceeds via ion - molecule reactions , the most important ion of which is h@xmath13 .",
    "deuteration of this species through the reaction @xmath14 is also preferred at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "reactions with abundant gas - phase species , such as co , o , and n@xmath0 , transfer the deuteron to other molecules and limit the amount of h@xmath0d@xmath9 that can be maintained , e.g. , @xmath15    in order for deuteration to proceed further and allow the formation of multiply deuterated species , h@xmath0d@xmath9 must survive long enough for it to undergo subsequent deuteron exchange : @xmath16 this is possible when the atoms and molecules that destroy it are removed from the gas phase by freeze - out onto grain surfaces @xcite .",
    "this occurs in the cold dense regions of the ism and the resulting depletion of abundant species , such as co , has been observed in many sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "direct evidence for the link between freeze - out and enhanced deuteration comes from the observed correlation between co depletion and the @xmath8/[h_2co]}$ ] ratio @xcite .",
    "grain - surface deuteration occurs by hydrogen abstraction and deuterium addition to mantle species on dust grains @xcite .",
    "this requires a reservoir of atomic deuterium to be maintained in the gas .",
    "this , again , is produced as a result of the h@xmath13@xmath17h@xmath0d@xmath9@xmath17d@xmath0h@xmath9@xmath17d@xmath13 series of reactions , with atomic deuterium a product of the dissociative recombination of these ions . for a more detailed discussion of deuterium chemistry ,",

    "studies of the atomic d / h ratio in the local ism provide an important constraint for models of galactic chemical evolution and insight into the processing of primordial gas up to the present era .",
    "values for the galactic d / h ratio are obtained by deriving column densities of and from observed lyman series absorption lines in interstellar gas toward background stars . since the first of these measurements",
    "were carried out , an unexpectedly large variation has emerged for sightlines extending beyond the local bubble , with values ranging from 5 to 22 ppm ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a recent discussion ) .",
    "this significant scatter is at odds with the more uniform values obtained for the primordial d / h ratio , as probed by quasar absorption line systems and inferred from cmb anisotropy data .",
    "these methods have yielded a fairly consistent value of @xmath18  ppm ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "other than big bang nucleosynthesis , no formation mechanism for deuterium is known to exist , and explanations for the varying d / h ratio therefore focus on ways to destroy or hide the deuterium .",
    "a corollary of this is that the highest observed values for the d / h ratio must be closest to the true value .",
    "the process of astration  the conversion of deuterium to @xmath19he , @xmath20he , and heavier elements via stellar nucleosynthesis  has long been proposed to explain the generally low values for the atomic d / h ratio measured in the galaxy , with differences in the degree of processing of the ism being suggested as an explanation for the observed scatter .",
    "an alternative theory has been proposed by @xcite , in which deuterium atoms deplete onto dust grains in quiescent regions of the interstellar medium and are subsequently returned to the gas phase if the grain mantles are destroyed .",
    "the observed correlation between metal depletion and decrease in the d / h ratio has been used to support this theory @xcite , which predicts that regions that have experienced some degree of dust destruction should display both higher gas - phase abundances of refractory metals ( titanium , iron , silicon , etc . ) and higher d / h ratios ( owing to the removal of both metals and deuterium from the grains ) .",
    "there are , however , outliers in these trends that disrupt the correlation and can not be explained by simple dust depletion models .",
    "one important process acts to _ increase _ the d / h ratio , namely the galactic infall of nearly pristine ( i.e. , unprocessed ) material ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the infalling material is not fully mixed with the existing ism , these inhomogeneities can also lead to variations in the observed d / h ratio .",
    "it is well established that molecular clouds are turbulent , and that turbulence plays an important  perhaps even dominant  role in governing the dynamics and support of these clouds .",
    "what is less certain is the extent to which turbulent eddies can transport the gas and dust within a cloud , disrupting the abundance profiles predicted by static chemical models and redistributing the atomic and molecular species .",
    "the effects of turbulence on cloud chemistry were first considered by @xcite .",
    "subsequent work on this subject ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has demonstrated that turbulent mixing under conditions that are typical of molecular clouds can lead to `` smearing out '' of the abundance gradients , reducing the variation with depth as the gas is transported between the cloud envelope and its interior .",
    "turbulent transport in molecular clouds is a diffusive process ( often called eddy diffusion ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the model employed in this work is derived from atmospheric chemical models in which the rate of turbulent transport for a given molecule depends on its abundance gradient .",
    "such models describe the turbulent mixing between adjacent zones as a fickian diffusion process with a diffusion coefficient @xmath21 derived from mixing length theory @xcite , a phenomenological approach analogous to the concept of the mean free path in thermodynamics . for full details of this model ,",
    "the reader is referred to the description contained in the original paper by @xcite .",
    "as already discussed , the process of deuterium fractionation is extremely efficient at altering the d / h ratio of molecules in the cold , dense cores of molecular clouds . indeed , @xcite suggest that this process may lead to a significant fraction of deuterium being locked in molecules in cloud centers .",
    "meanwhile , at the edges of these clouds and in diffuse regions of the ism , where the gas is warm and purely atomic , the observed atomic d / h ratio should reflect the `` true '' elemental value ( neglecting , for the moment , the possibility that deuterium may be also depleted onto dust grains ) .",
    "turbulent diffusion serves to mix these two phases of the ism  the warm diffuse material at the edge of clouds and the cold dense material in their centers  and in so doing , may alter the atomic d / h ratio observed at the cloud edge , as well as that in the cloud center .",
    "if this is the case , then the observed atomic d / h ratio along a particular line of sight will depend on a number of factors : 1 ) the degree of astration that the material along that sightline has been subjected to ; 2 ) the amount of deuterium that has been depleted onto dust grains ; 3 ) the efficiency of chemical fractionation in the gas along the sightline ; 4 ) the degree of turbulent mixing of the different phases of the ism ; 5 ) the proximity of the line of sight to a molecular cloud .",
    "in general , these mechanisms act to _ lower _ the value of the observed atomic d / h ratio .",
    "therefore , the highest observed value must be closest to the true elemental abundance ratio .",
    "we have examined the effects of turbulent diffusion on deuterium chemistry within molecular clouds and the resulting change in the abundances of key deuterated species .",
    "we also propose a process by which the variation in the measured atomic d / h ratio along diffuse lines of sight can be explained by turbulent mixing of the gas observed along these sightlines with denser material in neighboring regions .",
    "we describe the modifications made to the existing model for this work and the physical parameters of the cloud models considered in  [ the - model ] .",
    "the results of these models are presented in  [ results ] and their implications for the observed d / h ratio are discussed in  [ d - to - h - ratio ] .",

    "based on estimates of the correlation length in molecular clouds ( 0.10.5  pc ) and typical turbulent velocities ( 0.11  kms@xmath35 ) , we consider values of @xmath21 between 0 ( i.e. , no diffusion ) and @xmath39 .    in this work ,",

    "hd , however , is not only formed on grains , but can also form efficiently in the gas phase by the reaction @xmath73 indeed , in the warm diffuse cloud envelope , where the d@xmath9 abundance is high due to charge exchange between d and h@xmath9 , and h@xmath0 begins to become abundant , this gas - phase reaction becomes the dominant formation route for hd .",

    "this allows certain deuterated species to attain higher abundances within the region of low extinction than can be produced by static cloud models , where the effects of photodissociation , lower density , and higher temperature inhibit the formation of such species .",

    "we note that observations of h@xmath13 in diffuse clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "these rates are up to an order of magnitude greater than the standard rate considered in our model .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of this paper to examine the possible influence of varying model parameters such as the cosmic ray ionization rate on the deuterium chemistry , it is worth mentioning that an order of magnitude increase in the rate would lead to higher h@xmath13 and electron abundances in the model , which would likely reduce the level of deuteration that could be achieved . since",
    "turbulent diffusion is effective at redistributing species between the cloud core and envelope , this would likely lead to an overall reduction in the level of deuteration throughout the cloud .",

    "many of the parameters that govern the relative contribution of each process , such as the initial abundances , dust composition , turbulent diffusion coefficient , and ionization fraction , are hard to determine with any precision , making it difficult to disentangle the various processes involved , or to say difinitively if one process is dominating . the turbulent diffusion mechanism proposed here could be tested by searching for a correlation between observed d / h ratios and a proxy for the degree of turbulence along each line of sight , such as the turbulent linewidths of the absorption lines , though the analysis would be complicated by additional uncertainties due to overlapping absorption components and bulk cloud motions .    with the exception of galactic infall of low metallicity material , all mechanisms that have so far been proposed to explain the variation in atomic d / h ratio result in lower values .",

    "the turbulent mixing of atomic and molecular gas at the edges of molecular clouds discussed here is an alternative mechanism that can explain the scatter in atomic d / h ratios observed beyond the local bubble .",

    "<S> the influence of turbulent mixing on the chemistry of the interstellar medium has so far received little attention . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies of this effect have suggested that it might play an important role in mixing the various phases of the interstellar medium . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we examine the potential effects of turbulent diffusion on the deuterium chemistry within molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we find that such mixing acts to reduce the efficiency of deuteration in these clouds by increasing the ionization fraction and reducing freeze - out of heavy molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to lower abundances for many deuterated species . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the influence of turbulent mixing on the transition from atomic hydrogen to h@xmath0 and from atomic deuterium to hd near the cloud edge . </S>",
    "<S> we find that including turbulent diffusion in our models serves to push these transitions deeper into the cloud and helps maintain a higher atomic fraction throughout the cloud envelope . </S>",
    "<S> based on these findings , we propose a new process to account for the significant scatter in the observed atomic d / h ratio for galactic sightlines extending beyond the local bubble . </S>",
    "<S> although several mechanisms have been put forward to explain this scatter , they are unable to fully account for the range in d / h values . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a scenario in which turbulent mixing of atomic and molecular gas at the edges of molecular clouds causes the observed atomic d / h ratio to vary by a factor of @xmath12 . </S>"
