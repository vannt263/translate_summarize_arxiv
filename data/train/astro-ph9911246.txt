    "here @xmath15 is the density of relativistic matter ( photons and other relativistic particles ) in the radiation - dominated era and the density of nonrelativistic matter ( mainly luminous and nonluminous baryons and possibly massive particles such as axions ) in the matter - dominated era .",

    "( 1997 ) value of @xmath18 is reduced to @xmath33 .",

    "long before _ hipparcos _ , when the estimated ages of the globular clusters were in the range @xmath29 and hence the age problem was starker , an immediate solution to this likely problem was provided in the 1980 s by including a ( time - independent ) cosmological constant @xmath14 as in eq.(2 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another solution to this problem was given by olson & jordan ( 1987 ) in the framework of a time - varying cosmological constant .",
    "they showed that in a flat universe with @xmath12 ages of the universe old enough to agree with observations ( in the 1980 s ) could be obtained with background energy densities of the form @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "still another potential function of a time - varying cosmological constant is that the vacuum energy density associated with it can be interpreted as the density of dark matter .",
    "the nature of the dark matter that is supposed to exist around galaxies has been another most debated mysteries of astronomy and cosmology .",
    "many relativistic and nonrelativistic particles have been proposed as candidates for dark matter ( see the latest reviews by primack ( 1996 ) and srednicki ( 1996 ) ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study a phenomenological cosmological model based on the vacuum energy density @xmath62 ( see eq.([eqn : rholambda ] ) below ) in the matter dominated era and show that ( i ) the part of @xmath63 decaying as @xmath0 leads to an effective curvature constant @xmath3 , and it is @xmath3 that governs the fate of the universe , ( ii ) such a @xmath63 solves the age problem of the universe , and ( iii ) @xmath63 serves as dark matter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we mention the time - varying cosmological constant models briefly , and introduce in section 3 the model we study in this paper .",
    "we then present our calculations under two different assumptions regarding the interaction of the vacuum with matter .",
    "section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "the time - varying cosmological constant models with @xmath64 were introduced by zer & taha ( 1986 , 1987 ) in an attempt to solve the cosmological problems such as the initial singularity , horizon , entropy , monopole , and cosmological constant problem ( see weinberg ( 1989 ) for a review of the cosmological constant problem ) .",
    "the idea of zer & taha ( 1986 , 1987 ) was then extended to include a large variety of varying cosmological constants decaying as @xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1992 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "it was shown by chen & wu ( 1990 , 1992 ) that very general arguments from quantum cosmology lead to this form for the effective cosmological constant ( see below ) .",
    "any cosmological model with a cosmological constant is based on the observation that there is an associated energy density @xmath65 in terms of which eq.([eqn : friedmann1 ] ) can be written as @xmath66-\\frac{k}{a^2}. \\label{eqn : friedmann2}\\ ] ] the energy density @xmath67 is interpreted as the vacuum energy density ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as we have stated above , in this paper we shall consider models in which the dependence of the vacuum energy on the scale factor @xmath1 is of the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are constants , @xmath24 and @xmath71 are the present values of the matter energy density @xmath24 and the scale factor @xmath1 . the reason for adopting the variable part of @xmath72 is manyfolds .",
    "first , postulating that @xmath73 @xmath74 , it is only for @xmath75 that an effective curvature constant @xmath3 can be defined .",
    "second , observing that the cosmological constant @xmath14 has dimension of inverse lenght squared , the simplest scale factor dependence of @xmath14 would be @xmath76 .",
    "this is the case here because the time - varying cosmological constant that corresponds to eq.([eqn : rholambda ] ) has the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are constants , and corresponds to a special case of the form considered by matyjasek ( 1995 ) .",
    "third , on dimensional grounds again , @xmath14 can be written as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the planck lenght . in a classical theory such as general relativity an @xmath82 dependence in @xmath14",
    "is not expected .",
    "the correct choice for @xmath83 , therefore , is 2 ( chen & wu 1990 ; waga 1993 ) .",
    "we have included the constant term in eq.(6 ) so as to be able to compare the variable term with it .    denoting by @xmath84 the sum of luminous and non luminous ( dark ) baryonic energy densities , and by @xmath85 the sum of non baryonic energy densities",
    "the total matter density is @xmath86 .",
    "the main argument for baryonic dark matter ( see @xcite for a review ) is associated with the successful calculations in the standard model of the primordial abundances of light elements @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "these predictions apply only if the baryon density parameter lies in the range @xmath88 ( @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the density parameter @xmath89 of the luminous baryons is certainly below this range .",
    "therefore there must be a significant amount of nonluminous baryonic matter in the universe .    to proceed further , we need to make an assumption about the interaction of matter with the variable vacuum energy .",
    "there are two possibilities leading to two distinct models .",
    "matter and the time - dependent vacuum do not interact with each other . in this case",
    "the energy conservation equation @xmath90+[p_m(t)+p_{\\lambda}(t)]da^3=0 \\label{eqn : energy}\\ ] ] with @xmath91 leads to    @xmath92=0,\\\\ d[\\rho_{\\lambda}(t)a^3]+p_{\\lambda}(t)da^3=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from which we obtain @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "as this is the only 4x4 matrix that is invariant under lorentz boosts . on the other hand , the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid is of the form @xmath95 .",
    "hence vacuum must be a perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath6 .",
    "in general , this does not require that the vacuum energy and hence the cosmological constant be time - independent .",
    "@xmath96 may be varying with the time . to qualify as a vacuum energy it suffices for @xmath96 to satisfy the above vacuum equation of state .",
    "however , in the literature a time - varying cosmological term that does not strictly satisfy @xmath6 has also been called `` time - varying cosmological constant '' or `` time - varying vacuum energy '' ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our model 1 does not satisfy the vacuum equation of state if @xmath97 .",
    "we shall , however , consider later a model that satisfies it as a special case ( see model 2 , section 3.2 ) ] the friedmann equation ( [ eqn : friedmann2 ] ) then becomes    @xmath98-\\frac{k}{a^2},\\label{eqn : friedmann3a}\\\\ & = & \\frac{8\\pi g}{3}\\rho_{m}\\left[\\frac{a_0 ^ 3}{a^3}+c_1 \\right]-\\frac{k_{eff}}{a^2 } , \\label{eqn : friedmann3b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have defined @xmath99 eq.([eqn : friedmann3b ] ) suggests that the fate of the universe in regard to whether it will expand forever or collapse in the future is determined not by @xmath2 , as opposed to the standard model , but by @xmath3 .",
    "this is a rather interesting feature of the models with @xmath100 varying as @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , this feature has not been appreciated in the literature well enough .",
    "it seems from eq.([eqn : keff ] ) that the curvature constant may take on any of the three values 1 , 0 , and -1 .",
    "if , however , one desires a universe that does not suffer from the initial singularity , horizon , and entropy problems , one must then consider the extension of this model to the very early universe .",
    "there one finds that with a vacuum energy decaying as @xmath0 the universe does not suffer from these problems only if @xmath4 ( @xcite , 1987 ) .",
    "note the intriguing possibility that the universe simulates the expansion dynamics of a flat universe even though it is closed ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this occurs for @xmath5 , which is realized if @xmath101 expressing eq.([eqn : friedmann3b ] ) in terms of the present quantities yields @xmath102 on the other hand , if @xmath70 is greater than that in eq.(12 ) @xmath3 will be negative and the expansion dynamics of the universe will be similar to that of an open universe .",
    "a time - independent cosmological constant has usually been invoked for two purposes .",
    "first , for large @xmath18 , to increase the age of the universe to the level of the pre _ hipparcos _ globular cluster age .",
    "second , to obtain a spatially flat universe for low @xmath22 , as generally implied by inflationary models , so that @xmath103 . but",
    "does a non - vanishing time - independent cosmological constant really exist ?",
    "hence it is most important to search for ways in which its existence can be tested .",
    "fukugita , futamase & kasai ( 1990 ) have argued that a statistical study of gravitational lenses could provide for such a test .",
    "they have pointed out that with a cosmological constant the gravitational lensing optical depth ( integrated probability ) increases very rapidly as the source redshift increases . however",
    ", they do not make any direct comparison to observational data .",
    "this has been attempted by turner ( 1990 ) .",
    "using the available data on the frequency of multiple image lensing of high - redshift quasars by galaxies turner ( 1990 ) has shown that spatially flat @xmath12 models with small values of @xmath22 and correspondingly large values of @xmath104 all predict much larger values of the gravitational optical depth .",
    "he then concludes that if @xmath12 then @xmath105 and @xmath106 seems to be the favored possibility .",
    "later on , kochanek ( 1993,1995 ) and maoz & rix ( 1993 ) have managed to put upper bounds on using the statistics of lenses .",
    "kochanek ( 1993 , 1995 ) finds that in a flat universe the upper limit on @xmath104 can be as high as 0.8 or as low as 0.65 .",
    "the investigations of maoz & rix ( 1993 ) constrain @xmath104 to be @xmath107 , also for a spatially flat universe , and lead them to conclude robustly that a ( time - independent ) cosmological constant no longer provides an attractive solution for the age problem of the universe then .",
    "recently , the supernova magnitude - redshift approach has given a value for @xmath104 somewhat smaller than the gravitational lens upper limit of kochanek ( 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "using the initial seven of more than 28 supernovae discovered , the supernova cosmology project has also measured @xmath22 and @xmath104 ( @xcite ) .",
    "they find @xmath108 for a @xmath109 cosmology , and @xmath110 and @xmath111 for a flat universe .",
    "they find that @xmath112 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "they , too , conclude that the results for @xmath104-versus-@xmath22 are inconsistent with @xmath14-dominated , low density , flat cosmologies that have been proposed to reconcile the ( pre _ hipparcos _ ) ages of globular cluster stars with large hubble constant values . for the more general case of a friedmann - lematre cosmology with the sum of @xmath22 and @xmath104 unconstrained ,",
    "they find the lower limit @xmath113 and the upper limit @xmath114 for @xmath115 , or @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "their limits are significantly tighter than the previous limits of carroll , press & turner ( 1992 ) .",
    "we next examine whether our model 1 passes the test of gravitational lensing .",
    "the integrated probability , the so - called optical depth , for lensing by a population of singular isothermal spheres of constant comoving density normalized by the fiducial case of the sm , the einstein - de sitter model , is @xmath118^{-3 } \\int_0^{z_s}\\frac{(1+z)^2}{e(z)}\\left[\\frac{d(0 , z)d(z , z_s)}{d(0 , z_s ) } \\right]^2dz \\label{eqn : plens}\\ ] ] ( @xcite ) , ) that the present matter pressure is negligible ; hence @xmath119 .",

    "equation ( [ eqn : friedmann3a ] ) or ( [ eqn : friedmann3b ] ) gives @xmath137 where we have used the constraint @xmath138 to eliminate @xmath139 .",

    "taking the upper bound on @xmath104 as 0.5 ( @xcite ) we see that the corresponding lensing prediction is @xmath142 .",
    "hence , we shall assume in the following that the maximum tolerable value is about 2 .",
    "the predictions increase very rapidly for larger source redshifts .",
    "we present a sample from our predictions for @xmath4 and @xmath5 in figure 2 subject to the constraint equation ( [ eqn : sumofomegas ] ) from which it follows in this case that @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",

    "next we address ourselves the question of whether the ages in the sm that are below the _ hipparcos _ lower limit of @xmath7 in figure 1 could be raised to @xmath7 with the help of a decaying cosmological term as considered in this section . starting with @xmath155 , we have determined the value of @xmath69 , by trial and error from eq.([eqn : h0t0 - 1 ] ) , that gives the age as @xmath7 for a certain @xmath156 .",

    "thus this case can survive only if the parameter @xmath43 is @xmath192 ( see figure 1 ) . for @xmath5 eq.([eqn : h0t0 - 3 ] ) reduces to @xmath193 for positive @xmath69 , and to @xmath194 for negative @xmath69 .",
    "we see upon examining eq.([eqn : negc1 ] ) that the possibility of negative @xmath69 aggravates the age problem very severely .",
    "the special case with @xmath185 offers further possibilities . for @xmath195 eq.([eqn : h0t0 - 3 ] ) reduces to @xmath196\\omega_m\\ } } \\nonumber \\\\         & \\times & \\left[1-\\frac{[1+(3w+1)c_2]\\omega_{m}}{\\{1-[1+(3w+1)c_2 ] \\omega_{m}\\}^{1/2}}\\sinh^{-1}\\{[1+(3w+1)c_2 ] \\omega_{m}]^{-1}-1\\}^{1/2}\\right],\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{(1-\\omega_{{m}_{eff}})^{1/2}}\\left[1-\\frac{\\omega_{{m}_{eff } } } { ( 1-\\omega_{{m}_{eff}})^{1/2}}\\sinh^{-1}(\\omega_{{m}_{eff}}-1)^{1/2}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected , this is similar to the sm expression for @xmath11 , eq.(@xmath197 ) , and @xmath3 is negative as long as @xmath185 and @xmath195 . in particular , for @xmath198 and @xmath199 equations ( [ eqn : h0t0 - 3 ] ) and ( [ eqn : h0t0 - 4 ] ) reduce to eq.(@xmath197 ) . for @xmath198 and @xmath200 @xmath3 is positive and eq.([eqn : h0t0 - 3 ] ) reduces to eq.(@xmath201 ) , which is the @xmath4 case of the sm .",
    "once again we emphasize that it is @xmath3 but not @xmath2 that determines the expansion fate of the universe . in table 2",
    "we show the values of @xmath70 that are required to raise the age to @xmath7 against @xmath22 and @xmath43 for @xmath185 and @xmath172 .",
    "the lensing predictions now are very promising and it seems that values of @xmath43 greater than 0.8 may be allowed . as can be seen from eq.([eqn : h0t0 - 4 ] ) that the maximum value of @xmath154 when @xmath185 for negative @xmath3 is unity , in which case the age of the universe is @xmath202 .",
    "the noteworthy point here is that the @xmath154 values near one are obtained for all values of @xmath22(see figure 5 ) , whereas in the sm a value for @xmath154 as large as unity can only be obtained as @xmath22 tends to zero for @xmath11 ( see eq.(@xmath197 ) .    in tables 3 , 4 and 5",
    "we display the @xmath154 and @xmath145 predictions for @xmath172 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 , respectively .",
    "a value of @xmath70 near @xmath205 increases the age by @xmath206 to @xmath207 percent over the sm as @xmath22 increases from @xmath208 to @xmath59 , while @xmath145 remains within the acceptable range for @xmath172 and @xmath204 but increases slightly over 2 for @xmath209 .",
    "the cases with @xmath172 in tables 2 and 3 are particularly interesting because they have a strictly vacuum equation of state , i.e. @xmath210 .    finally we note that an independent estimate on @xmath211 can be obtained as follows : comparing eq.([eqn : rholambda ] ) with eq.([eqn : lambda ] ) yields @xmath212 where we have retained the speed of light @xmath16 . dividing through by @xmath213 we get @xmath214 which is consistent with @xmath215 .",
    "the ongoing recent research in cosmology and related fields reveals that it is still taken for granted by most people that the cosmological constant is a true constant which does not change with time .",
    "we have shown in our phenomenological model here that the vacuum equation of state @xmath6 may be realized with a time - dependent cosmological term ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a truly time - independent cosmological constant itself introduces a very serious problem , the so called cosmological constant problem ( @xcite ) , to which no satisfactory solution has been found so far . in view of the cosmological constant problem and the suggested solution to it ( @xcite , 1987 ) we can not think of a mechanism to reduce the constant term in eq.([eqn : rholambda ] ) from its very large value in the early universe to its observational limits today .",
    "gravitational lensing statistics limit the value of such a constant term to a level that it can not help increase the age of the universe to the _ hipparcos _ lower limit of @xmath7 for all @xmath43 up to 0.8 . if the present value of the matter density parameter is low enough neither can it help to have a @xmath12 universe in the friedmann models .",
    "thus it just seems redundant .",
    "we , therefore , believe very strongly that there should be no such constant component in @xmath67 .",
    "it is only natural to associate a temperature with the vacuum energy . assuming that the vacuum , which had enormous energy in the early universe , was in thermal equilibrium with the matter content of the universe at least during some period in the past , it is necessary that the temperature of the vacuum decreases with the expansion of the universe ( @xcite , 1988 ) .",
    "thus a decaying vacuum energy or equivalently a decaying cosmological constant seems to be more plausible than a time - independent one .",
    "we have shown in this work that , a decaying cosmological constant can increase the age to 11 gyr without running into conflicts with the gravitational lensing predictions for all @xmath216 , and even for larger values provided the vacuum and matter interact with each other ( as in our model 2 ) .",
    "we have also argued here that a decaying cosmological constant can serve as dark matter .",
    "a very intriguing possibility is that a cosmological constant decaying as @xmath0 necessitates the definition of an effective curvature constant @xmath3 , which in turn may cause a closed universe ( with @xmath4 ) to have similar expansion dynamics as a flat universe if @xmath5 or as an open universe if @xmath217 . in our opinion , this is an intriguing possibility of such cosmologies that deserve further study .",
    "however , these are not the only successes of such cosmologies .",
    "we should like to mention that these models do not suffer from cosmological problems such as the initial singularity , horizon , and entropy problems of the standard model and thus yield a problem free universe ( @xcite , 1987 ) .    the interesting and ultimate question is to explain how a time - dependent term , and in particular one decaying as @xmath0 can arise in the first place .",
    "a first attempt in this direction has been undertaken by peebles & ratra ( 1988 ) and ratra & peebles ( 1988 ) .",
    "they have considered a model in which the vacuum energy @xmath67 depends on a scalar field that changes as the universe expands ( see also @xcite ) . in the two string - motivated scalar - field",
    "cosmological models of zer & taha ( 1992 ) the universe is closed and non - singular .",
    "the scalar fields have a negative pressure of @xmath218 and @xmath219 in these models .",
    "furthermore , the energy density @xmath220 of the scalar field decays like @xmath0 .",
    "hence these scalar field models mimic the decaying cosmological constant models considered here .",
    "this endeavor is currently under further investigation .",
    "other objects whose energy densities decrease as @xmath0 are the textures , which are topological defects .",
    "the most studied such objects are the non - abelian cosmic strings ( @xcite ) . if strings do not intercommute nor pass through each other , then their energy density scale as @xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a closed universe with @xmath199 and some form of matter ( a scalar field , a cosmic string or some other stable texture ) with an equation of state @xmath221 and energy density @xmath222 scaling as @xmath0 was considered by kamionkowski & toumbas ( 1996 ) .",
    "another work which is also similar to the present one is the work of spergel & pen ( 1996 ) who considered a flat universe dominated at present by cosmic strings .",
    "the universe in these two models locally resemble an open universe , namely @xmath217 even though @xmath4 in the first and 0 in the second one .",
    "these authors argue that such cosmological models are currently viable and thus represent alternatives to the sm .    in conclusion , phenomenological cosmological models or their field theoretic partners based on a vacuum energy of the form @xmath62 , preferably with @xmath185 , can raise the age of the universe up to the _ hipparcos _ lower limit of @xmath7 and serve as dark matter . when @xmath185 the maximum value of @xmath154 is equal to one corresponding to @xmath223 , and there is no problem with the age even if @xmath43 is as large as 0.85 .",
