    "the general understanding of the relation between chaos in classical systems , and ergodicity and thermalization is still far from complete nowadays .",
    "intuitively , one expects from high - dimensional , non - integrable complex systems to demonstrate strong chaos and thus it seems reasonable to expect thermalization .",
    "this is essentially the fundamental assumption of classical thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the conditions under which this assumption can be safely made , however , is still an open question .",
    "it is not known what level of `` chaoticity '' or `` complexity '' is required to ensure thermalizing behavior .",
    "chaos can be often seen as a consequence of nonlinear perturbations of an integrable system .",
    "the solutions of the unperturbed , integrable part of such a system are called modes . starting with only a few initially excited modes",
    ", one can view thermalization as spreading in the mode - space , i.e. the excitation of new modes , due to the nonlinear chaotic interactions .",
    "however , already the first attempts to follow such a thermalization of modes initiated by fermi , pasta , and ulam revealed many extremely nontrivial effects , still not completely understood ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent progress of the fpu problem ) .",
    "a very important case is when the integrable modes are spatially localized .",
    "then the thermalization process is a spatial diffusion where more and more modes get excited .",
    "this allows to connect the rather abstract concept of thermalization in the mode - space with the very intuitive phenomenon of spatial diffusion . a prominent example where",
    "this has been studied very extensively in the past , is the interplay between nonlinearity and disorder . in this case ,",
    "due to anderson localization , linear eigenmodes are exponentially localized and the spectrum is purely discrete  @xcite .",
    "recent numerical experiments with nonlinear disordered lattices have demonstrated that the initially localized wave packets spread in a very weak , subdiffusive manner  @xcite . a complete theoretical understanding of the subdiffusive behavior has not been presented , but it is mostly agreed on that the spreading in these models is induced by weak chaos .",
    "however , the true asymptotic behavior is still discussed in some of these models with recent claims that spreading might stop due to an extinction of chaos  @xcite .    in this paper we follow the scaling approach to this problem , first formulated in @xcite and recently extended to two - dimensional systems  @xcite . we will try to establish and to check numerically the scaling relations for the properties of spreading , in dependence on the total energy of the initial wave packet . in these works , the nonlinear diffusion equation ( nde ) was proposed to describe the spreading process and this assumption was verified by several numerical simulations . here , we will generalize this model by introducing the fractional nonlinear diffusion equation ( fnde ) , and we will present new numerical results that will show that in some cases indeed only the fnde gives a correct scaling description of the spreading process .",
    "we formulate the scaling relations based on this equation , and check their validity for nonlinear lattices .",
    "we will start with formulating the object of our study , strongly nonlinear hamiltonian lattices .",
    "we present a phenomenology of energy spreading and define the statistical quantities characterizing it in section [ sec : snl ] .",

    "we derive spreading predictions for the strongly nonlinear hamiltonian lattices . in section  [ sec : nres ] we present extensive numerical calculations for different classes of the nonlinearity .",
    "these results are compared with the predictions from the fnde and we identify different degrees of confirmation for different nonlinear classes .",

    "the main goal of this paper is to study properties of energy spreading in strongly nonlinear lattices . by",
    "strongly nonlinear we understand lattices where the coupling is described by nonlinear functions that disappear in the linear limit .",
    "so there are no linear waves ( phonons ) in such lattices and energy transport can solely be induced by the nonlinear coupling .",
    "such lattices can be introduced in the framework of equations for the complex amplitudes ( and then one obtains a strongly nonlinear generalization of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ) or as a generalization of a hamiltonian klein - gordon lattice . in this work we follow the latter way .",
    "moreover , we restrict ourselves to pure power - law nonlinearities .      in one dimension we formulate a strongly nonlinear lattice in terms of a hamilton function for positions  @xmath0 and momenta  @xmath1 of oscillators labelled by site index @xmath2 : @xmath3 here @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the powers of the on - site potential and the coupling term , respectively . for @xmath6",
    "we have a chain of nonlinearly coupled linear on - site oscillators ; for @xmath7 the on - site oscillators are nonlinear as well .",
    "below we study situations with and without disorder , the latter is introduced via the variations of the parameters of the local potential @xmath8 ( these are linear frequences of the oscillators if @xmath6 and parameters of the nonlinear on - site potential if @xmath7 ) .",

    "instead , one can use the remaining freedom to set the total energy @xmath15 to unity : @xmath22 particularly , this means that the energy is not a free parameter of the system but can rather be scaled to , say , @xmath23 , what also involves an appropriate change of the time scale .",

    "<S> we study scaling properties of energy spreading in disordered strongly nonlinear hamiltonian lattices . </S>",
    "<S> such lattices consist of nonlinearly coupled local linear or nonlinear oscillators , and demonstrate a rather slow , subdiffusive spreading of initially localized wave packets . </S>",
    "<S> we use a fractional nonlinear diffusion equation as a heuristic model of this process , and confirm that the scaling predictions resulting from a self - similar solution of this equation are indeed applicable to all studied cases . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the spreading in nonlinearly coupled linear oscillators slows down compared to a pure power law , while for nonlinear local oscillators a power law is valid in the whole studied range of parameters . </S>"
