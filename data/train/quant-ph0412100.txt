    "collective features in the microscopic dynamics often lead to the emergence of surprising and unexpected effects in the evolution of a physical system at the macroscopic level @xcite .",
    "the collective cooling of many two - level particles to very low temperatures is discussed here as an example of such a macroscopic manifestation of microscopic collective behavior @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the collective behavior of a large number of particles can produce much higher cooling rates than they could be achieved by means of individual cooling based on the spontaneous decay of the individual particles @xcite .",
    "as in laser sideband cooling techniques for single two - level atoms @xcite , we consider an experimental setup , where red - detuned laser fields increase the excitation of the particles , thereby continuously reducing the number of phonons .",
    "afterwards , the phonon energy can be removed constantly from the system .",
    "this requires energy dissipation and yields an overall decrease of the von neumann entropy in the setup @xcite .",
    "one possible decay channel is spontaneous emission from the excited states of the particles . during such a photon emission ,",
    "a particle returns most likely into its ground state without regaining the phonon energy lost in the excitation process .",
    "the net result is a _ conversion _ of the phonons , originally existing in the setup in the form of thermal energy , into photons escaping the system .",
    "here we are interested in realizing much higher cooling rates than could be achieved with the help of the above described spontaneous decay of individual particles .",
    "this is possible , when the time evolution of the system remains restricted onto a highly symmetric and strongly coupling subspace of states throughout the whole cooling process .",
    "maximum cooling is obtained when the particles exhibit _ cooperative _ behavior in the excitation step as well as in the de - excitation step . to achieve this we assume as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the outward energy dissipation is conducted by an optical cavity . as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , the particles should be placed inside a resonant optical cavity with a relatively large rate for the leakage of photons through the cavity mirrors .",

    "the number of phonons decreases exponentially with a with as large as @xmath1 times the single - particle coupling constants , which can be much higher than previously predicted cooling rates in comparable setups @xcite .",
    "the proposed cooling scheme might be used to cool a large number of particles very efficiently .",
    "so it should be applicable to the preparation of bose einstein condensates .",
    "currently , these experiments mainly use evaporative cooling @xcite which systematically removes those atoms with a relatively high temperature from the trap .",
    "consequently , only a small percentage of the initially trapped atoms is finally included in the condensate .",
    "if one could instead cool all the atoms efficiently , yet at the same time avoid the loss of particles , it should become easier to experiment with large condensates .",
    "cooling is also crucial for ion trap quantum computing , where the achievable gate operation times can depend primarily on the efficiency of the cooling of a common vibrational mode @xcite .",

    "one can easily see that the dissipation of cavity photons reduces the energy in the system without affecting the state of the particles .",

    "however , this does not apply to the emission of photons from the particles , which can negatively interfere with the collective cooling process .",
    "in case of the cooling of common vibrational modes , the setup consists effectively of _ two _ different subsystems .",
    "one is the two - level particle system . as an effect of the emergence of the cooperative behavior ,",
    "the collection of particles manifests itself as a _",
    "bosonic _ system .",
    "we will see below that a further consequence of this is the transition to a strong coupling regime , which in turn implies a much shorter time scale for the system evolution .",
    "the other subsystem is the bosonic system of phonons and photons with a continuous _ conversion _ of phonons into photons .",
    "we will see that it is convenient to consider a boson mode which is a superposition of them .",
    "this is analogous to the field - atom polariton of hopfield @xcite .",
    "the physical implication of the familiar commutator relations ( [ e2 ] ) is that the particles behave no longer like _",
    "individual fermions_. instead , the time evolution generates the excitation of bosonic modes , namely collective dipole waves , with @xmath39 denoting the creation and annihilation operators of the associated quanta obeying the usual commutation relation ( [ e2 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the collection of the single two - level particles manifests itself as a _",
    "bosonic _ system .",
    "in other words , the ladder of equally - spaced dicke states approximates to a weakly - excited harmonic oscillator .    using the operators ( [ col ] ) ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hi ] ) for the cooling of _ common _ vibrational modes can simply be written as @xmath41 where we have introduced the notation @xmath42 from this one sees that the time evolution of the system is mainly governed by the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath9 , which scale as @xmath1 .",
    "we thus have , as a consequence of the emergence of the particle collective behavior , the transition to the strong coupling regime , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the evolution of the system happens no longer on the time scale given by the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath4 but on a much shorter time scale defined by @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "another factor that contributes significantly to the described cooling mechanism is the _ interface _ or _",
    "ambivalent _ role played by the particles with respect to the phonons and the photons in the setup .",
    "the only difference between the particle - phonon and particle - photon interaction is the difference of the coupling constants , given by @xmath50 and @xmath49 , respectively . in some sense , the particles act as an engine transforming phonon energy into photon energy .",
    "this last one is then dissipated outward through the coupling with the cavity which allows energy leakage .",
    "however , in the absence of the leakage of photons through the cavity , the inverse transformation , photons to phonons , is also possible in principle . in such a situation ,",
    "interesting interference and coherence effects arise , which we analyze below in detail .",

    "inevitably , it also creates a coherence between the @xmath57 and the @xmath13 subsystem .",
    "this coherence @xmath5 provides a  symmetric \" channel for the phonon - photon energy transformation .",
    "however , the leakage of energy outside the cavity perturbs such a symmetric phonon - photon balancing due to the @xmath5 action .",
    "the system reacts by subsequent adjustments , trying to recover its lost balance .",
    "crucial to such a re - adjustment mechanism is the difference in the time scales .",
    "the time scale for reaching the quasi - stationary state is of the order @xmath58 , while the time scale for spontaneous decay is , as we see in the next section , of order @xmath59 .",
    "the time evolution of the system turns out to be highly non - linear since the second and higher order derivatives of the physical observables are much larger than their first order derivatives .",
    "the system reaches a quasi - stationary state on a time scale of the order @xmath58 .",

    "especially , the conservation of @xmath70 implies the conservation of the total number of bosons , as accounted for by the number operator @xmath71 .    when the number of particles in the excited state @xmath7 remains small compared to @xmath0 , the commutator relations ( [ e2 ] ) hold . in such a case",

    "considering again the heisenberg picture , we indeed find @xmath75 in the presence of many particles , with most of them remaining in their ground state , the expectation value of @xmath64 remains negligible .",

( [ m ] ) implies , due to the conservation laws ( [ cons ] ) and ( [ cons2 ] ) , that @xmath88 this means that , after a short time of order @xmath58 , the system reaches a quasi - stationary state with a constant ratio between the expectation value of the coherence @xmath5 and the number of photons inside the cavity , respectively , compared to the total number of phonons in the system . to a very good approximation ,",
