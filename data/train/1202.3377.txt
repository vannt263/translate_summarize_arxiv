    "inclusive mesons from transversely polarized @xmath4 collisions have an analyzing power , @xmath6 , which provides insight into the composite structure of the proton . the analyzing power , or transverse single spin asymmetry , is quantified by taking the ratio of the difference and sum of independent polarized processes : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the average beam polarization , @xmath9 is a geometric scale factor that corrects for the azimuthal acceptance of the detector , and @xmath10(@xmath11 ) is the meson production cross section from @xmath12(@xmath13 ) + @xmath14 beam crossings . in prior measurements , non - zero",
    "transverse single spin asymmetries have been measured for charged @xcite and neutral @xcite pions at large feynman-@xmath15 ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the momentum of the meson along the beam direction ) at various collision energies .",
    "the transverse single spin asymmetry of eta mesons have also been measured by the fnal - e704 @xcite and star @xcite experiments , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : etaan ] .",
    "fnal - e704 measured similar asymmetries for neutral pions and eta mesons at @xmath5 = 19 gev ; star measured a larger asymmetry for eta mesons compared to neutral pions at @xmath180.55 .    two previous measurements of eta meson transverse single spin asymmetry .",
    "the left figure shows results from fnal - e704 at @xmath5 = 19.4 gev @xcite .",
    "the right figure shows preliminary results from the star experiment at @xmath5 = 200 gev @xcite . ]    since collinear pqcd at leading twist predicts a small spin asymmetry due to the hard partonic scattering , initial and final states of the interacting partons and fragmenting hadrons have to be considered .",
    "three main explanations have been developed to explain these transverse single spin asymmetries : the sivers effect @xcite , the collins effect @xcite , higher twist effects @xcite , or some combination of the three .",
    "the goal of this analysis is the extraction of the inclusive eta meson transverse single spin asymmetry at forward rapidity at phenix @xcite . in 2008 ,",
    "the phenix experiment collected 5.2 pb@xmath3 integrated luminosity in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath5 = 200 gev , with an average beam polarization of 45@xmath19 .",
    "for the analysis of the forward eta meson transverse single spin asymmetry in phenix , the muon piston calorimeter ( mpc ) is being used@xcite .",
    "the mpc consists of two forward electromagnetic calorimeters , referred to as the south ( north ) mpc , placed @xmath20220 cm from the nominal interaction point at a pseudorapidity of 3.1 @xmath21 3.9 .",
    "each mpc comprises 196 ( 220 ) @xmath22 crystal towers , with dimensions of @xmath23@xmath24 .",
    "the mpc can identify neutral pions and eta mesons by reconstruction of their decay photons .",
    "all pairs of photon candidates are used to form an invariant mass .",
    "real photon pairs originating from eta meson decays will form a pair - mass close to the mass of the eta meson .",
    "phenix operates within the rhic accelerator , which provides two counter - circulating proton beams at various energies up to @xmath5 = 500 gev .",
    "a feature of rhic is its capability to provide polarized proton beams independently in both directions , allowing for two independent transverse single spin asymmetry measurements by integrating over one beam polarization at a time .    in order to record the data ,",
    "two triggers are used : a minimum bias ( mb ) trigger which uses the beam - beam counters only , and a high energy cluster ( hec ) trigger in which a @xmath25 tower energy sum ( threshold of @xmath26 @xmath27 20 gev ) in the mpc is used to initiate readout of the detector .",
    "the mb trigger allows for measurement of the eta meson yield in the region of 1 @xmath28 2 gev/@xmath29 ( 0.2 @xmath30 0.4 ) , where @xmath31 is the transverse momentum of the eta meson normal to the beam direction .",
    "the hec triggered dataset allows reconstruction of eta mesons in the region 2 @xmath28 4.5 gev/@xmath29 ( 0.3 @xmath30 0.7 ) . figure  [ fig : sideband ] shows the invariant mass distribution for the different trigger types .     the invariant mass distributions from mb ( left ) and hec ( right ) trigger data .",
    "the asymmetry , @xmath0 , is calculated in three different regions : the eta meson peak region ( red ) , as well as the sideband regions ( blue).,title=\"fig : \" ] the invariant mass distributions from mb ( left ) and hec ( right ) trigger data .",

    "[ fig : sideband ] show a clear eta meson peak in the region of the eta meson mass of 0.548 gev/@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "however , there remains a large combinatorial background under the eta meson peak .",
    "this background is corrected for in the final @xmath0 calculation , using the formula : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fraction of background in the eta meson peak region , @xmath35 is the asymmetry in the eta meson mass region , and @xmath36 is the asymmetry of the background , which is the weighted mean of the asymmetries in low and high invariant mass sideband regions relative to the eta meson mass peak , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
