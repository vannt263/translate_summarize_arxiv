    "classified as of?p nearly half a century ago @xcite , hd191612  regained interest only a decade ago when large variations of its line profiles were identified @xcite . as in hd108 , another of?p star @xcite , strong narrow emissions , especially in h , hei lines , practically disappear at certain times . a photometric period of @xmath2537d",
    "was then identified for hd191612 , thanks to hipparcos photometry @xcite , and it was readily shown to be consistent with the spectroscopic changes @xcite .",
    "moreover , variations of the x - ray flux @xcite and uv line profiles @xcite were detected , and found to occur in phase with those in the visible range .",
    "finally , hd191612  became the second o - star with a detected ( strong ) magnetic field @xcite .",
    "currently , there are about a dozen known o stars with detectable global magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the field detection appeared as a key to understand the star s peculiarities .",
    "indeed , such a strong magnetic field is able to channel the stellar winds from opposite hemispheres towards the equatorial regions , forming a disk - like feature .",
    "this slow - moving , dense material generates narrow emissions in the visible range ( notably in h , hei lines ) .",
    "the variations detected at optical wavelengths could be closely reproduced with magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models simply by changing the angle - of - view on the confined winds @xcite .",
    "indeed , when the rotation and magnetic axes are not aligned , our view towards these magnetically - confined winds changes with time .",
    "this can also explain the behavior in uv as confined winds seen edge - on are able to produce the larger absorption at low velocities seen in the uv profiles @xcite .",
    "finally , the collision between the wind flows is able to produce multi - million degree plasma , generating x - ray emission @xcite . depending on geometry ,",
    "some occultation may occur as the stellar body comes into the line - of - sight towards the confined winds at some ( rotational ) phases .",
    "while improvements in our understanding of confined winds have been tremendous in the last decade , several aspects remain to be explained .",
    "to further gain insight on the hottest plasma in magnetospheres , high - resolution x - ray spectra with different angles - of - view on the magnetosphere are needed .",
    "few strongly magnetic o - stars can be studied this way , however .",
    "most objects ( e.g. ngc1624 - 2 @xcite , cpd 28@xmath32561 @xcite , hd57682 @xcite , tr16 - 22 @xcite ) are much too faint for such an endeavor , while others have more practical problems - e.g. the long period ( about 55yrs , @xcite ) of hd108 prohibits a study of its variability over the lifetime of x - ray satellite missions .",
    "currently , a high - resolution spectral analysis of confined winds is thus possible only for three stars : @xmath4oric , hd191612 , and hd148937 .",
    "the latter object , discussed in @xcite , has a constant x - ray emission , linked to a quasi unchanged view of its magnetosphere ( always seen near pole - on ) which limits the available information .",
    "high - resolution spectral analysis of the o star @xmath4oric is also available ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that ` magnetically confined wind shock ' ( mcws ) paradigm @xcite was clearly at work even in an o star .",
    "however , their analysis was based on , although fully self - consistent , 2d mhd simulations which naturally impose an artificial azimuthal symmetry .",
    "furthermore , they compared their numerical models to the observational data only _ indirectly _ : for example , temperatures and line widths derived from xspec fits were confronted to values independently estimated from simulation outputs  the numerical model itself was never directly fitted to the observational data to judge its adequacy .",
    "work here reflects further improvements in several aspects .",
    "a _ chandra _",
    "monitoring of hd191612  at high - resolution allows us to see the hottest magnetospheric component under different angles , leading to precise observational constraints of its properties .",
    "we present the first fully self - consistent 3d mhd model of hd191612 . relying on the dynamical output of this numerical model",
    ", we use a dedicated xspec model to make a _ direct _ comparison between the theory and observations .    in the next section",
    ", we present the observations and their reduction .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of our 3d mhd model .",
    "we then present the results , including the direct comparison between the observations and our models , in  4 , and we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of hd191612  was acquired with _",
    "chandra_-hetg at two key phases , the maximum and minimum emission phases .",
    "these phases correspond to specific angles - of - view onto the confined winds .",
    "indeed , @xcite derived @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 the inclination angle and @xmath7 the obliquity of the magnetic axis relative to the rotation axis ) , while @xcite showed that @xmath8 yielded the best fit to the variations in the strength of h@xmath9 emission component .",
    "thus , the maximum emission phase corresponds to a pole - on view of hd191612 , with confined winds seen face - on , while minimum emission corresponds to an equatorial view , with confined winds disk - like structure seen edge - on .",
    "the maximum was covered by four exposures in may - july 2015 totaling 142ks , while the observation at minimum was split over 6 exposures in early 2016 totaling 196ks ( table [ journal ] ) .",
    "the heg ( resp .",
    "meg ) count rates are 0.0061 ( resp .",
    "0.014 ) ctss@xmath10 at maximum and 0.0046 ( resp .",
    "0.0095 ) ctss@xmath10 at minimum : the different exposure times thus allow us to have data of similar quality ( with @xmath11 and 2000 cts for heg and meg , respectively ) at both phases , facilitating comparisons .",
    "the data were processed using ciao v4.8 and caldb v4.7.0 .",
    "after the initial pipeline processing ( task chandra_repro ) , the high - resolution spectra of each set were combined using the task combine_grating_spectra , also adding + 1 and @xmath12 orders .",
    "in addition , for each exposure , the 0th order spectrum was extracted in a circle of radius 10px ( corresponding to 5  ) around the simbad position of the target while the associated background was evaluated in the surrounding annulus with an outer radius of 30px .",
    "dedicated response matrices were calculated using the task specextract .",
    "the spectra and matrices were then combined using the task combine_spectra to get a single spectrum for maximum and one for minimum . at the maximum emission phase ,",
    "the count rate of the 0th order spectrum amounts to 0.014ctss@xmath10 , whereas it is 0.0095ctss@xmath10 at minimum .",
    "further spectral analysis was performed within xspec v12.9.0i .",
    "note that , for broad - band fitting , all spectra were grouped to reach a minimum of 10 counts per bin .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a second step , we fitted the _",
    "chandra _",
    "high - resolution spectra , allowing for non - solar abundance in the elements whose lines are clearly seen in the heg / meg spectra ( i.e. , ne , mg , si , s , fe ) . note that , for this exercise , the high - resolution spectra were binned in a similar way as the lower - resolution ones ( see end of  2 ) .",
    "furthermore , to avoid the uv - depopulating effects modifying the @xmath18 ratios which are not considered in @xmath19 , the @xmath20 and @xmath6 lines of he - like triplets were grouped in a single bin . as the instrumental broadening of heg / meg spectra is much smaller than for low - resolution data , an intrinsic broadening can be more easily detected .",
    "therefore , we tested several hypotheses : ( 1 ) no intrinsic broadening , ( 2 ) gaussian broadening ( whose amplitude was let free to vary ) , and ( 3 ) simulated line profiles ( fig .",
    "[ modelline ] ) .",
    "the latter scenario allows us to perform a fully coherent comparison between data and 3d mhd simulations , as it uses the complete physical picture ( simulated distribution of emissivity as a function of temperature _ and _ velocity ) provided by the model .",
    "results of these fits are provided in table [ demtable ] and shown for the best lines in fig .",
    "[ demcompa2 ] .",
    "the scaling factors are similar to those found on lower - resolution spectra ( indeed , a global fit to all _ chandra _  spectra also yields similar results ) .",
    "derived abundances are quasi solar : indeed , the solar abundance is within 12@xmath1 of the fitted value for ne , mg , si , and s or within 3@xmath1 for fe .",
    "besides , letting them freely vary only allows to ( slightly ) improve the @xmath21 ( e.g. from 0.36 to 0.29 for the gaussian broadening case ) .",
    "the fitting results thus show no clear and definitive evidence for non - solar abundances for these elements .",
    "a comparison between the different broadening hypotheses is more interesting .",
    "even if the differences are marginal , note that the worst @xmath21 is obtained for no broadening , and the best one for gaussian broadening .",
    "the fwhms in this case are twice smaller than found on individual line analysis ( but this remains within the errors , see sect .",
    "4.1 ) and , as in that analysis , the derived gaussian broadening is again slightly larger at minimum emission phase , though the difference is marginal ( within 2@xmath1 ) .",
    "the best - fit gaussian broadening has a larger value than measured in the simulated profiles ( see end of  .",
    "4.1 and fig .",
    "[ modelline2 ] ) .",
    "this certainly indicates that the observed x - ray lines are broader than expected , as already derived from the line - by - line analysis .",
    "yet , the very good agreement between observations and model predictions and the very limited improvement when considering a larger broadening are remarkable , showing that only further refinements of the model are still needed .",
    "we have obtained _ chandra _  data of the magnetic of?p star hd191612  at two crucial phases ( maximum and minimum emissions , when confined winds are seen face - on and edge - on , respectively ) .",
    "these new data show great similarities with _ -newton_-epic spectra ( i.e. 40% flux decrease and spectrum softening at minimum ) , demonstrating the quasi - perfect repeatability of the x - ray behavior over a decade .",
    "the high - resolution data further reveal more detail , with many similarities with hd148937 and @xmath4oric , the only two other magnetic o - stars observed at high - resolution : small ( but non - zero ) line broadenings for high - z elements , negligible line shifts , hot plasma located at a few stellar radii from the star .",
    "in addition , comparing spectra of hd191612  at the two phases yields no significant change except for flux - the slightly larger broadening and slightly lower line shift found at minimum phase are only marginal , 1@xmath1 changes , thus requiring confirmation with future x - ray facilities such as _ athena - xifu_.    we further compared the observational results with predictions from a dedicated 3d mhd simulation of confined winds in hd191612 .",
    "to this aim the simulated dem was _ directly _ fitted to the observed spectra .",
    "the low - resolution data appear well fitted up to @xmath23kev , a slight overprediction is seen at higher energies which can possibly be mitigated by including inverse compton cooling in future models . at high - resolution , the x - rays lines also appear quite well fitted by the model , though a larger broadening yields slightly better results .",
    "a scaling of the total predicted flux by a factor of @xmath25 is needed but this can be addressed by some reduction of the mass - loss rates , probably due to clumping of the wind .",
    "refinements in the modeling are certainly needed , but the remarkable agreement between data and model certainly shows that the basic picture is promising .",
    "one avenue to investigate may be linked to asymmetries .",
    "indeed , occultation of an axisymmetric equatorial structure located at the position of the x - ray emitting plasma can not explain the observed flux variation of 40% , while an asymmetric distribution , linked e.g. to a magnetic geometry more complicated than a simple centered dipole , may well do so .",
