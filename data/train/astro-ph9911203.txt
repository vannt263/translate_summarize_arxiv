    "the metallicity of a cluster seems to be correlated with the presence of a cooling flow . in this",

    "odea , baum , maloney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) searched for molecular gas , by looking for @xmath2 emission lines in a heterogeneous sample of cooling flow clusters .",
    "they come to the conclusion that in order to have escaped detection the gas has to be very cold , close to the temperature of the cosmic background radiation . + the aim of this contribution is to discuss the minimum temperature achievable by sub - clouds ( resulting from the fragmentation of bigger clouds ) in cooling flow regions by improving the analysis done by odea , baum , maloney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , in particular by considering clouds made of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 molecules and by computing cooling functions which are more appropriate for temperatures below 20 k.",
    "in the standard big bang model primordial chemistry took place around the epoch of recombination . at this stage",
    "the chemical species were essentially hydrogen , deuterium , helium and lithium . then with the adiabatic cooling of the universe due to the expansion , different routes led to molecular formation ( puy et al .",
    "molecules play an important role in the cooling of the denser clouds via the excitation of rotational levels . + in order to calculate analytically the molecular cooling , puy , grenacher and jetzer ( 1999 ) consider only the transition between the ground state and the first rotational level for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . as expected , it turns out that @xmath2 is the main coolant at low temperatures below 20 k. + the clouds are embedded in the hot intracluster gas , whose emission is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "we introduce an attenuating factor @xmath3 characterizing the column density surrounding the sub - clouds .",
    "the attenuated bremsstrahlung flux coming from the intracluster gas heats the clouds located in the cooling flow at a distance @xmath4 from the cluster center .",
    "+ thermal balance between heating and cooling defines an equilibrium temperature of the sub - clouds at a distance @xmath4 inside the cooling region : @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the cooling radius ) .",
    "+ as an example we choose pks 0745 - 191 which is embedded in one of the largest known cooling flows . we adopt the following column densities for a typical small cloud : @xmath7 @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xmath8 with @xmath10 @xmath11 ( density of @xmath0 ) .",
    "these values correspond to a size for the cloud of @xmath12 pc , moreover we take the following abundance @xmath13 .",
    "+ the first column of the following table gives the minimum temperature of the sub - clouds , @xmath14 , inside the cooling flow region for different values of @xmath3 with @xmath15 , whereas the second column gives @xmath14 for different values of @xmath16 with @xmath17 ."
