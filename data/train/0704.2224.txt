    "chern - simons ( cs ) theories are relevant in a quantum field theory context since they provide an alternative gauge - invariant procedure of mass generation @xcite . moreover , the high - temperature limit of quantum field theories in @xmath6 dimensions are effectively three dimensional and cs terms are precisely induced by fermions in @xmath7 dimensions through the parity anomaly @xcite .",
    "cs actions play also a role in the analysis of interesting condensed matter phenomena @xcite-@xcite , the computation of topological invariants of 3-manifolds @xcite and they are connected with @xmath8 conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "cs - higgs models differ drastically from theories in which solely a maxwell or yang - mills term governs the dynamics of the gauge fields .",
    "in particular , at the classical level , axially symmetric ( vortex or string ) solutions to the equations of motion necessarily carry electric charge @xcite-@xcite which , in the non - abelian case , is quantized ( for a complete review on cs theories and planar physics see @xcite ) .",
    "bogomolny equations for the non - abelian cs - higgs system were first obtained in @xcite , where it was shown that , as in the abelian case @xcite-@xcite , a sixth order potential has to be considered .",
    "explicit vortex solutions were exhibited in @xcite , with the flux directed in the cartan subalgebra of the non - abelian group .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to find genuine non - abelian vortex configurations by proposing a more general ansatz as the one already considered for yang - mills - matter theories @xcite-@xcite with gauge group @xmath1 and @xmath9 flavors of fundamental matter multiplets .",
    "the resulting vortex configurations can be characterized by non - abelian collective coordinates related to orientational degrees of freedom and , when @xmath4 , to infinitesimal variations of the transverse size .",

    "in this section we investigate the so - called `` local @xmath35 string - type solutions '' as discussed for the yang - mills case in @xcite-@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we set @xmath5 so the matter fields can be arranged as a square matrix @xmath36 .",

    "we start from the trivial vacuum in the asymmetric phase @xmath41 after a @xmath1 gauge transformation we obtain a singular vortex configuration which , for the scalar field , takes the form @xmath42 with @xmath43 concerning the gauge fields we have @xmath44 in such configuration , the @xmath35 center of the gauge group @xmath21 has been combined with @xmath45 elements to get a topologically stable string solution possessing both windings , in @xmath21 and in @xmath45 ( since @xmath46 , the topology is nontrivial ) .",

    "the boundary conditions for the fields are @xmath51 where we required the solution to be singled - valued at the origin , and to be a pure gauge at infinity . with this ansatz both the flux and the energy of these solutions",

    "composite strings can be constructed by introducing windings in several diagonal elements in the scalar field and can be seen as the superposition of elementary ones .",

    "the energy takes the form @xmath61 the magnetic field ( which is a pseudoscalar in 2 + 1 dimensions ) and the electric field ( with component only in the radial direction ) take the form @xmath62 let us study the solutions of equations ( [ non1])-([non6 ] ) .",
    "we can distinguish two cases : first , when the @xmath45 and @xmath21 coupling constants are equal and then the effective symmetry group is @xmath63 , and second , when the @xmath45 and @xmath21 coupling constants are different .",
    "if the @xmath45 and @xmath21 coupling constants are equal @xmath65 , the system of equations ( [ non1])-([non6 ] ) decouples into @xmath66 where we have defined @xmath67 in terms of the new functions , the boundary conditions are @xmath68 since the field @xmath69 has no winding , it does not necessarily vanish at the origin so @xmath70 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "systems ( [ trivial ] ) and ( [ nontrivial ] ) are formally the same but the functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 obey different boundary conditions . remarkably , both systems coincide with those arising in the abelian case discussed in @xcite . for the pair @xmath71 ,",
    "boundary conditions imply that @xmath73 the system ( [ nontrivial ] ) for the functions @xmath72 was solved numerically in @xcite .",
    "we remark that these equations do not depend on @xmath74 . at the origin , @xmath75 approaches to zero as @xmath76 ( this fact will be important for the semi - local vortex ) .",

    "as usually happens in cs theories , the sixth order potential makes the maximum of the magnetic field to be away from the origin .      when @xmath83 , the complete set of equations ( [ non1])-([non6 ] ) has to be solved numerically .",
    "we used a relaxation method to find explicit numerical solutions .",
    "the ratio of coupling constants @xmath84 is in fact the only independent parameter of the theory , since @xmath85 or @xmath86 can be absorbed by a rescaling .",
    "in fact the energy can be expressed in terms of @xmath87 only .",
    "we observe that as @xmath87 departs from @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 tend to separate from each other as well , forcing @xmath69 to be non - constant . as @xmath87 goes from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , the difference @xmath93 changes sign , forcing the derivative of @xmath69 to change sign .",
    "qualitatively , the behavior resembles the @xmath63 case ( in which both coupling constant coincide ) .",
    "when varying the winding number @xmath53 of the vortex , the profile functions change in a similar way as they do in the @xmath63 case .",
    "for equal @xmath53 and different @xmath74 , solutions do not change considerably .",
    "we present in figure [ kk05 ] some solutions for the case @xmath94 .",
    "we have discussed non - abelian vortex solutions in a @xmath95 theory which are usually called _ local _ vortex solutions . in order to have _ semilocal _ vortex solutions , those for which @xmath96 , one has to extend the matter content of the theory by adding @xmath97 extra flavors so that @xmath98 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for definiteness we take @xmath97 equal to @xmath74 ( but a general case can be equally treated ) .",
    "then , the symmetry of the model is @xmath99 .",
    "we call @xmath100 the extra matter fields .    in this case",
    "the trivial vacuum state is given by @xmath101 and it is invariant under the following transformation @xmath102 where we have chosen , as in the local case , a gauge element @xmath103 with @xmath104 a @xmath105 flavor block and we have called @xmath106 the @xmath105 flavor block acting on the extra @xmath100 mater fields .    we follow now the same steps as in the local case : first we perform a rotation of the vacuum to find a singular vortex configuration and then propose an ansatz for a regular configuration which we write explicitly @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the @xmath105 identity matrix .",
    "it should be stressed that more general ansatz could lead to solutions which exhaust the number @xmath109 of collective coordinates related to the transverse moduli space @xcite .",
    "our ansatz corresponds to just two collective coordinates .    substituting ( [ ansatzchi ] ) into the bogomolny equations , we arrive to a system of six differential equations for the fields @xmath69 , @xmath75 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath89 and @xmath112 , and two constraints for the fields @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the solutions to these equations will have the same energy and flux than the local ones ( [ flux - energy ] ) , provided they satisfy the same boundary conditions ( [ boundcond ] ) . at infinity",
    "the solutions should reach the vacuum state , so we impose @xmath113 @xmath114 again we distinguish the case in which the @xmath45 and @xmath21 gauge coupling constants are equal from the one in which they are different .      as it happens for local vortex , when @xmath116 the equations of motion decouple into two sets of independent equations .",
    "one corresponds to a system with no winding @xmath117 and the other corresponds to a system with winding @xmath53 @xmath118 ( we have defined @xmath119 and @xmath120 as in ( [ nontrivial2 ] ) ) . as in the case of local strings ,",
    "these equations coincide with those that arise in the abelian case @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ semitrivial ] ) admits a trivial solution @xmath121 while ( [ seminontrivial ] ) can be solved numerically . combining the equations for @xmath111 and @xmath75",
    ", we get @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a ( complex ) integration constant .",
    "so , we finally have @xmath124 the same argument applied to @xmath110 and @xmath69 determines that @xmath125 , but since @xmath126 and @xmath127 , @xmath128 must vanish , and so @xmath129 everywhere .",
    "the solutions we obtain are then the most general ones .",
    "the energy is independent of the complex parameter @xmath123 , which is then associated with the `` size moduli '' .",
    "one has has in general , @xmath130 complex parameters @xmath131 for arbitrary flavor @xmath96 . for elementary strings one can see that @xmath132 ( since we are considering @xmath133 , we have in this case just one complex parameter ) .    from figure [ semikk1 - 2 ]",
    "we see that the solutions spread when the parameter @xmath134 is incremented . as @xmath123 increases , since the flux is conserved , the extremum of the magnetic field must approach to the origin to compensate the spread towards spatial infinity .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs with the energy .",
    "we consider now the case in which @xmath136 .",
    "the same arguments as above lead to @xmath137 , so that the flavor group is in fact reduced from @xmath138 to @xmath139 .",
    "similarly , the relation holds , and the differential equations do not decouple .",
    "the system is very analogous to the system ( [ non1])-([non6 ] ) obtained for the local case , with the only difference that , in the equations for the @xmath89 s , the field @xmath75 gets locally scaled @xmath140 then , semi - local solutions arising from these equations are similar to those shown in figure [ kk05 ] for the local case , with the only difference that they are smoother since they decay as powers of @xmath141 at spatial infinity .      in summary , our main task in this work was to solve the bps equations for a non - abelian chern - simons - higgs theory . by proposing an axially symmetric ansatz we obtained non - abelian vortex solutions and discussed their properties . a class of vortex solutions in non - abelian cs theories were already known @xcite-@xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the solutions discussed here correspond to more fundamental vortices in the sense that they are genuinely non - abelian while the former correspond to @xmath35 vortices with the gauge flux in the cartan algebra of @xmath21 ) .",
    "the model discussed here is indeed related to the one analyzed by @xcite-@xcite except that in our case the dynamics of the gauge fields is governed by a cs action instead of a yang - mills one .",
    "this drastically changes the vortex properties , in particular forcing them to carry electric charge .    in the case of local vortices ,",
    "our solutions generalize those discussed in @xcite to the case in which the gauge group is @xmath1 , with the abelian and non - abelian sectors having different gauge coupling constants .",
    "when both couplings are equal , the equations decouple into two sets of equations that coincide with those arising in the abelian case .",
    "this is not the case when the couplings are different and the bps equations do not decouple .",
    "nevertheless we were able to construct explicit solutions and discuss their properties .",
    "further , we have also considered semi - local vortices , by allowing the flavor number @xmath2 to be larger than the color number @xmath142 . as already noted for the yang - mills - higgs system ,",
    "the main feature in this case is that the solutions develop an additional moduli @xmath123 related to the vortex transverse size , thus modifying the asymptotic behavior of the fields , from exponential decay for the case of local vortices , to a decay as negative power of the radial coordinate for the semi - local ones .",
    "interestingly enough , one can see from our explicit solutions how the size of the vortex grows with @xmath123 .",
