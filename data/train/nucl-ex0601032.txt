    "the existence of exotic baryons such as pentaquark and dibaryon has been suggested theoretically , because qcd requires only that hadrons should be color singlet , but does not restrict the number of quarks @xcite .",
    "although many experimental efforts to search for these exotics were made , there was no clear evidence .",
    "it was about 30 years later from the establishment of qcd that the first report about the exotic pentaquark , which is now called @xmath0 , was made by spring-8/leps collaboration @xcite .",
    "they showed a peak in mass distribution of @xmath15 system via @xmath16 reaction where neutrons in @xmath17c nuclei were used as a target .",

    "many other theoretical studies such as constituent quark model , qcd sum rules and lattice qcd were devoted to @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "was not observed and the upper limit of production cross section via @xmath20 reaction was set to be 0.8 nb .",
    "these negative results make the existence of @xmath0 be in more puzzling situation .",
    "however titov et al . , using quark constituent coupling rules , shows that the production of the @xmath0 is suppressed relative to the @xmath21 resonance by about three orders of magnitude for high energy experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to confirm the existence of @xmath0 , high statistics experiments at low energy region with hadronic reaction become crucial .",
