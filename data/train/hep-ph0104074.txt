    "theories with extra dimensions have received tremendous attention within the last a few years .",
    "one of the most interesting incarnations was formulated by randall and sundrum ( rs1 ) @xcite , who postulated a universe with two 4-d surfaces ( `` branes '' ) bounding a slice of 5-d ads spacetime .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) fields are assumed to be located on one brane ( the `` tev brane '' ) .",
    "gravity lives on the other brane ( the `` planck brane '' ) and in the bulk as well as the tev brane .",
    "both branes have equal but opposite tension , while the bulk has a ( negative ) cosmological constant . by carefully tuning the brane tensions against the bulk cosmological constant",

    "the extra dimension is assumed to be compactified on a @xmath5 orbifold . ]",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the size of the extra dimension and @xmath8 .",
    "all mass scales in the full 5-d theory are of order the planck scale . by placing the sm fields at @xmath9",
    ", all mass terms must be rescaled by an exponential suppression factor ( `` warp factor '' ) @xmath10 that can bring them down to the tev scale .",
    "this merely requires that @xmath11 , and thus roughly @xmath12 times the fundamental planck length . this is a dramatic improvement over the original hierarchy problem between the electroweak scale and the 4-d planck scale @xmath13 .",
    "the first obvious difficulty with this scenario is to arrange that the extra dimension stabilizes to a size of about an order of magnitude larger than the planck length . in the original proposal ,",
    "the potential for the size of the extra dimension is flat , so that all sizes are classically equivalent .",
    "the actual size of the extra dimension was tuned appropriately to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "a more serious concern was first identified by ref .",
    "@xcite , in which enforcing @xmath14 in a cosmological context implied a nontrivial relationship between the tev and planck brane energy densities .",
    "ultimately this was shown to be a direct result of assuming the potential for the size of the extra dimension is flat .",
    "hence , the scalar field associated with fluctuations of the size of the extra dimension , the `` radion '' , is massless .",
    "if , on the other hand , _ bulk _ dynamics setup a potential whose minimum determined the distance separating the two branes , then the radion acquires a mass .",
    "goldberger and wise ( gw ) @xcite noticed that a potential could be setup for the radion , by adding a 5-d bulk scalar to rs1 arranged so that it acquires an @xmath15-dependent vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "furthermore , the classical potential is stable against quantum corrections @xcite . in their analysis ,",
    "the 5-d metric was generalized to @xmath16 where @xmath7 has a vev and an @xmath17-dependent fluctuation .",
    "this generalization with radial fluctuations , however , does not satisfy einstein s equations , and so a different ansatz for the metric is needed to calculate the mass and couplings of the radion .",
    "charmousis , gregory , and rubakov @xcite proposed the metric @xmath18 in which they showed that a consistent treatment of the radial fluctuations characterized by the scalar field @xmath19 is possible while solving the linearized einstein equations .",
    "( in the randall - sundrum model , @xmath20 . )",
    "this analysis , however , did not take into account the effect of the bulk scalar field back onto the metric ( the `` back - reaction '' ) . including the back - reaction of the bulk scalar field on the metric is in general highly nontrivial . however , dewolfe , freedman , gubser , and karch @xcite proposed an interesting generating solution technique motivated from gauged supergravity .",
    "their technique allows one to calculate the potential for the size of the extra dimension consistently including the effects of the bulk scalar field vev profile into the metric .",
    "this manifested itself through additional @xmath15-dependent terms in @xmath21 .",
    "however , radial fluctuations were not considered .",
    "this motivated the work by cski , graesser , and kribs @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that used the generating solution technique by dewolfe et al .",
    "@xcite , combined with the cgr metric ansatz @xcite , to show that a consistent treatment of the fluctuations in the size of the extra dimension could be done . in this work , the wave - function , mass , and couplings of the radion were explicitly calculated .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the mass of radion is of order tev/35 , multiplied by the size of the back - reaction ( taken as a perturbation ) .",
    "remarkably , this closely matched the radion mass calculation in refs .",
    "@xcite , that used the `` naive '' ansatz in eq .",

    "the radion couplings could be obtained through @xmath22 and thus couples to the trace of the energy momentum tensor @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the canonically normalized radion field , related to @xmath19 via @xcite @xmath25 the strength of the radion couplings are proportional to the inverse `` warped '' planck scale , and thus for appropriate choice of @xmath7 , the tev scale .",
    "one of the new results of this analysis is that the kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the bulk scalar field couple to the sm fields , albeit suppressed by the size of the back - reaction divided by the kk mass ( of order the warped planck scale ) .    with a radion mass that is of order the weak scale , and couplings that are of order 1/tev",
    ", several groups proceeded to analyze the phenomenology of the radion @xcite .",
    "it was quickly realized that the radion couplings are analogous to the higgs at tree - level .",
    "( at one loop , the radion couples to the trace anomaly @xcite , and therefore has a significantly different coupling to , for example , massless gauge bosons . )",
    "in particular , the tree - level couplings of the radion to the electroweak gauge bosons are the same as those of the sm higgs , upon substituting @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the higgs and radion mass eigenstates , @xmath28 gev is the electroweak vev , and the warped planck scale is @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we will use `` tev brane cutoff scale '' or just `` cutoff scale '' to refer to the warped planck scale , since our 4-d effectively theory is valid only up to about @xmath30 .",
    "this leads to new contributions to the electroweak precision observables , such as the oblique corrections @xcite . generally , the size of this effect is rather small , since for a cutoff scale of order a tev , @xmath31 is order @xmath32 . for much lower cutoff scales ,",
    "direct kk graviton production is important , and can provide constraints on the rs1 scenario @xcite .",
    "since the radion couplings to the sm are similar to those of the higgs boson , it is natural to ask if the radion has any significant effects on the electroweak symmetry breaking sector , especially in the pessimistic scenario where the sm higgs is rather heavy and may not be easily produced at collider experiments . in this paper",
    "we consider the effects of the radion on perturbative unitarity bounds in the sm .",
    "a few papers @xcite have considered some of the effects of the radion on unitarity involving external higgs bosons , although no explicit description of the goldstone boson equivalence theorem is present , nor the effects of including curvature - higgs mixing .",

    "[ conclusions - sec ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in the sm , the longitudinal components of the electroweak gauge bosons ( @xmath37 ) arise from the eaten goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry . the study of scattering of longitudinally polarized gauge bosons would thus be the most direct means to explore the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking . in this section ,",
