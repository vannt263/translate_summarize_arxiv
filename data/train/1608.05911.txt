    "the c15 laves phase compound cefe@xmath2 is known to be an unstable ferromagnet with the existence of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin fluctuations in ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state .",
    "@xcite this instability has been extensively studied with the help of impurity substitutions at the fe site .",
    "a very small amount ( @xmath8 5 @xmath9 ) of certain impurities , specifically co , ru , ir , al , os , re , ga , si , is known to cause a total loss of ferromagnetism at temperatures lower than the cefe@xmath2 curie temperature ( t@xmath10 230 k ) .",
    "@xcite this second , fm - afm , transition has been reported to be of first - order nature .",
    "@xcite for certain other impurities , viz .",
    ", mn , ni , cu , rh , pd , and pt , however , no such additional magnetic phase transition occurs .",
    "@xcite various experimental tools have been employed to know the true magnetic state of ce sub - lattice and the instabilities related to the fe sub - lattice .",
    "theories in the literature suggest that the instability of the fm state arises through a competition between the ferromagnetic fe 3__d__-fe 3__d _ _ interaction , and the antiferromagnetic interaction due to the ce 4@xmath0 - ce 5@xmath1 - fe 3@xmath1 hybridization .",
    "@xcite    it is quite intriguing to find a possible connection between the occurrence or non - occurrence , and the composition - dependent behaviour of the second transition ( if present ) , on the one hand , and the strengths of the @xmath11 interaction and @xmath3 hybridization on the other .",
    "there exists one experimental report by chaboy _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite wherein they study the @xmath3 hybridizations in ce(fe@xmath5co@xmath6)@xmath2 using ce l@xmath12- , fe k- and co k - edge x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and x - ray magnetic circular dichroism .",
    "they , however , address a different issue .",
    "they correlate an anomalous magnetic behavior of ce(fe@xmath5co@xmath6)@xmath2 , best understandable as the non - linear ( somewhat oscillatory ) @xmath7-dependence of the t@xmath13 , with the ce valence and the @xmath3 hybridization , and found that neither of the two is responsible for the anomaly .",
    "the behaviour of the second transition was not looked at in the report . in a step forward in this direction , we recently reported an extensive systematic computational investigation of the behaviour of the @xmath3 hybridization in representative ce(fe@xmath14m@xmath15)@xmath16 compounds across 3__d _ _ , 4__d _ _",
    ", 5__d _ _ and post - transition impurity series .",
    "@xcite the relevant outcome of this computational study has been that the @xmath3 hybridization is the strongest for the mn group impurity in the period , and gets weakened on either side of it .",
    "another consideration which possibly could help one seek the origin of the occurrence or non - occurrence of the impurity - induced second transition could be the crystal structure of the end - compound cem@xmath2 , along with the solid solubility of m in cefe@xmath2 .",
    "a survey of the literature cited above reveals that out of the existing second transition inducing impurities , al , co , ru , os and ir possess the same cubic laves phase structure ( space group 277 ) as cefe@xmath2 , while cesi@xmath2 ( space group 141 ) and cega@xmath2 ( space group 191 ) are of different lattice structures , and cere@xmath2 does not even exist thermodynamically . among the impurities not causing the second transition also , some of the end - compounds ( ceni@xmath2 , cerh@xmath2 and cept@xmath2 ) are isostructural with cefe@xmath2 and some different ( cecu@xmath2 - space group 74 ; cesb@xmath2 - space group 64 ) .",
    "so , the crystal structure of the end - compound cem@xmath2 has no correlation with the second transition .",
    "nevertheless , we have chosen three impurities cr , ag and au such that either there exists no cem@xmath2 end - compound ( cecr@xmath2 ) thermodynamically or , if it exists , it is not a laves phase ( ceag@xmath2 , ceau@xmath2 : space group 74 ) compound . from the computation point of view , @xcite the @xmath3 hybridization in these pseudobinaries are supposed to be weaker than that in cefe@xmath2 .",
    "these impurities have hitherto not been studied .",
    "the present work , thus , comprises of a two - fold objective : ( i ) to explore the occurrence and behavior of the second transition in pseudobinaries ce(fe@xmath5m@xmath6)@xmath2 with unexplored impurities cr , ag and au , and ( ii ) to seek any correlation between the behavior of the second transition and the @xmath3 hybridization . in the following",
    "we will show that for ag and au impurities , although the hybridization as calculated using xas decreases in agreement with the theoretically predicted behaviour , there is no second phase transition . in the case of ce(fe@xmath5cr@xmath6)@xmath2",
    ", however , the second ( fm - afm ) transition exists , and the @xmath3 hybridization nicely follows the concentration dependence of the fm - afm transition temperature .",

    "the samples were further analysed by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) at room temperature using a phi 5000 versa probe ii system .",
    "the xps data were recorded under ultra - high vacuum condition with a base pressure of @xmath23 mbar using an al - k@xmath22 source , a hemispherical analyser and a multichannel detector . in order to reduce the surface effects ,",
    "clean sample surfaces were first obtained by cleaving the polycrystals before inserting into the uhv chamber , and then sputtering the surface using ar@xmath24 ions before the data collection .",
