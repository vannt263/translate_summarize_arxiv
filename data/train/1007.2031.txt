    "the study of the structure of hadron resonances is one of the central issues in modern hadron spectroscopy . among others ,",
    "the structure of the @xmath0 meson has been intensively studied , since the @xmath0 meson is considered to play an important role in various aspects of hadron and nuclear physics . for instance , since the scalar - isoscalar excitation of qcd vacuum can be regarded as the amplitude fluctuation of the chiral order parameter @xmath2 , the nature of the @xmath0 meson is crucial to understand the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in qcd  @xcite . while the existence of the scalar - isoscalar resonance in the @xmath1 scattering is established by recent analyses ( see e.g. ref .  ) , its internal structure is still controversial . thus , it is our aim here to investigate the structure of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "there are many proposals for the structure of the @xmath0 meson based on various effective models : collective @xmath3 excitation  @xcite , tetraquark structure with strong diquark correlation  @xcite , dynamically generated @xmath1 resonance  @xcite , and so on .",
    "conventionally , the validity of certain structure has been tested by comparing the model prediction with experimental data , for instance , mass spectrum and the decay properties .",
    "it is also possible to investigate the structure of the resonance from the response to the change of the internal / external parameter of the models .",
    "for instance , the study of the @xmath4 scaling is successful to disentangle the @xmath3 and other structures for meson resonances  @xcite . following this philosophy",
    ", we would like to study the spectral change of the @xmath0 meson when the chiral symmetry is partially restored , in order to discriminate the different internal structures .    in association with chiral symmetry restoration , the softening of the @xmath0 meson has been discussed  @xcite . in the linear realization of chiral symmetry",
    ", the @xmath0 meson forms a chiral four - vector together with the pion , and hence they are chiral partners .",
    "the partial restoration of chiral symmetry induces the softening of the @xmath0 spectrum , which results in the enhancement of the @xmath1 cross section in the scalar - isoscalar channel near threshold .",
    "it was shown later that the threshold enhancement in the @xmath5 channel takes place also in the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry without the bare @xmath0 field  @xcite where the @xmath0 meson is expressed as a dynamically generated resonance from the attractive @xmath1 interaction .",
    "although similar threshold enhancement of the cross section is observed in both cases , the mechanism which causes the softening is quite different .",
    "based on these observations , we demonstrate that the softening phenomena reflects the structure of the @xmath0 meson , paying attention to the nature of the @xmath6-wave resonance .",
    "when the symmetry is completely restored , the chiral partners emerge as the pair of particles with a degenerate mass .",
    "if we regard the mass degeneracy as the condition for the chiral partner , we can extend the notion of the chiral partner for the dynamically generated @xmath0 meson in the nonlinear realization . we will study the structure of the @xmath1 scattering amplitude of our model in the restoration limit , to discuss the chiral partner of the pion .",
    "here we describe the @xmath1 scattering amplitude with the @xmath0 resonance in the @xmath5 channel .",
    "we consider the low energy behavior of the amplitude based on chiral effective lagrangian , and then introduce the unitarity condition to extend the applicability of the model to the resonance energy region .",
    "we start from the lagrangian of two - flavor linear sigma model to derive the @xmath1 scattering amplitudes : @xmath7 ,      \\label{eq : lagrangian } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 . in this lagrangian ,",
    "the @xmath0 meson is treated as the chiral partner of the pion . for negative @xmath9 ,",
    "chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and three parameters in the lagrangian @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are related to the chiral condensate ( pion decay constant ) @xmath13 , the mass of the pion @xmath14 , and the mass of the @xmath0 meson @xmath15 in the mean - field level .    crossing symmetry enables us to express the general @xmath1 scattering amplitude as @xmath16 , where the invariant amplitude @xmath17 is given , from the lagrangian   at tree level , by  @xcite @xmath18 in this expression , the first ( second ) term can be regarded as the leading ( higher ) order contribution in the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the coefficient of the leading order term is fixed by the low energy theorem , while the low energy constant for the higher order terms is not constrained by the symmetry and should be determined by experiments .",
    "thus , we introduce a parameter @xmath19 to express the general amplitude @xmath20 by choosing @xmath21 , we recover the result of the original lagrangian  .",
    "if we take @xmath22 , then we are left with the leading order interaction , which also corresponds to the heavy @xmath15 limit . in this way",
    ", we can smoothly connect the original linear sigma model ( @xmath21 ) and the leading order chiral perturbation theory without the bare @xmath0 field @xmath23 .",
    "projecting eq .   onto the @xmath5 channel",
    ", we obtain the tree - level amplitude for the @xmath1 scattering as @xmath24 ,      \\label{eq : ttree}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "next we consider the unitarity condition @xmath25 for @xmath26 , with the two - body phase space function @xmath27 .",
    "based on the n / d method , we write down the general expression of the unitary scattering amplitude @xmath28 . matching the chiral interaction @xmath29 with the loop expansion of the full amplitude @xmath28",
    ", we obtain the amplitude which is consistent with both chiral low energy theorem and unitarity as  @xcite @xmath30      \\right\\ } \\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the subtraction constant at the subtraction point @xmath10 .",
    "we determine the subtraction constant by excluding the nontrivial cdd pole ( states which does not originate in the two - body dynamics ) in the amplitude  @xcite @xmath32 which leads to @xmath33 . with this subtraction",
    "constant , the full scattering amplitude @xmath34 reduces into the tree level one @xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "the full amplitude @xmath28 corresponds to the nonperturbative resummation of the s - channel loop diagrams up to infinite order . for the @xmath21 case , the bare @xmath0 pole in the lagrangian acquire the finite width through the coupling to the @xmath1 state , and",
    "the full scattering amplitude exhibits a pole in the complex energy plane . on the other hand , for the @xmath22 case without the bare @xmath0 pole ,",
    "a resonance can be dynamically generated as the pole of the amplitude , if the two - body interaction is sufficiently attractive .",
    "indeed , it is shown that the resummation of the leading order interaction generates the @xmath0 meson dynamically  @xcite . in the following",
    "we compare the properties of these @xmath0 states : one originating in the chiral partner of the pion in the linear @xmath0 model ( @xmath21 ) , and another generated dynamically from the attractive @xmath1 interaction ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "now we introduce the effect of chiral symmetry restoration through the modification of the model parameters .",
    "it is known that the chiral condensate should decrease with the chiral symmetry restoration , so we parametrize the condensate by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the condensate in vacuum and we vary the parameter @xmath39 from one to zero to express the symmetry restoration .",
    "the njl model indicates that @xmath14 hardly changes as symmetry restoration  @xcite , so we assume that it is a constant : @xmath40 the bare mass of the @xmath0 should be degenerated with pion when the symmetry is restored .",
    "this can be achieved by the mean - field relation of eq .",
    "@xmath41 with @xmath11 and @xmath14 being fixed .",
    "it is instructive to study the behavior of the @xmath1 scattering amplitude in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "here we analytically derive the pole of the amplitude in the restoration limit . in subsection 4.2",
    ", we will numerically demonstrate that the obtained result corresponds to the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath0 pole for @xmath42 .",
    "we first consider the @xmath21 case , where the @xmath0 meson is the chiral partner of the pion . to make the @xmath43 dependence in @xmath15 explicit , we rewrite the tree level amplitude as @xmath44 the second term represents the bare pole of the @xmath0 meson . as @xmath42 , the pole mass of this term decreases and finally it coincides with the pion mass . because of the renormalization condition",
    ", the tree - level amplitude @xmath45 coincides with the full amplitude @xmath46 at @xmath36 , so the full amplitude @xmath46 also has a pole as in the same way with @xmath45 .",
    "approximating the amplitude by the breit - wigner form around the pole , @xmath47 we extract the mass of the state @xmath48 and the coupling to the scattering state @xmath49 .",
    "in the present case , we find @xmath50 this is what we anticipate for the properties of the chiral partner ; the mass degeneracy with the pion and the vanishing of the coupling constant to the @xmath1 state .",
    "next we consider the @xmath22 case without the bare @xmath0 pole . in this case ,",
    "@xmath43 dependence of the tree - level amplitude   exclusively stems from the overall factor , @xmath51 taking the restoration limit @xmath42 , this term diverges , and therefore the full amplitude is solely determined by the loop function @xmath52 : @xmath53 thus , the pole of the amplitude in the restoration limit is given by the zero of @xmath52 .",
    "the present renormalization scheme requires @xmath54 for @xmath36 , which indicates the existence of a pole at @xmath55 in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath49 can be obtained by calculating the residue of the pole : @xmath56 thus , for the dynamically generated @xmath0 meson , the amplitude has a pole at the pion mass with the coupling constant which is proportional to @xmath14 for @xmath42 .",
    "this result has an interesting implication for the chiral partner . strictly speaking",
    ", the notion of the `` chiral partner '' is defined only in the chiral limit ( @xmath57 ) , where the su(2)@xmath58su(2 ) symmetry is exact in the wigner phase . in the chiral limit ,",
    ".   indicates @xmath59 , so the asymptotic value of the mass and coupling constant of the dynamically generated @xmath0 meson is exactly the same with the chiral partner case .",
    "namely , the dynamically generated @xmath0 meson behaves as if it is the chiral partner of the pion , for @xmath57 .",
    "we first show the description of the scattering amplitude in vacuum . we choose canonical values of the parameters as @xmath60 mev , @xmath61 mev , and @xmath62 mev . by taking the parameter @xmath21",
    ", the @xmath0 meson is described as the chiral partner of the pion ( chiral @xmath0 ) , and we refer to this case as `` model a '' . choosing @xmath22 , we obtain the dynamically generated @xmath0 meson in the amplitude .",
    "this case is called as `` model b '' .    to check the agreement with the physical amplitude , we study the properties of these models without symmetry restoration . we calculate the scattering length @xmath63 ( in units of @xmath64 ) in these models .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tbl : model ] , together with the pole position of the amplitude in the complex energy plane .",
    "we find a qualitative agreement with the recent analyses of experimental data  @xcite , @xmath65 and @xmath66 mev .",
    "[ tbl : model ]      we then study the variation of the scattering amplitude in the @xmath0 channel along with partial restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "we plot the reduced cross section @xmath67 and the trace of the pole position as functions of the total center - of - mass energy @xmath68 , by changing the parameter @xmath39 from 1 to 0 .    the invariant mass spectra and the pole trajectory of model a are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modela ] , where the softening of @xmath0 is clearly observed .",
    "as the symmetry is restored , the @xmath0 pole moves toward the @xmath1 threshold and the spectrum gets narrow and enhanced around threshold . in this case , since the @xmath0 meson is treated as the chiral partner of pion , the softening phenomena is driven by the decrease of the bare mass of the @xmath0 and its consequence of the reduction of the phase space for the decay  @xcite . in the limit @xmath42 , the pole approaches the mass of the pion , as indicated by the analysis in section  [ subsec : limit ] .",
    "mass spectra of the @xmath0 meson ( left ) and the trace of the pole positions ( right ) in model a ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the poles on the first ( second ) riemann sheet are plotted by triangles ( crosses ) .",
    "symbols are marked with each 0.1 step of @xmath39 .",

    "[ fig : modelb ] . in this case , although the threshold enhancement takes place , the change of the spectrum as well as the trace of the pole are qualitatively different from those of model a. especially , the pole in the complex energy plane goes to the subthreshold energy region , keeping the width finite .",
    "this is a peculiar feature of the dynamically generated @xmath0 meson . as a consequence ,",
    "the strong enhancement of the cross section occurs at much later stage of the symmetry restoration , compared with the model a.     mass spectra of the @xmath0 meson ( left ) and the trace of the pole positions ( right ) in model b ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "since the low energy interaction is proportional to @xmath69 , the symmetry restoration effectively increases the attractive interaction .",
    "thus , the dynamically generated @xmath0 resonance will eventually turns into a @xmath1 bound state when the interaction becomes sufficiently attractive . at this stage , however , it is important to recall that the @xmath0 is in @xmath6-wave . in this case ,",
    "when the attraction is increased , the resonance first becomes the _ virtual state _ which is the pole on the second riemann sheet of the energy plane but lies below the threshold  @xcite .",
    "the peculiar pole trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelb ] is due to the appearance of the virtual state .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the finite pion mass is important for the appearance of the virtual state .",
    "if @xmath70 , the @xmath1 threshold lies at @xmath71 , so there is no region where the virtual state appears .",
    "indeed , the virtual state was not seen in the analysis of the dynamically generated @xmath0 meson in ref .",
    ", studied in the chiral limit . in addition , the @xmath6-wave nature of the @xmath0 is also essential for the virtual state",
    ". therefore , the behavior of the @xmath72 meson in @xmath73-wave amplitude will not exhibit such a structure ( see also ref .  ) .    as we further restore the symmetry",
    ", the @xmath0 meson becomes the bound state . in the limit @xmath42",
    ", the pole moves toward the pion mass .",
    "this is again in agreement with the result in section  [ subsec : limit ] : the appearance of the pole at the pion mass in the restoration limit .",
    "we have studied the properties of the @xmath0 meson in the @xmath1 scattering associated with the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "two models are constructed based on chiral low energy interaction and unitarity of the scattering amplitude : one describes the @xmath0 meson as the chiral partner of the pion , and the other treats the @xmath0 meson as dynamically generated resonance .",
    "for the dynamically generated @xmath0 meson , we find the qualitative difference from the chiral partner @xmath0 in the softening behavior , namely , the movement of the pole of the amplitude and its consequence of the change of the spectrum .",
    "the difference stems from the mechanism which drives the softening , and it is the appearance of the virtual state that leads to the distinct behavior of the dynamically generated @xmath0 .",
    "we also study the asymptotic properties of the @xmath0 pole in the restoration limit . for the @xmath0 meson as the chiral partner , we find that the mass of the @xmath0 pole approaches the pion mass and the coupling to the @xmath1 state vanishes .",
    "for the dynamically generated @xmath0 , we also find the mass degeneracy with the pion , and the coupling strength vanishes in the chiral limit @xmath57 .",
    "namely , the behavior of the dynamically generated @xmath0 pole in the restoration limit is essentially the same with what we expect for the chiral partner .",
    "this is a nontrivial result which urge us to speculate the possibility of the dynamically generated @xmath0 meson as the chiral partner of the pion .    in this way , through the comparison of two models , we draw two conclusions : ( i ) with partial restoration of chiral symmetry , the difference of the internal structures is reflected in the spectral change of the @xmath0 channel , and ( ii ) in the symmetry restoration limit , the difference of the structure is reduced and we obtain essentially the same behavior of the @xmath0 pole for @xmath57",
