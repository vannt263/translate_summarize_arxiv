    "in the last decades , since the pioneering works of the 1980 s ( cf . , e.g. , @xcite ) , strong efforts were made in the development of accurate and efficient approximation schemes for convection - dominated flow and transport problems . for a review of fundamental concepts related to their analysis and approximation and a presentation of prominent robust numerical methods we refer to the monograph @xcite .",
    "convection - dominated problems are of high practical interest .",
    "they arise in many branches of technology and , therefore , deservedly attracted substantial analysis .",
    "applications can be found in fluid dynamics including turbulence modeling , electro - magnetism , semi - conductor devices , environmental and civil engineering as well as in chemical and biological scienes .",
    "if transport mechanisms are convection - dominated , solution profiles with sharp moving fronts , interior or boundary layers with complicated structures where important physical and chemical phenomena take place may occur .",
    "the development of numerical methods with the ability to capture the strong gradients of the exact solution without producing spurious oscillations or smearing effects continues to remain a challenging task .    in the recent years",
    "a substantial progress has been made in the numerical approximation of convection - dominated problems , even though a real breakthrough is still missing .",
    "numerous families of stabilization concepts were proposed and studied for various discretization techniques ; cf .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we focus on finite element discretizations along with residual - based stabilizations .",
    "in particular , we use the streamline upwind petrov ",
    "galerkin ( supg ) method for our unsteady computations . for steady problems",
    "an additional shock - capturing stabilization is applied to further enhance the effect of the numerical method that is proposed in this work . restricting ourselves to steady problems in some of our numerical experiments",
    "is done for the sake of simplicity .",
    "it is sufficient for illustrating the method s features we would like to investigate . in the literature shock - capturing stabilization is also often refered to as a spurious oscillations at layers diminishing ( sold ) method .",
    "the supg method reduces non - physical osciallations in streamline direction , whereas sold methods yield an additional stabilization in crosswind direction . for a review of prominent variants of sold methods and a competitive numerical investigation of the performance properties of supg and families of sold stabilizations we refer to , e.g. , @xcite . besides the class of these residual - based stabilization techniques , flux - corrected transport schemes are further addressed in @xcite .",
    "these techniques aim at a stabilization on the algebraic level ; cf .",
    "@xcite . in many works of the literature authors conclude that spurious osciallations in the numerical approximation of convection - dominated problems can be reduced by state - of - the - art stabilization techniques ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) , but nevertheless the results are not satisfactory yet ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , in particular , if applications of practical interest and in three space dimensions are considered .",
    "adaptive mesh generation based on an a posteriori error control is nowadays a well known technique to capture singular phenomena and sharp gradients of solutions to partial differential equations in numerical simulations . for a review of a posteriori error estimation techniques for finite element methods and automatic mesh generation",
    "we refer , for instance , to the monograph @xcite .",
    "even though interior and boundary layers that arise in applications of practical interest can not be resolved completely by adaptive finite element meshes , at least in a reasonable computing time , a further improvement and gain in accuracy may nevertheless be expected by applying the concepts of automatic mesh generation to stabilized finite element approximations of convection - dominated problems .",
    "however , the design of an adaptive method requires the provision of an appropriate a posteriori error estimator .",
    "the derivation such an error estimator for convection - dominated problems , that is robust with respect to the small perturbation parameter of the partial differential equation , is delicious and has borne out to be a considerable source of trouble .",
    "so far , the quality of adaptively refined grids is often not satisfactory yet .",
    "further , only a few contributions have been published yet for convection - dominated problems and the considered type of discretizations .",
    "this observation even holds for stationary problems . for a deeper discussion and further references",
    "we refer to @xcite for the stationary case and to @xcite for evolutionary problems .",
    "usually , existing a posteriori error analyses for convection - dominated problems are either not robust with respect to the small perturbation parameter , embodyed by increasing bounds for a vanishing perturbation parameter , or the a posteriori error estimates are not based on the natural norm of the discretization for that an a priori error analysis becomes feasible .",
    "for the stationary case , in @xcite an a posteriori error bound is presented in the norm @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the small diffusion parameter .",
    "the bound is not robust in @xmath1 . on the other hand , in @xcite the dual norm of the convective derivative",
    "is added to the energy norm to get a robust error estimate with respect to the small diffusion parameter .",
    "an extension of this approach to evolutionary problems is given in @xcite .",
    "for evolutionary problems more recent robust a posteriori estimators measuring the error in a space - time mesh - dependent dual norm can be found in @xcite .",
    "they are based on a space - time equilibrated flux reconstruction and are locally computable .",
    "the estimator by itself is local - in - time and local - in - space and does not depend on dual norms .",
    "however , dual error norms are usually beyond a reasonable physical interpretation and hard to compute such that they are of little interest in applications and difficult to use in studies of the experimental order of convergence .    in @xcite",
    "a robust residual - based a posteriori error estimate in the supg norm is presented for stationary convection - diffusion equations .",
    "its derivation uses variational multiscale theory .",
    "upper and lower bounds are provided where the global upper bound relies on some hypotheses .",
    "a similar situation can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is argumed and demonstrated by numerical experiments that the hypotheses are fulfilled and non restrictive in standard applications .",
    "the a priori error estimate in @xcite is based on different weights than other residual - based error estimators for convection - diffusion - reaction problems .",
    "however it is noted that the estimator performs well if the solution posses only one kind of singularity .",
    "otherwise the non - robust residual - based estimator for the @xmath2 norm should be prefered . in @xcite",
    "an adaptive supg method is proposed for time - dependent convection - diffusion problems where the supg solution is considered as a solution of a steady - state problem such that the error estimator of @xcite becomes applicable",
    ". however , the approach relies on the heuristic argument that a certain term is of higher order and thus becomes negligible .",
    "a validation of the assumption is given for one space dimension .",
    "in numerical calculations the robustness of the error estimator and its superiority over the adaptive approach that is presented in @xcite and built upon heuristic error indicators is illustrated .",
    "a further non - robust a posteriori error of residual type estimator is presented in @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that a posteriori error estimates are available for space - time finite element methods , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , and for lagrange  galerkin methods , cf .",
    "@xcite , that are based on the method of characteristics and represent another class of prominent schemes for the approximation of evolutionary convection - dominated problems ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . a robust a priori error estimate for the lagrange  galerkin method with error constants depending only on norms of the data and not on ( higher order ) norms of the solution",
    "is presented in @xcite .",
    "the estimate is proved in a lagrangian framework instead of using eulerian coordinates as it is done in most of the error analyses for lagrange - galerkin methods .    the dual weighted residual method ( or shortly dwr method )",
    "@xcite aims at the economical computation of arbitrary quantities of physical interest by properly adapting the computational mesh .",
    "thus , the mesh adaption is based on the computation and control of a physically relevant goal quantity instead of the traditional energy - norm or the @xmath3-norm .",
    "the dwr approach relies on a space - time variational formulation of the discrete problem and uses duality techniques to find a rigorous a posteriori error estimate .",
    "such duality techniques are well known from a prior error analyses ; cf . ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the dwr approach has been applied to the numerical approximation of several classes of mathematical models based on partial differential equations , including fluid mechanics @xcite , wave propagation @xcite , structural mechanics @xcite , fluid - structure interaction @xcite , eigenvalue problems @xcite , optimization problems @xcite and , further , been applied to goal - oriented adaptive modeling @xcite . in the abstract dwr philosophy ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) an error representation for the considered goal quantity is derived by dualityx techniques at the beginning .",
    "this error identity can not be evaluated directly , since it depends on the unknown solution of the ",
    "linearized  dual or adjoint problem that has to be solved numerically .",
    "we note that the dual problem is always a linear one , such that in the case of a nonlinear partial differential equation the numerical costs for solving the dual problem requires much less work .",
    "if the primal solution is obtained by a newton iteration then solving the dual problem corresponds to one additional newton iteration in each time step . from the error representation for the goal quantity",
    "localized error indicators can be derived ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) , similarly to the traditional residual - based approach .",
    "however , the sharpess of the resulting a posteriori error estimate can not be guaranted anymore as soon as estimates are applied to the error identity .    even though the dwr approach has been applied to many classes of partial differential equations ,",
    "our feeling is that its potential for the numerical approximation of convection - dominated problems and stabilized discretizations has not been completely understood and explored yet . in the application of the dwr method the efficient and fast solution of the auxiliary dual problem and",
    "the localization of the error estimator is an essential step in practice ; cf .",
    "e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the dual solution impacts the weights of the resulting error indicators .",
    "it is well knwon that the proper choice of the weights is crucial for the effectivity of the adaptation process .",
    "they should in particular measure the influence of a present cell on the requested goal quantity of interest .",
    "the approximation of the dual solution can not be done in the finite element space of the primal problem since it would result in a useless vanishing approximation of the error quantity ; cf .",
    "@xcite . therefore",
    ", several techniques of approximation the dual solution efficienty were developed and proposed in the literature .",
    "approximation by a higher - order method , approximation by a higher - order interpolation , approximation by difference quotients and approximation by local residual problems are known approaches @xcite .",
    "in particular , higher - order interpolation is applied often in the literature ; cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite .    in this work",
    "we combine the dwr approach with stabilized approximations of convection - dominated problems .",
    "the adaptive mesh refinement process is directly based on the global error representation , up to higher order error contributions , without estimating the error terms further , i.e.  without providing the usual upper bouds for the error in the goal quantity .",
    "thereby we aim to reduce additional approximation errors and non - sharp estimates of standard error indicators and to apply the dwr approach as strictly as possible in order to get a reliable quantification and control of the error in the goal quantity instead of providing only error indicators for an economical mesh adaption strategy . in our approach",
    "the dual problem is solved by using higher oder finite element techniques . in numerical experiments",
    "we will illustrate the high impact of the proper choice of the weights and thereby of the dual solution on the mesh adaption process .",
    "our overall motivation is to reduce sources of inaccuracies and non - sharp estimates in the a posteriori error control mechanism as far as possible in order to avoid numerical artefacs and a loss of quality in the approximation of the solution and the error control in regions with sharp fronts where highly sensitive solution profiles are present and interpolations are defective .",
    "we expect that this strategy allows us to exploit the full potential of the dwr method for the a posteriori quantification of discretization errors .",
    "this is in contrast to other works of the literature on the dwr method where much effort is put in the reduction of the computation costs for solving the dual problem .",
    "thereby , the high impact of the dual solution on the error control and mesh generation process is not focused as strongly as in this work . due to the specific character of convection - dominated problems we are convinced that the error control needs a particular care in regions with interior and boundary layers and in regions with sharp fronts in order to get an accurate quantification of numerical errors . for problems with simpler structures of solutions more economical approximations of the dual solution",
    "might be sufficient and appropriate .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : pro ] , we introduce our model problem together with some global assumptions and our notation .",
    "further we present the finite element approximation of this problem and the stabilization of the discretization by using the supg method . in section [ sec : dwr ]",
    "our a posterior error control mechanism based on the dwr method is developed and localized error terms are derived . in section [ sec : pracasp ] some implementational issues are addressed .",
