    "<S> it turns out , however , that a characteristic _ short distance _ manifestation of instantons can be exploited  @xcite for an experimental search : instantons induce certain ( hard ) processes that are forbidden in usual perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> these involve all ( light ) quark flavours democratically along with a violation of chirality , in accord with the general chiral anomaly relation  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> crucial information on the region of validity for this important result , based on instanton - perturbation theory , comes from a recent high - quality lattice simulation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main event signatures comprise a `` fireball''-like final state with a very high number of hadrons , including k mesons and @xmath2 hyperons , as well as a high total transverse energy . with the help of the monte carlo generator </S>",
    "<S> qcdins for qcd - instanton - induced events in deep - inelastic scattering  @xcite , the h1 and zeus experiments at hera are actively searching for signatures of instantons in the hadronic final state . </S>",
    "<S> the challenging experimental task is to distinguish the instanton - induced signal from the normal dis final state near the edge of the available phase space . </S>",
    "<S> this effort seems however well worthwhile , since an experimental verification of such a novel , non - perturbative manifestation of qcd would be of basic significance .    at the recent dis2000 and ichep2000 conferences , </S>",
    "<S> the h1 collaboration has reported preliminary results of a first dedicated search for instanton - induced events at hera  @xcite . in a phase space region , where a reduction of the normal dis ( ndis ) background to the percent level is achieved according to standard monte carlo models , a ( statistically ) significant excess of events was found in the h1 data . while its size is at a level still comparable to the differences among standard dis event generators , it is - for the discriminating observables - qualitatively similar to the expected instanton signal . </S>",

    "<S> it is noteworthy that with increasing instanton - separation power an increasingly large excess is seen in the data . </S>",

    "<S> while there appears to be also a marked excess in the respective data , both @xmath26 and @xmath27 appear to be shifted towards smaller values than predicted by qcdins , and the widths of the experimental distributions are also considerably narrower .    </S>",

    "<S> while refraining to show the real data before their final publication , we have instead displayed the statistical errors as calculated by means of the herwig 5.9  @xcite event generator for vanishing excess . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , the corresponding number of @xmath29 ndis events from herwig after instanton - enhancement cuts ( cut - scenario * c *  @xcite ) matches quite well the values quoted by the h1 collaboration . on the other hand , the detector corrections ( </S>",
    "<S> not accounted for here ) seem to significantly reduce the number of instanton events by almost a factor of two .    </S>",
    "<S> a central issue to be discussed in this letter is the question to which extent the h1 analysis may be directly compared to our theoretical predictions , since certain fiducial cuts are lacking in the h1 data : because of difficulties with the @xmath30-reconstruction , there is presently no cut on @xmath30 , while the data are compared to qcdins with the default @xmath30-cut implemented . </S>",

    "<S> _ 5 . </S>",
    "<S> _ let us now turn to the crucial question to which extent the h1 analysis may be directly compared to our theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned earlier , possibly important fiducial cuts are lacking in the h1 data . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we address the fact that there is presently no cut on @xmath30 in the data , while these are compared to our qcdins predictions with the default @xmath30-cut implemented .    </S>",
    "<S> a glance at the lattice data for the @xmath61-distance distribution ( fig .  [ lattice ] ( top , right ) ) reveals that actually , instanton - effects seem to be very strongly suppressed , as soon as instantons and anti - instantons start `` touching '' each other , i.e. for small enough separation , @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> this rapid onset of instanton suppression corresponds to @xmath109 , which happens to coincide with our default @xmath30-cut . </S>",
    "<S> hence , since our qcdins predictions , _ with _ the @xmath30-cut implemented , model quite well the actual suppression ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lattice ] ( top , right ) and ( bottom , right ) ) , we consider the lacking experimental reconstruction of @xmath30 not a serious problem in principle </S>",
    "<S> .    quantitatively speaking , however , the lacking experimental @xmath30-cut leads to a quite substantial ambiguity in the expected _ size _ of the instanton signal in the various observables . in this case , the onset of the actual instanton suppression from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lattice ] ( top , right ) , modelled by an @xmath30-cut within the allowed theoretical @xmath110-uncertainty window ( [ xprime ] ) , gives rise to a possible increase of the size of the instanton signal up to a factor of three compared to our default prediction . </S>",
    "<S> this is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mixed ] ( left ) . yet </S>",
    "<S> , the predicted _ shapes _ of the six distributions in fig .  [ h1-obs ] are virtually unaffected by this important remaining uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> upon variation of @xmath111 within the window ( [ xprime ] ) , we note that to very good approximation , the predicted instanton - induced excess in all six h1 observables of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ h1-obs ] varies by the _ </S>",
    "<S> common _ factor displayed in fig .  [ mixed ] ( left ) for cut - scenario * c*. in particular , a slight reduction , @xmath112 , compared to the qcdins default @xmath30-cut , leads to an increase of the instanton signal by a factor of two , representing a remarkably good description of the observed excess in four ( @xmath17 , @xmath113 , @xmath22 and @xmath114 ) out of the six experimentally considered observables . while the size of the observed excess in the remaining two observables @xmath115 and @xmath23 is quite satisfactorily described as well , </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath26 and @xmath27 appear to be shifted towards smaller values than predicted by qcdins , and the widths of the experimental distributions are also considerably narrower .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall argue next that this apparent discrepancy is actually a consequence of the experimentally lacking but theoretically required cut in @xmath116 , @xmath117 as a brief reminder  @xcite , this cut assures in particular the dominance of `` planar '' handbag - type graphs in @xmath63 and all final - state observables . </S>",
    "<S> the non - planar contributions do not share the simple , probabilistic interpretation of the planar ones , involve instantons with a size determined by @xmath118 rather than @xmath119 and are both hard to calculate and hard to implement in a monte carlo generator . on account of their known power suppression in @xmath120 and a cross - check in the simplest case without final - state gluons  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , they can be safely neglected upon application of the cut ( [ q2cut ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> because of these reasons , the non - planar contributions are not implemented in qcdins .    in order to gain some further insight as to the influence of this @xmath116-cut , </S>",
    "<S> consider @xmath23 , for example , for which one may easily derive the following simple expression on the parton level in the hadronic cms , @xmath121 involving besides @xmath122 and @xmath30 , the bjorken-@xmath123 of the @xmath124 subprocess in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ kin - var ] . </S>",
    "<S> the important issue to be exploited next is the strong correlation between @xmath116 and @xmath123 , apparent in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> mixed ] ( middle ) . already at this point </S>",
    "<S> , it is clear that via its @xmath123-dependence  ( [ etjet ] ) , the @xmath23-distribution is strongly dependent on the underlying @xmath116-spectrum . in absence of the theoretically required cut in @xmath116 , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath123-distribution peaks sharply around @xmath125 according to qcdins and involves a fairly small @xmath126 gev@xmath32 ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mixed ] ( middle ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this dominating and theoretically uncontrollable low-@xmath116 portion of the spectrum is responsible for the @xmath23-peak being located at too large a value , since @xmath127 in good agreement with the direct ( but unreliable ) result from qcdins in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ h1-obs ] , not involving a cut in @xmath116 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ tb ]    with this insight , let us perform the following exercise . </S>",
    "<S> we deplete the low-@xmath116 portion of the spectrum by means of a cut , @xmath128 , in the ( internal ) bjorken-@xmath123 variable . </S>",
    "<S> the qcdins results should now be about reliable since from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mixed ] ( middle ) we have effected a shift to @xmath129 gev@xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the striking result of this exercise is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ obsdev ] for the six shape - normalized distributions of the h1 observables . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we observe that the shapes of the four distributions of @xmath17 , @xmath113 , @xmath22 and @xmath114 , for which there was good agreement with the observed excess before applying the @xmath123-cut , remain essentially unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> their shapes are thus rather insensitive to the @xmath116-spectrum and should be reliably predicted by qcdins , even without application of the required cut in @xmath116 . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the shape - normalized distributions of @xmath130 and @xmath115 appear both shifted significantly towards smaller values and are now much narrower . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the shape - normalized @xmath23-distribution is now in virtually perfect agreement with the corresponding experimental quantity . </S>",
    "<S> also the @xmath115-distribution matches well the experimental trend , after this depletion of the low-@xmath116 region .    on the one hand </S>",
