    "an important outcome of string theory is the realization that coordinates may become noncommutative operators on a @xmath0-brane @xcite .",
    "the result is a fundamental discretization of spacetime due to the commutator @xmath1=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath2 is an antisymmetric matrix , similar to the way that the planck constant @xmath3 discretizes phase space .",
    "noncommutativity replaces point - like objects by smeared objects @xcite .",
    "the goal is to eliminate the divergences that normally appear in general relativity .",
    "the smearing effect can be accomplished by using a gaussian distribution of minimal length @xmath4 instead of the dirac delta function in the following manner : the energy - density of the static and spherically symmetric and particle - like gravitational source has the form @xcite @xmath5 here the mass @xmath6 is diffused throughout the region of linear dimension @xmath4 due to the uncertainty .",
    "the noncommutative geometry is an intrinsic property of spacetime and does not depend on particular features such as curvature .",
    "noncommutative geometry has proved to be an effective tool in several areas .",
    "thus garattini and lobo @xcite obtained a self - sustained wormhole using a semiclassical analysis .",
    "kuhfittig @xcite showed that a special class of thin - shell wormholes posses small regions of stability around the thin shell even though they are unstable in classical general relativity .",
    "rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that a noncommutative - geometry background is sufficient for producing stable circular orbits in a typical galaxy without the need for dark matter .    turning our attention now to traversable wormholes , recall that the line element describing a morris - thorne wormhole is given by @xcite    @xmath7    here @xmath8 is called the _ shape function _ and @xmath9 the _ redshift function _ , which must be everywhere finite to prevent an event horizon .",
    "for the shape function we must have @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radius of the _ throat _ of the wormhole .",
    "in addition , @xmath12 and @xmath13 to satisfy the _ flare - out condition _",
    "@xcite . the flare - out condition , in turn ,",
    "can only be satisfied by violating the _ weak energy condition _",
    ", to be discussed below . for ordinary matter , this violation can only be accomplished by the use of  exotic matter . \"    the parameter @xmath14 occurring in noncommutative geometry suggests the existence of a very small scale leading to wormholes that are actually microscopic .",
    "this would require a semi - classical framework , as carried out in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "using @xmath15 instead of @xmath16 for the horizontal axis in references @xcite also suggests that small values of @xmath16 are intended . using reference @xcite as a starting point ,",
    "it is shown in this paper that such a wormhole can be macroscopic and that the noncommutative - geometry background replaces the exotic matter .",
    "moreover , the model presented has zero tidal forces , thereby making it suitable for humanoid travelers .",
    "finally , it is proposed that these wormholes can be made stable to linearized radial perturbations .",
    "to make the wormholes suitable for humanoid travelers , it is desirable to have a constant redshift function , so that @xmath17 , the so - called zero - tidal - force solution proposed in reference @xcite .",
    "given this condition , the einstein field equations become @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20}.\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is the energy - density , equation ( [ e : rho ] ) , @xmath22 is the radial pressure , and @xmath23 the lateral pressure .    making use of equation ( [ e : rho ] ) , we obtain the shape function @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is an integration constant .",
    "( how @xmath6 is related to the mass of the wormhole will be seen at the end of section [ s : violation ] . )",
    "this solution is also given in reference @xcite , where it is shown that the wormhole spacetime is asymptotically flat .",
    "since @xmath25 is an integration constant , mathematically @xmath26 in equation ( [ e : shape ] ) is a valid solution for every @xmath25 .",
    "the flare - out condition , among others , is a physical requirement that is satisfied only for a certain range of values of @xmath25 . to show that the wormhole is macroscopic , we use a graphical approach , as in reference @xcite , by assigning values to the parameters that are not only typical but help produce useful and revealing graphs . since we are using geometrized units ( with @xmath27 )",
    ", the mass @xmath6 takes on units of length ; so it is desirable to measure distances in meters , as in references @xcite .",
    "moreover , unlike references @xcite , we plot @xmath26 against @xmath16 , rather than @xmath15 . as an illustration ,",
    "suppose we choose @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 to obtain @xmath26 in figure 1 .",
    "-intercept of @xmath31 . ]",
    "the throat of the wormhole is located at @xmath11 , where @xmath32 intersects the @xmath16-axis , shown in figure 2 .",
    "the throat radius turns out to be @xmath33 m , which is definitely macroscopic , a conclusion already deducible from reference @xcite .",
    "( the value can be readily increased by adjusting the parameters . )",
    "according to figure 2 , for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 , which implies that @xmath37 for @xmath34 . also , since @xmath38 is decreasing , we have @xmath39 and hence @xmath12 .",
    "the flare - out condition is therefore satisfied .",
    "next , recall from reference @xcite that the condition @xmath12 implies that @xmath40 , a condition that is normally associated with exotic matter .",
    "however , there exist other possibilities .",
    "for example , phantom energy is characterized by the equation of state @xmath41 , @xmath42 , which yields @xmath43 . in the present situation ,",
    "equations ( [ e : einstein2 ] ) and ( [ e : shape ] ) imply that @xmath44.\\ ] ] in reference @xcite , it is shown graphically that @xmath40 near the throat , i.e. , @xmath45<0\\ ] ] for certain choices of the parameters . for the values in the above example ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ) , we obtain , at the throat @xmath33 , @xmath46 .",
    "it is important to realize that this is a direct consequence of the noncommutative - geometry background , rather than to some form of  exotic matter . \"",
    "the reason is that we are not following the strategy in reference @xcite , tailoring @xmath26 and @xmath47 to produce a traversable wormhole , while letting @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 dangle . instead , @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath22 were obtained from @xmath21 in equation ( [ e : rho ] ) and the einstein field equations ; @xmath23 is derived in reference @xcite .",
    "since the smearing effect is heavily influenced by the size of @xmath14 , smaller values should be considered .",
    "( recall that @xmath29 was chosen mainly for producing useful graphs . )",
    "it turns out , however , that reducing @xmath14 seems to have little effect on the outcome with one notable exception : as @xmath14 gets smaller , @xmath51 gets closer to zero .",
    "this is to be expected since @xmath52 , a constant .",
    "the slow flaring out , however , could have an effect on the proper distance around the throat . to provide a numerical check on our example ,",
    "consider the coordinate distance given by the interval [ 0.18462 m , 100 m ] .",
    "the corresponding proper distance is @xmath53 so the proper distance is not much larger than the coordinate distance . _",
    "remark : _ the above limit , @xmath54 , shows that @xmath55 , the schwarzschild limit .",
    "so in the above example , since @xmath28 and @xmath30 , we obtain @xmath56 m , which may be viewed as the mass of the wormhole relative to a distant observer .",
    "it is pointed out in reference @xcite that it is possible in principle to construct a wormhole that is stable to linearized radial perturbations .",
    "the wormhole has to meet the usual conditions at the throat , but when joined to an external schwarzschild spacetime at the junction surface @xmath57 , some additional conditions need to be met : to be a stable wormhole , the redshift function @xmath9 must satisfy the conditions @xmath58 referring to the left- and right - hand limits , respectively . [ in other words , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . ]",
    "it is also shown in reference @xcite that the shape function @xmath8 must be an increasing function of @xmath16 having a continuous second derivative and that it must attain a maximum value at @xmath61 .",
    "for such a shape function , the stability criterion is surprisingly simple : @xmath62 the implication is that from the standpoint of theoretical construction , this condition would not be difficult to meet . joining our earlier solution , namely @xmath63 ( i.e. , @xmath64 and equation ( [ e : shape ] ) , to this new solution will require transitional curves that smoothly connect , respectively , the redshift and shape functions .",
    "the result is a stable wormhole",
    ".    this construction does not depend on any particular properties of the wormhole , suggesting that any wormhole can be made stable to linearized radial perturbations .",
    "it is shown in this paper that it is possible in principle to design or construct a traversable wormhole with zero tidal forces in a noncommutative - geometry setting .",
    "not only is the wormhole spacetime macroscopic and asymptotically flat , the violation of the weak energy condition is due to the noncommutative geometry , rather than to  exotic matter . \"",
    "so if string theory is correct , then the laws of physics seem to allow macroscopic traversable wormholes with zero tidal forces .",
