    "social systems generally display complex features  @xcite .",
    "complexity is present at the individual level : the behavior of humans often obeys complex dynamical patterns as for example demonstrated by the rules governing electronic correspondence  @xcite . at the same time , complexity is present also at the global level .",
    "this can be seen for example when social systems are mathematically represented in terms of graphs or networks , where vertices identify individuals and edges stand for interactions between pairs of social agents .",
    "social networks are in most of the cases _ scale - free _  @xcite , indicating therefore a strong degree of complexity from the topological and global points of view .",
    "+ during last years , the analysis of social systems has become an important topic of interdisciplinary research and as such has started to be not longer of interest to social scientists only .",
    "the presence of a huge amount of digital data , describing the activity of humans and the way in which they interact , has made possible the analysis of large - scale systems .",
    "this new trend of research does not focus on the behavior of single agents , but mainly on the analysis of the macroscopic and statistical properties of the whole population , with the aim to discover regularities and universal rules . in this sense",
    ", professional sports also represent optimal sources of data .",
    "soccer  @xcite , football  @xcite , baseball  @xcite and basketball  @xcite are some remarkable cases in which network analysis revealed features not visible with traditional approaches .",
    "these are practical examples of the general outcome produced by the intense research activity of last years : network tools and theories do not serve only for descriptive purposes , but have also wide practical applicability . representing a real system as a network allows in fact to have a global view of the system and simultaneously use the entire information encoded by its complete list of interactions .",
    "particularly relevant results are those regarding : the robustness of networks under intentional attacks  @xcite ; the spreading of viruses in graphs  @xcite ; synchronization processes  @xcite , social models  @xcite , and evolutionary and coevolutionary games  @xcite taking place on networks . in this context fall also ranking techniques like the pagerank algorithm  @xcite , where vertices are ranked on the basis of their `` centrality '' in a diffusion process occurring on the graph .",
    "diffusion algorithms , originally proposed for ranking web pages , have been recently applied to citation networks  @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the popularity of papers  @xcite , journals  @xcite and scientists  @xcite is performed not by looking at local properties of the network ( i.e. , number of citations ) but by measuring their degree of centrality in the flow of information diffusing over the entire graph .",
    "the use of the whole network leads to better evaluation criteria without the addition of external ingredients because the complexity of the citation process is encoded by the topology of the graph .",
    "+        in this paper we continue in this direction of research and present a novel example of a real system , taken from the world of professional sports , suitable for network representation .",
    "we consider the list of all tennis matches played by professional players during the last @xmath2 years ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) .",
    "matches are considered as basic contacts between the actors in the network and weighted connections are drawn on the basis of the number of matches between the same two opponents .",
    "we first provide evidence of the complexity of the network of contacts between tennis players .",
    "we then develop a ranking algorithm similar to pagerank and quantify the importance of tennis players with the so - called `` prestige score '' .",
    "the results presented here indicate once more that ranking techniques based on networks outperform traditional methods .",
    "the prestige score is in fact more accurate and has higher predictive power than well established ranking schemes adopted in professional tennis .",
    "more importantly , our ranking method does not require the introduction of external criteria for the assessment of the quality of players and tournaments .",
    "their importance is self - determined by the various competitive processes described by the intricate network of contacts .",
    "our algorithm does nothing more than taking into account this information .",
    "data were collected from the web site of the association of tennis professionals ( atp , www.atpworldtour.com ) .",
    "we automatically downloaded all matches played by professional tennis players from january @xmath0 to october @xmath1 .",
    "we restrict our analysis only to matches played in grand slams and atp world tour tournaments for a total of @xmath3 tournaments and @xmath4 matches . for illustrative purposes , in the top plot of the panel a of figure  [ fig1 ] , we report the number of tournaments played in each of the years covered by our data set . with the exception of the period between @xmath0 and @xmath5 , when atp was still in its infancy , about @xmath6 tournaments",
    "were played each year .",
    "two periods of larger popularity were registered around years @xmath7 and @xmath8 when more than @xmath9 tournaments per year were played .",
    "the total number of different players present in our data set is @xmath10 , and in the bottom plot of panel a of figure  [ fig1 ] we show how many players played at least one match in each of the years covered by our analysis . in this case , the function is less regular . on average ,",
    "@xmath11 different players played in each of the years between @xmath0 and @xmath12 .",
    "large fluctuations are anyway visible and a very high peak in @xmath7 , when more than @xmath13 players participated in atp tournaments , is also present . between @xmath12 and @xmath14 ,",
    "the number of players decreased from @xmath11 to @xmath15 in an almost linear fashion .",
    "after that , the number of participants in atp tournaments started to be more constant with small fluctuations around an average of about @xmath15 players .",
    "we represent the data set as a network of contacts between tennis players .",
    "this is a very natural representation of the system since a single match can be viewed as an elementary contact between two opponents .",
    "each time the player @xmath16 plays and wins against player @xmath17 , we draw a directed connection from @xmath17 to @xmath16 [ @xmath18 , see figure  [ fig2 ] ] .",
    "we adopt a weighted representation of the contacts  @xcite , by assigning to the generic directed edge @xmath18 a weight @xmath19 equal to the number of times that player @xmath17 looses against player @xmath16 .",
    "our data are flexible and allow various levels of representation by including for example only matches played in a certain period of time , on a certain type of surface , etc .",
    "an example is reported in panel a of figure  [ fig2 ] where the network of contacts is restricted only to the @xmath20 players having been number one in the official atp ranking . in general",
    ", networks obtained from the aggregation of a sufficiently high number of matches have topological complex features consistent with the majority of networked social systems so far studied in literature  @xcite .",
    "typical measures revealing complex structure are represented by the probability density functions of the in- and out - strengths of vertices  @xcite , both following a clear power - law behavior [ see figure  [ fig1 ] , panel b ] . in our social system , this means that most of the players perform a small number of matches ( won or lost ) and then quit playing in major tournaments . on the other hand ,",
    "a small set of top players performs many matches against worse opponents ( generally beating them ) and also many matches ( won or lost ) against other top players .",
    "this picture is consistent with the so - called `` matthew effect '' in career longevity recently observed also in other professional sports  @xcite .",
    "the network representation can be used for ranking players . in our interpretation",
    ", each player in the network carries a unit of `` tennis prestige '' and we imagine that prestige flows in the graph along its weighted connections .",
    "the process can be mathematically solved by determining the solution of the system of equations @xmath21 valid for all nodes @xmath22 , with the additional constraint that @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 indicates the total number of players ( vertices ) in the network , while @xmath25 is the out - strength of the node @xmath17 ( i.e. , the sum of the weight of all edges departing from vertex @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath26 is the `` prestige score '' assigned to player @xmath16 and represents the fraction of the overall tennis prestige sitting , in the steady state of the diffusion process , on vertex @xmath16 . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pg ] ) , @xmath27 $ ] is a control parameter which accounts for the importance of the various terms contributing to the score of the nodes .",
    "the term @xmath28 represents the portion of score received by node @xmath16 in the diffusion process : vertices redistribute their entire credit to neighboring nodes proportionally to the weight of the connections linking to them .",
    "@xmath29 stands for a uniform redistribution of tennis prestige among all nodes according to which each player in the graph receives a constant and equal amount of credit . finally the term @xmath30 [ with @xmath31 equal to one only if its argument is equal to zero , and zero otherwise ] serves as a correction in the case of existence of dandling nodes ( i.e. , nodes with null out - strength ) , which otherwise would behave as sinks in the diffusion process .",
    "our prestige score is analogous to the pagerank score  @xcite , originally formulated for ranking web pages and more recently applied in different contexts .",
    "+ in general topologies , analytical solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pg ] ) are hard to find .",
    "the stationary values of the scores @xmath26s can be anyway computed recursively , by setting at the beginning @xmath32 ( but the results do not depend on the choice of the initial value ) and iterating eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pg ] ) until they converge to values stable within _ a priori _ fixed precision .       as a function of the number of victories",
    "@xmath33 in a tournament with @xmath34 rounds ( grand slam ) .",
    "black circles are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s6 ] ) and valid for @xmath35 .",
    "all other values of @xmath36 have been calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s5 ] ) : red squares stand for @xmath37 , blue diamonds for @xmath38 , violet up - triangles for @xmath39 and green down - triangles for @xmath40.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the simplest case in which the graph is obtained by aggregating matches of a single tournament only , we can analytically determine the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pg ] ) . in a single tournament ,",
    "matches are hierarchically organized in a binary rooted tree and the topology of the resulting contact network is very simple [ see figure  [ fig2 ] , panels b and c ] . indicate with @xmath41 the number of matches that the winner of the tournament should play ( and win ) .",
    "the total number of players present at the beginning of the tournament is @xmath42 .",
    "the prestige score is simply a function of @xmath33 , the number of matches won by a player , and can be denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "we can rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pg ] ) as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the score @xmath43 is given by the sum of two terms : @xmath47 stands for the equal contribution shared by all players independently of the number of victories ; @xmath48 represents the score accrued for the number of matches won .",
    "the former system of equations has a recursive solution given by @xmath49 which is still dependent on a constant that can be determined by implementing the normalization condition @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s3 ] ) , @xmath51 indicates the number of players who have won @xmath33 matches .",
    "we have @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 and eqs .",

    "finally , we obtain @xmath61 which together with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s2 ] ) provides the solution @xmath62 it is worth to notice that for @xmath40 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s5 ] ) correctly give @xmath63 for any @xmath33 , meaning that , in absence of diffusion , prestige is homogeneously distributed among all nodes .",
    "conversely , for @xmath35 the solution is @xmath64 in figure  [ fig3 ] , we plot eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s5 ] ) and  ( [ eq : s6 ] ) for various values of @xmath65 . in general ,",
    "sufficiently low values of @xmath65 allow to assign to the winner of the tournament a score which is about two order of magnitude larger than the one given to players loosing at the first round .",
    "the score of the winner is an exponential function of @xmath41 , the length of the tournament .",
    "grand slams have for instance length @xmath66 and their relative importance is therefore two or four times larger than the one of other atp tournaments , typically having lengths @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
