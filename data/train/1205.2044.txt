    "csm describes the situation when nonlinear resonances are equidistant in phase space which corresponds to a local description of dynamical chaos @xcite . due to this",
    "property various dynamical systems and maps can be locally reduced to map ( [ smap ] ) .",
    "thus , csm describes the universal and generic behavior of nearly - integrable hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom having a divided phase space composed of stochastic motion bounded by invariant tori ( also known as kam scenario ) @xcite .",
    "csm develops two dynamical regimes separated by the critical parameter @xmath1 @xcite . when @xmath3 , regime of weak nonlinearity , the motion is mainly regular with regions of stocasticity and @xmath16 is bounded by kam surfaces .",
    "see for example fig .",
    "[ fig0](a ) where we present the poincar surface of section for csm with @xmath17 . here",
    ", the value of @xmath2 is so small that the poincar surface of section is equivalent to the phase portrait of a one - dimensional pendulum . at @xmath18 ,",
    "the last kam curve is destroyed and the transition to global stocasticity takes place .",
    "then , for @xmath4 , regime of strong nonlinearity , @xmath16 becomes unbounded and increases diffusively .",
    "see for example the poincar map of fig .",
    "[ fig0](b ) where a single trajectory has been iterated @xmath19 times .",
    "even though csm describes the universal behavior of area - preserving continuous maps , another class of hamiltonian dynamical systems is represented by the _ discontinuous _",
    "map @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "examples of physical systems described by discontinuous maps are 2d billiard models like the stadium billiard @xcite and polygonal billiards @xcite .",
    "the origin of the discontinuity in map ( [ map ] ) are the sudden translations of the action under the system dynamics .    as well as csm , map ( [ map ] )",
    "is known to have two different dynamical regimes , however both diffusive , delimited by the critical value @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the regimes @xmath3 and @xmath4 are known as slow diffusion and quasilinear diffusion regimes , respectively . as an example of the dynamics of map ( [ map ] ) , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show typical poincar surface of sections in both regimes ( for comparison purposes we have used the same values of @xmath2 as in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] for csm ) . on the one hand , as can be observed by contrasting figs .",
    "[ fig0](a ) and [ fig1](a ) , the main difference between csm and map ( [ map ] ) is that for @xmath3 the later does not show regular behavior .",
    "in fact , due to the discontinuities of @xmath15 in map ( [ map ] ) , kam theorem is not satisfied and map ( [ map ] ) does not develop the kam scenario . since for any @xmath23 the dynamics of map ( [ map ] ) is diffusive , a single trajectory can explore the entire phase space .",
    "however , in the slow diffusion regime the dynamics is far from being stochastic due to the sticking of trajectories along cantori ( fragments of kam invariant tori ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . on the other hand , for @xmath4 map ( [ map ] ) shows diffusion similar to that of csm , compare figs .",
    "[ fig0](b ) and [ fig1](b ) .",
    "we want to add that independently of the value of @xmath23 , map ( [ map ] ) has five period - one fixed points at @xmath24 and @xmath25 $ ] .    in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite a scaling analysis of csm was performed by studying the average value of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 and the @xmath9-th iteration of the map . there , the following scaling law was reported : @xmath26 where @xmath27 for @xmath5 and small @xmath9 while @xmath28 for @xmath6 and large @xmath9 , with @xmath11 in both cases .",
    "the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) has also been validated for several dynamical systems represented by the standard map such as the fermi - ulam model @xcite , time - dependent potential wells @xcite , and waveguide billiards @xcite ; among others @xcite .",
    "although map ( [ map ] ) has the same structure than csm , a systematic investigation of the scaling properties of @xmath0 for discontinuous maps is not available in the literature .",
