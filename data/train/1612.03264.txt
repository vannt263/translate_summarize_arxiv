    "a self - reinforcing solitary wave which preserves its shape while traversing at a constant speed is known as a bright soliton .",
    "the origin of the bright solitons is due to a cancellation of the effects produced by non - linear and dispersive terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "solitons have been studied in a wide range of systems ranging from water waves , non - linear optics @xcite , ultracold quantum gases including spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , etc . in this paper , we study the two - dimensional ( 2d ) vortex - bright solitons in spin - orbit ( so ) coupled three - component spin-1 spinor bose - einstein condensates . the so coupling is the coupling between the spin of the atom and its center of mass motion . in neutral atoms ,",
    "the so coupling is absent @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , neutral atoms can be subjected to the so coupling by creating a non - abelian gauge potential by suitably modifying the atom - light interaction @xcite .",
    "the so coupling with equal strengths of rashba @xcite and dresselhaus @xcite terms was first engineered in a landmark experiment with a bec of @xmath0rb by dressing two of its internal spin states from within the ground electronic manifold ( @xmath1 ) with a pair of lasers @xcite . in recent years",
    ", a variety of experimental studies have been done on so - coupled bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "solitonic structures have been theoretically investigated in so - coupled quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) @xcite and quasi-2d pseudospin-1/2 condensates @xcite .",
    "bright solitons have also been theoretically studied in so - coupled quasi-1d spin-1 @xcite and spin-2 condensates @xcite .    in this paper , we study the stable stationary and moving vortex - bright solitons in a quasi-2d @xcite so - coupled spin-1 condensate using the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations @xcite .",
    "we observe that for small strengths of so coupling which we employ in the paper , the ground state vortex - bright soliton of an so - coupled polar and weakly - ferromagnetic spin-1 condensate is an axisymmetric vortex - bright soliton of type @xmath2 with zero magnetization , where the numbers in the parenthesis are the phase - winding numbers ( angular momenta ) @xcite associated with the spin components @xmath3 .",
    "an anti - vortex in component @xmath4 is associated with an overlapping vortex of opposite circulation in @xmath5 component . besides this",
    ", we have also identified a stationary excited axisymmetric vortex - bright soliton of type @xmath6 .",
    "the spin texture of this excited state vortex - bright soliton shows that it is a _ coreless anderson - toulose _ vortex @xcite . for condensates with stronger ferromagnetic interaction ,",
    "the ground state is an asymmetric vortex - bright soliton with an anti - vortex of unit charge in the spin component @xmath4 associated with a vortex of opposite circulation in the @xmath5 component . in this case",
    "the vortex and anti - vortex are separated from each other , and the separation can occur along any arbitrary direction , which will get spontaneously chosen in an experiment , in two - dimensional plane .",
    "however , the condensate collapses for very strong ferromagnetic interaction and no vortex - bright soliton can be formed .",
    "the 2d vortex - bright solitons were first suggested and studied in the pseudospin-1/2 two - component spin-1 bec @xcite , which is an approximation over the present three - component model of spin-1 bec . in general , the implementation of so interaction in the three - component spin-1 bec is more complicated than the same in the two - component pseudospin-1/2 bec from both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite point of view .",
    "the present study goes beyond that previous investigation @xcite .",
    "it provides a more intuitive understanding of the role of so coupling in generating the solitons , viz . figs .",
    "[ fig0](a)-(b ) , in addition to a critical study of statics and interaction dynamics of the 2d solitons .",
    "although these solitons behave as true solitons in frontal collision at high velocities , at low velocities , depending on the relative phase , they may repel and bounce back like in the collision of two rigid elastic disks or may transfer all atoms to one soliton to form a soliton molecule .",
    "only the collision of two 1d analytic solitons is truly elastic at all velocities .    besides stationary vortex - bright solitons",
    ", we have also investigated the stable moving vortex - bright soliton of the so - coupled spin-1 condensate .",
    "as the present mean - field model does not possess galelian invariance , the moving solitons are calculated with the galelian - transformed model @xcite .",
    "we find that the structure of the moving vortex - bright soliton is a function of both the magnitude and the direction of velocity , which can result in different density distributions for vortex - bright solitons moving along different directions . at low velocities",
    ", the collision of two vortex - bright solitons with a phase difference of @xmath7 is elastic .",
    "the two solitons repel and avoid each other and rebound from the center of collision without ever forming an overlapped profile .",
    "the collision dynamics is demonstrated to obey classical laws of motion .",
    "if the same initial guess is used for the right and the left moving solitons in the numerical simulation of the stationary state , the solitons acquire a phase difference of @xmath7 .",
    "if this phase difference is removed before the numerical simulation of the colliding solitons , then after the collision between the two slow moving vortex - bright solitons , all the atoms end up being captured by one of the solitons . similarly , in the collision of two normal bec solitons at sufficiently low velocities , the two colliding solitons lose their identity and form a stable overlapping profile called a soliton molecule @xcite . at large velocities ,",
    "the two vortex - bright solitons undergo quasi - elastic collision with the two solitons crossing each other irrespective of the phase difference .",
