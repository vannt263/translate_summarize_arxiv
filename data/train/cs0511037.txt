    "papr reduction is mostly addressed and considered as an important issue for ofdm systems .",
    "however , it is a substantial practical problem for nyquist filtered modulations as well . in a communication system link , due to bandwidth limitation ,",
    "a pulse shaping filter is required after baseband modulation to suppress the sidelobes of the power spectra of psk and qam signals .",
    "root raised cosine ( rrc ) filters are commonly used as the pulse shaping filter at the transmitter .",
    "and the receiver uses an identical filter as matched filter so that the overall pulse shaping spectrum will be the regular raised cosine ( rc ) spectrum @xcite , which satisfies the nyquist criterion for distortionless baseband transmission in the absence of noise @xcite . the pulse shaping filter introduces envelope variation to psk and amplifies envelope fluctuation of qam . in the presence of envelope fluctuation , nonlinearity of the transmit high - power amplifier ( hpa ) will cause intermodulation distortion and the sidelobes which have been removed by filtering will regrow . to prevent spectrum spreading , an hpa has to operate in the linear zone , which leads to low power efficiency @xcite .",
    "nonconstant envelope signals with pulse - shaping filters ( for example psk and qam ) have better spectrum efficiency than constant envelope signals .",
    "yet people tend to use constant envelope modulations such as gmsk @xcite , cpm @xcite and xpsk ( also known as fqpsk ) @xcite to satisfy the power efficiency requirements .",
    "a coding - based method can effectively reduce the papr of filtered psk and qam signals and thus increases power efficiency .",
    "there are many coding - based papr reduction methods for ofdm in the literature , such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . however , these methods restrict the application of coding to the digital domain .",
    "this paper presents a new method employing a nonlinear convolutional coding strategy to control the analog waveform directly to achieve papr reduction .",
    "the rrc filter is viewed as a convolutional encoder .",
    "pruning certain edges of the encoder trellis can eliminate output waveforms that contribute to high papr .",
    "this trellis pruning method can be generally applied to all psk and qam modulations .",
    "qpsk and 16-qam are considered as examples .",
    "simulation results show that the pruning method yields especially good results when applied to 16-qam , reducing the papr with negligible damage to capacity .",

    ", width=288 ]        consider the root raised - cosine ( rrc ) pulse shaped qpsk modulation .",
    "the rrc shaping pulse is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the roll off factor and w is the ideal nyquist bandwidth @xcite .",
    "this paper considers a causal pulse shaping filter with finite length given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the symbol duration and the delay is @xmath8 symbols .",
    "truncating length of the filter is equal to twice the delay .",
    "the filter output waveform is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the input sequence with symbols drawn from qpsk constellation .",
    "we view the pulse shaping filter as a 4-ary convolutional encoder with @xmath11 shift registers .",
    "therefore , total number of states of the convolutional encoder is equal to @xmath12 .",
    "the output associated with the state transition initiated by the @xmath13th input qpsk message symbol @xmath14 is @xmath15 for @xmath16 . from ,",
    "@xmath17 is solely determined by the @xmath13th input and @xmath11 message symbols stored in the shift register .",
    "an example of the trellis of such an encoder with 1024 states ( d=3 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trellisnoprune ] .",
    "the corresponding output waveforms are listed in fig .",

    ", when @xmath18 adds constructively , the trajectory of @xmath17 goes far away from the origin ; when @xmath18 adds destructively , the trajectory of @xmath17 goes close to the origin .",
    "therefore , some edges of the trellis produce zero - crossing output waveforms ( as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : outputwave ] ( a)-(d ) ) , and some produce peaks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : outputwave ] ( e)-(h ) ) .",
    "pruning such edges , i.e. , eliminating the state transitions that generate large peak or zero - crossing , reduces the papr significantly .",
    "take the trellis in fig .",
    "[ fig : trellisnoprune ] as example . edge ( d ) and ( h ) will be pruned .",
    "the state transitions that follow the pruned edges will take one of the three remaining edges from the same state . the new trellis , which characterizes the pruning convolutional encoder , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trellisprune ] .    the trellis pruning method for qpsk modulation also applies to rrc filtered 16-qam modulation .",
    "the only difference is that the pulse shaping filter is now viewed as a 16-ary convolutional encoder .",
    "this section provides papr reduction results using the method described in section [ sec : pruning method ] .",
    "there are many pruning strategies to choose from .",
    "this paper uses the following strategy : edges of the trellis that produce output waveforms going farthest away from the origin ( peak ) and passing nearest to the origin ( zero - crossing ) are simultaneously pruned .",
    "we use pruning percentage @xmath19 to measure how much pruning is actually performed .",
    "@xmath19 is defined as @xmath20    all the filters used in the simulations have a delay @xmath8 of @xmath21 symbols .",
    "[ fig : constellation ] shows the trajectory diagrams of rrc filtered qpsk signals without pruning and with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 pruning respectively .",
    "it is clear that with the increase of the pruning percentage , zero - crossing and peak waveforms are eliminated .",
    "the above pruning strategy is simulated for both qpsk and 16-qam for various pruning percentage , where the shaping filters are the rrc filters of different roll - off factors .",
    "[ fig : papr ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : qam_papr ] shows that the pruning method can effectively reduce the papr of both modulation schemes .",
    "the reduction of the papr is more significant for 16-qam : a @xmath25 pruning can reduce the papr by more than @xmath26 .",
    "viterbi algorithm is typically used to decode convolutional codes .",
    "however , the number of states of the encoder presented in this paper grows exponentially with the length of the pulse shaping filter and constellation size . with the increase of filter length and the expansion of constellation from qpsk to 16-qam",
    ", the complexity of viterbi algorithm makes it computationally intractable .",
    "therefore , we use a forward only decision feedback aided bcjr algorithm with much lower complexity as the decoding algorithm .        we model the pruning convolutional encoder as a finite - state machine ( fsm ) @xcite .",

    "therefore , the app value becomes @xmath55 from , it is clear that the decoding algorithm has a complexity growing linearly with the number of states .    to achieve good performance of the decoding algorithm",
