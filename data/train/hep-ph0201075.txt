    "nowadays the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics is well established .",
    "some parts of it ( e.g. the properties of the @xmath8 boson ) have been tested to an accuracy far below the percent level  mostly at the cern large - electron - positron collider ( lep , geneva ) , at the slac linear collider ( slc , stanford ) and at the fermilab tevatron ( chicago ) . up to now",
    "no significant deviation between theory and experiment has been found .",
    "for other parts of the sm , related to cp violation and quark mixing , the @xmath9 factories like babar at slac , belle at kek ( tsukuba ) or hera - b at desy ( hamburg ) will provide deeper insight , and significant improvements in the determination of the corresponding parameters will be obtained .",
    "currently mainly the scalar sector of the sm eludes from direct experimental observation .",
    "this affects both the generation of the particle masses and the existence of the higgs boson itself .",
    "probably run ii of the tevatron and certainly the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will provide more sureness  not only in connection to the higgs sector but also to possible extensions of the sm .",
    "once the higgs boson would be discovered it immediately would become subject to precision measurements .",
    "in particular at a future @xmath2 linear collider such as desy tesla , a precise study of its properties would be possible .",
    "in the recent years there has been an enormous development in the evaluation of radiative corrections .",
    "it is fair to say that the major part of it was initiated by the fundamental works of t  hooft and veltman in 1972  @xcite where dimensional regularization ( see also  @xcite ) was established as a powerful tool in the evaluation of multi - loop diagrams . since that time",
    "a whole industry has been formed to develop techniques for the computation of complicated feynman integrals . at one - loop order",
    "the procedure of the computation has been systematically studied quite some time ago  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless also nowadays it is not completely straightforward to evaluate an arbitrary one - loop diagram  in particular if many legs and complicated momentum configurations are involved .",
    "one can easily imagine that at two and more loops one arrives quite soon at the limit where the occuring mathematical expressions can not be solved . at two - loop order certain classes of diagrams",
    "can still be treated by either using a combination of analytical simplifications and fast numerical routines , like in the case of two - point function with several non - zero masses  @xcite , or applying purely analytical methods , like in the case of massless digrams with four external legs  @xcite . however , at three - loop order it is essentially only possible to solve one - scale integrals .",
    "a systematic study at four or more loops is still missing .",
    "qcd , the field theoretical realization of the strong interaction , constitutes an important part of the sm and also of most of its extensions . at low energies",
    "the coupling constant of qcd , @xmath10 , is large and perturbative calculations are not possible . however , due to the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom the value of @xmath10 gets smaller with raising energy and perturbation theory is an appropriate tool to evaluate radiative corrections .    up to now",
    "the vast majority of the multi - loop calculations have been performed in the framework of qed and qcd .",
    "one reason is certainly that the calculations are simpler as compared to the full sm since there are less parameters .",
    "furthermore , there is a strong hierarchy both in the quark and lepton masses which also simplifies the calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher - order corrections are indeed necessary . in qed there",
    "exist precise experiments which require high theoretical precision and although the coupling constant is quite small sometimes high loop orders are necessary .",
    "for example , in the case of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron , four - loop corrections are needed to match the experimental precision . in qcd",
    "the coupling is roughly a factor of ten bigger .",
    "nevertheless it is often still small enough to perform a perturbative expansion .",
    "however , the higher order terms are significant and can not be neglected in the cases where high precision is required .    in this work",
    "some recent developments in the calculation of multi - loop diagrams are reviewed .",
    "thereby we will mention the most important methods which have been used in the computation of higher order quantum corrections and explain a few selected ones in greater detail . at the same time",
    ", we discuss the present theoretical status of important physical quantities .",
    "in particular , the renormalization group functions in the modified minimal subtraction scheme  @xcite ( @xmath7 ) are provided up to the four - loop order . as is well - known , four loop running",
    "must be accompanied by three - loop matching at quark thresholds .",
    "the corresponding decoupling relations are presented in section  [ sec : dec ] .",
    "the hadronic higgs decay is closely connected to the decoupling relations as we will show is section  [ sec : dim4 ] .",
    "parts of the quantum corrections can be computed in the framework of an effective lagrangian where the coefficients can be determined from the decoupling relations .",
    "the origin of this miraculous connection lies in the use of the dimension - four operators , which constitute an important ingredient of the effective lagrangian .",
    "another application of the dimension - four operators are the quartic mass corrections to the cross section @xmath11 , which is also discussed in section  [ sec : dim4 ] .",
    "the last issue is again picked up in section  [ sec : pade ] , where also qcd corrections to the production of hadrons in @xmath2 annihilation are computed .",
    "putting together all terms one arrives at a complete picture up to the quartic mass corrections of order @xmath1 .",
    "the main purposes of section  [ sec : pade ] are practical applications of asymptotic expansions for details . ] . besides the diagonal correlators also the non - diagonal ones are considered .",
    "the fermi constant , @xmath6 , the mass of the @xmath8 boson , @xmath12 , and the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath13 , are the best known parameters of the sm .",
    "@xmath12 has been measured at lep with an accuracy of a few per mille to be @xmath14  gev . in this review",
    "we want to discuss quantum corrections to the other two parameters .",
    "an essential ingredient to the running of the electromagnetic coupling from @xmath15 to @xmath16 is provided by the cross section @xmath11 .",
    "the correction terms discussed earlier have been used to obtain so - called theory - driven results .",
    "the different approaches are discussed . as further applications we present the status of the qed corrections to the muon decay and the relation between the @xmath7 and the on - shell quark mass .",
    "let us in the following discuss the individual issues in more detail .",
    "as far as radiative corrections are concerned , a crucial role is played by the renormalization group functions .",
    "in particular the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 governing the running of the coupling and the quark masses comprise a significant part of the higher quantum corrections .",
    "they are in particular very important to re - sum large logarithms to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "only a few years ago the four - loop terms of order @xmath0 have been evaluated for @xmath17  @xcite and @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the latter has been computed by two groups using completely independent methods .",
    "both methods are based on the fact that the pole part of a logarithmically divergent diagram is independent of the masses or momenta . in  @xcite",
    "this is exploited together with the technique of infra - red re - arrangement ( irr ) in order to obtain a factorization of the four - loop integrals into massless three - loop and massive one - loop ones . in refs .",
    "@xcite all lines were assigned to the same mass , and all external momenta were set to zero , which leads to a special class of bubble diagrams . from them",
    "only the pole parts have to be computed . in section  [ sec : rge ] we want to review both methods and explicitly demonstrate the way they work .    in this review special emphasis",
    "is put on the construction of effective theories in the framework of qcd . in section  [ sec : dec ] an effective qcd lagrangian is constructed for the case where one of the quarks is much heavier than the others .",
    "the construction is made explicit by specifying the relations between the parameters in the full and effective theories .",
    "these relations provide at the same time the well - known decoupling constants which have to be applied in qcd every time a particle threshold is crossed .",
    "the most prominent example for their necessity is probably the computation of @xmath19 from @xmath20 or vice versa . in the latter case five",
    "quarks are active whereas in the former one only three quarks are present in the effective qcd lagrangian .    in section  [ sec : dim4 ] a slightly different point of view is adopted . here the scalar operators of dimension four are considered in qcd . in a first step",
    "they are used to construct an effective lagrangian describing the coupling of an intermediate - mass higgs boson to quarks and gluons .",
    "the top quark is considered as heavy and manifests itself in the coefficient functions of the effective lagrangian .",
    "once the latter has been found , the imaginary part of the higgs boson correlator in the effective theory leads to the total decay rate . as a central result of section  [ sec : dim4 ]",
    "we derive a low - energy theorem which considerably simplifies the computation of the coefficient functions as they are related to the decoupling constants of qcd evaluated in section  [ sec : dec ] . in section  [ sub : hggbfm ] the background field method is introduced as a convenient tool for the computation of higher - order corrections . as an example , the coefficient functions describing the decay of the higgs boson into gluons is also computed in this framework .    in the second part of section  [ sec : dim4 ] another important application of the scalar dimension",
    "four operators is discussed , namely the quartic mass corrections to the cross section @xmath11 .",
    "mass corrections of order @xmath21 and @xmath22 are obtained relatively easy as in qcd there are no non - trivial operators of dimension less than four .",
    "however , the quartic corrections require the inclusion of the dimension - four operators with all their renormalization and mixing properties .",
    "we will explain the techniques and present results obtained recently at order @xmath1 .",
    "the last part of this review , section  [ sec : pade ] , is devoted to the discussion of some results obtained with the help of asymptotic expansion accompanied with conformal mapping and pad approximation .",
    "this method has been developed in the recent years and has been applied successfully to a number of important processes .",
    "the underlying idea is the following : only in rare cases it is possible to compute three - loop diagrams involving more than one scale .",
    "however , if a certain hierarchy exists between the scales it is promising to apply an asymptotic expansion .",
    "this effectively reduces the number of scales present in the integrals which are subsequently significantly simplified .",
    "in particular we will discuss the corrections of order @xmath3 to the photon polarization function .",
    "its imaginary part is directly connected to the physical quantity @xmath23 .",
    "the application of our method leads to the full mass dependence . combining the results with the quartic corrections given in section  [ sub : as3m4 ] ,",
    "one obtains a prediction for @xmath24 up to and including @xmath25 .",
    "only recently also the non - diagonal current correlator formed by a massive and a massless quark has been computed . in this application special emphasis lies on the extraction of information about the threshold behaviour which has some relevance in the framework of heavy - quark effective qcd .    as an application of the knowledge of @xmath24 to high perturbative order",
    ", we discuss the evaluation of @xmath26 .",
    "the electromagnetic coupling is defined at vanishing momentum transfer .",
    "however , its evolution to high energies constitutes the dominant part of the radiative corrections to electroweak observables .",
    "the accurate determination of @xmath26 is thus essential for any precise test of the theory . at the same time",
    "the indirect determination of the masses of heavy , hitherto unobserved particles , e.g.  the higgs boson or supersymmertic particles , depends critically on this parameter .",
    "of particular importance in this context is the hadronic vacuum polarization .",
    "it is nearly as large as the leptonic contribution , but can not yet be computed perturbatively .",
    "however , it may be related through dispersion relations to the cross section for hadron production in electron - positron annihilation .",
    "the integrand can thus be obtained from data , phenomenological models and/or perturbative qcd , whenever applicable . in section  [ subsub : delal ]",
    "we will discuss the developments in the evaluation of @xmath26 which took place in the recent two to three years due to the knowledge of the complete mass dependence of @xmath24 at order @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "section  [ subsub : r ] ) .",
    "@xmath6 is defined through the muon lifetime , and the decay of the muon , as a purely leptonic process , is rather clean  both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the one - loop corrections of order @xmath13 were computed more than 40 years ago  @xcite , whereas only recently the two - loop corrections of order @xmath4 have been evaluated  @xcite .",
    "the large gap in time shows that this calculation is highly non - trivial .",
    "the inclusion of the two - loop terms greatly reduced the relative theoretical error of @xmath27 which was an estimate of the size of the missing corrections .",
    "the remaining error on @xmath6 now reads @xmath28 and is of pure experimental nature .",
    "upcoming experiments will further improve the accuracy of the muon lifetime measurement and therefore the @xmath29 corrections to the muon decay are very important and constitute a crucial ingredient from the theoretical side . in section  [ sub :",
    "mudec ] we discuss the results obtained with the help of asymptotic expansion .    in the sm",
    "the quark masses have still relatively big uncertainties .",
    "this is mainly due to the confinement property of qcd which prevents the production of free quarks .",
    "it is also important to have a convenient definition of the quark mass in order to perform a comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "recently there has been quite some activity connected to the precise determination of the bottom- and top - quark masses .",
    "the bottom - quark mass is determined with the help of qcd sum rules where a proper mass definition helps to reduce the error . in the case of the top quark",
    ", studies have been performed for an @xmath2 collider with a center - of - mass energy in the threshold region of top - quark - pair production .",
    "an energy scan which provides the measurement of the total production cross section would provide an error of about 100  mev in the top - quark mass . also here a special mass definition has to be employed . in both cases",
    "the three - loop on - shell@xmath7 conversion formula is needed in order to obtain the corresponding @xmath7 quark mass .",
    "the latter is important for processes not connected to the threshold . in section  [ sub : msos ] these issues are discussed in detail .",
    "in perturbative qcd the renormalization group functions play a very important role . in particular",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 functions governing the running of the strong coupling and the quark masses , respectively , are indispensable when evaluating physical observables .",
    "for this reason we decided to discuss the techniques used for the computation of the four - loop contributions to @xmath30  @xcite and @xmath31  @xcite in more detail .    in the @xmath7 scheme the knowledge of the renormalization group functions is equivalent to the knowledge of the corresponding renormalization constant .",
    "thus , in order to compute a renormalization constant at @xmath32-loop order it is sufficient to evaluate the ultra - violet ( uv ) poles of @xmath32-loop diagrams .",
    "nevertheless it is often also quite useful to have also a handle on the infra - red ( ir ) poles .",
    "more details on the uv and ir structure of feynman diagrams are given in section  [ sub : uvir ] .",
    "afterwards , in sections  [ sub : irr ] and  [ sub : massint ] , two practical methods are described which have been applied at the four - loop level .      before we want to consider explicit examples in the next two sections the theoretical background needed for the higher - loop calculation of renormalization group functions is introduced in this subsection . in particular",
    "we want to demonstrate the interplay between uv and ir divergences in dimensional regularization and show their connection to asymptotic expansions .",
    "we refrain from presenting the material in a mathematical rigorous framework , for which we refer to the original literature , but exemplify the important points at explicit diagrams .",
    "as the properties discussed in this section are independent of the particle type we consider only scalar propagators of the form @xmath33 where also @xmath34 is allowed .",
    "we furthermore assume that the integration momenta are denoted by @xmath35 and introduce the abbreviation @xmath36 .    in order to remove the uv divergences",
    "the so - called @xmath37 operation has been introduced  @xcite .",
    "it is a recursive subtraction scheme where the uv divergences are removed from the feynman integrals in a way compatible to adding local counterterms to the lagrangian .",
    "formally , the @xmath37 operation can be written as a sum where each term is a product of operators acting on subsets of disjoint one - particle - irreducible subgraphs . in this way",
    "counterterms are generated .",
    "they have to be inserted into the vertices of the diagrams which remain after shrinking the corresponding subgraphs to a point .",
    "non - trivial diagrammatic examples can , e.g. , be found in the text books  @xcite .",

    "we want to stress that the main simplification , which is common to all kinds of asymtotic expansions , comes from the fact that the expansions in the small parameters are done before any momentum integration is performed .",
    "the proof that this leads to correct results is based on the so - called strategy of regions  @xcite . there",
    "different regions of each loop momentum are selected and in each of them taylor expansions with respect to the small parameters are performed . in the limits of the hard - mass and large - momentum procedures",
    "an interpretation of the different regions in terms subgraphs and cosub - graphs is possible ( see above ) .",
    "this is different in the case of the threshold expansion  @xcite where a graphical representation becomes much less transparent .",
    "however , the application of the strategy of regions  @xcite leads to correct results .",
    "the problem of evaluating one - loop feynman diagrams is  at least in principle  solved ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "however , in case many legs and lots of different masses appear also one - loop computations can become very tedious , in particular if degenerate momentum configurations are involved .    at two - loop order",
    "the class of feynman diagrams which have been studied in detail is much more restricted .",
    "there is a good understanding of two - point functions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) which also has found important physical applications  @xcite . concerning three- and four - point functions one",
    "is essentially restricted to the massless case . in this context",
    "we want to draw the attention to the recent activity in the computation of the two - loop box diagrams ( for a brief overview see  @xcite ) . within the last two years",
    "the basis has been established to compute two - loop virtual corrections to the four - point feynman amplitudes where all internal lines are massless and at most one external leg is off - shell .",
    "this opens the door to investigate next - to - next - to - leading order processes like the two - jet production at hadron colliders or three - jet production in @xmath2 annihilation .",
    "it is obvious that the complexity of the computation of a feynman diagram strongly depends on the number of different scales involved .",
    "there is one class of diagrams which is studied in great detail up to three loops , namely diagrams which only depend on one dimensionful scale .",
    "next to massless propagator - type diagrams with one external momentum , @xmath38 , we have in mind vacuum integrals with one non - zero mass , @xmath55 and so - called on - shell integrals for which the condition @xmath56 is fulfilled .",
    "the basic idea for the computation of the integrals is common to all three types : after the numerator is decomposed in terms of the denominator recurrence relations are applied which express the diagram as a linear combination of so - called master integrals . only for the latter",
    "a hard computation is necessary .",
    "however , since in the case of single - scale diagrams the master integrals are essentially pure numbers it is also possible to use high - precision numerical methods in case an analytical calculation is not possible .",
    "we want to mention that for the massless propagator - type and the massive vacuum integrals two and nine master integrals are needed , respectively . in the case of the three - loop on - shell integrals a list of all master integrals",
    "can be found in the appendix of ref .",
    "counting also those integrals which are composed of products of lower - order diagrams they amount to 18 .    for convenience",
    "we want to provide the analytical results for the massless one - loop two - point functions , @xmath57 , the on - shell two - point functions , @xmath58 , and the one- ( @xmath59 ) and two - loop ( @xmath60 ) vacuum integrals in euclidian space .",
    "@xmath61    the results of a general three - loop diagram can not be expressed in terms of @xmath62 functions . moreover , due to the large number of contributing diagrams and the complexity of intermediate expressions it is absolutely necessary to use computer algebra programs for the computation of multi - loop diagrams .",
    "it is thus also hardly possible to provide intermediate results which eventually could be used in other calculations .",

    "we briefly want to mention the program packages which have been used to obtain most of the results discussed in this review . for a general overview concerning the automation of feynman diagram computation we refer to  @xcite .    the large number of diagrams which occurs in particular if one considers higher loop orders makes it necessary to generate the diagrams automatically .",
    "the fortran program qgraf  @xcite provides the possiblility to implement own models in a simple way .",
    "furthermore it is quite fast and generates several thousand diagrams in a few seconds .",
    "one of the disadvantages of qgraf is that the user has to put the feynman rules himself . on the other hand",
    ", this provides quite some flexibility in the choices of the vertices .",
    "e.g. , it is straightforward to implement the vertex involving the coupling of the operator @xmath77 to four gluons ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : op1 ] ) ) .    in general",
    ", the application of asymptotic expansions , in particular if serveral of them are applied successively , generates many subdiagram which have to be expanded in several small quantities . even for a single multi - loop diagram",
    "this becomes very tedious if it has to be performed by hand .",
    "for this reason the programs lmp  @xcite and exp  @xcite have been developed .",
    "lmp was especially developed in order to apply the large - momentum procedure to the diagonal current correlators  @xcite . in some sense exp",
    "can be considered as the successor of lmp .",
    "next to the hard - mass procedure also the succesive application of large - mometum and/or hard - mass procedure is possible .",
    "this broadens the area of applications .",
    "here we just want to mention as examples the correction of @xmath78 to the @xmath8 boson decay  @xcite , @xmath79 corrections to the top quark decay  @xcite or two - loop qed corrections to the muon decay  @xcite ( cf .",
    "section  [ sub : mudec ] ) .",
    "the very computation of the integrals is performed with the program packages mincer  @xcite and matad  @xcite ( see appendix  [ sub : single ] ) .",
    "the former deals with massless propagator - type integrals up to three loops and matad was written to deal with vacuum diagrams at one- , two- and three - loop order where several of the internal lines may have a common mass .",
    "the area of application for each of the individual packages seems to be quite restrictive .",
    "however , in particular the combined application offers a quite flexible use .    in order to handle problems where a large number of diagrams are involved and where eventually an asymptotic expansion has to be applied in a convenient way the program package geficom has been written . a very limited number of small input files allows the user to rule the flow of the computation .",
    "qgraf is called to generate the diagrams .",
    "a mathematica  @xcite script determines the toplogy of each individual diagram and provides input which either can be directly read from mincer and/or matad or can be passed to exp or lmp . at the end the results of the individual diagrams are summed and the bare result is stored . moreover a convenient environment is provided which , e.g. , makes sure that all result files are up - to - date .",

    "<S> in this review some recent multi - loop results obtained in the framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) are discussed . after reviewing the most advanced techniques used for the computation of renormalization group functions , we consider the decoupling of heavy quarks . in particular , an effective method for the evaluation of the decoupling constants is presented and explicit results are given . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the connection to observables involving a scalar higgs boson is worked out in detail . </S>",
    "<S> an all - order low energy theorem is derived which establishes a relation between the coefficient functions in the hadronic higgs decay and the decoupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> we review the radiative corrections of a higgs boson into gluons and quarks and present explicit results up to order @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . in this review special emphasis </S>",
    "<S> is put on the applications of asymptotic expansions . </S>",
    "<S> a method is described which combines expansion terms of different kinematical regions with the help of conformal mapping and pad approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this method allows us to proceed beyond the present scope of exact multi - loop calculations . as far as physical processes are concerned , we review the computation of three - loop current correlators in qcd taking into account the full mass - dependence . in particular , we concentrate on the evaluation of the total cross section for the production of hadrons in @xmath2 annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of the complete mass dependence at order @xmath3 has triggered a bunch of theory - driven analyses of the hadronic contribution to the electromagnetic coupling evaluated at high energy scales . </S>",
    "<S> the status is summarized in this review . in a further application four - loop diagrams </S>",
    "<S> are considered which contribute to the order @xmath4 qed corrections to the @xmath5 decay . </S>",
    "<S> its relevance for the determination of the fermi constant @xmath6 is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> finally the calculation of the three - loop relation between the @xmath7 and on - shell quark mass definitions is presented and physical applications are given . to complete the presentation , </S>",
    "<S> some technical details are presented in the appendix , where also explicit analytical results are listed .    </S>",
