    "this parameter limits momentum transfers in effective interactions .",
    "therefore , and if the renormalization group equations for @xmath4 can be solved to a reasonable accuracy using a series expansion in powers of an effective coupling constant , @xmath0 , and if @xmath2 is brought that way down to scales on the order of hadronic masses , a finite computer code has a chance to find solutions to eq .",

    "questions concerning the ground state structure , such as symmetry breaking , should in principle be answerable by introducing new hamiltonian counterterms that remove dependence of the spectrum and other observables on the infinitesimally small cutoff parameter @xmath5 that limits the constituents longitudinal momenta , @xmath6 , from below .",
    "alternatively , the lower bound can also be introduced through factors @xmath7 that suppress interactions whenever fractions @xmath8 are smaller than a minuscule dimensionless parameter @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the total momentum carried by particles that a hamiltonian term annihilates or creates .",
    "each and every interaction may have different @xmath10 and by using the ratio @xmath11 one can preserve explicit boost invariance in the renormalization group equations for @xmath4 .",
    "the latter are derived from the relation @xmath12 that changes the original creation ( as well as annihilation ) operators from the canonical theory , @xmath13 , to the creation operators for effective particles that are denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the renormalization group parameter @xmath2 has interpretation of the inverse size of effective gluons , because all interaction vertices in @xmath4 contain form factors , @xmath15 , with momentum width @xmath2 .",

    "the function @xmath40 depends on the regulating factors that were inserted in the canonical hamiltonian of qcd to suppress the region of small longitudinal momentum fractions , and @xmath41 converges pointwise to 1 when @xmath9 is sent to 0 .",
    "the hamiltonian gluon coupling strength @xmath42 of eq.([v ] ) , depends on @xmath11 through @xmath43 and the latter depends on the initial hamiltonian and small-@xmath11 regularization factor @xmath44 .",

    "the sharp cutoff case b ) is visibly different from c ) that produces @xmath51 for @xmath52 , but the continuous case a ) differs from c ) only by 8% .",
    "the case c ) with @xmath53 corresponds to the standard asymptotic freedom result  @xcite in the sense that it leads to @xmath54 with @xmath55 which is equal to the @xmath56-function coefficient in feynman calculus in qcd .",
    "thus , if one equates the hamiltonian form factor width @xmath2 with the running momentum scale in feynman diagrams , the standard result from off - shell @xmath57-matrix calculus would be recovered in effective hamiltonians if @xmath53 , cf .",

    "this result explains that asymptotic freedom of effective gluons is a consequence of that a single effective gluon contains a pair of bare gluons .",
    "this component amplifies the strength with which effective gluons split into effective gluons when @xmath2 gets smaller .",
    "the fact that such running coupling constant appears in the renormalized hamiltonians with small cutoffs , explains also why it is possible that a running coupling in the scattering processes provides a good approximation to physics .",
    "namely , in perturbative description of processes characterized by a physical momentum scale @xmath58 , using @xmath59 , there will appear powers of @xmath0 and @xmath60 . for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , so that the theoretical predictions will have a power expansion in the asymptotically free running coupling constant @xmath63 .",
    "one can trace the origin of why the factor @xmath64 in lf qcd hamiltonians provides a connection with the covariant lagrangian calculus to the success of dimensional regularization in evaluating feynman diagrams : the parameter @xmath9 is analogous to the deviation of the number of dimensions from 4 .",
    "although the ultraviolet hamiltonian counterterms in canonical lf qcd are much more complicated @xcite than in the lagrangian calculus , @xmath64 avoids the anomalous @xmath43 in the effective gluon vertex in small-@xmath2 hamiltonians once the latter are already made insensitive to the ultraviolet regularization via renormalization group .",
