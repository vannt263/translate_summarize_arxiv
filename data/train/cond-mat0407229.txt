    "@xcite , the characteristic feature of the superfluid phase appeared in the interference pattern in the absorption image of the atomic cloud after ballistic expansion , which is due to the coherence of the bose condensed atoms .",
    "the phase transition to the mott insulator phase was signaled by the disappearance of the interference pattern .",
    "however , it is not obvious how one can precisely identify the transition point from the interference visibility .",
    "moreover , recent papers by roth and burnett  @xcite argue that the interference pattern contains only the information on the quasi - momentum distribution of the lattice system , but has no direct information on the superfluid fraction .",
    "therefore the disappearance of the interference pattern does not provide direct proof of the mott transition  @xcite . on the other hand , in the mott insulator phase",

    ", we propose to use an output coupling current as a more direct probe for detecting the mott gap of a bose gas in an optical lattice .",
    "recent papers  @xcite discussed the output coupling current from the trapped atoms at finite temperature , and pointed out that the analysis of the output current serves as a probe of many - body states of a trapped gas . in particular , luxat and griffin  @xcite developed a general formalism of the output coupling current by using the linear response theory . their formalism is useful because one only has to concentrate on calculating single - particle correlation functions of the system of interest . in this paper , we calculate the output coupling current from a bose gas in an optical lattice in the mott insulator phase , and explicitly show how the characteristic feature of single - particle excitations appears in the energy spectrum of the output - coupling current .",
    "to describe a bose gas in an optical lattice , we use a bose - hubbard model  @xcite .",

    "the poles of this green s function provide dispersion relations of particle and hole excitations .",
    "these dispersion relations exhibit an energy gap , which vanishes at a critical point and grows with increasing on - site interaction as well as with increasing temperature .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the single - particle excitations in a bose gas in an optical lattice .",
    "we calculated the single - particle green s functions of the bose - hubbard model in the mott insulator phase by using the standard basis operator formalism whose poles provide the dispersion relations of particle and hole excitations .",
    "these dispersion relations show that the energy gap between the particle and hole excitations at @xmath143 vanishes at the critical point .",
    "the energy gap increases with the increasing temperature or increasing @xmath144 . the same behavior of the energy gap has also been found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in order to gain information of the single - particle excitations in the mott phase ,",
    "we have calculated the output coupling current using the linear - response formalism given by luxat and griffin  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the momentum - resolved current has two distinct contributions from the particle and hole excitations , and thus one can directly measure the mott gap . moreover , this can be used to detect the transition point from the mott insulator phase to the superfluid phase , where the mott gap vanishes .",
    "we note that the contribution from the particle excitations is strongly temperature dependent , vanishing at @xmath37 . in most cases",
    "the particle - excitation contribution is much smaller than the hole - excitation contribution .",
    "nevertheless we expect the particle - excitation peak to be experimentally observable since it is distinct from the hole peak , as shown in fig.[fig : current - u ] .    in the present work",
    "we have restricted our calculations to the mott insulator phase .",
    "it is next important to study how the output current changes as we enter the superfluid phase . in the superfluid phase , we expect to have a direct tunneling current from the condensate component , as well as processes involving quasi - particle excitations  @xcite .",
    "extending the present study to the superfluid phase will be given in a future work .    finally , we mention the recent experiment by stferle _",
    "et al_.@xcite investigating excitations in a trapped bose gas in an optical lattice using the bragg spectroscopy .",
    "this type of experiment deals with the density - fluctuation spectrum  @xcite .",
