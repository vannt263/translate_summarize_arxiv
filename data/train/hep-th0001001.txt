    "one of the most basic properties one may study about a class of string compactifications is its moduli space of vacua .",
    "if the class is suitably chosen one may find this a challenging subject which probes deeply into our understanding of string theory . in four dimensions it is the @xmath0 cases which provide the `` goldilocks '' theories to study .",
    "as we will see , @xmath3 supersymmetry is too constraining and determines the moduli space exactly , leaving no room for interesting corrections from quantum effects .",
    "@xmath4 supersymmetry is highly unconstrained leaving the possibility that our supposed moduli acquire mass ruining the moduli space completely .",
    "@xmath0 however is _ just right _  quantum effects are not potent enough to kill the moduli but they can affect the structure of the moduli space .",
    "( it is therefore a pity that the real world does not have @xmath0 supersymmetry  such a theory is necessarily non - chiral . )",
    "the subject of @xmath0 compactifications is enormous and we will present here only a rather biased set of highlights .",
    "these lectures will be sometimes closely - related to a set of lectures i gave at tasi 3 years ago @xcite .",
    "having said that , the focus of these lectures differs from the former and the set of topics covered is not identical .",
    "i will however often refer to @xcite for details of certain subjects .",
    "related to the problem of finding the moduli space of a class of theories is the following problem in string duality .",
    "consider these four possibilities for obtaining an @xmath0 theory in four dimensions :    1 .",
    "a type iia string compactified on a  threefold @xmath5 .",
    "a type iib string compactified on a  threefold @xmath6 .",
    "an @xmath7 heterotic string compactified on k3@xmath1 .",
    "a @xmath8 heterotic string compactified on k3@xmath1 .",
    "can we find cases where the resulting 4 dimensional physics is identical for two or more of these possibilities and , if so , how do we match the moduli of these theories to each other ? this is a story that began with @xcite some time ago but many details are poorly - understood to this day .",
    "one might suppose that knowing the moduli space of each theory listed above is a prerequisite for solving this problem but actually it is often useful , as we will see , to consider this duality problem at the same time as the moduli space problem .",
    "note that there are other possibilities for producing @xmath0 theories in four dimensions such as the type i open string on k3@xmath1",
    ". we will stick with the four listed above in these lectures as they are quite sufficient for our purposes .",
    "as will be discussed shortly this problem breaks up into two pieces .",
    "one factor of the moduli space consists of the vector multiplet moduli space and the other factor consists of the hypermultiplet moduli space . by most criteria",
    "the moduli space of vector multiplets is well - understood today .",
    "this complex khler space can be modeled exactly in terms of the deformation space of a  threefold .",
    "we will therefore be able to review this subject fairly extensively .",
    "in contrast the hypermultiplet moduli space remains a subject of research very much `` in progress '' .",
    "we will only be able to discuss in detail the classical boundaries of these moduli spaces .",
    "the interior of these spaces may offer considerable insight into string theory but we will only be able to cover some tantalizing hints of such possibilities .",
    "these lectures divide naturally into three sections . in section [",
    "s : gen ] we discuss generalities about moduli spaces of various numbers of supersymmetries in various numbers of dimensions .",
    "although these lectures are intended to focus on the case of @xmath0 in four dimensions , there are highly relevant observations that can be made by considering other possibilities .",
    "of particular note in this section is the rigid structure which emerges with more supersymmetry than the case in question .",
    "the heart of these lectures then consists of a discussion of the vector multiplet moduli space in section  [ s : vec ] and then the hypermultiplet moduli space in section  [ s : hyp ] .",
    "it is perhaps worth mentioning again that these lectures do not do justice to this vast subject and should be viewed as a biased account .",
    "topic such as open strings , d - branes and m - theory have been neglected only because of the author s groundless prejudices .",
    "the paragraphs starting with a `` '' are technical and can be skipped if the reader does not wish to be embroiled in subtleties .",
    "we begin this section with a well - known derivation of key properties of moduli spaces based on @xmath9-symmetries and holonomy arguments .",
    "we should warn the more mathematically - inclined reader that we shall not endeavour to make completely watertight rigorous statements in the following . there may be a few pathological special cases which circumvent some of our ( possibly implicit ) assumptions .",
    "suppose we are given a vector bundle , @xmath10 , with a connection .",
    "we may define the `` holonomy '' , @xmath11 , of this bundle as the group generated by parallel transport around loops in the base with respect to this connection .",
    "( a choice of basepoint is unimportant . )",
    "we may also define the _ restricted _ holonomy group @xmath12 to be generated by _",
    "contractable _ loops",
    ".    this notion can be very useful when applied to supersymmetric field theories as noted in @xcite .",
    "first let us consider the moduli space of a given class of theories .",
    "we will consider the moduli space as the base space of a bundle .",
    "note that the moduli space of theories , @xmath13 , is equipped with a natural metric  that of the sigma - model .",
    "the tangent directions in the moduli space are given by the massless scalar fields with completely flat potentials .",
    "these massless fields may thus be given vacuum expectation values leading to a deformation of the theory .",
    "let us denote these moduli fields @xmath14 , @xmath15 . the low - energy effective action in the uncompactified space - time",
    "is then given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is our desired metric on @xmath13 .",
    "we therefore have a natural torsion - free connection on the tangent bundle of @xmath13 given by the levi - civita connection with respect to this metric .",
    "now consider the supersymmetry generators given by spinors @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where as usual @xmath20 denotes the number of supersymmetries ( we suppress the spinor index ) .",
    "these objects are representations of @xmath21 and are    * _ real _ if @xmath22 * _ complex _ if @xmath23 * _ quaternionic _ ( or _ symplectic majorana _ ) if @xmath24",
    ".    the bundle of supersymmetry generators over @xmath13 will also have a natural connection related to that on the tangent bundle .",
    "the key relation in supersymmetry is the equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the usual gamma matrices , @xmath27 is translation and the bars in this equation are to be interpreted according to whether the spinors are real , complex or quaternionic . because parallel transport must preserve @xmath28 in ( [ eq : susy ] ) we see immediately that under holonomy @xmath18 must transform as a fundamental representation of    * @xmath29 if @xmath22 * @xmath30 if @xmath23 * @xmath31 if @xmath24 ,    if the loop around which we transport is contractable .",
    "these groups are the `` @xmath9-symmetries '' of the supersymmetric field theories and give @xmath32 of this bundle .",
    "we also note that in @xmath33 dimensions , for integer @xmath34 , the supersymmetries are chiral .",
    "this means that we consider left and right supersymmetries separately as we will illustrate in some examples below .",
    "the massless scalar fields live in supermultiplets . within each supermultiplet",
    "the set of scalar fields will form a particular ( possibly trivial ) representation of the @xmath9-symmetry .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed account of this .",
    "occasionally the supermultiplet contains only one scalar component and this then transforms trivially under @xmath9 .",
    "so long as this is not the case the holonomy of our tangent bundle is related to the @xmath9-symmetry .    we may be more precise than this .",
    "as we go around a loop in @xmath13 the scalars within every given supermultiplet will be mixed simultaneously by the @xmath9-symmetry . the supermultiplets themselves",
    "may also be mixed as a whole into each other by holonomy .",
    "this implies that , so long as the scalars transform nontrivially under @xmath9 , _ the holonomy of the tangent bundle is factorized with the @xmath9-symmetry forming one factor .",
    "_ it is important to note however that we may not mix a scalar from one supermultiplet freely with any scalar from another supermultiplet in a way that violates this factorization .",
    "this is incompatible with the detailed supersymmetry transformation laws ( as the reader might verify if they are unconvinced ) .",
    "note in particular that the scalars within two different _ types _ of supermultiplets can never mix under holonomy .",
    "this is a useful observation given the following due to de rham ( see , for example , @xcite )    if a riemannian manifold is complete , simply connected and if the holonomy of its tangent bundle with respect to the levi - civita connection is reducible , then this manifold is a product metrically .",
    "thus if @xmath13 is simply - connected we see that @xmath13 factorizes exactly into parts labelled by the type of supermultiplet containing the massless scalars .",
    "if @xmath13 is not simply - connected we may pass to the universal cover and use this theorem again .",
    "the general statement is therefore that the moduli space factorizes up to the quotient of a discrete group acting on the product .",
    "actually we should treat the word `` complete '' in the above theorem with a little more care .",
    "there are nasty points at finite distance in the moduli space where the manifold structure breaks down .",
    "these points also lead to a breakdown in the factorization of the moduli space .",
    "these extremal transitions will be studied more in section  [ ss : ex ] .",
    "we should only say that the moduli space factorizes locally away from such points .",
    "we may now analyze the structure of each factor of @xmath13 from the berger - simons theorem ( for an account of this we refer again to @xcite ) which states that the manifold must appear as a row in the following list : means @xmath35 divided by the diagonal central @xmath36 . ]",
    "@xmath37 or be a `` symmetric space '' ( which we will define shortly ) .",
    "note that the following names are given to some of these holonomies :    * _ khler _ if @xmath38 , * _ ricci - flat khler _ if @xmath39 , * _ quaternionic khler _ if @xmath40 , * _ hyperkhler _ if @xmath41 .",
    ".symmetric spaces [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     upon compactification on a space @xmath5 to flat @xmath42-dimensional spacetime we obtain the spacetime effective action @xmath43 from ( [ eq : qft ] ) where @xmath14 are coordinates on the moduli space as in ( [ eq : mod ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath44 represents the effective @xmath42-dimensional dilaton and is given basically by @xmath45 . in the compactification scenario _ this field theory is declared to be accurate_. because this part of spacetime is flat minkowski space ( or very nearly ) we assert that worldsheet instantons are not allowed to spoil this field theory .",
    "this assumption is implicit in all of these lectures .",
    "of course , this means that we are not allowed to ask questions about the @xmath42-dimensional physics which might probe effects such as quantum gravity .",
    "then the compactification model would be invalid .",
    "in order to discuss quantum corrections we need to establish limits on how much we are allowed to warp the moduli spaces consistent with the supersymmetry .",
    "we have said that @xmath46 is khler and we can now put further limits on the structure of this moduli space .",
    "we wish to exploit the fact that the moduli space factor @xmath46 for the type iib string compactified on a  space @xmath6 is not warped at all by quantum corrections .",
    "the fact that @xmath46 is given exactly in the form of a moduli space of complex structures on a  threefold will allow us to ask more detailed questions about the differential geometry of @xmath46 .",
    "the deformations of complex structure of @xmath6 are best thought of as _ variations of hodge structure _ as we now explain .",
    "any threefold has hodge numbers @xmath47 in the form of a hodge diamond @xmath48{\\multicolumn{2}{c}{#1 } } \\arraycolsep=7pt \\begin{array}{*8{c } }      & & & \\m1 & & & \\\\ & & \\m0&\\m0 & & \\\\ & \\m0&\\m{h^{1,1}}&\\m0 & \\\\",
    "\\m1&\\m{h^{2,1}}&\\m{h^{2,1}}&\\m1 \\\\ & \\m0&\\m{h^{1,1}}&\\m0 & \\\\      & & \\m0&\\m0 & & \\\\ & & & \\m1 & & & \\end{array}\\ ] ] of interest to us is the middle row of this diamond which relates to @xmath49 .",
    "in particular we have a relationship between the dolbeault cohomology groups and the integral cohomology : @xmath50 as we vary the complex structure the way in which the lattice @xmath51 embeds itself into the space @xmath52 `` rotates '' with respect to the decomposition of @xmath52 into the dolbeault cohomology groups .",
    "consider a holomorphic 3-form @xmath53 .",
    "this is never zero anywhere on @xmath6 and is uniquely defined up to a constant multiple thanks to the  condition .",
    "now consider a symplectic basis for @xmath54 given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 with intersections @xmath58 .",
    "define the _ periods _",
    "these periods `` measure '' the complex structure of @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath6 has only @xmath60 deformations of complex structure it is clear that not all of these periods may be independent .",
    "firstly we have noted that @xmath61 is defined only up to a constant multiple so the periods can at best only be homogeneous coordinates in a projective space .",
    "secondly it was shown by bryant and griffiths @xcite that , given all the @xmath62 s , all the @xmath63 s are determined .",
    "that is , we may express the @xmath63 s as functions of the @xmath62 s .",
    "thus we are locally modeling the moduli space by @xmath64 .",
    "this gives us the correct dimension for the moduli space .",
    "( note that the topology of the moduli space is unlikely to be that of a projective space as we have ignored the subtleties of degenerations so far .",
    "also , the metric on the moduli space will not be the fubini - study metric .",
    "one way of seeing this is that some degenerations will be an infinite distance away from generic points in the moduli space . )",
    "it is then not hard to show , see for example section 3 of @xcite , that we may define a function @xmath65 locally on the moduli space such that @xmath66    we may rephrase this more globally in terms of bundle language following strominger @xcite .",
    "the moduli space @xmath46 has an `` ample '' line bundle @xmath67 such that @xmath68 is given by the cohomology class of the khler form on @xmath46 .",
    "we also have an @xmath69-bundle @xmath70 over @xmath46 whose fibre is given by @xmath52 in the fundamental representation .",
    "we then have sections @xmath71    the important point is that the function @xmath65 , which is called the `` prepotential '' contains all the useful information we will need .",
    "the geometry of @xmath46 is completely determined by it .",
    "this fact shows that @xmath46 can not be any old khler manifold .",
    "it is conventional to denote the special property that we have a prepotential by saying that @xmath46 is `` special khler '' .",
    "our discussion above takes the point of view that special khler geometry appears from the moduli space of complex structure on threefolds .",
    "this is not the original definition however .",
    "special khler was first used to denote the geometry of the moduli space of scalar fields in vector multiplets of arbitrary @xmath0 supersymmetric field theories coupled to gravity in four dimensions as in @xcite . in this context ,",
    "the projective coordinates @xmath62 are known as `` special '' or `` flat '' coordinates .",
    "the link between these points of view is that the khler metric on @xmath46 given in the effective action ( [ eq : qftd ] ) is given by @xmath72    the remarkable fact , as proved by strominger in @xcite ( see also a discussion of this in @xcite ) , is that these points of view are equivalent .",
    "that is to say _ the local conditions arising from differential geometry for deformations of hodge structure of a  threefold are identical to the conditions on the moduli space of vector moduli in an @xmath0 theory of supergravity in four dimensions .",
    "_    it is well worth pausing to reflect on the implications of this statement .",
    "since we have approached the question of supergravity in lower dimensions from the point of view of string theorists this statement may not seem particularly stunning  it is just a confirmation that things are working out nicely .",
    "our moduli space of compact  manifolds ties in nicely with the geometry of the moduli space of vacuum expectation values of the massless scalar particles in the uncompactified dimensions .",
    "this statement of equivalence does not depend on string theory however .",
    "what would we have made of it if we had not yet discovered string theory ?",
    "it is as if the @xmath0 theories of supergravity in four dimensions `` knew '' that they were related in some way the  threefolds .",
    "string theory , or at least ten - dimensional supergravity , provides this link nicely via compactification .",
    "even if string theory turns out to be wrong for some reason , this link between @xmath0 theories and  threefolds is irrefutable .",
    "we should provide a word of caution about the strength of the statements above .",
    "just because a moduli space is consistent with these conditions that it be a deformation of hodge structure of a manifold , it does not imply that such a  manifold must exist .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile to mention the following structure about special khler geometry which gives a hint as to why the @xmath0 theory `` knows '' about the  3-fold .",
    "consider the following hermitian form on @xmath52 : @xmath73 it is easy to show ( see @xcite for example ) that the imaginary part of this form coincides with the usual cup product structure when restricted to @xmath51 .",
    "one may also show that    * on @xmath74 the form @xmath75 is negative definite , and * on @xmath76 the form @xmath75 is positive definite .",
    "one may show @xcite that this is reflected in the fact that the the matrix @xmath77 has signature @xmath78 .",
    "this signature nicely `` separates '' the @xmath79 part of the cohomology from the @xmath80 part",
    ".    we can now argue ( very ) roughly as follows .",
    "if we had an even number of dimensions to our compact space then we would nt have the right symplectic structure ( e.g. the @xmath69 group above ) on the middle dimension cohomology to see the correct variation of hodge structure .",
    "if the compact space were complex dimension one , we would nt have `` enough room '' in the hodge diamond for an indefinite hermitian form . if we had five or more complex compact directions we would expect something more complicated .",
    "thus three dimensions is the most natural .",
    "we also obtain @xmath81 from the signature telling us that we must have a ! and @xmath82 which might give us the right structure .",
    "we consider this less natural than the  threefold . ]",
    "we would like to emphasize again the fact that this discussion of special khler geometry depends on the exactness of the effective action ( [ eq : qftd ] ) .",
    "if true quantum gravity effects in four dimensions are considered we may expect much of this discussion to break down .",
    "indeed , the statement that we have a moduli space in the form of a riemannian manifold ( or orbifold etc . )",
    "would then be suspect .",
    "now we wish to look at the way that @xmath46 is seen in the type iia string on the  threefold @xmath5 .",
    "this involves the old work of _ mirror symmetry .",
    "_ since there have been numerous reviews of mirror symmetry we will be fairly brief here and focus only the warping of the special geometry of @xmath46 .",
    "as noted in section [ ss : who ] @xmath46 consists of the moduli space of the khler form on @xmath5 but is subject to corrections coming from worldsheet instantons .",
    "let us first establish what it would look like if there were no quantum corrections .",
    "one may approach this directly as in @xcite or one may proceed in a slightly different way via m - theory .",
    "we will do the latter ( as most string theory students these days are perhaps even better acquainted with m - theory than with string theory ! ) .",
    "the first thing to note is that an @xmath0 theory in four dimensions may be obtained by compactifying an @xmath4 theory in _ five _ dimensions on a circle .",
    "then if we reinterpret the iia string theory as m - theory on a circle we see that this five - dimensional theory may be obtained by compactifying m - theory on the  threefold @xmath5 .    to put it another way we may consider the limit of a type iia string on @xmath5 as the string coupling becomes very strong . in the same way that the ten - dimensional type iia string becomes eleven - dimensional m - theory in this limit , the four dimensional @xmath0 theory will turn into the five - dimensional @xmath4 theory .",
    "the useful thing about this limit for our purposes is that the effective string scale given by @xmath83 tends to zero in this limit .",
    "thus stringy effects such as worldsheet instantons are completely suppressed .",
    "this is explained nicely by witten @xcite .",
    "the general idea is that the metric in the uncompactified directions needs to be rescaled as we change dimension ( just as it is going from ten dimensions to eleven dimensions @xcite ) .",
    "this rescaling is infinite taking the string scale to zero size .",
    "a vector multiplet in five dimensions contains only one real scalar as opposed to the two scalars coming from the four dimensional vector multiplet .",
    "the rescaling between the type iia theory and m - theory also causes a slight reshuffling of moduli as explained in @xcite .",
    "the result is that we have a moduli space @xmath84 of vector multiplets which is a real space of dimension @xmath85 .",
    "this is the classical moduli space of cohomology classes khler forms on @xmath5 _ of fixed volume . _",
    "the deformation corresponding to the volume defects to the hypermultiplets replacing the lost dilaton leaving the moduli space @xmath86 unchanged between four and five dimensions .",
    "the compactification of m - theory on a smooth  threefold yields @xmath87 vector fields from the m - theory 3-form in eleven dimensions .",
    "this yields a supersymmetric @xmath88 gauge theory ( with gravity ) in five dimensions .",
    "the action for such a field theory contains the interesting `` chern - simons''-like term @xmath89 where @xmath90 is symmetric in its indices @xmath91 . as usual with these topological types of terms in field theory one may compute @xmath90 from the intersection theory of @xmath5 . in this case one",
    "discovers that @xmath92 where the @xmath93 s are the generators of ( the free part of ) @xmath94 .",
    "equivalently we may use 4-cycles @xmath95 in @xmath96 dual to @xmath93 and obtain intersection numbers : @xmath97    furthermore , as explained in @xcite , we may put homogeneous coordinates @xmath98 on @xmath84 such that the metric is given by @xmath99 this should be regarded as the `` special '' real geometry of @xmath84 where the `` prepotential '' is given by a pure cubic @xmath100 .",
    "relationships of this to jordan algebras are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we may instead regard @xmath98 as the _ affine _ coordinates in @xmath101 .",
    "the khler form is then given by @xmath102 and the condition that we fix the volume to , say one , for @xmath84 , is given by @xmath103 this latter condition can also be seen directly from supergravity without reference to the geometrical interpretation of @xmath5 as in @xcite .",
    "thus again we see strong hints that five dimensional @xmath4 supergravity `` knows '' that it has something to do with khler threefolds even without direct reference to m - theory .",
    "note that the moduli space @xmath84 is not the complete hypersurface @xmath104 in @xmath105 .",
    "it turns out that phase transitions occur precisely on the walls of the khler cone to truncate this hypersurface to lie completely within the khler cone .",
    "this is discussed in @xcite for example but we will not pursue it here",
    ".    we may now perform crude dimensional reduction of this five - dimensional field theory to render it a four - dimensional theory .",
    "recall that dimensional reduction simply asserts that the fields have no dependence on motion in the directions we wish to lose and we decompose the vectors , tensors , etc accordingly into lower - dimensional objects .    performing this operation",
    "is a lengthy operation but the result for the moduli space is straight - forward .",
    "as required , we obtain special khler geometry for @xmath46 in four dimensions .",
    "now we have _ complex _ homogeneous coordinates @xmath106 , where @xmath107 still runs @xmath108 and a",
    "prepotential @xmath109    the very important point to realize however is that dimensional reduction is _ not _ necessarily the same thing as compactification on a circle ( as emphasized in @xcite for example ) .",
    "the problem is that solitons present in the five - dimensional theory can become instantons in the four dimensional theory and add quantum corrections to the picture .",
    "we may only regard ( [ eq : f0 ] ) as the classical contribution to the prepotential .",
    "we may expect quantum corrections to appear with respect to @xmath83 as noted earlier .",
    "note that ( [ eq : f0 ] ) may be computed as the classical contribution directly without a foray into five dimensional physics @xcite .",
    "the five dimensional picture is probably worth being aware of however as it offers many insights .",
    "the easiest way of computing the quantum corrections to the prepotential of the type iia string compactified on @xmath5 is to use a duality argument in the form of mirror symmetry .",
    "that is , can we find a  threefold @xmath6 such that the type iib string compactified on @xmath6 yields the same physics in four dimensions as the type iia string compactified on @xmath5 ?",
    "if this is the case @xmath5 and @xmath6 are said to be `` mirror ''  threefolds . given the current state of our knowledge of string theory it is probably not possible to rigorously prove that any such pairs @xmath5 and @xmath6 satisfy this condition .",
    "we can come fairly close however .",
    "the reason is that because the dilaton of each of the two type ii strings appears in the moduli space of hypermultiplets in a similar way , we may choose both strings to be simultaneously very weakly coupled over the whole moduli space @xmath46 .",
    "this allows us to reliably use the worldsheet approach to analyze mirror pairs .",
    "thus the construction of mirror pairs of  can be reduced to a conformal field theory question in two dimensions .",
    "we will then assume that if two theories are mirror at this conformal field theory level then they will be mirror pairs in the full nonperturbative string theory picture .",
    "the canonical example of mirror pairs of conformal field theories is provided by the greene  plesser construction @xcite .",
    "an explanation of this would require a major diversion into the subtleties of conformal field theories which would take us way beyond the scope of these lectures .",
    "we will then content ourselves to quote their result .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .    consider the weighted projective space @xmath110 with homogeneous coordinates @xmath111 \\cong [ \\lambda^{w_0}x_0,\\lambda^{w_1}x_1 ,        \\ldots,\\lambda^{w_4}x_4],\\ ] ] for @xmath112 .",
    "we may now consider the hypersurface @xmath5 given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 and we impose the condition @xmath115 the projective space will generically have orbifold singularities along subspaces .",
    "these orbifold loci may be blown - up to smooth the space and we assume that @xmath5 is transformed suitably along with this blowing up process to render it smooth .    the greene  plesser statement is then    @xmath5 is mirror to @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is the ( blown - up ) orbifold @xmath116 and @xmath117 is the group with elements @xmath118\\mapsto[\\alpha_0x_0,\\alpha_1x_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_4x_4],\\ ] ] where we impose @xmath119 for all @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "[ prop : gp ]    the essence of this statement can be generalized considerably to hypersurfaces in toric varieties and to complete intersections in toric varieties as was done by batyrev @xcite and borisov @xcite .",
    "this batyrev ",
    "borisov statement is not yet understood at the level of conformal field theory but the evidence that it does produce mirror pairs is very compelling .",
    "thus there are a very large number of candidate mirror pairs of  threefolds .      knowing the mirror partner @xmath6 of @xmath5 is a good start to knowing how to compute the quantum corrections to the prepotential of the type iia compactification but we need a little more information .",
    "namely , we need to know exactly how to map the coordinates on our special khler moduli spaces between the type iia and the type iib picture .",
    "this is known as the `` mirror map '' .",
    "the most direct way of finding the mirror map is to take a little peek into the moduli space of hypermultiplets even though we are only concerned with vector multiplets in this section .",
    "the fact we need to borrow from hypermultiplets is that the ramond - ramond moduli must be mapped into each other under mirror symmetry . for the hypermultiplet moduli spaces we wrote down in section [ ss : ii ]",
    "this shows that @xmath122 is mapped to @xmath123 .",
    "the next statement we need concerns the symmetry of mirror pairs themselves",

    "this statement is completely trivial in terms of the definition of mirror pairs at the level of conformal field theory .",
    "see for example @xcite for more details . here",
    ", since we are trying to be careful about not specifying our definition of string theory , we will just have to assume that this proposition is true .",
    "we therefore may assume that @xmath124 is mapped to @xmath125 under the mirror map .",
    "this implies some map between @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "this map between the _ integral _ structures of the even cohomology of @xmath5 and the odd cohomology of @xmath6 is very interesting and forms one of the most powerful ideas in mirror symmetry .",
    "clearly it can not be an exact statement at the level of classical geometry .",
    "this is because as we wander about the moduli space of complex structures on @xmath6 we may induce monodromy on @xmath128 .",
    "that is , if we pick a certain basis for integral 3-cycles in @xmath6 we may go around a closed loop in moduli space which maps this basis nontrivially back into itself .",
    "if this statement were then mapped into a statement about the type iia string on @xmath5 we would conclude that some even - dimensional cycle , such as a 0-cycle , could magically transmute into a 2-cycle as we move about the moduli space of complexified khler forms .",
    "clearly this does not happen !    to explain this effect in geometric terms kontsevich @xcite has a very interesting proposal based on some ideas by mukai @xcite . rather than thinking in terms of @xmath126",
    "directly one may consider @xmath129 , the _ derived category of coherent sheaves _ on @xmath5 .",
    "objects in @xmath129 are basically complexes of sheaves of the form @xmath130 .",
    "the automorphisms of @xmath51 induced by monodromy can then be understood in many cases in terms of automorphisms of @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "objects in @xmath129 can then be mapped into @xmath126 essentially by using the chern character .",
    "this is a fascinating subject somewhat in its infancy that promises much insight into mirror symmetry and stringy geometry .",
    "instead this statement must only be true classically at the large radius limit of @xmath5 and thus the corresponding `` large complex structure '' limit of @xmath6 . somehow near this limit point , and in particular monodromy about this point , these two integral structures must align classically .",
    "this was first suggested in @xcite and then explained more clearly in @xcite .",
    "let us suppose we fix a point in the moduli space of complex structures , @xmath46 , on @xmath6 which will be our candidate limit point .",
    "as this is a limit point it is natural to expect that @xmath6 will be singular here .",
    "actually one expects to find singular @xmath6 s along complex co - dimension one subspaces of @xmath46 .",
    "this special limit point turns out to be a particularly nasty singularity as it lies on an intersection of many such divisors .",
    "we will assume there are in fact @xmath131 such divisors intersecting transversely at this limit point .",
    "if this is not the case then one may blowup using standard methods in algebraic geometry to reduce back to this case .",
    "we may now consider the monodromy matrices @xmath132 which act on @xmath51 as we go around each of these divisors .",
    "mapping back to @xmath5 this limit point should be the large radius limit as every component of the khler form tends to infinity .",
    "the monodromy about this limit is @xmath133 , where @xmath134 .",
    "this fixes the mirror map as follows .",
    "first we need to switch back to the dual language of periods defined in ( [ eq : periods ] ) .",
    "we will find one period which we denote @xmath135 which is completely invariant under the monodromies @xmath132 .",
    "we also find periods @xmath136 such that @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "the fact we may do this is a special property of the limit point we have chosen and defines the property that it can represent the mirror of a large radius limit point .",
    "this is explained in more detail in @xcite .",
    "we now give the mirror map : @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the complexified khler form on @xmath5 expanded over a basis @xmath141 .",
    "this is the only map possible which gives the correct monodromy and reflects the projective symmetry of the homogeneous coordinates @xmath142 .",
    "the canonical example is that of the quintic threefold as computed in @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath5 is the quintic hypersurface in @xmath143 and thus @xmath6 is @xmath144 according to proposition [ prop : gp ] .",
    "this case is fairly straight - forward as @xmath46 is only one dimensional since @xmath145 . in this case",
    "one can compute the periods and use ( [ eq : pre ] ) to compute @xmath146 where @xmath147 can be viewed as the single component of the complexified khler form on @xmath5 .",
    "note we indeed get the correct leading term @xmath148 from the intersection theory but there are an infinite number of quantum corrections .",
    "the quadratic and linear terms in @xmath149 are physically meaningless whereas the constant term proportional to @xmath150 is a loop term correcting the metric .",
    "the power series in @xmath151 corresponds to the worldsheet instanton corrections .",
    "an instanton in the worldsheet quantum field theory ( [ eq : nlsm ] ) corresponds to a holomorphic map from @xmath152 into the target space @xmath5 @xcite . at tree - level in string theory",
    "such objects are therefore `` rational curves '' ( i.e. holomorphic complex curves of genus zero ) .",
    "this is an important subject and any respectable review of @xmath0 theories in string theory should go into some detail about these rational curves .",
    "we will not do this however as there are already a number of reviews of this subject . as is explained in numerous places elsewhere ,",
    "the quantum corrections may be used to _ count _ the numbers of rational curves in @xmath5 . indeed the 2875 appearing in ( [ eq : cdgp : ] )",
    "corresponds to the number of _ lines _ on a quintic surface .",
    "the interested reader should consult @xcite , for example , for much more information about this vast subject .",
    "one rough and ready way to appreciate why rational curves should make an appearance in mirror symmetry is as follows .",
    "we have already argued that the truly stringy geometry of @xmath5 must somehow mix up the notion of 0-cycles , 2-cycles , 4-cycles , etc as we move away from the large radius limit .",
    "these worldsheet instanton corrections near the large radius limit can be thought of as the way that 2-cycles ( i.e. , rational curves ) start to mix into our notion of 0-cycles ( i.e. , points ) .",
    "this stringy geometry which can mix the notion of points and rational curves has yet to be understood properly .",
    "now we will consider the moduli space @xmath46 in terms of the heterotic string compactified on @xmath153 .",
    "for a field theorist with a bias towards gauge theories this is actually the most useful way of viewing the resulting @xmath0 theories in four dimensions as we now explain .",
    "an abelian gauge theory of @xmath154 in flat space is based on the action @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the gauge coupling constant .",
    "if this is an @xmath0 supersymmetric theory then @xmath157 of the @xmath158 s are associated to vector multiplets and the extra @xmath158 is the `` graviphoton '' coming from the supergravity multiplet . if the gauge particles are actually fundamental strings then the coupling constant should be given by the string dilaton as in equation ( [ eq : qft ] ) and the discussion following this equation . in the heterotic string ,",
    "the dilaton lives in one of the @xmath157 vector multiplets and pairs up with the axion to form the complex field @xmath159 where @xmath107 is the axion .",
    "we should note the difficulty of trying to find such a theory by compactifying a type ii string . here",
    "the dilaton lives in a hypermultiplet which can not couple to the vector bosons in the desired way .",
    "thus the gauge coupling can not be interpreted as a type ii string coupling  gauge bosons can not be fundamental strings .",
    "the fact that such a term is expected in the action immediately tells us the form of the prepotential governing @xmath46 .",
    "this is perhaps easiest to see if we compactify the heterotic string first on @xmath160 times a circle to get an @xmath4 theory in five dimensions , and then compactify on a circle to get our desired four - dimensional theory .",
    "the theory in five dimensions will have generic gauge symmetry @xmath161 as compactifying on a circle gives a @xmath158 via the kaluza ",
    "klein mechanism .",
    "the interesting term in the five - dimensional theory is the chern - simons - like term ( [ eq : cs5 ] ) .",
    "what will this reduce to when we compactify on the circle down to four dimensions ?",
    "the answer is that we will replace the vector field @xmath162 s by four - dimensional real scalar @xmath107 s to form a term @xmath163 but this is the famous cp - violating term of a gauge theory and the scalar field is playing the rle of an axion .",
    "if we want the kinetic term in the standard form ( [ eq : ym ] ) then the _ only _ scalar which is allowed to play the rle of an axion in a theory with @xmath0 supersymmetry is the axion partner of the dilaton , namely the @xmath107 in ( [ eq : s ] ) . in addition this axion is not allowed to appear as a coefficient in front of field strengths associated with the @xmath158 gauge boson in the same multiplet as the axion and dilaton .",
    "this would lead to rather unorthodox terms proportional to @xmath164 in the action under supersymmetrization .",
    "this implies immediately that the superpotential in five dimensions is of the form @xmath165 , for some matrix @xmath166 , for @xmath167 and where the @xmath168 s are the five - dimensional moduli fields associated to the vector supermultiplets other than the dilaton .",
    "of course we expect this cubic superpotential to be corrected when we are in four dimensions just as the cubic potential was corrected for the type iia compactifications in section [ ss : mir ] .",
    "this time however the corrections will not be @xmath83-corrections due to worldsheet instantons but they will be @xmath156-corrections due to gauge instantons in spacetime .",
    "the cubic superpotential @xmath169 which is exact in five dimensions and correct to leading order in four dimensions is rather constraining .",
    "we may also note that in order for the kinetic term for the photons to be positive - definite it is required that @xmath166 have signature @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "running through a lengthy process using the definitions of special khler geometry this leads to a moduli space for our four - dimensional theory locally of the form @xcite @xmath171 _ before quantum corrections . _",
    "the first thing to note about this space is that it is a product of two symmetric spaces  just the kind of thing we would expect if we had more supersymmetry .",
    "the second thing to note is that the second term looks a lot like narain s moduli spaces as we discussed in section [ sss : eh ] .",
    "this term represents just what we would expect if we look at the stringy moduli space of vector bundles of rank @xmath172 over a 2-torus , together with deformations of the torus itself .",
    "this is excellent news .",
    "it means that if we identify the first term with the dilaton and axion then we have a very natural interpretation of this moduli space in terms of the data discussed in section [ sss : eh ] .    to get the moduli space perfectly correct we need to worry about the global form .",
    "if the second term really is the narain moduli space of the bundle @xmath173 discussed in section [ sss : eh ] then we should really expect it to be of the form @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the lattice of signature @xmath176 given by @xmath177 and where @xmath67 is the cartan lattice of the structure group of @xmath178 with _ negative _ definite signature .",
    "one might also be tempted to replace the first term of ( [ eq : het0 ] ) by the expression @xmath179 this @xmath180 would certainly respect the axion shift symmetry @xmath181 which we expect to be correct but it would also imply some strong - weak coupling duality for @xmath0 theories in four dimensions .",
    "this does not exist in general .",
    "the problem is that moduli space ( [ eq : het0 ] ) ignores quantum corrections and it therefore only correct as the dilaton tends to @xmath182 .",
    "the only part of @xmath180 which preserves this limit is the axion shift symmetry .",
    "if we could find a type iib string compactification dual to this heterotic model then we could compute the prepotential exactly , just as we did by mirror symmetry for the type iia string .",
    "this would allow us to compute the nonperturbative corrections to the moduli space arising from quantum corrections due to @xmath156 .    oddly enough it is much more natural to ask first for a type iia string dual to the heterotic model we desire .",
    "if the type iia string compactified on @xmath5 is dual to the heterotic string model giving the gauge theory of section [ sss : u1 ] then we know a surprising amount of the geometry of @xmath5 with very little effort .",
    "the fact that the prepotential is @xmath183 to leading order tells us about the cup product structure of @xmath94 or equivalently , the intersection form on @xmath96 .",
    "in particular from ( [ eq : kcap ] ) it tells us that the 4-cycle @xmath184 representing the complexified dilaton @xmath185 satisfies @xmath186 for any @xmath187 ( whether it be associated to @xmath185 or a @xmath168 ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath188 is empty",

    "we need the component of the khler form which controls the size of a 2-cycle which is dual ( via intersection theory ) to this k3 fibre .",

    "[ prop : hbase ]    we refer to @xcite for a careful statement of the assumptions which go into this proposition .",

    "in the limit that these spheres shrink to zero size we obtain new massless states in the theory .",
    "these massless states may lie in either hypermultiplets or vector multiplets .",
    "which type is determined by the moduli space of the 2-cycle that shrank down to zero size .",
    "witten showed @xcite that isolated curves give rise to hypermultiplets and curves that live in families parametrized by other curves give vectors .",
    "thus , in our case where we are shrinking down whole families of curves in order to obtain a  threefold with a singular curve we expect extra vectors .",
    "these vectors are the `` w - bosons '' which enhance the gauge group to a nonabelian group .",
    "the case we have considered here is actually a special case of acquiring a singular curve in @xmath5 and so must be considered to be a special case of acquiring nonabelian gauge symmetry .",
    "consider the projection given by the k3-fibration @xmath226 when @xmath227 is a singular space made by shrinking down a particular curve ( or set of curves ) within every k3 fibre .",
    "let @xmath228 be the resulting singular curve within @xmath227 .",
    "the restriction of the fibration @xmath229 is an isomorphism .",
    "suppose that we can find another family of curves within @xmath5 which can be shrunk down to form another singular space @xmath230 with a singular set @xmath231 .",
    "the projection under @xmath232 of a general singular set may or may not be surjective onto @xmath193 .",
    "_ in particular we may have that the image under @xmath232 is a point ( or a set of points ) in @xmath193 .",
    "_ it is not hard to see that the fibre over such a point in @xmath193 is peculiar and could not possibly be a smooth k3 fibre .",
    "indeed we are talking about contributions of `` type iii '' to the moduli space of vector multiplets when we shrink such 2-cycles down .",
    "we therefore claim that a singular curve lying over a _ point _ in @xmath193 must correspond to a _ nonperturbative _ enhanced gauge group .",
    "we will see examples of nonperturbative gauge groups in section  [ ss : hclas ] .",
    "now that we have spoken rather abstractly about duality let us give an example which illustrates most of what we have discussed above .",
    "this example first appeared in @xcite .",
    "we begin by describing the  threefold @xmath5 on which we will compactify the type iia string .",
    "let @xmath5 be the hypersurface @xmath233 in the weighted projective space @xmath234 with homogeneous coordinates @xmath235 \\cong [ \\lambda^{12}x_0,\\lambda^8x_1 ,       \\lambda^2x_2,\\lambda x_3,\\lambda x_4].\\ ] ] note that this satisfies the  condition ( [ eq : cyc ] ) .",
    "we also need to note that this  threefold is not smooth .",
    "in particular , putting @xmath236 we obtain @xmath235 \\cong [ x_0,x_1,-x_2 , ix_3 , ix_4].\\ ] ] which produces a @xmath237 singularity at @xmath238 $ ] which is a single point in @xmath5 .",
    "similarly putting @xmath239 puts a @xmath36 singularity along @xmath240 $ ] , which is a curve in @xmath5 ( containing the previous @xmath237 fixed point ) .",
    "these quotient singularities need to be blown up if we want a nice smooth  threefold for @xmath5 . for the singular curve in @xmath5 fixed by @xmath36 we may replace each point in this curve by a @xmath195 .",
    "the homogeneous coordinates of this @xmath195 may be considered to be @xmath241 $ ] ( which are not now allowed to vanish simultaneously  we have removed the singularity after all ! ) .",
    "actually we may view @xmath241 $ ] as the coordinates of @xmath242 and project in the obvious way @xmath243 let us denote a given point on @xmath193 by @xmath244 .",
    "that is , let @xmath245 .",
    "then the inverse image of a point in @xmath193 under @xmath232 is @xmath246 in the weighted projective space @xmath247 .",
    "this is a k3 surface as required .",
    "this is most easily seen by putting @xmath248 giving us an equation in @xmath249 .",
    "thus we have written @xmath5 as a k3-fibration .",
    "we may now play the same trick again on each k3 fibre .",
    "each k3 fibre has a @xmath36 singularity in it ( as a side effect of the @xmath237 singularity in the original threefold ) .",
    "this may be resolved by replacing it with a @xmath195 which we denote @xmath250 .",
    "thus the fibre itself may be written as a bundle over @xmath251 with fibre given by a cubic equation in @xmath252  namely an elliptic curve .",
    "thus our final smooth @xmath5 consists of a k3-fibration over @xmath242 where each k3 fibre is itself an elliptic fibration over another @xmath251 .",
    "all these fibrations have sections allowing us to identify @xmath193 and @xmath250 as the bases of fibrations with subspaces of @xmath5 .",
    "now we may describe @xmath200 , or equivalently @xmath196 , in terms of this k3 fibration in the language of section [ sss : hiia ] .    1 .",
    "we have the size of the section @xmath193 .",
    "this gives one vector multiplet .",
    "2 .   we may vary the sizes of the section @xmath250 of each k3 fibre and we may vary the size of each elliptic fibre of these k3 s .",
    "this gives two more vector multiplets .",
    "the only bad k3 fibres occur where @xmath253 in ( [ eq : k3fib ] ) .",
    "the resulting polynomial does not factorize and so this bad fibre is still irreducible .",
    "therefore we obtain no more vector multiplets associated with bad fibres .",
    "so we have a theory with three vector multiplets ( indeed , @xmath254 ) .",
    "we may now write down the form of the moduli space to leading order using proposition  [ prop : p ] .",
    "first we need the picard lattice of the generic k3 fibre .",
    "there are two generators : the elliptic fibre , @xmath255 and the @xmath195 section @xmath256 .",
    "it is not hard to show that @xmath257 , @xmath258 , and @xmath259 .",
    "this intersection matrix is isomorphic to @xmath212 .",
    "thus @xmath260 and @xmath261 in ( [ eq : narf2 ] ) .",
    "let us try to find a heterotic string interpretation of this moduli space .",
    "going back to the discussion around equation ( [ eq : narf ] ) we see that we have the simplest case where @xmath67 , the cartan lattice of @xmath217 , is empty and indeed the rank of @xmath217 is @xmath262 .",
    "the vector moduli space is purely described in terms of deformations of the dilaton - axion and the narain moduli space of the 2-torus @xmath215 with _ no _ bundle degrees of freedom .",
    "this accounts for all three vector moduli .    in other words ,",
    "all the the primordial gauge group in ten dimensions must have been sucked up with the bundle on the k3 surface @xmath160 leaving nothing left for @xmath215 to play with . to describe exactly what this bundle on @xmath160 is requires a knowledge of the hypermultiplet moduli space and so we wo nt be able to discover this until section  [ sss : e8l ] .",
    "we get enhanced gauge symmetries in the following ways .",
    "we may shrink down the section @xmath256 in every k3 fibre .",
    "the undoes the second blow - up we did when resolving at the start of this section .",
    "it produces a single curve of `` @xmath263 '' singularities within @xmath5 .",
    "it corresponds to putting the space - like 2-plane @xmath223 perpendicular to the single vector @xmath264 .",
    "either way , we get an @xmath213 gauge symmetry .    we may also squeeze out a rank 2 gauge symmetry  either @xmath265 or @xmath190 by tuning the vector moduli further . this can be seen by noting that @xmath266 and @xmath267 can both be embedded in @xmath210 and we may arrange @xmath223 to be orthogonal to either .",
    "this corresponds to shrinking the elliptic fiber , @xmath255 , down to an area of order 1 as well as tuning the size of @xmath256 .",
    "the precise details are given in @xcite .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the type iib picture .",
    "using proposition [ prop : gp ] we see that @xmath6 is given by @xmath268 where the generators of the quotienting group are given by @xmath269&\\mapsto [ x_0,x_1,x_2,e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{24}}x_3 , e^{-\\frac{2\\pi i}{24}}x_4]\\\\ g_2:[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4]&\\mapsto [ x_0,x_1,e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{12}}x_2,x_3 , e^{-\\frac{2\\pi i}{12}}x_4 ] .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] the general form of @xmath6 may be written as a quotient of @xmath5 with defining equation @xmath270 the three parameters @xmath271 , @xmath272 and @xmath26 then give the three deformations of complex structure of @xmath6 ( as @xmath273 ) .",
    "knowing the details of the mirror map allows us to map these parameters to the complexified khler form of the type iia description .",
    "one may determine this using the `` monomial - divisor '' mirror map of @xcite when one has a hypersurface in a weighted projective space .",
    "this particular model was also studied in @xcite .",
    "the upshot is that if @xmath5 is in the `` phase '' where the areas of all possible algebraic curves are large then essentially    * letting @xmath274 will take the size of the elliptic fibre off to infinity . *",
    "letting @xmath275 sends the size of the section @xmath193 off to infinity . *",
    "letting @xmath276 sends the area of the rational curve @xmath256 within each k3 fibre off to infinity .",
    "the parameters @xmath277 are chosen so that the interior of the khler cone of @xmath5 is described asymptotically by @xmath278 , @xmath279 and @xmath280 . away from this limit",
    "these parameters can get mixed up and everything is less clear although well - understood .",
    "so far we have discussed purely the classical limit of the heterotic string theory where we assume the dilaton is such that the coupling is very weak and that the prepotential is purely cubic .",
    "thanks to the duality of the heterotic string to the type iib string we may try to continue our analysis of the heterotic string away from this classical limit .",
    "this is an enormous subject but we will be very brief here .",
    "our intention is to give only a flavour of the subject .",
    "let us explain what happens in terms of the example of the previous section . in particular let us study what happens to the would - be @xmath213 gauge theory which appears when every k3 fibre of @xmath5 contains an @xmath263 singularity .",
    "first of all we mentioned that we could actually get the gauge group to be @xmath265 or @xmath190 if we tuned the size of the k3 fibre suitably .",
    "let s not concern ourselves with this fact here and let us instead assume that the parameter @xmath271 ( or equivalently @xmath281 ) in the last section is at any generic value .",
    "now we can ask ourselves if anything interesting happens to @xmath6 as we vary @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "in particular , the most obvious question to ask is whether @xmath6 is ever singular .",
    "@xmath6 is singular whenever @xmath284 has a solution for ( [ eq : y ] ) . with a little algebra",
    "we find that this has a fairly simple solution for @xmath285 .",
    "in this case we have 12 singular points in @xmath6 lying in the subspace @xmath286 . we know that varying @xmath282 has something to do with varying the dilaton in the heterotic string",
    "so this suggests that something curious happens in our model when the heterotic string coupling is of order 1 .",
    "while this sounds interesting it is a bit too exotic for our purposes here !",
    "we would rather discover something interesting which happens near weak coupling .",
    "the next simplest solution one finds is when we have singular points in the larger subspace @xmath287 .",
    "this demands that @xmath288 if our heterotic string has zero coupling we set @xmath289 and so this has a solution when @xmath290 .",
    "one may show that @xmath290 is exactly the value required to make the little curves @xmath256 in each k3 fibre of @xmath5 acquire zero size @xcite .",
    "so this must be exactly where we expect to see enhanced @xmath213 gauge symmetry .",
    "to summarize we expect to see an @xmath213 gauge symmetry whenever @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "now we may probe into nonzero coupling by letting @xmath282 acquire a small nonzero value .",
    "the odd thing to note is that ( [ eq : a1d ] ) then has _ two _ solutions for @xmath283 near 1 .",
    "somehow our single @xmath213 theory has split into two interesting things for nonzero heterotic dilaton .    at this point",
    "we could easily go off and explore the wonders of these quantum corrections .",
    "this subject is generally called `` seiberg  witten '' theory @xcite .",
    "these lecture notes would be dwarfed by a full treatment of this subject so instead we will refer to @xcite , for example , for a review .    here",
    "we will just review some basic properties . in its basic form seiberg ",
    "witten theory is not a theory which includes gravity .",
    "it is a very interesting question as to how one can remove gravity from the four - dimensional theory we have constructed .",
    "one might regard the removal of gravity as a rather regressive thing to do  after all it was precisely because string theory contains gravity that string theory became so popular in the first place .",
    "nevertheless going to a limit where gravity can be ignored provides a very useful way of making contact between what is known about string theory and quantum field theory .",

    "mills theory which remains .",
    "this process is explained in detail in @xcite .    in a way",
    "this limit is one of the cleanest ways of viewing the process of `` dynamical scale generation '' in quantum field theory .",
    "we desire to zoom in on the part of the moduli space where gravity is weakly coupled but the structure of the @xmath213 gauge theory of interest forces us to fix a scale .",

    "these are the remnants of the `` w - bosons '' which appeared classically to enhance the gauge symmetry .",
    "there is one aspect of this `` zooming in '' process which is of great interest when discussing the geometry of @xmath0 theories .",
    "namely , the structure of special khler geometry changes .",
    "if one considers the geometry of the moduli space with _ no _ gravity then ( [ eq : metric ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath297 where @xmath168 are _ affine _ coordinates .",
    "this form of special khler geometry is often referred to as `` rigid '' special khler geometry while that of section [ ss : sk ] is called `` local '' special khler geometry .",
    "the key point , as discussed in @xcite for example , is that while local special khler geometry is associated to the moduli space of complex  threefolds , rigid special khler geometry is associated to the moduli space of complex _",
    "curves_. thus we should expect the theory of @xmath0 supersymmetric field theories without gravity to be associated to riemann surfaces in much the same way that these theories with gravity were associated to  threefolds .",
    "this is pretty much exactly what seiberg ",
    "witten theory @xcite does .",
    "an @xmath213 gauge theory is associated with an elliptic curve for example .",
    "the exact way in which this curve appears in the limit of the threefold as we decouple gravity is not at all clear .",
    "a fairly systematic way of doing this construction was explained in @xcite in the case that @xmath6 is constructed using toric geometry .",
    "see also @xcite for an earlier analysis of this problem and @xcite , for example , for further discussion .",
    "the geometry of the  threefold makes an explicit appearance for @xmath0 theories with gravity  it is the threefold @xmath6 on which the type iib string is compactified . the manifest geometry of the riemann surface in the case of seiberg ",
    "witten theory is a little more obscure .",
    "possibly the best suggestion for a direct picture in which this curve appears was given by witten @xcite in terms of m - theory and world - volume theories of d - branes .",
    "our discussion of the moduli space of the type iia picture and the heterotic picture for @xmath46 were in excellent agreement so long as we ignored quantum effects . in both cases we had a `` narain '' factor in the form of the symmetric space given in ( [ eq : narf ] ) . in the language of the heterotic string this consisted of the moduli of the 2-torus @xmath215 together with the degrees of freedom of the wilson lines of the flat bundle @xmath178 .",
    "the group @xmath298 gave the t - dualities of the heterotic string on a torus .",
    "in particular if we consider the example of section [ sss : ex1 ] then we have a narain factor of the form @xmath299 here we have used the standard decomposition of the grassmannian into a form which makes it more recognizable for our purposes .",
    "we have two copies of the upper half - plane @xmath300 which we parameterize by complex numbers @xmath301 and @xmath302 respectively .",
    "the groups @xmath303 and @xmath304 are both isomorphic to @xmath36 and are generated by @xmath305 respectively .",
    "we refer to @xcite , for example , for details of this isomorphism .",
    "we depict this moduli space in figure  [ fig : t ] .",
    "the interpretation of this moduli space in terms of @xmath215 is straight - forward .",
    "we let @xmath302 denote the complex structure in the standard way and we let @xmath301 denote the single component of @xmath306 .",
    "thus the @xmath180 action on @xmath302 is the standard modular invariance of a 2-torus .",
    "the @xmath180 acting on @xmath301 is composed of the familiar @xmath307 symmetry as well as a @xmath308 t - duality .",
    "note that @xmath303 is `` mirror symmetry '' for a 2-torus as was first seen in @xcite .",
    "@xmath304 can be thought of as a complex conjugation symmetry of the theory .",
    "this is all very well but we have noticed in the previous section that this picture of the moduli space is subject to quantum corrections .",
    "that is , this narain picture of the moduli space of @xmath215 is _ not _ exact .",
    "we will now argue that the effect of these quantum corrections is to completely ruin the description of the moduli space as a quotient and so any notion of t - duality for @xmath215 is lost .    to argue this",
    "let us discuss what can go wrong with t - duality arguments in another example .",
    "we will consider the classical quintic hypersurface in @xmath143 as was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the manifold has @xmath309 .",
    "when we flatten out the single complex coordinate describing @xmath306 we obtain the moduli space depicted in figure  [ fig : q ] . now",
    "although this moduli space looks similar to the fundamental region of @xmath310 there is a big difference .",
    "there is no action of any discrete group on @xmath311 for which the region in figure  [ fig : q ] is a fundamental region .",
    "one may see this as follows .",
    "note that there is an angle of @xmath312 formed at the lowest point in this region .",
    "one should therefore need 5 fundamental regions touching at this point .",
    "indeed one may find such regions and they are pictured in figure 5.2 of @xcite .",
    "one can also see that the @xmath307 symmetry should allow us to translate these fundamental regions one unit to the left or right to form new fundamental regions .",
    "the problem is that doing this translation gives a region which overlaps in an open set with one the regions we built earlier by rotating by @xmath312 .",
    "thus these supposed fundamental regions do not _ tessellate _ in @xmath311 and therefore can not be derived in terms of a group action on @xmath311 .",
    "indeed we argued in section [ s : gen ] that @xmath0 theories in four dimensions do not generically have locally symmetric moduli space .",
    "it was in the context of symmetric spaces that we saw the natural appearance of t - duality .",
    "it should not therefore be a surprise that we do not find the true analogue of a modular group for the quintic threefold .",
    "we should therefore expect that the quintic threefold represents the generic case of a  moduli space .",
    "in particular once we turn on the heterotic string coupling , i.e. , give finite size to the section @xmath193 of the example in section [ sss : ex1 ] the narain description of the moduli space is lost .",
    "this is argued in @xcite .",
    "so if the heterotic string on a torus does _ not _ respect t - duality how should we really describe the moduli space ?",
    "the principle should be the same as that for the quintic threefold .",
    "one should begin with a weakly coupled heterotic string on a large circle or torus .",
    "here one unambiguously sees the geometry of the compactification .",
    "now move about the moduli space of compactifications . in this",
    "we can label every point in the moduli space by a set of moduli ( such as radii ) for the torus .",
    "one problem we have to be careful about is that we may follow loops in the moduli space which allow us to identify more than one torus with a given point in the moduli space of theories .",
    "we _ must _ avoid this by putting cuts in the moduli space .",
    "if we do not put in such cuts then generically one would expect to be able to identify every possible torus with each point in the moduli space !",
    "( note that since the classical @xmath313 symmetry of a @xmath42-torus is lost one must describe the torus directly in terms of data which chooses a fundamental region of the classical moduli space of flat metrics . )",
    "once we have completed this labelling process ( the details of which depend on a choice of cuts ) we have defined every possible torus to be considered .",
    "tori excluded by the process , such a circle of radius less that @xmath314 , do not exist and should not be considered .",
    "it is only the accidental t - duality of the weakly - coupled string that led us to believe that we could make real sense of small tori .",
    "this example consisted of a moduli space @xmath46 which became locally a symmetric space on its boundary at infinite distance corresponding to some classical limit .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are other known examples where a subspace of @xmath46 can be locally symmetric .",
    "for example consider the so - called z - orbifold @xmath315 with 27 fixed points .",
    "the rational curves in this space ( after blowing up ) conspire to only give certain quantum corrections to @xmath46 .",
    "the effect of this is to make the prepotential @xmath65 exactly cubic if none of the 27 blow - up modes are switched on @xcite .",
    "the result is that we get a slice of the moduli space ( at finite distance ) of the form @xmath316 moving away from this subspace there are instanton corrections and the symmetric space structure is lost .",
    "note that in general we lose the _ classical _ @xmath180 symmetry of the complex structure of the torus in addition to any t - duality .",
    "how can this be ?    the moduli space of a 2-torus of volume one is determined by considering the ways of making a a lattice of area one , dividing out by rotations , and then dividing out by the modular group @xmath180 .",
    "this gives us the familiar form @xmath317 .",
    "if we declare that quantum effects break this structure then quantum effects must be having a drastic effect on this construction of the torus . as well as breaking the @xmath180 invariance",
    ", we are also modifying the @xmath318 part .",
    "it is as if we are breaking the picture of the 2-torus as a riemannian manifold .",
    "hopefully once stringy geometry is better - understood it will be more clear what is happening here .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are two distinct types of u - dualities discussed in the literature .",
    "one is an `` internal duality '' statement where one says that a string theory of type @xmath319 ( e.g. , type iia , @xmath7 heterotic etc . )",
    "compactified on @xmath227 with coupling @xmath320 is dual to a string theory of the same type @xmath319 compactified on @xmath230 with coupling @xmath321 .",
    "alternatively one has an `` external duality '' where one says that a string theory of type @xmath319 compactified on @xmath227 with coupling @xmath320 is dual to a string theory of a _ different _ type @xmath322 compactified on @xmath230 with coupling @xmath321 .",
    "our discussion of the breaking of t - dualities ( and by implication u - dualities ) was in the context of internal dualities .",
    "in particular we were fixing our string as an @xmath7 heterotic string .",
    "what happens when the external duality relating an @xmath7 heterotic string on a given torus and a given choice of wilson lines to a @xmath8 heterotic string on another torus and set of wilson lines ?",
    "our discussion of mapping out the moduli space should apply again .",
    "map out the moduli space of tori and wilson lines as above using the @xmath323 heterotic string .",
    "now do the same thing with the @xmath8 heterotic string .",
    "note that the starting point for the large torus will not be the same limit point in moduli space as the former case .",
    "this means that every point in the moduli space will now have two labels  one for each heterotic string .",
    "one should not obtain small radii for _ either _ heterotic string interpretation .",
    "thus strictly external u - dualities need not be broken by quantum effects .",
    "the precise mapping between @xmath324 and @xmath325 can be expected to be modified however .",
    "now we come to the considerably more tricky subject of trying to map out the moduli space of hypermultiplets for our @xmath0 theories in four dimensions . in the case of the vector multiplet moduli space ,",
    "the type iib string compactified on @xmath6 gave an exact model .",
    "for the hypermultiplets there is no exact model .",
    "this makes the subject much more difficult and potentially much more interesting !",
    "the purpose of these lectures is to discuss some special properties of @xmath0 theories in four dimensions .",
    "it turns out to be very useful to be aware of some other closely - related theories in both higher and lower dimensions than four to help gain insight into the hypermultiplet moduli space .",
    "imagine compactifying the heterotic string on a k3 surface @xmath160 .",
    "this would yield a theory with @xmath326 supersymmetry in six dimensions .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a good discussion of many aspects of such theories .",
    "this has an @xmath9-symmetry of @xmath327 .",
    "we discussed the supermultiplets of such theories in section [ ss : n2 ] .",
    "such a theory may then be compactified on a 2-torus to yield our familiar @xmath0 theory in four dimensions . upon dimensional reduction",
    ", the @xmath326 supermultiplets in six dimensions become @xmath0 supermultiplets in four dimensions as follows :    * a six - dimensional _ hypermultiplet _ becomes a hypermultiplet in four dimensions .",
    "* a six - dimensional _ vector _ multiplet becomes a vector multiplet in four dimensions . * a six - dimensional _ tensor _ multiplet becomes a vector multiplet in four dimensions .",
    "in particular the hypermultiplet moduli space of a heterotic string compactified on a k3 surface @xmath160 is exactly the same as the hypermultiplet moduli space of a heterotic string compactified on @xmath153 .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier comment that all the hypermultiplet information comes from the k3 surface @xmath160 .",
    "it is therefore quite common to analyze the hypermultiplet moduli space in terms of six - dimensional physics rather than four - dimensional physics .",
    "having said that , our duality statements might now sound a bit peculiar .",
    "we want to say something to the effect that we can model the hypermultiplet moduli space of a heterotic string on a k3 surface in terms of a type iia string on a  threefold @xmath5 but the former is six - dimensional while the latter is four - dimensional .",
    "it is important to note that we can not necessarily completely ignore the 2-torus @xmath215 in the product @xmath153 . in effect",
    "we can think of arriving at our six - dimensional theory by beginning in four dimensions and decompactifying @xmath215 . to do this",
    "we certainly need the full moduli space of @xmath215 and from proposition  [ prop : f1 ] this in turn implies that the  threefold @xmath5 is _ an elliptic fibration with a section_. assuming this is the case , we may model the six - dimensional physics of the heterotic string on @xmath160 in terms of the type iia string on @xmath5 by implicitly decompactifying @xmath215 .",
    "this mechanism of using type iia strings on @xmath5 to model six - dimension physics is known as `` f - theory '' .",
    "the reader should be warned that there are at least two other ways of defining f - theory common in the literature .",
    "one is to treat f - theory as twelve dimensional ( although whether it lives in @xmath328 or @xmath329 is unclear ) .",
    "another way is to view it as a type iib string compactification with a varying dilaton .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "the type iia definition of f - theory is well - suited for our purposes of linking the subject to four dimensions .",
    "let us denote the elliptic fibration as @xmath330 , where @xmath331 is a complex surface .",
    "we also know we have a k3-fibration @xmath332 , where @xmath242 , and a fibration @xmath333 with generic fibre given by @xmath195 .",
    "that is , @xmath331 is a `` ruled surface '' . if @xmath331 is a smooth @xmath195-bundle over @xmath193 , it is the `` hirzebruch surface '' @xmath334 . here",
    "the section @xmath335 has self - intersection @xmath336 within @xmath331 .",
    "blowing up @xmath334 at a few points replaces some of the smooth @xmath195-fibres by chains of @xmath195 s .",
    "it is common to then draw @xmath5 ( representing a complex dimension as a real dimension ) in the following form .",
    "we may use the plane of the paper to represent @xmath331 by letting the horizontal direction represent the section and the vertical direction represent the @xmath195-fibre .",
    "that is , the `` ruling '' of the ruled surface @xmath331 is given by vertical lines . now over a ( complex ) codimension one subspace of @xmath331 the elliptic fibration @xmath330 will degenerate .",
    "we may draw this `` discriminant '' locus as a set of curves and lines in the plane of the paper .",
    "kodaira has classified the possibilities for how an elliptic fibre may degenerate in the case of one parameter family @xcite .",
    "we show the possibilities in figure  [ fig : kod ] . with the exception of @xmath337 which is the smooth elliptic case , and @xmath338 which is an elliptic curve with a cusp , each line in the figure represents a rational curve .",
    "this curve may appear with a multiplicity given by the small numbers in the figure .",
    "this classification can be used to label the generic points on the irreducible components of the discriminant locus .",
    "the result is that one obtains a picture somewhat typically like figure  [ fig : eleg ] for @xmath5 in the form of an elliptic fibration . in this figure",
    "the dotted lines represent lines ( @xmath195 s ) within @xmath331 .",
    "@xmath339 is a section and @xmath256 is a generic @xmath195 fibre .",
    "note that this notation is consistent with the @xmath256 which appeared in section [ sss : ex1 ] . at one point over @xmath193",
    "we have put a fibre as a chain of three @xmath195 s .",
    "the solid lines represent the discriminant locus .",
    "each irreducible component is labelled by its kodaira type .",
    "when these components collide , the elliptic fibration will degenerate further and the resulting fibre need not lie in kodaira s classification .    since we wish to study the moduli space of hypermultiplets we are particularly interested in the deformations of complex structure of @xmath5 .",
    "when we draw @xmath5 as an elliptic fibration , the complex structure is encoded in the discriminant locus .",
    "thus , deformations of @xmath5 are given simply by the deformations of the discriminant locus .",
    "it will also be worthwhile to note how the khler form data appears in the elliptic fibration .",
    "deforming the khler form may either affect areas in the fibre direction ( i.e. , the area of the generic fibre as well as areas within the chains of special kodaira fibres ) or affect areas within @xmath331 . as we decompactify @xmath215 to go from 4 dimensions to 6 dimensions",
    "one can show that the areas in the fibre direction become meaningless @xcite .",
    "our discussion of the types of supermultiplets in four and six dimensions given at the start of this section leads one to conclude :    * using the khler form to vary areas in the fibre direction corresponds to moduli in a six - dimensional _ vector _ supermultiplet . *",
    "using the khler form to vary areas in @xmath331 corresponds to moduli in a six - dimensional _ tensor _ supermultiplet .",
    "imagine taking our @xmath0 theory in four dimension and compactifying further on a circle .",
    "this leads to a theory in three dimensions with @xmath3 supersymmetry .",
    "this has an @xmath9-symmetry of @xmath340 ( up to irrelevant discrete factors ) which implies that the moduli space should factorize into a product of two quaternionic khler spaces .",
    "these three dimensional theories have two different types of `` hypermultiplets '' whose moduli spaces can not mix . in the literature one often refers to one of these types of hypermultiplets as `` vector multiplets '' to reflect their four - dimensional origin .",
    "however , one should be aware that , within the context of the three - dimensional physics , such a distinction is arbitrary .",
    "note that the hypermultiplet moduli space @xmath86 from four dimensions comes through unscathed into the three dimensional picture whereas our vector multiplet moduli space becomes `` quaternionified '' in the compactification .",
    "it is remarkable how resilient @xmath86 is !",
    "it is unchanged as we compactify on circles a theory in six dimensions with @xmath326 supersymmetry down to three dimensions .",
    "compare this with the capricious vector multiplet moduli space which is non - existent in 6 dimensions , real in 5 dimensions , complex in 4 dimensions and quaternionic in 3 dimensions !    because the vector multiplet moduli space becomes a hypermultiplet moduli space upon compactification to three dimensions , this picture provides a potentially useful way of using our knowledge of special khler manifolds to uncover some of the mysteries of quaternionic khler manifolds .",
    "suppose we wish to study @xmath341 for a type iia string compactified on the  threefold @xmath5 .",

    "since the type iia string on a circle of radius @xmath9 is supposedly t - dual to the type iib string on a circle of radius @xmath345 , the type iia string on @xmath346 should be dual to the type iib string on @xmath347 .",
    "using mirror symmetry this is then dual to the type iia string on @xmath348 .",

    "having said that , @xmath341 is unchanged by this circle compactification and so @xmath349    we already questioned the validity of t - duality for the heterotic string in section [ sss : tsnap ] .",
    "it is natural to question whether t - duality is valid for the type ii strings when we have only modestly extended supersymmetry .",
    "the crude statement that the type iia string compactified on @xmath346 is dual to the type iib string compactified on @xmath347 is almost certainly incorrect .",
    "it is true however that one should expect this to be exact when the strings are very weakly coupled .",
    "most analyses of strings using this statement of t - duality such as @xcite do use only weakly - coupled strings .",
    "we will not try to elucidate the exact meaning of t - duality in type ii strings in these lectures .",

    "an interesting attempt at this problem was made some time ago by cecotti et al .   in @xcite .",

    "@xmath351    a notable case of the @xmath350-map is @xmath352 we will revisit this briefly in section [ sss : univ ] .    of course , unless we pick a very special model to examine , there _ will _ be quantum corrections and the analysis of @xcite will not be directly applicable . however , this method may provide a good starting point for the analysis of the quaternionic khler moduli spaces as it does give the asymptotic behaviour where quantum effects can be neglected .",
    "an exact version of the @xmath350-map was elucidated by seiberg and witten @xcite in the case of rigid special khler geometry . as discussed in section [ sss : sw ] , @xmath342 is described in this limit by the deformation of a complex _ curve _ @xmath353 .",
    "seiberg and witten s remarkably simple result is then    in the case that @xmath354 is a rigid special khler space , @xmath344 is simply the hyperkhler space given by an abelian ( i.e. , complex algebraic torus ) fibration over @xmath342 where the fibre is given by the jacobian @xmath355 .",
    "in addition the volume of the fibre is determined by @xmath9 , the radius of the circle on which one compactifies . [",
    "prop : sw3 ]      since direct analysis of the hypermultiplet moduli space is so formidable the most prudent course of action is to try to squeeze as much information out of our knowledge of the vector multiplet moduli space as we possible can .",
    "this is facilitated by the occurrence of phase transitions or `` extremal transitions '' .",
    "we go to a funny point in moduli space where vector moduli disappear and new hypermultiplet moduli appear .",
    "we may then pretend that we actually did this process in reverse and claim that we know something about what happens when we move around in the moduli space of hypermultiplets !",
    "let us consider the simplest type of extremal transition first  the `` conifold '' of @xcite .",
    "we may understand this both from the point of view of geometry and from the point of view of field theory as explained in @xcite .",
    "we begin with the geometrical picture .",
    "consider the type iib string compactified on the  manifold @xmath6 .",
    "we move about the moduli space of vector multiplets by deforming the complex structure of @xmath6 .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional family of such @xmath6 s and denote an element of this family by @xmath356 where @xmath149 parameterizes the family .",
    "at a special point in this part of the moduli space , say @xmath357 , @xmath6 may become singular .",
    "the simplest thing that can happen as @xmath358 is that an @xmath359 can contract to a point .",
    "locally such a singularity would look like the hypersurface @xmath360 in @xmath361 .",
    "this is called a `` conifold singularity '' .",
    "locally such a conifold point can be resolved by replacing the point by a @xmath195 ( see , for example , @xcite for a nice explanation of this ) .",
    "since the khler form controls the areas of @xmath195 s such a resolution might be pictured as a deformation of khler form . in other words",
    "we have turned a degree of freedom from a deformation of complex structure into a deformation of khler form .    globally",
    "this picture does not work quite this simply .",
    "we need to consider the case of @xmath27 disjoint @xmath359 s , each shrinking to a point at @xmath357 .",
    "if @xmath356 represents the smooth @xmath6 for a generic value of @xmath149 then a simple application of the mayer - vietoris sequence gives a relationship between the homology of @xmath356 and the homology of @xmath362 .",
    "see @xcite for a full description of this process .",
    "now resolve the resulting @xmath27 conifold points by adding @xmath195 s and call the resulting smooth manifold @xmath363 .",
    "another application of the mayer - vietoris sequence gives a relationship between the homology of @xmath362 and the homology of @xmath363 .",

    "by poincar duality the rank of @xmath367 must also then be @xmath365 .",
    "note that @xmath365 represents the dimension of the kernel of the map @xmath368 , i.e. , the number of homology relations between the @xmath27 3-spheres in the smooth @xmath6 .",

    "note that @xmath371 is required for this transition to make sense and so a single conifold point is not sufficient .    from the point of view of field theory",
    "this process is a supersymmetric variant of the higgs mechanism . as we wander about the moduli space of vector multiplets it is possible that some hypermultiplets suddenly become massless .",
    "indeed , strominger @xcite noted that the singularities in the moduli space metric associated to a conifold are exactly the same as seen by seiberg and witten when a hypermultiplet becomes massless .",
    "suppose @xmath27 hypermultiplets become massless and that these hypermultiplets are charged under @xmath370 of the @xmath158 gauge symmetries in our original theory .",
    "we may try to give these new hypermultiplets vacuum expectation values which would then spontaneously break this @xmath372 gauge symmetry .",
    "our @xmath0 gauge theory in four dimensions has the standard gauge theory couplings and so these broken gauge symmetries must `` eat up '' some goldstone bosons in order to become massive .",
    "what s more they must do this in a way consistent with @xmath0 supersymmetry .",
    "the only way this can happen is for us to lose @xmath370 of our @xmath27 new massless hypermultiplets leaving us with @xmath365 new hypermultiplets .",
    "this is the field theory picture for losing @xmath370 vector multiplets and gaining @xmath365 hypermultiplets .",
    "since we obtain @xmath363 via the higgs mechanism , this is often referred to as the `` higgs phase '' .",
    "since @xmath356 has more @xmath158 s ( massless photons ) it is referred to as the `` coulomb phase '' .",
    "that is , the higgs phase is the one with more hypermultiplets and the coulomb phase is the one with more vector multiplets .",
    "the conifold transition is just the simplest example of all kinds of extremal transitions which may occur .",
    "the higgs phase transition of the preceding section was a little boring because there was no nonabelian gauge symmetry at the phase transition point .",
    "we know how to get enhanced gauge symmetry ( at least in some limit ) from section [ sss : ym ] . we need to consider the type iia string compactified on @xmath5 , where @xmath5 has a curve of ade singularities .",
    "this is easy to arrange using the elliptic fibration language of section [ sss : d=6 ] .",
    "we can describe the situation using the `` weierstrass form '' of the elliptic fibration which is standard when discussing f - theory .",
    "let @xmath185 and @xmath149 be affine complex coordinates on some patch of the base @xmath331 .",
    "we may then write the elliptic fibration as @xmath373 the discriminant is then given by @xmath374 .",

    "the final column denotes the resulting singularity _",
    "if all the components of the fibre not intersecting the section are shrunk down to zero area_. note that the fibres @xmath337 , @xmath381 and ii only have one component and thus can not produce a singularity .",
    "this results in an explicit description of an extremal transition involving nonabelian gauge symmetry .",
    "begin with a type iia string on a smooth  threefold @xmath5 where all the components of all the fibres have nonzero area .",
    "now shrink down all the components of the fibres which do not hit the section .",
    "this will result in curves of ade singularities producing some gauge group @xmath382 . we may then be free to deform the discriminant by a deformation of complex structure to smooth the threefold .",
    "let us recast this transition in terms of the language of a heterotic string compactified on @xmath153 .",
    "the process begins by a deformation of the khler form of @xmath5 which is thus a deformation of the bundle over @xmath215 ( or @xmath215 itself ) .",
    "that is , we vary wilson lines over @xmath215 .",
    "we then obtain the gauge group @xmath382 by switching these lines `` off '' .",
    "the deformation of complex structure of @xmath5 then corresponds to deforming the bundle over the k3 surface @xmath160 to reabsorb the enhanced gauge symmetry @xmath382 into a bundle .",
    "this extremal transition therefore appears as reducing the structure group of the bundle @xmath173 and increasing the structure group of @xmath383 .",
    "we begin in the `` coulomb '' branch where @xmath382 is broken to its cartan subgroup @xmath384 .",
    "we end up in the `` higgs '' branch where @xmath382 may be completely broken .",
    "this process therefore decreases the number of vector multiplets as one would expect .    an interesting point to bear in mind",
    "is that the gauge group @xmath382 can be broken by quantum effects , i.e. , effects due to @xmath156-corrections in the heterotic string and @xmath83-corrections ( specifically worldsheet instantons wrapped around the base @xmath193 ) in the type iia string . even though @xmath382 is broken however it does not mean that the phase transition can not happen .",
    "quantum effects can not obstruct motion in the moduli space and these extremal transitions most certainly exist in terms of threefolds .",
    "what tends to happen , as explained in @xcite , is that the phase transition point does not happen at a point of enhanced gauge symmetry ( which need not exist ) but rather at a point where some solitons become massless .",
    "only if quantum effects are ignored would these solitons actually produce the enhanced gauge symmetry .    in a particularly interesting class of examples",
    "the extremal transition can become more complicated .",
    "one may have more than one higgs phase joining on to the coulomb branch .",
    "this is actually understood both in terms of field theory and in terms of the geometry of threefolds .",
    "an example of a field theory with two higgs branches was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the geometry was explained in @xcite based on an earlier observation by gross @xcite .    as mentioned above , when we go to the six - dimensional picture of this field theory",
    ", the degrees of freedom associated to the areas of the elliptic fibration @xmath330 become frozen .",
    "that is , the vector supermultiplets associated to the above gauge groups lose their moduli .",
    "because of this we lose the coulomb branch of the theory .",
    "in other words there are special points in @xmath86 where we may acquire enhanced gauge symmetry but there is never any phase transition associated with such events .",
    "having said that we lose the standard higgs - coulomb phase transitions associated to enhanced gauge symmetry when we look at six dimensional @xmath326 theories , one may ask if we have any transitions at all .",
    "there are indeed still interesting phase transitions in six dimensions as was explained in @xcite .",
    "going to the six dimensional decompactification limit of the four dimensional theories may freeze out the khler form degrees of freedom associated to the fibres of @xmath330 , but there are still khler degrees of freedom remaining within @xmath331 itself .",
    "since these degrees of freedom are present as moduli in six dimensions and descend to vector multiplet moduli in four dimensions , they must be associated to scalars living in the six - dimensional _ tensor _ multiplets @xcite .",
    "note that the scalar fields in tensor multiplets have only one real degree of freedom .",
    "there is no modulus associated to varying the @xmath198-field on @xmath331 .",
    "effectively the periodicity of @xmath198 tends to zero as we decompactify the four dimensional theory to six dimensions .",
    "the geometry of the tensor moduli space is given by the real special khler geometry of section [ sss : bc ] .",
    "the six - dimensional phase transitions are then between a phase spanned by hypermultiplets , which we still call the higgs phase , and a phase spanned by tensor multiplets , which is called the coulomb phase for consistency with the four - dimensional picture .    in terms of f",

    "consider an elliptic fibration whose local weierstrass form is @xmath385 this has a type @xmath386 fibre running along @xmath377 and so one would associate this to an @xmath387 gauge group . at @xmath357",
    "something special happens .",
    "the elliptic fibration degenerates so badly that the only fibre that would smooth the space out would actually be complex dimension two rather than some algebraic curve . to avoid this",
    "one may blow up the point @xmath388 in the base to introduce a new rational curve into @xmath331 .",
    "one is certainly not always free to do this ! blowing up any old point in @xmath331 would usually result in breaking the condition .",
    "it is only because ( [ eq : xi1 ] ) is so singular that one can do this .",
    "the form ( [ eq : xi1 ] ) is therefore precisely at the phase transition point .",

    "if we assume that @xmath391 ( for any space @xmath365 ) is equivalent to a @xmath365-fibration over @xmath195 as far as areas are concerned then this simple dimensional reduction argument reproduces proposition [ prop : hbase ] .",
    "it also implies that _ the coupling of the type iia string is determined by the area of the section of the k3 surface @xmath160 , as an elliptic fibration , on which the heterotic string is compactified_.    we will assume this statement is true even though this argument considerably lacks rigour .",

    "this will eliminate @xmath156-corrections on the type iia side . now in order to remove the @xmath83-corrections on the heterotic side we are required to make the k3 surface @xmath160 very large . since we have made the section of @xmath160 large we have already fulfilled this requirement partially .",
    "if we assume that @xmath160 is a completely generic elliptic k3 surface with a section , then the only other area we need care about is that of the generic elliptic fibre . if both the section and the fibre have large area then every minimal 2-cycle in @xmath160 will be large , unless we have chosen to be close to a special point in the moduli space of ricci - flat metrics where a 2-cycle shrinks down to zero size",
    "how exactly we take the area of the generic fibre of @xmath160 to be infinite was first explained in @xcite following an observation in @xcite .",

    "we will approach this problem as an algebraic geometer would . for",
    "a discussion of the link of this approach with a more metric - minded picture see @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that taking the areas of the fibres of @xmath160 to be large corresponds to a deformation of complex structure of @xmath5 .",

    "we may construct this by considering a one - dimensional family of @xmath5 s .",

    "it is @xmath397 which will correspond to @xmath160 with a generic elliptic fibre of infinite area .      in order to proceed",
    "further we need to specify whether we are talking about the @xmath7 heterotic string or the @xmath8 heterotic string .",
    "we will deal with the @xmath7 case first .",
    "a picture of what happens as @xmath5 turns into @xmath397 is depicted in figure [ fig : sdeg ] for the case of the @xmath7 heterotic string .",
    "what happens is that the  threefold @xmath5 `` breaks in two '' to give a reducible space @xmath398 intersecting along a complex surface @xmath399 .",

    "the surface @xmath399 is in fact a k3 surface and is isomorphic to @xmath160 !",
    "the way one shows this is via an adiabatic argument where one thinks of @xmath160 as a slowly - varying elliptic fibration .",
    "one then focuses attention on one elliptic fibre and pretends that the heterotic string compactified on this single fibre is dual to f - theory on a k3 surface .",
    "such an adiabatic argument might be considered a little dangerous when trying to obtain exact results .",
    "the fact that we indeed recover a k3 surface @xmath399 in the stable degeneration shows that the result is in fact exact . the only way of mapping the moduli space of @xmath160 onto the moduli space of @xmath399 is to identify them with each other !",
    "having determined the heterotic k3 surface @xmath160 from the degeneration @xmath401 , we should now like to determine the bundle data @xmath402 .",

    "the `` lost '' r - r degrees of freedom which are not invariant around the stable degeneration @xmath396 can be matched up with the deformations of @xmath160 which kill the elliptic fibration and/or the section @xcite .",

    "3 .   we may acquire ade singularities in @xmath160 and let point - like instantons collide with these singularities .",
    "all possible cases were determined in @xcite .",
    "for example , a collection of @xmath414 point - like @xmath387 instantons on a @xmath415 ( that is , type @xmath416 ) quotient singularity , where @xmath417 , yields @xmath414 new tensor directions in the coulomb branch and a local contribution to the gauge symmetry of @xmath418 one may show that the case @xmath419 reduces to the case obtained by replacing @xmath420 with the integer part of @xmath421 .",

    "many possibilities were discussed in @xcite .",

    "no new massless tensors appear .    by counting point - like instantons",
    "one may also arrive at the following @xcite ( see also @xcite for more details )    a type iia string compactified on an elliptic fibration ( with section ) over the hirzebruch surface @xmath334 is dual to an @xmath7 heterotic string compactified on @xmath428 where @xmath429 .",

    "so they must give massless fields which remain massless when we try to use the fields to move in the moduli space .",

    "see @xcite for an example of this . why the geometry of   threefolds should know about these anomalies",
    "is currently a mystery .",
    "since we have discussed many of the peculiar properties of the classical limit of an @xmath323 heterotic string on various bundles on a k3 surface , we should now be able to have just as much fun with the @xmath8 heterotic string .",
    "unfortunately at the present point in time there has been less attention paid to this string , at least in the context of f - theory .",
    "having said that the @xmath8 string is more amenable to analysis in terms of open strings  the @xmath8 is believed to be dual to the type i open string .",
    "this allows @xmath187-brane technology to be used as was done in @xcite .",
    "there is a stable degeneration in the @xmath8 case but it is quite different to the @xmath7 case @xcite .",
    "this time , the elliptic fibres break in half as opposed to the base .",
    "a generic elliptic fibre becomes two rational curves intersecting at two points ( i.e. , an @xmath436 fibre in kodaira s notation ) as depicted in figure  [ fig : sdegs ] . at some of the fibres",
    "these two rational curves only intersect at a single point .",
    "thus @xmath5 becomes a reducible space @xmath437 where @xmath438 is a double cover of the base branched over some subspace .",
    "this intersection is again a k3 surface which we take to be equivalent to @xmath160 .",
    "another difference between the @xmath439 heterotic string and the @xmath8 heterotic string is that in the latter case the bundle data has yet to be elucidated .",
    "determining the exact way the @xmath8 vector bundle data is encoded in @xmath440 and @xmath441 may not be particularly difficult and is a problem which should be investigated .",

    "we may deform a smooth vector bundle so that all of its curvature is concentrated at points .",
    "the fundamental such point has @xmath413 and is known as a `` point - like instanton '' @xcite .",

    "2 .   we may acquire ade singularities in @xmath160 .",
    "if the bundle is suitably generic in this case nothing interesting happens .",
    "3 .   we may acquire ade singularities in @xmath160 and let point - like instantons collide with these singularities .",
    "all possible cases were determined in @xcite .",
    "for example , consider a collection of @xmath414 point - like @xmath8 instantons on a @xmath415 ( that is , type @xmath416 ) quotient singularity . if @xmath420 is even and @xmath417",
    ", then we have @xmath443 new tensor directions in the coulomb branch and a local contribution to the gauge symmetry of @xmath444 if @xmath420 is odd and @xmath445 , then we have @xmath446 new tensor directions in the coulomb branch and a local contribution to the gauge symmetry of @xmath447 for smaller values of @xmath414 we refer to @xcite .",
    "4 .   suppose we put a point - like instanton with @xmath36 monodromy on an @xmath263 singularity such that @xmath8 in broken to @xmath448 .",
    "a minimal such instanton has @xmath413 and gives no new gauge symmetry or tensors @xcite .",
    "one may produce a peculiar point - like instanton called a `` hidden obstructer '' which may live anywhere in @xmath160 , has @xmath449 , and produces a massless tensor leading to a coulomb phase @xcite .",
    "again by counting point - like instantons one may arrive at the following @xcite    a type iia string compactified on an elliptic fibration ( with section ) over the hirzebruch surface @xmath334 is dual to a @xmath8 heterotic string compactified on @xmath428 with @xmath450 hidden obstructers and where @xmath451 .",
    "so far we have danced around the edges of the moduli space @xmath86 where we may ignore both the @xmath83-corrections to the heterotic moduli space and the @xmath156-corrections of the type ii moduli space .",
    "surprisingly little is known about what happens if one ventures into the interior of the moduli space .",
    "we collect here briefly the few known results .",
    "we already mentioned this in section [ sss : d=3 ] . in effect",
    "we may look at the `` first order '' behaviour as we move away from the classical limit .    in any of the examples where we had a perturbative gauge symmetry we may ask what happens if we allow this theory to interact ( i.e. , allow some coupling or some effective scale @xmath296 to be nonzero ) while keeping the effective gravitational coupling zero .",
    "this would lead to a field theory limit which is described by a hyperkhler moduli space .",
    "this is the `` rigid limit '' of the quaternionic khler manifold in the same sense as we had a rigid special khler limit of a special khler manifold .",
    "proposition [ prop : sw3 ] by seiberg and witten gives a powerful tool in this respect .    in terms of the heterotic compactification picture",
    "we go to the hyperkhler limit by rescaling the overall size of @xmath160 to infinity . in order to get something interesting we simultaneously scale down some minimal 2-spheres to keep their areas finite .",
    "the result is that we end up describing a heterotic string on an ale space .",
    "the analysis of such systems is perhaps best done by using various dualities involving d - branes along the lines of @xcite .",
    "because of this we will regard this subject as beyond the scope of these lectures .",
    "we will give one interesting result however .",
    "suppose one were to consider perhaps the simplest case of @xmath414 point - like instantons moving around an ale space of type @xmath452 .",
    "one can then show @xcite that the resulting hyperkhler moduli space with @xmath453 quaternionic dimensions is the same as you would get from the @xmath350-map of section [ sss : d=3 ] applied to the rigid limit of @xmath46 for a theory with gauge symmetry @xmath454 .",
    "in other words , suppose our desired moduli space is the hyperkhler limit of @xmath86 which is given by the type iia string on @xmath5 .",
    "then the type iia string compactified on @xmath6 , the mirror of @xmath5 , would yield a gauge symmetry of @xmath454 .    we know from section [ sss : e8l ] that when we go to the classical limit of this theory we will get a gauge group of the form ( [ eq : gan ] ) .",
    "that is , we are in the higgs branch of a field theory associated to the gauge group ( [ eq : gan ] ) .    from section [ sss : d=3",
    "] this implies that in the three - dimensional picture , mirror symmetry exchanges a field theory with gauge group @xmath454 with a field theory with gauge group given by ( [ eq : gan ] ) .",
    "this is a statement of `` intriligator  seiberg mirror symmetry '' .",
    "see @xcite for many examples of such mirror pairs and @xcite for further discussion of this example .",
    "clearly analysis of this hyperkhler limit is much easier than a discussion of the quaternionic khler @xmath86 in its full glory .",
    "this is essentially because one ends up studying field theory ( without gravity ) rather than full string theory .",
    "both the type iia and type iib strings suffer from @xmath156-corrections when studying @xmath86 .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that one could study the associated instantons by considering maps of certain cycles into the  space .",
    "these cycles represent the world - volume of d - brane solitons . in a way therefore these @xmath156-corrections could be modeled by something that looks like a generalization of worldsheet instantons .    in the case of a the type iia string on a  space @xmath5",
    ", one needs to consider `` supersymmetric '' or `` special lagrangian '' minimal 3-cycles embedded in @xmath5 .",
    "( on a related note , such 3-cycles have also achieved prominence from the mirror conjecture of @xcite . ) because counting these 3-cycles is very difficult , this approach to computing the quantum corrections has not to date been very useful .",
    "indeed , it will probably be easier to compute the quantum corrections in some other way and then use this to predict the number of 3-cycles  just as was done for rational curves .    for the type iib string ,",
    "the instanton @xmath156-corrections come from _",
    "even_-dimensional cycles in @xmath6 , including rational curves .",
    "remember that we also have worldsheet instanton corrections coming from rational curves in @xmath6 .",
    "thus it would appear at first that in order to compute the quantum corrections to @xmath86 we should count the rational curves in terms of worldsheet instantons and then add to this the contribution of rational curves from d-1-brane worldsheets .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this is not the full story .",
    "the subtleties of our discussion of quantum corrections in section [ ss : who ] turn out to have real significance .",
    "we only really understand worldsheet instantons when @xmath455 and we only understand the d - brane instantons when @xmath456 .",
    "we have no right to trust either of these pictures when we set both @xmath156 and @xmath83 to be nonzero .    by analyzing a heterotic string on @xmath153 which is dual to the type iib string on @xmath6",
    ", one may show that there are many quantum corrections which correspond to instantons which depend on many different combinations of @xmath83 and @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "it is as if we had instantons which are both worldsheet and spacetime simultaneously .",
    "one very rough way of saying what happens is that the type iib string in ten dimensions has an @xmath180 symmetry which permutes the fundamental string with `` @xmath457-strings '' for any relatively prime @xmath457 .",
    "one then needs to add up the contribution from instantons from all of these @xmath457-strings . on closer inspection this description as it stands",
    "is flawed .",
    "firstly , s - duality , like any u - duality , is broken when we have only modestly extended supersymmetry .",
    "this was shown explicitly for the type iib string on @xmath6 in @xcite .",
    "secondly we do not really have a formulation of @xmath457-strings which allows one to make much sense of a computation of instanton corrections .",
    "understanding these mixed instanton corrections may be one of the most challenging problems for our current definitions of string theory",
    ". it may be that we need to replace our basic formulation of string theory to be able to make sense of this problem .",
    "we will close our discussion of the hypermultiplet moduli space by further demonstrating how troublesome analysis of @xmath86 can be .",
    "we want to analyze the question of whether the dilaton belongs to some special hypermultiplet which may have some universal properties for any @xmath86 .",
    "we will begin by a quick review of some general facts about quaternionic geometry .",
    "it is well - known that we may put patches of complex coordinates on a complex manifold @xmath458 .",
    "that is , we may take some open neighbourhood in @xmath458 with a homeomorphism to some open subset of @xmath459 .",
    "then do this for a collection of patches covering @xmath458 such that the coordinates are related by elements of @xmath460 between patches .",
    "we may also consider complex _",
    "submanifolds _ of @xmath458 .",
    "the patches on such submanifolds map holomorphically to the patches of @xmath458 .",
    "unfortunately this does not work at all as nicely for quaternionic khler manifolds @xmath461 .",
    "we refer to section 14.f of @xcite for more details and references .",
    "one might suppose that one could consider patches homeomorphic to an open subset of @xmath462 such that these coordinates were related by elements of @xmath463 .",
    "we multiply by @xmath327 on the left and by @xmath464 on the right to try to match the holonomy structure discussed in section [ ss : hol ]",
    ". these would be patches of `` quaternionic coordinates '' . unfortunately the only spaces which can admit such a structure are necessarily locally projectively equivalent to quaternionic projection space @xmath465 @xcite .",
    "the hypermultiplet moduli spaces one encounters in string theory are not expected to be of this specific form . in other words",
    "we would not expect the quaternionic structure of @xmath86 to be `` integrable '' .",
    "for a typical @xmath86 one can not think in terms of quaternionic coordinates . while it is true that the scalars in a hypermultiplet give a quaternion , these scalars only give _ tangent directions _ in the moduli space .",
    "there is no way to integrate such a quaternionic structure a nonzero distance along such directions . in other words",
    "if one tries to start at a generic point in space and then integrate along the tangent directions given by the 4 massless scalars of a chosen hypermultiplet then one will lose the hypermultiplet structure .",
    "the four scalars one ends up with will not be mapped purely into each other by the @xmath327 @xmath9-symmetry .",
    "there is also generically a lack of existence of quaternionic submanifolds in a generic quaternionic khler manifold , by which we mean the following . if one considers the tangent bundle at a given point @xmath86 one can certainly see a quaternionic structure .",
    "one may pick a quaternionic subspace of this and try to integrate along these quaternionic directions to map out a submanifold . after integrating a nonzero distance",
    "one will generically discover that one has rotated out of the desired quaternionic structure . in other words , the @xmath327 part of the holonomy will no longer have a closed action within the new tangent directions .",
    "having said this , if one chooses the starting point and tangent directions carefully one can sometimes integrate to find closed manifolds which _ are _ compatible with the quaternionic structure .",
    "we may call such rare objects quaternionic submanifolds .",
    "we emphasize that finding quaternionic submanifolds of a quaternionic manifold is a _ much _ harder problem than finding complex submanifolds of a complex manifold .    in @xcite",
    "the notion of a `` universal hypermultiplet '' was introduced .",
    "if one ignores @xmath156-corrections to a type ii compactification one might argue from the conformal field theory that the hypermultiplet in which the dilaton lives somehow decouples from the rest of the theory .",
    "if this were the case then one could find this universal hypermultiplet by studying any particularly simple example .",
    "consider compactifying the type ii string on a 6-torus to obtain a theory in four dimensions with @xmath466 supersymmetry .",
    "now imagine what would happen to the moduli space if one embedded the @xmath467 @xmath9-symmetry of @xmath0 into the @xmath468 @xmath9-symmetry of @xmath466 .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that this leads to a natural embedding @xmath469 the right - hand - side is therefore a possible moduli space for an @xmath0 system ( embedded in an @xmath466 system ) .",
    "clearly the first factor would be @xmath46 and the second factor would be @xmath86 . this would suggest that if a universal hypermultiplet exists it must be of the form @xmath470 .",
    "even this simplest of examples shows that one can not expect the universal hypermultiplet to appear as a _ factor _ in the moduli space .",
    "equation ( [ eq:8to2 ] ) represents an embedding of the universal hypermultiplet into the moduli space which does not factorize .",
    "one should therefore immediately question the validity of saying that the dilaton can be decoupled in a special way from the other fields ( even when quantum effects are ignored ) .",
    "one might argue that the failure of the universal hypermultiplet to appear as a factor might be due to an excess of supersymmetry in the above example .",
    "this is not so as we see shortly .",
    "the best we might hope for then is that the dilaton lives in a hypermultiplet which can be integrated at least at some special points in @xmath86 to give a quaternionic submanifold of dimension one .",
    "let us consider a class of genuine @xmath0 examples .",
    "we know from the heterotic string that there are many cases where @xmath86 can be described asymptotically ( as the k3 surface gets large ) by the moduli space of k3 surfaces with bundles . in many of these cases",
    "we may freeze the bundle moduli as well as some of the deformations of the k3 itself by pushing point - like instantons into singularities and moving off in the corresponding coulomb branch .",
    "an example of this was studied in @xcite .",
    "this implies that many examples of @xmath86 look asymptotically like @xmath471 for some @xmath208 and some lattice @xmath472 .",
    "indeed in a few special examples such as @xcite there are no quantum corrections and this moduli space is exact ( see @xcite for the classification of this type of example ) .",
    "now it is known @xcite that any quaternionic submanifold of @xmath86 must be totally geodesic . from an old result of e.  cartan ,",
    "the totally geodesic submanifolds of a symmetric space are always determined by lie triples which have been classified ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "this will actually allow for an embedding of the universal hypermultiplet ( assuming @xmath473 ) : @xmath474 note however that ( [ eq : my - u ] ) does not factorize in any way .",
    "this embedding relies very much on the special properties of symmetric spaces .",
    "the question we should address however is whether this delicate embedding can be expected to remain when @xmath156-corrections are taken into account .",
    "if the deformation of @xmath86 produced by these quantum corrections is sufficiently generic then this embedding will be destroyed even if we were to allow for deformations of the universal hypermultiplet itself .",
    "until we know more about @xmath156-corrections this is impossible to address but for now it would seem to be most prudent to assume that any notion of a universal hypermultiplet , even if only as a quaternionic submanifold of @xmath86 rather than a factor , should be doubted .",
    "since it was the quaternionic structure that caused problems above one might consider an alternative approach to finding the dilaton without trying to keep it cooped up in a special hypermultiplet .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that ( [ eq : my - u ] ) is the universal behaviour of @xmath86 in the weakly - coupled limit .",
    "we can then try something like a decomposition of this symmetric space along the lines of @xcite into a warped product such as @xmath475 where we have pulled the dilaton out as the @xmath476 factor .",
    "actually this decomposition is well - suited to understanding the stable degenerations of section [ ss : hclas ] .",
    "we leave it as an interesting exercise for the reader to interpret each factor ( although see @xcite for hints ! ) .",
    "of course , this symmetric space is only the asymptotic form of the moduli space @xmath86 .",
    "the quantum corrections will make everything much more difficult to analyze .",
    "clearly we have much about @xmath86 to learn !",
    "it is a pleasure to thank r.  bryant , d.  morrison , r.  plesser and e.  sharpe for numerous conversations and collaborations on topics covered in these lectures .",
