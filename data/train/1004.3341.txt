    "since 1998 , the type ia supernova ( sne ia ) observations @xcite have showed that the expansion of our universe is speeding up rather than slowing down . during these years from that time , many additional observational results , including current cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy measurement from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , and the data of the large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite , also strongly support this suggestion . in order to understand the mechanism of the accelerating expansion of the universe",
    ", the common recognition has been received that there exists an exotic energy component with negative pressure , called dark energy ( de ) , whose density accounts for two - thirds of the total energy density in the universe according to the current observations .",
    "it has been the most important thing to make an effort to probe into what the nature of de is in the modern cosmology .",
    "the simplest and naturalest candidate is the cosmological constant @xmath6 ( vacuum energy ) @xcite , with the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath7 .",
    "however , it s pity that it confronts with two difficulties : the fine - tuning problem and the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "an alternative offer is the dynamical de to alleviate the difficulties above , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintom @xcite , generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model @xcite , holographic de @xcite , and so on .    at present , although in the presence of numerous dark energy models , the concordance model still fits best well with the current combined observations @xcite .",
    "so it s necessary to review the cosmic constant problems : the fine - tuning problem is the vacuum energy density predicted by quantum field theory ( qfc ) is @xmath8 , which is about @xmath9 orders of magnitude larger than the observed value @xmath10 , so there must be so - called `` fine - tuning '' while looking for an balance between two numbers which exits so much discrepancy . the cosmic coincidence problem says : since the energy densities of vacuum energy and dark matter turn on different evolutions during the expansion history of the universe , why are they nearly equal today and why it happens just now ? to get this coincidence , it appears that their ratio must be set to a specific , infinitesimal value in the very early universe .",
    "therefore , in nature the second difficulty is also `` fine - tuning '' problem . in the final analysis ,",
    "both of the two difficulties are related to the energy density of vacuum energy .",
    "on the basis of this consideration , a phenomenological and natural attempt at alleviating the above problems is allowing vacuum energy @xmath11 to vary @xcite . in @xmath4 model , we keep unvaried for the eos of the vacuum energy , equaling to @xmath12 , and have an time - evolving energy density .",
    "although the weak point in this ideology is the unknown functional form of the @xmath13 parameter , we can deal with the @xmath13 parameter by different phenomenologically parameterized form , referring to @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the underly explanation for @xmath13 parameter has also been explored in the framework of qft using the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the isw effect @xcite arises from a time - dependent gravitational potential at late time and leads to cmb temperature anisotropies . from the physical picture point of view",
    ", the frequency of the photon released by cmb has been redshifted or blueshifted , which is caused by the decaying gravitational potential , while propagating along the line of light - like from the last scattering surface to now .",
    "the isw effect is a significant implication for dark energy .",
    "since the gravitational potential was an constant during matter - dominated . at the late time",
    ", the gravitational potential is time - dependent when dark energy begin to dominate in the universe .",
    "so , the detection of isw effect will provide great support and more information for dark energy .",
    "now , the isw effect is detected by the cross - correlation between cmb and lss observations @xcite . in this way",
    ", we can separate cmb temperature anisotropies caused by isw effect from the primary temperature anisotropies .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the time varying vacuum model , where a parameterized form of @xmath13 is used .",
    "the densities of dark matter and vacuum energy do nt conserve independently owing to the time varying vacuum term , which plays the role of the interaction between dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the matter production term leads to the different evolutions of the hubble parameter @xmath1 and the dimensionless matter density @xmath2 , and the different structure formation , comparing with the concordance model .",
    "meanwhile , there being a relation between these three quantities and the source term of the isw effect , we explore the impact from the change of these three quantities on isw effect in the @xmath4 model in theory .    the paper is organized as follows . in next section ,",
    "we briefly review of the cosmological evolution and structure growth in time varying vacuum model . in section iii , we focus on the theory and detection of isw effect and its power spectrum . the last section is the conclusion .",
    "considering a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) cosmological model , which consists of two components : the dark matter and the dynamic de . with",
    "the metric @xmath14 $ ] , the friedmann equation and energy - momentum conservation equation can be written as @xmath15 where , @xmath16 is the hubble parameter and @xmath17 is the reduced planck mass . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are density and pressure of a general piece of matter , and their subscripts @xmath20 and @xmath11 respectively correspond to dark matter and dark energy .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the time vacuum energy as dynamic dark energy with energy density @xmath21 . in order to simplify the formalism , we work in the framework of geometrical units with @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we can obtain the vacuum energy density @xmath23 and the corresponding equation of state @xmath24 . then the equation ( 2 )",
    "reads @xmath25 which shows that the decaying vacuum density @xmath13 plays the role of a source of matter production , and the densities of dark matter and vacuum energy do nt conserve independently .",
    "now , we consider a parameterized form using a power series of @xmath13 @xcite , this is : @xmath26 combining the equations ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we can get the following hubble function : @xmath27 where we have defined @xmath28 . then with the definition of hubble function @xmath29",
    ", we proceed with the integration , deriving the evolution of the scale factor of the universe @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the constant of integration . considering the two equations above",

    "in addition , we can get the comoving distance @xmath40 from the solution of the hubble function @xmath1 according to its definition of the integration : @xmath41    in the following , we consider the structure growth in the framework of time varying vacuum model .",

    "on account of the presence of @xmath44 , it s seen that equation ( 12 ) is different from the well - known linear matter perturbation equation .",
    "there are two solutions to the differential equation ( 12 ) , where one is a growing mode and the other is a decaying mode .",
    "since almost all current models of the universe have a non - increasing hubble rate , we are interested in the growing one , which is given by @xcite : @xmath46    next , we constrain the @xmath47 model parameter @xmath48 according to the growth rate of clustering : @xmath49    .the currently available observational data for the growth rate of clustering and its measurement uncertainty .",
