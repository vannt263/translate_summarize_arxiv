    "dust plays an important role in the observed properties of galaxies .",
    "it not only causes galaxies to dim but also causes them to redden . in order to obtain the intrinsic properties of galaxies from observation ,",
    "it is necessary to understand dust extinction .",
    "dust extinction is believed to be more important in late - type spiral galaxies than in early - type galaxies , since spiral galaxies are richer in cold gas and have on - going star formation ( e.g. calzetti 2001 for a review and references therein ) .",
    "dust opacity in spiral disks can be probed by studying the average photometric properties of spiral galaxies as a function of disk inclination angle , as first suggested by holmberg ( 1958 , 1975 ) .",
    "theoretically , it can be shown that , for completely opaque disks , the surface brightness to be observed is almost independent of inclination angle , while the luminosity dims as the inclination angle changes from face - on to edge - on . on the other hand , for completely transparent disks , the luminosity is independent of inclination while the surface brightness brightens as the disk changes from face - on to edge - on . however , the power of the holmberg test is limited by the finite sizes of galaxy samples , because it is in general difficult to accurately estimate the inclination angles for individual galaxies . the axis ratios of galaxy images are usually used to estimate the inclination angles . for an infinitesimally thin and round disk ,",
    "the inclination angle @xmath10 can be obtained directly from the axis ratio @xmath11 through @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , real disks are neither completely round nor infinitesimally thin , and the observed axis ratio depends not only on the inclination angle but also on the ellipticity and thickness of the galaxy .",
    "unless such dependence is fully taken into account , the results from the holmberg test can not be interpreted straightforwardly .",
    "in addition , the test based on the average photometric properties of galaxies as functions of inclination angle may be further complicated by the incompleteness and selection bias of galaxy sample . for example , if disk galaxies are optically thin , a galaxy sample may be biased for low - luminosity galaxies with high inclinations because of the the enhanced surface brightness . with such selection bias",
    ", face - on galaxies will on average be brighter than edge - on galaxies , which may be falsely interpreted as the disks being optically thick . because of these limitations , the conclusion about the opacity of the disk galaxies are still controversial ( e.g. burstein haynes & faber 1991 ; byun 1993 ; giovanelli et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ; xilouris et al . 1999 ; masters , giovanelli & haynes 2003 ; holwerda et al . 2005 ) .    with a large and well - defined sample ,",
    "the above - mentioned difficulties in the holmberg test can in principle be overcome .",
    "as shown in ryden ( 2004 ) , a large sample allows one to estimate the thickness and ellipticity robustly from the distribution of axis ratios in a statistical way .",
    "moreover , with a large , well - defined sample , one can study the conditional distribution functions of photometric properties for given inclination angles , instead of just considering the mean photometric properties of galaxies .",
    "thus , the selection bias and sample incompleteness can be taken into account strictly in a statistical sense . with the advent of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is now possible to make such analysis .    in this paper , we use the sdss galaxy sample to study dust extinctions in spiral galaxies . our analysis is based on the luminosity function ( hereafter lf ) of galaxies as a function of inclination angles .",
    "we statistically correct the axis ratios of galaxy images to obtain their inclination angles based on the method of ryden ( 2004 ) .",
    "we compare the change of lf with inclination angle in different wavebands to constrain the shape of the dust extinction curve .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the selection of sample is described in ",
    "[ sec : sample ] and quantities to specify the inclinations of galaxies are discussed in   [ sec : inclination ] . in ",
    "[ sec : lf ] , after a brief description of the lf estimators adopted in this paper (   [ sec : estimator ] ) , we present the results of the lfs in all the 5 sdss bands for galaxies of different inclination angles (   [ sec : result ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : ide ] , the inclination - dependence of the lf is modelled in terms of dust extinction . the possible luminosity dependence of the dust extinction and the dust - corrected lf of spiral galaxies are discussed in   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the galaxy samples we used were selected from the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc , blanton et al . , 2005 ) of the sdss second data release ( dr2 , abazajian et al .",
    "the redshift catalog of the dr2 covers 2,627 deg@xmath13 of the celestial sphere and photometric data in the 5 sdss wave bands , @xmath9 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath7 , are available for each of the galaxies ( abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) directly from the sdss pipeline .",
    "the nyu - vagc includes additional information for extragalactic targets , such as @xmath17-correction , spectroscopic target completeness , etc .. from the nyu - vagc , we select spiral galaxies with @xmath18 , where the photometric parameter @xmath19 is a point spread function ( psf ) corrected indicator of galaxy morphology . in the sdss pipeline , each galaxy was fitted by an exponential profile and a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "the best linear combination of these two profiles was used to represent the profile of the galaxy , and @xmath19 is the fraction of luminosity contributed by the de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "bernardi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used @xmath20 to select early - type galaxies .",
    "we use @xmath21 to ensure that the galaxies we select are dominated by the exponential component .    to construct samples to study the lfs of galaxies ,",
    "both redshift and flux limits are applied .",
    "only galaxies with redshift in the range @xmath22 are selected .",
    "the upper limit is imposed to minimize the uncertainty in the @xmath17-correction and possible redshift evolutions of galaxies ; the lower limit is employed to avoid the nearest galaxies with large uncertainties of distance caused by peculiar velocities . a flux limit in @xmath15 band , @xmath23 , is chosen to ensure the completeness in spectroscopy .",
    "for other wave bands , the flux limits are chosen to be sufficiently high , so that almost all of the galaxies ( @xmath24 ) brighter than the limit in the band in consideration have @xmath15-band flux brighter than @xmath25 mag .",
    "the flux limits of all 5 bands we use and the numbers of galaxies in the corresponding samples are listed in table  [ tab : limits ] .",
    "note that we use the petrosian ( 1976 ) magnitude to refer the luminosities of galaxies .",
    "this definition of magnitude has the advantage that it is a uniform measurement of flux quite independent of the distance of the target .",
    "furthermore , for an exponential profile the petrosian magnitude contains almost all of the flux of the source ( e.g. stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    ".the sample of galaxies in each sdss band [ cols=\"^,^,^ , > , > \" , ]",
    "using a samples of 61506 spiral galaxies selected from the sdss dr2 , we study the luminosity functions of spiral galaxies with different inclination angles . the apparent axis ratio , @xmath11 , is used as an observational inclination indicator to define subsamples of spiral galaxies at different inclinations , and we use a monte carlo process to connect @xmath11 to the corrected inclination angle , @xmath10 , disk thickness , @xmath26 , and ellipticity @xmath27 .",
    "there is a systematic change of the lf with inclination angle : the characteristic luminosity @xmath0 decreases with increasing inclination angle , while the faint - end slope depends only weakly on inclination .",
    "the inclination - angle dependence of the galaxy luminosity function is consistent with the expectation of a simple model where the optical depth is proportional to @xmath28 , and we use a likelihood method to recover both the amplitude of the extinction ( relative to the face - on value ) , @xmath2 , and the luminosity function for galaxies viewed face - on .",
    "we found that the results obtained from different methods are all consistent with each other , and the characteristic magnitude for face - on spirals is about @xmath29 magnitudes brighter than the average population .",
    "we found that the value of @xmath2 is quite independent of luminosity in a given band .",
    "the values of @xmath2 obtained in this way for the 5 sdss bands are used to constrain the shape of the extinction curve , assuming @xmath30 .",
    "we find @xmath31 .    using the @xmath7-band dust extinction given by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , together with the inclination - dependence of the lf we obtained , we derive an ` extinction - corrected ' luminosity function for spiral galaxies .",
    "dust extinction makes a significant change in @xmath5 , and the characteristic luminosity of the ` dust - corrected ' lf is about 0.5 to 1.2 magnitude brighter than the uncorrected lf from the @xmath7- to the @xmath9-bands .",
    "this suggests that the luminosity function of spiral galaxies may be significantly underestimated in blue bands , if internal dust correction is not made .",
    "this may have important implications when comparing model predictions of the luminosity function with observations .    as mentioned in the introduction , the dimming in luminosity from face - on to edge on",
    "is expected if galaxy disks are optically thick .",
    "our results therefore give support to the assumption that most of the disks in our galaxy sample are optically thick .",
    "note that the inclination - dependent dimming exists not only for faint galaxies but for galaxies over the entire luminosity range .",
    "note also that we are using a well - defined flux - limited sample and the selection bias is taken into account in the lf estimate .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the effect we find here is due to the magnitude limit in the sample .",
    "systematic effects of surface brightness relative to the inclination is also unlikely to play an important role here . as discussed in blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the surface - brightness limit used in the sdss has negligible effects on the lf at @xmath32 , and so the inclination - dependence of the lf at @xmath32 can not be explained as due to the miss of low - surface face - on galaxies .",
    "we therefore conclude that our results are best explained by assuming that bright disks are optically thick .",
