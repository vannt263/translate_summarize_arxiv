    "<S> , measurements of x - ray scattering in an individual cn are just provisional and such type of experiments could be first performed for a bulk material consisting of the ordered nanotubes . nowadays , a number of techniques to produce the films of oriented nanotubes have been developed . </S>",
    "<S> mostly aligned multiwall cns have been synthesized using a zeolite - supported catalyst @xcite , the lithography technique solee - apa02,te ... chpl98 , and mixtures of ferrocene and fullerene or hydrocarbon compounds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both the nanotube structure and the character of its ordering are varied as a function of the synthesis conditions .    as a starting point , </S>",
    "<S> a film of vertically aligned nanotubes , grown on a si substrate , was prepared by thermal chemical vapor deposition of a ferrocene / fullerene mixture . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical vapor deposition apparatus consists of a gas flow reactor and a tubular furnace ; the reactor is fitted with a removable quartz tube . </S>",
    "<S> a ceramic boat with a mixture of fullerene c@xmath1 and ferrocene fe(c@xmath2h@xmath2)@xmath3 , taken in the ratio of 1:1 , was placed inside the tube beyond a si 4@xmath410 mm@xmath5 plate . </S>",

    "<S> the mean length of nanotubes coincides with the film thickness of about 10 @xmath7 m . </S>",
    "<S> the nanotubes are rather closely packed and their density was estimated about 1000 pieces/@xmath7m@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a transmission electron microscope showed that the multiwall cns have from 5 up to 15 layers , the external diameter of @xmath8 10 @xmath9 20 nm and the inner channel diameter of @xmath8 4.0 @xmath9 6.0 nm . from the sem analysis </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the nanotubes are mostly ordered for an internal part of the film . in the beginning of the growth process </S>",
    "<S> the silicon surface with deposited iron particles ( as the catalyst ) , provides the alignment of cns . </S>",
    "<S> an upper part of the film ( 0.1 @xmath9 0.2 @xmath7 m thickness ) is the most disoriented due , perhaps , to the final growing features , when the concentration of fullerenes is lower .    </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependence of x - ray fluorescence from nanotube films was measured by means of a laboratory spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> a scheme of the sample location within a spectrometer chamber is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . the operating vacuum was 2@xmath410@xmath10 pa . in order to change the angle @xmath11 between the sample surface and the optical axis of spectrometer from 60@xmath6 to 100@xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , the sample of 8@xmath42 mm@xmath5 was fixed to the rotatable axis . </S>",
    "<S> positions of the cu anode of x - ray tube and the entrance slit were fixed . </S>",
    "<S> the angle between the radiation source , i.e. the anode surface of 6 mm width , and the rotating axis was 20@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> a gas proportional counter with methane pressure of 0.2@xmath410@xmath12 pa was placed beyond the slit . </S>",

    "<S> should be compared . </S>",
    "<S> random distribution of nanotubes was obtained by applying pressure to the nanostructure film . </S>",
    "<S> the complete disorientation of nanotubes with respect to the substrate surface was confirmed by the sem analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependences of x - ray fluorescence measured for the samples of ordered as well as chaotic nanotube distributions are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( curves 1 and 2 , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the count values were normalized by the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the curves show similar intensity dependence : increase at angles from 60@xmath6 up to 85@xmath6 and then decrease . </S>",
    "<S> the sample of aligned cns provides an additional contribution to the x - ray fluorescence spectrum near 90@xmath6 . for the sample of disordered nanotubes </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependence will be defined by geometrical parameters of the experimental layout and by absorption of the exciting and fluorescence beams . </S>",
    "<S> the measured intensity was fitted by the following expression : @xmath14 , where i@xmath15 is the initial radiation intensity , @xmath16 is the cumulative factor determined by the absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the formula takes also into account the change of the acceptance vs the angle @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence is shown by the curve 3 in fig . 3 , and it has a maximum at 82@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated angular dependence for x - ray fluorescence has good agreement with the measured one for the disordered nanotube film and shows absence of peculiarities in the range of angles close to the normal .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 presents also the angular distribution of x - ray fluorescence from the si substrate ( curve 4 ) . due to the presence of a sio@xmath17 layer on the substrate surface </S>",
    "<S> , a fluorescence spectrum is formed by the o k@xmath0 , si k@xmath0 , si k@xmath18 and si l@xmath19 lines . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , the angular dependences for the substrate and nanotube film are rather similar , while in the case of clean substrate the integral intensity is 5 times less . </S>",
    "<S> the reason of low intensity can be due to comparative low probability for si ionization ( @xmath20 = 1.8 kev ) by the bremsstrahlung of x - ray tube . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , leads to low intensity of the both si k@xmath0 and k@xmath18 lines . </S>",
    "<S> contribution of x - ray emission by oxygen could be comparable with the c k@xmath0 spectra of cns , however , its quantity is small . </S>",
    "<S> the si l@xmath19 lines signal detected by the gas proportional counter is very weak because of relatively large thickness of the counter window . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in fluorescence emission from the substrate ( curve 4 ) with respect to the x - ray emission in presence of the cn film ( curves 1 and 2 ) at scattering angles less than 70@xmath6 is due to the change in the absorption coefficients for si and c. thus , even the substrate fluorescence contributes in the forming of the curves 1 and 2 , its relative value is rather small , and we can neglect it .    a five - time enlarged difference between the curves 1 and 2 is given by the curve 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the integral presented by the curve 5 was estimated to be @xmath8 0.4 % of the total fluorescence intensity . despite the large statistical spread </S>",
    "<S> , this dependence obviously exhibits a maximum of @xmath8 6@xmath6 in width at 90@xmath6 that based on `` a plato '' of @xmath8 20@xmath6 in width . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that this feature is caused by the influence of cns alignment on x - ray fluorescence , and the maximum width is mainly defined by the deviation of cns from a vertical alignment . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray fluorescence from strongly bent cns that takes place near the film surface , gives a broad diffuse halo . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution 5 is determined by the combination of various mechanisms of radiation scattering in the nanotube film . </S>",
    "<S> we shall try to evaluate contribution by the main scattering factors in the total angular distribution of radiation behind the studied structures .    </S>",
    "<S> mean angular deviation @xmath21 of x - ray fluorescence after traversing a cn film can be estimated , paying attention to the fact that , originally , x - ray fluorescence is isotropic . obviously , the width is defined by coherent and incoherent radiation scattering in the inner cavity and the walls of nanotubes ( the latter can be considered as radiation diffraction on a multilayer system ) @xmath22 , as well as by diffuse scattering in the space between separate nanotubes and incoherent scattering by the structure imperfections @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 . in turn , the diffuse term depends on the texture of nanotube layer and on the mean distance between the separate nanotubes or the bundles of nanotubes tightly attached to each other , i.e. @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> incoherent scattering due to the film texture @xmath26 is determined by radiation absorption in the tube walls and by imperfections , while the second term @xmath27 , which corresponds to the free fly - by ( straight ray ) propagation , can be easily evaluated from the geometrical structure parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> detailed examination of microscopic pictures of the samples allows the texture parameters to be defined . </S>",
    "<S> namely , our analysis shows that for a film thickness @xmath28 10 @xmath7 m , the mean distance between the separate nanotubes or the bundles of nanotubes is about @xmath29 100 nm . more than that , mean angular deviation in the angular orientation for the nanotubes layer is in the range of 30@xmath6 @xmath9 50@xmath6 that defines @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> for the studied samples the term @xmath31 @xmath32 , corresponding to the straight ray propagation between the nanotube bundles , does not exceed a few mrads ( @xmath33 1@xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , so called collimation effect , strongly depends on the depth of radiation source position ; due to the low density of the film , any nanotube atom can be a source of x - ray fluorescence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as well known , the c k@xmath34-spectrum has an energy extended structure in the range of 275 - 284 ev close to the k - edge ( @xmath35 285 ev ) , and the coefficient of absorption is rather low for the photons near the absorption edge he ... adndt82 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the effect of collimation will be suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can conclude that diffusive part of radiation scattering in the nanotube film forms a wide background in the angular distribution of x - ray fluorescence .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us evaluate @xmath22 that we defined as a term describing radiation scattering inside aligned channels ( nanotubes ) . </S>",
    "<S> in this case the problem becomes similar to the electromagnetic wave propagation in optical fibers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following a general definition of scattering at channeling ( see @xcite ) , mean - square angle of radiation scattering in a nanotube can be estimated by : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the internal radius of empty cylindrical nanotube core , @xmath38 and @xmath39 correspond to the emitted photon energy and the number of photons with energy @xmath38 , @xmath40 is the electron density and @xmath41 is the radial coordinate in the transverse nanotube cross - section ded - nimb98,zhgl - pla98 . reducing this expression results in @xmath42 at the given values of @xmath43@xmath8 100 - 170 ev and @xmath37@xmath8 2 - 3 nm . </S>",
    "<S> however , this estimation is valid just for the proper channeling regime ( an ideal case ) , when the effects of dechanneling ( when x - ray beams leave nanotube channels ) are suppressed . in the considered case we deal with multiwall bent nanotubes . and first </S>",
    "<S> , it is necessary to take into account dechanneling of photons due to the strong nanotube bending , at which the requirements for x - ray channeling are violated . indeed , essential bending through the short distances causes increasing the angles of radiation propagation with respect to the nanotube longitudinal axis , that results in fast dechanneling of x rays . </S>",
    "<S> thus , x - ray channeling takes place just in the rather straight parts of nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> however , these parts are governed by the film texture . due to that , the angular distribution formed by x rays at channeling could be wide . </S>",
    "<S> herewith , studying the sem images by the fourier analysis has shown that on the base of resolvable nanotube disorientation , one can observe a sharp narrow ( 5@xmath4410@xmath6 ) peak for nanotubes normally directed kin ... conf03 .    </S>",
    "<S> what deserves special mention is the tunneling through the potential barrier that in our case is responsible for the radiation leakage through the nanotube wall . in our samples , the thickness of walls @xmath45 varied in the limits of @xmath46@xmath8 3 @xmath9 7 nm , which is of the order of the transverse wavelength of radiation @xmath47 4.42 nm </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the probability of tunneling , @xmath48 , is quite high . </S>",
    "<S> that s probably why relative integrated power of the narrow peak in the angular distribution of emerged radiation is very weak . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the tunneling process is accompanied by a small - angle diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> presence of a set of equidistant layers in the wall leads to the diffraction dispersion of x - ray photons in such a manner that the first diffraction maximum is practically observed at angles close to the scattering angles under channeling ( @xmath8 @xmath49 ) .    in our work we studied orientational effects of x - radiation scattering in a layer of nanotubes . during measurements of x - ray fluorescence from a film of aligned multiwall cns </S>",
    "<S> , the intensity amplification was revealed at angles close to the normal . </S>",
    "<S> the width of a reflection curve is mainly defined by the angular deviation in orientation of nanotubes .    </S>",
    "<S> recent development of the technology of nanostructure manufacturing testifies more and more to the opportunity for cultivation of layers of aligned nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the question on the use of hollow nanostructure channels becomes rather actual . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious , that the quality of film arrangement is still far from perfect in order to consider these structures as objects with the stable allocated directions . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the discussed effects can be observed on micron distances due to extremely small channel sizes , already today , it is possible to start studying structural effects of radiation scattering in cns .    </S>",
