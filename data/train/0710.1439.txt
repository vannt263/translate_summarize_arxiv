    "a possible way to avoid the inconsistence of geometric brownian motion as a model of speculative markets is the assumption that the volatility is itself a time - depending random variable . within this assumption there",

    "it is empirically established that the autocorrelation function of volatility decays very slowly with time exhibiting two different exponents of the power - law distribution : for short time scales and for the long time ones . however , common stochastic volatility models are able reproduce only one time scale exponential decay @xcite .",

    "empirical analysis confirms that the long - range correlations in volatility arise due to those of the trading activity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the trading activity can be modeled as the event flow of the stochastic point process with more evident microscopic interpretation of the observed power - law statistics .    recently , we proposed the stochastic model of the trading activity in the financial markets as poissonian - like process driven by the stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xcite . here",
