    "one of the most direct manifestations of closed quark loop effects is in the mass of the flavor singlet pseudoscalar @xmath3 meson .",
    "the @xmath3 propagator includes not only the valence quark - antiquark term that appears in the nonsinglet propagator , but also the contribution from diagrams in which the valence quark and antiquark annihilate .",
    "these `` hairpin '' diagrams probe the topological structure of the gauge field via the axial @xmath4 anomaly . in a large @xmath5 approximation ,",
    "the axial anomaly may be introduced perturbatively as a term which breaks the @xmath6 symmetry of the massless quark lagrangian . from the chiral lagrangian point of view",
    ", the anomaly adds a term @xmath7 to the @xmath8 lagrangian @xmath9 which gives the @xmath3 its mass . for low momentum , and keeping only terms quadratic in the @xmath3 field , the most general form of such a term is ( c.f .",

    "the constant @xmath12 is a renormalization of the @xmath3 field induced by the inclusion of the anomaly . in the large @xmath5 framework , the term ( [ eq : l1 ] )",
    "may be identified with the quenched hairpin diagram .",
    "it corresponds to an amputated hairpin vertex of the form @xmath13 the main difference between quenched and full qcd is that in quenched qcd , the hairpin vertex appears only once in the @xmath3 propagator , while in full qcd it appears an arbitrary number of times . in the latter case ,",
    "the hairpin insertions sum up geometrically and shift the @xmath14 goldstone pole to a pole at @xmath15 .",
    "by contrast , the _ quenched _",
    "@xmath3 propagator includes only a single hairpin insertion .",
    "not only is the goldstone pole not cancelled , but the hairpin graph adds a double pole @xmath16 term to the propagator .",
    "note that , by ( [ eq : hairvertex ] ) , the quenched diagram with a single hairpin insertion includes both a single pole and a double pole term , with coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the appearance of a double pole in the quenched @xmath3 propagator gives rise to anomalous chiral behavior , e.g. in the relation between the pion mass and the quark mass@xcite .",
    "the chiral symmetry result that @xmath19 is linear in the quark mass is replaced in the quenched approximation by @xmath20 where the parameter @xmath21 which determines the anomalous power behavior is the coefficient of the quenched chiral log in the one - loop graph , and is proportional to @xmath18 , the value of the hairpin insertion at @xmath22 .",
    "this gives @xmath23 if we assume that @xmath24 , a rough estimate using @xmath25 gev gives @xmath26",
    "it has recently been argued @xcite that the behavior of the pion mass as a function of the bare quark mass calculated in quenched lattice qcd shows little or no evidence for the presence of chiral logs at the level suggested by the estimate ( [ eq : naive ] ) .",
    "we have analyzed the quenched pion mass from acpmaps data at four different @xmath27 values and a variety of hopping parameters , as shown in table 1 .",
    "the pion masses were extracted from the pseudoscalar propagator with pointlike sources . to determine and remove the effect of excited states , both one- and two - exponential fits for a variety of time windows were carried out .",
    "for some of the @xmath28 values at @xmath29 , the pion mass obtained in this way was compared with that obtained using smeared - source quark propagators , and the results were found to agree within statistical errors . for each @xmath27 value , the pion masses for @xmath30 values of @xmath28 were calculated ( here @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) , with the full @xmath33 error matrix being computed by a jackknife elimination . by minimizing the covariant @xmath34 ,",
    "a 3-parameter fit was obtained to the fitting function @xmath35 with fit parameters @xmath36 and @xmath21 .",
    "the results for the parameter @xmath21 are given in table 1 .",
    "for all four values of @xmath27 , the value obtained for @xmath21 is consistent with zero . combining the statistics of the four @xmath27 s , we get @xmath37 in the analysis leading to ( [ eq : limit ] ) , only values of @xmath28 corresponding to pion masses of less than 750 mev",
    "were included in the fits in an effort to minimize the effect of higher order chiral perturbation theory terms . in the @xmath29 result ( where there were four mass points and hence one degree of freedom in the fit ) , the covariant @xmath34 was 0.1 , indicating that a good fit is obtained without the need for higher order terms in ( [ eq : fit ] ) .",

    "to investigate the apparent suppression of chiral logs further , we calculated the hairpin diagram directly at @xmath39 , using the technique of kuramashi , et al @xcite .",
    "the calculations were carried out on both @xmath40 and @xmath41 lattices .",
    "our main conclusion is that _ the value of @xmath18 extracted from a direct calculation of the hairpin graph is much smaller than the physical @xmath3 mass - squared , and consistent with the small value of @xmath21 inferred from the limits on quenched chiral logs in the pion mass_. at the @xmath28 values and lattice sizes for which a direct comparison could be made , our raw data was in good agreement with that of ref .",
    "our somewhat different conclusion regarding the suppression of the hairpin vertex at small @xmath0 follows from several factors which we briefly mention here .",
    "first , in order to extract the coefficient of the double pole term in the hairpin ( i.e. @xmath18 ) , the pion propagators on either side of the vertex were assumed to contain excited - state as well as ground - state contributions , with the excited state mass determined from the previously described pion propagator analysis .",
    "( the coefficient of the excited state term was a free parameter in the fit . )",
    "it is important to note that , in the hairpin diagram , terms involving an excited state on one but not both sides of the hairpin still contain a single goldstone pole , and thus fall off with the same exponential factor as the ground state term .",
    "they are only suppressed by a power of @xmath42 , i.e. they fall off like @xmath43 instead of @xmath44 . for our fits ,",
    "the inclusion of excited state contributions to the hairpin propagator reduced the extracted value of @xmath18 by about 30 to 50% compared to a pure ground state fit .",
    "secondly , a comparison of our results for @xmath40 and @xmath41 lattices with the same @xmath27 and @xmath28 values exhibits a large and highly mass dependent finite volume effect on the measured value of @xmath18 .",
    "this raises doubt about the results of performing a chiral extrapolation on a fixed size box .",
    "( the chiral extrapolation contributed substantially to the quoted value of @xmath45 mev in ref .",
    "the results of the hairpin calculation for several @xmath28 s and two box sizes are converted to an effective value of @xmath21 and plotted in fig .",
    "they are seen to be consistent with the one - standard - deviation upper bound from the pion mass analysis .",
    "( the dotted line represents the upper bound from the @xmath39 pion mass data in table i. )    for the range of quark masses considered , the results presented here provide strong evidence that the size of quenched chiral logs is suppressed by the fact that the hairpin vertex evaluated on the pion mass shell is much smaller than expected from the assumptions that @xmath46 and @xmath24 . if we discard the possibility that @xmath47 ( which would be a disturbing failure of qcd to reproduce the real world ) , it may be concluded that @xmath48 and that the hairpin is highly momentum dependent .",
    "in addition to analyzing the time - dependence of the hairpin propagator , there is an indirect way to determine @xmath49 independently of @xmath12 by appealing to the witten - veneziano formula , which relates @xmath49 to @xmath50 , the topological susceptibility of pure glue , @xmath51 it turns out that the same data generated in the hairpin calculation can also be used to obtain an approximate measurement of the winding number of each gauge configuration in an ensemble , using the anomalous chiral ward identity , @xmath52 by studying the behavior of a single @xmath53 loop integrated over the entire lattice as a function of quark mass , ( [ eq : ward ] ) may be used to obtain an approximate determination of the winding numbers of the configurations .",
    "( a more detailed discussion of this method and its applications will be presented elsewhere . ) from the same @xmath53 loops used to compute the hairpin at @xmath29 and @xmath54 , we obtain a mean squared winding number of @xmath55 .",
    "the error here is a very rough estimate based on varying the criteria for observing a @xmath56 pole . from this , and using @xmath57 gev , we obtain the topological susceptibility @xmath58 and from the formula ( [ eq : wv ] ) , @xmath59 gev .",
