    "the importance of a node or link is manifest only after its _",
    "failure_. this motivates us to consider the rate of the exponential loss from a network in which a node fails ( escape rate ) as a measure of the _ failure - centrality _ of this node .",
    "the traditional analysis of trapping problems is based on the first passage time to the considered node  @xcite .",
    "a quantity closely related to the escape rate considered here is the global mean first - passage time , and a typical problem is how this quantity scales with network size ( see e.g. refs .",
    "mean - field models allow for an estimation of the mean first passage time ( and also the escape rate ) for nodes of a given degree ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "a point that seems to have not been explored in detail so far is that nodes with the same degree may show very different behavior , i.e. , our failure - centrality differs from the degree of the node .",
    "an example of this variability is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : switching ] . nodes leading to a faster decay of the number of surviving walkers are the most important one , either because they lead to the strongest leakage of the network or because they provide the fastest target for random - walkers .",
    "the situation sketched above , equivalent to an absorbing markov chain , has a parallel in the problem of placing holes in the phase space of chaotic dynamical systems , as previously noticed and explored in refs .  @xcite . in that context",
    ", the dependence of the asymptotic escape rate on the size and position of the hole has been a topic of much recent interest  @xcite .",
    "one insightful question is  @xcite : where to place a hole to achieve a maximal escape rate ? in the network context , this corresponds to asking  @xcite : which is the best node to place the target on so that it is faster / slower for a random walker to find it ? some analogies between open dynamical systems and networks has been used also in applications of isospectral transformations that reduce the complexity of networks  @xcite and in analyses of the connectivity of the network  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the network properties responsible for the variety in the escape rate obtained when nodes fail .",
    "we adapt previously known results to the network problem ( as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) and we then extend them to temporal - varying failures .",
    "in particular , we show how the escape rate obtained when one node fails can be approximated based on the short loops passing through this node , one element which can often be neglected in random networks but which is present in virtually all real world examples  @xcite .",
    "we dwell on the possibility of externally changing the relative importance of nodes in a given network , by exploiting the interference between the loops traversing the nodes and externally - imposed failures .",
    "finally , we test our results in two real - world networks ( air transportation and e - mail ) and show how community structures influence our estimations .",
    "the process we study is a random walk on the network defined by an @xmath3 irreducible and aperiodic stochastic matrix @xmath4 : its entries @xmath5 are the probability for a random walker to jump from node @xmath6 to node @xmath7 at every ( discrete ) time step .",
    "starting from a weighted , fully - connected , directed network with @xmath8 nodes  defined by the @xmath3 connectivity matrix @xmath9 with real - valued entries @xmath10  @xmath4 may be constructed considering @xmath11 to be proportional to the probability to follow the outgoing link ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we call the dynamics in @xmath4 the _ closed _ dynamics",
    ". we can _ open _ it by letting a node _ fail _ : the failure of a node @xmath6 is modeled by modifying its outgoing links @xmath13 - eventually as a function of time - in such a way that @xmath14 .",
    "this corresponds to the physical intuition that a walker on the failed node has a non - zero probability to be lost from the network .    in a network with a failed node @xmath6 , the probability @xmath15 that a random walker is not lost up to time",
    "@xmath16 asymptically decays exponentially with a rate @xmath17 we interpret the escape rate @xmath18 as the _ failure - centrality _ of the node @xmath6 , i.e. , a measure capturing the sensitivity of the network to its failure .",
    "consider first the case of total failure of a node @xmath6 , corresponding to the case where all its outgoing links have zero weight ( equivalent to certain loss of the random walker once on the node ) ; and denote by @xmath19 the corresponding matrix .",
    "it is well known that @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the largest eigenvalue of the matrix .",
    "note that , according to the perron - frobenius theorem , @xmath22 corresponding to no loss of walkers moving randomly through the network . generically @xmath18 is a non trivial function of the node , even for very simple , regular networks such as that displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : switching]a . in applications , it is important to determine which node is more relevant ( in the above sense ) for a given network , and more generally their ranking in relative importance . in principle",

    "( [ eq : escape - rate - eigenvalue ] ) for @xmath23 nodes . in practice , for large @xmath8 this requires a prohibitive computational effort ( see  @xcite for an analytic approach that works in some particular cases ) .",
    "furthermore , such brute - force computation brings no insight on the properties of the closed network @xmath4 responsible for the importance of a node .",
    "here we show how the values and ordering of @xmath18 can be efficiently estimated based on the degree and short loops of node  @xmath6 in @xmath4 .",
    "as a first approximation we can imagine that , if the network is complex enough , at each time step it looses a fraction of walkers corresponding to the equilibrium measure  @xmath24 of the closed network on the failed node  @xmath6 , so that asymptotically in time @xmath25 and thus for a large network ( @xmath26 ) we obtain as the zero - th order approximation @xmath27 in networks with fixed degree ( @xmath7-regular networks ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq.gamma0 ] ) predicts the same @xmath1 for all nodes  @xmath6 , as does eigenvector centrality and pagerank of the closed network  @xcite . in chaotic systems ,",
    "equivalent approximations have been shown to provide only a rough estimate of @xmath18 which , even in the case of uniform stationary distribution , show interesting fluctuations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for references and an historical overview , and refs .",
    "@xcite , for recent rigorous connections between the fluctuations and _ periodic orbits _ ) . adapting these results to the problem of random - walk in complex networks",

    "an example of the approximation  ( [ eq : gamma - first - order - form ] ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : switching]a together with the zero- and first - order approximations .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the case of temporal dependent failures . in chaotic dynamical systems , holes having a deterministic  @xcite and stochastic  @xcite variation in the _ position",
    "_ have been considered . here",
    "we fix the failing node and consider a ( stochastic and deterministic ) temporal variation in its state ( failing or not ) .",
    "consider the situation in which a given temporal fixed protocol of failures , defined by a periodic binary sequence @xmath32^{\\infty}$ ] is externally imposed on a given node @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , at each time @xmath33 a random walker on the network moves in the closed network @xmath4 if @xmath34 or in the open @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "in such a situation , the probability for the walker not to be lost after @xmath16 iterations decays exponentially with a rate @xmath35 derived from the corresponding product of the matrices @xmath36 where , to lighten notation , we avoid explicitly expressing the dependence on the node and simply denote @xmath37 the open network .",
    "we now derive approximations of eq .",

    "on the other hand , a new observation in the air - transportation network is the existence of sets of nodes which deviate substantially from the approximations ( the outliers in fig .",
    "[ fig : airports1 ] ) : the airports from @xmath143 to @xmath144 ( hubs ) and the set @xmath145 of five airports @xmath146 .",
    "next we explain these deviations and their relation with the existence of communities in the network , i.e. , nodes that are strongly connected to each other and only weakly connected to other nodes@xcite . in the air transportation network the nodes @xmath145 are the most interconnected ones , having a single weak connection ( through node @xmath147 ) to the rest of the network ( a bottleneck ) . the escape rate from @xmath145 to the outside",
    "is @xmath148 ( obtained , e.g. , if we start in @xmath145 and consider the node @xmath147 to fail ) .",
    "if a node outside @xmath145 fails , two cases have to be considered . for nodes with small degree , the escape rate from the large portion of the network is @xmath149 and therefore it dominates the global escape rate and agrees with the approximations . for nodes with high degree ,",
    "the escape from the large portion of the network is fast , @xmath150 , and hence the global rate becomes @xmath151 because asymptotically the smallest escape rate dominates .",
    "this explains the appearance of the plateau in the hubs of fig .",
    "[ fig : airports1 ] at @xmath152 . in this case",
    "the approximations @xmath63 and @xmath28 describe closely the escape rate obtained from the _ second _ largest eigenvalue of the network whose eigenvector is localized outside @xmath145 ( the eigenvector associated to @xmath153 is always localized in @xmath145 ) . finally ,",
    "if a node in @xmath145 fails , the escape rate is dominated by the small probability to jump from the large network through the bottleneck ( in node @xmath147 ) to @xmath145 , explaining the appearance of the same small @xmath1 for all these nodes ( bottom crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : airports1]ab ) .    in order to understand further the effect that the topology of these real - world networks has , we repeat our analysis in link randomised versions of the airport and e - mail networks . in both cases",
    "we obtain that the escape rate is very well approximated by the zeroth order approximation  ( [ eq.gamma0 ] ) ( speraman s rank correlation of @xmath154 in the randomized airport network and @xmath155 in the e - mail network ) .",
    "this happens because the randomization destroys communities and short loops in the network , the sources of deviations from the zero - order approximation discussed above .",
    "short loops are ubiquitous in real - world networks , in which improved results are obtained by our approximation  ( [ eq : gamma_ap ] ) .",
    "in summary , we have shown how to efficiently estimate the escape rate of random walkers in networks in which specific nodes fail .",
    "our new formula  ( [ eq : gamma_ap ] ) outperforms estimations based on the degree or equilibrium measures , shows the importance of the degree and of short loops passing through the failing nodes , and applies also to temporal dependent failures ( stochastic or through a fixed protocol ) .",
    "the approximation is valid for small perturbations ( i.e. , degree of the failing node much smaller than network size ) . in this limit ,",
    "our results are expected to hold also in cases in which multiple nodes and edges fail .",
    "the escape rate can be viewed as a measure of node importance that quantifies how sensitive the network is to failures in this node ( _ failure - centrality _ ) .",
    "the results summarized above allow for an estimation of this measure , which differs from the degree and other centrality measures .",
    "for instance , the eigenvector and page - rank centrality coincide with the zero - th order approximation of the failure centrality , eq.([eq.gamma0 ] ) , and are therefore different from the failure centrality already in this simple case . in networks with general degree distributions",
    "these measures differ even more significantly from the failure centrality , e.g. , in the scale - free networks discussed in table [ table : appacc ] we found a spearman s rank correlation of 0.735 ( to page rank ) and 0.748 ( to eigenvector centrality ) .",
    "the failure - centrality measure depends also on the type of temporal failure the nodes experience .",
    "we have shown how switches in the importance of nodes appear and can be engineered depending on the interplay between the period of the temporal failure and the length of the loops present in the network .    in real - world networks ,",
    "the appearance of communities enhance the deviations between the escape rate and naive estimations . at the same time ,",
    "when hubs fail the escape of random walks from the closest communities may dominate the global escape rate and lead to deviations from our theory .",
    "the introduction of failures in nodes can thus be used to quickly detect the strongest communities of a network , in the same way that holes have been introduced in chaotic dynamical systems to visualize their underlying invariant manifolds  @xcite .",
