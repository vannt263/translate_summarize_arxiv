    "let us describe the periodic homogenization theory of hamilton - jacobi equations . for each @xmath1 ,",

    "the initial data @xmath9 , the set of bounded , uniformly continuous functions on @xmath10 .",
    "it was proven by lions , papanicolaou and varadhan @xcite that @xmath11 converges to @xmath12 locally uniformly on @xmath13 as @xmath14 , and @xmath12 solves the effective equation @xmath15 the effective hamiltonian @xmath16 is determined in a nonlinear way by @xmath17 and @xmath18 through the cell problems as following . for each @xmath19 , it was shown in @xcite that there exists a unique constant @xmath20 such that the following cell problem has a continuous viscosity solution @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the @xmath23-dimensional flat torus @xmath24 .",
    "although there is a vast literature on homogenization of hamilton - jacobi equations in different settings after @xcite , characterizing the shape of @xmath25 remains largely open even in basic situations .",
    "let us summarize quickly what is known in the literature about @xmath0 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath0 is coercive thanks to the coercivity of @xmath17 .",
    "if one assumes furthermore that @xmath17 is convex , then @xmath0 is also convex and the graph of @xmath0 can contain some flat parts ( i.e. , @xmath26 has interior points ) .",
    "see @xcite and the works of concordel @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this convex setting , we have the following representation formula , thanks to the results of contreras , iturriaga , paternain and paternain @xcite , and gomes @xcite , @xmath27 note that the above representative formula still holds if @xmath17 is quasiconvex ( level - set convex ) , in which case @xmath0 is also quasiconvex .",
    "more interestingly , in case @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , a deep result of bangert @xcite says that the level curve @xmath31 for every @xmath32 must contain line segments ( i.e. , not strictly convex ) unless @xmath18 is a constant function .",
    "bangert s result relies on detailed information about the structure of aubry - mather sets in two dimension ( @xcite ) .",
    "see also jing , tran , yu @xcite for discussion regarding locations of line segments of the level curves for ma type hamiltonians .",
    "the first numerical computation of effective hamiltonians is due to qian @xcite based on the so called _ big - t method _ , that is , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the unique viscosity solution to @xmath35 for other numerical schemes , we refer to gomes , oberman @xcite , falcone , rorro @xcite , achdou , camilli , capuzzo - dolcetta @xcite , oberman , takei , vladimirsky @xcite , luo , yu , zhao @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it is worth mentioning that cell problem and representation formula appear also in weak kam theory ( see e @xcite , evans , gomes @xcite , fathi @xcite for the convex case , and cagnetti , gomes , tran @xcite for the nonconvex case ) .",
    "in fact , a central goal of the weak kam theory is to find information of underlying dynamical system encoded in the effective hamiltonian .    in the case where @xmath17 is nonconvex , to identify the shape of @xmath0 is highly nontrivial even in the one dimensional space .",
    "this was settled only very recently by armstrong , tran , yu @xcite , and gao @xcite .",
    "one fundamental feature obtained is the  _ quasi - convexification _ \" phenomenon , that is , the effective hamiltonian @xmath25 becomes quasiconvex ( level - set convex ) when the oscillation of @xmath18 is large enough .",
    "see section [ sec : quasi ] for more precise statements . in multi - dimensional spaces ,",
    "armstrong , tran , yu @xcite obtained a qualitative shape of @xmath0 for a representative case where @xmath36 .",
    "other than @xcite , very little is known about finer properties of nonconvex @xmath0 in multi - dimensional spaces , partly due to the extreme complexity of dynamics associated with nonconvex hamiltonians .",
    "furthermore , as far as the authors know , there is no numerical study of @xmath0 in this case .",
    "let us also call attention to an extrinsic way to study @xmath0 via inverse problems .",
    "see luo , tran , yu @xcite .      reducing a complex quantity to relatively simpler objects is a very natural and common idea in mathematics . for a class of nonconvex hamiltonians @xmath17",
    ", we introduce a new decomposition method to obtain min - max type representation formulas for @xmath0 .",
    "these formulas consist of effective hamiltonians of quasiconvex hamiltonians which are presumably less challenging to analyze .",
    "the most general statement is given by inductive formulas ( theorem [ maintheorem ] ) .",
    "two specific ( but important ) cases of theorem [ maintheorem ] are provided in theorem [ thm : rep1 ] and lemma [ thm : rep2 ] .",
    "one immediate corollary is the evenness of @xmath25 associated with a certain class of radially symmetric hamiltonians , which is otherwise not obvious at all . given the vast variety of nonconvex functions , our surgical approach is only a preliminary step toward understanding the shape of nonconvex @xmath25 . in section 2.4 , we present some natural obstacles to decomposing a nonconvex @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , there is a connection between  non - decomposability \" and loss of evenness .    as another interesting application , the method and",
    "the representation formulas are robust enough that we are also able to prove stochastic homogenization for the same class of nonconvex @xmath17 in the appendix .",
    "for instance , theorem [ thm : random ] includes the result in @xcite as a special case with a much shorter proof .",
    "the detailed discussion on this ( including a brief overview of stochastic homogenization ) is left to the appendix .",
    "we would like to point out that a priori identification of shape of @xmath25 is currently the only available way to tackle homogenization of nonconvex hamilton - jacobi equations in general stationary ergodic setting .    in section 3 ,",
    "we provide various numerical computations of @xmath0 in multi - dimensional spaces for general radially symmetric hamiltonians and a double - well type hamiltonian .",
    "these provide insights on how the changes of potential energy @xmath18 affect the changes in shape of effective hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "the important  quasi - convexification \" phenomenon is observed in multi - dimensional cases as well .",
    "nevertheless , verifying it rigorously seems to be quite challenging .",
    "interesting connections between decomposition , loss of evenness and quasi - convexification are demonstrated in section 2.4 and remark [ rem : conj ] .",
    "several open problems are provided based on the numerical evidences we have in this section .",
    "the setting is this . let @xmath37 be a continuous , coercive hamiltonian such that    * @xmath38 and there exists a bounded domain @xmath39 such that @xmath40 * @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .",
