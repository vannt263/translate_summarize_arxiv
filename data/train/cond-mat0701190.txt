    "_ the zero - range process _ ( zrp ) is a stochastic model in which many indistinguishable particles occupy sites on a lattice @xcite .",
    "each site of the lattice may contain an integer number of particles and the particles hop to the next site with a probability which depends on the number of particles at the departure site .",
    "in other words , each particle interacts with the particles at the same site , i.e. , they have a zero - range interaction .",
    "the hop probability is totally asymmetric , i.e. , particles can only move in the definite direction and hence the flow of particles , even from the macroscopic viewpoint , never vanishes in general .",
    "the flow gives rise to a contrasting density distribution of particles , and one may therefore regard the zrp as a typical nonequilibrium system @xcite . since one can choose any function as the hop probability function , the zrp has been extensively studied and applied for a wide variety of many - particle systems @xcite .",
    "although there now exist a lot of generalized / extended versions of the zrp @xcite , in this paper we focus exclusively on the original one , i.e. , the zrp in one dimension and with periodic boundary . updates of the particle configuration occur at each discrete time step , and two typical update rules , the parallel and random sequential update rules , are considered .",
    "these rules are defined as follows .",
    "_ parallel update rule _ : at each time step , simultaneously at every site , one particle attempts to hop to the next site with its hop probability .",
    "_ random sequential update rule _ : at each time step , a site is selected at random and then one particle at the site attempts to hop to the next site with its hop probability .",
    "it is notable that the zrp in one dimension can be mapped onto an exclusion process , i.e. , a many - particle system on a periodic lattice whose sites contain a single particle or none @xcite .",
    "hereafter we call particles in the exclusion process _",
    "vehicle _ to prevent confusion .",
    "according to this mapping , particles in the zrp are regarded as the distance between adjacent vehicles in the exclusion process , i.e. , the number of particles at site @xmath0 indicates the number of blank sites in front of vehicle @xmath0 following vehicle @xmath1 ; accordingly , for a particle to hop to the next site in the zrp is for a vehicle to hop to the next site in the exclusion process .",
    "this exclusion process adequately simulates a traffic flow in which vehicles hop forward each with its own probability depending on the distance to the front vehicle .",
    "note that the number of sites in the exclusion process is equal to the sum of sites and particles in the zrp and meanwhile the number of vehicles is equal to that of sites in the zrp .",
    "in this section , following @xcite , we precisely define the nonequilibrium steady state of the zrp and then formulate the partition function in that steady state . as well as equilibrium statistical mechanics , expectation values of physical quantities should be given by using that partition function .",
    "let @xmath2 be the probability of finding the system in a configuration @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the number of particles at the @xmath5th site .",
    "the transition probability from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , denoted by @xmath8 , is expressed by the hop probability function @xmath9 respectively according to the update rule , i.e. , parallel and random sequential update rules .",
    "note that it is always true that @xmath10 .",
    "we firstly consider the parallel update rule .",
    "the transition probability for the update rule is given by @xmath11,\\ ] ] where , at each site , @xmath12 particle hops to the next site with probability @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the kronecker delta that returns unity if @xmath15 and zero otherwise .",
    "the balance of probability currents at each configuration @xmath7 is represented by the following equation : @xmath16=0.\\label{sscp}\\ ] ] then , we call a solution of ( [ sscp ] ) _ the nonequilibrium steady state probability _ ( or the steady state probability , simply ) .",
    "the steady state probability @xmath2 is given as a product of the single - site weights @xmath17 : @xmath18 where a normalization @xmath19 , the sum of the products over all configurations , is referred to as _ the partition function _ for the zrp in the nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "one can directly confirm that ( [ p ] ) is a solution of ( [ sscp ] ) ; meanwhile the single - site weight is found to be @xmath20 next , we consider the random sequential update rule . in this case , one can describe the steady state condition in a simple form : @xmath21\\theta(n_m),\\label{sscr}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the heaviside function , which emphasizes that site @xmath5 must be occupied for there to be associated hops out of and into the configuration @xmath7 . as well as in the case of the parallel update rule , the steady state probability @xmath2 is given in the product form ( [ p ] ) , where the single - site weight for the random sequential update rule is @xmath23 ( see @xcite and @xcite for details . )      it should be noted that @xmath17 is not identical to the probability that a given site ( e.g. site 1 ) contains @xmath24 particles .",
    "let the probability denoted by @xmath25 , and it is obtained from the probability distribution of configurations @xmath2 as @xmath26 the sum of @xmath25 over @xmath24 is unity by definition , and we thereby obtain the recursion formula for the partition functions : @xmath27 considering the generating functions , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we have a recursion with respect only to @xmath30 : @xmath31 .",
    "consequently , we find the fundamental relation between the two generating functions : @xmath32 thus , the partition function @xmath19 is obtained from the single - site weight @xmath17 via their generating functions . from the statistical mechanical viewpoint",
    ", @xmath33 is appropriate for us to call _ the grand - canonical partition function _",
    ", where we should think of @xmath34 as the fugacity @xcite . using @xmath25 given in ( [ p ] ) , the average velocity of vehicles in the steady state is defined by @xmath35 in the case of parallel update rule , we find that the average velocity is expressed by the partition function as @xmath36 in the case of random sequential update rule , we also find @xmath37 ( see @xcite for details . )",
    "in this section , we exactly compute the partition function and then the expectation value of the average velocity . these computations are fully done by using the formulae for the lauricella hypergeometric function .",
    "the definition and formulae used are relegated to appendix .",
    "we start with the hop probability function @xmath9 given as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant integer .",
    "this is not a strong restriction , for one may take @xmath40 to be as large as necessary . as far as traffic - flow models are concerned ,",
    "it is quite natural to choose this kind of hop probability function .    substitution of ( [ up ] ) into ( [ fp ] ) yields @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and we accordingly transform @xmath43 into a convenient form , i.e. , @xmath44,\\label{gfp}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath45 if @xmath15 .",
    "for further computations , we formally factor the most right hand side of ( [ gfp ] ) : @xmath46 then , comparing ( [ gfp ] ) with ( [ fxp ] ) , we note the relation between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , namely @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the @xmath24th elementary symmetric function of @xmath40 variables , @xmath51 .",
    "( note that the elementary symmetric functions are defined by its generating function : @xmath52 , and specially @xmath53 . )    accordingly , substitution of ( [ fxp ] ) into ( [ genzgenf ] ) yields @xmath54 compare ( [ genzgenf2 ] ) with ( [ genl ] ) , the generating function for the lauricella hypergeometric function @xmath55 , and one finds an expression for the partition function in the nonequilibrium steady state : if @xmath56 then @xmath57 and otherwise @xmath58 .",
    "( see [ app ] for definition of the notation . ) as seen below , this expression using the lauricella hypergeometric function is quite useful for exact computation of expectation values . in the case that @xmath59",
    "the average velocity in the steady state takes the value of unity , since all vehicles take more than @xmath40-site distance from the front vehicle ( or all sites in the corresponding zrp contain more than @xmath40 particles ) .",
    "if @xmath56 , by substituting of ( [ zp ] ) into ( [ vp ] ) we have an expression for the average velocity . using a recursion formula for the lauricella hypergeometric function with respect to parameters ( [ lrec ] ) ,",
    "@xmath60 the sum in the numerator in ( [ vp ] ) is firstly carried out : @xmath61 accordingly , the average velocity of vehicles for arbitrary numbers of sites and vehicles is given as @xmath62 we remark that ( [ vpl ] ) is valid for arbitrary numbers of @xmath30 and @xmath63 .",
    "then , we expand ( [ vpl ] ) in lattice size @xmath64 with a fixed density of vehicles @xmath65 . our strategy to take",
    "the thermodynamic limit is to eliminate the hypergeometric function from ( [ vpl ] ) . the lauricella hypergeometric differential equation that @xmath66 satisfies",
    "is defined by @xmath67y=0\\qquad(i=1,\\,2,\\,\\ldots,\\,k),\\label{hgde}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 . using a differentiation formula ( [ dfl ] ) , we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 , the denominator in ( [ vpl ] ) , and then substitution of this into ( [ vpl ] ) yields @xmath72 meanwhile , we consider the hypergeometric differential equation for @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) and find @xmath77 since @xmath78 , equating the sum of the right hand side of ( [ diy ] ) with that of ( [ dy ] ) we successfully eliminate @xmath73 : @xmath79 expand the average velocity as @xmath80 , and substitution of this into ( [ diy ] ) yields a series of equations for @xmath81 . consequently , as @xmath63 tends to infinity , we have @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the average velocity in the thermodynamic limit . solving the series of equations for @xmath84 in turn ,",
    "one can obtain the higher - order correction terms as functions of @xmath85 .",
    "the computations are straightforward , but however the expressions of those terms are too long to be included .    in @xcite , they already obtained the same result as ( [ hvxp ] ) working in the grand - canonical ensemble where the fluctuation of the particle number @xmath63 is allowed .",
    "actually , ( [ hvxp ] ) is consistent with their result , @xmath86\\right ) \\langle n\\rangle = w\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}\\log\\widehat{z}_m(w ) , \\label{hgfp}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 means the expectation value of the particle number in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "since the right hand side of ( [ hvxp ] ) is in a symmetric form with respect to @xmath88 , one can express it using the elementary symmetric functions of them .",
    "recall @xmath52 , and one finds the identity , @xmath89 the left hand side of ( [ i d ] ) is equivalent to the right hand side of ( [ hvxp ] ) if one lets @xmath90 , and thus we find that ( [ hvxp ] ) is equivalent to ( [ hgfp ] ) .",
    "we note that using ( [ hgfp ] ) one has the fundamental diagram in a parametric representation : flux @xmath91 and density @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the parameter . as an example , we illustrate a fundamental diagram choosing a hop probability function that approximately describes motion of vehicles in traffic flow , i.e. , @xmath94 where we let @xmath95 .",
    "note that the hop probability function can be estimated from real traffic data , and ( [ tfm ] ) is often chosen for traffic - flow models @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the exact fundamental diagram illustrated by using ( [ hgfp ] ) with @xmath96 , and the simulation data in addition .",
    "they show complete agreement .    .",
    "these are in good agreement . ]      in the same way as in the case of the parallel update rule , we obtain the fundamental diagram for the zrp with the random sequential update rule . the single - site weight is given in ( [ fr ] ) , and then the generating function for these weights is given as @xmath97,\\label{gfr}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is given in ( [ up ] ) .",
    "then , we can factor ( [ gfr ] ) into @xmath98 and express the partition function by the lauricella hypergeometric function : @xmath99 where the independent variables",
    "@xmath100 satisfy @xmath101 from ( [ vr ] ) and ( [ zr ] ) , the average velocity for the finite numbers , @xmath30 and @xmath63 , is expressed by the lauricella hypergeometric function : @xmath102 thus , applying the formulae for the hypergeometric functions we find @xmath103 as well as the parallel update case , we can expand @xmath104 as a series @xmath105 .    especially in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we recover the result given in@xcite @xmath106 which was obtained within the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "in contrast with the parallel - update case , if @xmath40 tends to infinity , we need to determine the range of parameter @xmath85 . for this purpose",
    ", we impose a simple condition on the hop function , i.e. , @xmath107 which surely allows us to determine the parameter range .",
    "then , the range of values of @xmath85 becomes @xmath108 .",
    "it depends on the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath9 whether @xmath109 converges or not at @xmath110 .",
    "the convergence of @xmath109 is discussed in the context of condensation occurring in the zrp @xcite .",
    "we choose a traffic - flow model with the hop probability function ( [ tfm ] ) and random sequential update rule , and show the exact fundamental diagram and simulation result in figure [ fig2 ] .",

    ") gray line shows the exact solution given in the parametric representation , and black points are simulation data .",
    "numerical simulation is done with site @xmath111 .",
    "these are in good agreement . ]",
    "we consider a simple hop probability function which allows us to provide a direct formula of fundamental diagram instead of the parametric representation , i.e. , @xmath112 substitution of ( [ klauck ] ) into ( [ hgfr ] ) via ( [ gfr ] ) yields @xmath113 accordingly , eliminating @xmath85 we obtain the fundamental diagram explicitly described by @xmath114\\quad\\mbox{where}\\quad q=\\frac\\lambda p.\\label{fdks}\\ ] ] one can also figure out an explicit formula for this model in the case of the parallel update rule ; however , one has to solve a cubic equation .    if we take the limit as @xmath115 ( i.e. , @xmath116 ) in ( [ fdks ] ) , we recover the fundamental diagram of the asep , @xmath117 , which is a well - known solution @xcite .",
    "if we let @xmath118 ( @xmath119 , accordingly ) , then we recover another exact solution given in @xcite , where they obtained the same result by using the matrix - product ansatz .",
    "in this paper , we provide an exact solution of the zero - range process : we have the partition function for the general case , which is expressed by the lauricella hypergeometric function , and which allows us to make further computations .",
    "although the solution obtained is rather formal , that is enough for us to compute expectation values of macroscopic quantities . in particular , using the exact partition function we obtain the average velocity of vehicles for arbitrary numbers of sites and particles .",
    "moreover , expanding the average velocity in terms of the site number , we obtain the fundamental diagram as the leading term of the expansion .",
    "one can also figure out the correction terms through a long computation .    due to the fact that the steady state of the zrp has a factorized form , one can do within equilibrium statistical mechanics while dealing with the macroscopic quantities averaged over all the lattice . in this regard",
    ", one may take @xmath19 as the _ canonical _ partition function in which the particle number is conserved . as a result",
    ", we compute the expectation value of the average velocity within the canonical ensemble . in general , statistical treatment in the canonical ensemble is more difficult than that in the grand canonical ensemble . both results in these ensembles are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit . an analytical approach based on the grand canonical ensemble was previously made to the zrp with the random sequential update rule in @xcite , and to the zrp with the parallel update rule in @xcite . recently , canonical analysis of the condensation is also done @xcite . in this regard , it will be interesting to exactly compute the probability @xmath25 that a single site is to contain @xmath24 particles in the steady state .    recently , as a traffic - flow model",
    ", we introduce _ the stochastic optimal velocity ( sov ) model _",
    "@xcite in the form of combining two exactly solvable models , i.e. , the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite appearing as a special case of the zrp , and the zrp itself ; however it does not seem to us that the model has an exact solution in the general case .",
    "in numerical simulations , we find that the sov model has an intriguing and complex phase transition in the fundamental diagram , and our future goal is to analyse in detail the phase transition observed , e.g. , by using a theoretical method for exactly solvable models .",

    "there are four types of the lauricella hypergeometric function , being denoted by @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath55 .",
    "each of them has a series representation , an integral representation and a differential equation it satisfies .",
    "since only @xmath55 appears in this paper , we confine our attention to @xmath55 .",
    "( see @xcite for details . )",
    "firstly , we define the lauricella hypergeometric function @xmath55 with @xmath40 arguments by @xmath123 where @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are all complex parameters , @xmath127 is the pochhammer symbol , and notations in the right hand side are defined as follows : @xmath128 , then , for @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "we also use the following notations for simplicity : @xmath134 and @xmath100 .    the hypergeometric differential equation for @xmath135",
    "is given in ( [ hgde ] ) .",
    "we omit the integral representation because it is not used in the present work .",
    "we present the generating function for @xmath55 : @xmath136 here , we give a proof of ( [ genl ] ) by mathematical induction .",
    "one should note the relations , @xmath137 and @xmath138    1 .   if @xmath139 , then one has @xmath140 thus , ( [ genl ] ) holds if @xmath139 .",
    "2 .   assume that ( [ genl ] ) holds if @xmath141 , and one accordingly has @xmath142 where @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
