    "( let us remind that the fractal dimension , @xmath7 , is a statistical quantity that gives an indication of how completely a fractal appears to fill space , as one zooms down to finer and finer spatial scales@xcite ) to answer this question , we study the nano structure of a spanning cluster in 3d embedded percolation environment for the creation an object with a fractional dimension . the spanning cluster in such a situation provides the connection between the input and output ( opposite sides ) of the sample . as a result ,",
    "the opportunity to incorporate the spins into such an opened nano structure becomes possible .",
    "forcing the spin ensemble through such a percolation medium allows creating a network of spins , leaving other parts of the system unchanged . since for 3d geometry the fractal dimension of the incipient spanning cluster is @xmath8 ( see e.g. @xcite ,",
    "@xcite ) , in principle , this allows studying experimentally the properties of phase transition in the ising model in geometry with noninteger dimension .",
    "the original idea to study critical behavior for non - integer space by use of a fractal lattice is due to gefen , mandelbrot and aharony@xcite .",
    "the spin model chosen is the ising model , where spins are classical variables taking the values @xmath9 .",
    "the idea suggested by gefen et .",
    "al . was to construct a space domain with noninteger dimension via a fractal lattice ( the sierpinski carpets ) , and then study its critical behavior as a function of the noninteger dimension .",
    "however , in which way could such a critical behavior be studied experimentally in spin- and optoelectronics ?    the ising model near criticality in 2d and 3d dimensions has been studied numerically via monte carlo methods by cambier and nauenberg@xcite .",
    "they considered the system closely below the critical temperature @xmath2 and studied the cluster size distribution .",
    "using such definition of critical clusters , coniglio@xcite was able to compute the fractal dimension of these clusters , by mapping the potts model to the coulomb gas .",
    "the coniglio - klein clusters of the ising model in 3 dimensions have been investigated by wang and stauffer@xcite using monte carlo simulations .",
    "let us recall that for fractals involving a random element , one speaks about a statistical self - similarity , meaning equivalent , after the proper rescaling , statistical distributions characterizing the geometry of a part and of the whole fractal .",
    "it s worth to note that such a compound system ( clusters with spins ) can be created in the experiment if to fill the voids of percolating clusters by nano - particles of a ferromagnetic ( magnetorheological ) fluids that recently were synthesized@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the registration of incipient percolation cluster by optical methods was recently considered in ref.@xcite , while the specific dynamical field properties of radiated nanoemitteres incorporated in a percolating cluster are studied in ref.@xcite .    in a percolation medium filled by the spins ,",
    "there are two distinct physically important order parameters that are defined by a geometrical configuration of the nearest neighbors in such a compound system .",
    "the first ( percolating @xmath10 ) order parameter is defined by the occupation probability of the lattice cells @xmath3 .",
    "the percolation structure normally creates a hollow fractal network of channels that can be filled by a liquid , gas , conductivity electrons , etc .    in this paper",
    "we consider the properties of a 3d percolation medium where the percolation channels are filled by the spins .",
    "the second order parameter ( average magnetization @xmath11 ) depends on the temperature @xmath12 .",
    "we numerically show that the critical properties of such an extended ising model ( eim ) depend on the percolation occupation probability @xmath3 and the temperatures @xmath12 as well .",
    "if the probability @xmath3 is close to @xmath13 ( far from the percolation criticality ) , then the percolation clusters expand throughout the system .",
    "in such a situation , the critical properties of the eim mainly coincide with well - known unbounded case@xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , for a smaller @xmath3 ( closer to the percolation phase transition ) , the system becomes quite inhomogeneous , and does not yet possess a translation symmetry .",
    "as our simulations have shown , even in such a situation , the ferromagnetic phase transition in eim still exists ; however , the critical temperature @xmath2 acquires considerable dependence on the occupation probability @xmath3 . in this case , the dependence @xmath4 is affected by the noninteger fractal dimension of the incipient percolation spanning cluster .",
    "the properties of spins system in @xmath14 disordered mediums are an area of active research@xcite-@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the critical properties of the ising system in a network of percolation @xmath14 clusters are still studied insufficiently .",
    "however , the phase transition of spontaneous magnetization driven by concentration @xmath3 of the pores and spins ( incorporated into such voids ) is very attractive for various applications of quantum spin- and optoelectronics .",
    "as far as the author is aware , the critical properties of ising spins incorporated into a 3d percolation medium has poorly been considered thus far , though it is a logical extension of previous work in this area .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the basic equations and our numerical scheme for studying the structure of @xmath14 percolation clusters is discussed . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the ferromagnetic phase transition of ising magnets incorporated into the spanning cluster , which is considered in sec .",
    "discussion and conclusions from our results are found in the last section .",
    "first , we study the geometrical properties of percolation clusters in a cubic lattice embedded in a 3-dimensional ( 3d ) medium .",
    "it is assumed that the probability @xmath3 for each site of the lattice to be `` occupied '' is given , and we investigate the spatial distribution of the resulting clusters over sizes and other geometrical parameters .",
    "we recall that a cluster here means a conglomerate of occupied sites , which communicate via the nearest - neighbor rule .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    in our algorithm , the connectivity of cluster voids ( pores ) is initially examined locally , so that two pores produce a cluster if they have at least one edge in common .",
    "in such an approach , the spanning occurs when the size of the largest ( spanning ) cluster reaches the size of the system .",
    "the rest of the cluster is referred to as a collection of `` dead '' or `` dangling '' ends . in a large enough sample ,",
    "the internal topology is changed substantially at the critical concentration of the percolation voids @xmath1 .",
    "we have found that such an intrinsic topological structure affects the dimensionality of the percolation transition ; as a result , the connectivity of a percolating network acquires the form of a fractal , see fig.[pic_thrperc ] .",
    "it is worth noting that in the three - dimensional case , no percolation threshold is known exactly ; only numerical data are available@xcite .",
    "fig.[pic_thrperc ] shows the incipient spanning cluster for the supercritical probability @xmath15 when the spanning @xmath14 cluster emerges for the first time forming a fractal network of voids .",
    "in general * * , * * the analysis of such a compound system requires quite long computations .",
    "the first step deals with the identification of the spanning cluster @xmath10 as a function of ocupations probability @xmath3 . in this step",
    ", the percolation system on a lattice is simulated by a random variable @xmath16 that accepts only values @xmath13 or @xmath17 ( with probability @xmath3 ) that defines whether or not a cell is a percolating one .",
    "the percolation order parameter @xmath10 is defined as the ratio of the number of cells belonging to the spanning cluster to the general number of cells . obviously that @xmath10 is distinct from zero only when exceeding the threshold concentration @xmath18 .",
    "corresponding dependencies are shown in fig.[pic_fig1 ] . in the second step ,",
    "the properties of spins incorporated into the percolation structure ( known from the first step ) are evaluated with the use of the monte carlo technique ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . in this step , all values @xmath13 in conducting cells",
    "are replaced ( with probability @xmath19 ) by @xmath20 or @xmath21 instead ; correspondingly parallel or antiparallel spin state in such a cell is generated .",
    "the resulting average magnetization @xmath11 will be defined not only by the temperature @xmath12 ( more details are given below , see eq.([metrop ] ) ) , but also by the occupation probability @xmath3 .",
    "we recall that the nature of a percolation problem as a critical phenomenon is characterized by the critical exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in theory ,",
    "the exponent @xmath22 is related to the intensity of the order parameter @xmath24 ( we supply @xmath24 by index @xmath25 to separate this one from the numerically evaluated quantity @xmath10 ) as@xmath26 and the exponent @xmath23 is related to the correlation length @xmath27 as@xmath28 the latter is a measure of the range over which fluctuations in one region of space are correlated with those in another region .",
    "two points which are separated by a distance larger than the correlation length @xmath27 will each have fluctuations which are independent , that is , uncorrelated .",
    "thus the divergence of the correlation length @xmath27 at the critical point means that points being very far from each other become correlated .",
    "the exponents @xmath29  and @xmath23 are ones of the standard set of critical exponents@xcite that govern the singular behavior of different quantities near the critical point .",
    "these exponents depend only on the dimension of the space and not on the type of lattice or the kind of percolation problem .    in two dimensions ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "these @xmath22  and @xmath23 are known analytically@xcite , @xcite , namely , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "only numerical estimates are available : @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( see table iii in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it has been established that critical exponents @xmath23 and @xmath22 , as well as all others , do not depend on the kind of lattice ( e.g. , square , triangular , etc . ) or the kind of percolation problem ( site or bond ) .",
    "the corresponding power exponents are structurally stable ; that is , they are unchanged by a small perturbation of the lattice model or the mapping , respectively , see @xcite and references therein . from the finite size scaling theory@xcite , @xcite various values of @xmath24 at given values of @xmath3 and @xmath36",
    "can be fitted by a single scaling function @xmath37 ( that depends only on a single variable , but is not otherwise given explicitly by the theory@xcite , @xcite ) that leads to strong dependence of order parameter on the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the dependence @xmath38 on the value @xmath36 is rather weak .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig2.eps    motivated by the essential fractal form of the incipient spanning cluster shown in fig.[pic_thrperc ] , we study the dependence of the fractal dimension of a percolation cluster @xmath5 on probability @xmath3 , see fig.[pic_fig1 ] .",
    "( at calculation @xmath7 it was used the approach @xcite that we have adapted for evaluation of the fractal dimension for 3d spanning cluster . ) from fig.[pic_fig1 ] we observe that the behavior of @xmath5 is separated into two well defined parts : @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in part",
    "@xmath39 for @xmath41 ( when the spanning clusters expand throughout the system ) , the fractal dimension @xmath7 increases very slowly from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( the dimension of the embedded @xmath14 space ) , see fig.[pic_fig1 ] .",
    "however , in the part @xmath40 ( critical zone ) the value @xmath7 increases rapidly from @xmath44 to @xmath42 when @xmath3 increases from the critical probability @xmath45 to @xmath19 . for our simulation",
    "we have used a @xmath14 lattice with @xmath46 where @xmath47 , but since corresponding curves were very closely placed only case @xmath48 in fig.[pic_fig1 ] is shown .    from our numerical data in fig.[pic_fig1 ] we found quite simple analytical formula ( similar the shifted boltzmann distribution ( with respect to @xmath3 ) ) that fits the fractal dimension of the spanning cluster : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the behavior of the percolation order parameter @xmath53  is fitted with great accuracy ( with @xmath54 ) by the expression : @xmath55^{b}$ ] , with @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "this differs from the well - known percolation critical dependence @xmath60  that is valid only in vicinity @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that magnetic `` liquid '' ( spins ) fills up the percolation structure ( from input to output ) , and as a result the network of 3d ising magnets is generated . since the fractal dimension @xmath7 of spanning cluster is noninteger , it is interesting to study the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition in such a compound system ( spins in the percolation cluster ) at the change of temperature @xmath12 ( see eq.([metrop ] ) ) where the energy hamiltonian has well - known form@xcite , @xcite:@xmath62 where @xmath63 ( throughout this paper we set @xmath64 ) is the coupling constant between nearest - neighbor spins @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes that the sum runs over next - neighbor sites . we are interested , if the magnetization @xmath11 in such a percolation fractal system still has critical property of separation in the ordered and disordered magnetic phases . in general",
    ", the spatial non - uniform percolation effects lead to a complicated magnetic energy landscape , so the finding of an optimal energy state becomes a global optimization problem .",
    "the simulations are performed with single spin - flip rates : local changes in the system are accepted with the probability @xmath68 given by the metropolis rate , @xmath69 where @xmath12 is the temperature and @xmath70 is the energy difference corresponding to the proposed single spin flip@xcite,@xcite .",
    "fig.[pic_fig1 ] shows the dependence of the normalized critical temperature @xmath71 of the phase transition @xmath4 on the occupation probability @xmath3 , where @xmath72 is the critical ising temperature for  the unbounded @xmath14 geometry .",
    "( more details are depicted in fig.[pic_mcv ] . )",
    "it is worth to note that the metropolis algorithms shows the critical slowing down that leads to a dramatic increase of temporal scales in vicinity of ferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "this is due to a high energy penalty required to flip a single spin ( or pair of spins ) in a cluster of uniformly oriented neighbors@xcite . to overcome this problem , the cluster algorithms with non - local dynamics , the swendsen - wang@xcite and wolff @xcite approaches commonly used for simulation in the vicinity of the criticality .",
    "as we observe from fig.[pic_fig1 ] beyond of the area of phase transition the metropolis algorithm can be used again for calculation of that average magnetization .    from numerical data shown in fig.[pic_fig1 ]",
    "we have found the expression that fits the dependence of the critical temperature as @xmath73 with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "it is noticeable that in the latter all numerical coefficients @xmath78 have a rather slow dependence on the system size @xmath36 .    as already it was mentioned in the above such an extended ising system",

    "it is instructively to compare the behavior with respect of @xmath3 other quantities that are closely connected with both @xmath79 and @xmath11 , namely the fractal dimension of percolation clusters @xmath5 ( [ dh ] ) and critical temperature of the ferromagnetic phase transition @xmath4 ( [ tc ] ) correspondingly . from fig.[pic_fig1 ] we observe that in area of part @xmath39 ( where @xmath80 ) the dependence @xmath4 is practically lineal ; for such an area ( @xmath81 ) in @xmath4 , the exponential term @xmath82 is negligibly small .",
    "however , in zone @xmath40 , where @xmath7 is noninteger , the term @xmath83 sufficiently affects the linear dependence @xmath4 : in such a zone @xmath2 slowly depends on @xmath3 , and @xmath84 .",

    "fig.[pic_mcv ] ( b ) shows that the specific heat @xmath86 has well defined peak at the critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the value of the critical temperature @xmath2 strongly depends on the probability @xmath3 : @xmath4 decreases with decreased @xmath3 .",
    "we found that the critical behavior @xmath85 and @xmath86 is similar to the unbounded case , but with the shift of the critical temperature dependent on probability @xmath3 .",
    "fig.[pic_fig1 ] shows that for area @xmath39 fractal dimension @xmath89 the of percolation cluster is nearly equal to the dimension of embedded space @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is close to the cluster order parameter @xmath53 up to the critical zone @xmath40 .",

    "since the percolation spanning cluster still has a significant number of spins , we can conclude that in this area the topologically nontrivial magnetic structure arises ; as a result , the critical behavior of @xmath11 and @xmath93 is strongly affected by the noninteger fractal dimension of the percolation clusters .",
