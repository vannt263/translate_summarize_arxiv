    "explicit supergravity solutions of pure and matter - coupled supergravity in diverse dimensions play an important role in the study of solitonic and instantonic states of superstring theory , in particular @xmath3-brane states @xcite .    indeed one large , diversified and important class of supergravity solutions is provided by the @xmath3-brane ones that are divided in two subclasses :    * the space - like @xmath3-brane solutions that have an euclidian world - volume and are time - dependent , all fields being functions of the time parameter @xmath12 . * the time - like @xmath3-brane solutions that have a minkowskian world volume and are stationary , the fields depending on another parameter @xmath12 , typically measuring the distance from the brane .    a view - point independently introduced in @xcite and @xcite , and systematically developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , identified , at least for space - branes , the field equations of supergravity corresponding to such solutions with the geodesic equations on the corresponding moduli space that is mostly a homogeneous space and most frequently also a symmetric space @xmath13 .",
    "this identification allowed the in - depth study of supergravity cosmic billiards @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and lead to the discovery of their complete integrability @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it was an idea already circulating for some time in the community that also the construction of time - like @xmath3-branes , in particular rotational symmetric black - hole solutions , could be reduced to the problem of geodesic motion on appropriate moduli spaces that would , this time , be lorentzian rather euclidean coset manifolds @xmath2 .",
    "this idea found a precise formulation in the recent publication @xcite .    in connection with these applications",
    ", the question of integrability of the differential systems of equations describing geodesic motion on homogeneous spaces and in particular on symmetric non - compact cosets @xmath13 , acquires particular relevance . as we emphasize in section [ sezionedue ] , this question is intimately related with the issue of _ normed solvable lie algebras _ , namely solvable lie algebras @xmath14 equipped with a non - degenerate norm @xmath15 , which is positive definite in the space - brane ( = billiard ) case and indefinite in the time - brane ( = black hole ) case .    in this paper , by performing a change of logical reference frame that replaces the route from geometry to lie algebra into the opposite one and by gluing together pieces of mathematical knowledge dispersed in the literature , we show that :    1 .   the integrability of all the various homogeneous models , both euclidian and lorentzian follows from the liouville integrability of a universal parent model , associated with the borel subalgebra @xmath16 of the @xmath17 lie algebra .",
    "the integrability of the parent extends to its children algebras @xmath14 if the always existing embedding @xmath18 is adequate .",
    "liouville integrability of @xmath16 is an intrinsic property of this algebra which allows to construct an adequate number of universal hamiltonians @xmath19 in involution .",
    "the norm @xmath15 on any solvable lie algebra @xmath14 is not an independent external datum , rather it is intrinsically defined by the restriction to @xmath14 of the unique quadratic hamiltonian @xmath20 on @xmath16 , once the embedding @xmath21 has been defined .",
    "all symmetric coset models @xmath2 defined as follows have integrable geodesic equations .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath22 of the numerator is non - compact and the lie algebra @xmath23 of the denominator is any of the real sections contained in @xmath22 of the complexification @xmath24 of @xmath25 , the former being the maximal compact subalgebra of the latter .",
    "the explicit integration algorithm has a universal form .    based on our new view - point",
    "we also present a new algorithmic approach to the study of the ( eventual ) integrability of homogeneous normal spaces that are not symmetric spaces , leaving however the actual use of such an algorithm to future publications .",
    "in this section we first summarize the basic facts about the riemannian or pseudo - riemannian structures that can be defined on a _ normed _ solvable lie algebra .",
    "our goal is that of reviewing the construction of the so named nomizu connection and of its associated geodesic differential equations .",
    "the reason is that we aim at a copernican revolution . in this context , the classical route was from riemannian geometry to lie algebra theory since the problems that motivated the consideration of such mathematical structures were differential geometric in nature : in particular the geometry of scalar manifolds appearing in supergravity theories .",
    "it was very helpful and rewarding to find a translation vocabulary that allowed the reformulation of riemannian geometry into a purely lie algebraic setup . yet , in relation with integrability , this classical route obscures one relevant fact : integrability ( when it exists ) is an a priori intrinsic property of the solvable lie algebra .",
    "this property is intelligently , yet secretly , utilized by the ( pseudo)-riemannian structures .",
    "hence , following our announced copernican revolution , we aim at reverting the route , going from solvable lie algebra theory to ( pseudo)-riemanian geometry , rather than vice - versa .",
    "this change of reference frame will prove very helpful in view of old mathematical results , that were a little bit known in the literature on non - linear science @xcite , @xcite , @xcite but which had so far completely escaped consideration in the current supergravity and superstring literature .    in the next subsection",
    "we prepare our copernican revolution with a short review of the ptolemaic system .",
    "let us consider a solvable lie algebra @xmath14 .",
    "for instance @xmath14 can be the borel subalgebra of a complex semi - simple lie algebra @xmath26 , namely , its borel subalgebra @xmath27 is defined as the solvable algebra spanned by all the cartan generators @xmath28 and by all the step operators @xmath29 associated with all positive roots @xmath30 . ] : @xmath31 or it can be the solvable lie algebra canonically associated with the pair made by a real form @xmath32 of @xmath26 and by its maximal compact subalgebra @xmath33 : @xmath34 other relevant choices of the solvable lie algebra @xmath14 can be made among those associated with the classification of homogeneous special geometries that appear in the coupling to matter of supergravity theories with eight supercharges in @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 dimensions - map framework @xcite of supergravity with the work of de wit et .",

    "the conjecture of alekseevsky was just restricted to quaternionic khler manifolds and implied that any such manifold @xmath47 that was also homogeneous and of negative ricci curvature should be normal , in the sense over mentioned , namely a transitive solvable group of isometries @xmath48 $ ] should exist , that could be identified with the manifold itself . note that the actual group of isometries @xmath49 of @xmath47 could be much larger than the solvable group , @xmath50~,\\ ] ] as it is for instance the case for all symmetric spaces @xmath51 yet the solvable normed lie algebra @xmath52 had to exist .",
    "the problem of classifying the considered manifolds was turned in this way into the problem of classifying the _ normal metric solvable lie algebras _ @xmath53 .",
    "note that in alekseevsky s case the symmetric form @xmath54 was not only required to be positive definite but also quaternionic khler .",
    "alekseevsky s conjecture actually applies to more general homogeneous riemannian manifolds than the quaternionic ones : for instance it applies to all those endowed with a special khler geometry or with a real special one as the classification of de wit et .",
    "al . @xcite demonstrated .",
    "it also applies to the symmetric spaces appearing in the scalar sector of extended supergravities with more than eight supercharges .",
    "for all these manifolds there exists the corresponding normal metric algebra @xmath53 , in other words they are _ normal_.",

    "( [ identifico ] ) applies .",
    "@xmath57    proving such a conjecture amounts to proving that for every homogeneous einstein manifold the group of isometries @xmath49 , which by hypothesis of homogeneity exists and has a transitive action on the manifold , admits a solvable _ _ simply transitive subgroup _ _",

    "the recollection of these well known facts was done in order to emphasize the following point . in the ptolemaic system that starts from riemannian geometry and",
    "arrives at solvable lie algebras @xmath14 , this latter emerges in conjunction with a well defined metric form @xmath59 defined over it .",
    "for instance if we focus on borel solvable algebras @xmath60 , they are endowed with the following canonical metric : @xmath61 whose normalization is absolute if the generators @xmath62 of the weyl - cartan basis for @xmath26 have the standard normalization @xmath63 & = & 0~ , \\nonumber\\\\    \\left [ \\mathcal{h}_i\\ , , \\ , e^\\alpha \\right ] & = & \\alpha_i \\ , e^\\alpha ~,\\nonumber\\\\    \\left [ e^\\alpha \\ , , \\ , e^\\beta \\right ] & = & n(\\alpha,\\beta ) \\ ,    e^{\\alpha + \\beta } \\quad \\mbox{if $ \\alpha+\\beta$ is a root } \\quad ; \\quad |n(\\alpha,\\beta)| = 1 ~,\\nonumber \\\\",

    "it turns out that @xmath60 is just the solvable lie algebra of this riemannian manifold @xmath47 @xmath68 and the metric @xmath59 ( [ canonicb ] ) on the solvable lie algebra @xmath56 is that induced by the unique einstein riemannian metric on the corresponding coset @xmath69 ( [ maxisplit ] ) .",
    "similarly it happens in all other constructions of the ptolemaic system .",
    "the requirements imposed on the final riemannian einstein manifold one wants to construct predetermine the metric @xmath70 on the solvable lie algebra .",
    "once the metric form is given , the construction of geometry and of the associated geodesic equations follow uniquely .",
    "the issue is just that of calculating the levi  civita connection of the metric @xmath71 induced on the manifold by the form @xmath59 defined on the solvable lie algebra .",

    "equivalently , we can define the levi  civita  nomizu connection starting from the dual description of the solvable lie algebra in terms of maurer  cartan equations .",
    "let @xmath78 be a basis of maurer ",

    "we have @xmath81 interpreting @xmath78 as the vielbein over the solvable group manifold we write the vanishing torsion equation @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the standard @xmath84lie algebra valued spin connection ( @xmath85  ) .",
    "the relation between the two descriptions is immediate : @xmath86 where the tensor @xmath87 is automatically antisymmetric in force of its definition .",
    "given the connection coefficients the differential geodesic equations can be immediately written . in the chosen basis the tangent vector to the geodesic is described by @xmath88 fields @xmath89 which depend on the affine parameter @xmath12 along the curve .",
    "the geodesic equation is given by the following first order differential system : @xmath90 the above equation contains two data :    1 ) : :    the structure constants of the solvable lie algebra    @xmath91 , 2 ) : :    the metric tensor @xmath92 .    as we emphasized the second datum ,",
    "namely the metric , comes down , in the ptolemaic system from the geometric interpretation of the differential system ( [ geoeque ] ) as geodesic equations on a riemannian einstein manifold and it is the metric of that manifold what eventually predetermines @xmath92 .",
    "let us now implement our copernican revolution and let us forget for a moment about the riemannian structure .",
    "the system ( [ geoeque ] ) is just a non linear differential system defined over the dual @xmath93 of a solvable lie algebra @xmath14 .",
    "how could we directly derive such a differential system and may be established its liouville integrability from the very structure of @xmath14 ?",
    "is there a way of deriving the metric tensor implicitly contained in ( [ geoeque ] ) from the lie algebra @xmath14 ? there is .",
    "given the solvable lie algebra @xmath14 we can consider the co - adjoint orbits of the corresponding solvable group @xmath94 $ ] . in simple language",
    "this amounts to consider functions defined over the dual lie algebra @xmath93 .",
    "an element of @xmath95 is a linear functional @xmath96 and using a general theorem in linear algebra the dual of a finite dimensional vector space is isomorphic to the same space . in practice ,",
    "given a basis @xmath97 of @xmath14 we immediately obtain the dual basis @xmath98 by defining @xmath99 any dual lie algebra element @xmath100 can be written as a linear combination of the dual generators @xmath101 and the most general function @xmath102 on @xmath95 is actually a function of the @xmath88 coordinates @xmath103 .",
    "given any two such functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 we can define their lie  poisson bracket in the following manner : @xmath106 in this way the space of co - adjoint orbits becomes a poisson manifold , independently from the existence of any metric @xmath43 on @xmath14 .",
    "then one is allowed to consider evolution equations of the following form : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is some function on the dual lie algebra @xmath95 that we can regard as the hamiltonian .",
    "the question is whether the geodesic equations ( [ geoeque ] ) can be put in the hamiltonian form ( [ eulerhamilton ] ) , namely , whether there exists a hamiltonian function , necessarily quadratic , which reproduces the levi  civita  nomizu connection .",
    "the answer is obviously yes . it suffices to write @xmath109 and identify the variables @xmath110 and @xmath111 through the relation @xmath112 both in eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) and in eq.([sugiu ] ) there appears the metric @xmath92 defined by the non degenerate normal form @xmath113 .",
    "hence it may seem that we made no real progress and we simply rewrote the same equations in a different style .",
    "the notion of the metric tensor is still essential and it looks external to the pure lie algebraic structure .",
    "it is not so , as it appears from the following argument .",
    "the key point we would like to emphasize is that the definition of the lie ",
    "poisson bracket ( [ poisson ] ) depends only on the structure constants of the algebra @xmath14 and nothing else , so it is intrinsic to the algebra .",
    "let us next recall the notion of liouville integrability .    a symplectic manifold of dimension @xmath114 endowed with a lie  poisson bracket @xmath115 is liouville integrable if there exists @xmath116 functionally independent functions @xmath117 of its @xmath114 coordinates @xmath118 that are in involution",

    "let us now envisage the following :      given the solvable lie algebra @xmath14 , whose dimension we denote @xmath124 imagine that with respect to its intrinsic lie ",
    "poissonian structure ( [ poisson ] ) there exist @xmath125 functions @xmath126 of the coordinates @xmath127 on @xmath95 that are in involution @xmath128 with the integer @xmath125 lying in the range : @xmath129\\ ] ] and suppose furthermore that , having defined the integer @xmath130 precisely @xmath131 of the functions @xmath126 , which , for this reason we rename @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) , are _ casimirs _ , namely they commute with all the coordinates : @xmath134 under these hypotheses , by rearranging the set of involutive functions as it follows : @xmath135 we obtain the following situation .",
    "level surfaces _",
    "@xmath136 defined by setting the @xmath131 casimirs to fixed values @xmath137 are by definition manifolds of even dimension : @xmath138 and on these manifolds there exist exactly @xmath139 functions in involution , namely the @xmath140 of eq.([rearrangio ] ) .",
    "it follows that each of these manifolds acquires a symplectic hamiltonian structure .",
    "naming @xmath118 the @xmath141 coordinates on @xmath136 and choosing as hamiltonian any linear combination of the pull - backs on @xmath136 of the functions @xmath140 @xmath142 the corresponding euler equation differential system @xmath143 is by construction liouville integrable .",
    "indeed the pull - backs of the @xmath139 functions @xmath140 provide the necessary first integrals of motion .",
    "the above described scenario is precisely realized in a very notable case , namely that of the borel subalgebra @xmath145 . as it is well known the simple lie algebra @xmath17 , identified by the following dynkin diagram :    ( 100,100 ) ( -70,85)@xmath17 ( -20,90 ) ( -23,75)@xmath146 ( -15,90)(1,0)20 ( 10,90 ) ( 7,75)@xmath147 ( 15,90)(1,0)20 ( 40,90 ) ( 37,75)@xmath148 ( 47,90)@xmath149 ( 70,90 ) ( 67,75)@xmath150 ( 75,90)(1,0)20 ( 100,90 ) ( 97,75)@xmath151 ( 105,90)(1,0)20 ( 130,90 ) ( 127,75)@xmath152    is the abstract form of the lie algebra @xmath153 of complex traceless matrices in dimension @xmath154 . the corresponding borel subalgebra @xmath155 is simply given by the subset of all upper triangular traceless matrices .",
    "it is more convenient to relax the condition on the trace and consider the borel subalgebra @xmath156 which is simply made by all upper triangular matrices .",
    "reduction to @xmath157 will be performed by putting one of the casimirs to the null value .",
    "hence we define @xmath158 the dimension of this solvable algebra is easily computed @xmath159 it was demonstrated by arhangelskii in @xcite that this poissonian manifold is liouville integrable according to the scheme described in the previous subsection and the procedure to construct the required set of functions in involution was described in @xcite .",
    "let us review these results .",
    "we distinguish the two cases where @xmath160 is even and where @xmath161 is odd .",
    "the number @xmath162 of functions in involution , the number of casimirs and the ensuing even dimension of the orbits is displayed below : @xmath163 for the reader s convenience in table [ troika ] we tabulated the first instances of such numbers .",
    "@xmath164      how are the functions @xmath165 explicitly constructed ?",
    "first let us observe that a simple set of coordinates on the borel subalgebra @xmath166 is simply given by the entries of the upper triangular matrix @xmath167 mentioned in eq.([borelliano ] ) .",
    "secondly , for reasons that will become clear later on , let us consider an @xmath168 matrix @xmath169 which satisfies the condition @xmath170 where @xmath171 is any of the available choices of @xmath172 signatures in dimension @xmath154 .",
    "irrespectively of the choice of @xmath173 , the number of parameters contained in a matrix @xmath169 satisfying ( [ laxprop ] ) is always equal to @xmath174 which is the dimension of the borel algebra @xmath175 .",
    "indeed there is a simple one - to - one map from the space of upper triangular matrices to the space of matrices satisfying eq.([laxprop ] ) , which reads as follows : @xmath176 in the above equation we have used the following convention . for any matrix @xmath177 , we denote by @xmath178 its upper triangular part and by @xmath179 its lower triangular one including the diagonals .",
    "hence the space of matrices fulfilling eq.([laxprop ] ) provides a coordinate basis for the borel algebra .",
    "thanks to the simple relation ( [ mappino ] ) , the use of different @xmath173 tensors just amounts to a _ linear coordinate transformation _ on @xmath180 , in other words to a change of basis for the generators of the solvable lie algebra .",
    "what is then the relevance of considering such different choices of @xmath173 rather than focusing on a single conventional one ?",
    "the answer is elementary .",
    "each different @xmath173 prepares a basis well adapted to the decomposition of the lie algebra @xmath181 with respect to its subalgebra @xmath182 .",
    "such a decomposition is necessary in order to study the geometry and the associated geodesic equations of the coset manifold @xmath183 all these @xmath172 systems are integrable since all the manifolds @xmath184 are metrically equivalent to the same solvable manifold @xmath185 $ ] , equipped however with a different normal form @xmath186 , which is positive definite only for @xmath187 .",
    "the liouville integrability of all these systems has the same common root , namely the existence of the @xmath162 independent functions in involution that now we display and which is an intrinsic property of the borel algebra @xmath188 .",
    "the algorithm of constructing these functions , originally derived for @xmath187 in @xcite and @xcite , being generalized to the case under consideration , is the following .    starting from the parameterization of @xmath189 by means of the matrix @xmath169 ( [ mappino ] ) fulfilling eq.([laxprop ] ) the complete set of @xmath162 functions @xmath190 that are involutive with respect to the lie ",

    "the problem is very simply solved by recalling the quadratic form ( [ hamil ] ) of the hamiltonian which yields the geodesic equations associated with the levi  civita  nomizu connection .",

    "<S> in this paper we show that the supergravity equations describing both cosmic billiards and a large class of black - holes are , generically , both liouville integrable as a consequence of the same universal mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this latter is provided by the liouville integrable poissonian structure existing on the dual borel algebra @xmath0 of the simple lie algebra @xmath1 . as a by product </S>",
    "<S> we derive the explicit integration algorithm associated with all symmetric spaces @xmath2 relevant to the description of time - like and space - like @xmath3-branes . </S>",
    "<S> the most important consequence of our approach is the explicit construction of a complete set of conserved involutive hamiltonians @xmath4 that are responsible for integrability and provide a new tool to classify flows and orbits . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that these will prove a very important new tool in the analysis of supergravity black holes and billiards .    0.2 cm     +   + pietro fr@xmath5 and alexander s. sorin@xmath6   +   + _ @xmath7 italian embassy in the russian federation , + denezhny pereulok , 5 , 121002 moscow , russia + pietro.fre@esteri.it + and + dipartimento di fisica teorica , universit di torino , _ + _ @xmath8 infn - sezione di torino _ + _ via p. giuria 1 , i-10125 torino , italy </S>",
