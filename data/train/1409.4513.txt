    "in this paper we have presented a theory for the fluctuations of atom number and components of spin in a spinor condensate .",
    "our theory is based around the idea of gaussian measurement cells which approximate finite resolution measurements that could be made in experiments , e.g. , using dispersive _ in situ _ imaging .    our results for the spin-1 system demonstrate how aspects of the magnetic phases are revealed by fluctuations in the various quantities considered .",
    "importantly , the spin fluctuations are typically dominated by the magnon excitations of the system , and are sensitive to whether these are gapped or gapless . notably , gapless nambu - goldstone magnons arise from spontaneously broken axial spin symmetry in the af and ba phases . for the ba phase we showed that this leads to a divergence in a transverse spin component , which could be measured as a non - extensive scaling of the fluctuations . for the af phase the equivalent divergence occurs in a component of the nematic density fluctuations .",
    "our formalism naturally includes nematic fluctuations , although we did not present results for these in this paper .",
    "however , we note dispersive imaging techniques are also capable of measuring nematic density",
    ".    another important feature of our results is the diverse range of length and temperature scales governing the relevant fluctuations .",
    "this occurs because the typical scales of density and spin interaction energies differ by roughly two orders of magnitude in rubidium and sodium spinor condensates .",
    "thus , while the density correlation lengths are typically smaller than a micron and not resolvable with optical probing , the spin correlation lengths are much larger , and easily resolved .",
    "this will make it feasible to explore the role of cell size in fluctuation measurements .",
    "there are several exciting possibilities for future development of the ideas presented here .",
    "first , the extension to higher spin systems is immediate .",
    "second , it would be interesting to include the role of dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "these interactions are quite weak for the case of @xmath1rb , but can have an appreciable role on the low energy spectrum , which would affect large - cell fluctuation measurements ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , beyond the bogoliubov approach we presented here there are many avenues for extending the theory including the role of quantum and thermal back - action on the condensate @xcite and detailed behaviour of the system near phase boundaries ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
