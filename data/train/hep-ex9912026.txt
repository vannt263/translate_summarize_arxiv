    "the purely leptonic determinations ( which do not depend upon the quark coupling asymmetries @xmath7 ) are shown on the left - hand side of the plot : @xmath48 , @xmath39 ( from the leptonic left - right forward - backward asymmetry analysis ) , @xmath38 , @xmath49 ( from @xmath50 ) , and @xmath51 ( from @xmath50 ) .",

    "the solid horizontal line shows the average of all techniques , @xmath56 note that the fit of the eight measurements to a single value has a @xmath57 per degree of freedom of 13.3/7 which has a probability of 6.5% .",
    "this is acceptable but may also indicate that the single - value hypothesis is flawed . if the leptonic and hadronic determinations are averaged separately ( see the dashed and dash - dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : swein ] ) , the fit probabilities improve markedly to 49% and 95% , respectively .",
    "another strange feature is that the two most precise determinations of @xmath10 are @xmath48 and @xmath52 which disagree with one another by 3.0  @xmath9 .",
    "[ hbt ]    there are several possible explanations for this modest discrepancy :    1 .",
    "the deviations are simply the result of statistical fluctuations .",
    "unknown systematic effects are distorting some or all of the results .",
    "we are seeing evidence of new physics .",
    "another manifestation of this discrepancy was the deviation of @xmath4 from the msm when the world average @xmath58 was used to extract @xmath4 from @xmath52 .",
    "the sld direct determination of @xmath4 is a check on this idea . a graphical representation of this problem is shown in fig .  [ fig : alab ] .",
    "the measurements of @xmath39 , @xmath4 and @xmath59 are plotted as 68% confidence regions in @xmath39-@xmath4 space .",
    "we note that they do tend to overlap in a region away from the msm prediction which appears as a horizontal line ( for @xmath60  gev @xcite and 100  gev@xmath61  tev ) .",

    "[ hbt ]    examining fig .",
    "[ fig : st ] , we can see that the @xmath10-band is the smallest and provides the most information .",
    "due to recent improvements , the measurement of @xmath68 now provides the second most precise input , and is slightly ahead of @xmath70 .",
    "the data are clearly consistent with the msm and favor a `` light '' higgs boson .",
    "this observation can be made more quantitative by applying @xmath60  gev as a constraint , and fitting the @xmath65-@xmath66 likelihood function for @xmath77 .",
    "the 95% one - sided confidence limit on the higgs mass is 217  gev .",
    "it is interesting to note that the possible @xmath4 anomaly discussed in section  [ sec : swein ] does affect these conclusions somewhat . excluding the three hadronic determinations of @xmath10 from the @xmath65-@xmath66 analysis , changes the picture to the one presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : stleptons ] .",
    "note that the @xmath65-@xmath66 region determined by the leptonic measurements of @xmath10 is still the smallest , but the agreement with the msm becomes marginal .",
    "the standard model region is nearly excluded by a 95% one - sided confidence interval in @xmath65 .",

    "* the era of @xmath0-pole electroweak physics has come to an end . *",

    "it is the third most precisely determined electroweak parameter and used as an input to the theory . * * the other lineshape parameters are measured at the @xmath47 level which is an experimental tour - de - force and leads to the remarkably precise determination of the invisible width and the conclusion that there are three light neutrinos and essentially no width for other unseen processes . * * the effective weak mixing angle @xmath10 determines most of what we know about loop - level processes .",
    "* there is generally good agreement with the minimal standard model but there are still some lingering inconsistencies with leptonic and hadronic determinations of @xmath10 : * * the measurements of @xmath4 are anomalous by @xmath80 . *",
    "* the inconsistency has consequence for the interpretation of the data in terms of the msm .",
    "if there is an anomaly in the @xmath62 couplings , then the agreement of the data and msm is marginal .",
