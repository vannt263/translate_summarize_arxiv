    "quantum accelerator modes are characterized by the efficient transfer of large momenta to laser - cooled atoms by repeated application of a spatially periodic potential @xcite .",
    "quantum accelerator modes therefore constitute a potentially versatile technique for manipulating the momentum distribution of cold and ultracold atoms .",
    "following the first observation of quantum accelerator modes @xcite there has been substantial progress in developing a theoretical understanding of the mechanisms and structure that underpin them @xcite .",
    "this has permitted the observation and categorization of higher - order quantum accelerator modes @xcite , demonstration that the momentum is transferred coherently @xcite , observation of the sensitivity of the dynamics to a control parameter @xcite , and characterization of the mode structure in terms of number theory @xcite .",
    "quantum random walks have received attention due to their markedly non - classical dynamics and their potential application as search algorithms in practical realizations of quantum information processors @xcite . in this paper , we report an investigation into the use of high - order quantum accelerator modes to implement a quantum random walk in the momentum space distribution of cold atoms @xcite .",
    "this method is more robust and easier compared with other recent proposals for implementing quantum random walks using ion traps @xcite , microwave or optical cavities @xcite and optical lattices @xcite , and should make feasible quantum random walks of a few hundred steps .",
    "this would be a useful experimental tool for information processing .    in this paper we first survey the experimental phenomenology and theoretical understanding of quantum accelerator modes .",
    "we then discuss how the generation of specific quantum accelerator modes can be experimentally controlled .",
    "based on these techniques , we explain how internal - state - dependent momentum transfer can be achieved , which will permit coherent beam - splitting . finally , we show how this could be applied to realize experimentally a biased quantum random walk procedure .",
    "quantum accelerator modes are observed in the @xmath0-kicked accelerator system @xcite . in the atom optical realization of this system ,",
    "a pulsed , vertical standing wave of laser light is applied to a cloud of laser - cooled atoms @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian can be written : @xmath1\\sum_{n}\\delta ( t - nt ) , \\label{eq : hcom}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the vertical position , @xmath3 is the momentum , @xmath4 is the atomic mass , @xmath5 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath6 the time , @xmath7 the kicking pulse period , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the spatial period of the potential applied to the atoms , and @xmath10 quantifies the kicking strength of laser pulses , i.e. the laser intensity .",
    "this hamiltonian is identical to that of the @xmath0-kicked rotor , as studied experimentally by the groups in austin @xcite , auckland @xcite , lille @xcite , otago @xcite , london @xcite , and gaithersburg @xcite , apart from the addition of the linear gravitational potential @xmath11 ; this linear potential is critical to the generation of the quantum accelerator modes .    in the experiments performed to date to observe quantum accelerator modes ,",
    "cesium atoms are trapped and cooled in a magneto - optic trap to a temperature of @xmath12k .",
    "they are then released from the trap and , while they fall , a series of standing wave pulses is applied to them . following the pulse sequence ,",
    "the momentum distribution of the atoms is measured by a time of flight method , in which the absorption of the atoms from a sheet of on - resonant light through which they fall is measured .",
    "the quantum accelerator modes are characterized by the efficient transfer of momentum , linear with pulse number , to a significant fraction ( @xmath13% ) of the atomic ensemble .",
    "the spatially periodic potential experienced by the atoms in the far off - resonant standing light wave is due to the ac stark shift .",
    "we can therefore write @xmath14 @xcite , where @xmath15 is the rabi frequency at the intensity maxima of the standing wave , @xmath16 is the pulse duration and @xmath17 is the red - detuning of the laser frequency from the @xmath18 , ( @xmath19 ) d1 transition of cesium . in these experiments ,",
    "the standing wave light is produced by a ti : sapphire laser ; the maximum intensity of the laser beam is @xmath20 mw @xmath21 . within the regime where spontaneous emission can be ignored @xcite",
    ", the detuning can be modified over a range of order @xmath22ghz , so that the kicking strength can be changed by roughly an order of magnitude . if @xmath23s@xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "quantum accelerator modes may be observed in @xmath0-kicked accelerator dynamics when @xmath7 is close to values at which low - order quantum resonances occur in the quantum @xmath26-kicked rotor , i.e. integer multiples of the half - talbot time @xmath27 ( so named because of a similarity of this quantum resonance phenomenon to the talbot effect in classical optics ) . in the case of the oxford experiment , @xmath28s @xcite .      in 2002",
    "fishman , guarneri , and rebuzzini ( fgr ) @xcite used an innovative analysis , termed the @xmath29-classical expansion , to explain the occurrence and characteristics of the observed quantum accelerator modes .",
    "this theoretical framework predicted the existence of higher - order modes , which was subsequently verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "our later discussion focuses on these higher - order modes , so we briefly summarize the @xmath29-classical theory here .    in the @xmath0-kicked rotor , the spatial periodicity of the kicking potential means that momentum is imparted in integer multiples of @xmath30",
    "this spatial periodicity also means that the dynamics of any initial atomic momentum state are equivalent to those of a state in the first brillouin zone , @xmath31 , i.e. , the momentum modulo @xmath30 .",
    "this is the quasimomentum , and hence it is a conserved quantity in the kicking process @xcite .",
    "the presence of gravitational acceleration in the @xmath0-kicked accelerator breaks this periodic translational symmetry . transforming to a freely - falling frame removes the @xmath32 term from the hamiltonian ; consequently quasimomentum conservation is observed , _ in the freely - falling frame_. conservation of quasimomentum means that different quasimomentum subspaces evolve independently .",
    "the fgr theory makes use of this property to decompose the system into an assembly of `` @xmath33-rotors '' @xcite , where the quasimomentum @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the linear potential due to gravity makes its presence felt by changing , relative to the case of the @xmath0-kicked rotor , the phase accumulated over the free evolution between kicks .",
    "this means that quantum resonance phenomena different from those observed in the @xmath0-kicked rotor occur . for values of @xmath7 close to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , certain states permit rephasing , and hence , within any given quasimomentum subspace , the projection of the initial condition onto states which are appropriately localized within ( periodic ) position _ and _ momentum space are coherently accelerated away from the background atomic cloud .",
    "the momentum of the accelerated population increases linearly with the number of kicks , and it is this which constitutes a quantum accelerator mode .    the closeness of the kicking period @xmath7 to integer multiples of the half - talbot time @xmath38 is formalized in the fgr theory by the smallness parameter @xmath39 . in the limit of @xmath40 it is possible to simplify the dynamics of the operator - valued observables to a set of effective classical ( or _ pseudoclassical _ ) mapping equations , separate but identical for each independently evolving quasimomentum subspace , or @xmath33-rotor .",
    "if we define the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 , these mapping equations can be written :    @xmath43    [ eq : mapping ]    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the transformed momentum and position variables , respectively , just before the @xmath46th kick .",
    "a quantum accelerator mode corresponds to a stable island system , centered on a periodic orbit , in the stroboscopic phase space generated by the mapping of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mapping ] ) .",
    "as the dynamics of interest take place within stable islands and are therefore approximately harmonic , the usefulness of this pseudoclassical picture actually extends over a broader range of @xmath29 than might otherwise be expected @xcite .",
    "a given island system is specified by the pair of numbers @xmath47 , the order of the fixed point , and @xmath48 , the jumping index , and the quantum accelerator mode can be likewise classified .",
    "physically , @xmath47 is the number of pulse periods a `` particle '' initially on a periodic orbit takes before cycling back to the initial point in the reduced phase - space cell , while @xmath48 is the number of unit cells of extended phase space traversed by this particle in the momentum direction per cycle , i.e. , @xmath49 . transforming back to the conventional linear momentum in the accelerating frame ,",
    "after @xmath50 kicks , the momentum of the accelerated atoms is given by : @xmath51 \\frac{\\hbar g } { |\\epsilon |}. \\label{eq : moment}\\ ] ]    the first quantum accelerator modes to be observed were those for which @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "since then , others with orders as high as @xmath53 have been observed @xcite . we shall now focus on these higher - order modes .      the phase space generated by application of the mappings of eq .  ( [ eq : mapping ] ) changes as the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are varied . in experiments to date , @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "have generally been varied simultaneously by scanning @xmath7 , and hence also @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the structure of phase space may also be altered by varying @xmath10 , and hence @xmath54 alone , or by varying @xmath5 , and hence @xmath55 alone . as the phase space changes , two or more distinct island chains , specified by different @xmath56 , can coexist .",
    "this means that the corresponding quantum accelerator modes can be simultaneously produced by kicking the atoms .",
    "hence different amounts of momentum can be transferred to several classes of the atoms evolving from the initial ensemble .",

    "within a given parameter regime , i.e. , for particular values of @xmath10 and @xmath5 , and restricting ourselves to a single plane - wave as the initial condition , it is not possible to optimally occupy two quantum accelerator modes for simultaneous acceleration .",
    "this can be understood by realizing that coexisting quantum accelerator modes must necessarily occupy different regions of pseudoclassical phase space .    an efficient way to obtain simultaneous momentum transfer in two directions is to start with a coherent superposition of internal atomic states so as to optimally change @xmath76 separately .",
