    "in the context of the hierarchical clustering scenarios for galaxy evolution , all galaxies in the present day are considered to acquire their masses by successive mergers of small building blocks of galaxies ( e.g. , white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "indeed , most galaxies observed in high - redshift universe are generally much smaller and much less massive than the present galaxies ( ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ; van dokkum et al . 2008",
    "; taniguchi et al .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the formation and early evolution of galaxies , it is necessary to explore which types of building blocks of galaxies were present and how the mass assembly process proceeded in the early universe .",
    "here a question arises as `` are there any relics of such building blocks in the nearby universe ? '' .",
    "the best candidates are both gas - rich dwarf galaxies and irregular galaxies because these galaxies have a large amount of gaseous components even now ( e.g. , gallagher & hunter 1984 ; hunter & gallagher 1986 ; hunter et al .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we focus on irregular galaxies as probable relic of building blocks of galaxies .",
    "since the galaxy morphology tells us dynamical properties of galaxies , morphological classifications of galaxies provide us an important guideline in the understanding of galaxies .",
    "the most famous and pioneering work was made by hubble ( 1926 , 1936 ) : the so - called hubble classification of galaxy morphology . in his work",
    ", he stated that a few percent of galaxies do not show rotational symmetry and thus they can not be classified in his classification scheme .",
    "they are called as irregular galaxies ( irr ) .",
    "he also stated that a half of irregular galaxies including magellanic clouds constitute an important population but the remaining galaxies are peculiar ones mostly due to galaxy interaction . accordingly , irregular galaxies were recognized as heterogeneous populations ( e.g. , sandage 1961 ) .",
    "since irregular galaxies are minor populations , most studies have been devoted to the understanding of normal elliptical and spiral galaxies to date . yet , irregular galaxies are important populations if they are not related to any galaxy interaction and mergers . here",
    "we call them `` genuine irregular galaxies ( gigs ) '' in this paper .",
    "gigs are defined as isolated irregular galaxies without any regular structures ( spheroid , bulge , disk , bar , spiral arm , and nucleus ) . in particular",
    ", we remind that the absence of nucleus is an important property , already noted by hubble ( 1936 ) .",
    "it is known that almost all ordinary galaxies have a galactic nucleus , that is believed to harbor a supermassive black hole ( smbh ; kormendy & richstone 1995 ; kormendy & ho 2013 and references therein ) .",
    "the mass of smbh is observed to be well correlated to that of the spheroidal component ( bulge or spheroid ) of galaxies ( e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; kormendy & ho 2013 ) .",
    "therefore the absence of nucleus implies that the spheroidal component has not yet developed in that galaxy .",
    "it is thus suggested that irregular galaxies are still in an early evolutionary phase .",
    "this is also advocated by the presence of a plentiful amount of gas ( e.g. , roberts & hayes 1994 ; hunter & elmegreen 2004 ) . moreover , since irregular galaxies are less massive down to @xmath0 , we regard them as relics of building blocks of galaxies .    motivated by this idea , we define gigs , select a sample of gigs , and then investigate their fundamental properties for the first time in this paper . throughout this paper ,",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we adopt a flat universe with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , throughout the paper .",
    "originally , the class of irregular galaxies was defined by hubble ( 1926 ) , who investigated morphological properties of @xmath4 galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "he stated that ; _ about 3 per cent of the extra - galactic nebulae lack both dominating nuclei and rotational symmetry .",
    "these form a distinct class which can be termed `` irregular '' .",
    "the magellanic clouds are the most conspicuous examples_. this definition is our guideline and , indeed , is the same as that of the gigs discussed in this paper .",
    "the reason why we use the new term , gig , is to exclude any contamination from the so - called peculiar galaxies mostly made by galaxy interactions and mergers ( hubble 1936 ) .",
    "such contamination also includes active galaxies with a superwind activity ( e.g. , m82 ) and jets from an active galactic nucleus ( e.g. , m87 ) .    to avoid any contamination",
    ", we re - define the class of gigs as isolated galaxies without any regular structure . here",
    ", the term of `` isolated '' means that there is no neighboring galaxy and there is no firm evidence for a recent galaxy merger .",
    "note that the majority of ultraluminous infrared galaxies such as arp 220 look isolated galaxies but they are major - merger remnants ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .      in order to obtain a well - defined sample of gigs , we need reliable imaging survey for a large number of galaxies",
    ". we also need spectroscopic information to investigate their activity , metallicity , and physical sizes .",
    "one of the most suitable surveys for galaxies is the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "in fact , the following two excellent studies have been already made on morphological properties of galaxies :    1 .",
    "fukugita et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter f07 ) + based on the sdss data release three ( dr3 ) , they investigated 2253 galaxies with extinction - corrected @xmath5 magnitude brighter than 16  mag in the north equatorial stripe ( 230  deg@xmath6 ) .",
    "a total of 1866 galaxies also have spectroscopic information . in their analysis ,",
    "irregular galaxies are termed as i m ( i.e. , magellanic irregular ) . among the 2253 galaxies",
    ", they identified 31 i m galaxies .",
    "this provides the fraction of irregular galaxies is @xmath7 percent ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "nair & abraham ( 2010 ; hereafter na10 ) + based on the sdss data release four ( dr4 ) , they investigated 14034 galaxies with extinction - corrected @xmath9 magnitude brighter than 16  mag in all sdss fields ( 6670  deg@xmath6 ) .",
    "all of their sample galaxies have spectroscopic information and lie in the redshift range , @xmath10 . among the 14034 galaxies",
    ", they identified 35 i m galaxies .",
    "this provides the fraction of irregular galaxies is @xmath11 percent ( @xmath12 ) . note that na10 also obtained 52 sdm and 68 sm galaxies in their analysis .",
    "however , since these galaxies show evidence for spiral arms , we use only 35 i m galaxies in the later discussion .",
    "then , we obtain 66 irregular galaxies ( 31 from f07 and 35 from na10 ) in total .",
    "we list up these galaxies in tables  [ tb : listofirrsf07 ] ( f07 ) and [ tb : listofirrsna10 ] ( na10 ) , separately .",
    "these 66 galaxies are our preliminary sample of irregular galaxies .",
    "it is noted that there is no overlap of i m galaxies between f07 and na10 and the number fraction of the i m galaxies to the total galaxies is different with each other .",
    "this seems due to the following reasons .",
    "first , the data source is different between f07 ( dr3 ) and na10 ( dr4 ) .",
    "second , the survey area of f07 is restricted to the north equatorial stripe ( 230  deg@xmath6 ) , while that of na10 is all sdss fields ( 6670  deg@xmath6 ) , which includes the survey area of f07 .",
    "third , the selection band is different : @xmath13 ( f07 ) and @xmath14 ( na10 ) .",
    "fourth , na10 uses a spectroscopic catalog and adopts the redshift criterion , @xmath15 , while f07 uses a photometric catalog which includes the galaxies without spectroscopic information .",
    "much attention has been paid to dwarf irregular galaxies and very faint irregular galaxies because they can be more probable fossils of building blocks of galaxies ( e.g. , hunter et al . 2012 ; brown et al . 2013 ) .",
    "however , we do not take absolute magnitudes into account in our sample selection because our main aim is to identify gigs regardless of their luminosity .      in order to identify unambiguous gigs from the preliminary sample of 66 irregular galaxies , we examine their optical images carefully by using the sdss data release ten ( dr10 ) database .",
    "here we use the eye - inspection method .",
    "all the authors have examined individual galaxies and then have re - classified the preliminary sample into the following classes :    1 .",
    "elliptical - like galaxies : + no object is found .",
    "disk - like galaxies : 1 .   the presence of bulge with both spiral arms and a bar : + no object is found .",
    "the presence of bulge with spiral arms and without bar : + four objects are found .",
    "their color montages constructed by assigning rgb colors @xmath9 , @xmath5 , @xmath16 data channels are shown in figure  [ fig : disk+bulge+arm - bar ] .",
    "3 .   the presence of bulge without spiral arms and with a bar : + no object is found .",
    "the absence of bulge with both spiral arms and a bar : + one object is found .",
    "its image is shown in figure  [ fig : disk - bulge+arm+bar ] .",
    "the presence of bulge without both spiral arms and a bar : + six objects are found .",
    "their images are shown in figure  [ fig : disk+bulge - arm - bar ] .",
    "the absence of bulge with spiral arms and without a bar : + no object is found .",
    "7 .   the absence of bulge without spiral arms and with a bar : + no object is found .",
    "the presence of a partner : + eight objects are found .",
    "their images are shown in figure  [ fig : interacting ] .",
    "all these galaxies appear to be interacting galaxies .",
    "comments on the individual galaxies are given in appendix  [ sec : appa ] .",
    "merger remnants : + fourteen objects are found .",
    "their images are shown in figure  [ fig : merging ] .",
    "all these galaxies appear to be merging galaxies .",
    "comments on the individual galaxies are also given in appendix  [ sec : appa ] .",
    "gigs : + thirty three objects are found .",
    "their images are shown in figure  [ fig : gigs ] .",
    "+ although four objects ( f07 - 22 , f07 - 23 , na10 - 23 , and na10 - 29 ) seem to have companion in their images , they can be regarded as isolated as described in appendix  [ sec : appb ] .",
    "we find that only 33 galaxies out of the 66 preliminary samples of irregular galaxies are re - classified into the unambiguous gigs ( 22 from f07 and 11 from na10 ) .",
    "the remaining 33 galaxies are not gigs ( hereafter , non - gigs ) .",
    "the sub - classes of the non - gigs re - classified into ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) above are dubbed as non - gig / e , non - gig /",
    "sp , non - gig / i , and non - gig / m , respectively . in table",
    "[ tb : listofnongigs ] , we summarize the statistics of the non - gigs .",
    "the redshifts are available for 28 gigs ( 17 from f07 and 11 from na10 ) among the 33 gigs .",
    "the redshift information on f07-gigs is taken from the sdss dr10 database .",
    "however , it is noted that the redshift of one of the gigs , f07 - 25 , is given as 0.8124 , which is extremely higher than the redshifts of the other f07-gigs with spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath170.027)-band magnitude @xmath18 and size @xmath19 would be estimated as @xmath20 and @xmath21  kpc , respectively . ] . since its spectrum appears to be very noisy , we do not include this object in later discussion .",
    "therefore our final spectroscopic sample consists of 27 gigs ( 16 from f07 and 11 from na10 ) ; hereafter we call them as zgigs .",
    "we summarize the observational and physical information of the 33 gigs including 27 zgigs in table  [ tb : listofgig ] .",
    "we find that only a half of the preliminary samples of irregular galaxies are identified as unambiguous gigs . among the 33 non - gigs ,",
    "33 percent ( @xmath22 ) is re - classified into the disk - like galaxies ( non - gig / sp ) while the remaining 67 percent ( @xmath23 ) is either interacting or merging galaxies ( non - gig / i@xmath24 m ) .",
    "it is unclear whether or not there are any intrinsic differences between the non - gigs and the gigs . in order to answer the question ,",
    "here we show comparisons of the @xmath9-band absolute magnitudes @xmath18 and surface brightnesses @xmath25 of the non - gigs with redshift information ( 31 out of 33 non - gigs ) and the zgigs .",
    "the zgigs are fainter than the non - gigs as clearly shown in the right - hand side cumulative histograms in the main panels of figure  [ fig : mg+z ] .",
    "we also find that there is no gigs with @xmath26 in both of f07 and na10 samples . among",
    "the very faint galaxies with @xmath27 , which are available only in the f07 samples and @xmath28 adopted in na10 exclude these faint galaxies as shown in figure  [ fig : mg+z ] . ] , all galaxies except for a non - gig , f07 - 30 , are the zgigs . are these differences intrinsic one or merely a consequence of a kind of selection effect ?    as shown in figure  [ fig : mu_g+z ] , the cumulative histograms of @xmath25 for the na10-zgigs and non - gigs are similar with each other .",
    "almost half of the f07-zgigs ( @xmath29 ) have @xmath30 , which is similar to the non - gigs .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that these zgigs are bright enough to find any signatures of the presence of spiral arm , bar , and/or interaction / merger if exist . on the contrary ,",
    "the remaining half of the f07-zgigs ( @xmath31 ) is fainter than @xmath32 , which is comparable to that of the low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ; e.g. , impey et al .",
    "1996 ) , although the gigs do not have disk by definition .",
    "hence , for these faint-@xmath25 zgigs ( from the faintest in @xmath25 , f07 - 17 , f07 - 21 , f07 - 31 , f07 - 9 , f07 - 22 , f07 - 19 , and f07 - 20 ) , it should be reminded there remains a possibility that they have signatures of spiral arm , bar , and/or interaction / merger .    including the gigs without zgigs , about 30 percent ( @xmath33 ) are so faint in @xmath9-band surface magnitude ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) that we might miss any signatures of regular structure and/or interaction / merger .",
    "nevertheless , the remaining 70% of the gigs ( @xmath35 ) are sufficiently bright in @xmath25 and hence they are regarded as unambiguous gigs .",
    "in the previous section , we have newly defined the morphological class of gigs as isolated galaxies without any regular structures .",
    "then we selected a sample of 33 gigs based on the two papers on the morphological classification of galaxies by using the sdss data . among the 33 gigs ,",
    "27 have reliable redshift information , which are dubbed as zgigs .    in this section",
    ", we investigate observational properties of the 27 zgigs through comparisons with normal galaxies . as a control sample of normal galaxies that includes elliptical ( e ) , s0 , and spiral ( sp ) galaxies",
    ", we use the sdss galaxies studied by na10 because all their galaxies have spectroscopic information and the sample number is significantly larger than that of f07 .",
    "the total numbers of e / s0 and sp galaxies are 5938 and 7708 , respectively .    all the rest - frame photometric data for the na10 galaxies are taken from table  1 in na10 .",
    "the rest - frame photometry for f07 galaxies with redshift information is estimated by using the sdss dr10 data with the @xmath36-correction following the procedure shown in chilingarian & zolotukhin ( 2012 ) .",
    "note also that all the photometric data are corrected for the galactic extinction .",
    "we compare the number densities of the zgigs to the control sample of normal galaxies and non - gigs in order to examine whether or not the small detection number of the zgigs implies intrinsically small number density .",
    "we show the luminosity functions ( lf ) of gigs together with those of e / s0 , sp , and non - gigs in figure  [ fig : mglf ] . the lfs are estimated by the so - called @xmath37 method ( schmidt 1968 ) .",
    "note , however , that the correction for the completeness is not made .",
    "the results are shown for the f07 and na10 samples separately in figure  [ fig : mglf ] . in this figure ,",
    "the results are shown for the f07 and na10 samples , separately .",
    "first , we find that the lfs of gigs show power - law like lfs for both the f07 and na10 samples .",
    "second , we find that the gigs are the dominant population in fainter galaxies at @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction of gigs is negligible ( @xmath39 ) at @xmath40 .",
    "we compare the physical size of zgigs as a function of @xmath18 with those of normal galaxies and the non - gigs . here",
    ", we use the petrosian radius , @xmath19 , as a size of galaxy .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : rp - mg ] .",
    "compared to the control samples , the sizes of the zgigs are significantly smaller",
    ". however , the @xmath41-@xmath18 relation for the gigs appears to follow the same relation for the sp sample .",
    "the sizes of na10-zgigs ( f07-zgigs without f07 - 25 at @xmath42 ) are 3.286.01  kpc ( 1.062.20  kpc ) with a median value of 3.82  kpc ( 1.68  kpc ) .",
    "we find that the f07-zgigs are systematically smaller than the na10-zgigs .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the f07-zgigs are located at lower redshifts than the redshift threshold adopted in na10 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we compare the rest - frame optical color , @xmath44 , of zgigs with those of normal galaxies as a function of @xmath18 in figure  [ fig : cmr ] .",
    "the zgigs tend to be bluer than normal spiral galaxies on average and all the zgigs are bluer than @xmath45 .",
    "if the bluer color of zgigs is attributed to recent massive star formation events , their star formation rate relative to the stellar mass ( i.e. , the specific star formation rate ) is systematically higher than those of normal spiral galaxies ( see section  [ subsec : ionsource ] ) .",
    "we compare the stellar mass density , @xmath46 , of the zgigs with normal galaxies as a function of @xmath18 in figure  [ fig : mum - mg ] .",
    "the catalog of na10 includes stellar mass estimated by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) . for zgigs in f07",
    ", we use the stellar mass in the same catalog .",
    "the gigs tend to have lower stellar mass density compared to the sp sample systematically .",
    "this suggests that the cumulative star formation rate in the gigs is smaller than that of typical spiral galaxies .",
    "all the 27 zgigs show strong optical emission lines . in order to study major ionization sources in them",
    ", we use the so called excitation diagram between @xmath47\\lambda 6584 / \\mathrm{h}\\alpha$ ] and @xmath48\\lambda 5007 / \\mathrm{h}\\beta$ ] emission line ratios ( e.g. , baldwin , phillips , & terlevich 1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "since the gigs have no nucleus by definition , there is no contribution from active galactic nuclei .",
    "it is therefore expected that most probable ionization sources are massive ob stars .",
    "in fact , we find that all the zgigs show @xmath49-region like properties in figure  [ fig : bpt ] . here , the emission line flux data are taken from the sdss dr10 datebase .",
    "note that the two gigs , f07 - 7 ( sdss  j@xmath50 ) and f07 - 22 ( sdss  j@xmath51 ) , show strong h@xmath52 absorption .",
    "since this makes difficult to estimate their h@xmath52 emission , we show these data points as upper limits in figure  [ fig : bpt ] .",
    "we then conclude that the major ionization sources in the zgigs are massive ob stars .",
    "if the superwind activity works effectively , ionization would be dominated by shock heating .",
    "if this is the case , the zgigs would be located around @xmath47\\lambda 6584 / \\mathrm{h}\\alpha \\sim 0 $ ] ( e.g. , veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that the superwind activity is fairly low in the zgigs .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that the majority of zgigs are located in a domain with both @xmath47\\lambda 6584 / \\mathrm{h}\\alpha < -1 $ ] and @xmath48\\lambda 5007 / \\mathrm{h}\\beta > 0 $ ] in figure  [ fig : bpt ] .",
    "this implies that the zgigs are metal poor galaxies ( e.g. , kewley et al .",
    "in fact , typical nuclear starburst galaxies are located in a domain with both @xmath47\\lambda 6584 / \\mathrm{h}\\alpha \\sim -0.5 $ ] and @xmath48\\lambda 5007 / \\mathrm{h}\\beta < 0.5 $ ] ( balzano 1983 ; ho et al .",
    "1997 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "based on the theoretical study by kewley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , it is suggested that the gas metallicity of zgigs range from 0.5 @xmath53 to 1 @xmath53 ( see next section ) .",
    "optical emission - line ratios are also used to estimate the gas metallicity of galaxies ( e.g. , kewley & ellison 2008 and references therein ) . in the estimate of gas metallicity",
    ", the so - called @xmath54 parameter has been often used : @xmath55\\lambda 3727 + [ \\mbox{\\ion{o}{3 } } ] \\lambda 4959 , 5007 ) / \\mathrm{h}\\beta$ ] . however , the @xmath56 \\lambda 3727 $ ] is outside of the sdss spectral coverage for most nearby galaxies . since it has been shown that the @xmath57 parameter , @xmath58 \\lambda 6584 / \\mathrm{h}\\alpha)}$ ] , also works well for the estimate of gas metallicity ( e.g. , denicol et al .",
    "2002 ; pettini & pagel 2004 ) , we use the @xmath57 parameter in our analysis .",
    "we use the following @xmath57 calibration formula obtained by pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) :    @xmath59    the gas metallicity obtained from this formula is given in the last column of table 3 .",
    "the gas metallicity ranges from 8.08 to 8.81 with the median value of 8.31 .",
    "here we note that the gas metallicity of f07 - 21 , 8.81 , appears to be unusually high for its absolute magnitude , @xmath60 .",
    "since its optical spectrum shows very strong h@xmath52 absorption , the h@xmath61 emission flux could be underestimated significantly . in order to estimate its gas metallicity unambiguously , we need new detailed optical spectroscopy for this object .",
    "it is also encouraged to use other metallicity indicators , such as @xmath54 , for future investigations because there is a possible systematic difference of the estimated gas metallicity from @xmath54 and @xmath57 parameters , @xmath62  dex ( e.g. , cullen et al . 2013 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mmr ] , we show the gas metallicity to the absolute @xmath9-band magnitude relation between the zgig and the star - forming galaxies in the na10 catalog . the metallicities of both samples are evaluated from @xmath57 parameter . for the star - forming galaxies in na10",
    ", we use galaxies in which both h@xmath61 and @xmath47 \\lambda 6584 $ ] are detected in high significance ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "we also show the contours that enclose 68% and 95% of the star - forming galaxies as solid lines and dashed lines .",
    "all zgigs but f07 - 21 appear to be systematically metal poorer than the star - forming galaxies in na10 .",
    "it is also noted that the gas metallicity of our zgigs is lower than the solar metallicity , @xmath64 ( asplund et al .",
    "2005 ) , if we exclude f07 - 21 .",
    "in this paper , we have defined the class of genuine irregular galaxies ( gigs ) and selected a sample of 33 gigs from literature .",
    "this sample is not a complete one in any sense .",
    "our main purpose is to unambiguously pick up irregular galaxies originally defined by hubble ( 1926 ) .",
    "as noted by hubble ( 1936 ) , a half of irregular galaxies are contaminations from interacting / merging galaxies and starburst galaxies and galaxies with an agn .",
    "in fact , our analysis shows that 33 irregular galaxies among the 66 ones are not genuine irregular galaxies .",
    "it is thus suggested that @xmath65 percent of irregular galaxies in previous statistical studies on galaxy morphology are not gigs and thus statistical properties of irregular galaxies are affected by this selection bias .    more importantly ,",
    "if we have a reliable sample of gigs in the nearby universe , we are able to examine their observational properties and then obtain some observational clues in the understanding of building blocks of galaxies .",
    "in fact , our gigs have smaller physical sizes and absolute luminosities than those of normal galaxies . also , they have no evidence for the bulge component .",
    "this suggests that an smbh is not present even now since we can not find their galactic nucleus .",
    "furthermore , since the gigs have lower metallicity than that of normal galaxies , they are in younger stages in the context of chemical evolution of galaxies .    in conclusion , it is important to make systematic studies of gigs , providing us what happened in the early evolution of galaxies at high redshift universe .",
    "our future plans are the followings .",
    "( 1 ) we will make our own systematic surveys of gigs using archival imaging data obtained with the suprime - cam on the 8.2  m subaru telescope .",

    "taniguchi et al . 2007 ) . ( 2 ) in this paper , we have realized that eye - ball classification of galaxy morphology is basically a hard business .",

    "<S> in order to understand nature of building blocks of galaxies in the early universe , we investigate `` genuine irregular galaxies ( gigs ) '' in the nearby universe . here , gigs are defined as isolated galaxies without regular structures ( spheroid , bulge , disk , bar , spiral arm , and nucleus ) . using the results of two excellent studies on galaxy morphology based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , we obtain a sample of 66 irregular galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out new classification of them into gigs and non - gigs which have regular structure or show evidence for galaxy interaction , by using the sdss data release 10 images . </S>",
    "<S> we then find that a half of these irregular galaxies ( 33/66 ) are gigs and obtain an unambiguous sample of 33 gigs for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss their observational properties by comparing them with those of elliptical , s0 , spiral galaxies , and irregular galaxies without the gigs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our gigs have smaller sizes , lower optical luminosities , bluer rest - frame optical colors , lower surface stellar mass densities , and lower gas metallicity than normal galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> all these properties suggest that they are in chemically and dynamically younger phases even in the nearby universe . </S>"
