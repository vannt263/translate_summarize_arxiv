    "cusp forms are the building blocks of the modern theory of automorphic forms .",
    "they are elusive objects and even the existence of the everywhere unramified forms on @xmath2 @xmath3 that we study in this paper , is known only by indirect means ( selberg 1956 using the trace formula ) . the first reliable numerical computations of such forms was carried out by hejhal and rackner @xcite .",
    "they computed some high frequency maass cusp forms ( both even and odd ) for @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the modular surface .",
    "it has an orientation reversing isometry @xmath6 induced from the reflection of @xmath7 , given by @xmath8 .    the even maass cusp forms ( which will be the central objects in this paper ) are functions @xmath9 satisfying    * @xmath10 , @xmath11 , * @xmath12 , * @xmath13 , * @xmath14 , normalized so that @xmath15 ,    where @xmath16 is the hyperbolic area measure . such a @xmath17 is automatically a cusp form @xcite and we will assume that it is also an eigenfunction of all the hecke operators @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding automorphic cusp forms on @xmath20 are the everywhere unramified forms and their @xmath21-functions @xmath22 are the @xmath23 analogues of the riemann zeta function .",
    "we will use the parameter @xmath24 to parametrize the eigenvalue by @xmath25 and we let @xmath26 be the numbering of such @xmath17 s when ordered by @xmath27 .",
    "selberg @xcite proved a weyl law for these @xmath17 s ( thus demonstrating their existence ) ; @xmath28    let @xmath29 denote the nodal line of @xmath17 , that is the set @xmath30 .",
    "it consists of a finite union of real analytic curves .",
    "the connected components of @xmath31 are the nodal domains of @xmath17 and we denote their number by @xmath32 . more generally , for any subset @xmath33 we denote by @xmath34 the number of such domains that meet @xmath35 . from @xcite",
    "we have in figure 1 , a picture of the nodal lines for four such @xmath17 s with @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( note that @xmath24 is denoted by @xmath38 in @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with answering some questions that have been raised in connection with such pictures .",
    "the most basic is to determine the number of nodal domains , either in totality or in subsets of a fundamental domain .",
    "another question , which appears particularly hard to address analytically , is whether @xmath39 is nonsingular ( and hence is self - avoiding ) . using heuristic arguments relating the zero sets of random waves to an exactly solvable bond percolation model , as well as further heuristics relating eigenfunctions of quantizations of chaotic hamiltonians to random waves , bogomolny and schmit @xcite",
    "suggest that in such settings @xmath32 has an asymptotic law ! in our setting of even maass cusp forms for @xmath40 , it reads + * bogomolny - schmit conjecture * @xmath41    there is also a localized version for @xmath34 for @xmath35 a subset of @xmath40 like the windows in figure 1 and the prediction is remarkably accurate for these four forms .",
    "based on this and other experimentation in different settings ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) it seems that this prediction is probably correct , with either the above constant or one very close to it .    according to courant s general nodal domain theorem @xcite and , one has asymptotically @xmath42",
    "however , even showing that @xmath32 ( or more generally @xmath34 with @xmath35 a compact piece of @xmath40 ) goes to infinity with @xmath26 is problematic . at issue",
    "is the fact that @xmath32 is a global topological invariant and hence is difficult to study from local considerations . in particular , it is not true for a general riemannian surface that @xmath32 must increase with @xmath26 , so that the problem is truly a global one ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite where it is shown that there are infinite sequences of eigenfunctions each with few nodal domains ) .",
    "our main result is a conditional proof ( assuming something much weaker then a generalized riemann hypothesis ) that @xmath43 goes to infinity with @xmath26 .",
    "we turn to a precise formulation of our results and methods .",
    "the isometry @xmath6 of @xmath40 maps the nodal domains of @xmath17 bijectively to themselves . in this way",
    ", the nodal domains are partitioned into those fixed by @xmath6 , which we call _ inert _ , and those paired off by @xmath6 which we call _ split _ ( see figure 2 from @xcite , where the black and red ones are inert and the green ones are split ) . correspondingly we write @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of inert domains and @xmath46 , which is even , is the number of split domains .",
    "the nodal domains for @xmath17 that we will produce are all inert . according to the estimates given below ,",
    "if the bogomolny - schmit conjecture is true , then most of the nodal domains for @xmath17 are split ( when @xmath47 ) ; however we have no proof that there are any split nodal domains !",
    "our analysis is based on intersecting @xmath39 with various analytic arcs in @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath48 is such a simple arc then clearly @xmath49        denote by @xmath50 the number of sign changes of @xmath17 when traversing @xmath48 .",
    "a key role is played by the arc @xmath51 which is fixed by @xmath6 .",
    "this arc is composed of three piecewise analytic geodesics , denoted by @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 in figure 3 . a simple topological analysis ( see section 2.1 ) shows that @xmath55 and more generally for @xmath48 a nonempty segment of @xmath56 @xmath57 the complexification technique of toth and zelditch ( using a form of jensen s lemma ) may be applied to our @xmath17 s whose normal derivative vanishes along @xmath56 , to yield latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : oh8 }    inert nodal domains is much smaller than what is predicted by the bogomolny - schmit conjecture . to give a lower bound for @xmath45 we will use and and",
    "hence we seek sign changes in @xmath59 along a given curve . to this end",
    ", we examine the behavior of @xmath59 when restricted to certain curves .",
    "these restriction questions were first examined in @xcite and @xcite , and sharp versions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath60 be a nonempty simple analytic segment .",
    "we seek sharp upper and lower bounds for the @xmath61-restrictions of @xmath59 .",
    "it is plausible that for any such fixed @xmath48 and large @xmath24 ( recall that @xmath17 will always be @xmath61 normalized over @xmath40 ) @xmath62 where throughout the paper @xmath63 denotes the hyperbolic arclength measure @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "clearly , this implies that @xmath48 is not part of the nodal line @xmath39 for @xmath24 large enough , which itself is a very strong statement .",
    "if @xmath48 is a geodesic or horocycle segment , then one can show without difficulty that @xmath48 is not a part of @xmath39 ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "if @xmath48 is a closed horocycle or a long enough ( compact ) subsegment of @xmath56 , we establish the sharp bounds in  .",
    "one of the key ingredients in the proof of the lower bound is the quantum unique ergodicity ( que ) theorem of lindenstrauss @xcite and soundararajan @xcite .",
    "it asserts that the restriction of @xmath66 to a nice @xmath67 ( say a geodesic ball or more generally micro local lifts to @xmath68 ) satisfies @xmath69    [ theoremi1 ] let @xmath70 be a closed horocycle in @xmath40 .",
    "then , for @xmath71 @xmath72    using probabilistic arguments , hejhal and rackner ( @xcite ( 6.12 ) ) conjecture that the restricted mean square of @xmath17 to a closed horocycle is asymptotic to @xmath73 .",
    "this follows from the conjectured equation in appendix a.    [ theoremi2 ] if @xmath48 is a long enough but fixed compact subsegment in @xmath52 or @xmath53 , then for @xmath74 @xmath75    in section 6 ( see theorem [ theorem5.1 ] ) we first prove the lower bound in theorem [ theoremi2 ] in non - localised form , namely the inequality between the first and third terms in this theorem . for this ,",
    "little of the arithmetic features of @xmath40 ( other than que ) are used .",
    "the localized version is technically much more involved , requiring a delicate asymptotic analysis of the off - diagonal terms , with both arithmetic and analytic input being crucial .",
    "it is in this analysis that we are forced to make @xmath48 long ( see section 6.2 and appendix a ) .",
    "the sharp lower bounds in the restriction theorems above can be combined with strong upper bounds for  @xmath76  for @xmath77 an arbitrary segment of @xmath70 or @xmath48 , and subconvexity bounds for @xmath78 on @xmath40 ( see @xcite ) to give lower bounds for @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( see the end of section 5 and section 6.3 ) .",
    "[ theoremi4 ] let @xmath81 be a fixed closed horocycle in @xmath40 .",
    "then for @xmath71 @xmath82    the upper bound above can be established without recourse to arithmetic , that is it holds for any hyperbolic surface @xmath83 and any closed horocycle on @xmath83 , as was shown recently by jung @xcite .",
    "the lower bound can be improved to @xmath84 if one were to assume that the @xmath85-norm of @xmath17 restricted to compact sets is bounded by @xmath86 .",
    "the random wave model for the @xmath17 s predicts that  @xmath87  as  @xmath88  ( see appendix b ) .",
    "our primary interest is in sign changes of @xmath17 along @xmath56 .",
    "the lower bound in the next theorem is conditional on the lindelof hypothesis for the @xmath21-functions @xmath22 associated to the form @xmath17 .",
    "this conjecture asserts that @xmath89 and its truth follows from the corresponding riemann hypothesis . for our purpose , what we need is a bound of the form @xmath90 for some finite @xmath91 but with @xmath92 .",
    "the best subconvex bounds for @xmath22 known give @xmath93 ( see @xcite,@xcite ) which is far short of @xmath94 .",
    "for this reason we simply assume the full lindelof hypothesis .",
    "[ theoremi5 ] fix @xmath95 a sufficiently long compact geodesic segment on @xmath52 or @xmath53 and assume the lindelof hypothesis for the @xmath21-functions @xmath22",
    ". then @xmath96    as noted in  , general complexification techniques @xcite yield @xmath97 .",
    "theorem [ theoremi5 ] together with leads to our main result .",
    "[ theoremi6 ] with the same assumptions as in theorem [ theoremi5 ] @xmath98 and in particular that @xmath99 goes to infinity as @xmath26 goes to infinity .",
    "finally , we examine the behavior of @xmath17 in the shrinking regions near the cusp of @xmath40 . for @xmath100 in the standard fundamental domain for @xmath101 , and when @xmath102 ,  @xmath17 is approximated very well by one term in its fourier expansion . from this",
    ", one can execute a much finer analysis of @xmath39 even into a slightly larger region away from the cusp .",
    "it appears that all the nodal domains in these regions are inert domains , see section 4 ( this being the analogue of the suggestion in @xcite that all the zeros of a holomorphic hecke eigenform of weight @xmath103 in the region of the standard fundamental domain with @xmath104 are real , that is they lie on the boundary @xmath56 ) . in any case , we show that there are at least @xmath105 inert domains in the region @xmath106 . in particular , @xmath107 other finer aspects of the geometry and topology of @xmath39 near the cusp ( here @xmath108 with @xmath109 any positive constant ) are discussed in section 4 .",
    "our results concerning these even maass cusp forms can be extended to the eisenstein series @xmath110 and to odd cusp forms on @xmath40 .",
    "the eisenstein series are even with respect to the symmetry @xmath6 and other than renormalizing the @xmath61-norms by restricting to a compact subset of @xmath40 and invoking ( @xcite , @xcite ) the proofs go through in the same way .",
    "the odd forms vanish identically on @xmath56 and the analysis of the nodal domains proceeds by working with the normal derivative of @xmath17 restricted to @xmath56 .",
    "the analogue @xmath0-restriction lower bounds and @xmath85 upper bounds can be established with small modifications as indicated in appendix c. in particular , one concludes that theorem [ theoremi6 ] is valid for the odd cusp forms as well .",
    "one can also extend these results on nodal domains to congruence subgroups as long as they carry reflection symmetries .",
    "for example if @xmath111 is a surface of genus @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the usual ` hecke ' congruence group , then our reflection @xmath114 induces an isometry @xmath115 of @xmath83 .",
    "the fixed set of @xmath115 consists of a finite union of geodesics running between cusps .",
    "we can diagonalize the space of newforms ( the oldforms being taken care of at a lower level ) with respect to @xmath115 , yielding @xmath115-even and @xmath115-odd forms @xmath17 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath17 has @xmath115 inert and split nodal domains . the main result , theorem [ theoremi6 ] , extends to this setting , namely if @xmath83 is fixed ( as is @xmath112 ) and @xmath17 is as above , then the lower bound in theorem [ theoremi6 ] for the number of inert nodal domains for @xmath17 holds as @xmath88 ( see the remark after theorem [ theoremnodal ] ) . in particular , the number of nodal domains for @xmath17 goes to infinity with @xmath24 .    the techniques used to prove our main results rely heavily on the fourier expansion of @xmath17 and especially the arithmetic interpretation of its fourier coefficients , so that it is not clear if the results extend to compact arithmetic surfaces @xmath83 . in a follow - up paper @xcite",
    "we show that indeed similar results hold for nodal domains of eigenfunctions on certain such @xmath83 s .",
    "again , the key is that @xmath83 carry a reflection symmetry . to produce such arithmetic surfaces with a symmetry",
    "we take @xmath83 to be @xmath116 , where @xmath101 corresponds to the unit group of an anisotropic rational quadratic form @xmath117 of signature @xmath118 . to ensure that @xmath83 has a reflective symmetry @xmath115 , one requires that there be an integral root vector of @xmath119 of length @xmath120 (",
    "the sign is such that this gives a hyperbolic reflection ) . in this compact setting the proof of the critical theorem [ theoremi2 ] for @xmath115 even eigenfunctions as well as various of the other ingredients , are deduced using more representation theoretical tools .",

    "let @xmath5 be the modular surface and @xmath122 be the isometry of @xmath40 ( as a hyperbolic surface ) induced by the reflection of @xmath7 given by @xmath123 in what follows , @xmath124 will be an even hecke - maass cusp form , so that @xmath125 let @xmath56 be the set of points on @xmath40 fixed by @xmath6 so that @xmath126 as shown below ( here we take the standard fundamental domain @xmath127 ) .",
    "the nodal line of @xmath17 is the set @xmath128 while the nodal domains of @xmath17 are the ( finitely many ) connected components of @xmath31 .",
    "we denote them by @xmath129 where @xmath130 is their number . from , it is clear that if @xmath131 is a nodal domain ( of @xmath17 ) then so is @xmath132 .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath133 s are disjoint , they fall into two types :    * inert domains @xmath134 where @xmath135 for some @xmath136 and @xmath137 ; * split domains @xmath138 , @xmath139 where @xmath140 for some @xmath136 + and @xmath141 .    thus the list of @xmath131 s is @xmath142 so that @xmath143    geometrically , we can recognize the two types of nodal domains according as @xmath144 is empty or not .",
    "if @xmath144 is nonempty , then it is an open nonempty subset of @xmath56 , so that the invariance of @xmath56 under @xmath6 ensures that @xmath145 is nonempty and so @xmath146 . if on the other hand @xmath144 is empty , then being open and connected , @xmath133 lies entirely in @xmath147 or @xmath148 as indicated in figure 1 , so that @xmath133 does not meet @xmath149 since @xmath150 .",
    "thus , inert domains are exactly the domains meeting @xmath56 and can be thought of as boundary nodal domains for @xmath148 .",
    "they are the analogues of what are called real zeros for holomorphic forms in @xcite .",
    "topologically , @xmath56 is a circle when compactified at the cusp @xmath151 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath17 at the cusp and the normalization of the first fourier coefficient ( see section 3 ) ensures that @xmath17 ( restricted to @xmath56 ) is positive in a neighborhood of @xmath151 .",
    "let @xmath152 with @xmath153 , denote the zeros of @xmath17 arranged cyclically on @xmath56 . denote by @xmath154 the subset @xmath155 of the @xmath156 s at which @xmath17 changes sign .",
    "clearly @xmath157 is even and @xmath158 ( since @xmath159 ) .",
    "we call @xmath160 the number of zeros of @xmath17 on @xmath56 and @xmath26 the number of sign changes .    each inert nodal domain @xmath161 meets @xmath162 and the intersection consists of a disjoint set of segments of the form @xmath163 .",
    "moreover , different inert domains give rise to different disjoint sets of such segments .",
    "it follows that the number of inert @xmath161 s is at most the number of intervals @xmath163 so that we have the upper bound @xmath164 .    to obtain a lower bound for @xmath165",
    ", we first assume that the nodal line @xmath39 is nonsingular ( that is @xmath17 and @xmath166 never vanish together ) so that @xmath167 . in this case",
    ", @xmath39 has no self - crossings and consists of say @xmath168 simple closed curves @xmath169 , ... , @xmath170 (",
    "each an embedded circle in @xmath171 .",
    "if @xmath172 , then @xmath173 passes through @xmath174 for some @xmath175 and being an embedded circle must cross @xmath56 at some other point @xmath176 .",
    "the resulting reflected curve ( by @xmath6 ) yields a closed curve in @xmath40 which is one of the components of @xmath39 and which we denote by @xmath177 .",
    "these curves meet @xmath56 at exactly two distinct points and every point of @xmath154 appears once .",
    "thus we get exactly @xmath178 simple closed curves in @xmath40 corresponding to the sign changes of @xmath17 on @xmath56 .",
    "the remaining @xmath179 closed curves come in pairs and do not meet @xmath56 .",
    "it follows from this , by induction on @xmath168 and @xmath180 , that there are exactly @xmath181 nodal domains whose boundary contains one of the @xmath177 s . in other words , under the nonsingular assumption , there are @xmath181 inert domains and @xmath182 split domains .    in general , @xmath39 consists of piecewise analytic arcs with singularities formed by crossings ( cusps ) and self - intersections .",
    "however these may be removed locally one at a time at the cost of possibly decreasing the number of inert nodal domains but not changing @xmath154 or at worst not increasing the quantity @xmath183 . in more detail , suppose that locally ( away from @xmath56 ) , @xmath39 looks like the figure on the left below with @xmath184 denoting the sign of @xmath17 near the singularity and @xmath185 the corresponding pieces of the complement .        deforming the curves near the singularity ( as shown in the figure on the right above ) would possibly decrease the number of connected components by one and keeps everything away from the singularity the same .",
    "if the singularity looks like that below , with @xmath186 and @xmath187 joined as shown , then we remove the arc joining them which may again decrease the number of domains without changing anything else .        next , consider the figure on the left below where @xmath39 meets the boundary @xmath56 . here ,",
    "@xmath186 and @xmath187 are sign changes of @xmath17 on @xmath56 . to get the figure on the right , we deform the arcs containing @xmath186 and @xmath187 into each other so that @xmath186 and @xmath187 are replaced by the point @xmath188 which is not a sign change . here",
    "we reduce the value of @xmath26 by two and lose exactly one inert nodal domain , so that @xmath189 is unchanged and the singularity @xmath190 is removed .",
    "last , we consider the case when one encounters a possible cusp singularity on the boundary as shown below . here , there are two possible deformations .",
    "suppose that @xmath17 is positive on @xmath191 and @xmath192 , and negative on @xmath193 .",
    "then , we may remove the singularity @xmath190 which is not a sign change , as shown in the middle figure . in this way",
    ", the number of inert nodal domains may have possibly decreased while the number of sign changes remains unchanged .",
    "the same conclusion holds if @xmath17 is positive on @xmath191 and @xmath193 , and negative on @xmath192 .",
    "now we may remove the arc between @xmath191 and @xmath193 as shown on the right .        in this way",
    ", we remove all crossings and singularities so that when completed , @xmath39 will be a nonsingular curve and the quantity @xmath183 will not have increased .",
    "we then have the following    [ theoremnodal ] let @xmath165 denote the number of inert nodal domains of @xmath17 .",
    "suppose @xmath160 denotes the number of zeros of @xmath17 on @xmath56 , and @xmath26 the number of sign changes .",
    "then @xmath194 if @xmath39 is nonsingular , then there are exactly @xmath195 inert nodal domains of @xmath17 .",
    "an analog of this lower bound also holds for other arithmetic surfaces as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "however , one must take into account the genus @xmath112 of the surface .",
    "then , the lower bound takes the shape @xmath196 so that for a fixed surface , @xmath197 .",
    "we end this section by showing that the restriction of @xmath17 to a geodesic segment or a horocycle segment can not be identically zero .",
    "that is to say that @xmath39 can not contain a geodesic segment or a horocycle segment .",
    "we begin with a horocycle segment @xmath198 . if @xmath199 then by analytic continuation @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the complete horocycle extending @xmath81 .",
    "it is well known @xcite from the theory of the horocycle flow , that the projection of @xmath202 in @xmath40 is either a closed horocycle or it is dense in @xmath40 . in case of the latter , clearly @xmath203 in @xmath40 , which is a contradiction . on the other hand , if the projection of @xmath202 in @xmath40 is a closed horocycle @xmath204 , then theorem [ theoremi1 ] is applicable ( see section 5 and theorem 5.1 ) so that we have an essentially sharp , and in particular a non - zero , lower bound for the @xmath61-restriction of @xmath17 to @xmath204 , which contradicts that @xmath200 .",
    "one can also use the ( exponentially small ) lower bound of @xcite which has the advantage of not making any arithmetic assumptions .",
    "however , we give an simpler argument as follows : suppose @xmath204 is the set @xmath205 with a fixed @xmath206",
    ". then for any integer @xmath207 , @xmath208 where @xmath209 are the hecke fourier coefficients and @xmath174 is the bessel - macdonald function ( see sections 3 and 5 for details and notation ) .",
    "it is known that the bessel function above does not vanish if we choose @xmath210 . moreover",
    ", the hecke relations ensures that @xmath211 for all @xmath180 chosen to be either a prime or its square .",
    "thus the @xmath61-norm above does not vanish .",
    "this completes the proof of the claim for horocyclic segments .",
    "for geodesic segments @xmath48 , assume that @xmath212 .",
    "first , if @xmath213 then along @xmath48 we have both @xmath212 and @xmath214 so that by the reflection principle ( or carleman estimates ) @xmath17 vanishes identically on @xmath40 .",
    "hence we may assume that @xmath48 is disjoint from @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath215 be the lifted complete geodesic in @xmath7 , so that again from analytic continuation @xmath216 .",
    "hence by the reflection principle , as an eigenfunction on @xmath7 , @xmath17 satisfies @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is the reflection of @xmath7 in @xmath215 .",
    "moreover , we also have @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the reflection in @xmath221 , for @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "thus , @xmath224 is invariant under the subgroup @xmath225 of the isometries of @xmath7 generated by @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "the reflection group @xmath228 is known to be a maximal discrete subgroup of the isometry group of @xmath7 . since @xmath229 (",
    "since we are assuming here that @xmath230 is not contained in @xmath56 ) , we conclude that @xmath225 is not a discrete subgroup of the isometry group of @xmath7 .",
    "hence the same is true of the subgroup of words of even length in @xmath226 and @xmath227 , as a subgroup of @xmath231 .",
    "in particular , the closure of this last group contains a 1-parameter connected subgroup of @xmath231 which we denote by @xmath232 .",
    "so @xmath233 is invariant under the action of @xmath232 on @xmath7 . by connectedness , @xmath17 is also invariant under @xmath232 so that @xmath17 is an eigenfunction that lives on @xmath234 .",
    "such an eigenfunction is a function of one variable ( satisfying an ode ) and unless it is identically zero can not be invariant under @xmath101 .",

    "we write @xmath886 for any fixed @xmath541 , which may vary with @xmath24 , we consider the vectors @xmath887 where @xmath888 denotes the unit vector with the @xmath889 in the nth- + coordinate .",
    "the probability density function for the real zeros of the the associated random wave function is given by @xmath890 where @xmath891 is the derivative with respect to @xmath469 and with the standard inner - product .",
    "this is the expected number of real zeros of the associated wave function per unit length at the point @xmath469 .",
    "unlike the situation in @xcite , we do not expect the term @xmath892 to contribute to the main term , in which case , we should have @xmath893 define , for @xmath251 @xmath894 so that with @xmath895 we have      @xmath896 for @xmath469 not close to a half - integer , we would not expect the terms above involving @xmath469 to contribute due to cancellation . using lemma [ lemmaone ]",
    ", we write the sum @xmath897 for @xmath180 s restricted by the ranges as indicated there . using corollary [ corlone ] , we see that @xmath898 is negligible . similarly , @xmath899 is bounded by @xmath900 if @xmath901 . in",
    "what follows , we will restrict @xmath541 to satisfy @xmath902 , so that @xmath903 .",
    "put @xmath904 and @xmath905 so that @xmath906    where we denote by @xmath907 any function of the type @xmath908 , with @xmath253 a constant .",
    "we show that the second sum in above is @xmath827 for all @xmath469 , while the same is true for the first sum except for those @xmath469 near integers . for @xmath909 ,",
    "the first sum is asymptotic to @xmath910 and it is easy to show it is @xmath827 if @xmath911 . to deal with the second sum , we use the following lemma from @xcite ( pg .",
    "306 ) :      for those @xmath917 , with @xmath577 sufficiently small , the sum is trivially @xmath827 . for @xmath918 , we subdivide the sum into subsums with @xmath919 with @xmath920 . for @xmath180 in such a subsum @xmath921 moreover , we may take @xmath922 so that the lemma gives an estimate for each subsum of @xmath923 simplifying and summing over @xmath432 then gives us the estimate of @xmath827 if @xmath924 , as is the case .",
    "we thus have @xmath925 except for those @xmath469 with @xmath926 . in exactly the same way and with the same restriction , @xmath927 while @xmath928 .",
    "this then gives us @xmath929 uniformly for all @xmath469 except those satisfying @xmath930 , with @xmath931 ( the last condition may probably be relaxed ) . integrating over all @xmath932 , using the estimate @xmath933 for the exceptional @xmath469 s , we obtain the expected number @xmath934 of zeros of @xmath124 on such a horocycle ( compare with theorem [ theoremthree ] and theorem [ theorematwo ] ) .      in this appendix , we sketch the proof of the remark made in the introduction regarding the nodal domains of an odd maass form",
    ". let @xmath17 be an odd , real hecke - maass eigenform , so that @xmath17 satisfies @xmath935 .",
    "hence @xmath17 vanishes identically on @xmath56 ,",
    "which is therefore part of the nodal line of @xmath17 , and so we consider the nodal domains within @xmath148 in figure 3 . to prove the analogous lower bound for the number of nodal domains for @xmath17 which meet @xmath95 ( these being the ` inert ' nodal domains ) we seek sign - changes of the normal derivative @xmath936 of @xmath17 along @xmath56 ( and consequently those of @xmath937 along @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "each point in @xmath48 at which there is such a sign - change must be the end point of an interior nodal line and a topological argument similar to the one in section 2 shows that the number of associated nodal domains is at least half of the number of such sign - changes . as before in order to produce sign changes in @xmath936 we compare its @xmath1-norm , its @xmath0-norm and also its meanvalue all restricted to @xmath48 .",
    "write @xmath941 and for any @xmath942 , put @xmath943 for fixed @xmath282 , we apply bernstein s inequality to get @xmath944 then choose @xmath945 so that @xmath946 and all its derivatives are well approximated by @xmath17 and its derivatives respectively , with an error that decays exponentially in @xmath188 so that the lemma follows .",
    "next , we need to prove @xmath947 which is the analogue of .",
    "this is obtained in exactly the same way as the discussion there , where now becomes @xmath948 then , stirling s formula together with the lindelof hypothesis gives the required result .",
    "finally , we need to prove , as in section 6.2 @xmath949 the method is the same , with the non - diagonal terms offering no new problems . however , the diagonal term can not be evaluated as in section 6.2.3 because @xmath950 is not automorphic so that the diagonal is not an inner - product involving an incomplete eisenstein series .",
    "instead we obtain a lower - bound for the diagonal using positivity , asymptotic estimates for the bessel functions and finally que by using prop .",
    "[ shortsum ] .",
    "the constant obtained this way is much smaller than that obtained for the even case , but does not affect the outcome if @xmath661 is chosen large enough .    to obtain the analogue of section 6.2.2 we could have proceeded by using the gradient of @xmath17 instead of @xmath951 as follows @xmath952 for small values of @xmath635",
    "one may rewrite the last integral , after integrating by parts , as an inner product with incomplete eisenstein and poincare series against @xmath233 , with a small error , so that que can be applied . for the large values of @xmath635",
