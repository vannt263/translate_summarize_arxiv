    "<S> lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) has been observed in neutrino oscillations . for charged lepton </S>",
    "<S> fv decays only upper limits are known , but sizable branching ratios are expected in many neutrino mass models . </S>",
    "<S> high scale models , such as the classical supersymmetric seesaw , usually predict that decays @xmath0 are roughly a factor @xmath1 maller than the corresponding decays @xmath2 . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the @xmath3-penguin diagram can give an enhancement for decays @xmath0 in many extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first discuss why the @xmath3-penguin is not dominant in the mssm with seesaw and show that much larger contributions from the @xmath3-penguin are expected in general . </S>",
    "<S> we then demonstrate the effect numerically in two example models , namely , the supersymmetric inverse seesaw and r - parity violating supersymmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction : _ neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite have firmly established that lepton flavor is violated in the neutrino sector , with two of the three measurable mixing angles being surprisingly large . </S>",
    "<S> observation of the characteristic `` neutrino dip '' leaves no doubt that neutrinos have mass @xcite and quite accurate values for the mass squared differences are known now @xcite . in the charged lepton sector , however , only upper limits on lfv branching ratios , such as @xmath4 @xcite or @xmath5 @xcite , exist .    </S>",
    "<S> extending the standard model ( sm ) only by neutrino masses does not automatically lead to measurable charged lfv ( clfv ) , but sizable branching ratios are expected in many models . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , on quite general grounds one expects large clfv , if physics beyond the sm exists at the tev scale . a prime example for this observation is supersymmetry ( susy ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , the mass matrices of the new scalar particles need not ( and in general will not ) be aligned with those of the sm fermions . </S>",
    "<S> clfv decays will occur and one can estimate roughly the branching ratios for radiative decays as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 parameterizes the dominant off - diagonal elements of the soft susy breaking slepton mass matrices and @xmath8 is the typical mass of the susy particles , expected to be in the ballpark of @xmath9 tev . </S>",
    "<S> rather small off - diagonal elements are required to satisfy experimental bounds @xcite .    in the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( cmssm ) , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , clfv is zero , just as in the sm , simply because neutrinos are assumed to be massless . extending the cmssm to include neutrino masses ( and mixings ) , for example by a seesaw mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , then leads to clfv decays , because the flavor violation necessarily present in the yukawa couplings is transmitted to the slepton mass matrices in the rge ( renormalization group equation ) running @xcite . in such high - scale neutrino mass models , with only mssm particle content at the electroweak scale , it has been shown that the photonic penguin diagram gives the dominant contribution to @xmath0 decays in large regions of parameter space . in the limit of large @xmath10 @xcite . ] in this case a simple relation can be derived @xcite @xmath11 thus , usually it is concluded that the decays @xmath12 are more constraining than the decays @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from the photonic penguin , there are also box diagrams , higgs- and @xmath3-penguin contributing to the decays @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter diagram is not _ per se _ smaller than the photonic penguin . </S>",
    "<S> rather , as we will show below , in models with only the mssm particle content and couplings , the @xmath3-penguin is suppressed by a subtle cancellation among different terms in the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> such a cancellation , however , can be easily spoiled if there are ( a ) new couplings and/or ( b ) a larger particle content than in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> then , as we will discuss , the @xmath3-penguin can easily give the dominant contribution to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate this fact numerically with two typical example models : ( i ) a supersymmetric inverse seesaw and ( ii ) r - parity violating susy . </S>",
    "<S> the former is an example of a model with extended particle content , while the latter is an example of a model with the mssm particle content but new interactions . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show , in such models @xmath0 can be more constraining than @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main result of the present paper .    finally , we emphasize that the @xmath3-penguin can be dominant also in other observables and for other theoretical models , although this fact has not , in general , been discussed before . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath3-dominance can be found in @xmath13 conversion in nuclei in supersymmetric models with r - parity violation , as can be seen from the numerical results of reference @xcite , although the authors do not discuss it . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in the little higgs model of @xcite one finds numerical results with parameter points where @xmath14 , despite the authors concluding that both are correlated .    </S>",
    "<S> _ analytical discussion : _ the total width of the @xmath0 decay contains contributions from the photon penguin , the higgs penguin , the @xmath3-penguin and boxes . considering only contributions from photon and @xmath3-penguin , which are the ones of interest to us and numerically the most important ones , the total width @xmath15 can be written as  @xcite :    @xmath16 \\label{decay}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , terms denoted @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) are due to photon ( @xmath3 ) exchange and @xmath19 denotes their interference terms , irrelevant for the following discussion . </S>",
    "<S> both , photon and @xmath3 penguins have chargino - sneutrino and neutralino - slepton contributions . </S>",
    "<S> exact definitions can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the chargino loops for brevity here , since the effects we are interested in are most pronounced in these loops . </S>",
    "<S> the photon contributions are @xmath20 whereas the @xmath21-contributions read @xmath22 with @xmath23 . in these expressions </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 denote combinations of rotation matrices and coupling constants and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are short - hands for the passarino - veltman loop functions which depend on @xmath27 . for precise definitions </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the scaling @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be understood , in principle , from simple dimensional analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the decay is proportional to @xmath30 , so both @xmath17 and @xmath18 must be @xmath31 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it is the smallest mass term in the loop which sets the scale , which in @xmath18 is @xmath32 . due to the masslessness of the photon in case of @xmath17 the smallest mass scale in the loop is @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath34 the @xmath3 penguin can , in principle , be even more important than the photonic one .    </S>",
    "<S> numerically , however , it has been found in case of the mssm that the photonic penguin is dominant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood as follows . to simplify the discussion , </S>",
    "<S> we neglect first @xmath35 , since it is always proportional to the charged lepton yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> consider then @xmath36 generations of sneutrinos and neglect the chargino mixing . </S>",
    "<S> in this simplified scenario only the wino contributes to @xmath37 and it can be written as @xmath38 with @xmath39 summing over the index @xmath40 is implied . </S>",
    "<S> the terms in the sum come from different types of diagrams : wave function diagrams ( @xmath41 ) , penguins with the @xmath3-boson attached to the chargino line ( @xmath42 ) or the sneutrino line ( @xmath43 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is a @xmath47 unitary matrix that diagonalizes the mass matrix of the sneutrinos and we used the abbreviations @xmath48 . the sum in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> vanishes exactly as can be seen by grouping the different terms @xmath49 with @xmath50 . using the exact expressions for the loop functions @xcite </S>",
    "<S> one finds that the masses cancel out and these combinations become just numerical constants : @xmath51 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one is left with @xmath53 , which vanishes due to unitarity of the @xmath46 matrix in supersymmetry , the z - penguin contributions are found to be sub - dominant due to the same type of cancellation that is found in our work . ] .    this cancellation can be spoiled by two effects , either ( i ) the sneutrinos mix with other particles which are not @xmath54 doublets so that the factorization no longer holds , or ( ii ) the charginos are not pure wino and higgsino states . </S>",
    "<S> the last effect is of course present in the mssm and therefore this cancellation is not exact . nevertheless , the @xmath3-contributions are suppressed due to their proportionality to the square of the chargino mixing angle ( two wino - higgsino insertions are necessary since there is no @xmath55 coupling ) . </S>",
    "<S> we neglected so far higgsino interactions because in many models these couplings are very small in comparison to the gauge interactions ( for example , a susy scale type - i seesaw model would have @xmath56 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in models where the higgsino can have much larger yukawa interactions , a large enhancement of the @xmath3-contributions can be expected . </S>",
    "<S> this will be addressed numerically in the next section .    before turning to a numerical discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we consider for simplicity a toy model consisting of two generations of left - handed sneutrinos which can mix with one generation of right - handed sneutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath57 rotation matrix is in general parametrized by 3 angles , but we will assume here for simplification that two of them vanish and call the third one @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we introduce a new interaction for the higgsinos @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we give in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : approx ] the computed @xmath60 for arbitrarily chosen sneutrino and chargino masses as a function of @xmath58 for different values of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the red dotted line shows the case for @xmath62 . as clearly seen , @xmath60 depends on the left - right mixing already for small values of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> however , increasing @xmath61 , @xmath60 becomes totally dominated by the new @xmath61 interactions and enhances @xmath63 .     </S>",
    "<S> for our toy model as a function of the sneutrino left - right mixing angle @xmath58 and for different values of @xmath61 : @xmath64 ( blue ) , @xmath65 ( black dashed ) , 0.1 ( blue dashed ) and 1.0 ( black ) . ]    _ numerical examples : _ we turn to the full fledged numerical study of two examples : an inverse seesaw model and the mssm with @xmath66-parity violation . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we have created for both models spheno modules @xcite using the mathematica package sarah @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these modules calculate the low - energy observables exactly including all possible diagrams @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ inverse seesaw : _ in inverse seesaw the mssm particle content is extended by three generations of right - handed neutrino superfields @xmath67 and of gauge singlets @xmath68 which carry lepton number @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the superpotential reads @xmath69 after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) the effective mass matrix for the light neutrinos is approximately @xmath70 . since @xmath71 can be of @xmath72 kev or even smaller while @xmath73 is of @xmath74 , the neutrino yukawa couplings have to be much larger than for a standard weak - scale seesaw to explain neutrino data .    due to the extended particle content </S>",
    "<S> , new contributions for @xmath75 are expected in the inverse seesaw . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the higgs mediated contributions were recently studied in @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : invseesaw ] ( top ) we show the different contributions to @xmath76 for a variation of the susy masses . to disentangle rge effects we have calculated once the spectrum for a cmssm input ( @xmath77  gev , @xmath78  tev , @xmath79 , @xmath80  gev ) and rescaled all dimensionful parameters at the susy scale . </S>",
