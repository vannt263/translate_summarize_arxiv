    "is one of the biggest challenges in wireless networks , in which multiple transmissions occur concurrently over a common communication medium .",
    "interference is usually handled in practice by either _ interference avoidance _ in which users coordinate their transmissions by orthogonalizing their signals in time or frequency , or by _ treating - interference - as - noise _ in which users increase their transmission power and treat each other s interference as noise .",
    "_ interference decoding _ , although it is less practical , is another approach to deal with interference when interference is strong enough to be decoded along with the desired signal . + during the past three decades",
    ", information theorists have made extensive efforts to characterize the ultimate obstruction that interference impose on the capacity of wireless networks .",
    "for the two - user gaussian interference channel ( gifc ) case , which has received the most attention to date , the capacity region is completely known for some ranges of channel coefficients @xcite-@xcite . for the general two - user case ,",
    "the best result is that of @xcite in which the approximate capacity region is found to within one bit .",
    "+ by moving from two - user case to _ more than two users _ , the capacity characterization even become more challenging .",
    "in fact , in order to reduce the sever effects of interference for @xmath6 users , the use of a new technique known as _ interference alignment _ is essential .",
    "interference alignment which was firstly introduced by maddah - ali _ et .",
    "@xcite in the context of mimo @xmath7 channels , is an elegant technique that practically reduces the effect of the aggregated interference from several users to the effect of the interference from one user only .",
    "there are two versions of interference alignment in literature : _ signal space alignment _ and _ signal scale alignment_. in signal space alignment methods , as it originally proposed in @xcite , by deploying some linear pre - coding at transmitters and combining operations at receivers , the interference channel practically converted into multiple non - interfering gaussian channels .",
    "signal space alignment approaches are applicable to interference channels with time varying / frequency selective channel coefficients .",
    "signal scale alignment schemes , on the other hand , use structured coding , e.g. lattice codes , to align interference in the signal level and are especially useful in the case of constant channels . in @xcite , for the special cases of many - to - one and one - to - many gifc , authors computed the capacity region within constant bits using the signal scale alignment . for the general @xmath6 users gifc ,",
    "most of the effort has focused on a simpler problem : what is the total number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) for a @xmath6 user gifc ?",
    "the total number of dof for a gifc shows the growth of the maximum achievable sum rates in the limit of increasing signal to noise ratio ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "using the idea of signal space interference alignment , cadambe and jafar in @xcite showed that for a fully connected @xmath0 user gifc with time varying / frequency selective channel coefficients , the total number of dof is equal to @xmath9 , i.e. each user can enjoy half of its available number of dof in spite of interfering signals from other users .",
    "for the constant channel case , host - madsen and nosratinia in @xcite , conjectured that the total number of dof is upper - bounded by one regardless of the number of users .",
    "etkin and ordentlich in @xcite deployed some results of additive combinatorics to show that for a constant fully connected real gifc , the total number of dof is very sensitive to the rationality / irrationality of channel coefficients .",
    "they showed that for a fully connected constant real gifc with rational channel coefficients , the total number of dof is strictly less than @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , they showed that for a class of measure zero of channel coefficients , the total number of dof is equal to @xmath9 .",
    "independently , motahari _ et . al _ showed in @xcite that for a three user constant symmetric real gifc with irrational channel coefficients , the total number of dof is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "however , their assumption on the structure of channel , i.e. symmetric channel , restricted its scope to a subset of measure zero of all possible channel coefficients . for a constant gifc with complex channel coefficients , cadambe _ et .",
    "al _ in @xcite , settled the host - madsen and nosratinia conjecture in the negative by introducing asymmetric complex signaling .",
    "they showed that the @xmath0 user complex gifc with constant coefficients has at least 1.2 degrees of freedom for almost all values of channel coefficients .",
    "recently , motahari _ et . al _ settled the problem in general by proposing a new type of interference alignment that can achieve @xmath9 degrees of freedom for almost all @xmath0-user real gifc with constant coefficients @xcite .",
    "the key tools introduced in @xcite to establish this result is a new technique of interference alignment which used results from diophantine approximation in number theory @xcite to show that interference can be aligned based on the properties of rationals and irrationals .",
    "+ extending the aforementioned results to the @xmath0 user multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) interference channel is straightforward when the number of transmit antennas is equal to the number of receive antennas . in fact ,",
    "based on the results of @xcite , it is not hard to see that for a @xmath0 user @xmath11 mimo interference channel the total number of dof is equal to @xmath12 whether the channel is constant or time verying / frequnecy selective .",
    "however , extending this conclusion to the general @xmath0 user @xmath13 mimo interference channel is not straightforward . in @xcite",
    ", the authors proved that for the @xmath0 user @xmath13 mimo interference channel , the total number of degrees of freedom is equal to @xmath14 if @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the floor function .",
    "this result holds for both time - varying and constant channel coefficients . for @xmath18",
    ", they showed that @xmath19 degrees of freedom can be achieved if channel coefficients are time - varying and drawn from a continuous distribution .",
    "they also proved that for @xmath18 , the total number of dof is upper - bounded by @xmath20 whether the channel is constant or time - varying .",
    "another related work is @xcite in which suh and tse considered the problem of interference alignment for cellular networks . using a method called subspace interference alignment",
    ", they showed that for a cellular system as the number of users in each cell increases , the total number of dof also increases and approaches to the interference free dof . to show this surprising result",
    ", they introduced the randomness of multi - path channels into their equations .",

    "thus , the minimization in ( [ d1- ] ) and ( [ d1 + ] ) can be easily handled .      in the statement of the theorem [ achievability theorem ]",

    "in each cell , there is a base station which is equipped with multiple antennas and covers all users in that cell .",
    "since there is no cooperation among receive antennas in our approach , we can consider each cell as a mimo transmit / receive pair in our mimo interference network model where the number of transmit antennas is equal to the number of antennas of the base station and the number of receive antennas is equal to the number of users in that cell .",
    "when there is a large number of cells in the system , by increasing the number of users in each cell , the dof per cell increases and approaches to the number of antennas of the base station .",

    "we define three sets @xmath84 , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 as follows @xmath231 @xmath232 @xmath233 we select directions for the first and second part of transmit signal @xmath49 respectively as @xmath234 where @xmath235 assume @xmath196 is a fixed positive integer .",
    "the exponents @xmath236 are selected by the following rules    @xmath237    @xmath238    using these selections , we claim that all signals in ( [ received3 ] ) with a brace under them are aligned . to see this ,",
    "look at the coefficients of @xmath239 in the first part of the received signals in ( [ received3 ] ) . thanks to our selections , all channel pairs appear in the first part of the received signals have been used in @xmath239 with an exponent up to @xmath196 except those belong to @xmath240 that used with an exponent up to @xmath241 .",
    "since @xmath239 has all the elements of @xmath240 as its coefficients in the first part of the output signals , we conclude that the exponents of any element in @xmath239 would not exceed @xmath196 in the first part of the output signals .",
    "the same story is true for all other signals .",
    "in fact , if we define a set @xmath242 as the set of all directions like ( [ transmit directions ] ) with @xmath243 for all @xmath191 , the set of all directions in any interference term in the first part of the received signals would be a subset of @xmath242 . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] depicts the effect of this alignment on the received signals .",
    "the number of distinct directions in @xmath211 and @xmath212 is equal to @xmath244 the number of distinct interference directions in any of the received signals , e.g. in @xmath245 is @xmath246 hence using arguments similar to what explained in the previous section and according to theorem [ abolfazl - second ] , we can conclude that the following number of dof is achievable per receive antenna @xmath247 since @xmath196 is an arbitrary constant , taking supremum over @xmath196 yield dof equal to @xmath248 per receive antenna which leads to a total number of dof equal to @xmath249 .",
    "in this section , we show that how the results of the previous section can be easily generalized to the @xmath0 user @xmath13 interference channel .",
    "we choose the transmitted signal of user @xmath49 on antenna @xmath164 to have the following form @xmath250 where @xmath251 is designed to be decodable at the @xmath52 receive antenna of user @xmath49 and seems like interference for the other receive antennas of this user .",
    "the received signal at the @xmath52 received antenna of user @xmath49 can be written as @xmath252 substituating ( [ 1 ] ) in ( [ 2 ] ) yields    @xmath253    similar to the 3 user case , we should carefully distribute the available degrees of freedom among @xmath254 .",
    "we select @xmath255 as @xmath256 where @xmath257 carry information and @xmath258 is a constant real number playing the role of a direction in our interference alignment scheme .",
    "@xmath259 is the set of directions assigned to @xmath255 and @xmath260 denotes its cardinality .",
    "each of the elements of @xmath259 is in the following form @xmath261}^{s_{j , m',n',i}},\\ ] ] where @xmath262 s are integers taking values in the following ranges depends on the values of @xmath263 , and @xmath58 @xmath264 in order to calculate the multiplexing gain of the system , we need to determine the cardinality of @xmath259 . from ( [ 6 ] )",
    "we have @xmath265 at the receiver side , we need to compute @xmath266 , the number of independent received directions due to the interference in @xmath267 . similar to what is explained for the 3 user case , it is not hard to show that @xmath268    therefore , according to theorem [ abolfazl - second ] , the following number of dof can be achieved per receive antenna @xmath269    taking supremum over @xmath196 , leads to a total number of dof equal to @xmath66 .",
    "in this paper , we obtain new results for the total number of dof for the constant mimo interference channel .",
    "we show that how a recently introduced interference alignment technique can be uses to achieve higher number of dof for mimo interference channel .",
    "we also introduce a new outer - bound on the total number of dof for a mimo interference channel which coincides with our achievable dof when the number of users is larger than some threshold which depends on the number of transmit and receive antennas . since there is no cooperation among transmit",
