    "the oslo cyclotron group has developed a method to extract first - generation ( primary ) @xmath0-ray spectra at various initial excitation energies @xcite . from the set of primary spectra ,",
    "nuclear level densities and @xmath0-ray strength functions can be extracted @xcite .",
    "these two functions reveal essential nuclear structure information such as shell gaps , pair correlations , and thermal and electromagnetic properties . in the last couple of years",
    ", the oslo group has demonstrated several fruitful applications of the method @xcite .",
    "so far , the method has been tested on rare earth nuclei , having a rather uniform and high single - particle level density .",
    "these properties are expected to be important for the foundation of the method .",
    "the two crucial steps in the extraction procedure are :  ( i ) the subtraction technique for obtaining the primary @xmath0-ray spectra , and ( ii ) the brink - axel hypothesis telling that nuclear resonances with approximately equal properties can be built on all states .",
    "thus , the most important requirements are that the spin and parity distributions should be similar for all excitation energy bins and that the nucleus should thermalize at each step within a given @xmath0 cascade .",
    "although not finally validated , the method has been tested and found successful for deformed rare - earth nuclei @xcite and even for the weakly deformed @xmath10sm nuclei @xcite . however , in cases where the statistical properties are less favourable , as for lighter nuclei and/or for nuclei in the vicinity of closed shells , the foundation of the method is more doubtful . since both @xmath5si and @xmath1si of the present study are open - shell systems in the middle of the @xmath11 shell , only the statistical question remains here .    from a statistical point of view",
    "it is important that for light nuclei having low level density one can expect a strong influence of porter - thomas fluctuations on @xmath0-transition intensities of primary @xmath0 spectra and hence , on extracted level densities and @xmath0-ray strength functions .",
    "this means that the main assumptions of the oslo method can fail , namely that the applicability of the axel - brink hypothesis can loose its meaning because of large @xmath0-intensity fluctuations and insufficient averaging over nuclear levels due to a low level density . from this point of view",
    "it is interesting to establish the limit of the applicability of the oslo method by investigating light nuclei .    in this work ,",
    "we have tested the extraction procedure on the light @xmath5si and @xmath1si systems , applying the ( @xmath2he,@xmath12 ) pick - up reaction and the ( @xmath2he,@xmath2he ) inelastic scattering reaction , respectively . since",
    "both the level density and the @xmath0-decay rates are known in these nuclei , a quantitative judgment of the applicability of the procedure is feasible .",
    "section 2 describes the experimental methods and techniques , and in sections 3 and 4 the level density and @xmath0-ray strength are discussed . finally , concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the oslo cyclotron laboratory with a 45  mev @xmath2he beam .",
    "the self - supporting @xmath1si target was isotopically enriched to @xmath13 and had a thickness of 3  mg/@xmath14 .",
    "the reactions employed in the extraction procedure were @xmath1si(@xmath2he,@xmath3si and @xmath1si@xmath15he,@xmath2he@xmath4si .    the charged particles and @xmath0 rays were recorded with the detector array cactus , which contains eight particle telescopes , 27  nai @xmath0-ray detectors and two additional ge detectors monitoring the spin distribution and the selectivity of the reactions .",
    "each telescope is placed at an angle of 45@xmath16 relative to the beam axis , and comprises one si front and one si(li ) back detector with thicknesses of 140 and 3000  @xmath17 m , respectively .",
    "the nai @xmath0-detector array surrounding the target and particle detectors has a resolution of @xmath18 at @xmath19  mev and a total efficiency of @xmath20 .    in figures [ fig : pp14he ] and [ fig :",
    "pp13he ] , the single and coincidence ejectile spectra are shown for the reactions @xmath1si@xmath15he,@xmath21si and @xmath1si@xmath15he,@xmath2he@xmath22si , respectively .",
    "the ground state in @xmath5si is located at higher ejectile energy due to a positive @xmath23 value of 3.40  mev in the @xmath15he,@xmath24 reaction . in @xmath5si and @xmath1si , pronounced peak structures are seen up to 5 and 10  mev excitation energy , respectively .",
    "the coincident spectra show a drop in yield at the proton binding energies @xmath25 , since the residual nucleus with one proton less ( aluminium ) is then populated at low excitation energy with a corresponding low @xmath0-ray multiplicity .",
    "our extraction method is therefore only applicable up to the excitation energy of @xmath26 .",
    "the spin window of the present pick - up and elastic scattering reactions is concentrated at @xmath27 .    in order to determine the true @xmath0-energy distribution , the @xmath0 spectra",
    "are corrected for the response of the nai detectors with the unfolding procedure of @xcite .",
    "in addition , random coincidences are subtracted from the @xmath0 spectra .",
    "the resulting unfolded nai @xmath0 spectra are shown in figure [ fig : ug34helog ] .",
    "the spectra reveal strong @xmath0 lines , which are identified as transitions between low - lying states .",
    "the set of unfolded @xmath0 spectra are organized in a @xmath28 matrix , where the initial excitation energies @xmath29 of @xmath5si and @xmath1si are determined by means of reaction kinematics , utilizing the energy of the ejectile .",
    "this matrix comprises the @xmath0-energy distribution of the total @xmath0 cascade .",
    "the primary-@xmath0 matrix can now be found according to the subtraction technique of @xcite .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , the primary @xmath0-ray procedure is based on the assumption that the decay properties of the particular reaction - selected distribution of states within each energy bin are independent on whether the respective ensembles of states are directly populated through the nuclear reaction or by @xmath0 decay from higher - lying states . in the present case ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray multiplicity is low and reaches @xmath30 around 10  mev excitation energy .",
    "thus , generally less than half of the counts in the total @xmath0 spectra have to be subtracted in the procedure , giving quite reliable primary @xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : firstgenexp ] , where we compare our results to known @xmath0-decay branches from various excitation - energy regions @xcite . here , in the reconstruction of primary @xmath0 spectra from known @xmath0 transitions ,",
    "we have assumed equal population of the initial levels within each energy bin .",
    "taking into account that probably not all levels and branchings are known , the agreement is very satisfactory .",
    "it should be noted that possible porter - thomas fluctuations will reveal themselves in exactly the same way in the literature data and the extracted primary @xmath0 spectra .",
    "thus , agreement between the two spectra of figure [ fig : firstgenexp ] should not be surprising from a statistical point of view .",
    "the idea is now to find two functions , the level density @xmath31 and the @xmath0-energy - dependent function @xmath32 , that , multiplied with each other , reproduce the set of primary @xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "the @xmath32 function is identified as the so - called @xmath0-ray transmission coefficient . according to the brink - axel hypothesis @xcite",
    ", the primary @xmath0-ray spectra can be factorized by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is fitted to the primary @xmath0-ray matrix by a least @xmath35 fit @xcite . in the factorization procedure , we use primary spectra from the initial excitation - energy regions of @xmath367.6  mev and @xmath3712.1  mev for @xmath5si and @xmath1si , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0-energy regions were chosen to be @xmath387.6  mev and @xmath3912.1  mev .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fgteo ] , the best fits ( solid lines ) to the experimental @xmath40 are shown for the @xmath5si and @xmath1si nuclei . the experimental spectra exhibit strong peak structures that are in good correlation in spite of the fact that they have been obtained at different excitation energies .",
    "the correlation indicates that the peak structures are mainly due to the @xmath0-ray transmission coefficient @xmath41 which is assumed to be independent of the excitation energies of initial and final states .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that the highly structured experimental spectra are seen to be fairly well described by the factorization in equation ( [ eq : ab ] ) .",
    "the expected porter - thomas fluctuations can be estimated from the deviations of the experimental points from the solid line in figure [ fig : fgteo ] , which demonstrate that the fluctuations are of minor importance for the extracted level densities and @xmath0-ray transmission coefficients .    in our extraction procedure , we assume that the @xmath0-ray transmission coefficient @xmath41 is independent of the excitation energy ( or temperature ) .",
    "although no strict violation of this assumption has been determined experimentally , theoretical predictions show that @xmath41 may depend on the thermal properties of the final state . in order to estimate the influence of such effects ,",
    "we have applied the temperature dependent model of kadmenski , markushev and furman @xcite for electric dipole transitions .",
    "the model describes a @xmath0-ray strength function based on the low energy tail of the giant electric dipole resonance ( gedr ) , where we use gedr parameters from @xcite . to evaluate the temperature at a certain excitation energy , we use @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the intrinsic excitation energy and the level density parameter , respectively .",
    "these parameters are determined according to von egidy _",
    "_ @xcite . in our experiment , we measure @xmath0 spectra from a certain initial excitation energy @xmath29 , and the temperature @xmath45 is determined by the excitation energy of the final state @xmath46 .",
    "since we use spectra from several @xmath29 for a given @xmath47 , also the final excitation energy will change accordingly , giving different temperatures for different @xmath0 energies .",
    "for the tests , we used the kmf model including this variation in temperature with @xmath0 energies , and compared with a calculation where the temperature is kept constant . here , we find for @xmath1si that the @xmath48 values deviate within 20 % for @xmath49 mev .",
    "however , for lower @xmath47 the @xmath48 value with variable temperature increases and gains a factor of two at @xmath50 mev compared to the value of @xmath48 taken at a constant temperature . the varying temperature is associated with a standard deviation of @xmath51 mev , which will reduced this difference somewhat . since",
    "the predicted temperature dependence is highly uncertain , if existing at all in real silicon nuclei , we omit to include this uncertainty in the experimental error bars .",
    "the multiplicative functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 of equation ( [ eq : ab ] ) are not uniquely determined . actually , one may construct an infinite number of other functions @xcite , which give identical fits to the data of figure [ fig : fgteo ] by @xmath52\\,\\rho(e - e_\\gamma ) , \\label{eq : array1}\\\\ \\tilde{\\mathcal t}(e_\\gamma)&=&b\\exp(\\alpha e_\\gamma){\\mathcal t}(e_\\gamma ) .",
    "\\label{eq : array2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , neither the slope nor the absolute value of the two functions can be obtained through the fitting procedure .",
    "thus , the free parameters @xmath7 , @xmath53 and @xmath12 have to be determined from other information to give the best physical solution .",
    "the @xmath5si and @xmath1si nuclei have been thoroughly studied during the last decades , and the level schemes are probably fairly complete up to several mev excitation energy . by smoothing the known level density taken from the database of @xcite with the experimental energy resolution",
    ", we can adjust the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath12 of our experimental @xmath54 to fit the level density to the number of known levels .",
    "the adjustments were performed at @xmath55 and 5.0  mev in @xmath5si and at @xmath56 and 7.0  mev in @xmath1si .",
    "these anchor points are well determined and separated in excitation energy , however , also other data points could as well be used .",
    "figure [ fig : acc34he ] compares cumulated number of levels based on our data ( data points ) and known levels ( histogram ) taken from @xcite .",
    "the overall agreement is gratifying .",
    "local differences can be caused by violation of the axel - brink hypotheses for light nuclei , where low level density and large fluctuations of @xmath0 intensity is observed .",
    "for example , in @xmath1si , the level density around the ground state is strongly underestimated in the experiment , because very few transitions decay directly to the @xmath57 ground state .",
    "this property is less pronounced in @xmath5si , having a ground state assignment of @xmath58 . since these nuclei have been well studied , we are not able to extract much more information on the level density than what is already known . however , our data give a small indication that not all levels in @xmath1si have yet been observed above 9  mev excitation energy .",
    "very few explicit calculations of level densities exist .",
    "this would be needed , since a simple fermi - gas approximation based on the level - density parameter @xmath44 and the pairing - gap parameter @xmath59 neglects residual interactions . in the calculations of ormand @xcite ,",
    "the level densities of @xmath60 mg and @xmath61s were studied in a monte - carlo shell - model approach within the @xmath11 shell .",
    "it is interesting that the level density in @xmath60 mg behaves very much like the nuclei studied here .",
    "the fact that there are only one hundred levels per mev at excitation energies of 812  mev has implications .",
    "it indicates that if specific states are selected by some reaction , e.g. , @xmath12-cluster states with large parentage of @xmath62 configurations , the number of states of this kind necessarily must be significantly lower .",
    "however , at this stage , it is not possible to give quantitative statements of the number of , e.g. , @xmath12-cluster states in this region .    in general , the most successful way to create additional states in atomic nuclei is to break up @xmath63 nucleon cooper pairs .",
    "each broken pair increases the level density by a factor of 10 - 20 , which is much higher than obtained from other modes of excitation as , e.g. , rotation or vibration .",
    "recently @xcite , a thermodynamic model was developed which could describe level densities for mid - shell nuclei in the mass regions @xmath64 , 106 , 162 , and 234 .",
    "the model is based on the canonical ensemble theory , where equilibrium is obtained at a certain given temperature @xmath45 .",
    "the basic idea of the model @xcite is the assumption of a reservoir of proton and neutron pairs .",
    "the pairs may be broken such that unpaired nucleons are thermally scattered into an infinite , equidistant , doubly - degenerated single - particle level scheme .",
    "in addition , rotational and vibrational modes may be thermally excited .",
    "the total partition function is written as a product of proton @xmath65 , neutron @xmath66 , rotation @xmath67 , and vibration @xmath68 partition functions . then ,",
    "from the helmholtz free energy @xmath69 thermodynamical quantities as entropy , average excitation energy , and heat capacity can be calculated as @xmath70 where the boltzmann constant is set to unity @xmath71 and the temperature @xmath45 is measured in mev .",
    "the level density is calculated applying the saddle - point approximation @xcite @xmath72    the energy spacing between the single - particle orbitals @xmath73 is the most critical parameter of the model . in order to determine @xmath73 , we investigate the well - studied @xmath74al and @xmath5al isotopes , where the level density is presumably known up to high excitation energy from the counting of experimentally observed levels @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : aluteo ] shows these experimental data together with a level - density point evaluated for @xmath1al @xcite from the average neutron - resonance spacing @xcite at the neutron binding energy @xmath75 .",
    "the slopes of the level densities are well reproduced with @xmath76  mev , which is consistent with the energy gaps in the nilsson single - particle level scheme .",
    "the difference in level density between @xmath74al and @xmath5al depends strongly on the pairing - gap energy and is well described by a gap parameter of @xmath77  mev@xmath78  mev , using @xmath79 .",
    "the pairing - attenuation factor , defined as the ratio between the amount of energy needed to break one nucleon pair compared to the previous broken pair , is set to @xmath80 ( for details see @xcite ) . for simplicity",
    ", we have used the same values of @xmath73 , @xmath59 , and @xmath81 for protons and neutrons .",
    "furthermore , all calculations include a reservoir of seven proton and seven neutron pairs .",
    "the collective parameters are taken from experimental data on @xmath1si .",
    "the rotational parameter @xmath82  mev is calculated from the first excited state @xmath83 , and the vibrational energy @xmath84  mev is set equal to the excitation energy of the first non - rotational state @xmath85 .",
    "the very same parameter set is used in the calculation for @xmath5si and @xmath1si in figure [ fig : expteo ] .",
    "the calculation describes well the experimental data of @xmath5si for excitation energies above @xmath86  mev . for @xmath1si ,",
    "the more statistical and smooth part of the level density takes place first above @xmath87  mev , making it difficult to judge the agreement between model and experiment in this case .    by comparing the level densities between even - even ( @xmath1si ) , odd-@xmath7 ( @xmath5al or @xmath5si ) , and odd - odd ( @xmath74al ) systems , we may extract interesting information . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfec ] , the free energy @xmath88 , entropy @xmath89 , average excitation energy @xmath90 , and heat capacity @xmath91 are shown as functions of temperature for the three systems .",
    "a fruitful quantity is the entropy difference @xmath92 between systems with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . at low temperatures ,",
    "this quantity is approximately extensive ( additive ) and represents the single - particle entropy associated with the valence particle ( or hole ) @xcite . in the upper right panel",
    ", we find that the nucleon carries a single - particle entropy of @xmath93 at @xmath94  mev .",
    "the single - particle entropy can also be deduced from the experimental data of aluminium ( and possibly also from silicon ) .",
    "the high - energy data points of figure [ fig : aluteo ] reveal that the level density of @xmath74al is @xmath95 times higher than for @xmath5al .",
    "remembering that the level density and entropy are connected by @xmath96 we deduce also here @xmath93 .",
    "the statistical definition of temperature in the microcanonical ensemble is given by @xmath97 giving typically @xmath6  mev for the data points of @xmath5al in the excitation - energy region of 711  mev , see figure [ fig : aluteo ] .",
    "since the excitation - energy shift between the level densities of figure [ fig : aluteo ] amounts approximately to the pairing - gap parameter @xmath59 , we may express the slope of @xmath98 as @xmath99 or , according to equations ( [ eq : lnrho ] ) and ( [ eq : t ] ) , as @xmath100 , giving @xmath101 which again confirms @xmath102 .    the extracted single - particle entropy is lower than observed in heavier mid - shell nuclei where typically @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the recent findings are supported by the systematics of figure [ fig : counta7 ] , where the experimentally deduced level densities at @xmath104  mev are displayed for various nuclear systems .",
    "these data points are evaluated as a linear interpolation of @xmath105 between two anchor points : ( i ) the level density based on known levels at low excitation energy and ( ii ) the level density estimated from neutron resonance energy spacings at the neutron binding energy @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : counta7 ] shows larger error bars and more scattered data for mass numbers below @xmath106 , which mainly reflects that the first anchor point is strongly influenced by local shell effects .",
    "however , in spite of local shell effects below @xmath106 , it is clear that the level densities drop one order of magnitude , and the level density gaps between various systems are severely reduced . from our model calculations ,",
    "this change is due to a decrease in the ratio between the temperature @xmath45 and the single - particle energy spacing @xmath73 . in the mass region studied here , the temperature and spacing are approximately equal , i.e. , @xmath107 , and the valence nucleon is thermally smeared over the ground state and the first excited single - particle level , giving @xmath108 , only . in the rare earth region",
    ", we have typically @xmath109 and the valence nucleon is thermally spread over several single - particle levels , giving higher entropy .",
    "the heat - capacity curves of figure [ fig : sfec ] show s - shaped forms , in particular for the even - even system .",
    "the local maximum of this shape appears at @xmath110  mev , corresponding to an excitation energy of @xmath111  mev . at this point , the excitation energy increases strongly with temperature , indicating a substantial breaking of nuclear cooper pairs .",
    "it is tempting to connect this overshoot in heat capacity with a pairing - phase transition . in order to test this ,",
    "we have studied the distribution of zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature plane , as prescribed in @xcite . in our calculations , we find that the zeros move away from the real , inverse - temperature axis with increasing inverse temperature .",
    "this property is inconsistent with a pairing - phase transition in the thermodynamical limit of @xmath112 , in accordance with the generalized ehrenfest definition of a phase transition @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion has also been drawn for the fe mass region @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray energy - dependent function @xmath113 contains information on the average @xmath0-decay probability . in figure",
    "[ fig : strength ] , the non - normalized @xmath113 of equation ( [ eq : array2 ] ) is shown with the @xmath12 parameter determined in section 3 .",
    "the two extreme data points at @xmath114 and 5.0  mev for @xmath5si and @xmath1si , respectively , are probably due to a singularity in the extraction method , giving too small error bars .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the regularity of the @xmath0-decay strength in the continuum is determined by the @xmath0-ray strength function @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the transition energy , @xmath117 denotes the electric or magnetic character , @xmath118 is the multipolarity , @xmath119 is the partial radiative width , and @xmath120 is the level spacing of states with spins and parities equal to those of the initial state @xmath121 . the main part of high - lying levels is known to decay by @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xmath0 transitions .",
    "thus , one could in principle extract @xmath124 from the present experiment in the same way as has been done for several rare - earth nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , the concept of an average radiative width is difficult to adopt for these light nuclei , since there is no experimental information on the mean values of the level spacing @xmath120 ; there are less than one level per mev with presumably the same spin and parity .    even though the absolute strength of @xmath125 is uncertain , its functional dependence on @xmath116 can be studied .",
    "the shape of the measured @xmath0-ray transmission coefficient is given by @xmath126e_\\gamma^{2\\lambda+1}.\\ ] ] if the transitions are mainly governed by single - particle dipole transitions , an @xmath127 shape would be expected according to the weisskopf estimate , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 take constant values .",
    "the functional form is displayed in figure [ fig : strength ] .",
    "both @xmath5si and @xmath1si show a rather flat shape of @xmath130 for @xmath1315  mev .",
    "however , for @xmath1325  mev , @xmath1si follows roughly the @xmath127 dependence , indicating that the transitions are rather of single - particle than collective origin as found for rare - earth nuclei @xcite .",
    "also , the large spread in lifetimes @xcite of the high - lying levels supports this interpretation .    in @xmath1si , levels and their lifetimes and @xmath0-decay branching ratios",
    "are known up to 9.6 mev of excitation energy from discrete @xmath0 spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "thus , we may define the decay intensity in terms of the partial ( @xmath133 ) and total ( @xmath134 ) decay widths by @xmath135 , where the @xmath0-transition energy is determined by the excitation energies of the initial ( @xmath121 ) and final ( @xmath136 ) states by @xmath137 . for this case",
    ", the @xmath0-ray transmission coefficient reads @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the lifetime of level @xmath121 . here",
    ", we roughly estimate @xmath120 from the total level density using the spin distribution of @xcite .",
    "the constructed @xmath0-ray transmission coefficient is then smoothed as a function of @xmath116 with the experimental resolution . despite the fact that not all levels and decay branches are known , figure [ fig : strength ] shows that the smoothed @xmath0-ray transmission coefficient compares surprisingly well with the extracted data points .",
    "this indicates that the method may work even in cases where no well - behaving smooth @xmath0-ray strength function is present .",
    "a simultaneous extraction of level densities and @xmath0-ray transmission coefficients in @xmath140si has been performed .",
    "comparison to literature data gives excellent agreement within the experimental resolution .",
    "this study demonstrates that the extraction method also works for light nuclei , despite the fact that thermalization might seem questionable .",
    "the concept of a @xmath0-ray strength function in this mass region is not very useful .",
    "the measured @xmath0-energy dependence of approximately @xmath127 indicates that the @xmath0 decay is governed by single - particle dipole transitions .",
    "a simple thermodynamical model reproduces the high excitation - energy region of the experimental data . for @xmath140si and @xmath141al",
    ", we conclude that a nuclear temperature of @xmath6  mev and a pairing gap parameter of @xmath142  mev describes the level densities at high excitation energies .",
    "both experiment and model indicate that the valence nucleon in this mass region carries an entropy of @xmath93 .",
    "this is close to the expected value of 0.7 when the thermal nucleonic excitation is smeared over the ground state and only one excited single - particle level .",
    "the pair breaking process is strongly smeared out in temperature ( and excitation energy ) and a phase transition in the sense of the ehrenfest definition is doubtful .",
    "the present work encourages also similar studies in the mass region @xmath143100 . here",
    ", nuclear level densities are used in the determination of nuclear reaction cross sections from hauser - feshbach type of calculations .",
