    "_ multiple hard parton interactions _ ( mpi ) is an important element of the picture of strong interactions at high energies .",
    "the issue attracts a lot of attention .",
    "a series of theoretical studies were carried out in the last decade @xcite .",
    "attempts have been made to incorporate multi - parton collisions into event generators @xcite .",
    "multi - parton interactions can serve as a probe for _ non - perturbative correlations _ between partons in the nucleon wave function and are crucial for determining the structure of the underlying event at lhc energies .",
    "they constitute an important background for new physics searches at the lhc .",
    "a number of experimental studies were performed at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "new measurements are underway at the lhc @xcite .",
    "double hard parton scattering in hadron  hadron collisions ( dpi ) can contribute to production of _ four _ hadron jets with large transverse momenta @xmath0 , of _ two _ electroweak bosons , or `` mixed '' ensembles comprising three jets and @xmath1 , two jets and @xmath2 , etc .",
    "in this paper we present the numerical results for a variety of final states .",
    "however , for the sake of definiteness , in what follows we refer to production of four final state jets in the collision of partons 1 and 2 from one incident hadron with partons 3 and 4 from the second hadron : @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "double hard interaction is a process difficult to approach theoretically .",
    "formally speaking , it calls for analysis of four - parton operators that emerge in the squared matrix element describing a two - parton state in a hadron .",
    "relevant objects  quasi - parton operators  were introduced and classified , and evolution of their matrix elements studied by bukhvostov et .",
    "al in the eighties in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "an approach to mpi based on the operator product expansion and on the notion of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmd ) is being developed in @xcite .",
    "mpi is a multi - scale problem . not only because the separate parton  parton interactions may differ in hardness .",
    "more importantly , _",
    "each _ single hard interaction possesses _ two _ very different hardness scales .",
    "the distinctive feature of dpi is that it produces two pairs of nearly back - to - back jets , so that    [ eq : deltas ] _ 13 ^ 2 & & ( _ 1 + _ 3)^2 q_1 ^ 2 = j_1 ^ 2_3 ^ 2 , + _ 24 ^ 2 & & ( _ 2 + _ 4)^2",
    "q_2 ^ 2 = j_2 ^ 2_4 ^ 2 .",
    "hence , in the collision of partons 1 and 3 the first ( larger ) scale is given by the invariant mass of the jet pair , @xmath5 , while the second scale is the magnitude of the _ total transverse momentum _ of the pair : @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to stress that in the mpi physics there is _ no factorization _ in the usual sense of the word .",
    "the cross sections do not factorize into the product of the hard parton interaction cross sections and the multi - parton distributions depending on momentum fractions @xmath7 and the hard scale(s ) .    in @xcite",
    "we have introduced necessary theoretical tools for approaching the problem by introducing the _ generalized double parton distributions _ ( @xmath8s ) in the momentum space .",
    "the double - parton gpd depends on one extra variable as compared to the double - parton distribution  the transverse momentum mismatch @xmath9 between the partons in the wave function and the wave function conjugated . in the mixed space of longitudinal momenta and transverse coordinates ,",
    "an object equivalent to @xmath8 has been introduced by treleani and paver in the early eighties @xcite , and was long present in the literature since , see , in particular , @xcite .    in order to construct a viable model for the two - parton distribution stemming from the non - perturbative parton wave function of the proton and , in particular , for the @xmath10-dependence of the corresponding part of @xmath8",
    ", we have exploited the existing experimental information obtained by the hera experiments .",
    "this model disregards ( rather arbitrarily , for lack of anything better ) any _ long - range correlations _ between the partons in the proton wave function , which approximation seems reasonable in a limited range of parton momenta @xmath11 ( see section  [ sec : model ] for details ) .",
    "this allows one to expresses the non - perturbative @xmath8 via the standard generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) studied at hera .    in @xcite",
    "we have studied how do perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) phenomena affect two - parton correlations .",
    "one obvious effect is `` scaling violation '' due to parton multiplication processes in higher orders .",
    "another important effect is _ short - range correlations _ induced by perturbative parton splitting , giving rise to _ three - parton collisions_. such contributions we will label as 2(``@xmath12 '' of @xcite , `` @xmath13 '' of @xcite ) .",
    "this contribution to double hard interactions emerges as a result of collision of two partons from one hadron with the two offspring of the perturbative splitting of a single parton taken from another hadron .",
    "perturbative splitting of one parton into two as a contributor to double - parton distributions was being discussed in the literature for a long time , see , e.g. , @xcite . however , for a relevant object  double - parton gpd  it was embedded into the parton evolution picture only recently .",
    "the pqcd expressions for fully differential distributions were derived in the leading collinear approximation in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we examine how various contributions to the differential distribution , being integrated over transverse momentum imbalances , give rise to the expression for the _ integrated cross section _ in terms of the product of @xmath8s of colliding hadrons .",
    "the results of numerical studies of the integrated dpi cross sections based on the theory and the model for non - perturbative two - parton distributions in the proton developed earlier are reported .",
    "we demonstrate that the 2  processes contribute significantly to the dpi cross section and , in particular , are capable of explaining the longstanding tevatron puzzle @xcite .",
    "namely , that the dpi cross section extracted by the the cdf and d0 at @xmath14 turned out to be a factor of two larger than the expectation based on the approximation of independent partons in the proton with the transverse distance spread extracted from the hera data @xcite .    this observation does not exclude the presence of genuinely non - perturbative correlations between partons in the proton .",
    "however , we find it interesting that the pqcd induced correlations alone could explain the scale of the enhancement found by the tevatron experiments .",
    "we also discuss the pattern of the @xmath15- and @xmath16-dependence of the effective interaction area ( aka `` effective cross section '' ) induced by pqcd correlations at tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section  [ sec : hidden ] we reflect upon intrinsic complexity of theoretical mpi analysis . in section  [ sec",
    ": gpd ] we remind the reader the basics of our approach to generalized two - parton distributions , @xmath8 , and discuss the approximations adopted for constructing the model for @xmath8 in terms of the standard gpds .    in section  [ sec : p2pcor ] we discuss importance of perturbative parton correlations and give a semi - quantitative estimate of their magnitude .",
    "section  [ sec:12 ] is devoted to three - parton interactions ( 2   subprocesses ) .",
    "here we reexamine the role of the so - called `` short split '' term in 2  subprocesses which is concentrated in the kinematical region of nearly equal transverse momentum imbalances , @xmath17 see @xcite .",
    "we show here that the `` short split '' contribution to the _ integrated cross section _ is actually contained in @xmath18 that one obtains integrating the simple ddt - like formula derived in the complimentary kinematical region @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus we correct ( and simplify ) the expression for the integrated dpi cross section ( original eq .",
    "( 28 ) of @xcite was plagued by double counting ) .    in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we discuss the independent parton model for the non - perturbative part of two - parton correlations .",
    "the numerical results for tevatron and lhc energies are presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "we conclude and discuss the results and perspectives of dpi studies in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "an important question is , whether mpi admit an intuitive probabilistic parton interpretation as do the classical single hard interaction processes .    when one considers inclusive one - parton distribution in a hadron ( pdf ) , the quantum state of the parton in the light - cone hadron wave function ( w.f . )",
    "coincides with that in the wave function conjugated ( w.f.c . ) .",
    "this lays down the foundation for the probabilistic qcd improved parton picture .    in the case of the two - parton correlation",
    "the situation is different . here only the overall quantum characteristics of the parton pair as a whole ( its total energy - momentum , its spin and color states ) should be identical in the w.f .   and w.f.c .",
    "as a result , the momentum , spin and color state of a single parton in the pair do not necessarily match in the wave function and in the wave function conjugated , thus endangering the very probabilistic interpretation of the process under consideration .",
    "a general approach to double hard interactions has been developed in @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the _ transverse momentum _ of the parton in the w.f .  and that of its counterpart in the w.f.c",
    ".  are indeed necessarily different , with their difference @xmath21 being conjugate to the relative transverse distance between the two partons in the hadron .",
    "this has led to introduction of the notion of the _ generalized double parton distribution _ , @xmath8 , which depends on a new momentum parameter @xmath21 .",
    "it is important to stress that the cross section of the double hard process does not factorize into the product of the hard cross section and parton distributions .",
    "instead , it contains a convolution of the product of two @xmath8s over @xmath22 .",
    "non - diagonality in the longitudinal momentum fractions is there too .",
    "representing incident partons as plain waves with definite momenta , one ignores the fact that the two partons originate from one and the same finite size hadron . therefore , when one picks two partons with momenta @xmath23 , @xmath24 from the hadron wave function , one has to integrate over @xmath25 at the level of the amplitude , which integration ensures that the longitudinal separation between the partons does not exceed the size of the parent hadron . when one considers independent hard interactions of two pairs of partons , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , taken from colliding hadrons , integrals over @xmath28 and @xmath29 do not manifest themselves , since all four longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath7 are uniquely determined by the kinematics of the two produced hard systems .",
    "not so for 2   processes . in this case",
    "a flow of large momenta between the two hard vertices is possible , and the integration over @xmath30 is instrumental in getting rid of a fake singularity of the scattering matrix element ( a simple explanation of the origin of this unphysical singularity can be found in @xcite , see also @xcite ) .    as a result , a small offset between the parton longitudinal momenta in the w.f .  and w.f.c .",
    "emerges , @xmath31 .",
    "however , this mismatch turns out to be negligible in the dominant kinematical region where the squared total transverse momentum @xmath32 of the jet pair is much smaller than the overall hardness @xmath16 of the process : @xmath33 .",
    "as noticed by gaunt @xcite , the non - diagonality in the longitudinal momentum space is likely to get induced in 2  processes by higher order qcd effects .",
    "this happens when incoming partons , in the w.f .  and w.f.c .",
    ", exchange ( real or virtual ) gluons with transverse momenta in the interval @xmath34 . in @xcite arguments",
    "were raised in favor of smallness of the crosstalk effects in the dpi cross section .",
    "otherwise , this would have led to unwelcome complication of the problem : one would be forced to deal with an unknown function of _ four _ longitudinal momentum fractions ( three independent variables ) in place of the two of @xmath35 .",
    "hence for the time being we disregard this complication .",
    "we do not dwell into potential non - diagonality in color and in spin variables either .",
    "one may argue that such non - diagonal configurations are likely to be suppressed as they can be related with form factors for proton transition between two states with different quantum numbers of the proton constituents .",
    "for example , swapping inside the proton the colors of two partons that sit at distances of the order of the nucleon radius , corresponds to excitation that can be visualized as adding an extra piece of color string whose energy , @xmath36 , would excite and destroy the proton .",
    "in @xcite we have developed a formalism to address the problem of multi - parton interactions .",
    "qft description of double hard parton collisions calls for introduction of a new object  _ the generalized two - parton distribution _ , @xmath37gpd .",
    "defined in the momentum space , it characterizes two - parton correlations inside hadron  @xcite : @xmath38 here the index @xmath39 refers to the hadron , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the light - cone fractions of the parton momenta , and @xmath40 the corresponding hard scales .",
    "as has been mention above , the two - dimensional vector @xmath9 is fourier conjugate to the relative distance between the partons @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the impact parameter plane .",
    "the distribution obviously depends on the parton species ; we suppress the corresponding indices for brevity .",
    "the double hard interaction cross section ( and , in particular , that of production of two dijets ) can be expressed through the generalized two - parton distributions @xmath37gpd .",
    "@xmath8s enter the expressions for the differential distributions in the jet transverse momentum imbalances @xmath43 in the kinematical region , as well as for the `` total '' dpi cross section ( integrated over @xmath43 ) . in the latter case the hardness parameters of the @xmath8s are given by the jet transverse momenta @xmath44 , while in the differential distributions  by the imbalances @xmath45 themselves .",
    "the corresponding formulae derived in the leading collinear approximation of pqcd can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the dpi cross section _ does not factorize _ into the product of the hard parton interaction cross sections and the two two - parton distributions depending on momentum fractions @xmath7 and the hard scales , @xmath46 . instead ,    [ eq : xss ] & = & , + 1 _ & & .",
    "the _ effective interaction area _",
    "@xmath47 is given by the convolution of the @xmath8s of incident hadrons over the transverse momentum parameter @xmath21 normalized by the product of single - parton inclusive pdfs .",
    "for expression for the dpi cross section to make sense , the integral over @xmath10 has to be convergent .",
    "this is well the case when the two partons are taken from the non - perturbative ( np ) proton wave function .",
    "indeed , a typical inter - parton distance in the proton is large , of the order of the hadron size @xmath48 .",
    "accordingly , one expects the corresponding correlator in the momentum space to be concentrated at a finite np scale @xmath49 and to fall fast at large @xmath50 ( exponentially or as a sufficiently high power of @xmath10 ) .",
    "however , there is another source of two - parton correlations .",
    "this is purely perturbative ( pt ) mechanism when the two partons emerge from _ perturbative splitting _ of one parton taken from the hadron wave function . in this scenario",
    "the production of the parton pair is concentrated at much smaller distances . as a result",
    ", the corresponding contribution to @xmath37gpd turns out to be practically independent on @xmath50 in a broad range , up to the hard scale(s ) characterizing the hard process under consideration ( @xmath50 only affects the lower limit of transverse momentum integrals in the parton cascades , causing but a mild logarithmic dependence )",
    ".    given essentially different dependence on @xmath10 , one has to treat the two contributions separately by casting the @xmath37gpd as a sum of two terms : [ eq:2terms ]    d_h ( x_1,x_2 , q_1 ^ 2,q_2 ^ 2 ; ) & = _ [ 2]d_h(x_1,x_2 , q_1 ^ 2,q_2 ^ 2 ; ) & + _ [ 1]d_h(x_1,x_2 , q_1 ^ 2,q_2 ^ 2 ; ) .",
    "here subscripts @xmath51}d$ ] and @xmath52}d$ ] mark the first and the second mechanisms , correspondingly : two partons from the wave function versus one parton that perturbatively splits into two .",
    "in this section we discuss the role of the pt parton correlations and show that , given a sufficiently large scale of hard interactions , they turn out to be as important as np ones .",
    "let us chose a scale @xmath53 that separates np and pt physics to be sufficiently low , so that parton cascades due to evolution between @xmath53 and @xmath44 are well developed . to get a feeling of relative importance of the pt correlation , as well as to understand its dependence on @xmath15 and the ratio of scales , @xmath16 vs.  @xmath53 , the following lowest order pt estimate can be used .",
    "imagine that at the scale @xmath53 the nucleon consisted of @xmath54 quarks and @xmath55 gluons ( `` valence partons '' ) with relatively large longitudinal momenta , so that triggered partons with @xmath56 resulted necessarily from pt evolution .",
    "in the first logarithmic order , @xmath57 , the inclusive spectrum can be represented as @xmath58 where we suppressed @xmath15-dependence as irrelevant . if both gluons originate from the same `` valence '' parton , then    [ eq:1d ] _ [ 1]d 12n_cd + ( n_qc_f^2 + n_gn_c^2)^2 , while independent sources give @xmath51}\\!d$ ] : [ eq:2d ]    & ( n_q(n_q-1)c_f^2 + 2n_qn_gc_fn_c + n_g(n_g-1)n_c^2)^2 & = d^2 - ( n_qc_f^2 + n_gn_c^2)^2 .",
    "recall that the @xmath10-dependence is different in and .",
    "however , at @xmath59 the second terms cancel in the sum and we get for the correlator [ eq : corrmodel ] -1 .",
    "the correlation is driven by the gluon cascade - the first term in  and is not small ( being of the order of unity ) .",
    "it gets diluted when the number of independent `` valence sources '' at the scale @xmath53 increases .",
    "this happens , obviously , when @xmath7 are taken smaller . on the other hand , for large @xmath60 and increasing ,",
    "the effective number of more energetic partons in the nucleon is about 2 and decreasing , so that the relative importance of the 2 processes grows .",
    "we conclude that the relative size of pt correlations is of order one , provided @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , the pt parton correlations can not be disregarded without running a risk of violating general principles .",
    "this can be illustrated by looking at the momentum sum rule for double parton distributions .",
    "an obvious momentum sum rule should be satisfied .",
    "namely , that the integral over @xmath62 with the weight @xmath24 ( summing over all parton species ) should produce in the end @xmath63 times the inclusive one - parton distribution @xmath64 , that is , the total longitudinal momentum carried by all the partons but the triggered one : [ eq : momsum ]    _ i_2 & dx_2 x_2 d^(i_1,i_2)_h(x_1,x_2 , q_1 ^ 2,q_2 ^ 2 ; = 0 ) & = ( 1-x_1 ) d_h^i_1(x_1 , q_1 ^ 2 )    ( here we have explicitly restored the parton species indices @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) .",
    "this sum rule , together with other ones concerning valence quantum numbers , has been discussed by gaunt and stirling in @xcite as means for restricting the form of double parton distributions . setting the @xmath10 argument of @xmath8 to @xmath59",
    "corresponds to taking integral over the relative transverse distance between partons in the proton .",
    "derivation of is carried out in appendix  [ sec : momentum ] .",
    "it explicitly demonstrates that the pt parton splitting enters on equal grounds with the contribution due to two partons taken both from the initial np hadron wave function .",
    "actually , the np and pt contributions _ do not _ enter the physical dpi cross section in arithmetic sum , driving one even farther from the familiar factorization picture based on universal ( process independent ) parton distributions . as explained in @xcite , a double hard interaction of two pairs of partons that _ both _ originate from pt splitting of a single parton from each of the colliding hadrons ,",
    "does not produce back - to - back dijets .",
    "in fact , such an eventuality corresponds to a one - loop correction to the usual @xmath67 jet production process and should not be looked upon as multi - parton interaction .",
    "the term @xmath52}d_{h_1}\\times { } _ { [ 1]}d_{h_2}$ ] has to be excluded from the product @xmath68 , the conclusion we share with gaunt and stirling @xcite .",
    "so , we are left with two sources of genuine two - parton interactions : four - parton collisions described by the product of ( pt - evolved ) @xmath37gpds of np origin ( 2 ) ,    [ eq:2212 ] [ eq:22 ] _ [ 2]d_h_1(x_1,x_2 , q_1 ^ 2,q_2 ^ 2 ; ) _ [ 2]d_h_2(x_3,x_4 , q_1 ^ 2,q_2 ^ 2 ; - ) , and three - parton collisions due to an interplay between the np two - parton correlation in one hadron and the two partons emerging from a pt parton splitting in another hadron ( 2  ) , described by the combination [ eq:12 ]    & _ [ 2]d_h_1 ( x_1,x_2 , q_1 ^ 2,q_2 ^ 2 ; ) _ [ 1]d_h_2 ( x_3,x_4 , q_1 ^ 2,q_2 ^ 2 ; - ) + & _ [ 1]d_h_1 ( x_1,x_2 , q_1 ^ 2,q_2 ^ 2 ; ) _ [ 2]d_h_2(x_3,x_4 , q_1 ^ 2,q_2 ^ 2;- ) .",
    "given that @xmath69}\\!d$ ] falls fast at large @xmath10 , a mild logarithmic @xmath10-dependence of @xmath52}d$ ] can be neglected in the product in .",
    "separation of pt and np contributions is a delicate issue . by definition of the _ perturbative _ correlation function , @xmath52}d$ ]",
    "vanishes when @xmath72 , @xmath73 are taken equal to the separation scale @xmath53 that one chooses to set the lower limit for applicability of pqcd calculations .",
    "strictly speaking , @xmath53 can be chosen arbitrarily : both the np input function @xmath69}\\!d$ ] and the pt - calculable correlation @xmath52}d$ ] contain @xmath53-dependence , but their sum does not depend on this formal parameter . at the same time , the character of the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath69}\\!d$ ] depends , obviously , on the choice of the @xmath53 scale . indeed , by increasing the value of @xmath53 one will shuffle a part of the perturbative splitting contribution from @xmath74}\\!d$ ] into @xmath69}\\!d$ ] .",
    "as a result , the `` np correlator '' @xmath69}\\!d$ ] , contaminated by a short range pt correlation , would acquire a `` tail '' at large @xmath50 which would spoil convergence of the @xmath10 integration in .",
    "thus , in order to preserve the logic of the np  pt separation , one is led to introduce a specific resolution scale , @xmath75 , at which scale the np correlation @xmath69}\\!d$ ] falls fast with increase of @xmath50 .",
    "so defined , @xmath71 is no longer an arbitrary `` factorization scale '' but a _ phenomenological parameter _ whose value ( which one expects to be of order of @xmath76 ) should be established from the data .      in order to derive the dpi cross section , one has to start with examination of the double differential transverse momentum distribution and then integrate it over jet imbalances @xmath77 .",
    "why this step is necessary ?",
    "the parton distribution @xmath78  the core object of the qcd - modified parton model  arises upon logarithmic integration over the transverse momentum up to the hard scale , @xmath79 .",
    "analogously , the double parton distribution @xmath80 embeds _",
    "independent integrations _ over parton transverse momenta @xmath81 , @xmath82 up to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "however , the 2  dpi cross section contains a specific contribution ( `` short split '' , see below ) in which the transverse momenta of the partons 1 and 2 are strongly correlated ( nearly opposite ) .",
    "this pattern does not fit into the structure of the pqcd evolution equation for @xmath70 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 change independently .",
    "given this subtlety , a legitimate question arises whether the expression for the integrated 2  cross section based on the notion of the two - parton distribution @xmath74}\\!d$ ] takes the short split into account .",
    "below we demonstrate that in fact it does .",
    "the differential distribution over jet imbalances was derived in @xcite in the leading collinear approximation of pqcd .",
    "it resembles the `` ddt formula '' for the drell - yan spectrum @xcite and contains two derivatives of the product of @xmath8s that depend on the corresponding @xmath77 as hardness scales , and the proper sudakov form factors depending on ( the ratio of ) the @xmath44 and @xmath85 .",
    "in particular , in the region of _ strongly ordered _ imbalances , [ eq : dlog1 ] ; _ 13 ^ 2 _ 24 ^ 2 , _ 13 ^ 2 _ 24 ^ 2 , the differential 2  cross section reads    [ eq : ddt31 ] & = & \\ { _ [ 1]d_h_1(x_1,x_2,_13 ^ 2,_24 ^ 2 ; ) _ [ 2]d_h_2(x_3,x_4,_13 ^ 2 , _ 24 ^ 2 ; ) + & & s_1(q_1 ^ 2,_13 ^ 2 ) s_3(q_1 ^ 2,_13 ^ 2 ) s_2(q_2 ^ 2,_24 ^ 2 ) s_4(q_2 ^ 2,_24 ^ 2 ) } + \\ { h_1 h_2 } .",
    "the differential distribution for the 2  dpi mechanism has a similar structure , see eq .",
    "( 25 ) of @xcite .",
    "in addition to , there is another source of double collinear enhancement in the differential 2  cross section .",
    "it is due to the kinematical region where the two imbalances nearly compensate one another , [ eq : deltaprime ] ^2 = ( _ 13 + _",
    "24)^2 ^2 = _ 13 ^ 2_24 ^ 2 , and the dominant integration region is complementary to that of : [ eq : dlog2 ] ; ^2 ^2 .",
    "this enhancement characterizes the set of 2   graphs in which there is no accompanying radiation with transverse momenta exceeding @xmath86 .",
    "in this situation , the parton that compensates the overall imbalance , @xmath87 is radiated off the incoming , quasi - real , parton legs as shown in fig .",
    "[ figshortkin ] . at the same time , the virtual partons after the core splitting `` 0''@xmath88 `` 1''+``2 '' enter their respective hard collisions without radiating any offspring on the way .",
    "the @xmath89 splitting neighbors the hard vertices , therefore the name `` short split '' ( aka `` endpoint contribution '' , @xcite ) .",
    "a closed expression for the differential distribution in jet imbalances due to short split , derived in the leading collinear approximation , is given by eq .",
    "( 27 ) of @xcite :    [ eq : ddt32 ]    & = _ c p_c^(1,2 ) ( ) s_1(q_1 ^ 2,^2 ) s_2(q_2 ^ 2,^2 ) & \\ { s_c(^2,^2 ) s_3(q_1 ^ 2 , ^2 ) s_4(q_2 ^ 2,^2 ) _ [ 2]d_h_2(x_3,x_4,^2 , ^2 ; ) } + \\ { h_1 h_2 } .",
    "the short split becomes less important when the scales of the two hard collisions separate .",
    "indeed , the logarithmic integration over @xmath32 is kinematically restricted from above , @xmath90 . as a result ,",
    "when transverse momenta of jets in one pair much exceed those of the second pair , e.g. , @xmath91 ( see ) , the contribution of the short split becomes suppressed as @xmath92 here @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the double logarithmic sudakov form factors of the partons `` 1 '' and `` 3 '' that enter the hard interaction with the larger hardness scale .",
    "short split induces a strong correlation between jet imbalances which is worth trying to look for experimentally .",
    "the relative weight of the short split depends on the process under consideration . for most dpi processes in the kinematical region",
    "we have studied , it typically provides 1015%  of the @xmath48 value .",
    "however , it happens to be more important when the nature of the process favors parton splitting .",
    "this is markedly the case of the double drell - yan pair production where the short split contribution reaches 3035% . on the contrary",
    ", it turns out to be practically negligible for the same - sign double @xmath2-meson production ( see discussion in the conclusions section below ) .      in the preceding publication",

    "<S> we examine the role played in double parton interactions ( dpi ) by the parton  parton correlations originating from perturbative qcd parton splittings . also presented </S>",
    "<S> are the results of the numerical analysis of the integrated dpi cross sections at tevatron and lhc energies . to obtain the numerical results the knowledge of the single - parton gpds gained by the hera experiments was used to construct the non - perturbative input for _ generalized double parton distributions_. the perturbative two - parton correlations induced by three - parton interactions contribute significantly to resolution of the longstanding puzzle of an excess of multi - jet production events in the back - to - back kinematics observed at the tevatron . </S>"
