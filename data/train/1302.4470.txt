    "a homomorphism from a graph @xmath0 to a graph @xmath1 is map @xmath2 which preserves adjacency , i.e.  @xmath3 is adjacent to @xmath4 whenever @xmath5 is adjacent to @xmath6 .",
    "a _ core _ of a graph @xmath0 is a vertex - minimal subgraph to which @xmath0 admits a homomorphism .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to show that all cores of a graph are isomorphic , and therefore we sometimes refer to _ the _ core of a graph . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with vertex transitive graphs , i.e.  graphs whose automorphism groups act transitively on their vertex sets .",
    "this paper is motivated by a comment once made by my algebraic graph theory instructor who said that he does not know of any interesting examples of vertex transitive graphs that are neither cores nor have complete graphs as their cores . by this",
    "he meant that all other examples of vertex transitive graphs seem to simply be constructed by taking several copies of some vertex transitive core and then adding some edges between these copies .",
    "this remark motivates the question of when a vertex transitive graph can be partitioned into copies of its core , to which we are able to give a partial answer .",
    "in particular , we will show that such a partition exists for a subclass of cayley graphs known as normal cayley graphs , as well as for any vertex transitive graph whose core is half its size . as a bonus ,",
    "the techniques developed for dealing with the normal cayley graph case can be used to give an alternative proof of theorem  [ vtxtranscores ] below , which was originally proven in @xcite .",
    "in order to partition a graph into copies of its core , we must at least have that the size of the core divides the size of the graph .",
    "fortunately , this is the case for all vertex transitive graphs , and in fact we have the following stronger statement from @xcite",
    ".    theoremfibres[vtxtranscores ] if @xmath0 is a vertex transitive graph and @xmath7 is an endomorphism of @xmath0 whose image is a core @xmath1 of @xmath0 , then all of the fibres @xmath8 , @xmath9 , have the same size and thus @xmath10 divides @xmath11 .",
    "note that an endomorphism is simply a homomorphism from a graph to itself , and a fibre of a homomorphism is the inverse image of a vertex .",
    "typically , the term ` fibre ' is used to specifically refer to preimages of vertices contained in the image of a homomorphism , i.e.  nonempty preimages .",
    "below , we will frequently use the notion of a _ retraction _ , which is an endomorphism that is identity on its image .",
    "the image of a retraction is known as a _ retract _ , and it is not difficult to see that a core of a graph is always a retract .",

    "is often referred to as the _ connection set_. a cayley graph is _ normal _ if its connection set is closed under conjugation by any group element , i.e.   @xmath19 for all @xmath20 . when studying vertex transitive graphs , cayley graphs are a natural class to consider since every vertex transitive graph is a retract of some cayley graph  @xcite .    for a cayley graph @xmath21 and fixed element @xmath22 ,",
    "the map @xmath23 for all @xmath20 is an automorphism of @xmath0 known as a left translation .",

    "in fact , an equivalent definition of normal cayley graph is that the right translations are automorphisms .    to prove our main result concerning normal cayley graphs",
    ", we will need the following two lemmas which will also allow us to give a new proof of theorem  [ vtxtranscores ] .",

    "note that this is an automorphism of @xmath0 since it is a left translation .",
    "however , @xmath43 and @xmath44 by the above .",
    "but this contradicts lemma  [ orbitals ] , since @xmath45 and both @xmath46 and @xmath47 appear in @xmath1 .",
    "we are now ready to show that normal cayley graphs can always be partitioned into copies of their cores .",

    "let @xmath0 be a normal cayley graph and @xmath1 be a core of @xmath0 .",

    "furthermore , since @xmath0 is normal , right translations are automorphisms , and therefore each set @xmath36 , for @xmath55 , induces a copy of @xmath1 .     some of the ideas in the above proof are inspired by the proofs of theorem  6.1.1 and corollaries  6.1.2 and 6.1.3 in @xcite .",
    "given the result of theorem  [ vtxtranscores ] , it is natural to ask what can be said about vertex transitive graphs whose cores are half their size , since this is in some sense the simplest nontrivial case .",
    "it turns out that any such vertex transitive graph can be partitioned into two copies of its core .",
    "the proof uses the fact that the core of a vertex transitive graph is vertex transitive , a proof of which can be found in @xcite or @xcite",
    ". we will use @xmath56 to denote that vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 are adjacent in graph @xmath0 , though we will often omit the subscript when it is clear from context .",
    "we use @xmath57 to denote that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are isomorphic graphs .",
    "[ halfsize ] suppose @xmath0 is a vertex transitive graph with a core @xmath58 such that @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath60 be a retraction onto @xmath58 , and let @xmath61 be the subgraph of @xmath0 induced by the vertices @xmath62 . if @xmath1 is the bipartite graph consisting of the edges of @xmath0 which have exactly one end in each of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , then we have the following :    1 .",

    "@xmath66 is an isomorphism from @xmath61 to @xmath58 .",

    "let @xmath47 and @xmath69 be the degree of vertices in @xmath0 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "this means that the @xmath63 side of @xmath1 is regular with degree @xmath70 .",
    "since the fibres of @xmath7 all have the same size , namely two , the restriction of @xmath7 to @xmath61 is a bijection between the vertices of @xmath61 and @xmath58 that preserves adjacency and therefore @xmath61 is isomorphic to a spanning subgraph of @xmath58 .",
    "so the degree of any vertex in @xmath61 is at most @xmath69 and thus the degree in @xmath1 of a vertex in @xmath64 is at least @xmath70 .",
    "but of course this means that the degree in @xmath1 of every vertex in @xmath64 is exactly @xmath71 since the sum of the degrees on one side of a bipartite graph is equal to the sum of the degrees on the other side .",
    "therefore @xmath61 is regular with degree @xmath69 and thus must be isomorphic to @xmath58 , and furthermore , the restriction of @xmath7 to @xmath61 is an isomoprhism from @xmath61 to @xmath58 .",
    "note that we have already shown that @xmath1 is regular with degree @xmath71 .",
    "hence , all that is left to show is that the edges of @xmath1 have the appropriate form . consider a vertex @xmath72 which is adjacent in @xmath0 to a vertex @xmath73 . since @xmath7 is a retraction , @xmath74 .",
    "however , since the restriction of @xmath7 to @xmath61 is an isomorphism , if @xmath75 is such that @xmath76 , then @xmath77 in @xmath61 .",
    "the partition given in the above proof actually satisfies another interesting property ; it is equitable .",
    "a partition @xmath78 of the vertex set of a graph @xmath0 is said to be _ equitable _ if for all @xmath79 $ ] , the number of neighbors a vertex of @xmath50 has in @xmath80 depends only on @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "given such a partition , its _ quotient matrix _ is the matrix whose @xmath83-entry is the number of neighbors a vertex of @xmath50 has in @xmath80 .",
    "it turns out that the eigenvalues of the quotient matrix of an equitable partition of a graph @xmath0 , are all also eigenvalues of ( the adjacency matrix of ) @xmath0 . from this and the above proof",
    "we obtain the following corollary .",
    "let @xmath0 be a vertex transitive graph with a core @xmath58 such that @xmath59 , and let @xmath61 be the induced subgraph of @xmath0 with vertex set @xmath62 .",
    "then @xmath84 is an equitable partition of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath47 is the valency of @xmath0 and @xmath69 is the valency of @xmath58 , then @xmath85 is an eigenvalue of of @xmath0 .    _",
    "_ the fact that @xmath84 is an equitable partition is obvious from the above proof . since it is an equitable partition , the eigenvalues of its quotient matrix are eigenvalues of @xmath0 . as can also be easily seen from above , the quotient matrix of this equitable partition is @xmath86 the eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath47 and @xmath87 .",
    "a consequence of this corollary is that if a vertex transitive graph on @xmath88 vertices for @xmath89 a prime is not bipartite and has no nonnegative integer eigenvalue of the same parity as its valency , then it is its own core .",
    "it would be nice to be able to more precisely describe what the subgraph @xmath1 in the above proof looks like .",
    "for instance , is it necessarily vertex transitive ?",
    "a more precise description of @xmath1 could lead to a complete characterization of when a graph @xmath0 is vertex transitive with a core of half its size .      in light of the above result",
    ", the obvious next step would be to attempt to generalize the argument to vertex transitive graphs with cores of smaller relative size .",
    "the first obstacle one runs into with this is that it is not obvious how to choose the partition . in the above",
    ", each fibre of the retraction onto the core had size two , and therefore one can choose the image of the retraction as one part of the partition , and the remaining vertices for the other part .",
    "in the more general case , there are many more possibilities for choosing the partition .",
    "the second obstacle one runs into while trying to generalize the above result is that it is simply not true . for a counterexample",
    ", one can consider the line graph of @xmath90 , denoted @xmath91 , for @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath90 has maximum degree @xmath93 and can be @xmath94-edge - colored , the graph @xmath91 contains a clique of size @xmath93 and can be @xmath94-colored .",
    "thus there are homomorphisms between @xmath91 and @xmath95 in both directions .",
    "two such graphs are said to be _ homomorphically equivalent _ , which implies that they have isomorphic cores , in this case @xmath95 .",
    "however , since @xmath92 , it is not hard to see that any clique of size @xmath93 in @xmath91 corresponds to the set of edges incident to a particular vertex in @xmath90 , and thus any two such cliques must share a vertex .",
    "therefore , @xmath91 can not be partitioned into copies of its core . since @xmath96",
    ", these graphs provide counterexamples to generalizing the above to any relative size smaller than @xmath97 .",
    "we say that a graph @xmath0 is _ arc transitive _ if for any two ordered pairs of vertices @xmath98 and @xmath99 such that @xmath77 and @xmath100 , there exists an automorphism , @xmath33 , of @xmath0 such that @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "it is easy to see that any arc transitive graph ( without isolated vertices ) is vertex transitive as well . as with vertex transitive graphs ,",
    "the core of an arc transitive graph must be arc transitive as well .",
    "furthermore , by a result in @xcite , the valency of an arc transitive graph is always divisible by the valency of its core .",
    "if we assume that the graph @xmath0 in theorem[halfsize ] is also arc transitive , then we can obtain even more specific results about its structure .    first , note that the graph @xmath1 in the proof of theorem  [ halfsize ] has degree at most @xmath69 and therefore @xmath0 has degree @xmath103 . since @xmath69 must divide @xmath47",
    ", this implies that either @xmath104 or @xmath105 . in the former case @xmath0",
    "is simply two disjoint copies of @xmath58 , and in the latter case @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "therefore , an arc transitive graph has a core half its size if and only if it is either two disjoint copies of an arc transitive core , or is the lexicographic product of an arc transitive core and @xmath107 .",
    "here we present a new proof of theorem  [ vtxtranscores ] which uses the techniques of section  [ normal ] .",
    "the proof uses what is known as the lexicographic product of a graph @xmath0 with a graph @xmath1 .",
    "this product is denoted @xmath108 $ ] , and is the graph with vertex set @xmath109 and @xmath110 if either ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) or @xmath113 .",
    "the special case of @xmath1 being empty , i.e.  @xmath114 $ ] , is known as a _",
    "multiple _ of @xmath0 .",
    "multiple \" of @xmath0 is obtained by replacing every vertex of @xmath0 with an independent set of size @xmath115 and having all possible edges between two such independent sets corresponding to adjacent vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , any multiple of @xmath0 contains a subgraph isomorphic to @xmath0 , and the map which takes each independent set corresponding to a vertex of @xmath0 to that vertex of @xmath0 is a homomorphism to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 is homomorphically equivalent to any of its multiples and thus they all have the same core .    a well - known theorem by sabidussi  @xcite states that",
    "if @xmath0 is vertex transitive , then some multiple of @xmath0 is a cayley graph .",
    "it is this theorem that allows us to give an alternative proof to theorem  [ vtxtranscores ] .",
    "_ we first prove it for cayley graphs .",
    "suppose that @xmath21 is a cayley graph , and @xmath7 is an endomorphism onto a core @xmath1 of @xmath0 .",
    "then for any @xmath9 , the sets @xmath36 , for @xmath37 , are mutually disjoint by lemma  [ cayley ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath116 is true for all @xmath9 .",
    "however , the average size of a fibre of @xmath7 is clearly @xmath53 , and thus we must have equality in the above inequality for all @xmath9 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath0 is a vertex transitive graph and @xmath7 is an endomorphism whose image is a core @xmath1 of @xmath0 . by the result of sabidussi mentioned above",

    "the vertices of @xmath119 are of the form @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "the map @xmath34 given by @xmath123 is easily seen to be a retraction onto a subgraph @xmath124 of @xmath119 isomorphic to @xmath0 . if we define a map @xmath125 by @xmath126 , then @xmath127 is an endomorphism of @xmath119 onto a subgraph @xmath128 isomorphic to @xmath1 , and is thus an endomorphism onto a core of @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , by the first part of the proof , the fibres of @xmath127 all have the same size .",
    "however , each fibre of @xmath127 clearly has size @xmath115 times the size of the corresponding fibre of @xmath7 , and therefore all fibres of @xmath7 must have the same size .",
    "this paper is a step towards fully describing the structure of vertex transitive graphs in terms of their cores . in the special cases of normal cayley graphs and vertex transitive graphs with cores half their size , our results hint torward a product structure for these classes of graphs .",
    "the examples of @xmath91 show us that not all vertex transitive graphs fit this description , and thus some more general result would be required to describe all vertex transitive graphs in terms of their cores .",

    "another question of interest is when a the _ edge _ set of a vertex transitive graph can be partitioned into copies of its core .",
    "a necessary condition for this is that the valency of the core must divide the valency of the graph , and thus arc transitive graphs are a natural class of graphs to consider with respect to this question .",
