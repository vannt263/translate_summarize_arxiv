    "folding of biopolymers is a fundamental process in molecular biology without which life as we know it would not be possible . in biopolymer folding ,",
    "well - characterized interactions between individual monomers make a polymer fold into a specific structure believed to minimize the total interaction free energy . the apparent simplicity in the formulation of this biopolymer folding problem is in sharp contrast with the immense challenges faced in actually describing biopolymer folding quantitatively caused by the intricate interplay of monomer - monomer interactions and the constraint that the monomers are connected into a chain of a certain sequence .",
    "the biological importance of biopolymer folding paired with this immense intellectual challenge has sparked numerous computational and theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "these studies do not only attempt quantitative predictions of specific structures but also focus on more fundamental properties of the biopolymer folding problem such as its phase diagram .",
    "while the bulk of the work concentrates on the folding of proteins due to its overwhelming importance in pharmaceutical applications , recently rna folding has been identified as an ideal model system for biopolymer folding  @xcite .",
    "rna is a biopolymer of four different bases g , c , a , and u. the most important interaction among these bases is the formation of watson - crick(wc ) base pairs , i.e. , a  u and g  c pairs .",
    "this comparatively simple interaction scheme makes the rna folding problem very amenable to theoretical approaches without losing the overall flavor of the general biopolymer folding problem .",
    "again , a lot of effort has been devoted to understanding fundamental properties of rna folding such as the different thermodynamic phases an ensemble of rna molecules can be in as a function of temperature , an external force acting on the molecules , and the sequence design  @xcite .",
    "all these theoretical approaches are concerned with the phase behavior of rna molecules in the _",
    "thermodynamic limit_. in order to compare these theoretical predictions with numerical or actual biological experiments it is thus important to know which role _ finite size effects _ play , i.e. , at which size of a molecule the universal predictions of the asymptotic theories are expected to hold . in this publication",
    "we precisely aim to answer this question .",
    "we study homogeneous rna sequences which allows us to _ analytically _ solve for the universal asymptotic behavior as well as the cross - over length below which the universal theory is not applicable any more .",
    "we find that this cross - over length is very strongly dependent on the sequence of the molecule . for realistic energy parameters",
    "we find that the cross - over length can be as large as 10,000 bases .",
    "this is about the largest size of naturally occurring rnas as well as the largest length of rna molecules amenable to quantitative computational approaches .",
    "thus , we conclude that finite size effects have to be seriously taken into account when describing rna folding by asymptotic theories .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the definition of rna secondary structure . in sec .",
    "iii , we analytically derive the finite size effects of the simplest model of rna folding namely a homogeneous sequence without loop entropies . while this model is mainly treated for pedagogical purposes , in sec .",
    "iv , we sketch how the result can be generalized to more realistic models of rna folding . in sec .",
    "v , the behavior of the cross - over length @xmath0 is discussed .",
    "we find that @xmath0 depends mostly on the degree of branching of the rna molecules and a simple approximate formula is derived .",
    "these results are shown to be consistent with the numerical values obtained using experimentally known energy parameters for specific sequences in sec .",
    "we point out how enormous finite size effects in the rna secondary structure formation problem can be .",
    "the detailed derivations of the partition function and the cross - over length are relegated to various appendices .",
    "rna usually occurs as a single - stranded polymer with four types of monomers ( bases ) g , c , a , and u. the strand can bend back onto itself and form helices consisting of stacks of stable watson - crick pairs ( a with u or g with c ) .        an rna secondary structure describes which bases are bound and can be written as a set of binding pairs @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the @xmath4 and @xmath5 base of the rna polymer respectively .",
    "for example , the secondary structure * s * of fig .  [ ss ] is written as @xmath6    in this study , we apply the common approximation to exclude the so - called pseudo - knots  @xcite , i.e. , for two base pairs @xmath1 and @xmath7 , the configurations @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not allowed . as a result ,",
    "the analytical studies become more tractable .",
    "this exclusion of pseudo - knots is reasonable . for long pseudo - knots ,",
    "the double helix structure would require threading one end of the molecule through its loops many times so they are kinetically difficult to form .",
    "thus , these pseudo - knots occur infrequently in natural rna structures  @xcite . short pseudo - knots , on the other hand , do not contribute much to the total free energy because of the relatively low binding energies for short sequences and the strong electrostatic repulsion of the backbone since the polymer backbone is highly charged . by excluding pseudo - knots , we will stay close to commonly used algorithms that compute the exact partition function which can be applied to test our model .",
    "since the tertiary interactions between structures are in general much weaker than the interactions among the secondary structures  @xcite , we will follow the common approaches and take into account only the energy contribution from the secondary structures .",
    "if we assign a gibbs free energy @xmath10 to each secondary structure * s * , the partition function of the ensemble of all structures is given by @xmath11    the gibbs free energy is commonly used to describe the secondary structure since it contains entropic contributions from the formation of loops as well as enthalpic terms from the formation of base pairs .",
    "the total free energy @xmath12 is the sum of the energy contributed from each elementary piece such as the stacking of base pairs and the connecting loops .",
    "the largest contribution are the stacking energies between adjacent wc pairs , and these energies depend on the type of bases in the pairs . while the typical value of the stacking energy is on the order of @xmath13 at room temperature , both the enthalpic and entropic terms are on the order of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the stacking energy will become repulsive with a moderate increase of temperature to around @xmath15 and the rna molecule denatures .",
    "in order to get a qualitative understanding of finite size effects , we first follow previous works  @xcite and assume that the gibbs free energy is the sum of the binding free energies @xmath16 of each base pair in the structure , @xmath17 and neglect the entropic energies due to the formation of loops for the rest of this section .    the binding free energies @xmath16 in this model are differences between the gain in chemical binding energy and the loss in the configurational entropy associated with the formation of the base pairs .",
    "since both contributions are large and comparable , the realistic values of the @xmath16 strongly depend on temperature .",
    "since we do not describe spatial degrees of freedom in this model , it does not describe denaturation of the rna molecule and we restrict ourselves from here on to a parameter regime where the majority of the bases is paired , i.e. , where a significant fraction of the @xmath16 is negative .    in order to obtain analytical insights into the finite size effects ,",
    "we additionally assume that the binding free energy @xmath16 is a constant @xmath18 , independent of the identities of the bases .",
    "thus , in our simplified model @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for the number of pairs in * s*. this simplified energy model serves as the basis of our study for the more realistic energy model .",
    "as it stands , this energy model and the more realistic energy model we will introduce later describe only homogeneous sequences .",
    "however , it has been argued that this energy model can be applied to random rna sequences at high enough temperature when the disorder is sufficiently weak  @xcite . under this weak disorder , there exist many structures with nearly degenerate energies and the corresponding scaling laws match the predictions of the simplified energy model .",
    "only as the temperature is lowered , a strong disorder phase arises .",
    "this low temperature phase is characterized by a small number of distinct low - energy structures , and is referred to as the `` glass phase '' in analogy with studies of other disorder system .",
    "however , this glass phase is not within the scope of this article .",
    "the partition function of the molten phase model can be obtained through the recursive relation in fig .",
    "[ molten ] .",
    "this figure shows how the possible ways of binding can be decomposed into two cases where the last base n is either unbound or bound to some base k. if we define @xmath21 as the partition function of an rna of length n , the relation reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "together with the boundary condition @xmath24 , this equation allows calculation of the exact value of the partition function @xmath25 in @xmath26 time .",
    "the vienna package  @xcite is able to calculate this exact value with more complete sequence dependent energy parameters based on the similar scheme .",
    "this recursive equation  ( 3 ) also leads us to the analytical expression for the partition function . by introducing the z - transform , @xmath27 and applying it to eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we get a quadratic equation for @xmath28 as @xmath29 from which @xmath28 can be solved . for large sequence lengths ,",
    "the partition function @xmath25 is obtained by performing the inverse z - transform on @xmath28 , and can be approximated ( see appendix a ) as @xmath30,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the branch point of @xmath28 , @xmath32 , @xmath33^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath34 .",
    "this asymptotic analytical formula is only determined by the behavior of @xmath28 near the branch point @xmath35 .",
    "the exponent @xmath32 indicates the characteristic universal behavior of this partition function for long sequences . the non - universal cross - over length @xmath36 characterizes how long a sequence has to be for the universal laws to hold . here",
    ", we find an explicit analytical formula for @xmath0 as a function of parameter q.    from the formula of @xmath36 , we can see that the cross - over length in this simple model is on the order of 1 for all values of q. however , in the following sections we will show that the cross - over length may vary over several order of magnitudes from several bases to 1,000,000 bases .",
    "thus , the loop entropies of the more realistic energy model would greatly modify the behavior of cross - over length .",
    "to get a more quantitative understanding of the cross - over length , we now take into account the loop entropies and introduce boltzmann factors , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath2 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , for the different types of loops ( see fig .",
    "the values of these free energy parameters have been carefully measured  @xcite such that our model can be applied quantitatively to realistic rna molecules . typically , the free energy of a stacking loop is large and negative ( @xmath41 ) while the free energies for all the other loops tend to be large and positive , leading to boltzmann factors much less than one .",
    "the binding energy @xmath18 of the simple model introduced above is now absorbed into these loop free energies . as mentioned in sec .",
    "iii , we still restrict ourselves to a temperature regime below denaturation which is determined by the true energy model .",
    "again , we want to calculate the partition function of the structure ensemble and derive the cross - over length as a function of the loop parameters .",
    "this calculation in principle follows along the lines of sec .",
    "iii , but is technically much more elaborate because of the more complicated energy model .",
    "a reader more interested in the final results than in the technical details is advised to directly skip to the sec .",
    "v.        in order to calculate the partition function , we separate the secondary structure into two categories as shown in fig .",
    "[ bubblestem ] .",
    "one is the bubble structure which contains only hairpins and multiloops .",
    "the other is the stem structure , which connects the bubbles , containing only stacking loops , bulges , and interior loops .",
    "we will study each of them individually and later combine them together .      in principle , the loop free energy depends on the length of a loop .",
    "thus , unbound bases also contribute to the total free energy .",
    "this contribution has been experimentally measured for small loops and behaves logarithmically with length when the loop is large .",
    "however , in the following we show that the free base energy of unbound bases provides only a negligible effect on the behavior of a stem and thus on the cross - over length if the stacking energy is relatively large .    to explore all possible ways of pair bindings , again a graphical recursion relation is helpful .",
    "such a recursion relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ stem ] . starting from a closed pair on the left",
    ", the following loop can be either a stacking loop , a bulge or an interior loop which correspond to the terms on the right hand side . to study the influence of a free energy for unbound bases",
    ", we assign the boltzmann factors , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , to each unbound base in a bulge and an interior loop respectively .",
    "if we define the partition function of stem structures with n bases and the first and the last bases of which is paired as @xmath44 , which corresponds to the left hand term , this relation in fig .  [ stem ]",
    "is formulated as @xmath45        to perform the z - transform , we have to consider the initial conditions , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "these initial conditions arise because certain structures are not allowed , e.g. , since a base can not be shared in two base pairings , a stem with 3 bases does not exist and this leads to @xmath47 .",
    "also when the length of a stem is small , certain loops which require many bases are not allowed , e.g. , the only available structure for a stem with 4 bases is a stacking loop . including these conditions , we apply the z - transform on eq .",
    "( 8) with the definition @xmath50 to resolve the convolution .",
    "solving for @xmath51 gives us @xmath52^{-1}.\\ ] ]    again the partition function @xmath53 can be obtained by applying the inverse z - transform on @xmath51 .    to illustrate the effect from the unbound bases , we show how their boltzmann factors affect the average behavior of the long stem structure .",
    "the average quantity of a certain type of loop or unbound base can be calculated as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the corresponding boltzmann factor . here , we specifically calculate the average number of unbound bases per interior loop , which is defined by @xmath56 in the large n limit , as a function of @xmath43 ( see appendix b for detailed calculations ) .     for different stacking energy .",
    "following the measured free energies  @xcite , we chose the typical values @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 for the other boltzmann factors.,width=264 ]    from fig .  [ avelenint ] , we can see that this average number is barely affected by @xmath43 when the boltzmann factor @xmath37 for a stacking loops is large .",
    "this can be easily understood as follows : for an interior loop , the unbound bases always introduce a strong energy penalty since less bases are available for stacking .",
    "this penalty is much larger than the penalty due to loss of the degree of freedom by one more free base .",
    "thus when the binding energy is large , the free base entropic penalty can be neglected . from fig .",
    "[ avelenint ] , we can see that interior loops tend to stay at the smallest length ( 2 unbound bases ) when @xmath37 is large , independent of the value of @xmath43 .",
    "since the same argument applies to bulges as well , we will set @xmath43 and @xmath42 to 1 for the rest of this publication .      in a similar fashion , a recursive relation for the bubble structure",
    "is found graphically as shown in fig .",
    "[ bubble ] . in the first relation for a closed bubble structure",
    ", we can have either a hairpin loop or a multiloop following from the closed pair at the end . in the second relation , the multiloop structure",
    "can be decomposed into two cases where the last base is either unbound or bound .",
    "since a multiloop has to have at least 3 branches , we have a term with two more bubble structures ; the last recursive term produces more branches .",
    "by defining the partition function for the closed bubble structure and multiloop structure with n bases as @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively , the recursive relations read @xmath62    here an additional boltzmann factor @xmath63 is introduced in the first relation at the position where two bubbles are connected .",
    "later we will insert stems into the bubble structure by replacing @xmath63 with the partition function of the stem structure .",
    "we also neglect the free base energy for unbound bases in hairpins and multiloops for similar arguments as above .    in this recursive relation ,",
    "the smallest multioop should have at least 4 bases such that two branchings can be connected .",
    "thus , we set the initial conditions as @xmath64 , which forbids a multiloop with length less than 4 . with the initial conditions , the recursive relations result in the following quadratic equation for the z - transformed @xmath65 : @xmath66",
    "to combine the stem and bubble structures , we insert a stem structure at each position represented by @xmath63 which is a placeholder for the connections between multiloops and hairpin loops in the bubble structure . in this case the first relation in fig .",
    "( [ bubble ] ) is modified as indicated in fig .",
    "[ insert ] .     by stem structures .",
    "the left hand term represents the closed structure with both stem and bubble structures in it.,width=302 ]    by defining the partition function of the closed structure on the left hand side as @xmath67 , the fig .",
    "[ insert ] reads @xmath68    after z - transform , this relation results in @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the following replacement @xmath70 combines stem and bubble structures together . in order to complete all possible structures",
    ", the single strands outside the closed end pair also have to be included .",
    "this can be done by going back to the first recursion relation , eq .",
    "( 3 ) , and replacing @xmath71 by the closed structures @xmath72 , which relates @xmath28 to @xmath73 as @xmath74    putting everything together , we obtain @xmath75 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that the leading singularity in @xmath76 is again from the branch cut induced by the square root .",
    "thus , as expected , the inverse z - transform leads to the same universal behavior  ( 7 ) with an exponent @xmath32 as the simple model we studied first .",
    "however , non - universal quantities such as the cross - over length @xmath0 will depend on the parameters of the extended model .      for natural rna molecules , a hairpin loop needs to have at least 3 unbound bases due to the width of the double helix ( which implies @xmath77 in the secondary structure )",
    "this minimum hairpin length constraint is easily taken into account in our calculations . under the constraint , a bubble structure which contains at least one hairpin must have at least 5 bases .",
    "thus , we adopt the initial condition , @xmath78 , when we perform the z - transform on eq .  ( 11 ) . the summation range in eq .",
    "( 11 ) is then changed and it simply leads to a substitution of @xmath39 by @xmath79 in all subsequent equations .",
    "this substitution is reasonable since @xmath80 represents the boltzmann factor for the free energy of one single base .",
    "the minimum hairpin length constraint reduces the number of available bases for binding by 3 , so it introduces an energy penalty @xmath81 which causes the boltzmann factor @xmath39 to be divided by @xmath82 . in this way , we can easily introduce any kind of minimum length constraint via a similar substitution . for example , if we require a bulge loop to have at least two unbound bases instead of one , the replacement of @xmath38 by @xmath83 will include this constraint .",
    "note , this principle also helps us to understand equation ( 10 ) for the stem structure .",
    "the terms with different powers of z , namely @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , arise because a stacking loop reduces the number of available bases for pairing by 2 , a bulge loop has at least one unbound base , and an interior loop has a minimum of 2 unbound bases , respectively .",
    "in this section , we will use the general results of sec .",
    "iv in order to calculate the cross - over length in our model for sequences with loop entropies .",
    "to derive the cross - over length , we need to solve for the branch point @xmath35 that is defined by the vanishing of the term under the square root in eq .  ( 17 ) . in principle",
    ", we can always obtain the numerical value of the branch point and expand @xmath28 around this point to obtain a numerical value for the cross - over length ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we will refer to this numerical value as the homogeneous cross - over length since it is obtained under the homogeneous molten phase model .",
    "however , since this calculation involves finding the root of a fourth order polynomial , no meaningful analytical expression can be found in general .",
    "thus , we resort to a large @xmath37 approximation in order to obtain an analytical expression . this approximation is justified since the boltzmann factor of a stacking loop , @xmath37 , is usually much larger than 1 while the loop boltzmann factors @xmath87 and @xmath40 are less than one . in this approximation , from eq .",
    "( 17 ) we find the branch point @xmath88 , i.e. , the free energy per base is @xmath89 .",
    "this can be easily interpreted since we expect most bases to form pairs due to the favorable stacking loops such that the free energy per base is half of the free energy of a stacking loop .      including the minimum hairpin length constraint introduced in sec .",
    "iv.d , we expand the branch point @xmath35 near @xmath90 .",
    "then , the approximated analytical formula for the cross - over length becomes @xmath91 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it has a straight forward interpretation : the simplest possible structure is a long stem with one hairpin at the end .",
    "every additional branching of the structure requires formation of one hairpin and one multiloop . since upon formation of the hairpin and mulitloop ,",
    "at least 3 bases become unbound , the boltzmann factor for a branching is @xmath92 .",
    "the prefactor in eq .",
    "( 18 ) is up to the numerical factor of @xmath93 the inverse square root of this expression .",
    "thus , we conclude that the cross - over length which becomes larger as the boltzmann factor for a single branching becomes smaller can be interpreted as the minimum length that allows a certain degree of branchings .",
    "since the boltzmann factors @xmath38 and @xmath2 appear only in the higher order terms , they barely modify the cross - over length and can be neglected altogether .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that @xmath38 and @xmath2 only play roles in the stem structure , but not in the bubble structure .",
    "the leading term of the approximated analytical formula  ( 18 ) will be referred to as the large s cross - over length .      for the analytical large s cross - over length to be useful",
    ", we have to know how good they agree with the numerical value of the homogeneous cross - over length . here",
    ", we compare these two values for many different choices of energy parameters covering the whole range of realistic values . fig .",
    "9 shows how the large s cross - over length approaches the homogeneous one as @xmath37 gets large .",
    "typical values for the boltzmann factor of a stacking loop @xmath37 involving gc pairs are @xmath94  @xcite , so the approximation is very good in this region . for stacking loops involving au pairs ,",
    "@xmath37 is around 5 so a deviation from the approximated formula in the large @xmath37 limit can be seen .",
    "however , since @xmath0 only sets the order of magnitude of the length beyond which the asymptotic theory is applicable , the large s cross - over length with a deviation by a factor of 2 at @xmath95 is still a good estimation .     and @xmath96 .",
    "these choices cover the region of realistic values.,width=264 ]",
    "while for a generic rna sequence , the molten phase model is believed to only apply at sufficiently high temperature , it can be applied to repeated sequences at all temperatures below denaturation since each repeated unit can be viewed as the equivalent of a base in the molten phase ( fig .",

    "iv and v , and to get a feeling for typical cross - over lengths , we now compare our large s cross - over length of repeated sequences with the full numerical results .",

    "a verification of this value is beyond the reach of the numerical procedure using the vienna package . since the cross - over length",
    "is expected to decrease as the denaturation transition is reached , the full numerical verification could be performed at a higher temperature .",

    "this is beyond the limit of most natural rnas and suggests that the structure ensemble of @xmath108 and @xmath115 molecules can never be described by the asymptotic theory for any naturally available molecules .",
    "lastly , we want to explore the sequence dependence of the cross - over length for short repeated sequences .",
    "we study all possible partially self - complementary repeated sequences of unit length two and three and evaluate their cross - over lengths using the formula for the large s cross - over length .",

    "the dash lines stand for base pairing of ground state .",
    "the dot lines show the possibilities for base g to pair with neighboring c.,width=302 ]    for non self - complementary repeated sequences , e.g. , the @xmath116 sequence , it is not a priori clear that we can map the repeated unit gcc onto one single base in the molten phase ( fig .",
    "[ gcc ] ) since base g can pair with either one of the two bases c. however , we verified numerically that more than 99% of the g s are paired in the stacked configuration indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "this is due to the large loss in free energy as one stacking loop is lost and a bulge loop is created .",
    "we verified this behavior for all the partially self - complementary sequences in our discussion .",
    "thus , we can safely use the same approach as used for the @xmath104 sequence and calculate the large s cross - over length .",
    "the results are shown in the following table .",
    ".large s cross - over length of short repeated sequences . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can see that the cross - over lengths spread over the whole range from only several bases to @xmath117 bases . this non universal behavior has to be treated individually for different sequences . for longer repeated units",
    ", we expect similar behavior but we did not verify this due to the complicated entropic effects .",
    "for our asymptotic description to be appropriate , an rna sequence must be long enough to allow a certain degree of branching .",
    "the cross - over length at which this happens for homogeneous sequences is strongly sequence dependent . specifically for cases",
    "when stacking is very favorable and hairpins and multiloops are unfavorable , the cross - over length @xmath0 can be very large . in this region ,",
    "finite size effects are very important and have to be taken into account in any numerical simulation or interpretation of experimental data in terms of asymptotic formulas .",
    "our analytical results provide an easy way to estimate this cross - over length for realistic energy models .",
    "it remains as an interesting and relevant question how large the cross - over lengths for generic , non - homogeneous sequences in the glassy phase are .",
    "unfortunately , this question can at this stage neither be addressed numerically nor analytically since even the expected asymptotic behavior is elusive .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of large cross - over length in the molten phase as established here suggests that also in the glass phase large cross - over length have to be considered as a serious possibility .",
    "as an example , here we solve for the partition function for the molten phase model . from eq .",

    "the analytical part @xmath121 can be dropped since it does not contribute to the integral .",
    "the square root introduces a branch cut with two branch points at the ends . by taking the contour c as the smallest loop around the branch cut ,",
    "the integral becomes @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the branch point with greatest real part and @xmath124 is the other branch point . in the large n limit , due to the exponent factor @xmath125",
    ", we expect that only the behavior near @xmath35 is important , so we can expand the integrand around @xmath35 and perform the approximation .    to do this integral , we first consider a more general case where @xmath126 .",

    "the calculation of partition function for the stem structure @xmath53 is different from that for the molten phase model because there is no branch cut , so we do not expect the universal behavior @xmath137 . however , the fact that only the pole with the greatest real part is important in the large n limit is preserved . from eq .",
    "( 8) , the z - transform of the partition function for the stem structure @xmath51 has the form @xmath138 where @xmath139 in the large n limit , the inverse z - transform can be approximated by @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the pole with greatest real part .",
    "since @xmath142 is the dominating term for large n , the average quantity can be approximated as @xmath143 so the average number of unbound bases per interior loop can be obtained by @xmath144 . here",
