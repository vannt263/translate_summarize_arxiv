    "the automated 3d reconstruction of _ general _ scenes from multiple views obtained using conventional cameras , under uncontrolled acquisition , is a paramount goal of computer vision , ambitious even by modern standards .",
    "while a fully complete working system addressing all the underlying challenges is beyond current technology , significant progress has been made in the past few years using approaches that fall into three broad classes , depending on whether one focuses on correlating isolated points , surface patches , or curvilinear structures across views , as described below .       +           a vast majority of multiview reconstruction methods rely on correlating isolated interest points across views to produce an unorganized 3d cloud of points .",
    "the * interest - point - based approach * has been highly successful in reconstructing large - scale scenes with _ texture - rich images _ , in systems such as in phototourism and recent large - scale 3d reconstuction work  @xcite . despite their manifest usefulness ,",
    "these methods generally can not represent smooth , textureless regions ( due to the sparsity of interest points in image regions with homogeneous appearance ) , or regions that change appearance drastically across views .",
    "this limits their applicability , especially in man - made environments  @xcite and objects such as cars  @xcite , non - lambertian surfaces such as that of the sea , appearance variation due to changing weather  @xcite , and wide baseline  @xcite .",
    "another approach matches intensity patterns across views using multiview stereo , producing denser point clouds or mesh reconstructions . *",
    "dense multi - view stereo * produces detailed 3d reconstructions of objects imaged under controlled conditions by a large number of precisely calibrated cameras  @xcite . for general , complex scenes with various kinds of objects and surface properties ,",
    "this approach has shown most promise towards obtaining an accurate and dense 3d model of a given scene .",
    "homogeneous areas , such as walls of a corridor , repeated texture , and areas with view - dependent intensities create challenges for these methods .    a smaller number of techniques correlate and reconstruct image * curvilinear structure * across views , resulting in 3d curvilinear structure .",
    "pipelines based on straight lines ( see  @xcite for recent reviews ) , algebraic and general curve features  @xcite have been proposed , but some lack generality , _",
    "e.g. _ , requiring specific curve models  @xcite .",
    "the 3d curve sketch system  @xcite operates on multiple views by pairing curves from two arbitrary `` hypothesis views '' at a time via epipolar - geometric consistency .",
    "a curve pair reconstructs to a 3d curve fragment hypothesis , whose reprojection onto several other `` confirmation views '' gathers support from subpixel 2d edges . the curve pair hypotheses with enough support result in an unorganized set of 3d curve fragments , the `` 3d curve sketch '' . while the resulting 3d curve segments are visually appealing , they are fragmented , redundant , and lack explicit inter - curve organization .",
    "the plethora of multiview representations , as documented above , arise because 3d structures are geometrically and semantically rich  @xcite .",
    "a building , for example , has walls , windows , doorways , roof , chimneys , etc .",
    "the structure can be represented by sample points ( _ i.e. _ , unorganized cloud of points ) or a surface mesh where connectivity among points is captured .",
    "this representation , especially when rendered with surface albedo or texture , is visually appealing .",
    "however , the representation also leaves out a great deal of semantic information : which points or mesh areas represent a window or a wall ?",
    "which two walls are adjacent ?",
    "the representation of such components , or parts , requires an explicit representation of part boundaries such as ridges , as well as where these boundaries come together , such as junctions .",
    "the same point can equally arise if objects in the scene were solely defined by their curve structures . a representation of a building by its ridges may usually give an appealing impression of its structure , but it fails to identify the walls , _",
    "i.e. _ , which collection of 3d curves bound a wall and what its geometry is .",
    "both surfaces and curves are important and needed across the board , _",
    "e.g. _ , in applications such as robotics  @xcite , urban planning and industrial design  @xcite , fig .  [",
    "fig : architectural : drawing ] . in general ,",
    "image curve fragments are attractive because they have good localization , they have greater invariance than interest points to changes in illumination , are stable over a greater range of baselines , and are typically denser than interest points .",
    "furthermore , the reflectance or ridge curves provide boundary condition for surface reconstruction , while occluding contour variations across views lead to surfaces  @xcite .",
    "recent studies strongly support the notion that image curves contain much of the image information  @xcite .",
    "moreover , curves are structurally rich as reflected by their differential geometry , a fact which is exploited both in recent computer systems  @xcite and peception studies  @xcite .",
    "this paper develops the technology to process a series of ( intrinsic and extrinsically ) calibrated multiview images to generate a _",
    "3d curve drawing _ as a graph of 3d curve segments meeting at junctions .",
    "the ultimate goal of this approach is to integrate the 3d curve drawing with the traditional recovery of surfaces so that 3d curves bound the 3d curve segments , towards a more semantic representation of 3d structures .",
    "the 3d curve drawing can also be of independent value in applications such as fast recognition of general 3d scenery  @xcite , efficient transmission of general 3d scenes , scene understanding and modeling by reasoning at junctions  @xcite , consistent non - photorealistic rendering from video  @xcite , modeling of branching structures , among others  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : improved : sketch ] we review the 3d curve sketch , identify three shortcomings and suggest solutions to each , resulting in the _ enhanced curve sketch_. since the original 3d curve sketch was built around a few views at a time , it did not address fundamental issues surrounding integration of information from numerous views .",
    "section  [ sec:3d : drawing ] presents as our main contribution the multiview integration of information both at edge- and curve - level , which naturally leads to junctions .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] validates the approach using real and synthetic datasets .",
    "image curve fragments formed from grouped edges are central to our framework .",
    "each image @xmath0 at view @xmath1 contains a number of curves @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "reconstructed 3d curve fragments are referred as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , whose reprojection onto view @xmath6 is @xmath7 .",
    "indices may be omitted where clear from context .",
    "the initial stage of our framework is built as an extension of the hypothesize - and - verify 3d curve sketch approach  @xcite .",
    "we use the same hypothesis generation mechanism with a novel verification step performing a finer - level analysis of image evidence and significantly reducing the fragmentation and redundancy in the 3d models .",
    "two image curves @xmath8 and @xmath9 are paired from two distinct views @xmath10 and @xmath11 at a time , the _ hypothesis views _ , provided they have sufficient epipolar overlap  @xcite .",
    "the verification of these @xmath12 curve pair hypotheses , represented as @xmath13 , @xmath5 with the corresponding 3d reconstruction denoted as @xmath4 , gauges the extent of edge support for the reprojection @xmath7 of @xmath4 onto another set of _ confirmation views _ , @xmath14 .",
    "an image edge in view @xmath6 suports @xmath7 if it is sufficiently close in distance _ and _ orientation .",
    "the total support a hypothesis @xmath15 receives from view @xmath6 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the length of @xmath7 , and @xmath18 is the extent of edge support at @xmath19 .",
    "a view is considered a _ supporting view _ for @xmath13 if @xmath20 .",
    "evidence from confirmation views is aggregated in the form @xmath21 s^v_{\\omega_k}.\\ ] ] the set of hypotheses @xmath13 whose support @xmath22 exceeds a threshold are kept and the resulting @xmath4 form the unorganized 3d curves .    despite these advances , three major shortcomings remain : @xmath23 some 3d curve fragments are correct for certain portions of the underlying curve and erroneous in other parts , due to multiview grouping inconsistencies ; @xmath24 gaps in the 3d model , typically due to unreliable reconstructions near epipolar tangencies , where epipolar lines are nearly tangent to the curves ; and @xmath25 multiple , redundant 3d structures .",
    "we now document each issue and describe our solutions .",
    "* erroneous grouping : * inconsistent multiview grouping of edges can lead to reconstructed curves which are veridical only along some portion , which are nevertheless wholly admitted , fig .",
    "[ fig : sample : localization](a ) . also , fully - incorrect hypotheses can accrue support coincidentally , as with repeated patterns or linear structures , fig .",
    "[ fig : sample : localization](b ) .",
    "both issues can be addressed by allowing for selective local reconstructions : only those portions of the curve receiving adequate edge support from sufficient views are reconstructed .",
    "this ensures that inconsistent 2d groupings do not produce spurious 3d reconstructions . the shift from cumulative global to multi - view local support results in greater selectivity and deals with coincidental alignment of edges with the reconstruction hypotheses .",
    "* gaps : * the geometric inaccuracy of curve segment reconstructions nearly parallel to epipolar lines led  @xcite to break off curves at epipolar tangencies , creating 2d gaps leading to gaps in 3d .",
    "we observe , however , that while reconstructions near epipolar tangency are _ geometrically unreliable _ , they are _ topologically correct _ in that they connect the reliable portions correctly but with highly inaccurate geometry .",
    "what is needed is to flag curve segments near epipolar tangency reconstructions as geometrically unreliable .",
    "we do this by the integration of support in equation  [ eq : support ] , giving significantly lower weight to these unreliable portions instead of fully discarding them , which greatly reduces the presence of gaps in the resulting reconstruction .",
    "* redundancy : * a 2d curve can pair up with dozens of curves from other views , all pointing to the same reconstruction , leading to redundant pairwise reconstructions as partially overlapping 3d curve segments , each localized slightly differently . our solution is to detect and reconcile redundant reconstructions . since redundancy changes as one traverses a 3d curve , we reconcile redundancy at the local level : each 3d edge is in one - to - one correspondence with a 2d edge of its primary hypothesis view ( _ i.e. _ , the first view from which it was reconstructed ) , hence 3d edges can be grouped in a one - to - one manner , all corresponding to a common 3d source .",
    "these are robustly averaged by data - driven outlier removal , where a gaussian distribution is fit on all pairwise distances between corresponding samples , discarding samples farther than @xmath26 from the average , fig .  [",
    "fig : robust : averaging ] .",
    "averaging improves localization accuracy , removes redundancy , and elongates shorter curve subsegments into longer 3d curves .    .",
    "notice the significant reduction in both outliers and duplicate reconstructions , without sacrificing coverage .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]",
    "despite the visible improvements of the enhanced 3d curve sketch of section  [ sec : improved : sketch ] , fig .  [",
    "fig : improved : qual ] , curves are broken in many places , and there remains redundant overlap . the sketch representation as unorganized clouds of 3d curves",
    "are not able to capture the fine - level geometry or spatial organization of 3d curves , _ e.g._by using junction points to characterize proximity and neighborhood relations . the underlying cause of these issues is lack of integration across multiple views . the robust averaging approach of section  [ sec : improved : sketch ] is one step , anchored on one primary hypothesis view , but integrates evidence within that view only ; a scene curve can be visible from multiple hypothesis view pairs , and some redundancy remains .",
    "this lack of multiview integration is responsible for three problems observed in the enhanced curve sketch , fig .",
    "[ fig : issues : remaining ] : @xmath23 localization inaccuracies , fig .",
    "[ fig : issues : remaining]b , due to use of partial information ; @xmath24 reconstruction redundancy , which lends to multiple curves with partial overlap , all arising from the same 3d structure , but remaining distinct , see fig .",
    "[ fig : issues : remaining]c ; @xmath25 excessive breaking because each curve segment arises from one curve in one initial view independently .",
    "* multiview local consistency network : * the key idea underlying integration of reconstructions across views is the detection of a common image structure supporting two reconstruction hypotheses .",
    "two 3d local curve segments depict the same single underlying 3d object feature if they are supported by the same 2d image edge structures .",
    "since the identification of common image structure can vary along the curve , it must necessarily be a local process , operating at the level of a 3d local edge and not a 3d curve .",
    "two 3d edge elements ( edgels ) depict the same 3d structure if they receive support from the same 2d edgels in a sufficient number of views , so 3d-2d links between a 2d edgel to the 3d edgel it supports must be kept . typically , they share supporting image edges in many views ; and the number of shared supporting edgels is the measure of strength for a 3d-3d link between them .",
    "formally , we define the multiview local geometric consistency network ( mln ) as pointwise alignments @xmath27 between two 3d curves @xmath28 and @xmath29 : let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be two points in two 3d curves , and define @xmath32 then the a kernel function @xmath33 defines a consistency link between these two points , weighted by the extent of multiview image support @xmath34     * the barcelona pavilion dataset : * a realistic synthetic dataset we created for validating the present approach with control over illumination , geometry and cameras .",

    "this is the first synthetic 3d ground truth for evaluating multiview reconstruction algorithms that is realistically complex ",
    "most existing ground truth is obtained using either laser or structured light methods , both of which suffer from reconstruction inaccuracies and calibration errors .",

    "the epfl benchmark  @xcite makes the ground truth 3d models publicly available , but these datasets are limited in the number of views in the image sequence , as well object types and illumination conditions captured in the scene . in our case , the difficulty is compounded by the fact that our reconstruction is a wireframe representation , whereas almost all existing ground truth for multiview stereo is for evaluating dense surface reconstruction algorithms .",
    "+    +     our first approach for reliable and fair evaluation of our 3d drawing algorithm is to utilize a synthetic 3d model and a rendering software to factor out calibration and reconstruction errors common among ground truth models obtained from real world objects . here ,",

    "three different illumination conditions were rendered , and these can be mixed up to test any given algorithm s robustness under varying illumination , such as a slow sunset .",
    "this synthetic data was modeled after a real scene in barcelona .         to the best of our knowledge , there is no popular , publicly - available multiview stereo ground truth that is based on a precise and complex 3d model and its rendered images .",
    "we have made two versions of our barcelona pavilion dataset available for the evaluation of 3d reconstruction algorithms : i ) the full mesh version for evaluating dense surface reconstruction algorithms , ii ) 3d curve version for evaluating curvilinear models , such as the 3d drawing presented in this work , figure  [ fig : synth : gt : pavilion : curves : fake ] .",
    "the latter version was obtained by a blender - aided process of manually deleting surface meshes until only the outline of the objects remained , see figure  [ fig : synth : gt : pavilion : chair : overlay ] and figure  [ fig : synth : gt : pavilion : lotus ] .",
    "although the barcelona pavilion dataset allows for a very precise and reliable way of evaluating 3d models , a point can be made about the necessity of testing any reconstruction algorithm in the context of real world objects and real camera imagery to get a real sense of its performance .",
    "our second approach , therefore , is to appropriate one of the many scenes present in dtu robot dataset  @xcite to the task of evaluating 3d curvilinear reconstructions .",
    "this is a significantly harder task than eliminating the surface meshes in the synthetic case , since the ground truth representation is a 3d point cloud , and no explicit distinction is made between curve outlines and surface geometry .",
    "we therefore use blender to project the 3d point cloud ground truth for our selected scene onto several different images , correct for calibration errors to the best of our capacity , then remove all the internal surface points to end up with a subset of 3d points which are in the proximity of curved structures in the scene , * see the full supplementary materials*.",
