    "an application of quantum phenomena to securing optical network has received much attention . in this case , instead of mathematical encryption , a guarantee of security by a physical principle is expected .",
    "so far the quantum key distribution(qkd ) based on very weak optical signals has been developed and demonstrated in many institutions .",
    "however , these have inherent difficulty such as quantum implementations and very low bit rates compared to current data transmission rates .    in order to cope with such a drawback , in 2000 ,",
    "a new quantum cipher was proposed [ 1 ] .",
    "it is a kind of stream cipher with randomization by quantum noise generated in measurement of coherent state from the conventional laser diode .",
    "the scheme is called yuen-2000 protocol(y-00 ) or @xmath0 scheme[2,3 ] which consists of large number of basis to transmit the information bit and pseudo random number generator(prng ) for the selection of the basis . a coherent state as the ciphertext which is transmitted from the optical transmitter(alice ) is determined by the input data and the running key @xmath1 from the output sequence of prng with a secret key @xmath2 .",
    "the legitimate receiver(bob ) has the same prng , so he can receive the correct ciphertext under the small error , and simultaneously demodulate the information bit .",
    "the attacker ( eve ) , who does not know the key , has to try to discriminate all possible coherent state signals . since the signal distance among coherent state signals are designed as very small , eve s receiver suffers serious error to get the ciphertext .",
    "such a difference of the accuracy of the ciphertext for bob and eve brings preferable security which can not be obtained in any conventional cipher .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to clarify the quantitative security evaluation for this type of cipher , because all physical parameter for the cipher system is finite .",
    "so far , complexity theory approach [ 4 ] and information theoretic approach [ 5 ] have been tried , but still there is no rigorous theoretical treatment .",
    "recently , yuen has pointed out that it is possible to show the rigorous security analysis when the parameters are allowed to be asymptotical , and showed a sketch of the properties using a model of coherent pulse position modulation ( cppm ) [ 6 ] .",
    "this may open a new way for the quantum key distribution with coherent states of considerable energy and high speed .    in this paper , we clarify a generation method of cppm quantum signal by using a theory of unitary operator and symplectic transformation , and show a security property and its numerical examples . in the section",
    "ii , the back ground for the information theoretic security and the shannon limit are explained . in the section iii and iv",
    ", we describe a theory of cppm . in the section",
    "v and vi , we discuss on the security and implementation problem .",
    "in the conventional cipher , the ciphertext @xmath3 is determined by the information bit @xmath4 and running key @xmath1 . this",
    "is called non random cipher .",
    "however , one can introduce more general cipher system so called random cipher by noise such that the ciphertext is defined as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is noise .",
    "such a random cipher by noise may provide a new property in the security . in shannon theory for the symmetric key cipher",
    ", we have the following theorem .",
    "+   + * theorem 1*(shannon , 1949 [ 7 ] ) + the information theoretic security against ciphertext only attack on data has the limit @xmath7    this is called shannon limit for the symmetric key cipher . to be beyond",
    "the shannon limit is essential for fresh key generation by communication or information theoretic security against known plaintext attack in the symmetric key cipher . in the context of random cipher",
    ", one can exceed this limit .",
    "it is known that the necessary condition for exceeding the limit is @xmath8 [ 6,8,9 ] .",
    "that is , the ciphertexts for bob and eve are different .",
    "still the necessary and sufficient condition is not clear , but if the following relation holds , one can say that the cipher exceeds the shannon limit @xmath9 this means that eve can not pin down the information bit even if she gets a secret key after her measurement of the ciphertext while bob can do it . in the following sections",
    ", we will clarify that cppm has indeed such a property .",
    "the coherent pulse position modulation ( cppm ) cryptosystem has been proposed as a quantum cipher permitting asymptotical system parameters [ 1,6 ] .",
    "alice encodes her classical messages by the block encoding where @xmath10-bit block @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) corresponds to the pulse position modulation ( ppm ) quantum signals with @xmath13 slots , @xmath14 in addition , alice apply the unitary operator @xmath15 to ppm quantum signals @xmath16 , where the unitary operator @xmath15 is randomly chosen via running key @xmath17 generated by using prng on a secret key @xmath2 .",
    "thus , alice gets cppm quantum signal states , @xmath18 which are sent to bob .",
    "let us assume an ideal channel .",
    "since the secret key @xmath2 , prng and the map @xmath19 are shared by alice and bob , bob can apply the unitary operator @xmath20 to the received cppm quantum signal @xmath21 and obtain the ppm quantum signal @xmath22 .",
    "bob decodes the message by the direct detection for @xmath16 , which is known to be a suboptimal detection for ppm signals [ 10 ] .",
    "then bob s block error rate is given by @xmath23 here @xmath24 holds for enough large signal energy @xmath25 .",
    "in contrast , eve does not know the secret key @xmath2 and hence she must detect cppm quantum signals directly .",
    "this makes eve s error probaility worse than bob s one .",
    "in this section , we discuss a method for the construction of cppm quantum signals from ppm ones by the unitary operator associated with a symplectic transformation .      the classical probability distribution @xmath26 is characterized by the _",
    "characteristic function _",
    "@xmath27\\pi(dx)$ ] .",

    "we extend this argument to define the quantum gaussian state @xcite .",
    "we consider self adjoint operators on a hilbert space @xmath31 , @xmath32 satisfying heisenberg ccr : @xmath33=i\\delta _ { jk}\\hbar i,\\;\\;[q_{j},q_{k}]=0,\\;\\;[p_{j},p_{k}]=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",

    "any unitary operator composed of beam splitters and phase shifts can be described by a symplectic transformation .",
    "first , let us consider the state @xmath67 for a general @xmath13-ary coherent state @xmath68 . by using eq .",

    "our interest is devoted to the case where the state @xmath67 is an @xmath13-ary coherent state .",

    "we give a foundation for discussing security of cppm cryptosystem . without knowing",
    "the secret key @xmath2 eve can not apply the appropriate unitary operator to cppm quantum signals , and hence she has to receive directly cppm quantum signals . since the quantum optimum receiver is unknown for such signals ,",
    "we apply the heterodyne receiver , which is suboptimum and appropriate to discuss the performance of error .",
    "this scheme is called heterodyne attack .",
    "our main target in this subsection is to study the heterodyne attack on @xmath67 , where @xmath51 is the the unitary operator associated with @xmath85 , and @xmath96 is a general @xmath13-ary coherent state @xmath63 .",
    "heterodyne detection is characterized by a family of operators with a parameter @xmath97 , @xmath98 the outcomes @xmath99 of the heterodyne detection for a coherent state @xmath100 appears with the probability density function @xmath101 which represents the normal distribution with the correlation matrix @xmath102 .",
    "the outcomes @xmath103 of the indivisual heterodyne detection for @xmath67 obeys the probability density function , @xmath104 with @xmath105 . here , putting @xmath106 and taking account of eq ( [ rel alpha ] ) , we get @xmath107 note that @xmath108 represents the conjugate transpose and @xmath109 corresponds to the unitary operator @xmath110 . substituting this equation to eq .",

    "( [ pu ] ) shows that the vectors @xmath113 given by applying the unitary matrix @xmath109 to the outcomes @xmath114 obeys the probability density function @xmath112 .",
    "it is difficult to evaluate the error performance for cppm quantum signals by heterodyne attack , because the randomness of prng has to be taken into account .",
    "yuen showed the lower bound of the error performance by using heterodyne detection for the original ppm quantum signals [ 6 ] .",
    "but it may be not tight one .",
    "here we try another approach .",
    "we allow eve to get the secret key @xmath2 after her measurement by heterodyne for cppm quantum signals and hence to know the unitary operator @xmath15 and the corresponding unitary matrix @xmath115 .",
    "then , from the discussions in the subsection [ 7_1 ] , eve can apply the unitary matrix @xmath116 to obtain the vector @xmath117 , which obeys to the probability density function @xmath118 .",
    "this fact enables us to apply the decoding process for ppm signals .",

    "putting @xmath125 and @xmath126 in ( [ kagen ] ) , we obtain @xmath127 let us consider the case of @xmath128 . then bob s error probability @xmath129 is less than @xmath130 , while @xmath123 converges to @xmath131 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows convergence behavior of lower bound for @xmath123 . in this figure ,",
    "the lower bounds ( [ kagen ] ) for @xmath132 , are plotted with respect to @xmath133 . since the parameter @xmath134 in the lower bound ( [ kagen ] ) can take arbitrary real number , values of error probability @xmath123 exist the region above the graphs in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "note that the above values of @xmath134 are chosen as they give better lower bounds for @xmath123 . from figure @xmath135",
    ", it is found that the convergence speed of lower bound for @xmath123 is very slow ; @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) is needed to achieve the error probability 0.9 .",
    "thus , in the cppm scheme , eve can not pin down the information bit even if she gets the true secret key @xmath2 and prng after her measurement , and consequently it has been proved that cppm satisfies eq(3 ) .",
    "after her measurement for cppm quantum signals ]",
    "according to the above analysis , one needs large number of @xmath10 when the signal energy is large . here",
    "we give a requirement of channel bandwidth for the secure communication by cppm .",
    "let us assume that the signal band width is @xmath138 when there is no coding . in our scheme , first one has to transform the @xmath10 input information bit sequence to ppm signal with @xmath139 slots .",
    "second , such ppm signals are converted into cppm with the same number of slots .",
    "if one wants to transmit such cppm signal with no delay , the required bandwidth is @xmath140 thus , the bandwidth exponentially increases with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "since one needs the large @xmath10 to ensure the security , one needs a huge bandwidth .    on the other hand",
    ", we need to realize the unitary transformation to generate cppm quantum signals from ppm ones .",
    "such transformations may be implemented by combination of beam splitters and phase shifts [ 6 ] , but to generate the cppm quantum signals with uniform distance for all signal , we need also large number of elements .",
    "thus we need more detailed consideration for the practical use . in future work",
    ", we will specify the realization method .",
    "a crucial element of the coherent pulse position modulation cryptosystem is a generation of cppm quantum signals from ppm ones by a unitary operator . in this paper , we have given a proper theory for a unitary operator and a symplectic transformation basing on the quantum characteristic function .",
    "furthermore , by using the above results , we have shown the lower bound of error probability in the case where eve gets the secret key after her measurement .",
