    "the realization of large spin accumulation , that can be described by introducing the quasi - chemical potentials @xmath0 for spin - up and spin - down electrons in the system possessing long spin relaxation time , is important for many proposals in spintronics .",
    "in particular , the non - equilibrium spin polarization might be created by illuminating the sample with circularly polarized light @xcite , or can be achieved in conductors placed in contact to the ferromagnet via the spin injection mechanism @xcite , see for a review @xcite .",
    "the spin injection and detection were investigated in many works and for different types of materials such as superconductors @xcite , organic polymers @xcite , graphene @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a progress in achieving of large spin accumulation by means of electrical spin injection in semiconductors such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xcite .    motivated by experiments on spin accumulation , we focus on the non - equilibrium correlation effects in conductivity and density of states ( dos ) in the presence of spin accumulation .",
    "quantum corrections to the transport and thermodynamical properties of disordered metallic conductors have been a subject of both theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "electron - electron interaction in disordered conductors results in the singularities of electron dos at the fermi level and positive magnetoresistivity , for a review see @xcite .",
    "for example , the energy dependence of the interaction correction to the electron dos at zero temperature has a logarithmic singularity in two dimensions @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the electron mean free time .",
    "in addition , external magnetic field @xmath6 due to zeeman splitting leads to singularities shifted from the fermi energy by the amount @xmath7 as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the bohr magneton .",
    "we define @xmath11 in such a way that it can be of either sign , depending on the direction of magnetic field .",
    "the interaction correction to the conductivity decreases in magnetic field in the limit of weak spin relaxation as @xcite @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the electron - electron interaction constant and @xmath14 is dos at the fermi level per one spin .",
    "more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "correlation effects related to the spin degree of freedom can also play a significant role in magnetoresistance in the hopping conductivity regime . if the coulomb repulsion between electrons permits the onsite double occupancy , then the probability of certain transitions under the zeeman splitting decreases leading to positive magnetoresistivity @xcite .    in the following sections we consider correlation effects in dos and conductivity in case of finite spin accumulation @xmath15 .",
    "we essentially rely on the calculations done for the equilibrium case , therefore we discuss only the features that distinguish the non - equilibrium case .",
    "we consider disordered metallic conductor in the presence of spin accumulation and magnetic field .",
    "the spin accumulation can be obtained either by spin injection or optical orientation methods .",
    "we assume that the spin relaxation time in the system is much longer than the energy relaxation time such that we can treat the system in the energy equilibrium regime while having the non - equilibrium spin polarization . within this assumption",
    "the interaction correction to the one particle dos in the non - equilibrium state generated by spin accumulation can be treated in the similar way done for the equilibrium case @xcite .",
    "we need to take into account the non - equilibrium exchange splitting in the definition of retarded and advanced green functions and to modify the fermi distribution function of electrons by introducing the chemical potential shifts of electrons with spin - up and spin - down .",
    "interaction correction to the one particle dos is determined by the advanced component of green function @xmath16 where @xmath17 defines the spin direction and we accept the units @xmath18 .",
    "let us consider the exchange part of the interaction correction shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:1 ] ) , where diffusion contribution to the self - energy part is given as @xmath19   d_{0}^{2 } \\left(\\omega-\\epsilon,\\mathbf{q}\\right ) v_{a}\\left(\\omega-\\epsilon , \\mathbf{q}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath20 is the diffusion propagator , @xmath21 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath22 is the volume of the system and screened coulomb potential is given by the following expression @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the coulomb potential and @xmath25 .",
    "function @xmath26 is determined by the keldysh component of the non - equilibrium green function , which after averaging over random potential becomes @xmath27        where @xmath28 are the retarded / advanced green functions of electrons with spin direction @xmath29 .",
    "function @xmath26 in the uniform state described by the chemical potential shifts @xmath15 can be written as @xmath30 we see that the integral over @xmath31 of the first term in expression ( [ sigma ] ) proportional to @xmath32 is equal to zero since all diffusion poles are in the region @xmath33 . substituting ( [ udistr ] ) into ( [ sigma ] ) we note that expression ( [ sigma ] ) is equal to the equilibrium one under the substitution of energy @xmath34 by energy @xmath35 in the expression for correction to dos for spin direction @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the total correction to dos for spin direction @xmath36 has the form    @xmath37 ^ 2}+ \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(u_{r,0}(\\omega,\\mathbf{q})-v_{r}(\\omega,\\mathbf{q}))\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon-\\omega-\\alpha\\delta\\mu/2}{2t}\\right)}{[d\\mathbf{q}^2- i\\omega]^2}\\right]\\ ] ]    where we define @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , while the polarization operator is @xmath40 here we include zeeman splitting @xmath11 and exchange energy that is self - consistently defined as @xmath41=\\frac{\\lambda\\nu}{1-\\lambda\\nu}[\\omega_z+\\delta\\mu]\\ ] ] we assume uniform spin accumulation and magnetic field applied parallel to the non - equilibrium magnetization .",
    "magnetic field polarizes electron spin in the system and as a result the spin polarization @xmath42 in the paramagnet is a sum of two contributions coming from spin accumulation and applied magnetic field . @xmath43\\ ] ] note , that we always assume @xmath15 to be positive .",
    "at the same time @xmath11 can be either positive or negative depending on direction of the magnetic field .",
    "let us now consider spin accumulation in the paramagnet in the two - dimensional limit .",
    "we take into account that @xmath44 , coulomb interaction is @xmath45 and we also assume small parameter @xmath46 .",
    "we find that the energy dependence of the interaction correction to the density of states in two dimensional conductor at @xmath47 has the form    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the inverse static screening length .    comparing this expression with that in the equilibrium case @xcite",
    ", we find that when spin polarization @xmath42 is zero , non - equilibrium spin accumulation splits the singularities of the density of states at @xmath50 @xcite to @xmath51 for electron with spin up and down , correspondingly .",
    "if @xmath52 then the density of states exhibits singularities located at @xmath53 for small @xmath54 in addition to the singularities at @xmath55 .",
    "this case is similar to the equilibrium one in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "when considering the interaction correction to conductivity in the presence of chemical potential shifts we can use the results obtained for equilibrium @xcite similarly as it was done for dos .",
    "the combined effect of external magnetic field and spin accumulation on conductivity is determined by total spin polarization .",
    "expression for conductivity contains function @xmath56 $ ] that appears as a result of integration of the equilibrium fermi distribution functions . instead of these equilibrium functions",
    "we obtain for @xmath15-dependent part of conductivity @xmath57=\\\\=\\frac{d}{d\\omega}(\\omega-\\alpha\\delta\\mu)\\coth\\left(\\frac{\\omega-\\alpha\\delta\\mu}{2t}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a result , we obtain the expression for the spin accumulation dependent interaction correction to the conductivity    @xmath58}{\\left ( d\\mathbf{q}^{2}-i\\omega - i\\alpha(\\omega_z + \\omega_p ) \\right ) ^{3}}\\ ] ]    expression ( [ s1 ] ) coincides with that in the equilibrium case @xcite with the corresponding spin polarization @xmath42 , similarly as it was done for dos . the interaction correction to the conductivity of two - dimensional metallic system in the limit of large spin accumulation @xmath59",
    "becomes @xmath60 while in the small spin accumulation @xmath61 regime the interaction correction takes the form @xmath62 if the external magnetic field is applied to the system then @xmath15 in expressions ( [ weakcond ] ) and ( [ strongcond ] ) must be substituted with @xmath63 . however , when considering the frequency dependent conductivity the equivalence between @xmath15 and zeeman energy will be lost .",
    "let us consider hopping conductivity in the presence of spin accumulation .",
    "spin dependent contribution to the hopping conductivity arises if electron hopping involves states that permit double onsite occupancy in the presence of coulomb repulsion @xcite . according to @xcite hopping rates",
    "are determined by correlation functions of occupation numbers of the sites involved in hopping .",
    "the one site density matrix is given as @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the one electron energy of localized state @xmath66 , counted from the fermi level and @xmath67 is the intra - site electron repulsion potential .",
    "expression ( [ dmatr ] ) coincides with equilibrium one for electrons in magnetic field . after mapping the approach developed in @xcite to the case of spin accumulation the hopping rate from site @xmath66 to site @xmath68",
    "can be written as sum of contributions proportional to    1 .",

    "scaling expression for the variable range hopping conductivity in this problem was obtained in @xcite . for small values of spin accumulation defined by the inequality @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the characteristic mott temperature and @xmath76 is the sample dimension , we obtain the expression for the spin accumulation @xmath15 dependent part of conductivity @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the densities of states with energies @xmath80 and @xmath81 near the fermi level correspondingly .",
    "note that in this regime @xmath82 does not depend on dimension @xmath76 .",
    "again , expression ( [ hopp ] ) has to be modified in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "spin accumulation term @xmath15 must be substituted with @xmath63 .",
    "the singularities of dos can be measured with a tunnelling probe electrode , where the singularities can reveal in the zero bias dips of the tunnelling conductivity @xcite .",
    "we note that in spin accumulation regime both sides of the tunnelling contact will acquire chemical potential shifts . in order to resolve the splitting of singularities in dos , the chemical potential splitting in the probe electrode has to be much smaller than that in the studied system .",
    "this can by achieved if one takes the probe electrode with much stronger spin relaxation compared to the spin relaxation in the studied system .",
    "let us now discuss the experimental observability of considered correlation effects .",
    "an important issue is the value of chemical potential shift @xmath15 compared to the value of the inverse spin relaxation time @xmath83 in the system .",
    "the applicability of expressions ( [ updown ] ) , ( [ weakcond ] ) and ( [ strongcond ] ) requires @xmath84 to be large .",
    "we take the spin relaxation time to be @xmath85 ps and the spin accumulation @xmath86 mev .",
    "the @xmath87 mev spin accumulation requires correspondingly low @xmath88 k temperatures .",
    "we obtain @xmath89 . also assuming the diffusion coefficient to be @xmath90 @xmath91 s@xmath92 , we estimate @xmath93 nm and @xmath94 nm . the above conditions on the magnitude of the spin relaxation length and spin accumulation are realizable experimentally in the ferromagnet - doped semiconductors contacts @xcite",
    ". however , the nature of this large value of spin accumulation is still under debate @xcite ."
