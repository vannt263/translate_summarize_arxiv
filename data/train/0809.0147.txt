    "anteneodo and morgado recently discussed an interesting one - dimensional random walk model that exhibits a phase transition @xcite . in this model , at each time step the random walker moves two lattice spacings to the right or one spacing to the left with probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the sites visited by such a walk are , depending on @xmath4 , either part of a single connected cluster of visited sites or many clusters of visited sites ( fragments ) separated by single unvisited sites . a transition from one class to the other takes place at the critical probability @xmath6 . at large times",
    ", for @xmath7 the cluster of visited sites contains no gaps , however , for @xmath8 this cluster contains a finite density of unvisited sites . using monte - carlo simulation data , a power law dependence with an exponent @xmath9",
    "was estimated for @xmath10 , the fraction of fragments with length @xmath2 . since the model is a simple one dimensional random walk that is not known to contain any such anamolous exponents , such a behaviour seems unlikely .",
    "we prove below that the correct asymptotic behaviour of @xmath10 at the critical point is @xmath11^{-1}$ ] which is infact hard to distinguish numerically from a power law dependence with exponent @xmath9 .    at large times",
    ", it is easy to see ( using the central limit theorem ) that the probability distribution of the position of the walker is a gaussian with mean @xmath12 and variance @xmath13 .",
    "when the walker is biased towards the left ( @xmath14 ) , the probability of the walker being on the left of the origin tends to @xmath15 as @xmath16 . hence the visited sites are part of a single connected cluster . when the walker is biased towards the right , in general the clusters of visited sites",
    "are separated by single unvisited sites .",
    "the fraction of visited sites @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the average number of distinct sites visited in an @xmath20-step walk and @xmath21 is the average length of an @xmath20-step walk .",
    "the fraction of unvisited sites @xmath22 , is given by @xmath23 .",
    "for this case , @xmath22 can be calculated exactly using methods outlined in @xcite,@xcite . in the large @xmath20 limit , as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "the total number of fragments in a walk is equal to the number of unvisited sites and hence @xmath27 , the average number of fragments is equal to @xmath28 .    the single unvisited sites at the edge of each fragment ensure that the probability of formation of a fragment is independent of the previous history of the walker .",
    "the walk can therefore be considered as a discrete process of independent increments where at each step a new fragment of length @xmath2 is added to the positive edge of the walk with probability @xmath1 .",
    "these probabilities are multiplicative , i.e.- the probability of formation of a fragment of length @xmath29 followed by one of length @xmath30 is @xmath31 .",
    "the number of fragments of length @xmath2 in a given walk is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total number of fragments .",
    "therefore @xmath34 and hence @xmath35 since @xmath36 .",
    "for a new fragment of length @xmath2 to be formed the walker must ( i ) be at the positive edge of the walk ( at site @xmath37 for convenience ) , ( ii ) hop over site @xmath38 and reach site @xmath2 by visiting each site between @xmath15 and @xmath2 , without visiting sites @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus at the end of each step the walker is once again at the positive edge of the walk .",
    "@xmath1 is therefore the probability of event ( ii ) occuring .",
    "hence @xmath1 is the sum of probabilities of all paths that are consistent with ( ii ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath40 , the probability of condition ( ii ) with the constraint of ` visiting every site between @xmath15 and @xmath2 ' relaxed .",
    "hence @xmath40 is the probability of starting at site @xmath37 and reaching site @xmath2 without visiting @xmath38 and @xmath39 . @xmath40",
    "thus includes the probability of formation of smaller fragments within the segment @xmath41 $ ] . for example @xmath42 . in general @xmath43",
    "this translates to the following equation involving generating functions @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "+      we calculate @xmath40 by summing over probabilities of all paths that are consistent with the above definition of @xmath40 . for example",
    ", @xmath47 simply involves the walker reaching site @xmath15 from @xmath37 by hopping over site @xmath38 .",
    "thus @xmath48 .",
    "it is also easy to see that @xmath49 is @xmath38 since unvisited sites in this walk can not be separated by two lattice sites . in the calculation of @xmath50",
    "we sum over paths in which the walker starting from @xmath37 , jumps over site @xmath38 to reach @xmath15 and then over @xmath51 to reach site @xmath52 with probability @xmath53 .",
    "once at site @xmath52 , the walker can move two leftward steps followed by a rightward step with probability @xmath54 , any number of times , to return to site @xmath52 .",
    "thus @xmath55 . generalizing this procedure of summing over",
    "all relevant walks , we derive below a closed form expression of @xmath40 in two equivalent ways .    the walk can be considered as a markov process where at each time step the walker moves either two lattice spacings to the right or one to the left with probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , independent of the previous step .",
    "the probability @xmath40 can be calculated from @xmath56 , the matrix of transition probabilities @xcite with no transitions from the sites @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath57 . for example",
    "@xmath58\\ ] ] where the rows correspond to sites [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 ] .",
    "consider the column vector @xmath59 where @xmath60 , the element in row @xmath61 , is the probability of the walker starting at site @xmath15 , being at site @xmath61 at time step @xmath62 .",
    "now @xmath59 evolves as @xmath63 which ensures that @xmath59 only contains probabilities of paths that never visit sites @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "since the walker starts at site @xmath15 , @xmath64 .",
    "we calculate @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the probability of the walker , starting from site @xmath15 being at site @xmath61 , at any time step .",
    "@xmath65 is thus the sum of @xmath59 at every time step .",
    "hence @xmath67 all walks that start at @xmath15 and end at @xmath2 ( at any time step ) contribute to @xmath40 , therefore @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "thus @xmath40 is the ( @xmath71 ) matrix element of @xmath72 .",
    "the factor @xmath4 is present because the walker must hop over site @xmath38 to reach @xmath15 as in condition ( ii ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and so on . subtituting these into eq.([generating ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and so on .",
    "alternatively , consider @xmath81 , the probability of a walker starting at site -1 , being at site @xmath61 while never visiting @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "now @xmath81 satisfies the difference equation @xmath82 with the boundary conditions @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "a general solution of @xmath81 is @xmath85 which on substitution into eq.([gs ] ) yields the cubic equation @xmath86 .",
    "the solutions to this equation are @xmath87 where @xmath88 . by satisfying boundary conditions we obtain @xmath89 \\label{gs - solution}\\ ] ] where a is a constant which is determined from the normalization condition @xmath90 . alternatively from the definition of @xmath40 as the connecting probability between @xmath37 and @xmath2 we have @xmath91    we thus have a closed form expression for @xmath40 .",
    "we verify that the two expressions for @xmath40 are equal as the matrix elements of the column corresponding to site 1 in @xmath92 satisfy the same difference equation and , with an appropriate change of variables , the same boundary conditions as g(s ) .",
    "having found the generating function , we can extract the behaviour of @xmath1 for large @xmath2 . from eq.([criticalrho ] ) , @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "we can approximate the summation in the generating function by an integral @xmath104\\rho(l)dl$ ] .",
    "the singular part of this integral can be evaluated by equating @xmath105 from which we see that @xmath106 .",
    "alternatively , from the fact that the integral @xmath107/(\\log \\",
    "l)^2dl$ ] diverges as @xmath108^{-1}(1+o[\\frac{1}{\\log \\epsilon}])$ ] we obtain @xmath109 we thus have an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath1 .",
    "cases in which the rightward steps are of length @xmath110 can be treated in a similar way . in this case",
    "the independent elements are clusters of visited and unvisited sites separated by @xmath111 zeroes .",
