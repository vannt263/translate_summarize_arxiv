    "hard exclusive electro- and muoproduction of mesons on nucleons has played an important role in studies of strong interactions and recently gained renewed interest as it allows access to generalised parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite .",
    "the gpds provide a novel and comprehensive description of the partonic structure of the nucleon and contain a wealth of new information .",
    "in particular , they embody both nucleon electromagnetic form factors and parton distribution functions . furthermore , gpds provide a description of the nucleon as an extended object , referred to as 3-dimensional nucleon tomography  @xcite , which correlates longitudinal momenta and transverse spatial degrees of freedom of partons .",
    "the evaluation of gpds may for the first time provide insight into angular momenta of quarks , another fundamental property of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the mapping of nucleon gpds , which very recently became one of the key objectives of hadron physics , requires a comprehensive program of measuring various hard exclusive processes in a broad kinematic range , in particular deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) .",
    "hard exclusive meson production provides independent and complementary information .",
    "in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , there exists a general proof of factorisation  @xcite for exclusive meson production by longitudinal virtual photons . in this case",
    "the amplitude for hard exclusive meson leptoproduction can be factorised into a hard - scattering part and soft parts , the latter depending on the structure of the nucleon described by gpds and on the structure of the meson described by its distribution amplitude ( da ) .",
    "no similar proof of factorisation exists for transverse virtual photons . however , pqcd - inspired models taking into account parton transverse momenta have been proposed @xcite , which describe reasonably well the behaviour of the cross sections for both longitudinal and transverse photons , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .    at leading twist ,",
    "meson production is described by four types of gpds : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes a quark of a given flavour or a gluon .",
    "the gpds are functions of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath16 is the squared four - momentum transfer to the nucleon , @xmath17 the average and @xmath18 half the difference of the longitudinal momenta carried by the struck parton in the initial and final states .",
    "in addition , there is a scale dependence of gpds which is not explicitly shown here .",
    "depending on the quark content and the quantum numbers of the meson , there exists sensitivity to various types of gpds and different quark flavours .",
    "in particular , production of vector mesons is sensitive only to gpds @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the gpds attracted much attention after it was shown that the total angular momentum of a given parton species @xmath15 is related to the second moment of the sum of gpds @xmath11 and @xmath12 via the ji relation @xcite : @xmath19 , \\ ] ] which holds for any value of @xmath18 .",
    "the spin - independent cross sections for dvcs and for vector meson production by longitudinal photons on a proton target are mostly sensitive to the nucleon - helicity - conserving gpds @xmath11 , with gpds @xmath12 being suppressed in the compass kinematic domain . however , the gpds @xmath20 are of special interest , as they are related to the orbital angular momentum of quarks .",
    "they describe transitions with nucleon helicity flip , in which orbital angular momentum must be involved due to total angular momentum conservation .",
    "it was pointed out that the spin dependent cross sections for dvcs on transversely polarised protons  @xcite and for exclusive vector meson production by longitudinal photons on transversely polarised nucleons  @xcite are sensitive to the ` elusive ' nucleon helicity - flip gpds @xmath12 .",
    "access to gpds @xmath12 is also possible by measurements of the cross section for dvcs on an unpolarised neutron target  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the lepton helicity dependent dvcs cross section on neutrons were performed by the jlab hall a collaboration  @xcite and the transverse target spin asymmetries for dvcs from transversely polarised protons were measured by the hermes experiment  @xcite .",
    "model - dependent estimates of the total angular momenta of quarks , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , derived from the results of these measurements , indicate a large value for @xmath21 and a value close to zero for @xmath22 , in agreement with results from lattice qcd  @xcite .    in exclusive vector meson production on",

    ", the indices @xmath23 and @xmath24 refer to the beam spin independent and transverse target spin dependent cross section , and @xmath25 indicates the type of azimuthal modulation of the cross section .",
    "the gpds @xmath12 appear at leading twist only in this azimuthal asymmetry for vector meson production by longitudinal photons .",
    "the only previous measurement of for exclusive @xmath0 electroproduction on transversely polarised protons was performed by the hermes experiment  @xcite .",
    "its separate extraction for longitudinally and transversely polarised @xmath0 mesons gave values consistent with zero .",
    "a model - dependent attempt was made  @xcite to extract the value of the total angular momentum @xmath21 of @xmath26 quarks in the proton , although limited by large experimental uncertainties .    in this paper",
    ", we present results on for exclusive @xmath0 meson muoproduction on transversely polarised protons and deuterons .",
    "the experiment was carried out at cern by the compass collaboration using the 160gev/@xmath1 muon beam and a polarised target filled either with lithium deuteride ( @xmath27lid ) or ammonia ( nh@xmath28 ) to provide polarised deuterons or protons , respectively .",
    "the cross section of hard exclusive @xmath0 leptoproduction , @xmath29 , on a transversely polarised nucleon depends on the photon virtuality @xmath30 , the bjorken variable @xmath31 , @xmath16 , @xmath32 and @xmath33  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath32 is the azimuthal angle between the lepton scattering plane and the plane containing the virtual photon and the produced meson ( hadron plane ) , while @xmath34 is the azimuthal angle of the target spin vector around the virtual photon direction relative to the lepton scattering plane ( see fig .",
    "[ angles ] ) .",
    "a summary of the kinematic variables used in this paper is given in table  [ tab : intro_1 ] .",

    "the general formula for the cross section for meson leptoproduction , which contains the dependence on the projectile and target spins and the complete azimuthal dependence , can be found in ref .",
    "the component of the transverse target spin perpendicular to the virtual photon direction , @xmath36 , is in the compass kinematic region very well approximated by the corresponding component perpendicular to the direction of the incoming muon .",
    "the virtual photon polarisation parameter @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the virtual - photon fractional energy , @xmath40 and @xmath41 the proton mass .",
    "the symbols @xmath42 represent spin - dependent photoabsorption cross sections or interference terms , which are proportional to bilinear combinations of helicity amplitudes @xmath43 for the subprocess @xmath44 , @xmath45 where the dependence on kinematic variables is omitted for brevity .",
    "the virtual - photon helicity is denoted by @xmath46 , the target nucleon helicity by @xmath47 , and the notation is restricted to @xmath48 for legibility .",
    "the transverse target spin dependent cross section is accessed experimentally by measuring the azimuthal asymmetry , which is proportional to the @xmath49 moment of the cross section for a transversely polarised target .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath50 the denominator contains the spin - averaged cross section with contributions from both transverse and longitudinal virtual photons .",
    "the leading twist interference term @xmath51 corresponds to @xmath52 production by longitudinal photons , while the higher twist term @xmath53 corresponds to production by transverse photons .",
    "the former term is proportional to a weighted sum of convolutions of the gpds @xmath20 with the da of the produced meson and a hard scattering kernel  @xcite .",
    "the weights depend on the contributions of quarks of various flavours and gluons to the production of a given vector meson .",
    "the direct method to separate terms arising from production by longitudinal and transverse photons is the rosenbluth separation .",
    "however , it is not feasible with the present data as only measurements at one beam energy are available . in ref .",
    "@xcite another method was proposed which can be used for vector meson production in the approximation of @xmath54-channel helicity conservation and exploiting the decay angular distributions of the meson .",
    "it was applied by hermes for the analysis of @xmath0 production on transversely polarised protons . in our analysis",
    "we do not attempt such a separation .",
    "nevertheless , the present ` unseparated ' results can be compared to the predictions of existing models which take into account also higher twist effects .",

    "the beam traverses a polarised solid - state target which contains 120 cm total length of polarisable material , which is either nh@xmath28 for polarised protons or @xmath59lid for polarised deuterons .",
    "both protons and deuterons can be polarised either longitudinally or transversely with respect to the beam direction .",
    "a mixture of liquid @xmath60he and @xmath61he , used to refrigerate the target , and a small admixture of other nuclei are also present in the target .",
    "it consists of either three ( nh@xmath28 ) or two ( @xmath59lid ) separate cells with polarisable material , placed one after another along the beam .",
    "the spin directions in neighbouring cells are opposite .",
    "both target configurations allow for a simultaneous measurement of azimuthal asymmetries for the two target spin directions to compensate flux - dependent systematic uncertainties . in order to reduce systematic effects of the acceptance ,",
    "the spin directions are reversed periodically about every week with polarisation measurements before and after reversal .",
    "the three - cell configuration results in a more balanced acceptance for cells with opposite polarisation , which leads to a further reduction of systematic effects .",
    "the achieved polarisation , @xmath62 , is about 0.8 for protons ( nh@xmath28 ) and 0.5 for deuterons ( @xmath59lid ) with relative uncertainties of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
