    "recently , a few electron events in the channel @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the long lived neutral @xmath5 meson , have been observed @xcite . the same experiment sees thousands of muon events , @xmath6 .",
    "one of the experimental acceptance conditions is that the invariant mass of the two leptons be within a few mev of the @xmath5 mass .",
    "this means events are lost if a photon of sufficient energy is also emitted , _",
    "i.e._@xmath7,with @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "our purpose is to estimate the size of this radiative correction by calculating @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the rate for @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the rate for @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the square of the lepton invariant mass , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the momenta of the lepton and antilepton .",
    "the @xmath5 mass is denoted by @xmath19 , the lepton mass by @xmath20 and @xmath21 is an experimental parameter . in the next section ,",
    "we examine a tree level model which treats the meson - lepton interaction as a point coupling .",
    "section iii contains results for a model in which the meson - lepton point interaction is replaced by a loop diagram with two photons in the intermediate state .",
    "we conclude with a comparison of the two approaches .",
    "corrections to @xmath22 are presented in an appendix .",
    "the differential decay width @xmath23 has been calculated in a simple model @xcite where the meson - lepton coupling is taken to be a pseudoscalar interaction with an effective coupling constant @xmath24 .",
    "this leads to a transition amplitude @xmath25 of the form @xmath26 as illustrated in fig.1 . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the photon polarization vector and @xmath28 is the photon momentum .",
    "unfortunately the result is given only in the limit @xmath29 , a condition that is clearly not satisfied for @xmath5 decay into muons .",
    "the extension to include terms of all orders in @xmath30 is straightforward and we find that eq.([point ] ) gives a differential decay width for @xmath31 of the form @xmath32\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .",

    "all the experimental results announced so far @xcite find the rate for @xmath43 to be near the theoretical lower limit given by multiplying the rate for @xmath44 by the rate for @xmath45 @xmath46 ^ 2\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 the rate for @xmath48 as given in @xcite is larger than the unitarity bound given by eq.([kggmumu ] ) and consistent with predictions from chiral perturbation theory @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , it seems reasonable , in attempting to extend the calculation of eq.([intrate ] ) beyond the result obtained using eq.([point ] ) , to calculate the absorptive part of @xmath49 diagrams shown in fig.2 .",
    "in particular the box diagram takes us beyond simple bremsstrahlung off external legs . like eq.([kggmumu ] ) , the bremsstrahlung pole terms of fig.(2 ) , which vary as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the photon energy , contain a factor of the lepton mass .",
    "it has been suggested that the terms which vary as @xmath51 to a positive power might not include a lepton mass factor and could thus be anomalously large @xcite .",
    "to evaluate the diagrams of fig.2 , we take the @xmath5-photon - photon effective lagrangian to be @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the photon field tensor , @xmath54 is its dual , @xmath55 is the @xmath56 field and @xmath57 is a constant .",
    "this leads to the vertex function @xmath58 where @xmath28 and @xmath59 are the photon momenta . in general",
    ", this expression can also include a form factor which depends on @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the implications of including this additional factor are discussed below .    in this case , the expression for @xmath23 is very complicated and we will not attempt to write it out .",
    "the box graph involves integrals of the form @xmath62\\,\\left[(q+p+k)^2-m^2\\right]\\ , ( q+ p)^2}.\\ ] ] the triangle graphs involve similar integrals with one or two factors of @xmath63 in the numerator and either the second or third factor in the denominator of eq.([boxint ] ) omitted .",
    "these integrals can be expanded in terms of the external momenta as outlined in the appendix of passarino and veltman @xcite .",
    "the momentum expansion and its scalar coefficients are given by a computer code called loop @xcite which is a slight modification of a code written by veltman called form factor .",
    "within this code the integrals are evaluated in terms of spence functions as defined above and these functions are then evaluated numerically .",
    "once the amplitudes are determined they are squared and summed over spin , including the photon polarization , in the usual way . to check for errors we replace the photon polarization by its momentum and look for gauge invariance .",
    "this is our only real check but it is a very powerful one since gauge invariance requires a delicate cancellation among the three diagrams @xcite .    the real part of the amplitudes diverges because the effective coupling eq.([kgg ] ) has dimension 5 .",
    "the absorptive part has several contributions : @xmath64 followed by @xmath65 as well as @xmath66 followed by @xmath67 .",
    "this is illustrated by the cut diagrams of fig.3 . in the first of these diagrams , the intermediate photons are on - shell ( @xmath68 ) , which is equivalent to our assumption that @xmath69 is constant . in the second ,",
    "one of the photons is virtual , and the effective coupling has the general form @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a form factor normalized to @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculation of the complete absorptive part can not separate these contributions , so we have effectively assumed @xmath73 throughout .",
    "this assumption is justified in the case of electrons , since the form factor correction to the width of the dalitz decay @xmath74 is only a few percent due to the preference for low @xmath75 invariant mass . for the muon case ,",
    "the form factor correction to the dalitz decay width is 20 - 25% @xcite , and there could be a discernable effect in the one loop contributions to @xmath23 .",
    "in figs.4 , 5 and 6 , we show the differential width obtained from the absorptive part of the one - loop calculation as a function of the lepton invariant mass , @xmath15 , for @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . for comparison",
    "we also plot eqs.([diffrate ] ) and ( [ polerate ] ) .",
    "the result of the loop calculation is almost the same as bergstrm s differential width , as modified by us to include the lepton mass , and both differ substantially from the  model independent \" width where only the @xmath79 terms are kept .    in tables",
    "i , ii , and iii we give the integrated width , eq.(1 ) , for several values of @xmath21 . again",
    "the result from the loop calculation is very similar to that given by eq.([f ] ) and quite different from that given by eq.([fpole ] ) . for electrons",
    "the correction is large , but not anomalously so , and there is no indication that the diagrams of fig.2 are not proportional to the lepton mass .    the moral would seem to be that , except for very small invariant masses , the more complicated calculation of the loop model of sec.iii is unnecessary and eqs.([diffrate ] ) and ( [ int ] ) are sufficient . we have made no attempt to calculate the radiative corrections within the acceptance bin , @xmath80 .",
    "for the model of sec.ii bergstrm @xcite has given a complete expression for the correction from virtual photons .",
    "this , together with eq.([diffrate ] ) , is all that is needed . to calculate the virtual corrections for the model of sec.iii",
    "is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank jack ritchie for drawing our attention to this problem , for many discussions , and for preliminary versions of tables i and ii and figs.4 and 5 .",
