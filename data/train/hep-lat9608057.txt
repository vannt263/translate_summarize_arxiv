    "lattice qcd at finite baryon density holds the key to an understanding of the phase transition between quark - confined hadronic matter and the quark - gluon plasma . at zero temperature",
    "we expect this transition to occur at @xmath5 corresponding to the lowest lying state with non - zero baryon number . + the fact that the fermion determinant becomes complex when @xmath6 is non - zero makes numerical simulations particularly difficult .",
    "simulations using the quenched theory @xcite give the physically misleading result that as the quark mass tends to zero , the lowest lying state with non - zero baryon number becomes massless .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath7 .",
    "recent work by stephanov @xcite using the random matrix method has provided a solution to this particular problem by demonstrating that at nonzero @xmath6 the quenched theory is not a simple @xmath8 limit of a theory with @xmath9 quarks .",
    "this explanation implies that the phase of the determinant is important for a simulation of full qcd at finite @xmath6",
    ". however earlier work on the full theory at strong coupling @xcite indicates that the transition still occurs at @xmath10 .",
    "the gcpf can be expressed as an ensemble average of the fermionic determinant normalised with respect to the fermionic determinant at @xmath11 .",
    "this means that our probability weighting factor is well - defined .",
    "@xmath12[du^\\dagger]det m(\\mu)e^{-s_g[u , u^\\dagger]}}\\over { \\int [ du][du^\\dagger]det m(\\mu=0)e^{-s_g[u , u^\\dagger]}}}\\ ] ]    which leads to : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the pure gauge action and @xmath15 is the kogut - susskind fermion matrix : @xmath16    @xmath17 contains all the spacelike gauge links and the bare quark mass and @xmath18 all the forward timelike links . on each given configuration of the gauge fields @xmath19",
    "is expanded as a polynomial in the fugacity variable with powers ranging between @xmath20 $ ] ( @xmath21 corresponding to the spatial extent of the lattice ) .",
    "the ensemble averages of the coefficients of this normalised expansion are the corresponding expansion coefficients for the gcpf .",
    "the gauge field configurations are generated using hybrid monte carlo , with the expansion coefficients of @xmath19 obtained from the eigenvalues of the propagator matrix @xmath22 ( gibbs @xcite ) @xmath23 thus ( for @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 @xmath26    the eigenvalues , @xmath27 , of @xmath22 have a @xmath28 symmetry and a @xmath27 and @xmath29 symmetry , which leads to an expansion of the form : @xmath30      in the pure gauge theory we have @xmath31 equivalent vacua related by @xmath32 rotations .",
    "tunnelling between the different @xmath3 vacua is much more probable in the confined sector than in the deconfined sector .",
    "since the pure - gauge action as well as the integration measure are invariant under the @xmath3 transformation , the gcpf can also be written as : @xmath33[du^\\dagger]det m(\\mu+z_3/n_t)e^{-s_g[u , u^\\dagger]}}\\over { \\int [ du][du^\\dagger]det m(\\mu=0)e^{-s_g[u , u^\\dagger]}}}\\ ] ] averaging over the three @xmath3 vacua would eliminate the triality non - zero coefficients and , since @xmath34 , the sum of the triality zero coefficients should tend to 1 . as fig .",
    "1 shows , at @xmath2 and @xmath35 , we obtained a clear signal for z(3 ) tunnelling .",
    "the sum of the triality zero coefficients shows a strong tendency to average to 1 whilst those of the triality one and two coefficients each tend to zero .",
    "this is consistent with simulating in the confined phase at @xmath11 as expected at this coupling and quark mass .",
    "= 5.5 cm      we consider a description of the system in terms of the canonical partition functions for fixed particle number .",
    "this technique allows us to include only those triality zero coefficients which , at the end of the simulation , are positive and have a reasonable error.the chemical potential as a function of the baryon number density is obtained from the local derivative of the energy , @xmath36 , of the state with @xmath9 fermions with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fermion density , @xmath39 .",
    "= 5.5 cm    in fig .",
    "2 we show the number density , at @xmath2 , @xmath35 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 lattices , as a function of chemical potential . only the dependence at low densities",
    "is shown as it is only the coefficients @xmath40 for @xmath9 small which are determined with reasonable statistical error .",
    "there is little difference between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 number densities .",
    "the onset of non - zero baryon number density at @xmath41 is unexpectedly low .",
    "therefore we have also considered the chemical potential ( the onset @xmath6 ) required to make the level with 3 quarks equally probable with the zero quark level .",
    "this ad - hoc definition takes account of the fact that the lowest coefficients are the most accurately determined and allows errors to be estimated directly .",
    "3 shows the quark mass dependence of the onset @xmath6 .",
    "note that , from a study of the lee - yang zeros in the complex m - plane , we expect the system to undergo a ` deconfinement transition ' in the region @xmath42 on a @xmath0 lattice at @xmath2 .",
    "the scaling with @xmath43 is clearly preferred , consistent with the onset of the transition being controlled , in part , by a goldstone boson .",
    "lattice qcd at finite baryon density continues to exhibit a phase transition inconsistent with @xmath44 despite the inclusion of the complex fermion determinant .",
    "it may well be that a successful formulation of qcd at finite density must override the effects of a goldstone boson .",
