    "spin correlation and orbital angular momentum in the open - shell @xmath5 transition metals lead to a large variety of electronic ground states , magnetic coupling , or chemical reactivity already in diatomic molecules .",
    "@xcite the complexity of the electronic structure of @xmath5 diatomics is further reflected in a number of conflicting results from theoretical predictions and experimental studies @xcite on the electronic ground states of fe@xmath6 and co@xmath6 that have extensively been discussed in the literature .",
    "@xcite the current agreement among theory for neutral fe@xmath6 and co@xmath6 diatomic molecules is on @xmath7 and @xmath8 ground states , respectively .",
    "@xcite experimental data , on the other hand , has resisted to yield a conclusive picture .",
    "@xcite from a different point of view , the possibility of aligning molecules in magnetic fields @xcite and the question of the fundamental limits of the magnetic anisotropy energy that is responsible for a preferred axis of alignment of the magnetic moment naturally lead to diatomic molecules of @xmath5 transition elements and their complexes .",
    "@xcite again , the predicted magnetic anisotropy energy relies on an accurate determination of the electronic states and their relative energies . at present",
    "there is only limited experimental information on the spin and orbital magnetic moments of gaseous @xmath5 transition - metal molecules or molecular ions . in particular for free fe@xmath1 and",
    "co@xmath1 only the bond dissociation energies are known experimentally  @xcite available theoretical results predict @xmath9 , @xmath10 , or @xmath11 ground states @xcite for fe@xmath1 as well as @xmath12 or @xmath13 ground states @xcite for co@xmath1 . in conflict with these predictions , we here present @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 candidates for the electronic ground state of fe@xmath1 , as well as the @xmath0 electronic ground state of co@xmath1 as determined by gas - phase x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) spectroscopy  @xcite that was only recently introduced for free molecular ions .",
    "@xcite all states that are found in our study carry significant orbital angular momentum that disagrees with theoretical preferences for @xmath14 states .",
    "molecular ions are produced by magnetron sputtering of high - purity ( 99.95  % ) iron or cobalt sputtering targets with argon ( 99.9999  % ) at @xmath15  sccm flow rate and helium ( 99.9999  % ) buffer gas at @xmath16  sccm flow rate in a liquid - nitrogen cooled gas - aggregation cluster source .",
    "@xcite during formation , these ions are cooled to @xmath17 k by multiple collisions with buffer gas atoms at @xmath18  mbar stagnation pressure .",
    "this allows for depopulation of excited states .",
    "the ions are collected at the source exit by a radio - frequency hexapole ion guide and are transmitted through a differential pumping stage into a radio - frequency quadrupole mass filter .",
    "after mass selection , fe@xmath1 or co@xmath1 diatomic molecular cations are accumulated in a liquid - helium cooled linear ion trap and are thermalized to @xmath19  k by collisions with helium buffer gas at @xmath20  mbar , equivalent to a helium atom number density of @xmath21  @xmath22 .",
    "the ion trap housing was kept at a temperature of @xmath23  k but the resulting ion temperature will in any case be higher than the ion trap housing or electrode temperature because of inevitable radio - frequency heating @xcite that competes with collisional cooling and sensitively depends on buffer gas and radio - frequency parameters . further relaxation of any remaining excited electronic state is achieved by typical storage ( half - life ) times of the parent ions on the order of @xmath24  s in the ion trap .",
    "@xcite an elliptically polarized and monochromatic soft x - ray beam , delivered by variable polarization undulator beam line ue52-pgm / sgm of the synchrotron radiation facility bessy  ii , is coupled in along the axis of the ion trap .",

    "this fe@xmath31 or co@xmath31 ion yield is recorded at every photon energy step with an in - line reflectron time - of - flight mass spectrometer and is normalized to the incident photon flux as detected with a gaasp photodiode . for xmcd spectroscopy",
    ", the ion trap is placed inside the homogeneous magnetic field ( @xmath32  t ) of a superconducting solenoid .",
    "@xcite following the standard procedures , the xmcd spectrum is obtained as the difference of x - ray absorption spectra that are recorded with parallel and antiparallel orientation of the photon helicity relative to the direction of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the isotropic x - ray absorption spectrum is obtained by taking the average of the spectra of both photon helicities .",
    "xmcd sum rules @xcite are applied to these spectra to derive expectation values of spin and orbital angular momentum in the ensemble average .",
    "while the orbital angular momentum sum rule @xcite of x - ray magnetic circular dichroism can be applied without complications , the spin sum rule @xcite potentially contains contributions of the magnetic dipole term @xmath33 and therefore delivers an effective spin magnetic moment @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "this magnetic dipole term @xmath33 is a second order multipole contribution that is related to the difference of the quadrupole moments of the charge distributions for spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "a sizable @xmath33 contribution to the spin sum rule can be observed if the absolute value of @xmath36 is large and the experiment is performed in a non - isotropic geometry .",
    "this is typically the case for surfaces and thin films .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : xs_fe2andco2 ] the @xmath25 x - ray absorption and xmcd spectra of fe@xmath1 and co@xmath1 at @xmath38  t in the 4  k ion trap are shown along with the xmcd spectra , integrated with respect to photon energy , to which the xmcd sum rules @xcite are applied .",
    "the spectral shape of x - ray absorption in both cases is identical to that recorded at higher ion trap temperature of @xmath39  k without applied magnetic field ,  @xcite i.e. , no temperature or magnetic field dependence of the x - ray absorption spectrum was observed . even though some multiplet structure @xcite is still visible in the @xmath25 x - ray absorption spectra of the diatomic molecular cations , it is not as well resolved as in the corresponding atomic or cationic spectra .",

    "are displayed on the same scale within each panel , normalized to the non - resonant photoionization intensity at photon energies well above the @xmath40-edge .",
    "these raw xmcd spectra reflect the magnetization per unoccupied @xmath5 state at our experimental conditions but not the total magnetic moment .",
    "the large value of the integrated xmcd above the @xmath40 absorption edge indicates significant orbital magnetization in both cases . ]    application of the xmcd sum rules  @xcite to these spectra results in orbital @xmath41 and effective spin @xmath42 magnetizations per unoccupied @xmath5 state at our experimental conditions of @xmath43  @xmath44 and @xmath45  @xmath44 for fe@xmath1 , and @xmath46  @xmath44 and @xmath47  @xmath44 for co@xmath1 . already at this stage",
    "our experimental study shows significant orbital contributions to the total magnetization and clearly excludes @xmath14 ground states for fe@xmath1 and co@xmath1 .",
    "inherent to the application of xmcd sum rules , the experimental ratios of orbital - to - spin magnetic moments are only limited by statistical uncertainties and a possible contribution of the magnetic dipole term , but not by the number @xmath48 of unoccupied @xmath5 states , the ion temperature , or the degree of circular polarization of the incident photon beam .",
    "because of the high confidence in this value , the following analysis of the electronic ground states will be primarily based on this ratio of orbital - to - spin magnetization .",
    "our experimental data yields values of @xmath49 for fe@xmath1 and @xmath50 for co@xmath1 .",
    "in general , a @xmath52 and a @xmath53 molecular configuration can be assumed for fe@xmath1 and co@xmath1 , respectively , since a molecular @xmath54 configuration with a two - electron @xmath55 bond should be energetically favorable over a @xmath56 configuration with an additional singly occupied antibonding @xmath57 orbital .",
    "@xcite these molecular electronic configurations correspond to @xmath58 and @xmath59 unoccupied @xmath5 states per atom . with these values and the experimentally determined magnetization per @xmath5 hole , we obtain the magnetization per atom as @xmath60  @xmath44 and @xmath61  @xmath44 for fe@xmath1 , and @xmath62  @xmath44 and @xmath63  @xmath44 for co@xmath1 .",

    "@xcite in this anisotropic situation , possible contributions of the magnetic dipole term @xmath33 to the effective spin magnetization @xcite have to be considered , because these could affect the experimental ratio of orbital - to - effective - spin magnetization .",
    "@xcite in cylindrical symmetry , the magnetic dipole term has components parallel ( @xmath86 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath87 ) to the molecular axis , with @xmath88 .",
    "these will cancel out in the angular average of freely rotating states . in non - fully aligned pendular states @xcite",
    ", both @xmath86 and @xmath87 will contribute to the effective spin with their opposite signs , resulting in a low effective @xmath33 . to estimate a possible contribution of @xmath33 to @xmath84 ,",
    "we start from the maximum value of @xmath33 that is present in the free atom . this value will be reduced by the formation of bonds .",
    "we therefore estimate @xmath33 in the molecular ion to be @xmath89 of the average of the absolute values in the asymptotic atomic and ionic contributions , which are @xmath90 for @xmath91 ; @xmath92 for @xmath93 ; and @xmath94 for @xmath95 configurations .",
    "@xcite in addition , we take an incomplete alignment of the molecular axis into account by further reduction to @xmath96 of these values .",
    "we thus consider @xmath97 per atom for fe@xmath1 and @xmath98 per atom for co@xmath1 .",
    "these estimates are in agreement with predictions for @xmath33 in free - standing and supported monatomic wires .",
    "@xcite an additional complication could arise from non - integer occupation numbers in the @xmath5 derived states because of a possible mixing of @xmath99 and @xmath100 orbitals . since only spin but no orbital angular momentum can be transferred between @xmath99 and @xmath100 states , this would again affect the observed ratio of orbital - to - effective - spin magnetization .",
    "electron transfer between @xmath99 and @xmath100 states could occur in either direction and can be taken into account as an additional variation @xmath101 of the effective spin .",
    "we estimate the transfer of 0.5 electrons as an upper limit per molecule , equivalent to an additional contribution of @xmath102 to the effective spin per atom , which is added to the @xmath103 contribution .",
    "this leads to a total of @xmath104 per atom for fe@xmath1 and @xmath105 per atom for co@xmath1 . with this estimate , the @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) , @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , @xmath3",
    "( @xmath110 ) , and @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , states of fe@xmath1 as well as the @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) state of co@xmath1 would have to be considered as additional candidates for the electronic ground states .",
    "our estimate is a conservative one because it takes into account both , maximum @xmath33 and maximum @xmath115 electron transfer contributions at the same time . for co@xmath1",
    ", one might even expect a cancellation of @xmath33 because of the opposite signs of @xmath33 in @xmath93 and @xmath95 configurations .",
    "@xcite      all candidate states can be assessed by the ion temperature at which they would match the experimentally determined magnetization .",
    "this ion temperature is obtained from an effective zeeman - hamiltonian @xcite in hund s coupling case ( a ) of the rotating molecular ion in a magnetic field .",
    "an equilibrium distance of 2.0   was used to estimate the rotational constants .",
    "this estimate is based on the existing experimental values @xcite of @xmath116   and @xmath117   and predicted values @xcite of @xmath118  and @xmath119  , for which no experimental data exist .",
    "the @xmath10 state of fe@xmath1 that is predicted to have an equilibrium distance of @xmath120   , significantly larger than in the other states ,  @xcite is not considered here since we can clearly rule out @xmath14 states from our non - vanishing orbital magnetization .",
    "hund s case ( a ) should apply here @xcite because of non - vanishing orbital angular momentum , a spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath121 on the order of 10 mev , and a rotational constant @xmath122 on the order of 10 @xmath123ev such that @xmath124 at our experimental conditions . because of the smaller experimental error for orbital than for spin magnetization and because of a possible @xmath33 contribution to the effective spin sum rule , we have calculated @xmath125 as @xmath126 for each @xmath127 candidate state rather than @xmath128 to determine the ion temperature in the following . for fe@xmath1 the ion temperatures that would correspond to the candidate states are @xmath129  k , @xmath130  k , @xmath131  k , @xmath132  k , @xmath133  k , and @xmath134  k. for co@xmath1 the corresponding ion temperatures are @xmath135  k , and @xmath136  k. the @xmath106 and @xmath108 states of fe@xmath1 can be discarded as they would correspond to ion temperatures below the ion trap temperature of 4  k. likewise , the @xmath113 state of co@xmath1 would correspond to an unrealistically low radio - frequency heating of only 2  k , whereas the @xmath111 state of fe@xmath1 would indicate unrealistically high radio - frequency heating of 33  k. of the remaining states , @xmath2 and @xmath3 for fe@xmath1 and @xmath0 for co@xmath1 correspond to a radio - frequency heating of @xmath137  k , which is in reasonable agreement with what we have observed for the cr@xmath1 , mn@xmath1 , and mn@xmath138 molecular ions at similar experimental conditions .",
    "@xcite the @xmath4 state of fe@xmath1 would correspond to a radio - frequency heating of 22  k , which is higher than expected at our experimental conditions but can not be ruled out .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath2 state of fe@xmath1 with @xmath139 unoccupied @xmath5 derived states per atom can only be reached if there is an unoccupied majority spin state , i.e. , if the spin polarization per @xmath5 hole is @xmath140 .",
    "for co@xmath1 with @xmath141 the majority spin states are completely filled and the spin polarization per unoccupied @xmath5 derived state is equal to 1 , as would also be the case for the @xmath142 spin states of fe@xmath1 . in summary , we have determined the ground state of co@xmath1 as @xmath0 . for fe@xmath1 we can narrow down the range of candidates for the ground state to @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "even though diatomic molecules and molecular ions of the @xmath5 transition elements have been extensively treated computationally over the last decades ,  @xcite often as benchmark systems , the ground states of many of these species have not been identified unambiguously because of computational challenges and because of the lack of experimental confirmation .",
    "most of the available theoretical studies on iron and cobalt diatomics treat neutral molecules , with fewer predictions available for the diatomic cations .",
    "one assumption that is often made to lower the computational demand",
    "when predicting the electronic ground state of diatomic molecular cations is that the spin multiplicities of the neutral and the cationic ground state differ only by @xmath143 , i.e. that the ground state of the molecular cation can be reached from the neutral molecule in a one - electron process .",
    "the di - iron molecular cation has been modeled by density functional theory at different levels , which predict either an @xmath11 ground state @xcite or a @xmath10 ground state @xcite , whereas recent multireference configuration interaction studies of fe@xmath1 predict an @xmath9 ground state .",
    "@xcite comparison with our experimentally determined @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 candidate states shows that theory underestimates the orbital degeneracy of the ground state in the case of fe@xmath1 . for density",
    "functional theory this discrepancy might be attributed to the difficulty of treating orbital angular momentum and electron correlation in @xmath5 transition elements , while in the multireference configuration interaction approach the reason might be in the restriction to @xmath142 and @xmath144 spin states @xcite when taking the @xmath145 spin state of neutral fe@xmath6 and the assumption of ionization as a one - electron process a starting points . however",
    ", none of our experimentally determined candidate states can be reached from the currently accepted @xmath7 ground state @xcite of neutral fe@xmath6 in a one - electron transition .",
    "similar results have also been obtained experimentally for the cases of chromium and manganese .",
    "@xcite we therefore propose to follow an unrestricted and unbiased theoretical approach in the search of the electronic ground state .",
    "in contrast to fe@xmath1 for which the only experimental data that is available is the bond dissociation energy @xcite , an attempt has been made to assign the electronic ground state of co@xmath1 from matrix - isolation electron spin resonance spectroscopy at 2  k in a neon matrix .",
    "@xcite the observed electron spin resonance signal was interpreted to arise from a @xmath12 state which agrees on the multiplicity but disagrees on the orbital degeneracy with the @xmath0 state identified as the ground state in our work .",
    "this discrepancy might arise from the selective sensitivity of electron spin resonance spectroscopy to an excited @xmath14 state of co@xmath1 as this state was only observed if the matrix was not annealed .",
    "@xcite the few existing density functional theory studies on cationic co@xmath1 consistently predict a ground - state spin multiplicity of @xmath146 in agreement with the experimental results presented here .",
    "however , the calculations predict @xmath14 or @xmath147 symmetry of the ground state .  @xcite both symmetries can be excluded from our experimental result .",
    "in contrast to the case of fe@xmath1 , the @xmath0 ground state of co@xmath1 could in principle be connected to the predicted @xmath148 ground state @xcite of neutral co@xmath6 via a one - electron process , namely by the removal of a @xmath149 minority electron .",
    "the experimentally determined @xmath0 ground state of co@xmath1 as well as the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 candidates for the ground state of fe@xmath1 disagree with state - of - the art multireference configuration interaction @xcite and density functional theory @xcite predictions .",
    "these results underline the importance of electronic correlation effects and orbital angular momentum in @xmath5 transition elements .",
    "our results add further evidence to the finding that the ground states of neutral and cationic diatomic molecules of the @xmath5 transition elements are not necessarily connected by one - electron processes . instead , spin or orbital angular momentum can change significantly upon ionization .",
    "this is similar to the configuration change in the atomic and cationic ground states of the @xmath5 elements vanadium , cobalt , and nickel that are not linked by one - electron processes either .",
    "the restriction to states that can be directly connected to the ground state should therefore be lifted in theoretical approaches for an unbiased search of the ground state even though this will increase the computational demand .",
