    "[ type2 ] .",
    "thus , leaving aside the variation of @xmath22 with temperature this gives in both cases @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the superfluid density .",

    "the motivation for this analysis was that dissipation should set in when the surface magnetic field reaches @xmath8 for type i superconductors or @xmath9 for type ii superconductors .",
    "however we will see below it is more subtle than this .    for the case",
    "when @xmath15 , these equations were shown to be well satisfied for a wide range of superconductors including metals , oxides , cuprates , heavy fermions , ferro - pnictides , borocarbides , fullerenes and mgb@xmath26 . however , when @xmath27 then @xmath4 adopts a thickness dependence which is well approximated by a multiplicative term @xmath28 in eqs .",

    "this factor takes the limits of @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",

    "we present a further generalization of the model based on bcs theory and the so - called @xmath41-model @xcite for strong - coupling to show that absolute values of the basic thermodynamic parameters @xmath42 , @xmath11 , @xmath43 and @xmath5 can be extracted by fitting the self - field critical current density for single- and multi - band superconductors with various topologies , including cylindrical symmetry .",

    "moreover , for type i superconductors we find that irrespective of whether @xmath32 or @xmath27 the onset of dissipation under self - field transport occurs when the surface current density reaches the depairing current density , whereas it is only for @xmath44 that this coincides with the surface field reaching @xmath8 .",

    "a type i superconductor dissipation will set in either when @xmath106 or when @xmath107 , the london depairing current density .",
    "it is easy to see that for @xmath96 these dissipation onset criteria are identical .",
    "but for @xmath98 the current - density limit is reached before the field limit .",
    "so in general we focus only on the _ local _ current limit @xmath108 for which the critical value , @xmath2 , of @xmath109 is @xmath110    we note that @xmath111 effectively takes the value 1 for all @xmath112 and not just for @xmath113 , thus leaving @xmath114 pretty much over the entire sub - penetration - depth length scale .",

    "<S> key questions for any superconductor include : what is its maximum dissipation - free electrical current ( its ` critical current ' ) and can this be used to extract fundamental thermodynamic parameters ? </S>",
    "<S> present models focus on depinning of magnetic vortices and implicate materials engineering to maximise pinning performance . </S>",
    "<S> but recently we showed that the _ self - field _ </S>",
    "<S> critical current for thin films is a universal property , independent of microstructure , controlled only by the penetration depth . </S>",
    "<S> here we generalise this observation to include thin films , wires or nanowires of single- or multi - band @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> using extended bcs theory we consider dissipation - free _ self - field _ transport currents as meissner - london currents , avoiding the concept of pinning altogether . </S>",
    "<S> we find quite generally , for type i or type ii superconductors , the current is limited by the relevant critical field divided by the penetration depth . </S>",
    "<S> our fits to 62 available data sets , from zinc nanowires to compressed sulphur hydride with critical temperatures of 0.65 to 203 k , respectively , are excellent . extracted london penetration depths , superconducting energy gaps and specific heat jumps agree well with reported bulk values . for multiband or multiphase samples we accurately recover individual band contributions and phase fractions .    the occurrence of a critical current density , @xmath2 , was initially proposed to be due to a depairing mechanism - the breaking of cooper pairs by the doppler shift arising from the velocity of the superfluid @xcite . however , the associated depairing critical current density , @xmath3 , is so high for type ii superconductors that it has never been convincingly demonstrated in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> there are still expectations , that in the case of nanofilaments , which are too small to contain a vortex , these high current densities may potentially be registered . </S>",
    "<S> but in larger samples ( which encompasses about the entire inventory of data in the literature ) this discrepancy seems to insist on different mechanisms of current limitation , chiefly those involved in abrikosov flux pinning . </S>",
    "<S> even so , calculations of the energy gain due to abrikosov vortex pinning @xcite also lead to remarkably high @xmath2 values that were not observed in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> other vortex depinning mechanisms beyond simple lorenz force depinning have been proposed , including thermally - activated depinning @xcite together with other non - vortex mechanisms such as thermally - activated phase slip @xcite and quantum phase slip @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these have been applied variously for three dimensional ( 3d ) , quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) and quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) topologies . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , none of these mechanisms explain , still less provide a universal quantitative treatment for , the observed self - field critical current density , @xmath4 , in a wide variety of superconductors across these different topologies and over the full temperature range from near absolute zero up to @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> this may well be understandable , at least in terms of traditional vortex models . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the present work we show that , despite conventional expectations , this universal goal can be achieved using a meissner - london model in which transport becomes dissipative when the surface current density reaches the depairing magnitude , @xmath6 , for type i superconductors or @xmath7 for type ii superconductors . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is the thermodynamic critical field and @xmath9 the lower critical field . as such </S>",
    "<S> , we emphasise that this represents a fundamental current - density limit not necessarily a surface - critical - field limit . in either case </S>",
    "<S> the model allows the self - field critical current density to be expressed purely in terms of @xmath10 and , for type ii superconductors , without any reference to vortex depinning . </S>",
    "<S> we use an extended bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) model to calculate the magnitude of the superconducting gap and , from its temperature dependence , the superfluid density and @xmath11 from which we calculate and fit a very wide range of data sets ( 62 in total ) for @xmath4 . these fits allow the penetration depth , superconducting energy gap , @xmath12=0 ) , and the relative jump in electronic specific heat , @xmath13 , to be determined in a manner which is simple and direct , in stark contrast to the more conventional methods for measuring these quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the test of the model is whether the fit parameters , especially the ground - state penetration depth @xmath14 , correspond accurately to independently measured values . </S>",
    "<S> this test is astonishingly well met over all superconductor types and for @xmath14 values extending over more than an order of magnitude . </S>"
