    "the superposition principle is a fundamental ingredient of quantum theory , resulting in interference phenomena not existing in classical mechanics . in atomic , molecular , and optical physics",
    "this striking feature of quantum mechanics can be studied within several examples of simple quantum systems : a trapped ion , a diatomic molecule and a single electromagnetic field mode in a cavity or free space . in this context schleich and",
    "wheeler @xcite developed a phase space picture of quantum interference .",
    "they demonstrated in the semiclassical limit , that quantum mechanical transition probabilities are governed by a set of simple rules in the phase space : a probability amplitude is given by a sum of overlap areas , with phase factors defined by an area caught between the states .",
    "recent developments in quantum optics have generated significantly increased interest in the phase space representation of quantum states , providing feasible schemes for measuring the wigner functions of a single light mode @xcite , the vibrational manifold of a diatomic molecule @xcite , and the motional state of a trapped atom @xcite , or an atomic beam @xcite .",
    "these advances open up new possibilities in experimental studies of the quantum superposition principle , as the wigner function provides direct insight into the interference phenomena through its fringes and negativities , and also completely characterizes the quantum state .",
    "additionally , negativity of the wigner function is a strong evidence for the distinctness of quantum mechanics from classical statistical theory .",
    "consequently , it is now possible to obtain full information on the coherence properties of a quantum state by measuring its wigner function , instead of observing quantum interference only as fringes in marginal distributions of single observables .",
    "therefore , schemes for generating quantum states with nontrivial phase space quasidistributions , especially those possessing substantial negativities , are of considerable interest . the system that appears to provide the most opportunities currently is a trapped ion",
    ", whose quantum state can be quite easily manipulated through interaction with suitably applied laser beams @xcite . in the case of travelling optical fields ,",
    "the range of available interactions is far more restricted , and generating states with interesting phase space properties is a nontrivial task from both theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "one of the states that most clearly illustrate quantum interference is a superposition of two distinct coherent states @xcite , whose generation in microwave frequency range has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "production of these states in the optical domain has been a subject of considerable theoretical interest .",
    "though several ingenious schemes have been proposed @xcite , they require extremely precise control over the dynamics of the system , which makes them very difficult to implement experimentally .",
    "in this paper we study degenerate three photon down conversion as a scheme for generating states of light that exhibit clear signatures of phase space interference .",
    "this generation scheme seems to be quite attractive , since , as we will show , it is not overly sensitive to some sources of noise . additionally , numerous experimental realizations of two photon down conversion for generating squeezed light give a solid basis for studying higher order processes , at least in principle , and developments in nonlinear optical materials suggest it may be possible to re  examine higher  order nonlinear quantum effects",
    ".    interference features of states generated in higher order down conversion have been first noted by braunstein and caves @xcite , who showed oscillations in quadrature distributions and explained them as a result of coherent overlap of two arms displayed by the @xmath0 function .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide a detailed analysis of the interference features , based on the wigner function rather than distributions of single observables .",
    "compared to the @xmath0 function , discussed previously by several authors , the wigner function carries explicit evidence of quantum coherence in the form of oscillations and negative areas .",
    "these features are not visible in the @xmath0 function , which describes inevitably noisy simultaneous measurement of the position and the momentum .    the states generated in three photon down conversion can not be described using simple analytical formulae .",
    "it is thus necessary to resort to numerical means in order to discuss their phase space properties .",
    "however we will show that the interference features can be understood with the help of simple analytical calculations .",
    "these calculations will reveal the essential role of the superposition principle in creating the interference pattern in the phase space .",
    "experimental realization of the discussed scheme along with detection of the wigner function of the generated field would be an explicit optical demonstration of totally nonclassical quantum interference in the phase space .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] , we discuss some general properties of the wigner function . in sec .",
    "[ sec : computational ] we present the numerical approach used to deal with three photon down conversion .",
    "the wigner function representing states generated in this process is studied in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : wigner ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : noise ] we discuss briefly prospects of experimental demonstration of quantum interference using the studied scheme .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] concludes the results .",
    "before we present the phase space picture of three photon down conversion , let us first discuss in general how the interference pattern is built up in the phase space by the superposition principle .",
    "our initial considerations will closely follow previous discussions of the semiclassical limit of the wigner function @xcite .",
    "they will give us later a better understanding of the interference we are concerned with in three photon down conversion , and help us to derive an analytical description of the interference pattern for this specific case .",
    "we will start by considering a wave function of the form @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a real function defining the phase and @xmath3 is a slowly varying positive envelope .",
    "the wigner function of this state is given by ( throughout this paper we put @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us first separate the contribution from the direct neighborhood of the point @xmath6 . for this purpose",
    "we will expand the phase @xmath2 up to the linear term and take the value of the envelope at the point @xmath6 , which gives @xmath7 thus , this contribution is localized around the momentum @xmath8 , and creates a concentration along the `` trajectory '' @xmath9 .",
    "this result has a straightforward interpretation in the wkb approximation of the energy eigenfunctions , where the phase @xmath2 is the classical action and its spatial derivative yields the momentum . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdelta ] ) simply states that the wigner function contains a positive component localized along the classical trajectory @xcite",
    ".    we will now study more carefully the relation between the wave function and the wigner function , taking into account contributions from other parts of the wave function , denoted symbolically by dots in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdelta ] ) . to make the discussion more general",
    ", we will take the wave function to be a superposition of finite number of components defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiaexps ] ) : @xmath10.\\ ] ] the wigner function is in this case a sum of integrals @xmath11 .",
    "\\label{eq : wsumint } & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will evaluate these integrals with the help of the stationary phase approximation . the condition for the stationary points is given by the equation @xmath12 which has a very simple geometrical intepretation .",
    "it shows that the contribution to the wigner function at the point @xmath13 comes from the points of the `` trajectories '' @xmath14 and @xmath15 satisfying @xmath16 i.e. @xmath13 is a midpoint of the line connecting the points @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these points may lie either on the same trajectory , i.e. @xmath19 or on a pair of different ones .",
    "in particular , for @xmath19 we get that @xmath20 is always a stationary point for @xmath21 , which justifies the approximation applied in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdelta ] ) . at these points the second derivative of",
    "the phase disappears .",
    "therefore we will calculate them separately , using the previous method . for the remaining pairs ,",
    "we expand the phases up to quadratic terms and perform the resulting gaussian integrals . as before , we neglect variation of the envelopes , taking their values at the stationary points .",
    "this yields an approximate form of the wigner function : @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second double sum excludes the case @xmath19 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the wigner function of the state defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psisum ] ) exhibits two main features .",
    "the first one is presence of positive humps localized along `` trajectories '' @xmath24 .",
    "any pair of points on these trajectories gives rise to the interference pattern of the wigner function at the midpoint of the line connecting this pair .",
    "let us note that the result that the interference pattern in a given area is generated by equidistant opposite pieces of the quasidistribution corresponds to the phase space picture of the superposition of two coherent states @xcite , for which the interference structure lies precisely in the center between the interfering states .",
    "numerical results presented in the following parts of the paper are obtained using a model of two quantized light modes : the signal and the pump , coupled by the interaction hamiltonian : @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the coupling constant , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the annihilation operators of the signal and pump mode , respectively .",
    "this hamiltonian is very convenient for numerical calculations , as it commutes with the operator @xmath29 , and can be diagonalized separately in each of the finite  dimensional eigenspaces of @xmath30 .",
    "details of the basic numerical approach to these kinds of hamiltonians can be found for example in refs .",
    "in contrast , the limit of a classical , undepleted pump is difficult to implement numerically due to singularities of the evolution operator on the imaginary time axis @xcite .",
    "we assume that initially the signal mode is in the vacuum state @xmath31 , and the pump is in a coherent state @xmath32 .",
    "after evolution of the system for the time @xmath33 , which we calculate in the interaction picture , we obtain the reduced density matrix of the signal field by performing the trace over the pump mode : @xmath34 describes a mixed state , as the interacting modes get entangled in the course of evolution .",
    "this density matrix is then used to calculate the wigner function and other obervables of the signal mode studied further in the paper . in the discussions ,",
    "we will make use of the analogy between a single light mode and a harmonic oscillator , assigning the names position and momentum to the quadratures @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we will restrict our studies to the regime of a strong pump and a short interaction time .",
    "this regime is the most reasonable one from experimental point of view , as strong pumping allows us to compensate for the usually weak effect of nonlinearity , and the short interaction time gives us a chance to ignore or to suppress dissipation .",
    "we can gain some intuition about the dynamics of the system by considering the classical case ; this is done in appendix  [ app : classical ] .",
    "the most important conclusion is that in the classical picture the origin of the phase space is an unstable fixed point , with three symmetric directions of growth , in a star  like formation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : wignerfunction ] we depict the wigner function representing the state of the signal field generated for the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this state is almost pure , as @xmath39 = 0.92 $ ] indicates little entanglement between the pump and the down  converted mode .",
    "the three developing arms follow the classical directions of growth from the unstable origin of the phase space .",
    "the coherence between these components results in an interference pattern filling the regions between the arms , consisting of positive and negative strips .",
    "thus , the wigner function is `` forced '' by the superposition principle to take negative values in order to manifest the quantum coherence of the state .",
    "let us now study in more detail how the interference pattern is generated by coherent superposition of distinct phase space components .",
    "we will focus our attention on the three arms displayed by the quasidistribution , neglecting the bulk of positive probability at the origin of the phase space remaining from the initial vacuum `` source '' state . as the purity factor of the generated state is close to one",
    ", we will base our calculations on pure states .",
    "the relation between the wave function and the wigner function derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] suggests that the arms can be modelled by three components of the wave function : @xmath40 with slowly varying envelopes and the position ",
    "dependent phase factors : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the interference pattern observed in the phase space is a result of the coherent superposition of these three components .",
    "however , in order to calculate quantitatively the structure of the interference pattern , we need to know the relative phase factors between the wave functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi0psi1psi2 ] ) .",
    "we will obtain these factors with the help of the additional information that the hamiltonian defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ourhamiltonian ] ) excites or annihilates triplets of signal photons .",
    "consequently , the photon distribution of the generated state is nonzero only for fock states being multiples of three , as the initial state was the vacuum .",
    "using this fact , we can define an operator which performs a rotation in phase space by an angle @xmath44 : @xmath45 and impose the relations @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this choice for the phase of the operator @xmath48 ensures that the superposition defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi0psi1psi2 ] ) has the necessary property to generate the correct triplet photon statistics .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath49 is given by a slowly varying positive function @xmath3 , localized for @xmath50 .",
    "we will not consider any specific form of the envelope @xmath3 , as the main purpose of this model is to predict the position and shape of the interference fringes .",
    "the other two wave functions can be calculated with the help of the formula derived in appendix  [ app : rotating ] , which finally yields : @xmath51    given this result , we can use the approximate form of the wigner function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wapprox ] ) to model the numerically calculated wigner function .",
    "some problems arise from the fact that the three components are localized along straight lines . in this case",
    "the stationary phase approximation fails to work for points belonging to the same arm , and the wigner function of each component depends substantially on the envelope",
    ". therefore we will denote them as @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 without specifying their detailed form .",
    "nevertheless , the stationary phase approximation can be safely used to calculate the interference pattern between the arms , where the contributing points belong to two distinct arms .",
    "thus we represent the model wigner function as a sum of four components @xmath55 where the interference term @xmath56 is given by    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    @xmath57{}\\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{r}{|p| < -q } \\\\ \\displaystyle { \\cal a}\\left(2q + \\frac{2p}{\\sqrt{3 } } \\right ) { \\cal a}\\left(\\frac{4p}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right ) \\cos\\left(\\frac{2p^2}{\\sqrt{3 } } + 2qp - \\frac{\\pi}{12 }",

    "\\multicolumn{1}{r}{p < \\min\\{\\sqrt{3}q,0\\ } } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    2 as the envelope @xmath3 is a positive function , the oscillations of the interference pattern are determined by the argument of the cosine function .",
    "the lines of constant argument are hyperbolas with asymptotics @xmath58 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wignerfunction](b ) we superpose the pattern generated by the interference term of the model wigner function on top of the numerically calculated quasidistribution ; the agreement between the two is excellent .",
    "thus , our model effectively describes the form of the interference pattern and predicts negative areas of the wigner function .",
    "let us emphasize that this analytical model is based exclusively on two considerations : the position of the interfering components in the phase space , and the phase relations between them , which were derived from our study of the triplet photon statistics for this problem .",
    "this shows that the interference pattern is very `` stiff '' , i.e.  these two considerations strictly impose its specific form .",
    "consequently , the interference pattern does not change substantially as long as the crucial features of the state remain fixed .",
    "in particular , the interaction time and the pump amplitude have only a slight influence on the basic form of the interference pattern , as they determine only the amount of probability density transferred to the arms of the quasidistribution .",
    "we will now briefly review the consequences of these phase  space interference effects and the prospects for experimental demonstration of quantum interference using three photon down conversion .",
    "first , let us discuss signatures of quantum coherence that can be directly observed in the experimental data .",
    "an experimentally established technique for measuring the wigner function of a light mode is optical homodyne tomography @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the wigner function is reconstructed from distributions of the quadrature operator @xmath59 , measured with the help of a balanced homodyne detector .",
    "these distributions are projections of the wigner function on the axis defined by the equation @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadratures ] we plot the quadrature distributions for the phase @xmath44 in the range @xmath61 . due to the symmetry of the wigner function , other distributions",
    "have the same form , up to the transformation @xmath62 .",
    "the fringes appearing for @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadratures ] are a clear signature of quantum coherence between the two arms of the quasidistribution that are projected onto the same half  axis .",
    "we can describe the position of the fringes using the model three  component wave function derived in eq .",
    "( [ eq : threecomponents ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider only the phase @xmath64 , for which the fringes have the best visibility due to equal contributions from both the arms .",
    "the model quadrature distribution in the half ",
    "axis @xmath63 is given by @xmath65 analysis of this expression reveals some interesting analogies . expanding the argument of the cosine function around a point @xmath66 yields that the `` local '' spacing between the consecutive fringes is @xmath67 .",
    "the same result can be obtained by considering a superposition of two coherent states centered at the points @xmath68 and @xmath69 , i.e. , where the contributing pieces of the arms are localized .",
    "furthermore , the argument of the cosine function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modelquadrature ] ) is equal , up to an additive constant , to half of the area caught between the two arms of the generated state , and the wigner function of the position eigenstate representing the measurement .",
    "thus , the quadrature distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modelquadrature ] ) illustrates schleich and wheeler s phase space rules for calculating quantum transition probabilities @xcite .",
    "let us now estimate the effect of dissipation and nonunit detector efficiency on the interference pattern exhibited by the wigner function .",
    "for this purpose we will calculate evolution of the generated state under the master equation : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the damping parameter .",
    "evolution over the interval @xmath72 yields the state that is effectively measured in a homodyne setup with imperfect detectors characterized by the quantum efficiency @xmath73 . in phase space ,",
    "the effect of dissipation is represented by coarsening of the wigner function by convolution with a gaussian function @xcite : @xmath74 this coarsening smears out entirely the very fine details of the wigner function , whose characteristic length is smaller than @xmath75 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dissipation ] we plot the wigner function along the position axis as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "the interference pattern disappears faster in the area more distant from the origin of the phase space , where the frequency of the oscillations is larger .",
    "nevertheless , the first negative dip , which is the widest one , can still be noticed even for @xmath77 .",
    "current technology gives some optimistic figures about the possibility of detecting the interference pattern , as virtually 100% efficient photodetectors are available in the range of light intensities measured ( in a different context , that of squeezed light ) in a homodyne scheme @xcite .",
    "however , there are also other mechanisms of losses , such as absorption during nonlinear interaction and nonunit overlap of the homodyned modes , whose importance can not be estimated without reference to a specific experimental setup .",
    "an analysis of these would be out of place here .",
    "let us finally consider the impact of pump fluctuations on the interference pattern .",
    "we illustrate the discussion with fig .",
    "[ fig : pumpnoise ] , depicting the state generated using a noisy pump field modelled by a gaussian @xmath78representation @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the average field amplitude and @xmath81 is the number of thermal photons . in discussing the effect of noise , we have to distinguish between phase and amplitude fluctuations .",
    "phase fluctuations have a quite deleterious effect , as a change in the pump phase by @xmath82 is equivalent to the rotation of the signal phase space by @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , phase fluctuations average the signal wigner function over a certain phase range .",
    "the fringes are most fragile near the arms due to neighboring bulk of positive probability .",
    "the interference pattern in the areas between the arms varies slowly with phase , which makes it more robust .",
    "these properties are clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : pumpnoise ] .",
    "the effect of amplitude fluctuations is not crucial , as the position of the fringes does not depend substantially on the pump amplitude .",
    "we have demonstrated that degenerate three photon down conversion generates nonclassical states of light , whose wigner function exhibits nontrivial interference pattern due to coherent superposition of distinct phase space components .",
    "we have developed an analytical description of this pattern , which precisely predicts its form .",
    "let us note that the rich phase space picture of higher order down conversion contrasts with the two photon case , where the only signature of quantum coherence is suppression of quadrature dispersion @xcite .",
    "discussion of the impact of dissipation and pump fluctuations on the coherence properties of the generated state shows that the interference pattern can partly be observed even in the presence of moderate amount of noise .",
    "an important element of the studied scheme is that the signal state is generated using a strong external pump , which enhances the usually weak effect of @xmath84 nonlinearity .",
    "this allows us the optimism to expect that three photon down conversion is perhaps more feasible than schemes based on nonlinear self  interaction of the signal field .",
    "the analytical method developed in this paper to describe the phase space interference pattern can be applied to other cases , where the quasidistribution is a coherent superposition of well localized components , for example superpositions of two squeezed states @xcite , and squeezed coherent states for the su(1,1 ) group @xcite .",

    "we wish to acknowledge useful discussions with i. jex , m. hillery , v. buek , and k. wdkiewicz .",

    "the change in the pump phase is equivalent to the rotation of the signal phase space , we can assume with no loss of generality that the pump amplitude @xmath85 is a real positive number .",
    "we will now decompose the complex signal field amplitude into its modulus @xmath86 and the phase @xmath44 .",
    "the classical hamiltonian in this parametrization reads @xmath87 and the resulting equations of motion are @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the rescaled time . as the energy of the system",
    "is conserved , trajectories of the system are defined by the equation @xmath90 .",
