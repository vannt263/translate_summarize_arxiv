    "a _ circle packing _ in @xmath0 is defined to be a finite collection of pairwise interiorwise disjoint metric closed disks in the riemann sphere @xmath7 equipped with the constant curvature @xmath8 metric as usual .",
    "there are no conditions on the radii of the disks .",
    "we say that two closed disks are _ tangent _ if their boundary circles are tangent .",
    "the _ contact graph _ of a circle packing @xmath9 is the graph @xmath10 whose vertex set is in bijection with the disks of @xmath9 , so that two vertices share an edge if and only if the corresponding disks are tangent .",
    "recall that a graph is called _ planar _ if it can be homeomorphically embedded in the plane .",
    "the contact graph @xmath10 of a circle packing in @xmath0 is always planar , because we may draw the vertices of @xmath10 at the metric centers of the disks they correspond to , and connect adjacent vertices with geodesic arcs .",
    "it turns out that conversely , any planar graph @xmath10 can be realized by a circle packing @xmath9 in @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath10 is the 1-skeleton of a triangulation of the 2-sphere @xmath11 , then this @xmath9 unique , up to action by mbius and anti - mbius transformations on @xmath0 .",
    "these results together constitute what is probably the most important theorem in circle packing , known as the koebe @xcite ",
    "andreev @xcite  thurston theorem . a major motivating factor for the study of circle packings",
    "is that they are , in a certain precise sense , a discrete approximation to the riemann mapping , as originally conjectured by thurston and proved by rodin and sullivan in @xcite .",
    "the close relationship between circle packing and e.g.  classical complex analysis has been further confirmed many times , for example see @xcite . for further exposition and references on circle packing ,",
    "see for example the articles and their bibliographies , or the book @xcite by stephenson .",
    "in this article we present some tools for uniformizing circle packings to make the centers and radii of their disks algebraic .",
    "precisely , a circle packing @xmath9 in @xmath0 is called _ algebraic _ if the following are all algebraic :    * all tangency points between pairs of disks in @xmath9 , * all centers of disks in @xmath9 , and * all euclidean radii of disks in @xmath9 under stereographic projection .",
    "there are two equivalent definitions of algebraicity of a point @xmath12 .",
    "first , we may say that @xmath13 is algebraic if and only if either the image of @xmath14 under standard stereographic projection to @xmath1 is algebraic , or @xmath15 .",
    "second , we may say that @xmath16 is algebraic if and only if @xmath17 .",
    "the first main theorem of this article is :    [ main1 ] [ every g admits an algebraic packing ] let @xmath10 be a finite , simple , planar graph .",
    "then there exists an algebraic circle packing in @xmath0 having contact graph @xmath10 .",
    "recall that a graph is called _ simple _ if it is undirected , does not have loops , and has no repeated edges .",
    "a _ loop _ is an edge from a vertex to itself . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "theorem [ every g admits an algebraic packing ] has never appeared in print .",
    "next , we consider circle packings on more general riemann surfaces .",
    "a _ circle packing _ on a riemann surface @xmath2 is a collection of pairwise interiorwise disjoint metric closed disks on @xmath2 .",
    "the following is well - known , see @xcite :    [ dut ] let @xmath18 be a triangulation of a compact oriented topological surface without boundary",
    ". then there exists a constant curvature closed riemann surface @xmath2 homeomorphic to @xmath18 , and a locally finite circle packing @xmath9 on @xmath2 , so that @xmath9 realizes @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore @xmath2 is uniquely determined by @xmath18 up to action by conformal isomorphisms on @xmath2 , and @xmath9 is then uniquely determined by @xmath18 and @xmath2 up to action by conformal and anti - conformal automorphisms of @xmath2 .",
    "a _ triangulation_[triangulations ] @xmath19 of a surface @xmath20 is a collection of triangular faces @xmath21 , having vertices @xmath22 and edges @xmath23 , with identifications along the edges so that the resulting object is homeomorphic to @xmath20 .",
    "we require that two distinct faces of @xmath18 meet along a single edge , or at a single vertex , or not at all , and that there are no vertex nor edge identifications along the boundary of any one triangle .",
    "then the 1-skeleton of @xmath18 is the graph @xmath24 .",
    "we consider triangulations only up to their combinatorics .",
    "we say that the circle packing @xmath9 _ realizes _",
    "@xmath18 if the contact graph of @xmath9 is equal to the 1-skeleton of @xmath18 .    call a riemann surface @xmath2 which comes from some triangulation @xmath18 via theorem [ dut ] _",
    "circle packable_. in other words , we say that @xmath2 is _ circle packable _ if there exists a locally finite circle packing @xmath9 on @xmath2 realizing some triangulation of @xmath2 .",
    "then theorem [ dut ] implies that there are many @xmath2 which fail to be circle packable : this is because for any @xmath25 the moduli space of genus @xmath26 riemann surfaces is uncountable , but there are only countably many triangulations , considered up to combinatorial equivalence , of a genus @xmath26 surface .",
    "it is then natural to ask which compact riemann surfaces are circle packable .    in @xcite , brooks proves that the circle packable compact riemann surfaces @xmath2 of given genus are dense in their moduli space .",
    "the next two theorems we state here , originally due to @xcite*chapters 8 , 9 , give further information in the direction of an answer to this question :    [ main2 ] [ circle packable tori have algebraic modulus ] suppose that @xmath27 is a flat circle packable torus .",
    "then @xmath27 is similar or isometric to @xmath28 , with @xmath29 some algebraic number in the upper half - plane .    in other words ,",
    "any flat circle packable torus has algebraic modulus .",
    "we also show that if @xmath9 is a circle packing in @xmath28 with @xmath29 in the upper half - plane , then the disks of @xmath9 have algebraic radii , and furthermore @xmath9 may be chosen so that all of its disks centers and tangency points lift to algebraic numbers in @xmath1 .",
    "next :    [ main3 ] [ circle packable compact surfaces are algebraic ] suppose that @xmath2 is a compact circle packable riemann surface without boundary of genus at least 2 , and of constant curvature @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath2 is isometric to the quotient of @xmath4 by a subgroup of @xmath30 .",
    "here @xmath4 denotes the hyperbolic plane , and @xmath31 the group of orientation - preserving isometries of @xmath4 .",
    "we also show that then we may take the ( hyperbolic ) centers of the circles to be algebraic , and also that each circle has a hyperbolic radius which is the logarithm of an algebraic number .    beyond these results , and",
    "the denseness theorem mentioned above , not much is known about which compact riemann surfaces are circle packable .",
    "the analogous question in the open surface case has been answered completely by williams in @xcite , where he proves that every open complete constant curvature riemann surface @xmath2 admits a locally finite circle packing having contact graph triangulating @xmath2 .",
    "more recently , kojima , mizushima , tan , and others have studied the closely related question of which projective structures on surfaces are packable .",
    "an excellent recent survey of results and open problems in that area is @xcite .",
    "another closely related question is the following : if @xmath32 is a complete orientable finite - volume non - compact hyperbolic 3-manifold , then each of its cusps is isometric to @xmath33 , where @xmath27 is some flat torus",
    ". then one may ask which flat tori appear in this way .",
    "it is known that only countably many do . in @xcite ,",
    "nimershiem proves that every circle packable flat torus arises as the cusp of some @xmath32 as above , and gives an explicit construction .",
    "we now move on to our methods of proof for theorems [ main1 ] , [ main2 ] , [ main3 ] .",
    "we have three different methods .",
    "each of the next three sections of this article addresses a different one of these three methods of proof .",
    "each approach works to prove a subset of theorems [ main1 ] , [ main2 ] , [ main3 ] , but none seems to work to prove all three . in each case , we include a discussion of the obstructions to applying a given method to those of our three main theorems which it does not handle .",
    "the first method , which will prove theorems [ main1 ] and [ main2 ] , is via a result from model theory :    [ tarski ] suppose that @xmath20 is a first - order sentence in the theory of real - closed fields . if @xmath20 is true in one real - closed field , then it is true in every real - closed field .",
    "a _ real - closed field _ is an ordered field @xmath21 , so that any positive element of @xmath21 has a square root in @xmath21 , and so that any odd - degree polynomial over @xmath21 has a root in @xmath21 .",
    "the only two examples we care about here are the real numbers @xmath34 and the real algebraic numbers @xmath35 .",
    "first - order sentence in the theory of real - closed fields _ is , roughly speaking , a finite logical statement , in which we may use the usual logical connectives and quantifiers ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) , as well as the symbols from the theory of real - closed fields ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) , so that all variables in the statement are appropriately quantified .",
    "our plan is to translate the statements of theorems [ main1 ] and [ main2 ] into appropriately constructed first - order sentences which we know to be true over @xmath34 by other means , and then to apply tarski s theorem [ tarski ] to obtain the truth of these sentences over @xmath35 .",
    "theorem [ main1 ] follows almost immediately , but the situation for theorem [ main2 ] is more subtle .",
    "this proof technique is covered in detail in section [ tarski s section ] .",
    "swan provides a nice expository article on tarski s theorem [ tarski ] , including a proof , in @xcite , and cites the book @xcite of kreisel and krivine as his source .",
    "the proof of tarski s theorem is by elimination of quantifiers .",
    "our second technique works only to prove theorem [ main1 ] .",
    "it proceeds via the following algebraicity result of thurston in the flavor of the mostow ",
    "prasad rigidity theorem , found in @xcite*proposition 6.7.4 :    [ thurston algebraicity prop ] if @xmath49 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath50 such that @xmath51 has finite volume , then @xmath49 is conjugate to a group of matrices whose entries are algebraic .",
    "we sketch a proof of proposition [ thurston algebraicity prop ] at the end of section [ thurston s section ] .",
    "our proof of theorem [ main1 ] proceeds as follows .",
    "we first complete our finite simple planar graph @xmath10 to the 1-skeleton of a triangulation @xmath18 , and circle pack the resulting triangulation in @xmath0 by the koebe ",
    "thurston theorem , denoting the resulting packing by @xmath9 .",
    "then every connected component @xmath52 of @xmath53 is a curvilinear triangle .",
    "for such a @xmath52 , let @xmath54 be the metric closed disk in @xmath0 containing @xmath52 , whose boundary circle passes through the corners of @xmath52 .",
    "then the collection @xmath55 of all such @xmath54 is called the _ dual circle packing _ to @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath56 be the group generated by reflections in the boundary circles of the disks of @xmath9 and @xmath57 .",
    "we argue that @xmath56 is a discrete , finite covolume subgroup of @xmath58 .",
    "it follows that the group @xmath49 consisting of orientation - preserving elements of @xmath56 is also discrete and of finite covolume",
    ". then proposition [ thurston algebraicity prop ] allows us to assume without loss of generality that @xmath59 .",
    "it follows easily that the tangency points of pairs of disks in @xmath9 are algebraic .",
    "we obtain the algebraic circle packing whose contact graph is our original graph @xmath10 as a sub - packing of @xmath9 , establishing theorem [ main1 ] .",
    "we work out the details of this technique in section [ thurston s section ] .",
    "the approaches via tarski s theorem [ tarski ] or proposition [ thurston algebraicity prop ] had not previously been used to prove algebraicity statements for circle packings .",
    "the third and final technique we exposit is due to mccaughan , and was applied in his ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite*chapters 8 , 9 to prove theorems [ main2 ] and [ main3 ] .",
    "although it was not noted by mccaughan , this approach also works to prove theorem [ main1 ] .",
    "the main tool is the following lemma of real algebraic geometry :    [ mccaughan ] let @xmath60 be a real algebraic variety defined over a field @xmath61 , in @xmath62 variables , and let @xmath63 be a point of @xmath60 which is isolated if we give @xmath60 the subspace topology from @xmath64 .",
    "then the coordinates of @xmath63 are algberaic over @xmath65 .",
    "then the idea is to express the existence of a suitably normalized circle packing in the complex or hyperbolic plane by a set of algebraic equations defining a variety .",
    "one shows that this variety is non - empty and that the point of the variety corresponding to the circle packing is appropriately isolated , and then applies the lemma .",
    "we work out the details of this approach , and also sketch a proof of lemma [ mccaughan ] , in section [ mccaughan s section ] .",
    "* acknowledgements .",
    "* we thank ralf spatzier for pointing us indirectly to thurston s proposition [ thurston algebraicity prop ] .",
    "thanks to chris hall for referring us to tarski s theorem [ tarski ] .",
    "thanks to sergiy merenkov for referring us to mccaughan s thesis @xcite .",
    "thanks to andreas blass , dan hathaway , and scott schneider for helpful background references on logic and model theory .",
    "[ tarski section ]    we begin the section with some terminology from model theory , and then go on to prove theorems [ main1 ] and [ main2 ] using tarski s theorem [ tarski ] . at the end of the section we describe the main difficulty of applying this technique to prove theorem [ main3 ] .",
    "we first give the precise definition of _ elementary statement _ , to go with the statement of tarski s theorem [ tarski ] .",
    "first , an _ atomic predicate in the theory of real - closed fields _ is defined to be a relation of the form @xmath66 or @xmath67 , where @xmath26 is a polynomial with integer coefficients in the variables @xmath68 .",
    "we fix once and for all a countable collection of free variables which we may use in our atomic predicates .",
    "the collection of _ elementary predicates in the theory of real - closed fields _ is defined to be the smallest collection    * containing all of the atomic predicates , * closed under negation @xmath38 , disjunction @xmath39 , and conjunction @xmath40 , * closed under existential quantification @xmath69 , and * closed under universal quantification @xmath70 .",
    "in particular , elementary predicates are finitely long .",
    "finally , an _ elementary statement in the theory of real - closed fields _ is an elementary predicate in that theory having no free variables , that is , all of whose variables have been appropriately quantified .",
    "tarski s theorem [ tarski ] says that one can not distinguish between different real - closed fields using only elementary statements .",
    "we consider a simpler example : an _ elementary statement in the theory of groups _ is defined in the analogous way , but the atomic predicates are just relations of the form @xmath71 .",
    "we _ can _ distinguish between different groups in this restricted language : for example , the statement @xmath72 is true in @xmath73 , but is false in @xmath74 .",
    "tarski s theorem says that this does not happen in the theory of real - closed fields . for a more thorough exposition on these definitions and on tarski s theorem ,",
    "see @xcite*section 2 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a finite simple planar graph .",
    "the existence of a circle packing having contact graph @xmath10 may be expressed as follows .",
    "enumerate the vertices of @xmath22 by @xmath75 . for",
    "every vertex @xmath76 of @xmath22 , let @xmath77 be free variables , which will naturally represent the @xmath78-coordinate , @xmath79-coordinate , and euclidean radius , of the disk corresponding to @xmath76 .",
    "* for @xmath80 , let @xmath81 be the atomic predicate @xmath82 .",
    "these statement will ensure that the radii of our disks are positive . * enumerate the edges @xmath83 of @xmath10 . for every @xmath84 ,",
    "let @xmath85 be the atomic predicate @xmath86 .",

    "suppose there are @xmath90 such pairs .",
    "for every such pair , let @xmath91 , with @xmath92 , be the atomic predicate @xmath93 .",
    "this statement will ensure that the disks corresponding to @xmath87 and @xmath88 do not meet .",
    "* then , let @xmath20 be the elementary statement : @xmath94    then the truth of @xmath20 if the existential symbol is taken to quantify over @xmath34 is equivalent to the existence of a circle packing in @xmath1 having contact graph @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore @xmath20 is true when quantified over @xmath34 , by the koebe ",
    "thurston theorem , as we discussed before .",
    "thus by tarski s theorem [ tarski ] , the statement @xmath20 is also true when quantified over @xmath35 .",
    "theorem [ main1 ] follows immediately .",
    "our approach is along the same lines as in the proof of theorem [ main1 ] , but there are added difficulties .",
    "we begin by pointing out the complications , and outlining our plan .",
    "let @xmath18 be a triangulation of a topological 2-torus .",
    "note first that the existence of a circle packing on some flat torus @xmath27 realizing @xmath18 is equivalent to the existence of a doubly translation - periodic circle packing in the universal cover @xmath1 of @xmath27 , realizing the lift of the triangulation @xmath18 .",
    "thus we wish to express , via an elementary statement in the theory of real - closed fields , the existence of a @xmath29 in the upper half - plane , and a @xmath95-periodic circle packing @xmath96 in @xmath1 , so that the image of @xmath97 in the quotient @xmath98 is a circle packing @xmath9 in the torus @xmath27 having contact graph equal to the 1-skeleton of @xmath18 .",
    "however , our elementary statement can not have an infinite number of constituent atomic predicates , so we can not simply pick @xmath77 for every vertex of the infinite packing @xmath97 and quantify over them . instead",
    ", our plan is to pick a sort of `` fundamental domain '' for @xmath97 , having only finitely many disks , so that the image of these disks under the action by @xmath95 is all of @xmath97 .",
    "we now work out the proof in detail . beginning with the triangulation @xmath18 , let @xmath27 be a flat torus , and let @xmath9 be the circle packing in @xmath27 having contact graph equal to the 1-skeleton of @xmath18 , by the discrete uniformization theorem [ dut ] .",
    "let @xmath97 be its lift to @xmath1 .",
    "we now apply some normalizations to @xmath97 .",
    "first , note that for example @xmath95 and @xmath99 act the same way on @xmath1 , so the choice of @xmath29 in the generators of the group which quotients @xmath97 to @xmath9 is not unique .",
    "however , it is well - known ( see @xcite*section 7.2.3 , theorem 2 ) that every flat torus is equivalent ( by a similarity ) to exactly one @xmath100 for @xmath29 in the so - called _ fundamental region of the modular group _ , which we will denote by @xmath22 .",
    "specifically , letting @xmath101 denote the upper half - plane , we have : @xmath102 normalize @xmath97 by euclidean similarities so that @xmath103 for some @xmath104 . by the essential uniqueness of @xmath2 in the discrete uniformization theorem [ dut ] , we have precisely one choice of @xmath105 for this normalization .    next ,",
    "pick once and for all a distinguished vertex @xmath106 of @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath107 denote the disk of @xmath9 corresponding to @xmath106 .",
    "apply translations to @xmath97 so that some lift @xmath108 of @xmath109 is centered at the origin .",
    "then in particular the lifts of @xmath107 in @xmath97 are exactly the images of @xmath108 under the action by @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , by the essential uniqueness of @xmath9 in the discrete uniformization theorem [ dut ] , the resulting packing @xmath97 is the unique one which is @xmath95-periodic , so that there is a lift of @xmath107 centered at the origin .",
    "( actually , the last sentence is only true if @xmath28 has no non - trivial automorphisms .",
    "if @xmath28 has non - trivial automorphisms then we will require one more normalizing condition to identify @xmath97 uniquely , but almost any reasonably chosen one will do , and it will be clear how to adapt the rest of our argument to include the extra normalization .",

    "* we include the open bottom and left sides , but neither the top nor the right side of the parallelogram @xmath110 .    explicitly ,",
    "if @xmath111 for @xmath112 , then we may express @xmath110 as : @xmath113 this expression will be helpful later .",

    "<S> the main purpose of this article is to demonstrate three techniques for proving algebraicity statements about circle packings . </S>",
    "<S> we give proofs of three related theorems : ( 1 ) that every finite simple planar graph is the contact graph of a circle packing on @xmath0 , equivalently in @xmath1 , all of whose tangency points , centers , and radii are algebraic , ( 2 ) that every flat conformal torus which admits a circle packing whose contact graph triangulates the torus has algebraic modulus , and ( 3 ) that if @xmath2 is a compact riemann surface of genus at least 2 , having constant curvature @xmath3 , which admits a circle packing whose contact graph triangulates @xmath2 , then @xmath2 is isomorphic to the quotient of @xmath4 by a subgroup of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the statement ( 1 ) is original , while ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) have been previously proved in @xcite*chapters 8 , 9 the ph.d .  </S>",
    "<S> thesis of mccaughan .    </S>",
    "<S> our first proof technique is to apply tarski s theorem , a result from model theory , which says that if an elementary statement in the theory of real - closed fields is true over one real - closed field , then it is true over any real closed field . </S>",
    "<S> this technique works to prove ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our second proof technique is via an algebraicity result of thurston on finite co - volume discrete subgroups of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this technique works to prove ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our first and second techniques had not previously been applied in this area . </S>",
    "<S> our third and final technique is via a lemma in real algebraic geometry , and was previously used by mccaughan to prove ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in fact it may be used to prove ( 1 ) as well . </S>"
