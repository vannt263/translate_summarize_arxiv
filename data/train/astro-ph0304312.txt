    "bearings are often considered one of the major uses of bulk high - temperature superconductor ( hts ) , and considerable development effort of such bearings has occurred since the discovery of hts @xcite .",
    "hts bearings are characterized by very low drag torque .",
    "this , together with stiffness and damping against perturbations from equilibrium have led to investigations of their use in flywheel energy systems @xcite-@xcite , a lunar telescope @xcite , sensitive gravimeters @xcite , and as a sensitive detector of gas pressure @xcite . here",
    "we present a design for a cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation polarimeter that is based on levitating a rotating half wave plate by means of an hts bearing .",
    "there is intense scientific and popular interest in uncovering the physical conditions in the universe at epochs as close as possible to the big bang .",
    "tremendous progress in this endeavor has been achieved already through detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "the cmb permeates the entire universe and has a black body spectrum with an equivalent temperature of 2.73 k @xcite .",
    "information about the _ spatial anisotropy _ in the intensity of the cmb , as measured by a number of recent experiments @xcite-@xcite has revealed that the universe is topologically flat @xcite-@xcite and has lent strong support to the idea that the universe has undergone a period of exponential growth , an inflation , at about @xmath1 seconds after the bang @xcite . by combining the data from cmb and other astrophysical measurements",
    "we can now determine that only 5% of the matter and energy density in the universe is made of ordinary electrons , quarks , neutrinos and photons , and that the rest is split into @xmath2 vacuum energy and @xmath3 a new form of dark matter. aside from their existence , very little is known about either the vacuum energy or the dark matter .",
    "cmb measurements have also helped to constrain the age of the universe to within about 10% accuracy and to construct a reliable scenario for its evolution .",
    "the _ polarization _ of the cmb radiation field encodes new and valuable information about the early universe and an intense research effort has begun to discover and characterize the polarization signal .",
    "detection of the polarization signal will enhance our confidence in the prevailing cosmological model and will provide more information about the properties of the constituents of the universe @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the polarization signal seems to be the only direct probe of the inflationary epoch close to the big bang @xcite .",
    "a detection of such a signal will provide strong supporting evidence for the concept of inflation and will illuminate the physical processes involved .",
    "the polarization anisotropy of the cmb is expected to have two components , the scalar and tensor components @xcite .",
    "the scalar component should have a magnitude of about a few , about a factor of 10 smaller than the 50  rms temperature anisotropy .",
    "the tensor component , which has its origin in the inflationary epoch , is smaller by _ at least _ a factor of 100 compared to the temperature anisotropy .",
    "cmb receivers are just now reaching the sensitivity required to detect the scalar component .",
    "a high signal - to - noise ratio detection of the cmb polarization will require a combination of high sensitivity and strong rejection of systematic errors .",
    "an experimental approach that satisfies both of these requirements is to use bolometric detectors at the focal plane of an optical system that modulates the incoming polarization signal .",
    "bolometers are the most sensitive detectors at the frequency range where the cmb is most intense @xcite .",
    "temporal modulation of the incoming signal and subsequent lock - in is a standard and powerful technique to separate small signals from noise .",
    "it is also an effective technique to reject systematic errors that appear at a frequency different from the signal modulation frequency .",
    "the best technique currently available for modulating the polarization of the incident radiation is by turning a half wave plate ( hwp ) .",
    "when a hwp is placed in the path of the incident light and turned at a rotation frequency @xmath4 , the polarization vector of the output radiation rotates at a frequency of @xmath5 .",
    "the radiation is then passed through a polarization analyzer , for example a fixed polarizing grid , and is then detected .",
    "the signal recorded by the detector is modulated at a frequency of @xmath5 and standard lock - in techniques can be used to extract its magnitude .",
    "although a rotating hwp has been used with many experiments , over a broad range of wavelengths @xcite-@xcite the challenge in adapting the technique to cmb polarimetry is coupling the rotation mechanism to bolometric detectors which have high sensitivity to microphonic noise .",
    "standard mechanical rotation mechanisms , such as gears and bearings , have stick - slip friction which induce vibrations . the vibrations deposit mechanical energy in the detectors and cause wires to vibrate thereby inducing excess noise .",
    "we have developed a magnetic bearing for use with polarization experiments that is based on magnetic levitation of a hwp above a high temperature superconductive ( hts ) material .",
    "the apparatus is designed to fit in a balloon borne bolometric experiment maxipol that will attempt to detect the scalar component of the cmb polarization @xcite .",
    "the mechanism can be easily adapted to any polarization experiment and particularly for a future nasa satellite mission dedicated for detailed mapping of the tensor component of the cmb polarization .",
    "we describe the hardware in section  [ sec : hardware ] , report on initial tests in section  [ sec : results ] and summarize in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "maxipol consists of an array of 16 bolometric photometers coupled to a 3 mirror off - axis gregorian telescope , see fig .  [",
    "fig : maxima_system ] .",
    "the experiment is optimized for stratospheric balloon borne ( @xmath6 km ) observations of the cmb .",
    "the high altitude significantly reduces photon noise and noise due to atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "the bolometers are maintained at a temperature of 0.1 k by means of an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator @xcite .",
    "the optical system consists of a 1.3 meter primary mirror and two additional mirrors that are maintained at liquid helium temperature .",
    "adapting a magnetic bearing system for a cryogenic balloon borne experiment poses a number of requirements on the particular implementation .    *",
    "the hwp must be cooled to liquid he temperatures to reduce the optical load on the detectors . *",
    "the hwp must be located at the aperture stop of the optical system to eliminate a potential source of systematic error . *",
    "characteristic rotation frequencies are @xmath7 hz , limited by the @xmath8 msec response time of the bolometric detectors .",
    "* it should be possible to accelerate the rotor periodically with minimal friction or electro - magnetic interference . *",
    "the bearing system needs to be locked during periods of very strong accelerations , for example during launch or flight termination , and then released to begin operations .",
    "the latching mechanism needs to be remote - controlled .",
    "* the bearing system stiffness must be sufficiently high to operate through a range of tilt angles .",
    "damping should be high to dampen oscillations that may occur during typical observing conditions . *",
    "all bearing properties must be stable over long periods of time .",
    "the hwp and its rotation mechanism are located at the aperture stop of the optical system , which is between the tertiary mirror and the focal surface of the system , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hts_hwp ] .",
    "a polarizing wire grid mounted at the entrance to the photometers transmits only one component of the incident polarization vector .",
    "the hwp consists of a 3.2 mm thick z - cut sapphire disk with a radius of 2.54 cm which is mounted inside a permanent ring - shaped magnet .",
    "the magnet and the hwp are the rotor of a magnetic bearing that is levitated above a ring of ybco hts material .",
    "the sintered ndfeb magnet has an inside radius of 2.54 cm , an outside radius of 3.56 cm , thickness of 1.2 cm , and mass of 0.2 kg .",
    "it is polarized in the axial direction and has a remnance of @xmath9 gauss and an energy product of @xmath10 gauss - oersted .",
    "the moments of inertia of the hwp and magnet are 83 and 1910 gr@xmath11@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "a hwp holder , made of delrin and with a gear at its outer circumference , holds the magnet / hwp combination together and is part of the rotor , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mbearing ] .",
    "the magnet is held at an appropriate distance @xmath13 above a ring of hts material which consists of 12 pieces of melt - textured ybco @xcite .",
    "the distance @xmath13 is a free parameter and is typically between 4 to 10 mm .",
    "two clamps , each resembling a plier , hold the rotor in place during the cool - down of the system . a cryogenic stepping motor that drives a shaft and a pair of cams",
    "is used to open and close the clamps .",
    "the hts material and the clamps are mounted on a g-10 board .",
    "rotation of the rotor is achieved by means of a half gear that is driven by a second stepping motor that is mounted outside of the cryostat . during cool - down the half gear and the gear at the outer circumference of the rotor",
    "are engaged .",
    "once the system has cooled to 4 k , the clamps are opened and the half gear is turned with a pre - programmed acceleration .    if the need arises to re - rotate the rotor , the half - gear can be stepped slowly until it engages with the rotor , and the process repeats .",
    "the axial spring constant at 77 k was measured to be 256 and 136 n / m for levitation distances of 8.6 and 10.7 mm , respectively .",
    "the corresponding resonant frequencies are about 5.5 and 4 hz , respectively .",
    "we tested all the mechanical components of the hts bearing at liquid nitrogen , liquid helium and intermediate temperatures .",
    "we carried out spin - down measurements between @xmath14 and @xmath15 hz to determine the coefficient of friction of the bearing at various temperatures , levitation heights , ambient pressures , and as a function of the magnetic field structure of the magnet .",
    "measurements between 4.2 and 77 k were conducted in a liquid he cryostat ( lhc ) in which the stator was mounted on a 0.9 cm thick copper cold - plate .",
    "the temperature of the hts was controlled with heating resistors and measured with a calibrated resistance and diode thermometers .",
    "the rotation rate was measured with an led and a photodiode .",

    "we used the lhc to measure the cof at levitation distances of 6 and 7.2 mm for various temperatures between 15 and 80 k and for frequencies between @xmath15 and 3.5 hz .",

    "we have presented a working prototype for an hts bearing for use with polarimeters that employ a hwp .",
    "the complete absence of stick - slip friction makes the magnetic bearing suitable for detector systems that are sensitive to microphonic excitation .",
    "our measurements indicate that with a readily available shimmed magnet and hts , at the range of gas pressures expected in a liquid he cryostat and with no particular efforts to reduce eddy current losses we can expect a cof of @xmath38 ( factor 2 less than the measured cof at 15 k due to shimming ) , which would give rise to an angular deceleration of about @xmath39 hz / sec .",
    "if the rotor is set in motion and then slows down over a frequency range of 20 hz , suitable for cmb observations between 21 and 1 hz given the time constant of current bolometeric detectors , the bearing would need to be reset in motion once in 33 hours .",
    "since re - setting the bearing in motion should take only a few minutes , the duty cycle of such a magnetic bearing system is close to 100% .",
    "the present design could be implemented in ground based or short duration balloon polarimeters .",
    "a cof of @xmath38 is still two orders of magnitude larger than the smallest cof reported for the 300 - 400 gr mass category @xcite , indicating that a more careful design of the bearing and the cryostat in which it operates can provide uninterrupted rotation for more than 4 months .",
    "even just a factor of 10 improvement in the cof would give a continuous rotation for a month , more than adequate for a long duration balloon mission .    with a slowly decelerating rotor",
    "the frequency where the polarization signal appears will also decrease .",
    "this could provide a powerful check on systematic errors , but could also complicate the analysis of the data .",
    "rather than let the bearing slow down over a long period of time , it could be driven continuously with an induction or standard brushless motor @xcite .",
    "if necessary a feed - back loop can be implemented to maintain constant speed .",
    "because of the small cof , minimal power is required to drive such a motor and this approach appears most attractive for a future satellite polarimetry mission .    despite of the success of our prototype",
    "more testing needs to be done to characterize the bearing performance .",
    "in particular it is essential to measure bearing oscillations , particularly at low temperatures where hysteretic damping is lower compared to 77 k , and the stability of the bearing parameters , e.g. stiffness , and levitation distance , should be tested over a long period of time .",
