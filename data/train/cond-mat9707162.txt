    ", the conductance of tl liquids with a single defect has been intensively discussed recently using various theoretical methods@xcite .",
    "it has been concluded that even a weak impurity eventually causes the conductance to vanish at low temperatures .",
    "the physical interpretation of the conductance vanishing is based on the assumption _  _ made by kane and fisher@xcite , that in the limit of low temperatures the behavior of a tl system with an impurity may be described as tunneling between two disconnected semi - infinite tl wires .",
    "the effective amplitude of tunneling between the half ",
    "wires scales to zero with decreasing temperature , because the tunneling density of states at the ending point of a tl liquid vanishes when the electron ",
    "electron interaction is repulsive@xcite .",
    "this interpretation corresponds to a scenario in which the effective strength of the impurity increases in the course of the renormalization , so that at the final stage a weak impurity transforms into a strong barrier , and disconnects the tl wire .",
    "however , a direct calculation of the tunneling density of states@xcite , obtained by a mapping of the weak impurity problem onto a coulomb gas theory , apparently contradicts this intuitive  picture .",
    "it has been found that at the location of a weak impurity the tunneling density of states is enhanced , rather than vanishing .",
    "the scenario of ref.@xcite is based on the assumption that no other fixed points intervene in the scaling from the repulsive fixed point of a weakly scattering defect to the attractive fixed point corresponding to a tunneling junction of two half - wires .",
    "the contradiction of this scenario to the calculations of single particle properties , such as the tunneling density of states , and the fermi edge singularity@xcite , indicates that maybe this is not the case .    in this work the problem of a single impurity in tl liquids with a repulsive electron ",
    "electron interaction is reinvestigated .",
    "we concentrate on the limit when the fermi wave length is much larger than the defect size .",
    "this situation is typical for semiconductors , where the filling of the conduction band is far from one half .",
    "then it is possible to describe the problem as a continuous model with an appropriately chosen point  like defect .",
    "we come to the conclusion that the low energy physics of a weak impurity is controlled by a fixed point that differs from the one corresponding to a tunneling junction of two half - wires .",
    "this aspect of the discussed problem proves to be similar to an overscreened two channel kondo  problem , while the original idea of the theory of ref.@xcite has been orientated to a situation similar to the ordinary kondo problem ( see also ref.@xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "the above statement may seem to be strange .",
    "indeed , in the overscreened two channel kondo  problem the infinitely strong exchange interaction corresponds to a repulsive fixed point@xcite , while in the problem under discussion the only apparent candidate for a fixed point in the strong coupling regime is the fixed point of a tunneling junction@xcite , which is attractive .",
    "we find here that there exists another fixed point corresponding to the infinitely strong amplitude of the impurity backward scattering , and it is repulsive .",
    "this implies that in addition there should be an attractive fixed point at a finite value of the backward scattering amplitude .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) flow diagram of the problem depends on several parameters characterizing the impurity , and is rather complex .",
    "each of the fixed points describing the backward scattering problem , as well as that of the tunneling junction , corresponds to a manifold of fixed points .",
    "an important fact is , that the tunneling junction manifold , and the two of the new fixed points describing backward scattering , are located in different parts of the rg flow diagram .    for a point  like defect ,",
    "all fourier components of an impurity potential are practically the same .",
    "therefore , one may characterize the  strength  of the potential by an initial ( bare ) value of a dimensionless parameter @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fermi velocity .",
    "when @xmath2 is small , the backward scattering problem is described by the partition function @xmath3 , depending on a backward scattering amplitude @xmath4 , and on the electron  electron interaction parameter @xmath5 .",
    "alternatively , when @xmath2 is large , i.e. , the impurity is strong , the appropriate description is a tunneling model with a partition function @xmath6 , depending on a tunneling amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "for free electrons , the two partition functions are deeply connected , because of the relation between the reflection from and the transmission through the defect . in this case , in principle , each one of them can represent an impurity of an arbitrary strength .",
    "the situation becomes quite different when the electron  electron interaction is switched on in tl liquids .",
    "then , the partition functions @xmath3 and @xmath8  are not equivalent anymore .",
    "instead , they describe two complementary limiting cases of the phase diagram , and give completely different structures of the rg fixed points for these cases .    in this paper , the rg flow diagram of the continuous model is analyzed by examining different ",
    "corners  of the scattering and the tunneling limits , and tailoring them together .",
    "the flow diagram is constructed in axes representing the strength of the impurity @xmath2 , and the backward scattering amplitude @xmath9 ( and/or @xmath10 ) , respectively .",
    "the presentation of the phase diagram in the space of the impurity potential parameters , rather than the conventional presentation in terms of the backward scattering amplitude together with the parameter @xmath5 , helps clarify the different character of the fixed points controlling the low energy physics in the cases of a weak and a strong bare impurity potential .",
    "in the course of renormalization of a weak impurity the effective barrier evolves in a special manner . only the backward scattering amplitude @xmath9 increases , while @xmath2 , being marginal , remains small .",
    "that is why a weak local impurity in a continuous model does not evolve towards a strong barrier , but proceeds to scale in the other , complementary , part of the rg flow diagram .",
    "the low energy physics in this case is controlled by a line of fixed points @xmath11 , at a finite value of @xmath9 .",
    "( more precisely , @xmath11 is a manifold of fixed points due to the presence of other marginal parameters .",
    "since we use a two  dimensional plot for the rg - diagram , we will call such manifolds  lines  . )",
    "the other part of the flow diagram contains a line of attractive fixed points , @xmath12 , controlling the low energy physics when the bare potential of the impurity is strong .",
    "this line describes the vanishing of the tunneling amplitude @xmath7 , and corresponds to two disconnected half - wires .",
    "we think that the attraction of the weak impurity problem to @xmath11 , but not to @xmath12 , is the reason for the difference between the results obtained by means of the coulomb gas theory for the single particle correlators , and those obtained relying on the scenario of two disconnected wires .",

    "in this section we reproduce the main results concerning the renormalization of the problem in the limits of a weak and of a strong impurity potential .",
    "we assume that the fermi wave length is much larger than the defect size .",
    "this situation occurs in semiconductor wires where the filling of the conduction band is far from one half and the fermi wave length is large .",

    "the tight binding model corresponds to a fixed choice of the parameters describing the defect , that makes this model a specific one . in this case",
    "the fermi wave length is commensurate with the impurity size , and the final fixed point depends on the internal structure of the defect@xcite .",

    "we now show that the odd part @xmath126 is effectively equivalent to the hamiltonian of a semi - infinite spin-@xmath14 antiferromagnetic chain with anisotropy @xmath127 : @xmath128 a hamiltonian of this type , with @xmath129 , has been introduced by guinea @xcite for the description of a quantum particle interacting with a dissipative environment , at a particular value of the friction coefficient .",
    "it has also been used to discuss the transmission through barriers in tl liquids@xcite , for a given value of the electron  electron interaction @xmath112 . here",
    "we introduce the @xmath130-term in order not to be limited to a particular value of the electron  electron interaction .",
    "note , that in @xmath131 , unlike the standard tight binding model ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the defect is located on a single site @xmath132 , and therefore it has no internal structure .",
    "this is consistent with our purpose to study a point - like impurity .    to show the equivalence of @xmath126 and @xmath131",
    ", one should perform a sequence of transformations . after applying the inverse of the jordan - wigner transformation@xcite @xmath133 @xmath131",
    "transforms into @xmath134 , where @xmath135 in the absence of the local magnetic field @xmath96 , the average of @xmath136 over the ground state @xmath137 of the spin chain is equal to zero . since    @xmath138 the sector @xmath139 corresponds to half filling . the local operator @xmath140 can not change the bulk properties of the chain .",
    "therefore , it will be assumed that the fermion system @xmath134 of eq.([eq : spinfermion ] )  is at half filling .",
    "the continuum limit of @xmath134 ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) corresponds to the effective hamiltonian @xmath141 , where @xmath142 , \\\\   h_{h } & = & v_{f}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\eta } } h\\left ( r(x=0)+l(x=0)+r^{\\dagger } ( x=0)+l^{\\dagger } ( x=0)\\right ) . \\end{array } \\label{eq : rl}\\ ] ] here @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the lattice spacing , and the operators @xmath44 and @xmath145 represent left and right movers on a semi - infinite line .",
    "the remnant of the discrete structure of the chain is the last term in @xmath146 which corresponds to the umklapp processes at half filling@xcite . this umklapp",
    "term scales to zero for @xmath147 , and also renormalizes the electron ",
    "electron interaction with a small momentum transfer .",

    "this yields : @xmath151 \\\\   &   & -\\frac{4v_{f}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi } \\eta } h\\cos \\left ( \\sqrt{4\\pi } \\theta _ { ch}(x=0)\\right ) , \\end{array } \\label{eq : chirall}\\ ] ] where @xmath152 diagonalizing the quadratic part of the hamiltonian , we find : @xmath153 , \\label{eq : chirallbar}\\ ] ] where @xmath154 @xmath155 , @xmath156arctanh@xmath157 , and @xmath158 .",
    "notice , the important role of the @xmath127-term  it modifies @xmath159 inside the cosine term .",
    "thus , as a result of the sequence of transformations @xmath160 we obtain that the hamiltonians @xmath131 and @xmath126 are equivalent when @xmath161 and@xmath162 . due to the @xmath163-term , this equivalence is extended here to a finite interval of the electron ",
    "electron interaction .",
    "we will use the equivalence of @xmath126 and @xmath131 to analyze the stability of the fixed line at @xmath13 and small @xmath2 .",
    "a simple variant of the nozires and blandin approach@xcite in their analysis of the two channel kondo problem will be considered . following this approach",
    ", we will assume that @xmath164 and check whether the fixed point @xmath165 is a stable one .    in the presence of a strong magnetic field @xmath115",
    ", the spin at site @xmath166 is oriented along the direction opposite to the magnetic field .",
    "its coupling to the nearest neighbor at the lattice site @xmath167 can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian that includes only sites @xmath166 and @xmath168 is given by @xmath169 after performing the permutation @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 we obtain the hamiltonian @xmath173 + \\frac{j}{4}\\left ( 1+% \\bar{\\gamma}\\right ) \\left [ s_{0}^{-}s_{1}^{+}+s_{0}^{+}s_{1}^{-}\\right ] -2hjs_{0}^{z}.   \\label{eq : jper2}\\ ] ] for @xmath115 the spin at site @xmath166 is in the state @xmath174 . up to the first order in @xmath175 we have",
    "@xmath176 this means that the spin at site @xmath168 is under the action of an effective magnetic field @xmath177 . under the assumption that @xmath115 , the higher orders in the perturbation theory give small corrections of the order of @xmath178 . as a result of this renormalization procedure step ,",
    "we arrive at a problem equivalent to the initial one : a semi - infinite spin-@xmath179 heisenberg chain , with a local magnetic field acting on the site at origin of the chain ( now it will be site @xmath168 ) .",
    "if one assumes that the discussed fixed point is such that the local magnetic field at the origin of the spin chain flows to infinity , then the renormalization procedure generates a relevant operator that makes this process nonconvergent .",
    "this is in contradiction with the initial assumption that @xmath95 is a stable fixed point .",
    "we have to conclude that @xmath180 is a repulsive fixed point .",
    "note , that this conclusion holds for a finite interval of the parameter @xmath181 , because @xmath182 does not radically influence the effective magnetic field acting on site @xmath168 .",
    "one can see this from the second order corrections to the energy of the anti - parallel and parallel spin configurations , that are @xmath183 .",
    "it is not accidental that the present discussion resembles the analysis of the overscreened two channel kondo problem@xcite .",
    "indeed , the spin chain model , in the absence of the @xmath127-term , is equivalent to the tl - impurity problem at a particular value of an electron ",
    "electron interaction parameter @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "the latter problem can in turn be reduced to a resonant level model@xcite . moreover , the overscreened two channel kondo model at a specific value of the longitudinal exchange coupling is equivalent to the same resonant level model",
    ". thus , the spin chain model and the kondo model are equivalent at one point . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that in the overscreened two channel kondo problem the limit of infinite exchange interaction is unstable , and there is an anomalous fixed point at a finite coupling@xcite .",
    "this property is preserved in the presence of the spin exchange anisotropy , which is irrelevant@xcite .",
    "since the spin chain model and the two channel kondo model are equivalent at one point , it is natural that we have found that the point @xmath95 is repulsive . since @xmath93",
    ", it follows from this analysis that the line @xmath184 is a repulsive fixed line for the problem of impurity scattering in a tl liquid .",
    "the present treatment is not restricted to the special point of a tl liquid with @xmath112 .",
    "this has been accomplished by the @xmath185 term in the spin chain model ."
