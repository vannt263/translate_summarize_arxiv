    "the rotational evolution of m dwarf ( dm ) stars can be inferred from observations of open clusters at different ages @xcite . in young ( @xmath3myr )",
    "open clusters , dm stars still present high rotation rates , which suggests that angular momentum losses at the early main - sequence phase are negligible for them @xcite . however , as the cluster ages ( @xmath4myr ) , the number of rapidly rotating dm stars decreases , implying that there should exist a mechanism of angular momentum removal that acts on time - scales of a few hundred million years @xcite . for solar - like main sequence stars ,",
    "the magnetised stellar wind is believed to spin down the star by carrying away stellar angular momentum .",
    "it has been observationally established that the angular velocity rate @xmath5 for solar - like stars varies as a function of age @xmath6 as @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that the empirical @xcite s law is not valid for low - mass stars , suggesting that a solar - type wind ( i.e. , with low velocities and mass - loss rates ) can not reproduce the rotational evolution of fully - convective stars .",
    "the existence of hot coronae , rapid rotation , and high levels of magnetic activity in dm stars suggests the presence of winds with an enhanced mass loss as compared to the solar wind .",
    "however , the low - density , optically thin winds of these stars prevents the observation of traditional mass - loss signatures , such as p  cygni profiles .",
    "the still unobserved high mass - loss rates from dm stars could be able to disperse debris discs , explaining why discs around dm stars older than @xmath8  myr are scarcely found @xcite .",
    "estimates of mass - loss rates from dm stars vary considerably .",
    "it has been suggested that the coronal winds of dm stars , despite of being very tenuous , possess mass - loss rates ( @xmath9 ) that can considerably exceed the solar value ( @xmath10 ) by factors of @xmath11 to @xmath12 , although @xcite claim an upper limit of @xmath13 for proxima centauri ( dm5.5e ) , @xmath14 times below the value of the solar wind mass - loss rate .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the coronal wind of a specific fully - convective dm star , v374  peg , for which observed surface magnetic maps have been acquired @xcite . for this",
    ", we use three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations based on our previous models developed for solar - like stars @xcite and weak - lined t tauri stars @xcite . for the first time , an observationally derived surface magnetic field map is implemented in mhd models of stellar winds for a low - mass star .",
    "v374  peg is a suitable case for modelling as a first step , because its surface magnetic distribution is close to potential , which implies that the adopted boundary conditions match the observed map closely .",
    "we self - consistently take into consideration the interaction of the outflowing wind with the magnetic field and vice - versa .",
    "hence , from the interplay between magnetic forces and wind forces , we are able to determine the configuration of the magnetic field and the structure of its coronal wind . more details of this work can be found in @xcite .",
    "v374  peg has mass @xmath15 , radius @xmath16 and is rotating with negligible differential rotation ( i.e. , as a solid body ) with a period of rotation @xmath17  d @xcite .",
    "we consider that its axis of rotation lies in the @xmath18-direction . to perform the simulations",
    ", we use the 3d mhd numerical code bats - r - us developed at university of michigan @xcite , which solves the ideal mhd equations .",
    "the simulations are initialised with a 1d hydrodynamical wind for a fully ionised plasma of hydrogen .",
    "immersed in this wind we consider a magnetic field anchored on the stellar surface that has a geometry derived from extrapolations from observed surface magnetic maps using the potential - field source surface ( pfss ) method ( figure  [ fig.ic]a ) . the mhd solution is evolved in time from the initial magnetic field configuration to a fully self - consistent solution ( figure  [ fig.ic]b )",
    "we do not adopt fixed topologies for either the magnetic field or for the wind , as both the wind and magnetic field lines are allowed to interact with each other .    in the pfss model , the stellar wind plasma",
    "is not included directly , but its effects on the magnetic field ( and vice - versa ) are incorporated through the inclusion of the source surface .",
    "such a surface , for instance , alters the number of open magnetic field lines , through where a stellar wind could escape .",
    "the source surface ( grey sphere in figure  [ fig.ic]a ) is chosen to lie at @xmath19 , where beyond that , the magnetic field is considered to be purely radial .",
    "pfss methods are usually criticised because their basic assumptions ( the magnetic field is a potential field and the source surface is spherical ) may not always be met .",
    "however , the advantage of the pfss method over the mhd models relies on its simplicity : it is simpler to implement and requires much less computer resources than mhd models . in our model",
    ", we use the magnetic field configuration derived by the pfss method as initial condition and boundary condition at the surface of the star .",
    "we note that the surface of the star that occupies co - latitudes @xmath20 is never in view as the star rotates and so the magnetic field there can not be reconstructed reliably .",
    "our simulations require a set of input parameters for the wind .",
    "unfortunately , some of them are poorly constrained by observations . for v374  peg ,",
    "the magnetic field is the better - constrained parameter .",
    "we have , therefore , implemented in our previous models @xcite surface magnetic maps derived by data acquired in 2005 aug @xcite .",
    "these observations show that v374  peg hosts an intense , mainly axi - symmetrical dipolar magnetic field , with maximum intensity of about @xmath21  g , i.e. , @xmath22 orders of magnitude larger than the sun .",
    "the wind temperature and density are less constrained for v374  peg .",
    "we , therefore , adopt values representative of dm stars .",
    "dm stars are believed to host coronae with a high - temperature plasma @xmath23  k in conjunction with a low - temperature one @xmath24 ",
    "@xmath25  k @xcite . in our models",
    ", we adopt a temperature at the base of the coronal wind of @xmath26  k or @xmath27  k. these coronal temperatures are about the same order of magnitude as the solar coronal temperatures of @xmath28k .",
    "coronal densities inferred from x - ray observations of dm stars suggest densities ranging from @xmath29  @xmath30 to @xmath31  @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , we adopt , at the base of the coronal wind , densities in the range @xmath29 ",
    "@xmath32  @xmath30 .",
    "compared to the solar coronal density of about @xmath33  @xmath30 , coronal densities inferred for dm stars are about @xmath24",
    " @xmath34 orders of magnitude larger than for the solar corona .",
    "the density , along with the magnetic field , are key parameters in defining the magnetic field configuration of the stellar wind and its velocity profile @xcite .",
    "together , they define the plasma-@xmath35 , defined by the ratio of thermal to magnetic energy densities .",
    "therefore , at the base of the coronal wind of v374  peg , @xmath36 where the index `` 0 '' means the variable is evaluated at the base of the coronal wind , @xmath37  @xmath38 and @xmath39  k ) . for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 is about @xmath14 orders of magnitude smaller than for the solar wind @xcite .",
    "this implies that the winds of dm stars are highly magnetised and , therefore , are expected to differ from solar - type winds .",
    "table  [ table ] presents the parameters adopted for the set of simulations we performed .",

    "in general , mhd wind models are studied under the assumption of simplistic magnetic field configurations , especially when in pursuit of an analytical solution .",
    "therefore , the study of a magnetised coronal wind where an observed magnetic field distribution is considered has long been awaited .",
    "our work also sheds some light on the yet unobserved winds from dm stars .    by comparing cases",
    "where only the base coronal density @xmath43 was varied , we found that the poloidal velocity of the wind scales approximately as @xmath69 this qualitatively agrees with previous results @xcite , where it was found that an increase in the density leads to winds with lower velocities .",
    "simulations presented here are in a very low-@xmath35 regime , where magnetic effects completely override thermal and kinematic effects of the wind .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eq.windlaw ] ) should be treated with caution , as under different @xmath35 regimes ( for example , when it approaches @xmath70 ) , it becomes invalid .",

    "we note that the wind terminal velocity is @xmath74 ",
    "@xmath75 n_{12}^{-1/2}~{\\rm km~s}^{-1}$ ] , where the range of velocities refers to different wind latitudes ( low - wind velocity near the equator , high - wind velocity around the poles ) .",
    "because the magnetic field in the lower hemisphere of the star is not reliably reconstructed ( co - latitudes @xmath20 of the surface of the star are not observed ) , a high - velocity wind develops there .",
    "although this feature is local and does not affect the remaining parts of the grid other than radially away from the stellar surface , it is an artifact of our method and should not be taken into consideration ( e.g. , see the accumulation of magnetic field lines near the low - hemisphere of the star in figures  [ fig.windvel]a and [ fig.windvel]b ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq.windlaw ] ) also implies that the mass - loss rate of the wind ( @xmath76 ) should scale as @xmath77 which means that , despite the fact that the wind velocity of case 3map is @xmath11 times smaller than case 1map [ eq .",
    "( [ eq.windlaw ] ) ] , its mass - loss rate is one order of magnitude larger than for case 1map [ eq .",
    "( [ eq.windmassloss ] ) ] .",
    "this has implications on the efficiency of angular momentum loss , as will be shown later .",
    "the mass - loss rates for cases 1map , 2map , and 3map are @xmath78 .    figure  [ fig.windvel]b shows the scaled poloidal velocity profile @xmath71 for case 4map .",
    "this case considers a different temperature at the base of the corona ( @xmath27  k as opposed to @xmath79  k ) , and , because of that , has a larger @xmath42 ( table  [ table ] ) . for this case",
    ", we did not find an analytical expression relating velocity and temperature .",
    "the alfvn surface location and configuration of magnetic field lines are similar to the other dipolar cases , but the scaled wind velocity @xmath71 is smaller than the previous cases : @xmath80 ",
    "@xmath81 n_{12}^{-1/2}~{\\rm km~s}^{-1}$ ]",
    ". the lower velocity observed in case 4map happens because of its higher @xmath42 .",
    "the mass - loss rate for case 4map is @xmath82 .",
    "overall , our solutions differ considerably from the solar wind solution , where a low - velocity wind ( terminal velocities of @xmath83  @xmath84  km  s@xmath85 ) with low mass - loss rate ( @xmath10 ) is found .",
    "we note that , based on more simplistic wind models , such as @xcite , in the fast magnetic rotator limit , wind terminal velocities of @xmath86 are expected for a wind mass - loss rate of about @xmath87 .",
    "observations of the rotation evolution of dm stars in open clusters at different ages provide a way to constrain the time - scale @xmath46 for the angular - momentum loss .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath88  myr or , mostly likely @xmath89 ",
    "@xmath84  myr , @xcite for dm stars .",

    "( [ eq.jdot ] ) does not contribute to the @xmath18-component torque and is therefore null .",
    "the second term disappears in the case of a spherical alfvn surface , but it is non - null in the cases where a surface magnetic map is considered and it becomes relatively more important for the cases with larger adopted @xmath42 .",
    "the third term is the dominant term in our simulations .",
    "we can estimate the time - scale for rotational braking as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the angular momentum of the star . if we assume a spherical star with a uniform density , then @xmath102 and the time - scale is @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the rotational period of the star .",
    "for v374  peg , this results in @xmath105 because @xmath45 depends on the mass flux crossing a given surface , i.e. , on the mass - loss rate of the wind @xmath9 , from eq .",

    "the most plausible wind density is the one used for models 1map .",
    "such a density is also able to reproduce typical emission measures of dm stars ( @xmath111 ) and comparatively ( with the remaining cases ) smaller mass - loss rates and higher wind velocities .",
    "ultimately , when the star ages , the stellar rotation brakes , reducing the stellar surface magnetic field intensity , and therefore the wind velocity .    with the inclusion of an observed distribution of surface magnetic field ,",
    "we head towards a more realistic modelling of magnetised coronal winds .",
    "never the less , our model presents limitations , such as the neglect of a detailed energy balance .",
    "instead , we consider a polytropic relation between pressure and density parametrised through @xmath112 in the derivation of the energy equation of the wind .",
    "once the magnetic field distribution is set , the thermal pressure adjusts itself in order to provide a distribution of heating / cooling that is able to support the mhd solution obtained @xcite .",
    "if the wind of v374  peg is able to cool down , e.g. , by radiative cooling not considered in our models , the terminal velocities of the wind could be considerably smaller .",
    "depending on where in the wind energy deposition ( or removal ) occurs , the wind velocity may change , without affecting the mass - loss rates .",
    "for instance , if a substantial cooling occurs above the alfvn surface , the velocity profile of the wind from that point outwards will be affected . as the information of what is happening above the alfvn point can not be transmitted to the sub - alfvnic region , the wind density and velocity profiles in the proximity of the star will not be changed , and consequently neither the stellar mass - loss / angular momentum - loss rates .          ,",
