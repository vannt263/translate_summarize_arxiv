    "supersymmetric bps brane solutions play a very important role in the description of string theory and gauge theories .",
    "especially it became clear , that one can study gauge theories via various supersymmetric brane configurations embedded in flat spacetime .",
    "this approach is particularly attractive since a lot of informations about the nonperturbative gauge dynamics can be obtained by lifting the brane configurations to 11d m - theory @xcite , where branes preserving a certain amount of the 32 supercharges of m - theory are described by calibrated surfaces @xcite .",
    "for example , gauge theories with eight unbroken supercharges ( @xmath2 supersymmetry in four dimensions ) correspond to @xmath3 special lagrangian ( slag ) calibrations @xcite .",
    "similarly , gauge theories with four unbroken supercharges can be associated to @xmath4-slag calibrations , the case which was discussed in @xcite . however , unlike the supersymmetric 2-cycles , the supersymmetric 3-cycles and all higher odd dimensional slag cycles are very difficult to construct explicitly .",
    "concrete applications requires a simple handling of such m5-brane solutions .",
    "unfortunately for the @xmath4-slag only extremely special solutions could be written down so far .",
    "therefore one is looking for constructions which connect geometries of different dimensions to each other . in this context",
    "a very exciting construction exists @xcite ,    = -14 = 5.5 cm which connects lagrangian submanifolds of different dimensions .",
    "the construction given there generates a smoothly varying phase @xmath5 on the projected cycles which prevents it to be slag ( @xmath6 ) again ( see fig.[figureprojection ] ) .",
    "we will show that supersymmetric solutions of the latter type exist where the non constant phase can be related to the 3 form field @xmath1 which appears in the general equations of motions of the m5-brane in a recent paper @xcite similar modified geometries are investigated in iia & iib theory in the presence of @xmath7 and @xmath8 fields .. in order to understand this `` projection principle '' we will analyze the complete bps equations of the , which includes additional terms with the capability to modify the differential equations of the slag conditions .",
    "such terms appear naturally after turning on the 3 form field @xmath1 and after breaking further supersymmetries .",
    "+ as a byproduct one can use these equations to discuss supersymmetric m5-brane solutions in a background including a constant 3 form field @xmath9 of 11d sugra .",
    "this discussion is also motivated by the recent study of yang - mills theory in a noncommutative geometry @xcite .",
    "in this way one might obtain nonperturbative informations about noncommutative yang - mills theories via @xmath1-deformed sw - curves .",
    "+ for concreteness , we will focus on the cases of supersymmetric 2-cycles and show how the slag conditions are affected by the @xmath1-fields .",
    "the arguments are generic and can be generalized to all @xmath10-slag cases as well .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we analyze the bps equations of @xcite showing that slag submanifolds become lag in the presence of the field @xmath1 .",
    "in static gauge the embedding of the m5-brane into flat 11d spacetime is realized by a map @xmath11 , which describes the dependence of the transverse coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 on the brane coordinates @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore there lives a two - form field @xmath16 on the six - dimensional worldvolume of the m5-brane with field strength @xmath17 .",

    "in particular the 11d gamma matrices @xmath28 are constructed out of @xmath29 and @xmath30 gamma matrices by a general property of clifford algebras . for the case at hand",
    "we obtain : @xmath31 @xmath32 is the chirality operator of the algebra @xmath33",
    ". then the explicit coordinate expression of the last formula for a flat 11d sugra background as derived in @xcite reads : @xmath34 @xmath35   + here @xmath36 are the chiral @xmath29 tangent space gamma matrices on the m5-brane and @xmath37 the @xmath30 gamma matrices of the transverse space . without further specialisations",
    "the only solution is given by a flat m5-brane preserving one half of spacetime supersymmetry .",
    "on the other hand if there are some nontrivial identities of products of gamma matrices applied to the spinor @xmath38 one obtains differential equations which determine more general supersymmetric m5-brane solution .",
    "the amount of supersymmetry preserved by such a solution is determined by the number of relations imposed on the 11d gamma algebra .",
    "+      in the following we concentrate on those projectors which determine the special lagrangian geometries .",
