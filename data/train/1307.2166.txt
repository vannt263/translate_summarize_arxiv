    "plays a role of fundamental importance .",
    "the fact that for most dynamical systems the periodic orbits are dense in the set of all possible solutions , at least in certain parts of the phase space , necessitates the presence of an efficient numerical method for their determination . over the last decades",

    "here we must point out , that the basic relations regarding the position and the period of the periodic orbits presented in the previous section , are very simple .",

    "the outermost blue line is the zero velocity curve ( zvc ) which includes all the invariant curves at the @xmath59 plane and is defined as @xmath66    the plots of the two types of 1:1 resonant periodic orbits are given in fig .",

    "[ f11u_tesc ] that the escape period of the orbits is decreasing rapidly as the value of the energy increases .",

    "the main advantage of this procedure is that the fourth - order polynomials giving the position and the period of the periodic orbits contain only one variable which is the value of the energy .",
    "we began our investigation from the f11s family which contains the 1:1 straight - line periodic orbits .",
    "this is indeed a very interesting family because the periodic orbits of this family undergo an infinity of transitions to instability and stability as @xmath22 tends to @xmath25 , while the period of these orbits tends to infinity .",

    "moreover , we found that the vast majority of the periodic orbits remain or become unstable when @xmath0 .",
    "we observed , that each resonance family behaves differently upon approaching the escape energy .",
    "in fact , the evolution of a resonance family beyond @xmath25 depends mainly on the particular type of the periodic orbits of the family .",
    "as we have seen , in each resonance case there are two types of periodic orbits : ( i ) stable periodic orbits corresponding to elliptic points in the pss and ( ii ) unstable periodic orbits corresponding to saddle points in the phase plane . if we compare the periodic orbits shown in figs .",

    ".    finally , we made a thorough investigation in all families of periodic orbits when @xmath0 .",
    "our main objective , was to compute the escape period and also to determine the escape position of the orbits .",
    "the escape period is defined as the required time interval so that an orbit to intersect one of the four lyapunov orbits .",
    "our numerical calculations , suggested that the escape period in all families is rapidly reduced as the value of the energy increases .",
    "only for values of the energy very close to @xmath25 the escape time is considerable high .",

    "the width of an escape channel can , in a way , be defined as the distance between the two points at which a lyapunov orbit intersects the two opposite branches of the zvc .",
    "thus , as the value of the energy increases the escape channels becoming more and more wide and therefore , the unstable orbits need less and less time in order to find one of the four available openings and eventually escape to infinity .    in the case of the f11u family",
    ", we found that there is a small energy range beyond @xmath25 which contains several unstable 1:1 periodic orbits that do not escape even if we integrated them for a time interval of @xmath97 time units .",
    "therefore , these are trapped unstable orbits . considering the unstable nature of these orbits , it is very likely , that if we integrate them for much more time they will eventually escape . on the other hand , the trapped periodic orbits we found in f13s family are stable and therefore , we have strong numerical evidence that they remain trapped regardless of the total time of the numerical integration .",
    "we may say , that in general terms , the choice regarding which escape channel will follow each orbit is completely random , even though that in some resonance families we can distinguish minor patterns only for small ranges of the energy .",
    "however , almost in every resonance case there is a favorite channel chosen by the majority of the orbits .",
    "we consider the outcomes of the present research as an initial effort in the task of exploring the evolution of families of resonant periodic orbits .",
    "since our current results are encouraging , it is in our future plans to study and reveal the evolution and the stability of periodic orbits in more complicated dynamical system such as galactic models .",
    "moreover , we plan to expand our numerical methods in order to trace and locate three - dimensional resonant periodic orbits .",
    "i would like to express my warmest thanks to the two anonymous referees for the careful reading of the manuscript and for their very positive comments and aptly suggestions , which allowed us to improve both the quality and the clarity of the present article .",
