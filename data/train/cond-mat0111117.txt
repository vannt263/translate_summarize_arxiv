    "spin cast polymer films are used in many industrial sectors ( electronics , packaging , ... ) .  but",
    "the birth of the films is complex : during the ( rapid ) solvent evaporation , many things happen .",
    "in particular , one can think of :    \\a ) thermal ( rayleigh benard ) instabilities ( since the free surface is cooled down ) .",
    "\\b ) convective instabilities due to concentration effects ( when the surface tension of the polymer @xmath0 is higher than the surface tension of the solvent @xmath1 ) : a solvent rich plume lowers the surface tension , and this enhances the plume .",
    "we recently argued @xcite that ( when @xmath2 ) process ( b ) should dominate over process ( a ) .    in the present note ,",
    "we are concerned with another phenomenon .",
    "strawhecker et al @xcite found that the surface roughness of the final films is anomalously high ( @xmath3 ) when the pure solvent has a high vapor pressure .",
    "this can not be explained by process ( b ) above : a number of polymer solvent pairs with @xmath4 give a smooth surface ( e.g. ps / toluene on pvme / water ) .",
    "also , some systems with @xmath5 , give a rough surface ( e.g. ps / acetone or pvme / methanol ) .",
    "this led us to another line of thought , based on the glassy nature of the final state : a polymer rich  crust  builds up near the free surface : when it dries out , it is under tension and it should rupture -creating a rough surface .    in section 2 , we discuss the concentration profiles in the film , and the formation of the crust .",
    "this has been analysed many years ago in precise numerical  calculations by bornside , macosko and scriven @xcite.here we set up a much cruder , but more transparent , model . in section 3 , we produce a crude estimate of the mechanical tensions , and discuss the possible forms of rupture .",
    "all our analysis is qualitative : any improvement on this would require a deep ( non existent ) knowledge of the glass transition induced by solvent depletion .",
    "the aspect of the concentration profiles at one , given instant @xmath6 during evaporation is shown on fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the solvent volume fraction @xmath7 has a high value @xmath8 at the bottom plate , and a low value @xmath9 at the free surface . immediately above this",
    ", we have @xmath10 .",
    "this value corresponds to a solvent partial pressure @xmath11 in the neighboring gas . inside the gas",
    ", we assume a diffusion layer of fixed thickness @xmath12 : this is a crude approximation to the actual boundary layers which are associated with air motions in the laboratory .",
    "the outward solvent current ( in air ) is related to a diffusion coefficient @xmath13    @xmath14    here , @xmath15 is the number density of solvent just above the interface ,  and @xmath16 is a number of molecules per unit area and unit time .",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath17 is of order v@xmath18 , where v@xmath19 is the thermal velocity for solvent molecules of mass @xmath20 , and @xmath21 the mean free path in air ( inversely  proportional to the atmospheric pressure @xmath22 ) .",
    "this gives ultimately :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the size of a solvent molecule .",
    "we are thus led to an evaporation current :    @xmath25      we assume , for simplicity , that the volume fractions just below ( @xmath26 ) and just above ( @xmath27 ) the interface are related by henry s law , with a constant coefficient :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the vapor pressure of pure solvent .",
    "this assumption ignores many delicacies in the sorption  desorption curves @xcite , @xcite , but it should be sufficient for our purposes .",
    "eqs ( [ eq3 ] , [ eq4 ] ) then give us :    @xmath30    ( where @xmath31 is the volume per solvent molecule in the liquid solvent ) .",
    "inside the crust , we assume that a steady state is achieved , with the same current @xmath16 .",
    "if we call @xmath32 the diffusion coefficient of the solvent in the mixture , we may write :    @xmath33    the coefficient @xmath34 varies with @xmath7 for two reasons :    \\a ) the mesh size @xmath35 of the polymer solution increases with @xmath7 @xmath36    \\b ) at low @xmath7 the system is glassy and @xmath34 becomes very small .",
    "effect ( a ) is minor compared with effect ( b ) , and we shall omit it in the following . to get a practical feeling about @xmath34 in the small @xmath7 region , it is helpful to use a free volume picture for the glass transition @xcite .",
    "the free volume parameter v has one component v@xmath37 present in pure polymer and another component proportional to the volume fraction of solvent :    @xmath38    ( where @xmath39 is a coefficient of order unity ) .",
    "we shall focus our attention on the region where solvent effects dominate over temperature effects ( @xmath40v@xmath41this then gives :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is another coefficient of order unity , and @xmath44 is the diffusion constant in a very fluid mixture ( @xmath45 ) .  where we know an explicit form of @xmath34 such as eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , we can find the steady state profile in the crust region by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) over , as thickness @xmath46 near the free surface :    @xmath47    eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) holds only in the region of small @xmath48 , which acts as a barrier , when the assumption @xmath49 is valid .",
    "outside of the barrier , diffusion is fast and the profile @xmath50 is nearly flat .    note that the presence of a crust , as it is understood here , is independent of the presence ( or absence ) of an adsorbed polymer layer near the free surface .",
    "an adsorbed layer will be present if @xmath5 , and if the adsorption time is shorter @xcite than the overall time for spin casting .",
    "but this layer is expected to be very thin ; the number @xmath51 of adsorbed monomers per unit area should be @xmath52 : a thin layer like this can not be really glassy , and does not contribute significantly to the crust .",
    "we can now define the thickness of the crust @xmath53 via the initial slope at @xmath54 ( the free surface ) :    @xmath55    using eqs ( [ eq5 ] , [ eq6 ] ) , this gives :    @xmath56    the solvent fracture @xmath57 decreases with time : at a certain instant @xmath58 , it reaches a critical value @xmath59 below which the polymer solvent system is glassy .",
    "the central parameter is the crust thickness @xmath60 at this moment :    @xmath61    for instance , let us use the general form [ eq8 ] for @xmath34 , with @xmath62 and @xmath63taking @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66v@xmath67 , we arrive at @xmath68 nanometers .",
    "thus the crust is indeed thin for practical conditions .",
    "another important feature of eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) , is the dependence on the vapor pressure @xmath69 : _ large vapor pressures lead to thin crusts_.  this , in turn , implies that the crust will be more fragile , as discussed in section 3 .",
    "the birth of the crust occurs at a certain time @xmath58 ( when @xmath70 ) .  at a later time @xmath71 ,",
    "the whole film becomes glassy ( when @xmath72 ) .",
    "we shall now assume that @xmath73 is ( like @xmath58 ) , proportional to the overall evaporation time @xmath74 .",
    "a simplified discussion of @xmath75 is given below .",
    "we concentrate on regimes where @xmath53 is smaller than the overall thickness @xmath76 .",
    "then , the total amount of solvent in the film is @xmath77 ( per unit area of film ) .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath78 is given by :    @xmath79    where the first term describes evaporation , while the second term is related to the presence of a moving boundary .",
    "the conservation of polymer imposes :    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the final thickness of the dry film .",
    "eqs ( [ eq13 ] , [ eq14 ] ) must still be supplemented by one relation relating @xmath82 to @xmath26 .",
    "we shall obtain this in a very crude fashion , by considering the cross over point between crust and  inside  the film .",
    "we assume that at @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 is a numerical coefficient of order 2 ) , the diffusion coefficient @xmath34 has become fast : then the profile is flat , and this implies @xmath85 .",
    "thus , we are led to the ansatz :    @xmath86    then the system ( [ eq13]-[eq15 ] ) can be reduced to :    @xmath87    with :    @xmath88    eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) can be integrated in detail .",
    "but , for our purposes , it is enough to note that it involves a single time",
    "constant @xmath89    @xmath90    in the form ( [ eq18 ] ) , @xmath91 is exactly the relaxation time in the final stage , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be neglected .",
    "thus , we are led to postulate that the duration of the crust regime follows the scaling rule :    @xmath94",
    "we now focus our attention on the interval @xmath95 , where the crust is present over a sheet of fluid solution . during this interval , the volume fraction @xmath57 at the free surface decreases from @xmath96 down to a finite fraction of @xmath96 -say @xmath97 : this would ensure that the volume fraction at the bottom plate @xmath98 reaches the threshold @xmath99 at the end of the interval .    following the ideas of leibler and sekimoto @xcite",
    ", we believe that a network is formed in the crust as soon as @xmath57 reaches @xmath100 at later times , this network is deswollen ( as explained on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , because @xmath7 decreases down to @xmath101 .",
    "the volume of the gel decreases , but its horizontal dimensions have to remain the same .",
    "thus , there is a tensile stress in the crust .            where we have replaced the elastic  modulus of the gel by the osmotic pressure of the polymer @xmath105 , which scales in the same way .",
    "because at @xmath106 we are dealing with rather concentrated solutions , we may write simply @xcite :          with the usual values of @xmath96 ( 0,2 ) , this should be sufficient to induce fracture in the crust .",
    "fracture is indeed favored because  a ) the crust is thin  b ) it must have the usual syneresis , leading to rather open regions which can play the role of a nucleation center .",
    "thus , we are led to suggest that the outer surface of the film exhibits a network of fracture lines at times @xmath109 , very much like earth at the bottom of a drying pond .",
    "the evaporation flows should then converge towards these fracture lines , and a rough interface should appear .",
    "we are not able to predict the density of cracks , nor the amplitude of the resultant roughness .",
    "but it is clear that this process should be important , mainly when the crust is thin .  by eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) this requires a high vapor pressure @xmath29 for the solvent -in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "\\b ) some direct observation may be possible .",
    "crusts have been observed in deswelling experiments by tanaka and coworkers @xcite , using optical microscopes .",
    "they did see crust rupture after some deswelling . in the present case",
    ", it may be better to probe the surface ( after complete drying ) with an afm  tip .      to summarize : all our discussion is extremely qualitative , and it may be insufficient at some points",
    ".  however , we believe that  a ) the compact formula ( [ eq12 ] ) for the crust thickness may be useful  b ) crust rupture is indeed a plausible explanation for the surface roughness of the films ."
