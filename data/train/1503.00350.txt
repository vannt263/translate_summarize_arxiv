    "any isolated population , which regulates itself via random births and deaths , is doomed to extinction @xcite .",
    "large and therefore long - lived stochastic populations ultimately go extinct via a rare sequence of events when random population losses dominate over gains .",
    "this basic extinction scenario , unaccounted for by deterministic theory , is at work in many situations in physics , chemistry , biology and other fields .",
    "one example from epidemiology is extinction of an endemic disease from a population when no new infectives arrive @xcite .",
    "prior to extinction , a large population resides in a long - lived quasi - stationary state , with a lifetime ( the mean time to extinction ) which is exponentially large in the average population size  @xcite .",
    "it has been long recognized that extinction is prevented by immigration : via either colonization of empty regions , or the  rescue effect \" @xcite .",
    "similarly , arrival of new infected individuals can restart the epidemics in a population which has recovered from an infection .",
    "mathematically , by introducing a constant immigration flux into a stochastic population model , one eliminates the absorbing state at zero population size and therefore prevents extinction . an important additional effect that many populations exhibit is the allee effect , by which population biologists mean a group of effects causing a reduction in the per - capita growth rate at small population sizes @xcite . in the language of deterministic theory ,",
    "a strong allee effect introduces a non - zero critical population size for establishment .",
    "if there is no immigration , and the initial population size is smaller than the critical size , the population goes extinct quickly .",
    "if the initial population size is greater than the critical size , a long - lived state with a large population size appears . we will call this state the colonization state . in the presence of low immigration pressure ( by which ecologists mean small immigration rate ) the absorbing zero - population state gives way to the pre - colonization state : a state with a small population size . as a result",
    ", the population can be either in the pre - colonization state , or the colonization state .",
    "the demographic noise ( which , for large populations , is weak ) causes rare switches between the two states .",
    "we will assume that the allee effect is sufficiently strong so that this critical population size is large , see sec .",
    "[ model ] for details . here",
    "we evaluate the mean time to colonization ( mtc ) , which we define as the mean switching time between the pre - colonization and colonization states .",
    "noise - induced switching between long - lived states is a classical paradigm of statistical physics going back to kramers @xcite . in the context of population dynamics ,",
    "describable as a continuous - time markov process with a discrete space of states , accurate and useful general expressions for the mean switching time have only become available recently .",
    "to begin with , for single - population systems with single - step processes ( that is , when there are only transitions between a state with @xmath0 individuals and a state with @xmath1 individuals ) , an exact analytical expression for the ( properly defined ) mean switching time can be obtained  @xcite by solving a recursive equation for the mean first passage time , see sec .",
    "[ comparison ] .",
    "this expression , however , is extremely cumbersome and not very informative .",
    "furthermore , for multiple - step processes no exact solutions are available . these difficulties may explain the common practice , especially in the population biology literature @xcite , of using the so called  diffusion approximation \" .",
    "in this approximation the mean switching time is evaluated from a fokker - planck equation that is derived from the original master equation via a truncated system - size expansion @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the diffusion approximation breaks down in the tails of the quasi - stationary distribution . as shown in many studies",
    "@xcite , this leads to errors in the mean switching time that are exponentially large in the population size , thus invalidating the whole calculation .",
    "a robust and efficient way of evaluating the mean switching time in large populations is provided by a dissipative variant of wkb approximation @xcite that employs the average population size as a large parameter and is applied directly to the original master equation @xcite . in this way dykman et al @xcite calculated the effective entropic barrier that determines the mean switching time up to a pre - exponential factor .",
    "more recently , meerson and sasorov @xcite used the wkb formalism to calculate , for a specific model , the mean switching time with account of the pre - exponential factor .",
    "this calculation requires going to the sub - leading order of the wkb theory and also dealing with a vicinity of the unstable fixed point where wkb theory breaks down .",

    "@xcite was extended to a general set of reactions by escudero and kamenev @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "this assumption breaks down when the immigration pressure is so small that the average population size in the pre - colonization state is @xmath2 or less . indeed , in some ecological systems the population dynamics represents a series of recurrent extinctions and colonizations ( the  rescue effect \" ) @xcite .",
    "in this case , and in other , milder , cases @xcite , the immigration rate is very small , and the situation calls for approximations that would respect the non - wkb character of the pre - colonization state . here",
    "we develop an approximate method that yields the mtc and the long - lived quasi - stationary distribution ( qsd ) of population sizes in the situation when the pre - colonization state is of a non - wkb nature .",
    "the method holds for a broad range of immigration rates . for single - step processes it does not employ wkb approximation altogether , whereas for multiple - step processes the wkb approximation is only used for sufficiently large @xmath0 where it is justified .",
    "an important element of our method is the zero - flux solution of the quasi - stationary master equation which can be found by recursion . for single - step processes ,",

    ", we determine the probability flux and evaluate the mtc .",
    "the resulting mtc exhibits an entropic barrier , so that the mtc is exponentially long .",
    "we show that the wkb approximation remains remarkably accurate at quite low immigration pressures , well beyond conservative estimates . as the immigration pressure decreases ,",
    "the wkb prediction starts to fail . at not too small immigration rates ,",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of colonization of a territory by a stochastic population at low immigration pressure . we assume a sufficiently strong allee effect that introduces , in deterministic theory , a large critical population size for colonization . at low immigration rates , </S>",
    "<S> the average pre - colonization population size is small thus invalidating the wkb approximation to the master equation . </S>",
    "<S> we circumvent this difficulty by deriving an exact zero - flux solution of the master equation and matching it with an approximate non - zero - flux solution of the pertinent fokker - planck equation in a small region around the critical population size . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure provides an accurate evaluation of the quasi - stationary probability distribution of population sizes in the pre - colonization state , and of the mean time to colonization , for a wide range of immigration rates . at sufficiently high immigration rates </S>",
