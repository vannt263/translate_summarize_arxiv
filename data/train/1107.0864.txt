    "the change point problem has been considered and studied by several authors the last five decades .",
    "change point analysis is a statistical tool for determining whether a change has taken place at a point of a sequence of observations , such that the observations are described by one distribution up to that point and by another distribution after that point .",
    "change - point analysis concerns with the detection and estimation of the point at which the distribution changes .",
    "one change point problem or multiple change points problem have been studied in the literature , depending on whether one or more change points are observed in a sequence of random variables .",
    "several methods , parametric or non - parametric , have been developed to approach the solution of this problem while the range of applications of change point analysis is broad .",
    "applications can be encountered in many areas such as statistical quality control , public health , medicine , finance , biomedical signal processing , meteorology , seismology , etc .",
    "the monograph by chen and gupta ( 2000 )  summarizes recent developments in parametric change - point analysis .",
    "typical situations encountered in the literature of parametric multiple change points analysis are as follows : let @xmath0 be @xmath1 independent @xmath2-variate observations ( @xmath3 ) and let @xmath4 the statistical space associated with the random variable ( r.v . )",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the probability density function with respect to a @xmath7-finite measure @xmath8 given by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath6 , @xmath11 . for simplicity",
    ", @xmath8 is either the lebesgue measure or a counting measure .",
    "we adopt in the sequel the formulation of the multiple change point problem as it appeared in srivastava and worsley ( 1986 ) and chen and gupta ( 2000 , 2004 ) . based on these authors ,",
    "suppose that adjacent observations are grouped in @xmath12 groups , so that @xmath13 , are in the first group , @xmath14 , are in the second group and we continue in a similar manner until @xmath15 are in the @xmath12-th group .",
    "consider the model for changes in the parameters .",
    "this is formulated as a problem of testing the following hypotheses,@xmath16 versus the alternative@xmath17 where @xmath12 , @xmath18 , is the unknown number of changes and @xmath19 are the unknown positions of the change points .",
    "the above hypotheses can be equivalently stated in the form@xmath20 versus the alternative@xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "there is an extensive bibliography on the subject and several methods to search for the change point problem have appeared in the literature . among them , the generalized likelihood ratio test , bayesian solution of the problem , information criterion approaches , cumulative sum method , etc .",
    "based on these methods , several papers discuss the change - point problems in specific probabilistic models , like the univariate and multivariate normal distribution , the gamma model and the exponential model . for instance , sen and srivastava ( 1980 ) focused on the single change - point problem .",
    "moreover , they consider that within each section , the distributions are the same , while the distribution in a section is different from that in the preceding and the following section in mean vector or covariance matrix . for an exposition of these methods and their application to specific distributions",
    "we refer to the monograph or the survey paper by chen and gupta ( 2000 , 2001 ) and the references appeared therein .",
    "it has been proposed in these and other treatments ( cf .",
    ", for instance , vostrikova ( 1981 ) ) , that in order to study the multiple change point problem , which is formulated by ( [ e1 ] ) or ( [ e2 ] ) , we just need to test the single change point hypothesis and then to repeat the procedure for each subsequence .",
    "hence , we turn to the testing of ( [ e2 ] ) against the alternative,@xmath23 where the symbol @xmath24  is used to denote that the observations on the left follow the parametric density on the right . in ( [ e3 ] ) , @xmath25 represents the position a single change point , which is supposed to be unknown .",
    "a general description of this technique in the detection of the changes is summarized in the following steps by chen and gupta ( 2001 ) .",
    "first we test for no change point versus one change point , that is , we test the null hypothesis given by ( [ e2 ] ) versus the alternative given by ( [ e3 ] ) and equivalently stated by @xmath26 : @xmath27 . here",
    ", @xmath25 is the unknown location of the single change point .",
    "if @xmath28 is not rejected , then the procedure is finished and there is no change point .",
    "if @xmath28 is rejected , then there is a change point and we continue with the step 2 . in the second step we test separately the two subsequences before and after the change point found in the first step for a change . in the sequel , we repeat these two steps until no further subsequences have change points . at the end of the procedure ,",
    "the collection of change point locations found by the previous steps constitute the set of the change points .",
    "the subject of change point analysis is twofold . on the one hand to detect if there is one or more changes in a sequence of observation .",
    "the second aspect of change point analysis is the estimation of the number of changes and their corresponding locations . in this paper",
    "we will develop an information theoretic procedure which is based on divergence , in order to study the change point problem .",
    "the measures background is a general parametric , univariate or multivariate family of distributions .",
    "we describe formally the framework and the problem in section [ sec1 ] , and the main results are presented in section [ sec2 ] . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we focus our interest on a specific distribution , the binomial distribution and a simulation study is performed in order to compare the accuracy the new test - statistic with some pre - existing test - statistics . in the final section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "the general results of this paper are illustrated by means of the well - known lisdisfarne scribes data set .",
    "consider now the single change point problem , that is the problem of testing the pair of hypotheses    @xmath29    which are presented by ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) , respectively . in the above formulation , @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "are unknown .",
    "since @xmath25 is the unknown location of the single change point , we will consider all the candidate points @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 denotes the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) of @xmath30 which is based on the random sample @xmath34 from @xmath35 and let @xmath36 denotes the m.l.e . of @xmath31 which is based on the random sample @xmath37 from @xmath38 .",
    "if the hypothesis @xmath26 is true , then there is a difference between the probabilistic models @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which cause a large value for a measure of the distance between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . given that the @xmath41-divergence is a broad family of distance measures between probability distributions , the @xmath41-divergence between @xmath39 and @xmath40 is large if @xmath26 is true and hence it can be used in order to decide if the candidate point @xmath42 in ( [ eq4b ] ) is a change point ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "taking into account that the m.l.e . @xmath33 and @xmath36 of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively ,",
    "depend on the candidate change point @xmath42 , we will adopt the following notation for the @xmath41-divergence between @xmath39 and @xmath40 ,    @xmath46    provided that the convex function @xmath41 satisfies some additional conditions ( see page 408 in pardo ( 2006 ) ) which ensure the existence of the above integral .",
    "moreover , we consider convex functions @xmath41 which satisfy @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "large values of @xmath49 support the existence of a change point and therefore large values of @xmath49 suggest rejection of the null hypothesis @xmath28 .",
    "hence @xmath49 can be used as a test statistic for testing the hypotheses ( [ e4 ] ) . then , motivated by the fact that large values of @xmath50 are in favor of @xmath26 , a test for testing the existence of a single change point , that is the hypotheses ( [ e4 ] ) , should be based on the @xmath51-divergence test statistic , @xmath52 where@xmath53 moreover , the unknown position of the change point @xmath25 is estimated by @xmath54 such that@xmath55    based on the above discussion , @xmath56 in ( [ e4 ] ) is rejected for @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a constant to be determined by the null distribution of @xmath59 .",
    "hence , in order to use @xmath59 of ( [ e6 ] ) for testing hypotheses ( [ e4 ] ) , it is necessary the knowledge of the distribution of @xmath59 , under @xmath28 .",
    "there are two important reasons why working directly with test - statistics @xmath59 , defined in ( [ e6 ] ) , is avoided , on one hand , its asymptotic distribution @xmath60 , is not an easy to handle random variable ( see for instance theorem 1.2 and 1.3 in gombay and horvth ( 1989 ) ) and on the other hand , in practice cases such that @xmath61 are very difficult to detect . let @xmath62 be the set all possible integers @xmath32 such that @xmath63 $ ] , with @xmath64 , small enough",
    ". we shall modify ( [ e6 ] ) to be maximized in @xmath62 , i.e.@xmath65 and in the same manner ( [ e8 ] ) becomes@xmath66",
    "in order to get the asymptotic distribution of the family of tests statistics @xmath59 , given in ( [ e6 ] ) , we shall assume the usual regularity assumptions for the multiparameter central limit theorem ( see for instance theorem 5.2.2 . in sen and singer ( 1993 ) ) :    ( i ) : :    the parameter space , @xmath67 , is either    @xmath68 or a rectangle in @xmath68 .",
    "( ii ) : :    for all    @xmath69,@xmath70 ( iii ) : :    for    @xmath71,@xmath72    exist almost everywhere and are such    that@xmath73    where@xmath74 ( iv ) : :    denoting @xmath75,@xmath76    exist almost everywhere and are such that the fisher information    matrix is finite and positive definite .",
    "in addition ,    @xmath77    where@xmath78   , \\ ] ]    with    @xmath79    and @xmath80 is the euclidean norm .    under @xmath28 in ( [ e4 ] ) and the previous regularity assumptions , ( i)-(iv ) , the asymptotic distribution of ( [ e10 ] ) is given by@xmath81 where @xmath82,@xmath83}\\frac { 1}{t(1-t)}\\left\\vert \\boldsymbol{w}_{0}^{(m)}(t)\\right\\vert ^{2 } , \\label{e10b}\\ ] ] with @xmath84}$ ] ,  being an @xmath85-dimensional vector of independent brownian bridges  and @xmath86 .    according to the properties of the mles we know that@xmath87 where for @xmath88 , such that @xmath89 , @xmath90   \\right )   _ { i , j\\in \\{1, ... ,m\\}}$ ] , is the information matrix . if we consider that @xmath91 , then@xmath92 this means that under @xmath93 , i.e. @xmath94 , @xmath95 and hence we can construct a wald - type test - statistic as follows@xmath96 where @xmath97 is any consistent estimator of @xmath98 . from theorem 1 in hawkins ( 1987 ) we know that@xmath99 in addition from pardo ( 2006 ) , page 443 , we have@xmath100 where@xmath101 with both results we conclude ( [ e9 ] ) .    if we compare ( [ eq ] ) with formula ( 2.3 ) in hawkins ( 1987 ) , both apparently are not equivalent because in our case @xmath102 appears rather than @xmath103 of formula ( 2.3 ) .",
    "this difference is associated with the way of understanding fisher information matrix , in fact our wald test - statistic coincide with the empirical stochastic process denoted by @xmath104  at the beginning of section 3 in hawkins ( 1987 ) .",
    "the probability distribution function of random variable @xmath105 , for @xmath64 , given in ( [ e10b ] ) , can be found in sen ( 1981 , page 397 ) and de long ( 1981 ) .",
    "the computation of the probability distribution function is complex , however it is possible to approximate the @xmath106-value of the test in which the distribution of @xmath105 is considered under the null hypothesis . in estrella ( 2003 ) , for instance,@xmath107 with @xmath108  being the gamma function , is proposed as an approximation of@xmath109 when calibrating the approximation for the univariate parameter ( @xmath110 ) , we can take into account that the exact quantiles of order @xmath111 for @xmath112 , are @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115  respectively , i.e. @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "if we use ( [ eqaprox ] ) with @xmath112 and the aforementioned quantiles , we obtain @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "we can see that in particular , @xmath122 approximates very well @xmath123 when @xmath124 is the quantile of order @xmath125 , which is in practice of major interest .",
    "in this section we are going to focus on the change point analysis for a particular discrete probability model , the binomial model . for this special case we will give an explicit expression for divergence based test - statistics .",
    "the accuracy will be compared by simulation with respect to pre - existing test - statistics . in this context , suppose we are dealing with a sequence of independent r.v.s @xmath126 , @xmath6 , for which we are interested in testing ( [ e1 ] ) . in order to do that we are going to consider a sequence of independent bernoulli r.v.s @xmath127 , @xmath6 , @xmath128 , whose probability mass function ( p.m.f . ) is given by @xmath129 ,  @xmath130 , and @xmath131 ,  @xmath132 . if we denote the cumulative steps between consecutive binomial r.v.s by @xmath133 the change points are located at @xmath134 for @xmath135 and at @xmath136  for @xmath137 .",
    "hence , @xmath135 is the only sequence of r.v.s which are strictly identically distributed , but the change points of interest are located in @xmath138 .",
    "this means that we can construct the test - statistic by considering a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "r.v.s but in addition we restrict the set of possible change points to @xmath136 , rather than one step change points .",
    "when the change point is located at @xmath139 , the mles of @xmath44 and @xmath45  are given by@xmath140    the likelihood ratio test - statistic is given by @xmath141 , where@xmath142 \\label{lrt}\\ ] ] two important papers which cover @xmath143 are worsley ( 1983 ) , and horvth ( 1989 ) .",
    "the expression they gave for @xmath144 is not exactly the same , but it is equivalent to ( [ lrt ] ) ( see formula ( 3.22 ) in horvth and serbinowska ( 1995 ) ) .",
    "horvth ( 1989 ) found that the asymptotic distribution for a kind of normalization of @xmath143 based on the darling - erds formula@xmath145 is asymptotically equal to a extreme value random variable with parameters @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "in addition , in theorem 1.2 of horvth and serbinowska ( 1995 ) , a modified version of the likelihood ratio test - statistic was given , @xmath148 , where@xmath149 the asymptotic distribution of @xmath150 is the supremum in @xmath151 of a standard univariate brownian bridge ( its probability distribution function is tabulated in kiefer ( 1959 ) ) .",
    "we consider the version of the wald test - statistic @xmath152 , with@xmath153 where the consistent estimator of @xmath98 is given by@xmath154 finally , in order to give an explicit expression for divergence based test - statistics we are going to focus on a family of divergences , power divergences ( see read and cressie ( 1988 ) ) , for which @xmath155 , if @xmath156 and @xmath157 , if @xmath158 , that is for each @xmath159 we obtain a different divergence measure between the p.m.f.s @xmath160 and @xmath161,@xmath162 when @xmath163 the power divergence coincides with the so called kullback divergence@xmath164 and when @xmath165 the power divergence coincides with the modified kullback divergence @xmath166 .",
    "hence , the shape of the power - divergence based test - statistics is @xmath167@xmath168 , where@xmath169 that is@xmath170 and@xmath171 assuming that there is a monotone , continuous function @xmath172 such that @xmath173 and@xmath174 the asymptotic distribution of @xmath175 and @xmath176 , for all @xmath159 , is the supremum in @xmath177 $ ] of the univariate tied - down bessel process , i.e. ( [ e10b ] ) with @xmath110 .",
    "this assumption is very similar to the assumption given in horvth and serbinowska ( 1995 ) for the asymptotic distribution of @xmath150 .",
