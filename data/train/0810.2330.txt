    "observation of a bound state of the @xmath1 meson and atomic nucleus would be very interesting for studies of the @xmath5 interaction and for investigation of @xmath6 properties in nuclear matter .",
    "existence of such states was postulated by haider and liu  @xcite , however , up to now no firm experimental evidence for eta - mesic matter was found .",
    "encouraged by the recent data from mami showing some indications for photoproduction of @xmath7 bound state@xcite , we performed a search for this state in the @xmath8 collisions .",
    "the measurements reported here were carried out with the cosy-11 detector  @xcite using a slowly ramped internal deuteron beam of the cosy accelerator  @xcite scattered on a proton target  @xcite .",
    "the momentum of the deuteron beam was varied continuously within each acceleration cycle from 3.095  gev / c to 3.180  gev / c , crossing the kinematical threshold for the @xmath1 production in the @xmath2 reaction at 3.141  gev / c  @xcite .",
    "a signature of existence of the @xmath9 bound state would be an observation of a resonance - like structure with the center lying below the @xmath1 production threshold in excitation curves for chosen decay channels .",
    "as decay modes we registered @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 channel .",
    "+ we measured also the total and differential cross sections for the @xmath1 production in the @xmath2 reaction . the cross sections from our measurements@xcite and from similar measurements of the anke collaboration@xcite indicate a presence of a bound or virtual state in the @xmath9 system@xcite . in turns ,",
    "the excitation function for the @xmath13 process registered in the present experiment does not show any structure which could originate from the decay of @xmath9 bound state@xcite . however , this does not exclude existence of such state since its signal can lie below the sensitivity of the present experiment due to small production cross section and/or due to low probability of decay in the registered @xmath10 channel@xcite .",
    "we expect that @xmath11 can be a much more favorable decay channel since it is produced in a one step process via absorption of the @xmath1 meson on the neutron inside the @xmath3 nucleus leading to the creation of the @xmath14 pair in the reaction @xmath15 . in the @xmath16 center - of - mass frame ,",
    "the pion and the proton are emitted back - to - back with momenta of about 431  mev / c . in the reaction center - of - mass system these momenta",
    "are smeared due to the fermi motion of the neutron inside the @xmath3 nucleus .",
    "however , they are significantly larger than the momenta of the two remaining protons in the @xmath3 nucleus which play a role of `` spectators '' moving with the fermi momenta which are in the order of 100  mev / c . in the next chapter we present recent results of analysis of the @xmath0 data collected in our experiment .",
    "the protons originating from the @xmath0 reaction were momentum analyzed in the cosy-11 dipole magnet and their trajectories were registered with a pair of drift chambers .",
    "a detailed description of the detection system can be found e.g. in articles  @xcite .",
    "the experimental trigger required at least three charged tracks in the scintillation hodoscope s1 standing in a distance of about 3  m from the target , and additionally at least two tracks in the hodoscope s3 placed 9  m behind s1 . the momentum acceptance defined by the s1-s3 pair covered the momenta expected for the spectator protons .",
    "the time of flight measured between s1 and s3 combined with the momentum measurement was used for identification of the outgoing protons ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . for identification of protons registered in the s1 but",
    "not reaching the s3 hodoscope , the time of flight between the target and s1 was used .",
    "the pions were identified using the missing mass method ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    4.0 cm    4.0 cm    left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows distribution of the transversal vs. longitudinal momentum components of registered protons from the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "this distribution is dominated by events of quasi - free @xmath17 production in the process @xmath18 where the neutron projectiles originate from the deuteron beam .",
    "the corresponding spectator protons from the deuteron beam are visible as a group of counts on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig3](left ) . in the further analysis we rejected the quasi - free @xmath17 production by setting an upper limit for the longitudinal proton momenta equal to 0.18  gev / c in the c.m .",
    "system , represented by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig3](left ) .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath17 momenta determined after application of this cut is centered at the value of about 430  mev / c ( see middle panel of fig .  [ fig3 ] ) as expected for pions originating from decay of the @xmath19(1535 ) . also the distribution of the c.m .",
    "angles between the pion momentum vector and the momentum vector of the proton with the highest absolute value of the c.m .",
    "momentum indicates for such decay since the angles are close to @xmath20(right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the counting rate of all identified @xmath21 events including the quasi - free @xmath17 production remains constant in the scanned range of the beam momentum ( see fig .  [",
    "however , after rejection of the quasi - free events , the number of @xmath21 counts in the beam momentum interval above the @xmath1 threshold is higher than the number of counts in the beam momentum interval of equal width below the threshold ( see fig .  [ fig6]b ) .",
    "this difference is equal to @xmath22 and its statistical significance is of @xmath23 .",
    "this difference only slightly decreases to the value of @xmath24 after application of an additional requirement that two out of the three outgoing protons have the c.m .",
    "momenta smaller than 200  mev / c as expected with high probability for the spectator protons ( see fig .  [ fig6]c ) . as a possible reaction mechanism explaining the observed excitation function we consider production of the @xmath1 meson in the reaction @xmath2 which subsequently convert to @xmath17 in the interaction with the neutron in the @xmath3 nucleus in the process @xmath15 .",
