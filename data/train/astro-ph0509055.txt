    "the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogren presents a unique probe of the evolution of the neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and cosmic reionization .",
    "furlanetto & briggs @xcite point out some of the advantages of using the hi line in this regard : ( i ) unlike ly@xmath0 ( ie .",
    "the gunn - peterson effect ) , the 21 cm line does not saturate , and the igm remains translucent at large neutral fractions @xcite .",
    "and ( ii ) unlike cmb polarization studies , the hi line provides full three dimensional ( 3d ) information on the evolution of cosmic structure , and the technique involves imaging the neutral igm directly , and hence can easily discern different reionization models @xcite .",
    "hi 21 cm observations can be used to study evolution of cosmic structure from the linear regime at high redshift ( ie . density - only evolution ) , through the non - linear , messy astrophysics regime associated with luminous source formation . as such , hi measurements are sensitive to structures ranging from very large scales down to the source scale set by the cosmological jeans mass , thereby `` making 21 cm the richest of all cosmological data sets '' @xcite .",
    "early calculations of hi 21 cm signal from a neutral igm discuss a broad range of models for large scale hi structure , including zeldovich pancakes arising in hdm models , explosive structure formation models , and cdm @xcite .",
    "early ( unsuccessful ) searches for large scale structure in hi based on this wide range of predictions include searches for pancakes with masses @xmath1 m@xmath2 at @xmath3 @xcite , and for even more massive structures ( @xmath4 m@xmath2 ) at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the cosmological parameter space has been greatly reduced due to the advent of the concordance model of @xmath6cdm structure formation , and this paper will assume the standard precision cosmology parameters @xcite .    in this review i will summarize the hi 21 cm probes of cosmic reionization and the neutral igm .",
    "i will focus on the latest predictions for the expected signals , and the observational capabilities of telescopes being built , or planned , to detect these signals .",
    "i begin with a short basic review of the physical processes involved in reionization that relate directly to the hi 21 cm signal .",
    "previous reviews that dealt with , at least in part , the hi 21 cm signal from cosmic reionization , include @xcite , and in the context of the square kilometer array ( ska ) @xcite .",
    "see also articles by furlanetto , morales , and peterson in this volume .",
    "the physics and equations of radiative transfer of the hi 21 cm line through the neutral igm have been considered in detail by many authors @xcite , and i review only the basic results here .    in analogy to the gunn - peterson effect for ly@xmath0 absorption by the neutral igm ,",
    "the optical depth , @xmath7 , of the neutral hydrogen to 21 cm absorption for our adopted values of the cosmological parameters is : @xmath8 this equation shows immediately the rich physics involved in studying the hi 21 cm line during reionization , with @xmath7 depending on the evolution of cosmic over - densities , @xmath9 ( predominantly in the linear regime ) , the neutral fraction , @xmath10 ( ie .",
    "reionization ) , and the hi excitation , or spin , temperature , @xmath11 .    in the raleigh - jeans limit , the observed brightness temperature ( relative to the cmb ) due to the hi 21 cm line at a frequency @xmath12 , where @xmath13 mhz ,",
    "is given by : @xmath14 the conversion factor from brightness temperature to specific intensity , i@xmath15 , is given by : @xmath16 , or in more common units : @xmath17 jy sr@xmath18 .",
    "equation 2 shows that for @xmath19 one expects no 21 cm signal . when @xmath20 , the brightness temperature becomes independent of spin temperature .",
    "when @xmath21 , we expect a strong negative ( ie .",
    "absorption ) signal against the cmb .",
    "an important point to keep in mind is that , for the 21 cm experiments being considered , the signal being observed corresponds to large scale structure , not individual galaxies .",
    "this point is demonstrated in fig 1 , which shows the expected signal in jy versus redshift for different hi masses , along with the expected sensitivity of current and future radio telescopes . for simplicity ,",
    "i have assumed a single line width of 300 km s@xmath18 , which would correspond to individual virialized galaxies , or to large scale structures just separating from the hubble flow .",
    "fig 1 shows that current instruments , such as the gmrt , can detect large galaxies ( @xmath22 m@xmath2 in gas ) out to only modest redshifts ( @xmath23 ) , even in long integration times . at redshifts corresponding to reionization ( @xmath24 ) , future large area low frequency radio telescopes , such as lofar , and eventually the ska ,",
    "will still be limited to studying large scale structure ( hi masses @xmath25 to 10@xmath26 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "fortunately , the entire igm is made up of neutral hydrogen prior to reionization , and the large scale structure detected is not just density enhancements ( ie .",
    "protoclusters ) , but also structure induced by reionization itself ( the bubble machine of hii regions ) , and possibly spatial variations in the spin temperature .",
    "@xcite show that the hi excitation temperature will equilibrate with the cmb on a timescale @xmath27 year , in absence of other effects .",
    "however , collisions and resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons can drive @xmath11 to the gas kinetic temperature , @xmath28 @xcite : @xmath29 in this equation , @xmath30 represents collisional excitation of the hyperfine transition , which couples @xmath11 to the gas kinetic temperature @xmath28 .",
    "the coupling coefficient @xmath31 , and @xcite shows that , for the mean igm density , collisional coupling between @xmath11 and @xmath28 becomes significant for @xmath32 .",
    "the third term in equ 3 corresponds to the wouthuysen - field effect , in which resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons couples the spin temperature to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that this latter mechanism will be important when the radiation background at the ly@xmath0 frequency satisfies @xmath33 erg @xmath34 s@xmath18 hz@xmath18 sr@xmath18 , or about one ly@xmath0 photon per every two baryons at @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the cmb temperature , the kinetic temperature , and the spin temperature , coupled with radiative transfer , lead to a number of interesting physical regimes for the hi 21 cm signal .",
    "@xcite suggest the following plausible regimes :    at @xmath36 residual free electrons couple @xmath37 and @xmath28 through thompson scattering and subsequent gas collisions , while the density is high enough to equilibrate @xmath28 and @xmath11 . in this case",
    "@xmath38 and there is no 21 cm signal .    at @xmath39",
    "to 200 , the residual ionization fraction and density is too low to couple @xmath28 to @xmath37 , so the gas cools adiabatically , with temperature falling as @xmath40 , ie .",
    "faster than the ( 1+z ) for the cmb . hence the gas becomes colder than the cmb .",
    "however , the mean density in this redshift range is still high enough to provide some coupling between @xmath11 and @xmath28 through collisions , and the hi 21 cm signal might be seen in absorption against the cmb . in this regime the hi fluctuations are still evolving linearly , essentially following the dark matter @xcite .    at @xmath41 to 30 , the situation starts to become complex .",
    "collisions can no longer couple @xmath28 to @xmath11 , and @xmath11 again approaches @xmath37 .",
    "however , we might also expect the first luminous structures ( pop iii stars or mini - quasars ) , at least near the end of this redshift range .",
    "the ly@xmath0 photons from these objects would induce local coupling of @xmath28 and @xmath11 , thereby leading to some 21 cm absorption regions . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite point out that these same photons , and more importantly , any xrays from the first luminous sources @xcite , could lead to local igm warming above @xmath37 well before reionization .",
    "energetically it takes 13.6 ev per baryon to ionize the igm , but only @xmath42 ev to warm the igm about @xmath37 .",
    "hence one might expect a patch work of regions with no signal , absorption , and perhaps emission , in the 21 cm line .    at @xmath43 to 20",
    "all the physical processes come to play .",
    "the igm is being warmed by the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons @xcite , and penetrating , ionizing hard xrays , from the first galaxies and black holes @xcite , as well as by weak shocks associated with structure formation @xcite , such that @xmath28 is likely larger than @xmath37 globally @xcite .",
    "likewise , these objects are reionizing the universe , leading to a fundamental topological change in the igm , from the linear evolution of large scale structure , to a bubble dominated era of hii regions @xcite .",
    "it is this regime that most ( although not all ) , theoretical work has been exploring , and the expected hi 21 cm signal is rich .",
    "finally , after reionization , @xmath44 to 10 , the igm is fully ionized ( @xmath45 ) , and the 21 cm signal is gone .",
    "in an idealized sense , if the universe reionized very rapidly everywhere , at the same time , one would expect a global ( ie .",
    "full sky ) step in the background temperature at the frequency corresponding to the redshifted 21 cm line @xcite .",
    "however , if nothing else , cosmic variance will lead to different ionization redshifts in different regions , and we now know that reionization is likely an extended process in time , thereby smoothing out the expected signal in space and time . on the other hand , since this is an all sky signal , the sensitivity of the experiment is independent of telescope collecting area , and the experiment can be done using small area telescopes at low frequency , with well controlled frequency response .",
    "-2.65 in    the most recent modeling of the expected global hi signal is presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who employ the numerical simulations of @xcite .",
    "they include both a fast reionization model , plus more complicated , _ ad hoc _ reionization histories .",
    "results from these calculations are reproduced in fig 2a .",
    "the expected signal peaks at roughly 20 mk above the foreground . in their fiducial ( fast reionization ) model ,",
    "the peak occurs at @xmath46 .",
    "they also predict a negative signal , meaning absorption against the cmb , at higher redshift , prior to igm warming , but allowing for ly@xmath0 resonant scattering ( ie . the era of ly@xmath0 coupling @xcite ) .",
    "the shaded region shows the potential system thermal noise of a well calibrated low frequency experiment .",
    "@xcite point out that detecting this signal against the mean non - thermal foreground radiation may be difficult .",
    "the foreground is the sum of relatively smooth galactic synchrotron emission and discrete distant radio galaxies , with a typical spectral index , @xmath47 , where @xmath0 is defined as : @xmath48 .",
    "the foreground temperature behaves roughly as @xmath49 , in the coldest regions of the sky , and can be an order of magnitude higher in the galactic plane . hence , the expect change in @xmath50 is at most @xmath51 that of the mean foreground signal over the frequency range @xmath52 to 200 mhz .",
    "the majority of theoretical studies have focused on predicting the hi fluctuations in the igm on scales of arcmins to a few degrees both during @xcite , and prior to @xcite , reionization .",
    "most studies have focused on the diffuse igm , although a few studies have also considered the signal expected due to the clustering of collapsed structures @xcite .    the hi 21 cm signal from the igm during reionization can be predicted both analytically , using a standard press - schechter type of analysis of linear structure formation , plus some recipes to approximate non - linear evolution @xcite , or through the use of numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "fig 3 shows the expected evolution of the hi 21 cm signal during reionization based on the numerical simulations of @xcite .",
    "they find that the mean hi signal is about @xmath53 mk prior to reionization , with fluctuations of only a few mk on arcmin scales due to linear density evolution . in this simulation ,",
    "the hii regions caused by galaxy formation during reionization are seen in the redshift range @xmath54 to 10 , reaching scales up to 2@xmath55 ( frequency widths @xmath56 mhz @xmath57 mpc physical size ) .",
    "these regions have ( negative ) brightness temperatures up to 20 mk relative to the mean hi signal .",
    "this corresponds to 5@xmath58jy beam@xmath18 in a 2@xmath55 beam at 140 mhz .",
    "we compare this signal to the sensitivity of a radio array .",
    "the point source rms sensitivity ( dual polarization ) in an image from a synthesis radio telescope is given by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the channel width in khz , @xmath61 is the integration time in hours , @xmath62 is the total system temperature , @xmath63 is the collecting area of each element in the array , @xmath64 is the aperture efficiency , and @xmath65 is the number of elements ( @xmath66 = total effective collecting area of the array ) . at low frequency the value of @xmath62 is dominated by the non - thermal foreground , and again behaves as @xmath67 k. the beam fwhm is given by the fourier transform of the uv coverage , assuming equal weight for each visibility .",
    "consider an array with an effective collecting area of 1 square kilometer at 140 mhz , distributed over 4 km , a system temperature of 300 k , a channel width of 0.3 mhz , and integrating for one month .",
    "the rms sensitivity is then 1.3@xmath58jy beam@xmath18 , with a beam fwhm @xmath68 .",
    "this square kilometer array will be just adequate to perform true three dimensional imaging of the average structure of the igm during reionization .",
    "unfortunately , the nearer term low frequency path finder arrays will have @xmath69 the collecting of the ska , and will likely not be able to perform such direct 3d imaging ( table 1 ) .",
    "however , these near term experiments should have enough sensitivity to perform power spectral analyses of the hi 21 cm fluctuations .",
    "for power spectral analyses the sensitivity is greatly enhanced relative to direct imaging due to the fact that the universe is isotropic , and hence one can average the measurements in annuli in the uv - plane , ie .",
    "the statistics of fluctuations along a uv annulus are equivalent .",
    "the width of independent uv annuli is set by the primary beam diameter , d , or @xmath70 .",
    "the situation is analogous to cobe and wmap .",
    "cobe lacked the sensitivity to make a true image of the cmb fluctuations , but was able to make a robust determination of the power spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "wmap was able to produce a proper image of the cmb .",
    "many authors have considered the power spectrum of brightness temperature fluctuations in the hi 21 cm line @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the noise power spectrum , in mk@xmath71 , in standard spherical harmonic units , @xmath72 , for an array with uniform coverage of the uv plane , is given by :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 = areal covering factor of the array @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the total area of the area defined by the longest baseline .",
    "for example , for the logarithmic antenna spacing of the vla in the smallest configuration , the vla - vhf system has @xmath77 on baselines out to 1 km , and @xmath78 out to 0.25 km , for a full synthesis observation . for comparison",
    ", the ska will have 30@xmath79 of it s collecting area inside 1 km , or @xmath80 out to 1 km .",

    "fig 4 includes the power spectrum arising from linear density fluctuations following the dark matter , plus the effect of reionization .",
    "the signature of reionization can be seen as a bump in the power spectrum above the density - only curve due to the formation of hii regions . in this calculation , the rms fluctuations at @xmath83 peak at about 10 mk rms ( observing frequency = 130 mhz ) on scales @xmath84 , or @xmath85 , or baselines , @xmath86 km , or wavenumber @xmath87 ( comoving ) . ] .",

    "also , clustering of luminous sources ( ie .",
    "biased galaxy formation ) implies a characteristic scale for the hii regions of 1 to 10 mpc ( comoving ) , and leads to another factor two in fluctuation strength @xcite over the random distribution of hii regions assumed by @xcite .",

    "they point out that hi 21 cm power spectral studies should provide powerful constraints on the process of reionization , with different reionization scenarios clearly discernable in their power spectral signature .",
    "note that this is unlike cmb large scale polarization measurements , which provide reasonable constraints on the total thompson scattering optical depth through the universe back to recombination , but only marginal constraints on the reionization history @xcite .",

    "this foreground includes discrete radio galaxies , and large scale emission from our own galaxy . the expected hi signal is about @xmath129 of the foreground emission .",
    "many groups have considered the effects of the foregrounds on hi 21 cm eor imaging and power spectral studies .",
    "@xcite show that , even if point sources can be removed to the level of 1 @xmath58jy , the rms fluctutions on spatial scales @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) due to residual radio point sources will be @xmath132 mk just do to poisson noise , increasing by a factor 100 if the sources are strongly clustered .",
    "clearly this conclusion depends on the extrapolation of radio source populations to @xmath133jy , but under reasonable assumptions , even in the poisson case the residual source fluctuations will be comparable to the hi signal .    this calculation has led many groups to consider removal of foregrounds in the spectral domain .",
    "the important point is that the foregrounds should be relatively smooth in frequency , predominantly the sum of power - law , low frequency non - thermal spectra , or perhaps gently curving on spectral scales @xmath132 s mhz .",
    "the hi signal should show significant structure on sub - mhz scales , corresponding to the typical size scale for features during reionization .",
    "a number of complimentary approaches have been presented for foreground removal .",
    "@xcite consider removal of the foregrounds through fitting of smooth spectral models ( power laws or low order polynomials in log space ) to the observed visibilities or images .",
    "@xcite present a 3d fourier analysis of the measured visibilities , where the third dimension is frequency .",
    "they show that the different symmetries in this 3d space for the signal arising from the noise - like hi emission , versus the smooth ( in frequency ) foreground emission , can be a powerful means of differentiating between foreground emission and the eor line signal .",
    "@xcite perform a similar analysis , only in the complementary fourier space , meaning cross correlation of spectral channels .",
    "they show that the 21 cm signal will effectively decorrelate for channel separations @xmath134 mhz , while the foregrounds do not , and this too can be a means of separating the foregrounds from the desired 21 cm fluctuations .",
    "the overall conclusion of these methods is that spectral decomposition should be adequate to separate non - thermal foregrounds from the hi 21 cm signal from reionization at the mk level .    however , there are two potentially more insideous observational challenges relating to non - thermal foregrounds beyond simple in - beam confusion",
    ". first , there can be frequency dependent sidelobes from confusing sources in the very wide fields being considered .",
    "a particularly problematic effect has been the recent observation that telescope spectral response ( ie .",
    "bandpass ) may depend on position of a given source in the primary beam @xcite .",
    "the origin of this effect remains uncertain ( perhaps relating to scattering and blocking structures ) , but it will lead to frequency dependent sidelobes that potentially affect widefields and are not removed through normal ( on - axis ) bandpass calibration , and may require a spatially dependent bandpass calibration .    and second is polarized structure in the diffuse emission in the field . wide field polarization has been seen with low frequency observations with the wsrt at 330 mhz and below , and is thought to arise due to differential faraday depth through the ism @xcite . hence , great care is required to control , and calibrate , the wide field polarization response of the primary elements .",
    "a second potential challenge to low frequency imaging over wide fields is phase fluctuations caused by the ionosphere .",
    "these fluctuations are due to index of refraction fluctuations in the ionized plasma , and behave as @xmath135 .",
    "morever , the typical isoplanatic patch , or angle over which a single phase error applies , is a few to 10 degrees ( physical scales of 10 s km in the ionosphere ) , depending on frequency @xcite .",
    "fields larger than the isoplanatic patch will have multiple phase errors across the field , and hence can not be corrected through standard ( ie .",
    "single solution ) phase self - calibration techniques .",
    "new wide field self - calibration techniques , involving multiple phase solutions over the field , or a rubber screen phase model @xcite , are being developed that should allow for self - calibration over wide fields .",
    "however , even self - calibration techniques will be insufficient to overcome the very rapid variations caused by the occasional ionospheric storm , or traveling ionospheric disturbances .    at very low frequency ( @xmath90 a few mhz ) , one approaches the plasma frequency of the ionosphere , and the optical depth increases dramatically , precluding observations from the ground .",
    "perhaps the most difficult problem facing low frequency radio astronomy is terrestrial ( man - made ) interference .",
    "the relevant frequency range corresponds to 7 to 200 mhz ( @xmath136 to 6 ) .",
    "these are not protected frequency bands , and commercial allocations include everything from broadcast radio and television , to fixed and mobile communications .",
    "many groups are pursuing methods for rfi mitigation and excision ( see extensive references at @xcite ) .",
    "these include : ( i ) using a reference horn , or one beam of a phased array , for constant monitoring of known , strong , rfi signals , ( ii ) conversely , arranging interferometric phases to produce a null at the position of the rfi source , and ( iii ) real - time rfi excision using advanced filtering techniques in time and frequency , of digitized signals both pre- and post - correlation .",
    "this requires very high dynamic range ( many bit sampling ) , and very high frequency resolution .",
    "one obvious advantage of hi absorption experiments ( section 3.3 ) is that they can be done using long baselines ( 10 s to 100 s of km ) .",
    "long baselines lead to decorrelation of the terrestrial signal due to fringe tracking of the celestial source .",
    "however , the fringe rates on the short baselines required for the hi emission experiments ( @xmath90 few km ) are low , such that decorrelation due to fringe winding will not be a very effective rfi filter on the shorter baseline .    in the end ,",
    "the most effective means of reducing interference is to go to the remotest sites .",
    "@xcite have selected sites in remote regions of western australia , and china , respectively , because of known low rfi environments . of course",
    ", the ultimate location would be the back side of the moon .",
    "many programs have been initiated to study the hi 21 cm signal from cosmic reionization , and beyond .",
    "these are summarized in table 1 .",
    "a number of different approaches are being taken , both techinically and in order to address different aspects of the problem @xcite .",
    "the largest near - term efforts are the mileura wide field array ( mwa ) , the primeval structure telescope ( past ) , and the low frequency array ( lofar ) .",
    "these are being optimized to study the power spectrum of the hi 21 cm fluctuations , although in principle they will be able to image the larger hii regions during reionization .",
    "the vla - vhf system is designed specifically to set limits on the hii regions around @xmath137 to 6.4 sdss qsos , although it should also constrain the late - time power spectrum . in the long term",
    "the square kilometer array should have the sensitivity to perform true three dimensional imaging of the neutral igm in the 21 cm line during reionization . and at the lowest frequencies ( @xmath138 mhz ) , the long wavelength array ( lwa ) , and eventually the lunar array ( ludar @xcite ) , are being designed for the higher @xmath139 signal , prior to reionization .    as discussed above ,",
    "the technical challenges are many .",
    "use of spectral decomposition to remove the foregrounds requires careful control of the synthesize beam as a function of frequency , with the optimal ( although difficult ) solution being a telescope design where the synthesized beam is invariant as a function of frequency @xcite .",
    "high dynamic range front ends are required to avoid saturation in cases of strong interference , while fine spectral sampling is required to avoid gibbs ringing in the spectral response .",
    "the polarization response must be stable and well calibrated .",
    "calibation in the presence of a significant ionospheric phase screen requires new wide field calibration techniques .",
    "the very high data rate expected for many element ( @xmath140 ) arrays requires new methods for data transmission , cross correlation , and storage @xcite . at the lowest frequencies , @xmath141mhz or so , where we hope to study the pre - reionization igm , phase fluctuations and the opacity of the ionosphere becomes problematic , leading to the proposed ludar project on the far side of the moon .",
    "the far side of the moon is also the best location in order to completely avoid terrestrial interference .",
