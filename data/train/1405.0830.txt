    "magnetic compounds with a low magnetic anisotropy are interesting for the large variety of magnetic phases they display . in general , the starting point to understand these magnetic phases are interacting heisenberg spins defined on lattices that mimic the lattice structure of the actual compounds . while examining quantum heisenberg spins remains a challenging task ,  @xcite in many cases , understanding the phase diagram for interacting classical heisenberg spins is also a complicated problem .",
    "@xcite actually , it has been proven that geometrical frustration combined with complex lattice structure can make such analysis highly non - trivial . in many cases various exotic magnetic ground states",
    "were identified , for example , for pyrochlore lattices  @xcite , diamond lattice ,  @xcite _ etc._. one of the key ingredients of geometrical frustration is the presence of triangles as structural units in a lattice .",
    "@xcite for this reason the study of antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin models on various triangular lattices , including one dimensional ladder , @xmath2d and @xmath3d triangular lattices , and quasi-@xmath2d triangular ladders , has drawn considerable attention in the scientific community .",
    "@xcite    one example of such lattice with geometrical frustration is the hollandite lattice ,  @xcite which is the crystal structure of some transition metal oxides as in the case of @xmath0-mno@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite this manganese oxide has recently attracted considerable attention from both experimental and theoretical condensed matter research communities  @xcite because of its large number of applications as a catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction  @xcite , microbial fuel cells  @xcite , electrode materials for li - ion batteries  @xcite , lithium - air batteries  @xcite and in supercapacitors  @xcite , _",
    "etc._. hollandite - type compounds display pores with a diameter of @xmath44.6  , ( see fig.[fig : mno2-lattice](a ) ) .",
    "these large channels can accommodate cations such as k@xmath5 , na@xmath5 , and ba@xmath6 , leading to non - stoichiometric compounds such as k@xmath7(h@xmath8o)@xmath9mn@xmath10o@xmath11  @xcite and ba@xmath12mn@xmath10o@xmath11 .",
    "@xcite the presence of these impurities makes it hard to determine their composition , in particular the water content .",
    "@xcite this uncertainty in the composition introduces a difficulty for studying the electronic and magnetic properties of these compounds , as they vary depending on the type of dopant and its concentration . the magnetic frustration due to the structural triangles ( see fig.[fig : mno2-lattice](b ) ) , and the presence of impurities in the channels are at the origin of the rich variety of magnetic ordered phases that have been identified experimentally in these materials .",
    "the best studied case is that of potassium impurities .",
    ".   reported an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition for k@xmath13mno@xmath1 at t@xmath14=@xmath15 k , also an afm ground state was reported for k@xmath16mno@xmath1 synthesized with a hydrothermal technique .",
    "@xcite however , the exact nature of this afm phase is still unknown .",
    "increasing the amount of k@xmath5 ions in the channels of k@xmath9mno@xmath1 ( @xmath17 ) a spin - glass behavior was observed at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite moreover , impurities can further complicate the phase diagram : the k@xmath7(h@xmath8o)@xmath9mn@xmath10o@xmath11 exhibits a ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition at @xmath18 k and this fm state persists down to @xmath19 k. when the temperature is further lowered , the ferromagnetic state disappears and possibly a helical magnetic state is established , as suggested by the spatial anisotropic behavior of the susceptibility .",
    "@xcite a helical magnetic structure was also suggested for k@xmath20mno@xmath1 at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite    recently some theoretical studies have been carried out  @xcite in order to understand the magnetic phase diagrams of the hollandite type magnetic compounds . in particular in ref .",
    "crespo and co - workers used a simple ising model to qualitatively reproduce both the antiferromagnetic ground state  @xcite in the absence of disorder and the spin - glass transition under doping .",
    "@xcite nevertheless this study was only a zeroth order approximation to this type of systems as manganese compounds are known to display low magnetic anisotropy .",
    "in fact experimental data for several manganese compounds  @xcite have shown that these compounds are well described by the heisenberg model .",
    "consequently , the model of ref .   can not reproduce realistic low temperature magnetic configurations of manganites , like non - collinear afm or helical magnetic ground states , that have been suggested in some compounds .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we extend the previous work  @xcite and study the classical heisenberg model on the hollandite lattice in order to investigate the ground state magnetic phase diagram as a function of the model parameters . by exploring all possible magnetic interactions between the spins we probe different uniform compositions of the hollandite structure and",
    "therefore give an explanation to some of the magnetic ground states that have been experimentally suggested .",
    "we have found that the hollandite lattice supports many different ground states inside the phase space of model parameters : from various collinear afm spin configurations , as in the ising case  @xcite for large values of the afm couplings , to incommensurate helical spin configurations when all the interactions have comparable strengths . to find the ground states for a given set of couplings two different approaches",
    "have been used : ( i ) the well - known interaction matrix analysis  @xcite and ( ii ) numerical simulations  @xcite employing local field quench method .",
    "@xcite both methods agreed perfectly and yielded identical ground state energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we introduce the model in sec.[sec : model ] and the ground states for different choices of the interaction parameter are discussed in sec.[sec : clean ] . in sec.[sec",

    "the hollandite structure is shown schematically in fig.[fig : mno2-lattice ] .",
    "the lattice can be described as a collection of connected planes where each plane is extended parallel to the @xmath26 plane and is interconnected to the other planes in @xmath22-direction . the conventional unit cell is composed by @xmath21 sites that have been numerated in clockwise direction in the upper left corner of fig.[fig : mno2-lattice](a ) where the @xmath26 projection of the lattice is shown . repetition of the unit cell in the @xmath22-direction creates a channel - like structure that together with its local triangular form are the main features of the lattice .",
    "the connectivity between nearest unit cells extended in @xmath22-directions is shown in fig.[fig : mno2-lattice](b ) .",
    "a given site of the hollandite lattice has @xmath21 nearest neighbors , that are shown in fig.[fig : mno2-lattice](c ) .",
    "we remark that in real materials , like the @xmath0-mno@xmath1 compounds , these @xmath21 neighbors are at different distances , the length of the bonds being @xmath42.86  , 2.91   and 3.44  , respectively .",
    "nevertheless these sites have to be considered as nearest neighbors since removing the longer links disrupts the lattice connectivity .",
    "the magnetism in @xmath0-mno@xmath1 materials is due to the interaction of the magnetic moments localized on manganese ions , which interact with each other through oxygen - mediated super - exchange .",
    "@xcite we consider here the simplest possible model compatible with the lattice structure and the low magnetic anisotropy of manganese ions on manganese oxides : we place classical heisenberg spins on the sites of the hollandite lattice .",
    "we restrict the interaction to nearest neighbors .",
    "in fact recent results , based on density functional theory show that the contribution of the second nearest - neighbors to the total energy of the system is negligible  @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider a model similar to the one of ref .   where three couplings strengths - @xmath27 , @xmath28 - were used for the spin - spin interactions , one for each of the three types of nearest neighbors",
    ". assignment of @xmath29 and @xmath28 is shown in fig.[fig : mno2-interactions ] .",
    "therefore the heisenberg hamiltonian reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 denotes three different groups of nearest neighbors of spin ` @xmath33 ' .",
    "we used three colors - @xmath34 blue , @xmath35 red and @xmath28 green - in all figures to represent each type of nearest neighbors .",
    "positive values of the couplings correspond to afm interactions , the negative values refer fm interactions",
    ". we remark that such choice of the couplings makes the interactions @xmath36-anisotropic in general .    )",
    "bonds for different kind of nearest neighbours .",
    "the blue lines extending in @xmath22-directions denote @xmath34 bonds .",
    "the red lines denote the @xmath35 bonds and the green links are the @xmath28 bonds .",
    "this figure also shows the definition of a @xmath34 chain and how the lattice sites @xmath37 inside this chains are labeled .",
    "finally it is shown that this lattice could also be described with 4-site unit cell , where the sites selected in this work are represented by blue points and the three lattice vectors @xmath38 for this representation are also given as pink arrows .",
    "the details of the lattice parameters are given in appendix[sec : int - mat ] . ]    despite the seeming simplicity of the hamiltonian  , as we find below , it admits many different ordered magnetic ground states depending on signs and relative strengths of the couplings @xmath39 .",
    "this richness reflects the complicated geometry of the hollandite lattice and the frustration present for some values of the @xmath39 couplings . since in hollandite - type structures",
    "the angles of mn - o - mn bridges take values between @xmath40 and @xmath41 degrees , simple symmetry rules that determine the sign of the magnetic couplings , such as the goodenough - kanamori rules ,  @xcite can not be applied .",
    "we failed to find any experimental insights for the selection of particular values of the couplings @xmath39 .",
    "in general , we expect a different set of couplings for each material .",
    "therefore , in this study , we describe the possible magnetic ground states of the hamiltonian   for all possible values of the coupling strengths @xmath39 .",
    "this also provides us useful insights regarding the details of the couplings ( sign and the value ) that a particular compound may have .",
    "in this section we present the ground states of the hamiltonian  , assuming that all the couplings @xmath39 are constant and do not vary in space and we chart out the phase diagram for all possible combinations of signs and relative strengths of the couplings .",
    "the phase diagram depends crucially on the sign of the coupling @xmath34 .",
    "since the hollandite lattice is composed of triangular ladders ( see fig.[fig : mno2-interactions ] ) , the sign of @xmath34 determines whether the ladders are frustrated ( the case of @xmath42 ) or not ( the case of @xmath43 ) .",
    "this observation allows us to study the two cases separately and plot the phase diagram as a function of the ratios @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the case @xmath46 renders the spin - spin interactions unfrustrated , so that only simple fm or afm ground states are present , depending on the sign of @xmath35 and @xmath28 .",
    "such phase diagram is similar to that of the ising spins .",
    "@xcite     in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "( a ) projection of the first 6 spins on the @xmath26 plane where the non - commensurate nature of the ground state have been shown for an angle of @xmath47 .",
    "( b ) propagation of the helical spin configuration in the @xmath22-direction along the two neighboring @xmath34-chains . ]",
    "our results are summarized in fig.[fig : pd - j1-f ] which shows the case @xmath48 . for large values of the ratios @xmath44 and @xmath45 we find the same afm ground states as in the ising case  @xcite . for smaller values of the ratios we find coplanar helical phases , that are , in general , incommensurate with the lattice . for @xmath46",
    "the helical phases are absent and there are only the simpler afm ground states , this implies that frustration is needed for the appearance of the helical phases .",
    "the large ratio ground states are relatively easy to identify and we focus on the helical states below .    .",
    "the region inside the red line correspond to the four co - planar helical spin ground states configuration found in this work , c - h , c2-h , a2-h and f - h ( see text and fig.[fig : xzhelical ] ) .",
    "the corner region of each quarter ( large values of the couplings ) refer to the ordered phases c - afm , c2-afm , a2-afm and fm configurations . ]",
    "we used two different approaches to find the ground states and compute their energy .",
    "first , we performed the well - known interaction matrix analysis  @xcite that is briefly presented in appendix[sec : int - mat ] .",
    "second , we used numerical minimization which employs local field quench method .",
    "@xcite this method consists in starting from some , possibly random , initial configuration and minimizing the energy of the system by iteratively aligning every spin with its local field .",
    "this simple algorithm has proved its efficiency in the case of clean ( without disorder ) systems even in presence of frustration .",
    "@xcite we have found that the lowest eigenvalue of the interaction matrix and the lowest energy reached by numerical minimization agree well with each other for all the couplings values considered .",
    "we concluded therefore that the lowest eigenvalue of the interaction matrix corresponds to the true ground state as it gives the lowest possible energy per site .",
    "@xcite however because of the non - bravais nature of the hollandite lattice , it is not straightforward to construct the ground state spin configuration from the wave vector @xmath49 which minimizes the interaction matrix .",
    "the reason is that in a lattice with a basis , usually it is not possible to make any three - component linear combination of the lowest eigenmodes of interaction matrix ( for @xmath50 ) preserving the unit - length constraint for the spins . to construct the ground states ,",
    "we have examined an equivalent auxiliary interaction matrix ( see the appendix[sec : int - mat ] ) .",
    "this method allows to find the exact expressions for the energy per site in terms of the couplings @xmath39 s . by using this procedure",
    "we obtain a one dimensional wave vector @xmath51 which gives the ground state energy that coincides with the lowest eigenvalue of the interaction matrix obtained from eq .   and the lowest energy obtained in the numerical simulation . by associating an angle @xmath52 to the wave vector @xmath53 , we find that the ground state energy can be written as ( see appendix[sec : int - mat ] ) : @xmath54     as a function of the couplings .",
    "each contour line refers to a fraction of @xmath55 , three values are represented @xmath56 , @xmath57 and 1.@xmath55 .",
    "the ground state energy with same values of @xmath52 is identical in each quadrant , however the ground state spin configuration in each quadrant for a given @xmath52 is different as explained in the text . ]    here @xmath58 is the angle between spins connected by a @xmath34 bond in the @xmath22-direction and the angle @xmath52 is related to the angle between neighboring spins joined by @xmath35 and @xmath28 bonds .",
    "the precise relation is specified below when we classify the possible helical states . as a consequence of eq .",
    ", we find a non - commensurate helical spin configuration in the @xmath22 direction with a rotation angle of @xmath58 as shown in fig.[fig : helical ] .",
    "therefore , the angle @xmath52 measures the helicity of the spin configuration .",
    "the angle @xmath52 that minimizes the energy   is given by @xmath59 substituting the above value of @xmath60 , we find the following final expression for the ground state energy in the helical spin configuration , @xmath61    the condition for the angle @xmath62 implies that the above expression for site energy is valid only when eqn",
    ".   has a solution for @xmath52 , i.e @xmath63 .",
    "this condition determines the phase boundary between helical spin states and the simple afm ground states ( see fig.[fig : pd - j1-f ] ) . as both the energy and the angle @xmath52",
    "depend on @xmath35 and @xmath28 only through the quantity @xmath64 , we have that for each value of this quantity there is a segment in the phase diagram where the energy and the spin configurations are exactly the same for all the points in a given quadrant .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[fig : phi ] where we show a contour plot of the value @xmath52 as a function of the couplings .",
    "as can be seen from this plot the value of @xmath52 increases continuously from @xmath24 to @xmath55 forming a rhombus in phase space for a given value of @xmath52 . in general the spin configurations for a given value of @xmath52 will correspond to a non - commensurate co - planar spin",
    "arrangement ( only for some specific values of @xmath35 and @xmath28 , the angle @xmath52 is commensurate ) .",
    "it is worth to notice that we get an incommensurate ground state in the @xmath36-isotropic case where ( @xmath65 ) , for which we have @xmath66 radians , very different from the triangular lattice where there is an ordered ground state with @xmath67 angle between them .",
    "it is also important to note that the plane of polarization of the spins is arbitrary , as the hamiltonian is invariant under global rotations of the spins .",
    "the detailed analysis ( see appendix[sec : int - mat ] for more details ) reveals that there are four different helical spin arrangements that appear for four different combinations of the signs of @xmath35 and @xmath28 .",
    "we also notice that , as the angle @xmath52 increases continuously from @xmath24 to @xmath55 , each of these states eventually transforms into one and only one of the afm states found in the large @xmath44 , @xmath45 limit .",
    "therefore , we use similar notations for the four helical ground states as for the corresponding afm / fm state to which it is connected : c - h , c2-h , a2-h and f - h phase , the letter ` h ' refers to the helical nature of the ground states . in order to describe the spin arrangement in each of these helical ground states , it is useful to label a given site with index @xmath68 in a specific @xmath34-chain ( namely the @xmath22-axis as defined in the caption of fig.[fig : mno2-interactions ] ) . as we have mentioned above ,",
    "the spins rotate helically in the lattice @xmath22-direction with a rotation angle of @xmath58 ( see fig.[fig : helical ] ) .",
    "however , spins on different @xmath34-chains , connected by @xmath35 and @xmath28 bonds , can have different spin arrangements . to illustrate this difference and to describe the spin configurations , it is useful to divide all the @xmath34 into @xmath0 chains , that are the chains with an odd sublattice number as given in fig.[fig : mno2-lattice](a ) , and @xmath69 chains for even sublattices .",
    "we now describe four different ground states . in all these helical phases ,",
    "the ground states correspond to co - planar spin arrangements with the spins in the @xmath70 plane and the pitch of the chirality advances towards the @xmath22-axis .",
    "the choice of the polarization plane is arbitrary .",
    "we start with the c - h phase ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) : the spins on the @xmath0 and @xmath69 chains are parametrized as follows @xmath73 here @xmath74 and @xmath75 are unit vectors in the @xmath76 and @xmath77 spatial directions , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are spins on sites @xmath68 in the @xmath0 and @xmath69 chains respectively with @xmath80",
    ". then the arrangement of the spins in the c - h phase will be @xmath78 for odd sublattice number and @xmath79 for even sublattice number as shown in fig.[fig : xzhelical](a ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath81 and the angle between two spins in different @xmath34-chains is always @xmath52 .",
    "the ground states for the other choices of the signs of @xmath35 and @xmath28 are constructed from the c - h ground state as we now show . for the c2-h family of ground states ,",
    "we have @xmath82 ( negated with respect to c - h case ) and @xmath83 .",
    "we obtain the ground state energy if we set @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the two nearest - neighbor spins of the site @xmath68 of the @xmath0 and @xmath69 chains connected to it by the @xmath35 or @xmath28 bonds respectively . therefore ,",
    "if two @xmath34-chains are linked by @xmath35 bonds the angle between the spins in the chains is @xmath88 , while spins of the chains linked by @xmath28 bonds have an angle of @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath23 different @xmath34-chains per unit cell : @xmath0,@xmath69,@xmath89,@xmath90 as shown in fig.[fig : xzhelical](b ) .",
    "the minus sign denotes a spin flip .",
    "similar reasoning applies to the a2-h phase where @xmath71 and @xmath91 : the angle between two spins linked by @xmath35 bond is @xmath52 and spins linked by @xmath28 bond form an angle @xmath88 . the arrangement of the @xmath34-chains in the a2-h ground state is @xmath0,@xmath90,@xmath89,@xmath69 as shown in fig.[fig : xzhelical](c ) . finally in the f - h ground state where both @xmath82 and @xmath91 , the angle between two spins in different @xmath34-chains is always @xmath88 and the order of the @xmath34-chains is @xmath0,@xmath90 as shown in fig.[fig : xzhelical](d ) .",
    "it is worth to mention that the definition given above for the @xmath0 and @xmath69 index to the odd and even sublattices is not unique .",
    "in fact the definition of @xmath0 and @xmath69 chains could be interchanged by adding a constant angle @xmath92 in the argument of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 terms appearing in above eqs .  - .",

    "it is of interest to compare the distribution of angles between spins within a given triangle for the hollandite lattice to that of other 2d triangular lattices or ladders .",
    "for a given spin in a triangle in the hollandite lattice , if @xmath96 and @xmath97 denote the angle of the spins joined by @xmath34 bonds and @xmath35 ( or @xmath28 ) respectively , then we obtain the condition @xmath98 for any values of @xmath39 s and @xmath99 or @xmath100 depending on the sign of @xmath35 and @xmath28 .",
    "the relation @xmath98 has also been observed in other triangular lattices where the interaction strengths along different directions are taken different .",
    "it is also instructive to compare the resulting phase diagram with that of ising spins on the same lattice .",

    "differences appear between the heisenberg and the ising models : the heisenberg model develops different incommensurate helical spin ground states , the ising model still has the same collinear ground states .",
    "when one goes closer to the origin of phase space , @xmath103 , the ising model enters the correlated , geometrically frustrated phase , see fig .  4 in ref .",
    "this phase is absent in the heisenberg model , in which there are four different incommensurate helical ground states .",
    "the only degeneracy of these ground states is due to global spin rotations .",
    "we remark that the area of the correlated frustrated phase of the ising model is smaller than that of the helical phases , implying that the ising model underestimates the degree of geometrical frustration present in real materials , that are better described by the heisenberg model . for the ising model ,",

    "this is particularly important as in a given experiment the obtained value of @xmath134 is completely arbitrary and can not be distinguished for each phase but the relative height of other peaks compared to @xmath134 could be determined .",

    "we note that for the c - h phase and the f - h phase there is a white line at @xmath146 .",
