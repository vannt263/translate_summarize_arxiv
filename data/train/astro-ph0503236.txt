    "there are only two clusters colour detected lacking a spectroscopic redshift : one ( source _ f _ ) has @xmath36 and one ( source _ c _ ) has @xmath37 .",
    "there is a good agreement between the photometric redshift ( @xmath38 ) derived by colour and by the bcg luminosity for source _ c _ , but disagreement for source _ f _ , whose @xmath39 colour suggest @xmath6 , while its bcg suggest @xmath40 . for such a cluster it is possible that the galaxy identified as bcg is , instead , an interloper .",

    "the non - detection of the source _ h _ in @xmath39 and the red colour of the reddest of its galaxies shown in figure  [ fig : rz ] , both imply @xmath41 , in good agreement with the value estimated from the colour of the red sequence from new @xmath42 data ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we have selected 19 x - ray potentially extended sources , without obvious counterpart in deep optical images , and hence are candidates for @xmath44 clusters . all 19 objects were observed with sofi at ntt , while 14 of them were in the field surveyed in @xmath1 at ctio .",
    "observations photometrically confirm night of them as genuine high redshift clusters : they are detected as nir galaxy overdensity , their galaxies share similar enough colours that the cluster is detected by the @xmath39 ( @xmath42 , in one case ) colour detection algorithm , their brightest galaxy members have luminosity compatible with @xmath0 and the galaxies on the colour magnitude relation ( the colour of detection ) have the right colour to be early - type galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "spectroscopical observations already confirmed three of them as spectroscopic @xmath0 clusters , and three more as @xmath45 clusters .",
    "the three remaining clusters have @xmath46 and @xmath5 .",
    "our success in identifying high redshift clusters does not come unexpected .",
    "however , we show that expectations are satisfied with data . for all identified systems we give position , basic x - ray quantities ( fluxes for example ,",
    "can be computed from numbers quoted in table 1 ) , solid evidence about their photometric ( high ) redshift and , in six cases out nine , spectroscopic redshift . with the current work",
    "the number of high redshift clusters with x - ray emission has approximatively doubled .    cluster ( _ h _ has very low likelihood of extension , still it is a cluster , suggesting caution in using likelihood of extension at low x - ray counts .",
    "about half of our 19 x - ray sources are not identified as clusters of galaxies ( and not reported here individually ) .",
    "these sources should not be considered as a failure : they are unidentified sources at present",
    ". however , the identification may change with new data , which probe , for example , a different redshift range ( @xmath6 with ukidss / spitzer data ) or which increases the significance of the nir/@xmath39 detection , or which allow a full three dimensional sampling .",
    "overall , there are 5 clusters with solid evidence to be at @xmath6 ( we neglect clusters at @xmath47 and the cluster at @xmath48 ) in the inspected 2.9 deg@xmath49 .",
    "three of them are spectroscopically confirmed to be at @xmath50 .",

    "the 68 % confidence interval ( gehrels 1986 , andreon 2005 ) , assuming a poissonian probability distribution function , is @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "this estimate is a lower limit , because not all sources in the considered area have been scheduled for nir observations .",
    "we leave the discussion of the volume density of clusters at @xmath41 and selection function to bremer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "colour detection and nir overdensity achieve similar performance in confirming potentially extended x - ray sources deemed to be at @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , we are currently considering a cross - correlation between colour detected and x - ray detected clusters , without the restriction to sources with nir images ( i.e. the targets of this study ) to enlarge the @xmath0 cluster sample .",
    "the cross - correlation with x - ray is compelling if clusters with deep potential wells are to be selected and discriminated against structures of larger size ( and similar mass ) and from superposition of groups nearby in space , but not part of a single halo .",
