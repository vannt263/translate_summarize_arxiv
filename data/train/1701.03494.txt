    ", the various concepts of ideal , prime ideal , and spectrum correspond , so the question about abelian @xmath1-groups with order - unit is equivalent to the one about mv - algebras .",
    "the constructions , of the spectrum of an abelian @xmath1-group and the spectrum of an mv - algebra , are both particular cases of the following one .",
    "the spectrum of a distributive lattice  @xmath7 with zero can be defined in a similar way as the @xmath1-spectrum of an abelian @xmath1-group .",
    "a lower subset  @xmath15 , in a distributive lattice  @xmath7 with zero , is an _ ideal _ if it is closed under finite joins ( in particular , @xmath28 ) .",

    "they are also the same as spectra of commutative , unital rings ( cf .",

    "does every spectral space appear as the @xmath1-spectrum of an abelian @xmath1-group ?",
    "the answer has been known for a long time to be negative , and can be conveniently stated in terms of the _",
    "specialization order_. in any topological space  @xmath0 , let @xmath30 hold if  @xmath3 belongs to the closure of  @xmath2 , for all @xmath31 .",

    "a spectral space  @xmath0 is _ _ completely normal _ _ is completely normal if every subspace of  @xmath0 is normal .",

    "definition  [ d : complnor ] ) ; that is , the specialization order is a _ root system _ ( cf . section  [ su : posets ] ) .",
    "not every spectral space is completely normal , but the @xmath1-spectrum of any abelian @xmath1-group is completely normal .",
    "and then it turns out that completely normal spectral spaces also appear in the different context of _ real spectra _ : _ the real spectrum of any commutative , unital ring is a completely normal spectral space _ ( cf .",
    "coste and roy  @xcite , dickmann  @xcite ) .    if we let go of the topology for a while , cignoli and torrens  @xcite characterized all posets ( i.e. , partially ordered sets ) isomorphic to the specialization order on the mv - spectrum of some mv - algebra .",
    "an analogous result is proved in dickmann , gluschankof , and lucas  @xcite about real spectra .",
    "it is noteworthy that both results represent the same class of root systems , called _ spectral root systems_.    is every completely normal spectral space an @xmath1-spectrum ?",
    "delzell and madden ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 ) construct a completely normal spectral space , whose specialization order is a root system , which is not isomorphic to any mv - spectrum .",
    "however , that example is not _ second countable _",
    "( i.e. , its topology has no countable basis of open sets ) .",
    "the spectral space from example  [ ex : not1ord ] , in the present paper , is similar , although not homeomorphic .",
    "how about the countable case ?",
    "trying to represent a second countable , completely normal spectral space  @xmath0 , a basic idea would be to express  @xmath0 as an inverse limit , for a suitable concept of morphism , of finite completely normal spectral spaces , then lift the arrows between individual building blocks , and then construct a direct limit ( of abelian @xmath1-groups ) .",
    "finite completely normal spectral spaces arise from finite root systems , and it has been known for a long time that those can be lifted by lexicographical powers of , say , the integers ( see , for example , bigard , keimel , and wolfenstein  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5.4 ) ) .",
    "however , such a plan would rely on the hope that our spectral space  @xmath0 be _ profinite_. and di nola and grigolia  @xcite found an example showing that this is not always the case ; so we need to look elsewhere .",
    "any spectral space is determined , up to homeomorphism , by its ( distributive ) lattice of compact open subsets , and every distributive lattice with zero appears that way ( stone  @xcite ; see proposition  [ p : stone ] ) .",
    "it follows that the problem , of characterizing @xmath1-spectra of abelian @xmath1-groups , is equivalent to characterizing the distributive lattices with zero isomorphic to  @xmath29 for some abelian @xmath1-group  @xmath14 ( cf .",
