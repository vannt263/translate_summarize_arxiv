    "granular impact has been studied extensively for many years ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , as understanding how the intruder s momentum is collectively transferred to the grains and its energy dissipated has obvious practical applications in ballistics , meteor impacts , and industrial processes . in general , the dynamics depend on the microscale physical characteristics of the system ( e.g. , type of grains , initial packing fraction , presence of an interstitial fluid , etc . ) and the intruder velocity ( e.g. , faster or slower than the granular sound speed ) .",
    "a complete description represents a complex problem in granular rheology .    in the present study",
    ", we consider impacts with initial intruder speeds that are well below the granular sound speed , but fast enough that static or quasi - static effects provide only a modest portion of the decelerating forces .",
    "the intruders impinge on a moderately compacted , dry granular bed . for this case , many previous studies @xcite have successfully used a macroscopic force law to describe the ` slow ' dynamics , i.e. , over time scales that are much slower than granular fluctuation time scales @xcite .",
    "these force laws typically contain a velocity - squared drag force which dominates the bulk of the deceleration .",
    "in addition , they contain other terms that typically are important late in the collision process , when static granular forces that support the weight of the intruder become important .    here",
    ", we base our discussion on a typical model ( see also previous work @xcite ) with the form : @xmath0 @xmath1 is the force on the intruder , @xmath2 is the depth within the material , @xmath3 corresponds to the point of initial contact between the intruder and the unperturbed granular surface , @xmath4 is the gravitational force , @xmath5 is a static term , @xmath6 characterizes the strength of the inertial ( @xmath7 ) term , and dots denote time derivatives .",
    "often , @xmath6 is assumed to be constant , though we find that it can have an initial transient .",
    "although such models are empirical , they typically capture the ` slow ' dynamics of intruder trajectories .",
    "however , the grain scale origins of these terms are still poorly understood , and the focus of this study is to improve this understanding .    the velocity - squared term , @xmath8 , is typically understood as an inertial term , which models dynamic momentum ( and energy ) transfer from the intruder to the particles . in a previous study , using photoelastic particles @xcite , we showed that , although the slow or average dynamics are well captured by eq .  , the force is not smooth on faster time scales .",
    "rather , the force is spatio - temporally highly fluctuating due to intermittent emission of acoustic energy along relatively long - lived granular networks which are excited locally along the intruder - granular interface . in other experiments using circular- and",
    "elliptical - nosed intruders @xcite , we also showed that changes in intruder shape had a strong effect on @xmath6 .",
    "it is this effect that we pursue here , first by considering other shapes for the intruder , and second by constructing a collisional model that explicitly involves the intruder shape .",
    "specifically , in this paper , we present a comprehensive study of the dynamics of intruders with triangular noses of varying shape but constant mass and width , including the deceleration and rotation of the intruder .",
    "these data augment earlier results @xcite for circular and ogive intruders .",
    "we fit the dynamics of deceleration to the force law in eq .  , and thereby measure @xmath5 and @xmath6 for varying intruder shape . as a way to understand the shape dependence of @xmath6 and the dynamics of the rotations",
    ", we propose a mesoscopic collisional model , where the intruder is decelerated through random , repeated collisions with ` clusters ' of grains . by clusters ,",
    "we refer to force - chain - like networks that are acoustically excited as in fig .",
    "[ fig : frames ] .",
    "this collisional model contains a velocity - squared drag force , @xmath8 , which depends on the intruder size and shape in a way that incorporates the interactions of the intruder with these structures .",
    "the drag force includes an unknown @xmath9 multiplicative constant that is common to the @xmath6 coefficient for all intruders .",
    "once this coefficient is determined using one shape of intruder , all other aspects of the model can easily be tested by using other intruder shapes . using this approach",
    ", we find good agreement between the experimental data and the model for the velocity - dependent drag force .",
    "in these experiments , we consider a range of intruder types , including intruders with triangular ` noses ' , as well as intruders with curved shapes such as ogives and disks that we have studied previously  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we show that the collisional model captures the rotational dynamics of the intruder , which become more striking as the length of the intruder nose increases .",
    "the key feature for the inertial term of the model is momentum transfer to clusters of grains , based on nominally specular inelastic collisions of clusters with the intruder .",
    "these collisions are affected by the local shape and speed of the intruder at the collision point .",
    "we also find that the tip of each triangular intruder ( which is slightly rounded to avoid breaking particles ) yields a disproportionately large collisional effect , compared to other parts of the intruder . by adding the tip contribution to the rest of the shape - dependent contribution",
    ", we show that the collisional model captures the velocity - squared drag for all intruders .    the static term , @xmath5 , in eq .",
    "[ eqn : forcelaw ] is also of interest , although the collisional term dominates the stopping process .",
    "however , in the present experiments , we fix the cross sectional area and mass of the intruder , which are likely to affect @xmath5 . we then observe that even large variation in shape , at fixed width and mass , does not substantially affect @xmath5 .",
    "however , a recent study @xcite suggested this term was due to static , depth - dependent friction , and had a strong dependence on intruder shape , especially while the intruder nose was only partially submerged . understanding how @xmath5 depends on intruder shape",
    "should also give insight into the grain - scale processes which control it .",
    "brzinski , et al .",
    "@xcite placed intruders of various shapes ( spheres , cylinders , and cones ) at various depths in a granular bed .",
    "they then measured for each depth the maximum force which the granular material could support before failing .",
    "additionally , they imposed a controlled airflow through the grains to alter the the strength of hydrostatic pressure via gravitational loading .",
    "they focused on the regime _ before _",
    "the intruder nose was fully submerged . in this regime , they found shape dependence which is consistent with a static , depth - dependent pressure which points normally inward at each grain - intruder contact , where the static pressure is a direct result of hydrostatic loading from the grains above .",
    "once the intruder nose was fully submerged , they found the same static force for all intruders with the same cross - sectional area ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ) , with a small correction for the nose shape .",
    "they then inferred that this force is indeed the static term in dynamic experiments , @xmath5 , by measuring the final penetration depth versus drop height for spheres and cylinders .",
    "they found that these results were consistent with their previous measurements of the static force . in our experiments , which focus on the regime after the nose is submerged , we observe that even large variation in shape ( at fixed intruder width ) does not substantially affect the static force term , @xmath5 , a result that is consistent with the findings of brzinski , et al . however , our measurements ( here , and in @xcite ) , as well as measurements by goldman and umbanhowar @xcite , show a substantial offset term once the nose is fully submerged , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 scales with the intruder mass .    the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the details of the collisional model , including predictions for the drag force and torque , which we will reference throughout the remainder of the paper . in section iii , we describe the experiment and the techniques used to collect and analyze the data . in section iv , we present the data for the intruder trajectories ( including depth , velocity , deceleration , and rotations , as well as @xmath5 and @xmath6 for each intruder ) , and we then compare the experimental results to the predictions of the collisional model for the velocity - squared drag force and rotational dynamics . figs .  [",
    "fig : hvsi ] and [ fig : gammainstability ] are the culmination of this analysis .",
    "section v contains a summary , conclusions , and outlook .",
    "the basis of the model proposed here is that the intruder transfers momentum to the granular material through a sequence of random collisions that excite the force network , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : frames ] . to develop this idea further , we consider quantitative grain - scale force response to impacts , reported earlier @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained using particles made from a ` hard ' photoelastic material , such that the speed of the intruder was always slow compared to the sound speed through the material . for these conditions ,",
    "the intruder deceleration was dominated by interactions with filamentary networks of grains ( often referred to as force chains ) that carried relatively large forces . as the intruder pushed through the granular bed , acoustic pulses generated at the intruder - granular interface , propagated along these strong force networks , carrying momentum and energy away from the intruder .",
    "these networks changed with time , but persisted long enough to carry one or more acoustic pulses .",
    "in particular , they were long enough lived to exhibit clear tracks on space - time plots of the local granular force  @xcite .",
    "we refer to the grains in one of the networks as a cluster .",
    "but , we emphasize the filamentary quasi-1d structure formed by such a cluster .",
    "specifically , clusters are not usually collections of grains in a simple ( e.g. roughly circular ) 2d region .",
    "typically , the networks emanated from the lower boundary of the intruder at angles that were close to the boundary normal .",
    "thus , collisions transfered momentum into the intruder at a set of point - like contacts , such that the momentum carried along the network is normal to the local surface ( at least initially ) .",
    "typical images in figure  [ fig : frames ] demonstrate this feature and correspond to one frame for each of the seven triangular intruders .",
    "each frame is chosen at a time for which there is a collision with a grain cluster .",
    "since we can not resolve particles , we are unable to definitively say how many particles are involved in each one of these clusters .",
    "however , as a way to estimate the cluster size , we divide the total number of bright pixels beneath the intruder ( @xmath14 intruder radii from the bottom edge of a circular intruder ) by the total number of bright pixels within one particle diameter from the bottom edge of the intruder , using only image frames where at least one particle ( about 50 pixels ) is bright at the intruder edge .",
    "figure  [ fig : clustersize ] shows a histogram of this measurement from a single trajectory using a circular intruder , which shows an average cluster size of about ten particles .",
    "intruder radii of the bottom edge of a circular intruder ( although the measurement is insensitive to the size of the region used ) by the number of bright pixels within one particle diameter of the intruder nose .",
    "the above plot was obtained from a single trajectory using a circular intruder , and the plot only includes frames where at least 50 pixels are bright at the intruder edge , to make sure that the intruder is in contact with a particle cluster .",
    "this result is typical for all trajectories . ]",
    "we then construct a simplified version of this process in order to calculate the force acting on the intruder . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] , we imagine an object with mass @xmath15 , profile specified by @xmath16 , and width @xmath17 , moving at a velocity @xmath18 , undergoing repeated inelastic collisions with small , stationary objects . here , these small objects are grain  clusters \" , in the above sense , which we take to have mass @xmath19 .",
    "we expect that @xmath19 is greater than the mass of a single grain , since a collision involves force - chain - like structures that remain in contact over a finite time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] , the clusters are now represented as mesoscopic ` particles ' .",
    "a related collisional picture was proposed by takehara , et al .",
    "@xcite . in their study",
    ", an intruder was subjected to constant - velocity drag through a granular medium , and the drag force was measured with a high - speed force sensor .",
    "the drag force was measured to be quadratic in velocity , and , based on momentum - transfer considerations as well as images of the motion of the grains , takehara and colleagues argued that it is the result of repeated collisions with particle clusters which are larger than the mass of a single grain . although they could not visualize grain scale forces , they nevertheless concluded that  the formation of the dynamical force chains plays a crucial role . \"",
    "our approach is similar , but we are able to directly verify the role of the granular network , and relate the structure of that network to the collisional properties of our intruders .",
    "it is also interesting that the speeds used by takehara et al .",
    "were roughly an order of magnitude smaller than our fastest impact speeds .",
    "this means that the collisional forces are important over a surprisingly large range of intruder speeds .",
    "randomly collides with grain clusters ( represented by the open circles ) as it moves at velocity @xmath18 .",
    "the collisions occur along the ` nose ' , i.e. the leading edge of the intruder , at positions @xmath20 measured from the center of mass .",
    "these collisions involve momentum transfer normally into the intruder , along normal vector @xmath21 . ]",
    "we next assume that the clusters behave as quasi - particles which collide inelastically with the surface of the intruder .",
    "we assume collisions in the direction of the surface normal , @xmath21 , that are inelastic and captured ( in that direction ) by a restitution coefficient , @xmath22 .",
    "momentum in the direction parallel to the intruder interface is unaffected by the collision .",
    "a collision imparts momentum @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the angle between the velocity and @xmath21 .",
    "we take the typical collision time to be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the particle diameter and @xmath27 is an @xmath9 constant .",
    "thus , the average force at a particular location along the intruder surface is in the @xmath21-direction , given by : @xmath28 note that , since the bronze intruders we use are much more dense than the photoelastic material used for particles , the reduced mass in our case is approximately equal to the mass of a cluster , @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that collisions are equally likely per unit normal area .",
    "thus , the relative number of collisions in a length of intruder surface @xmath30 is @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is another @xmath9 parameter ) , so @xmath33 . if the shape of the intruder is given by @xmath34 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] , then @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "this force is quadratic in the velocity and depends on the local shape of the intruder surface , varying as @xmath37 . by integrating this force over the intruder surface",
    ", we can obtain a specific prediction about the effect of intruder shape on the @xmath7 term , effectively giving @xmath6 , in terms of a shape factor , multiplied by an @xmath9 multiplicative term that is the same for all intruders , regardless of shape , for a given bed material .",
    "we first consider only vertically upward ( @xmath2-component ) of @xmath38 by integrating over the leading edge of the intruder and keeping only the @xmath2-component : @xmath39\\cdot v^2 = h(z ) v^2 % f_z=\\int d\\vec{f}\\cdot\\hat{z}=b_0 i[c(x)]\\cdot v^2 f_z&=&\\int d\\vec{f}\\cdot\\hat{z}\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{(1+e)\\beta m_cm}{\\gamma d^2(m_c+m)}\\left[\\int_{-w/2}^{w/2}dx(1+c'^2)^{-1}\\right]v^2\\nonumber \\\\ & = & b_0\\cdot i[c(x)]\\cdot v^2 .",

    "this model considers only the collisional part of the drag force , and gives no prediction about the shape effects for the @xmath5 term .",
    "however , this term tends to be important only as the intruder is coming to rest . in section iv , in our discussion of rotations , we return to this issue , showing that @xmath45 of the trajectory ( in terms of distance ) is dominated by the velocity - squared drag force . note too , that , although the real grain clusters near the surface of the intruder are also moving , their velocity relative to the intruder should scale with the intruder velocity , so this analysis should still hold up to a constant scale factor of order unity .    for this study",
    ", we particularly focus on intruders with triangular noses , intended as two - dimensional ` cones ' as in @xcite , which have a constant slope , @xmath46 , everywhere except at the tip .",
    "this yields a very simple form for @xmath41 $ ] , which allows a straightforward method to separate shape from other effects : @xmath47 the constant slope for conical intruders allows us to unambigously focus on the directional effects assumed in the collisional model .",
    "additionally , moderate variation in @xmath48here , we use seven triangular - nosed intruders , with slope @xmath48 varying between 0 and 3 , in increments of 0.5gives an order of magnitude change in @xmath49 ( i.e. , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "this provides a sensitive test of the collisional model .",
    "we also include data for the collisional drag coefficient measured for circular- and elliptical - nosed intruders , which was presented in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "for circular or elliptical noses , @xmath41 $ ] has the following form : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes , respectively ( the limit for a circular nose , @xmath55 , is well defined , specifically @xmath56 . )",
    "experiments show that intruders can rotate as they move through the granular medium .",
    "if a symmetric intruder is tilted at an angle @xmath57 from vertical , the forces on either side are generally different from what they would be if the intruder were vertically oriented .",
    "most importantly , the forces are not the same on either side of the intruder , which is particularly evident for triangular - noses , where the intruder - cluster collision angles clearly differ from side to side .",
    "such a tilt has several consequences .",
    "first , the vertical force may differ from the corresponding value when the intruder is vertical ; second , there can be a horizontal component of the force ; and third , there may be a non - zero torque on the intruder .",
    "it is possible to correct for the effect of rotations on the vertical force by recalculating @xmath58 based on a @xmath16 that includes the instantaneous @xmath57 for the intruder ( i.e. calculate @xmath59 ) , and use this in the computation of @xmath58 . note that the vertical force , which is determined by @xmath58 , must have an extremum at @xmath60 , since the force must be invariant to whether @xmath57 is positive or negative . the horizontal force and",
    "the torque are not subject to the same symmetry principle , so a small tilt will lead to values of these quantities that are @xmath61 . in the present experiments , the corrections to the vertical force and the relative magnitude of the horizontal force",
    "are small compared to the unperturbed part of the vertical force .    however , the same is not generally true for the torque . particularly in the late stages of the dynamics",
    ", we observe substantial rotations for some intruders .",
    "thus , the torque on an intruder at an angle @xmath57 must be calculated in a method similar to eq .  .",
    "this yields quantitative predictions for the dynamics of rotation , including the prediction of rotational instability .",
    "the total torque , @xmath62 , about the center of mass of the intruder is given by integrating @xmath63 over all collisions over the intruder surface , similarly to eq .",
    ": @xmath64 here , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , as before ( see the sketch in fig .  [",
    "fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "this yields : @xmath68v^2 \\hat{y}. \\label{eqn : torque - tot2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      a last issue concerns the concentration of stress at the tip of the triangular intruders , particularly the more pointed ones . by examining the photoelastic response near the intruder , we can separate the relative contributions from collisions with the tip and collisions elsewhere on the smooth intruder surface .",
    "the tip is quite small , with a radius of curvature that is a fraction of a particle radius .",
    "it is still possible to calculate a shape factor for the tip , @xmath69 $ ] , where @xmath70 is the shape of the rounded tip .",
    "however , this analysis is misleading , because the probability of a collision at the tip is far greater than elsewhere on the smooth surface of the intruder . by analyzing the photoelastc response near the tip , and in other regions , as shown in the top of fig .",
    "[ fig : photodrag ] , we find that the tip contribution to the velocity - squared force is approximately the same for intruders with prominent tips ( i.e. , large @xmath48 ) , but it is considerably larger per unit area , by about an order of magnitude , than contributions from collisions away from the tip . the term due to collisions with the tip must be included separately in the force and torque calculations for accurate prediction of the velocity - squared drag and off - axis rotations .",
    "the experimental apparatus is the same as that used in previous studies @xcite .",
    "it consists of a two - dimensional granular bed of approximately 25,000 bidisperse , hard , photoelastic disks ( diameters of 6  mm and 4.3  mm , thickness of 3  mm , with approximately equal numbers of each size of particle ) confined between two thick plexiglas sheets ( 0.91  m @xmath71 1.22  m @xmath71 1.25  cm ) separated by a thin gap ( 3.3  mm ) .",
    "the photoelastic disks are cut from ps-1 material ( vishay precision group ; bulk density of 1.28  g/@xmath72 , elastic modulus of 2.5 gpa , and poisson s ratio of 0.38 ) .",

    "intruders , which are machined from bronze sheet ( bulk density of 8.91  g/@xmath72 and thickness of 2.3  mm ) , are dropped from above the layer with an initial orientation that closely corresponds to @xmath60 , and have initial impact speeds up to @xmath73  m / s .",
    "a photron fastcam sa5 records the process at a resolution of 256@xmath71584 pixels ( @xmath74 pixels per @xmath26 ) , and at 40,000 frames per second .",
    "the triangular - nosed intruders are comprised of a downward - pointing isosceles triangle , symmetric about the vertical axis , with opening angle @xmath75 , attached to a rectangular tail of the same width as the base of the triangle , @xmath76  cm .",
    "the noses of these intruders are clearly evident in fig .",
