    "non - magnetic spin control is among the most rapidly developing topics of modern semiconductor spin physics .",
    "substantial progress has been achieved by application of the pump - probe technique to bulk semiconductors , quantum wells and quantum dots , where spins are created , manipulated and detected by optical pulses  @xcite .",
    "singly charged quantum dot structures are of particular interest . in these systems",
    "discrete energy spectrum of charge carriers makes resonant optical excitation possible , which substantially enhances spin - photon coupling . at the same time , quenching the orbital motion due to size quantization suppresses significantly the spin - orbit induced spin decoherence making it possible to achieve long spin lifetimes of single electrons or holes .",
    "in addition to robust optical initialization of electron spin by polarized light , spin polarization readout  @xcite , and ultrafast spin rotation by light  @xcite , in quantum dot ensembles a number of prominent effects , such as spin precession mode - locking and nuclei - induced frequency focussing have been demonstrated  @xcite , see , e.g. ,  ref .",
    "@xcite for review .",
    "the spin - photon interfacing and optical spin control has also been demonstrated for single quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "the charge carrier spin state is , as a rule , detected by the faraday or kerr rotation . typically , the faraday rotation angle was on the order of @xmath0 degrees in refs .",
    "the efficiency of spin - photon interaction can be strongly enhanced by placing the active system into a microcavity , where the electric field and , accordingly , faraday / kerr rotation are accumulated due to multiple passages of light between the mirrors  @xcite .",
    "it makes possible to reach giant spin - faraday effect in bulk semiconductor  @xcite , and even to detect a host - lattice nuclei - induced faraday rotation  @xcite . on a single spin level embedding a quantum dot qd into a microcavity",
    "has enabled to achieve a resident hole spin control  @xcite and detect fluctuations of a single spin  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a macroscopic rotation of photon polarization reaching several degrees has been observed in a single qd deterministically coupled to a photonic mode of a micropillar cavity demonstrating efficient spin - photon coupling  @xcite .    in quantum - dot / microcavity structures two regimes of light - matter interaction , namely , weak and strong coupling ,",
    "are known  @xcite . in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "realized in above works  @xcite , the dampings of cavity mode and trion exceed their coupling constant , while in the strong coupling regime the dampings are small as compared with the coupling constant , see ref .",
    "@xcite for rigorous criterion , and the coherent energy transfer between the photon and material excitation becomes possible .",
    "the strong coupling regime has been already achieved for neutral qds placed in various types of microcavities  @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for review .    the strong coupling between a two - level quantum system and a single electromagnetic mode in a zero - dimensional cavity results in a formation of the jaynescummings ladder of coupled states  @xcite .",
    "the rung splitting in this ladder is dependent on the number of photon quanta in the cavity .",
    "the spectroscopic manifestation of this dependence carries a direct signature of the quantization of light and reveals non - semiclassical properties of the intracavity field as observed in atomic systems  @xcite , superconducting circuits  @xcite , and in microcavities with neutral quantum dots , where zero - dimensional exciton provides the two - level atom - like nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "fundamental limitations on realization of the strong coupling regime for the charged qds embedded into microcavities are absent  @xcite : the light - matter interaction is accompanied by generation of trions , three particle fermionic complexes with two electrons in the spin singlet state and a hole with an unpaired spin in case of the resident electron ( @xmath1 trion ) or with two holes and unpaired electron in case of the resident hole ( @xmath2 trion ) .",
    "this brings spin degree of freedom into the jaynes - cummings ladder and calls for a theory of the optical control of a single spin in the qd cavity quantum - electrodynamics structure operating in the strong coupling regime .",
    "such a theory is developed in the present paper .",
    "we demonstrate a possibility to initialize the electron spin by a single circularly polarized pulse in the transverse magnetic field .",
    "it is also shown that the train of pulses leads to a complete spin orientation .",
    "moreover , we predict an efficient spin rotation by the circularly polarized control pulse and tens of degrees for the spin - kerr and faraday rotation angles of the probe pulse .",
    "we consider a zero - dimensional microcavity with an embedded negatively charged qd .",
    "we denote the growth axis as @xmath3 axis , and assume that the light is incident along  @xmath3 .",
    "the scheme of the system under study is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme : sys ] .",
    "the cavity eigenfrequency @xmath4 is assumed to be close to the trion resonant frequency @xmath5 in the dot , and for simplicity we assume the two orthogonally polarized cavity modes to be degenerate . in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath6 applied along the @xmath7-axis ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system @xmath8 is written as a sum of the light - matter interaction operator @xmath9 and the zeeman hamiltonian @xmath10 here @xmath11 are the creation and annihilation operators for the @xmath12 circularly - polarized cavity photons , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , for the electron with the spin @xmath3-component @xmath15 and the singlet trion with the heavy - hole angular - momentum projection @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the photon - trion coupling constant , @xmath18 is the larmor frequency of the electron spin precession in the magnetic field , @xmath19 is the electron @xmath20-factor describing the zeeman effect . due to a small value of the transverse lnde factor for heavy holes @xcite we neglect , hereafter , the trion spin precession .",
    "we assume the qd size to be small compared with the exciton bohr radius which allows us to treat the trions ( three - particle complexes ) as fermions  @xcite and use for @xmath14 the fermionic commutation relations .",

    "in such a regime , the hamiltonian @xmath52 leads to coherent spin beats at the frequency @xmath53 between these two ground states , whereas all the other states remain negligibly affected   and @xmath24 photons , i.e. , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . under the considered conditions these states can be realized for linearly or elliptically polarized incident light , i.e. , for the probe .",

    "a general description of the decay and decoherence processes would require the inclusion of the relaxation and dephasing sources ( i.e. , electron - phonon interaction , coupling with other photon modes , etc . ) in the hamiltonian of a system  @xcite .",
    "however , in the present study we restrict the analysis to the simplest possible model , considering only the markovian processes that can be described by eq .  .",
    "in the following the spin relaxation processes of electron and trion ( e.g. , splin - flip and/or spin - decoherence experienced by the hole spin in the trion state , even in the absence of trion decay ) are also neglected because for the zero - dimensional carrier states they are slow as compared with the trion decay rate @xmath45 and the photon decay rate @xmath44 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "accordingly , they play no role in the spin orientation and control .",

    "as for the product @xmath73 , its value is left arbitrary .",
    "the process of spin initialization or control of a resident electron by short circularly - polarized pulses can conveniently be divided into three stages corresponding , in accordance with the inequalities  , to three different time scales : ( i ) on the time scale of @xmath74 where both the magnetic field and relaxation processes are unimportant and the action of a pump / control pulse can be described in the framework of the hamiltonian   with @xmath75 , ( ii ) on the time scale @xmath76 one should take into account the magnetic field in eq .  , and",
    "( iii ) for @xmath77 the photon decay becomes important .",

    ", we consider the spin dynamics under the excitation by @xmath23 polarized pulses . similarly to the pump - probe experiments on single qds and qd arrays without a cavity @xcite , the repetition period of the pump pulses is assumed to be longer than the damping times @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "hence the accumulated photons have the time to escape the cavity and the system returns to the ground state before the arrival of the next optical pulse .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to trace the behavior of the system following a single optical pulse .",
    "in addition , we point out that for a circularly - polarized excitation the system evolution is simplified .",
    "if only @xmath23 photons are injected into the cavity , i.e. , @xmath80 , the system evolution is limited to the subset of states corresponding to @xmath81 , and the states with spin @xmath82 remain unexcited . with explicit notations",

    "it is worth stressing that the statistics of uncoupled ladder of states , related with @xmath113 , is described by the coherent glauber distribution inherent for the classical light  @xcite .",
