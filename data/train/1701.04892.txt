    "two end - member mechanisms have been proposed for gas giant planet formation , core accretion ( e.g. , mizuno 1980 ) and gas disk gravitational instability ( e.g. , cameron 1978 ) .",
    "the former depends on the reliable mechanism of the collisional accumulation of solid bodies , widely accepted as the formation mechanism for the terrestrial planets ( e.g. , wetherill 1990 , 1996 ) .",
    "if a growing solid core should exceed a critical core mass ( mizuno 1980 ) , its atmosphere will become unstable and the core will rapidly gain mass by accretion of gas and solids from the surrounding disk ( e.g. , pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) , resulting in a gas giant planet .",
    "disk instability , on the other hand , relies on the disk being massive and cold enough to become gravitationally unstable , forming spiral arms that grow and collide to form dense , self - gravitating clumps of gas and dust that might collapse and contract to form giant gaseous protoplanets ( e.g. , boss 1997 ) .",
    "hybrid mechanisms may also be considered for forming terrestrial and gas giant planets ( e.g. , boss 1998 ; nayakshin 2010 ) .",
    "lissauer & stevenson ( 2007 ) presented a review of the core accretion mechanism , while durisen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) reviewed the disk instability mechanism .",
    "more recently , helled et al .",
    "( 2014 ) reviewed both mechanisms , listing the strengths and weaknesses of each end - member , without reaching a definite conclusion about either mechanism .",
    "rather , helled et al . ( 2014 ) called for considerably more research on specific theoretical problems for both mechanisms . one problem highlighted by helled et al . ( 2014 ) is the question about whether or not disk instability can lead successfully to giant protoplanet formation inside about 20 au , where high optical depths in the disk mean that radiative cooling is crucial for clump formation and survival . that challenge is the focus of this paper .",
    "we begin with a brief summary of the current status of observational constraints on giant planet formation models , both from studies of protoplanetary disks and from exoplanet detection surveys , before turning to a reconsideration of the disk radiative cooling problem that is the primary motivation for this new suite of disk instability models .",
    "observational constraints on planet formation models range from estimates of the initial conditions for planet formation , namely studies of protoplanetary disks , which provide the feedstock for planetary systems , to exoplanet demographics , the final result of the planet formation process .",
    "disk masses , temperatures , and lifetimes are key discriminators for comparing the disk instability and core accretion mechanisms .",
    "the most essential constraint is having sufficient disk mass to form a planetary system , by either core accretion or disk instability .",
    "the minimum mass solar nebula was estimated by weidenschilling ( 1977 ) to be in the range of 0.01 to 0.07 @xmath1 , but most citations refer only to the _ minimum _ of this range ( 0.01 @xmath1 ) as being the minimum mass solar nebula .",
    "this estimate also assumes a 100% efficient planet formation process , and so in reality these estimates of 0.01 to 0.07 @xmath1 represent _ lower bounds _ on the mass of the protoplanetary disk needed to produce our solar system ( weidenschilling 1977 ) . from this point of view , the solar nebula",
    "might well have had a mass of @xmath3 or more .",
    "considerably more information on the range of protoplanetary disk masses is obtained by millimeter - wave astronomy .",
    "millimeter wave observations of 11 low- and intermediate - mass pre - main - sequence stars implied that their disks formed with masses in the range from 0.05 to 0.4 @xmath1 ( isella et al .",
    "submillimeter wave observations of t tauri stars in the @xmath4 1 myr old ophiuchus star - forming region imply disk masses in the range from 0.004 to 0.143 @xmath1 ( andrews et al",
    ". similar observations of young stars in the even younger ( @xmath4 0.5 myr old ) cluster ngc 2024 found disk masses ranging from @xmath4 0.003 to 0.2 @xmath1 ( mann et al . 2015 ) , with @xmath4 10% having disk masses",
    "greater than 0.1 @xmath1 , a considerably higher fraction than in the older taurus star - forming region .",
    "millimeter wave observations of class ii disks in the taurus star - forming region imply that the inferred dust disk masses scale roughly proportionally to the masses of their host stars ( andrews et al .",
    "however , estimates of total disk masses have long suffered from the uncertain conversion of the observed mass of the growing dust grains ( e.g. , banzatti et al .",
    "2011 ) that produce the submillimeter continuum emission to the inferred gas disk mass , potentially leading to substantial underestimates of the total disk masses ( andrews & williams 2007 ) .",
    "high optical depth midplanes , even at millimeter wavelengths , can lead to weak dust continuum emission and hence underestimates of the true disk mass ( forgan et al .",
    "disk mass estimates based on observations of molecular species also depend on the assumed grain size distribution , leading to underestimated disk masses by as much as a factor of 10 ( miotello et al .",
    "2014 ; dunham et al .",
    "however , observations of the isotopologues of co gas may offer a direct estimate of the mass of gas in protoplanetary disks ( miotello et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "disks with masses of @xmath4 25% that of their host star will be gravitationally unstable and produce spiral arms similar to those in two protoplanetary disks , mwc 758 and sao 206462 ( dong et al .",

    "episodic fu orionis outbursts in young solar - type stars are best explained by disks that are at least partially gravitationally unstable ( e.g. , zhu et al .",

    "all of these observations suggest that a significant fraction of protoplanetary disks are still gravitationally unstable during their earliest phases of evolution , when massive protostellar disks transition into less - massive protoplanetary disks .",
    "disk lifetimes are another key constraint , especially for the core accretion mechanism , where gas disk lifetimes of @xmath4 1 myr or longer are typically required to form gas giant planets ( e.g. , pollack et al .",
    "1996 ; hubickyj et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the conventional wisdom , based on ir excesses , is that typical disk lifetimes are in the range of 1 to 10 myr , with an average age of @xmath4 3 myr ( e.g. , figure 11 in hernandez et al . 2008 ) .",
    "these statistics refer to young stars of different evolution classes in a variety of stellar groups . when restricting the sample to include only class iii sources , cieza et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that roughly @xmath4 50% of the youngest of 230 weak - line t tauri stars showed no evidence for ir excesses , suggesting that half of the disks dissipate on time scales of @xmath4 1 myr or less .",
    "these observations refer solely to ir excesses , wavelengths where the disks are optically thick and the dust disk mass is difficult to estimate",
    ". however , protoplanetary disks are optically thin at submillimeter wavelengths , making submillimeter dust continuum observations capable of producing more reliable dust disk masses , and hence gas disk masses .",
    "a submillimeter survey of nearly 300 ysos in the @xmath7 orionis cluster detected only 9 disks , finding a mean disk mass of 0.5 jupiter masses ( @xmath8 ) for these ysos with ages of @xmath4 3 myr ( williams et al .",
    "2013 ) , and implying that gas giant planet formation needs to finish well within 3 myr .",
    "a similar survey of the slightly younger ( 2 - 3 myr old ) cluster ic 348 found disk masses in the range of 1.5 to 16 @xmath8 ( cieza et al .",
    "2015 ) for 13 out of the 370 cluster members , implying that disks with at least the mass ( @xmath9 ) of the lower bound on the minimum mass solar nebula ( weidenschilling 1977 ) are very rare , occurring less than about 1% of the time at the age of the ic 348 cluster .",
    "in contrast , near - ir excesses occur for roughly half of the stars in ic 348 and @xmath7 orionis ( e.g. , hernandez et al .",
    "2008 ) , showing that the conventional wisdom about gas disk lifetimes has been severely skewed by a reliance on ir excesses .",
    "the submillimeter surveys imply a typical gas disk lifetime closer to 1 myr than to 3 myr , at least for disks capable of forming gas giant planets .",
    "disk midplane temperatures , along with disk surface densities , determine the toomre ( 1964 ) @xmath10 stability value , and hence the propensity for a disk to be gravitationally unstable .",
    "the solar nebula is the protoplanetary disk for which one would think we have the best information about its properties .",
    "cometary compositions are often used to place constraints on solar nebula temperatures at their time of formation .",
    "molecular abundance ratios determined for the comet 67p imply that if its ice grains agglomerated from clathrates ( mousis et al .",
    "2016 ) , then this jupiter - family comet must have formed in a region of the solar nebula with temperatures in the range of about 32 k to 70 k ( lectez et al . 2015 ) .",
    "jupiter - family comets are believed to have been formed beyond neptune , in the kuiper belt , whereas oort cloud comets are thought to have formed inward of neptune , where jupiter and the other giant planets could scatter them outward to much longer period orbits .",
    "comet c/1999 s4 is a long period comet from the oort cloud , containing ammonia ices with ortho - to - para ratios ( opr ) that imply formation at a temperature of about 28 k ( kawakita et al . 2001 ) .",
    "measurements of the opr for cometary water have often been used to infer even lower nebular temperatures , in the range of 10 k to 20 k ( e.g. , hogerheijde et al .",
    "however , hama et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have disputed the commonly assumed relationship between water opr and temperature , casting some doubt on use of the water opr as a cometary thermometer for the solar nebula .",
    "other disk temperature estimates come from observations of protoplanetary disks around young solar - type stars .",
    "observations of the dm tau outer disk , on scales of 50 to 60 au , imply midplane temperatures of 13 to 20 k ( dartois et al . 2003 ) , with surface temperatures of @xmath4 30 k. theoretical disk models that reproduce the observed spectral energy distributions for t tauri - star disks typically predict disk midplane temperatures of @xmath4 200 k at 1 au , @xmath4 40 k at 10 au , and @xmath4 15 k at 100 au ( lachaume et al .",

    "hl tau is less than 1 - 2 myr old and has a disk mass of @xmath12 .",
    "models suggest that the three main gaps at 15 , 35 , and 70 au could be caused by embedded protoplanets with masses of 0.2 , 0.27 , and 0.55 @xmath8 ( dipierro et al .",
    "2015 ) . a direct imaging search for embedded planets in the 70 au gap placed only upper limits of @xmath13 on the unseen objects ( testi et al . 2015 ) .",
    "testi et al .",
    "( 2015 ) noted that boss ( 2011 ) showed that the hl tau disk could form a @xmath14 planet at 70 au by disk instability , a planet massive enough to cause the gap , but not massive enough to have been directly imaged .",
    "akiyama et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have shown that all of the observed gaps in the hl tau disk are consistent with gas giant formation by disk instability , coupled with inward migration .",

    "the hl tau system thus may represent the foremost poster child for gas giant planet formation by disk gravitational instability .",
    "the hl tau disk is threaded with a magnetic field that is coincident with its major axis ( stephens et al .",
    "2014 ) , implying that the field does not control the dynamics of the disk . in a related vein",
    ", recent work on the allende meteorite has shown that its magnetization was derived from its parent body , not the solar nebula ( fu et al .",

    "- magnetic disk instability models appear to be relevant to both the hl tau disk and the solar nebula , and presumably to other protoplanetary disks as well .",
    "the ultimate constraints on theoretical models of planetary formation are derived from the results of the ongoing world - wide effort to determine the population statistics of exoplanets with widely varying masses , mean densities , atmospheric compositions , and orbital properties .",
    "the spectacular discoveries of thousands of exoplanets by the kepler mission ( borucki et al .",
    "2010 , 2011a , b ) have revolutionized the field , and made possible direct comparisons with the predictions of exoplanet population synthesis ( epops ) models based on the core accretion mechanism .",
    "perhaps most dramatically , the kepler detections imply that the number of planets per star appears to be a roughly monotonically increasing function of decreasing exoplanet radius ( fressin et al .",
    "2013 ) , at least down to radii of @xmath15 ( earth radii ) , contrary to the predictions of epops models .",
    "early epops models ( e.g. , ida & lin 2005 , 2008 ) were based on the population uncovered primarily by radial velocity ( rv ) and ground - based transit photometry surveys and were able to select model parameters that fit reasonably well the exoplanets known at the time .",
    "these models ( e.g. , figure 3 in ida & lin 2008 ) predicted a dearth of planets with masses in the super - earth mass range and short period orbits ( i.e. , inside @xmath4 1 au ) , the so - called _ exoplanet desert _",

    ", kepler found an _ exoplanet oasis _ where the epops predicted a desert : batalha ( 2014 ) showed that kepler had found the highest frequency of exoplanets in the region where the desert had been predicted , and no evidence for a pile - up of hot exoplanets with orbital periods of a few days .",
    "the same problem besets the more recent epops models of alibert et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and mordasini et al .",
    "epops models with a new prescription for orbital migration have filled in part of the desert , but only at the cost of over - producing massive gas giants and shifting the desert upward to higher masses ( see figure 8 in dittkrist et al .",

    "epops models that include gas giant planet formation by disk instability ( e.g. , forgan & rice 2013 ) might offer a means to escape some of the inward orbital migration and surplus gas giant planet problems that beset pure core accretion epops models by shortening gas disk lifetimes , and by stopping cores from migrating inward and growing to become gas giants .",
    "the kepler mission s 4-yr survey of the field in cygnus - lyra prohibited the detection of exoplanets with orbital periods greater than about 1 yr .",
    "other techniques shed light on the demographics at greater distances .",

    "a similar result was found in the ca models of coleman & nelson ( 2016 ) . at best",
    ", ca would seem to require the formation of massive icy cores in the inner disk , which are then scattered to the outer disk by close encounters with one or more inner gas giants .",

    "meru & bate ( 2011b ) even suggested that in the absence of clear indications of numerical convergence , a critical value might not exist .",

    "evidently initial @xmath10 values in the range of 1 to 2 are considered reasonable starting values for di models with @xmath0 cooling .",
    "in order to allow a direct comparison with previous work , the new models were calculated with the same basic code that has been used in all of the author s previous studies of disk instability .",
    "the primary change was to replace the radiative transfer subroutine that calculates the energy changes due to radiative flux with the @xmath0 cooling formula .",
    "the numerical code solves the three dimensional equations of hydrodynamics and the poisson equation for the gravitational potential and is second - order - accurate in both space and time .",
    "a complete description of the entire code is given by boss & myhill ( 1992 ) , while the updated energy equation of state is described by boss ( 2007 ) .",
    "also , the central protostar is effectively forced to wobble in order to preserve the location of the center of mass of the entire system ( boss 1998 , 2012 ) , which is accomplished by altering the apparent location of the point mass source of the star s gravitational potential in order to balance the center of mass of the disk .",

    "boss ( 2006 ) found that small amounts of tensor av had little effect on fragmentation , while large amounts could suppress fragmentation , as was also found by pickett et al .",
    "av is designed to stabilize and capture the microphysics of heating in strong shocks , and the effect of its inclusion in @xmath0 cooling models remains to be investigated .",
    "the numerical code solves the specific internal energy @xmath51 equation ( boss & myhill 1992 ) :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the gas density , @xmath54 is time , @xmath55 is the velocity , @xmath56 is the gas pressure , and @xmath57 is the time rate of change of energy per unit volume , which is normally taken to be that due to the transfer of energy by radiation in the diffusion approximation . here",
    "we define @xmath57 in terms of the @xmath0 cooling formula ( gammie 2001 ) , as follows . with @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath29 is defined as the ratio of the specific internal energy to the time rate of change of the specific internal energy .",

    "evidently @xmath57 is always negative with this formulation , i.e. , only cooling is permitted .",
    "it is important to note that in spite of the @xmath0 cooling formula , the disk temperature at a given radial distance from the central protostar is not allowed to fall below its initial value .",
    "this means that initially high @xmath10 disks can not become more gravitationally unstable solely due to cooling to lower temperatures than the initial state , regardless of the cooling parameter @xmath0 , and can only become gravitationally unstable by transporting disk mass such that the local disk surface density increases , thereby lowering @xmath10 locally .",
    "this assumption is critical to understanding the results to be presented for initially high @xmath10 disk models .",
    "this minimum temperature constraint was also imposed in all of the previous disk instability models in this series , and so was retained here in order to allow a direct comparison with those earlier models .",
    "a future paper will address the outcome of models similar to these , but where the disk temperature is allowed to cool below the initial value .",
    "an alternative justification for this temperature constraint is to consider the case of disks being heated by protostellar irradiation , e.g. , cai et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and takahashi et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , in which case disks might become hot enough to suppress fragmentation altogether .    the equations are solved on a spherical coordinate grid with @xmath60 or 200 radial grid points ( as well as the central grid cell , which contains the central protostar ) , @xmath61 theta grid points , distributed from @xmath62 , and @xmath63 or 1024 azimuthal grid points .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 are increased to their higher values once the disk forms dense spiral arms and the jeans and toomre length criteria begin to be violated ( see below ) .",

    "the radial grid extends from 4 to 20 au .",
    "the mass of disk gas flowing inside 4 au is added to the central protostar , whereas that reaching the outermost shell at 20 au loses its outward radial momentum but remains on the active hydrodynamical grid .",
    "the @xmath68 grid points are compressed into the midplane to ensure adequate vertical resolution ( @xmath69 at the midplane ) .",
    "the @xmath70 grid is uniformly spaced in @xmath71 .",
    "the number of terms in the spherical harmonic expansion for the gravitational potential of the disk is @xmath72 for all phases of evolution .",
    "the numerical resolution is increased during the evolutions in order to avoid violating the jeans length ( e.g. , boss et al .",
    "2000 ) and toomre length criteria ( nelson 2006 ) .",
    "both criteria are monitored throughout the evolutions ( e.g. , boss 2011 ) to ensure that any clumps that might form are not numerical artifacts .",
    "the jeans length criterion consists of requiring that all of the grid spacings in the spherical coordinate grid remain smaller than 1/4 of the jeans length @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the local sound speed , and @xmath75 the gravitational constant .",
    "similarly , the toomre length criterion consists of requiring that all of the grid spacings remain smaller than 1/4 of the toomre length @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mass surface density .",
    "when one of these two criteria is violated , the calculation is halted , and the grid spatial resolution is doubled in either the radial or azimuthal direction , as necessary , by dividing each cell into half in the relevant direction .",
    "mass and momentum are conserved by this process .",
    "once well - defined clumps form , the jeans and toomre length criteria will eventually again be violated at the maximum densities of the clumps , even with the @xmath78 and @xmath79 grids . at this point ,",
    "the cell with the maximum clump density is drained of 90% of its mass and momentum , which is then used to form a virtual protoplanet ( vp ) initially at the cell center ( e.g. , boss 2005 , 2013 ) .",
    "the vps thereafter orbit around the disk , subject to the gravitational forces of the disk gas and the central protostar , as well as those of any other vps .",
    "the disk gas is similarly subject to the gravity of the vps .",
    "vps that orbit to the inner boundary at 4 au or to the outer boundary at 20 au are simply removed from the remainder of the evolutions .",
    "the vps are allowed to gain mass @xmath80 at the rate ( boss 2005 , 2013 ) given by the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton ( bhl ) formula ( e.g. , ruffert & arnett 1994 ) :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is a dimensionless coefficient , @xmath83 is the vp mass , and @xmath84 is the speed of the vp respect to the disk gas .",
    "the vps also accrete orbital angular momentum from the disk gas , by accreting an amount of momentum from the local hydrodynamical cell proportional to the mass being accreted from that cell in such a way as to guarantee the conservation of the total orbital angular momentum .",
    "this insertion of vps in regions where the jeans and toomre length criteria can no longer be met is identical to the manner in which _ sink particles _ are inserted into adaptive mesh refinement codes , such as flash , when no further sub grids are allowed to be formed ( e.g. , federrath et al .",
    "2010 ; klassen et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "these models used @xmath85 in order to maximize the gas accretion by the vps and to minimize subsequent jeans or toomre length violations .",
    "if the jeans or toomre criterion is nevertheless subsequently violated in the immediate vicinity ( 10 cells ) of an existing vp , the violation is ignored , as the vp is expected to accrete or disrupt this high density gas .",
    "violations more than 10 cells away result in the creation of a new vp .",
    "along with the maximum spatial resolution required , the number of vps formed thus gives a basic estimate of the extent to which a given set of initial conditions leads to a gravitationally unstable disk capable of fragmenting into clumps .",
    "the models all begin from the same initial disk model as that used by boss ( 2001 , 2005 , 2007 , 2008 , 2012 , 2013 ) , differing only in the minimum initial toomre @xmath10 value and the @xmath0 parameter .",

    "the initial orbital period of the disk at the inner edge ( 4 au ) was 8.0 yr , whereas the initial orbital period at the outer edge ( 20 au ) was 91 yrs .",
    "the key point is that all the models were evolved far enough in time that there was no evidence for any further significant growth of non - axisymmetry , i.e. , no need to further refine the spatial grid .",
    "some models still required the creation of additional vps , but this was balanced by the loss of vps that hit either the inner or outer grid boundaries , indicating that a semblance of a steady state configuration had been reached . because the boss & myhill ( 1992 ) code employed has not been parallelized , each model was computed continuously on a single , dedicated cluster core .",
    "most models were run for as long as 2.3 yrs on the dtm flash cluster , while others were run for as long as 7 months on the considerably faster carnegie memex cluster at stanford university .",

    "models where the initial spatial resolution of @xmath60 and @xmath63 sufficed for the entire evolution without violating the jeans or toomre constraints experienced little growth of non - axisymmetry ( red dots ) , while those that needed to be refined to @xmath78 with @xmath63 experienced moderate growth ( green dots ) , and those that ended with @xmath78 and @xmath79 experienced significant growth of spiral arms ( blue dots ) .",
    "the remaining models continued to violate the jeans or toomre criteria , even with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , necessitating the creations of vps at the location of the violations .",
    "the black symbols in figure 4 represent the maximum number of vps created for those models , ranging from a black circle for a single vp , to a bar for two vps , to a three - pointed star for three vps , etc .",

    "this somewhat surprising result means that if a disk is initially extremely gravitationally unstable , self - gravitating clumps can form rapidly without being stifled by compressional heating during their assembly .",
    "however , the time at which the first vp formed depended strongly on the value of @xmath0 , with the first vp in models 1.3 - 1 and 1.3 - 3 forming after 104 yrs and 118 yrs , respectively , compared to forming only after 190 yrs and 212 yrs , respectively , for models 1.3 - 50 and 1.3 - 100 . clearly even for an initially highly unstable disk ,",
    "the cooling rate affects the time evolution of the fragmentation process . at the same time , the models starting with @xmath104 show that such an initially gravitationally stable disk can not become non - axisymmetric enough to undergo fragmentation , even for @xmath105 . as noted previously , this result is largely a result of the constraint that the disk temperatures can not drop below their initial values , in spite of vigorous cooling , and can only become more gravitationally unstable by increasing the disk surface density in a limited region of the disk , e.g. , by forming a ring . for initial toomre @xmath10 values in between these two extremes ,",
    "the general result is a smooth progression toward more of a tendency toward fragmentation at a fixed value of @xmath0 ( e.g. , for @xmath0 = 3 and 10 as @xmath2 is lowered ) .",
    "however , the transition from stable to unstable with regard to forming vps is not necessarily completely monotonically dependent on @xmath2 ( i.e. , for @xmath0 = 1 and 100 , where as @xmath2 is decreased , successive models can fragment and then resist fragmentation , before eventually fragmenting again ) .",
    "this result demonstrates the stochastic nature of gravitationally unstable disks , where the spiral arms that form repeatedly and interact with each other may or may not happen to combine in a constructive wave sense and form a clump dense enough to require the creation of a vp .",
    "given this ambiguity , the critical value for fragmentation appears to be @xmath106 for @xmath107 , @xmath108 for @xmath109 , and @xmath110 for @xmath111 , roughly speaking .",
    "figure 5 presents the final midplane density distributions for the four models at the extremes of the parameter space investigated , namely models 1.3 - 1 , 1.3 - 100 , 2.7 - 1 , and 2.7 - 100 .",
    "the two models with @xmath2 = 1.3 both clearly formed numerous spiral arms and clumps , regardless of whether @xmath0 = 1 or 100 , though in the latter case the spiral arms are broader and nowhere near as sharply defined .",

    ", figure 6c shows that model 2.7 - 1 maintains a disk temperature essentially unchanged from its initial conditions , as a result of the rapid cooling , whereas in figure 6d , model 2.7 - 100 shows several distinct rings of somewhat hotter gas than the initial temperature distribution .",
    "figure 7 shows the location of the nine vps still active in model 1.3 - 1 at the end of the evolution ( 224 yrs ) , the same time as the midplane density contours shown in figure 5a .",
    "it is evident that the nine vps are not aligned with the numerous spiral arm features seen in figure 5a , as is to be expected , given that the vps begin their existence with an initial mass of the order of a fraction of a jupiter mass , and as such are not subject to the tendency for gas drag to force small ( e.g. , cm - size ) particles to remain in the vicinity of spiral arms ( e.g. , boss 2013 , 2015 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the ensemble of vps formed in the eight models with @xmath2 = 1.3 is presented in figure 8 , sampled roughly every 40,000 time steps . starting with masses only a small fraction of a jupiter mass , the vps accrete mass at the blh rate and",
    "soon reach masses as high as 5 @xmath8 .",
    "the vps tend to be created in the sweet spot between 6 au and 10 au , where the disk is cool enough and massive enough to support the growth of strong spiral arms .",
    "once formed there , the vps can migrate through disk interactions ( e.g. , boss 2013 ) both inwards and outwards , with significant numbers hitting either the inner or outer disk boundaries and thereafter being removed from the calculations .",
    "finally , figure 9 compares the vps formed in the @xmath2 = 1.3 models with the presently known distribution in mass and semi - major axis of exoplanets between 4 au and 20 au .",
    "while not intended to be a rigorous exoplanet population synthesis on a par with those presented in section 2.5 , figure 9 hints that the disk instability mechanism may be able to crudely match the exoplanet demographics for gas giants with semi - major axes of 4 au to 6 au , and if so , this approach would predict an as yet mostly undetected significant population of jupiter - mass gas giants orbiting at distances of about 6 au to 16 au . refining the implications of these disk instability models for explaining the known exoplanet demographics , and for predicting what more might be discovered by future exoplanet surveys",

    "figure 10 displays the radial profile of @xmath10 in model 1.3 - 1 at the time ( 104 yrs ) when a vp needed to be inserted into the calculation : it can be seen that the minimum azimuthally averaged value of @xmath10 at that time was 0.61 , seemingly in remarkable agreement with the results of takahashi et al .",
    "however , for the seven other models with @xmath101 , the equivalent minimum @xmath10 value ranges from 0.69 to 1.0 . given that these are azimuthally averaged @xmath10 values , however , the basic agreement with takahashi et al .",
    "( 2016 ) holds .",
    "in fact , the first vp in model 1.3 - 1 was inserted at 7.2 au , the radius of the innermost local minimum in the azimuthally averaged @xmath10 seen in figure 10 .",
    "the @xmath10 value of the actual midplane grid cell where this first vp was inserted was @xmath114 , considerably lower still .",
    "the present set of models has shown that the disk instability mechanism for gas giant planet formation depends even more strongly on the initial conditions assumed in the models than on the assumed disk cooling rate @xmath0 , based on a suite of 3d models with identical handling of the spatial resolution of the grid .",
    "hence the evolution of protoplanetary disks into gravitationally unstable configurations is as important a factor to consider as the detailed heating and cooling processes in the disks .",
    "the models imply that if a significant fraction of protoplanetary disks can form that are similar to those assumed here , then there should be an equally significant population of gas giants remaining to be discovered with separations of order 15 au from solar - type stars .",
    "the nasa wfirst mission may very well test this prediction , based on a combination of exoplanet searches by gravitational microlensing and by coronagraphic direct imaging .    in order to help determine what is the proper value of @xmath0 to use in disk instability models",
    ", the author is currently running a suite of eight flux - limited diffusion approximation ( flda ) models similar to the present suite , with initial minimum @xmath10 values ranging from 1.3 to 2.7 , and with the same approach of adding spatial resolution and vps when demanded by the jeans and toomre criteria , with the goal of comparing these results for varied beta cooling models with those of flda models , for the same spatial resolution and same initial conditions ( i.e. , initial toomre @xmath10 ) .",
    "previous flda disk instability models by boss ( 2008 , 2012 ) used different spatial resolutions than the present models and so can not be used for a valid comparison .",
    "however , the suite of models currently running will allow the proper value of @xmath0 that should be used in disk instability models to be determined , as opposed to determining the critical value of @xmath0 for fragmentation for a given initial disk model , which was the goal of the present work .    in order to better understand the approach to gravitational instability ,",
    "a second set of eight models with the @xmath0 cooling approximation is also currently underway .",
    "these models all start from the same @xmath115 model as in this paper , and with same range of eight @xmath0 values as here , but with the minimum disk temperature values all relaxed to 40 k ( i.e. , relaxed to the outer disk minimum temperature for the highly unstable models with initial @xmath112 ) .",
    "these models will thus study the effect of varied cooling rates on the approach to a gravitationally unstable phase of disk evolution .",
    "i thank the referee , richard durisen , for a number of perceptive and constructive comments on the manuscript , and sandy keiser for computer systems support .",
    "the calculations were performed primarily on the flash cluster at dtm and also on the carnegie memex cluster at stanford university .",
