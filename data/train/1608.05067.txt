    "the importance of the concept of quantum statistics for our understanding of observed collective phenomena in nature can not be overstated . while fermions stack according to the pauli principle to form a fermi sea , with its implications for atomic structure , conduction bands in solids , etc .",
    ", bosons can sit together to display amplified single - particle behavior such as bose  einstein condensation and coherent propagation of light . upon restricting to two spatial dimensions on the other hand",
    ", it turns out to be logically conceivable to have other types of identical particles than bosons and fermions , satisfying braid statistics instead of permutation statistics , and which have been given the name _ anyons _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these have the property that under _ continuous _ exchange of two particles their wave function changes not merely by a sign @xmath0 , but _ any _ complex phase factor @xmath1 is allowed , where the real number @xmath2 is known as their _ statistics parameter_. moreover , for logical consistency one has to keep track of any topological winding of the particles during their exchange .",
    "for instance , if one particle encloses @xmath3 other particles in a complete ( counterclockwise ) loop , a phase @xmath4 must arise , while if two particles are exchanged once and in the process @xmath3 other particles are enclosed , the phase must be @xmath5 .",
    "all complications vanish in the case of @xmath6 ( bosons ) and @xmath7 ( fermions ) .",
    "the concept has also been extended from phases ( abelian ) to unitary matrices ( non - abelian ) , but we shall here stick to the simpler ( though not at all simple ) abelian case .",
    "furthermore , instead of demanding that the wave function changes its phase according to the above form of topological boundary conditions , also known as the _ anyon gauge picture _",
    ", one may equivalently model such phases by means of attaching magnetic flux to ordinary identical particles , i.e. bosons or fermions , resulting in a magnetic many - body interaction .",
    "this is then called the _ magnetic gauge picture _ for anyons .",
    "we refer to the extensive reviews @xcite for a more complete background on the topic .",
    "the idea of particles with attached magnetic flux is fundamental to the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite , which is a manifestation of a strongly correlated many - body state of electrons subject to planar confinement and a strong transverse magnetic field .",
    "more recently it has been proposed that similar effects apply to trapped bosonic atoms in artificial magnetic fields @xcite , and to graphene @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticles arising in the fqhe of electrons are predicted to be anyons with a corresponding fractional statistics parameter .",
    "however , as discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  9.8.2 ) , there has been much confusion in the literature concerning the exact values of @xmath2 involved .",
    "this can be traced to different conventions but also to the fact that the statistics parameter has hitherto only been defined indirectly via the operation of adiabatic braiding and the computation of a corresponding berry phase , as first outlined in @xcite .",
    "only very recently has an effective hamiltonian for anyons been derived @xcite , which shows unambiguously how they may arise in a fqhe context and what the statistics parameter then should be , confirming that fermions against the background of a fermionic laughlin state with odd exponent @xmath8 effectively couple to laughlin quasiholes to behave as emergent anyons with @xmath9 ( see also @xcite ) .    despite the concept of anyons having been around now for almost four decades , a satisfactory understanding of their physics is still lacking . due to their complicated many - body interaction ( or geometry ) it has not been possible to solve the anyon hamiltonian for its complete spectrum or even its ground state , except in the two - particle case where it can be reduced to a one - particle problem and",
    "thus be solved analytically @xcite , and the three- and four - particle cases where it has been studied numerically @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as is evident from the vast body of literature ( the author can count more than 300 papers on the topic ) , there has been a fair amount of progress on the many - anyon problem , most of which is based on various approximations .",
    "one of the most discussed is average - field theory ( see e.g. @xcite for review ) , where the individual anyons are replaced by their average magnetic field , something which is arguably reasonable in a dense regime .",
    "other approximations assume either a very strong external magnetic field , thereby reducing to lowest - landau - level anyons which turn out to be solvable with a connection to calogero ",
    "sutherland models @xcite , or in the case of the free dilute gas , that it is sufficient to only take two - particle interactions into account @xcite .",
    "it has however been stressed in the mentioned reviews that real progress in understanding the anyon gas can not be made without knowledge of the true many - body spectrum .    in a recent series of works @xcite ,",
    "the question concerning the many - anyon ground state has been investigated in the light of modern mathematical methods .",
    "interestingly , it was found that the ground - state energy for the free anyon gas can be non - trivially bounded from below , but only under the assumption that @xmath2 is an odd-_numerator _ rational number ( in contrast to electron fqhe which typically involves odd-_denominator _ filling factors ) . to settle the issue",
    "whether this is the true behavior or rather just an artifact of the method used to obtain the bounds , one also needs to bound the energy from above using suitable trial states .",
    "this however turns out to be a very difficult problem for anyons , contrary to the more common situation where finding the upper bound is the easier part .",
    "we shall here proceed in the setting of abelian anyons in a zero external magnetic field ( which is indeed relevant in the fqhe context ; cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) , and propose , building on @xcite , that good variational ground states for the many - anyon problem are given by moore ",
    "read and read  rezayi type clustering states that have already been studied for some time in the context of special ( proposedly non - abelian ) regimes of the fqhe .",
    "in particular , these types of states seem to give a much lower energy for even - numerator @xmath2 than for odd numerators , and offer a corresponding picture of condensation or a reduced fermi sea of anyons . in view of the above considerations , such a picture",
    "could in the context of the fqhe potentially have far - reaching consequences .",
    "for concreteness and for easier comparison with the results which are available in the literature , we consider as our starting point anyons confined in a harmonic oscillator potential . in the magnetic gauge , the hamiltonian operator for @xmath10 non - relativistic ideal anyons with mass @xmath11 in a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath12 , and in units such that @xmath13 , is @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the magnetically coupled momentum operator of particle @xmath16 at position @xmath17 .",

    "2.2 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.1 ) for details ) .",
    "the case @xmath6 then corresponds to bosons and @xmath7 to fermions , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 the sobolev spaces of symmetric / antisymmetric square - integrable functions having square - integrable first derivatives . in the latter case",
    "we have used the singular gauge transformation @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and with the coordinates here represented by @xmath29 , to explicitly switch from fermions to their bosonic representation via flux attachment . the same transformation can be used to show that the full spectrum must be periodic in @xmath2 up to any even integer @xmath30 , by composing @xmath24 with @xmath31 which preserves symmetry . also , one could equivalently have chosen to model everything in terms of fermions with statistics parameter @xmath32 .",

    "note that for every finite @xmath10 , the ground - state curve is conjectured to be continuous in @xmath2 and piecewise smooth , however the number of such pieces grows like @xmath58 .    on the other hand , an approach that has been used extensively in the literature to understand the anyon gas",
    "( see the reviews and references therein ) is to employ the _ _ average - field approximation _ _ @xmath59 here it has been assumed that the anyons see each other via an approximately constant magnetic field @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the local density of particles , and hence they each have a lowest - landau - level energy @xmath62 . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown rigorously that such an approximation is indeed correct in the limit of almost - bosonic anyons ( i.e. @xmath63 ; see also @xcite ) in a confining trap , however one needs to be careful with what is meant exactly with the approximation and how such a limit is performed since strictly speaking the anyons can not be ideal but extended ( see @xcite and section  [ sec : extended ] below ) .",
    "also note that the periodicity for ideal anyons mentioned above is not naturally implemented in , so we must at least expect to replace @xmath2 with its periodization @xmath64 from .",
    "the main question raised from the bounds and is whether for certain @xmath2 such that @xmath65  most notably for even - numerator rational @xmath2 such as @xmath66 , for which @xmath67  and for particular states such that @xmath68 , the true ground - state energy @xmath69 could be considerably lower than the one expected from average - field theory . building on @xcite , we shall here explore the possibility that this is actually the case .",
    "in order to understand the origin of the peculiar dependence of the above energy bounds on @xmath70 , and of the form of the corresponding proposed trial states , we first need to briefly discuss the findings in @xcite of a local exclusion principle for anyons .    normally when one talks about an exclusion principle for identical particles one has in mind an occupation picture , where only a limited number of particles can sit in each distinguishable one - body state .",
    "the prime example is of course the usual pauli exclusion principle for fermions , although various extensions have also been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "sometimes the notion is generously extended to concern exclusion of coincident points in the configuration space , and anyons have often been pointed out to obey such exclusion , either because it is required for their topological definition or because their singular ( for ideal anyons ) magnetic interaction forces the wave function to vanish on the diagonals , just like fermions do by means of antisymmetry .",
    "however , note that such a notion of exclusion also applies to the hard - core bose gas whose thermodynamic ground - state energy vanishes in the dilute limit ( in analogy with the non - interacting gas ) in two and higher dimensions @xcite .    for anyons",
    "whose statistics is generated by a true many - body interaction ( or a very complicated geometry ) , a stronger notion of exclusion is required , and such a notion has been developed in @xcite in the form of an effective repulsive long - range pair interaction .",
    "namely , recall that the effect of the statistics is a change of phase of the anyonic wave function by @xmath1 whenever two particles are interchanged via a simple continuous loop in configuration space , or a total phase @xmath5 whenever such an exchange loop at the same time encloses @xmath3 other particles . on the other hand ,",
    "particles are also allowed to have pairwise relative angular momenta , and such momenta are by continuity restricted to only change the phase by an _ even _ multiple of @xmath71 .",
    "one way of viewing this condition ( in the magnetic gauge picture ) is that the many - body wave function is modeled as a bosonic ( or fermionic ) one and thus it needs to be antipodal - symmetric ( resp .",
    "antisymmetric ) with respect to the relative coordinate , hence @xmath71-periodic ( resp . anti - periodic ) in the relative angle .",
    "another way to see it ( in the anyon gauge or geometric picture ) is that the wave function is a section of a locally flat complex line bundle with the topological continuity condition that its phase around such a loop should jump by @xmath5 plus @xmath72 times an arbitrary winding number . assuming then that the relative momentum or winding is the even integer @xmath73 if the particles are orbiting in a reversed ( for @xmath74 ) direction in order to cancel as much of the magnetic or topological phase as possible , we arrive at a total phase @xmath75 times @xmath71 for the particle pair . in the kinetic energy ,",
    "any mismatch in phase of this sort gives rise to a centrifugal - barrier repulsion @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the relative distance of the particle pair , and we have taken the infimum over all possibilities @xmath78 and @xmath79 to obtain the lower bounds in terms of @xmath80 . in the case of @xmath81 being an arbitrary reduced fraction with an odd numerator @xmath82 and a positive denominator @xmath46 , it turns out using simple number theory ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) that this phase mismatch can never be completely cancelled , and in fact @xmath83 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath82 is an even number it is evident that cancellation is possible for particular values of @xmath3 and @xmath84 , and therefore @xmath85 . for irrational values of @xmath2",
    ", one can use that any such number can be approximated arbitrarily well by both even- and odd - numerator rational numbers and hence @xmath85 ( although note that a very large @xmath10 may be required in such a process ) .",
    "a geometric interpretation of the potential is that there is non - trivial curvature ( magnetic flux ) sitting at each of the enclosed particles but effectively seen at the center @xmath86 of the particle pair , and its presence is felt by the kinetic energy in the form of an effective potential .",
    "the situation is from this perspective completely analogous to that of a free quantum particle moving on a cone @xcite , here with its apex angle depending on @xmath2 and the number of enclosed particles .    in @xcite and",
    "@xcite it has been shown rigorously by means of a family of magnetic hardy inequalities that such an effective pairwise inverse - square ` statistical repulsion ' indeed arises in the many - anyon system .",
    "although the effect is in some sense local and weighted only linearly in the number of particles ( in contrast to a usual pair interaction ) , it is still of long - range type and sufficiently strong to produce a ` degeneracy pressure ' ( represented concretely in the form of lieb  thirring inequalities ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) and consequently non - trivial energy bounds such as for the ideal or dilute anyon gas in terms of @xmath70 .",
    "we also stress that the method used to obtain the effective pair potential , which was introduced in @xcite and developed to encompass more general situations in @xcite , is well suited for numerical investigations of lower bounds to the ground - state energy .",
    "in order to match the available lower bounds for @xmath69 from above , it was in @xcite suggested to study variational trial states of the form @xmath87 with @xmath88 a locally integrable regularizing factor , @xmath89 a suitable sequence of particle numbers and , in the case of @xmath2 being an even - numerator reduced fraction @xmath90 $ ] , @xmath91 \\prod_{l=1}^n \\varphi_0({\\mathbf{x}}_l ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while for odd numerators @xmath82 , @xmath92.\\ ] ] here @xmath93 are the pairwise relative complex coordinates with the usual identification @xmath94 , and we have grouped , or ` colored ' , the particles into @xmath46 different colors where @xmath95 denotes the complete graph over each such group of @xmath96 vertices = particles ( cf . figure  [ fig : clustering ] ) .",

    "furthermore , every particle has exactly one edge in @xmath135 going to exactly one particle in every other cluster , namely the particle of the same color , and this is what gives the orbital angular momentum contribution @xmath136 . in this way",
    "there is a natural cancellation between magnetic flux and angular momentum on the level of each individual particle , even in the case of odd - numerator states which however have some extra repulsion and possibly angular momentum coming from the slater determinant in .    in the fully clustered picture",

    "note that the role of @xmath140 is to regularize the singular short - scale dependence of @xmath125 arising upon bringing particles very close together ( the jastrow factor in @xmath125 diverges with each pair like @xmath141 ) , and in we have assumed that this has effectively removed the singular factor @xmath142 from within each cluster .    with the assumption that the total energy increases with the total degree of one - particle states @xmath98",

    "we expect that the size of clusters , i.e. the denominator @xmath46 resp .",
    "@xmath147 , dictates the energy of the regulator @xmath140 which therefore favors @xmath148 .",
    "also note that we can not shift from an even state to an odd one by extending the fraction by @xmath149 in this way , but one could certainly take @xmath149 to be even and thereby shift an odd state into an even one , and thus argue that the energy should then become lower ( consider for example @xmath150 instead of @xmath151 or , for @xmath7 , cooper pairs instead of a single slater determinant of fermions ) . to argue against this possibility we need to study the pairwise structure of the states closer .    first note that the pairwise relative angular momentum for any ( shifted or not ) even state @xmath152 always comes in multiples of @xmath153",
    "the statistical repulsion then always gives a positive energy unless for some @xmath154 @xmath155 which requires @xmath147 to be odd , so that @xmath148 ( and @xmath46 is already odd if @xmath82 is even ) .",
    "we also note that if any particle clusters happen to be enclosed in the 2-anyon exchange loops , they each contribute @xmath46 to @xmath3 , that is @xmath156 to the magnetic phase , and at the same time a matching @xmath157 to the relative momentum ( one @xmath158 for each of the anyons orbiting around the cluster ) .",
    "furthermore , on a scale such that a pair of particles has exactly one multiple of @xmath82 as orbital angular momentum , a full cancellation with the magnetic phase demands @xmath159 ( this is indeed an integer in the even - numerator case ) , i.e. about half of the particles of a cluster are enclosed .",
    "on the very smallest scales , i.e. much less than the average interparticle distance , we can accept some phase mismatch and strong repulsion , to be controlled by @xmath140 , in analogy with e.g. the hard - core bose gas whose energy vanishes logarithmically with low density in two dimensions @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath160 it is natural that as the scale then increases a bit we first see exactly one enclosed anyon , @xmath161 , of the @xmath162 cluster of which the particle pair is taken , and then additional full clusters on the scale of the average interparticle distance ( cf .",
    "hence this allows for a full cancellation of the phase over large scales in this particular state .",

    "based on the long - range local exclusion principle and further short - range magnetic bounds that arise only in the extended context , it was shown rigorously in @xcite that a homogeneous gas of such @xmath200-extended anyons satisfies in the thermodynamic limit ( on a box of side length @xmath207 and with fixed average density @xmath208 ) a universal bound for the energy per particle of the form ( and assume dirichlet boundary conditions ) here because , although the sequence is bounded , it has not yet been proved that a general limit exists . ]",

    "it was shown that for @xmath200-extended anyons in an external trap @xmath214 and in a limit such that the filling @xmath215 is high but the statistics parameter @xmath2 small ( almost - bosonic anyons ; see also @xcite ) , the average - field approximation is a correct description in the sense that the particles become identically distributed in a self - generated magnetic field .",
    "let us now introduce a convenient notation for an associated scalar ( super)potential ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath216 with @xmath217 and @xmath218 we then have the following property , which is essentially a result concerning supersymmetry of the corresponding pauli operator .",

    "note that @xmath231 and thus @xmath232 furthermore , @xmath233 where the fundamental simplifying identity used is that for any @xmath234 @xmath235 since @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",

    "note that these states are regular even without @xmath140 , since @xmath248 however , in order to obtain the correct balance for a low total energy , and to take the appropriate limits , we expect that an additional regulator is still necessary .",
    "in particular , in the dilute limit @xmath249 the jastrow factor describes an attraction which needs to be turned into a short - range repulsion , as illustrated by the below estimate .",
    "the proof is almost identical to that of proposition  [ prop : phi - bound - oscillator ] , where the use of the identity is replaced by proposition  [ prop : pauli - identity ] .",

    "with the ansatz given by the discussed trial states , we have reduced the problem of bounding the ground - state energy of a system of @xmath10 anyons with even - numerator rational statistics parameter to the study of the @xmath10-dependence of the quantity @xmath256 which is essentially the energy of a repulsive 2d bose gas described by @xmath140 but weighted by @xmath257 .",
    "one could try to estimate this using the techniques of dingle , jastrow and dyson ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "alternatively , monte carlo methods could prove useful in this formulation . in any case , since the weight @xmath257 is designed so as to cancel any long - range correlations by means of its clustering properties , and since the energy of a dilute 2d bose gas is logarithmically small @xcite , the discussed approach indeed looks very promising .    finally , let us remark that if these are indeed the correct ( approximative ) ground states for a many - body system of abelian anyons , then they could possibly also explain from a more fundamental perspective the occurrence of such clustering states in the fqhe ( cf .",
