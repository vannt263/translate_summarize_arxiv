    "emission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation due to transitions between the hyperfine states of neutral hydrogen ( )  @xcite has had a significant impact on our understanding of our galaxy and our immediate cosmic neighbourhood . at present , however , the highest redshift detection of 21 cm emission is at @xmath2  @xcite and only very shallow surveys @xmath3 of the whole sky have been performed  @xcite . in this",
    "_ article _ we would like to point out that it might soon be possible to perform blind unbiased searches for large objects , both virialized and collapsing , using 21 cm emission as their tracer .",
    "it has long been speculated that it might be possible to detect the onset of the epoch of reionization using redshifted 21 cm emission  @xcite and indeed , spurred on by the claim that the reionization epoch might have been at much higher redshifts ( @xmath4 ) than previously thought  @xcite , there has been much recent work on this subject  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has also been pointed out that the evolution of the spin - temperature , @xmath5 , prior to reionization might be such that the large - scale structure can be observed in absorption against the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at very low frequencies ( @xmath6 ) enabling accurate determination of a variety of important cosmological parameters  @xcite .",
    "our motivation is somewhat different : to map the large - scale structure ( lss ) once it has developed sufficiently for the spin temperature to be given by the kinetic temperature of the gas @xmath7 and @xmath8 , that is , using 21 cm emission .    for various proposed instruments ,",
    "our aim is to make conservative estimates of the number of virialized clusters that might be found in the range @xmath9 , and also collapsing objects with lower overdensities at @xmath10 .",
    "these higher redshift objects are the proto - clusters which would have formed virialized clusters by the present day and in some sense characterize the so called ` cosmic web ' of lss observed in cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "they are likely to be rich , but naively , virialized objects would not necessarily be the most obvious places to look for neutral gas since the process of virialization and the creation of the intracluster medium involves violent gravitational processes which are likely to strip neutral gas from the constituent galaxies by tidal interactions and ram pressure  @xcite .",
    "however , by virtue of their large overdensity such objects should still contain a substantial neutral component , probably larger at high redshifts than locally , albeit locked up in galaxies .",
    "the fiducial detection threshold that we will discuss in this paper will be @xmath11 of , which we will show could be possible on large patches of the sky ; it is worth pointing out that this would only require a cluster to contain 20 gas - rich spirals with masses @xmath12 .",
    "this is likely to be the case for many clusters .",
    "most importantly , in the context of this discussion , all the objects we will consider , both virialized and collapsing , will have angular diameters @xmath13 which will match the resolution of the telescopes and arrays with @xmath14 m baselines currently being planned to detect redshifted 21 cm emission .",
    "this will make them ideal survey targets since they would fill the beam , in contrast to ordinary galaxies at the same redshift whose signal will be substantially diluted and will most likely be below the confusion limit .    blind surveys for galaxies and galaxy clusters have been performed in the optical waveband for many years . the most recent galaxy redshift surveys ( 2dfgrs and sdss ) have yielded significant constraints on cosmological parameters via measurements of the power spectrum and redshift space distortions , as well as a wealth of understanding of the properties of the individual galaxies  @xcite .",
    "if deep redshift surveys using could be performed they would open up a new window on the universe which could have some technical advantages over optical approaches .",
    "in particular , using the flexible spectral resolution of radio receivers , objects can be selected using spectroscopic methods rather than , for example , photometrically from optical plates , making them flux limited over the specific redshift range probed .",
    "the structure of the selection function should , therefore , be simple to define .",
    "it should also be possible to deduce the redshift and accurate line - widths for individual objects allowing one to probe the underlying mass distribution directly and establish the precise selection criteria a posteriori .",
    "this could overcome some of the issues of bias inherent in optical surveys .",
    "moreover , potential confusion with other spectral lines is unlikely in the radio waveband since there a very few strong lines .",
    "a standard line of argument often put forward is that , the optical surveys are sensitive to the sum of all the starlight from the galaxies and could be significantly biased by the non - linearities involved in the star - formation process , while the neutral component is of primordial origin and hence is unbiased .",
    "this is unlikely to be completely true since the neutral component is also involved in these processes .",
    "however , observing the component is more than just another view of the same object .",
    "the halos of nearby galaxies extend out very much further than their optical counter parts , suggesting that the dynamics of the contains extra information .",
    "as with galaxies , the study of clusters has focused on the central region where diffuse hot gas is situated .",
    "this emits very strongly in the x - ray waveband and can also lead to fluctuations in the cmb via the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect . however , typically the core radius of the cluster is only about 1/10th of linear size of the object and 1/1000th of the volume .",
    "it is likely that the study of these objects using as the tracer will lead to new insights in an analogous way to galaxies .",
    "in particular many of the rich spiral galaxies are likely to be situated away from the core and there is also a possibility of a component of diffuse similar to that seen around individual galaxies .    at present radio telescopes which are sufficiently sensitive to map the sky quickly enough to be competitive with optical surveys",
    "do not exist .",
    "however , the next few years could see the start of development of instruments which are many times more powerful in terms of survey speed than those presently available .",
    "the square kilometre array ( ska ) ( see www.skatelescope.org for details ) is the ultimate goal of much technology development currently underway .",
    "although its precise design is still evolving , its projected specification involves a collecting area of @xmath15 , sub - arcsecond resolution , a large instantaneous field of view and significant bandwidth in the region where redshifted will be detected .",
    "such an instrument will have the ability to perform significant galaxy redshift surveys tracing over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "proto - types are being planned which would be around 1/100th of the full ska in area .",
    "searches for galaxies at low redshift , extending those currently being performed , would be an obvious possibility for such an instrument .",
    "our aim , here , is to discuss issues related to the design of such an instrument in the context of a blind survey for large objects at intermediate and high redshifts such as virialized galaxy clusters and collapsing proto - clusters which are , as we have already discussed the ideal targets for these surveys in terms of their size ; our conclusion being that the planned instruments will be sufficiently sensitive to perform significant surveys .",
    "first , we will discuss different proposed concepts for such instruments and perform a simple sensitivity calculation for the limiting mass ( @xmath16 ) of a survey assuming a fixed integration time .",
    "we will then discuss the possibility of detecting virialized clusters . in order to make the link with theoretical predictions of the number of dark matter halos , we need to make some assumption as to the content of individual dark matter halos .",
    "this is a very complicated issue and since we are , at this stage , only trying to make rough estimate of the number of clusters one might find , we will assume that there exists a universal ratio @xmath17 which relates the dark matter mass of a halo , @xmath18 , to its neutral gas component at a given redshift . this should be a good approximation in the mass range relevant to clusters , but is unlikely to be so of smaller masses .",
    "we will make various arguments in order to estimate this fraction . at each stage",
    "we will attempt to make conservative assumptions and therefore our estimate of the number of objects found in a given survey should be a lower bound . under these assumptions",
    "we can then deduce the number of objects that a survey might find using the results of n - body simulations .",
    "we then discuss some issues related to the design of the instrument , the survey strategy and confusion due to in the field .",
    "finally , we will adapt our calculations to compute the number of objects at turnaround and discuss issues relating to their detection    throughout this paper , we will assume a cosmological model which is flat , with the densities of matter and the cosmological constant relative to critical given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the hubble constant used is @xmath21 and the power spectrum normalization is assumed to be @xmath22 .",
    "these values are compatible with a range of observations  @xcite .",
    "a number of different concepts are under discussion which could make observations in the frequency range @xmath23 .",
    "the proposed instruments will , in fact , be sensitive to a much wider range of frequencies ( up to @xmath24 ) , but this is the most sensible range to discuss the detection of large objects since they will be close to , or completely , unresolved .",
    "the design features which are of interest to us here are the overall collecting area , @xmath25 , the aperture efficiency , @xmath26 , the instantaneous bandwidth , @xmath27 , the instantaneous field - of - view ( fov ) , @xmath28 , the longest baseline , @xmath29 , and the system noise temperature of the receivers , @xmath30 .",
    "the overall system temperature , @xmath31 , at frequency @xmath32 can be conservatively estimated by taking into account the cmb and galactic background t_syst_sys^rec+2.7k+10k(f408mhz)^-3 , in a cold part of the sky .",
    "we will focus on two different concepts which differ in the way they form the instantaneous field of view .",
    "firstly , we will consider a conventional interferometer similar to the allen telescope array ( ata ) , which comprises @xmath33 dishes of diameter @xmath34 . in this case @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the current design of the ata has @xmath38 , @xmath39 and it is likely that @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    ". the fov is set by the size of the individual telescopes and the synthesized beam size is set by the longest baseline .",
    "such a configuration would have a synthesized beam with @xmath43 at @xmath44 and a corresponding instantaneous fov of @xmath45 .",
    "note that throughout we assume a circular aperture , that is , @xmath46 , which should be a reasonable approximation .",
    "the other competing concept which we will consider is that of a phased array which could potentially have a much larger field of view ; the idea being to use very low cost antennae , arranged in @xmath47 patches of size @xmath48 , and form @xmath49 individual beams using off - the - shelf computer hardware .",
    "hence , @xmath50 and @xmath51 assuming that the patches are circular , from which we can deduce that @xmath52 .",
    "such a concept could have more than one instantaneous fov , possibly allowing for more continuous usage for @xmath53 studies .",
    "three possible scenarios for such an instrument are presented in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "these range from conservative , setup i , to speculative , setup iii .",
    "we should note that for @xmath54 , none of the above configurations come close to saturating the inequality on @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath49 should be taken as being a guide figure since extra computing power could increase this close to the maximum fov set by @xmath48 .",
    ".three possible sets of design parameters for a phased array . included also are @xmath55 and @xmath28 at @xmath56 , and the figure of merit @xmath57 relative to configuration described in the text . in each case",
    "we will assume that @xmath58 .",
    "this value , which is slightly larger than that conventionally assumed for parabolic dishes , should be possible for these arrays since they are much closer to the ground . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tab2 ]",
    "as is almost always the case , the observed quantity @xmath59 is not theoretically well understood .",
    "it is possible to make accurate predictions as to the clustering of dark matter , but the evolution of the gas is much more difficult to predict .",
    "therefore , we will introduce the empirical quantity @xmath60 which we will define to be fraction of the in a dark matter halo of mass @xmath18 at redshift @xmath61 .",
    "we anticipate that this quantity is likely have a substantive scatter @xmath62 , but we shall assume this is zero since estimating it would be futile due to the small number of the observations available at present , and any scatter is likely to increase the number of objects that are found in a given survey assuming that the mean value is correct .",
    "this is because there are typically many more objects just below the mass limit than above it .",
    "we will first present a simple order of magnitude estimate for @xmath63 and then go on to discuss the current status of observations .",
    "one can estimate the fraction of in clusters , @xmath64 , from that in a typical galaxy , by taking into account different mass to luminosity ratios , @xmath65 , of typical clusters and galaxies , and the fact that only spiral galaxies are @xmath53 rich . if @xmath66 is the fraction of spiral galaxies in a typical cluster then f_hi^clust~f_spiral(m / l)^gal(m / l)^clustf_hi^gal .",
    "[ hiest ] by considering the average properties of galaxies  @xcite , the value of @xmath67 is observed to be @xmath68 for a typical spiral galaxy at @xmath69 .",
    "the value @xmath65 of such object is likely to be @xmath70 , whereas that for a typical cluster is @xmath71 .",
    "it is believed that the value of @xmath72 , making @xmath73 .",
    "another approach is to compute the value of @xmath74 for a cluster by summing up the measured values of @xmath59 for the constituent galaxies and computing their line of sight velocity dispersion , @xmath75 , and hence their virial mass @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mean harmonic radius and @xmath78 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we should note that this is likely to under - estimate @xmath74 since it ignores the many gas - rich dwarf galaxies which are below the detection threshold of any survey .",
    "moreover , it also ignores , as does the order of magnitude estimate above , the possibility that there exists a diffuse component of such as the tidal plumes of observed in galaxy groups  @xcite .",
    "the content of the virgo galaxy cluster is the best studied  @xcite , but it is well known that this object is not completely relaxed ; it being comprised of three interacting sub - clusters , and so the computed value of @xmath63 is likely to be an unreliable statistical indicator of the global value .",
    "studies of the content of other clusters are much less detailed . the abell cluster a3128 has been surveyed for  @xcite . by co - adding the at the position of galaxies brighter than an r - magnitude of 16.2 , a total mass of @xmath79 was detected .",
    "@xmath80 for this cluster is @xmath81 estimated from the velocity dispersion and the angular distribution of the galaxies at an assumed distance of 240mpc . for the detected galaxies @xmath82 , compatible with our earlier order of magnitude estimate .",
    "a recent sensitive multi - beam study of centaurus a group has been made @xcite and this survey was able to detect in galaxies over a wide range of luminosities and , therefore , includes at least part of the dwarf galaxy contribution . for this group @xmath83 .",
    "many different arguments suggest that @xmath63 should increase with redshift .",
    "is the basic fuel for star formation and it is believed that for an individual object @xmath84 . since the global star formation rate is known to grow approximately linearly with redshift to a maximum about five times the local value at @xmath85 , it seems likely that @xmath86 ; an effect which may be even stronger within clusters .",
    "a related , but logically distinct fact is the observation that high redshift clusters contain a larger fraction of blue galaxies when compared to local ones  @xcite and also that they contain a larger fraction of spirals and a reduced number of s0s  @xcite .",
    "both these observed facts suggest that @xmath66 also increases with @xmath61 .",
    "hence , using the estimate ( [ hiest ] ) it seems sensible to deduce that using the locally observed @xmath87 is likely to be an under - estimate by a factor of a few .",
    "various estimates of @xmath88 appear in the literature and these can be used to gain some further insight into the issues under consideration here . by making observations of damped lyman-@xmath89 systems in an average redshift range of @xmath90 the corals project  @xcite estimate that @xmath91 . using the fiducial value of @xmath92",
    ", one can deduce a value of @xmath93 for the field at this epoch corresponding to a density of @xmath94 . using the recently published data from the hipass survey it has been deduced  @xcite that for @xmath95",
    "the value of @xmath88 is much lower , @xmath96 from which one can deduce that @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "remarkably this is approximately a factor 6 - 7 smaller than the estimated value at @xmath99 and is clearly compatible with our earlier remarks concerning the global star formation rate .",
    "moreover , the estimated value at @xmath100 is very close to the value we have discussed in the context of clusters .",
    "this would tend to suggest that the value of @xmath63 is only marginally lower in clusters ( say @xmath101 ) than in the field . since the clusters are a substantial @xmath102 overdensity in the dark matter they should be clearly observable in with an appropriate sized telescope .",
    "since we are only trying to compute a lower bound on the number of objects found in a given survey , it is reasonable to assume a value of @xmath103 constant over the range of masses we are considering and independent of redshift . if @xmath104 as discussed earlier for the various planned surveys , then @xmath105 for the dark matter and hence by computing the number of objects greater than this limit will give an estimate of the number of objects likely to be found in a survey .",
    "now , let us compute the number of objects with mass greater than some limiting mass @xmath106 between @xmath107 and @xmath108 in a solid angle @xmath109 , n(m > m_)=z ^_m_lim dndmdm , [ ndef ] where z=(1+z)dv=(1+z)f_inst / f_obs , [ dz ] is assumed to be small , @xmath110 is the comoving volume element and @xmath111 is the comoving number density of objects",

    "this can be related to the virial mass , @xmath80 if we assume an nfw function for the cluster profile  @xcite . in all the subsequent discussion",
    "we have made this correction using a concentration parameter of @xmath118 , in which case that from @xmath116 to @xmath80 is typically very small .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : hi ] , we plot @xmath119 per @xmath120 per @xmath121 bandwidth against @xmath80 for five different redshifts ( z=2.55 , 1.37 , 0.78 , 0.42 , 0.18 ) corresponding to frequencies @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 respectively .",
    "we see that there are @xmath127 dark matter halos with @xmath128 per @xmath129 per @xmath121 bandwidth for @xmath130 .",
    "there are very few objects with @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "larger objects with @xmath133 are much more rare for @xmath134 , but for higher frequencies there would still be many objects above this limiting mass . using the fiducial value of @xmath135 at @xmath56 , by referring back to table  [ tab : tab2 ] , we see that it would be possible to cover @xmath136 in @xmath137 days using setup ii .",
    "such a survey would find @xmath138 objects above this mass limit since there are @xmath139 objects per @xmath129 per @xmath121 bandwidth .",
    "we note that a similar survey would take only 90 days with setup iii and there would be twice as many objects found since it has a larger bandwidth . for the same integration time one could cover only about @xmath140 at @xmath141 and would find @xmath142 objects with with setup ii . at @xmath143 one would be able to cover more area , but there are less objects objects since the comoving volume is decreasing , and things are likely to be somewhat more complicated since @xmath144 objects would be resolved at this frequency . much less area could be covered to the same depth at @xmath145 and as we will discuss it might be that such objects are difficult to detect against the background since the beamsize increases with decreasing frequency .",
    "clearly , there is no point in searching for virialized objects at @xmath146 .",
    "we have also computed the same quantity as a function of @xmath147 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dn ] for different values of @xmath106 .",
    "we see that there are very few virialized objects accessible to observations with @xmath148 again suggesting that surveys which are intending to search for such objects are unlikely to find anything significant for @xmath149 .",
    "however , we also see that for the fiducial value of @xmath105 which we have been using , there are a wide range of frequencies for which one will find more than one object per @xmath150 in a @xmath121 bandwidth",
    ". many smaller objects ( @xmath151 ) are accessible at lower frequencies due to the evolution of structure .",
    "one can attempt to gain some understanding of the optimal design of an instrument and survey strategy by substituting into ( [ ndef ] ) for @xmath109 from ( [ rdef ] ) , for @xmath152 from ( [ dz ] ) , and using @xmath153 .",
    "one finds that @xmath154 where , can be thought of as the instrumental figure of merit which clearly has sensible dependences on the relevant parameters .",
    "this effectively quantifies how many objects one would find in a survey ignoring any potential systematics .",
    "alternatively , the integration time required to find a fixed number of objects is @xmath155 .",
    "it is clear that similar arguments can be made for a galaxy redshift survey and this would , therefore , also apply to the ska and other similar instruments .",
    "this formula should also yield important information when applied to surveys for other kinds of objects .",
    "the value of @xmath156 for the ata configuration discussed earlier and its value is presented in table  [ tab : tab1 ] for the phased arrays .",
    "this figure of merit has been normalized to the theoretical sensitivity of the parkes multi - beam ( pm ) receiver  @xcite , although we note that this instrument can only observe in a narrow frequency range around 21 cm .",
    "we have also computed this quantity for the lovell telescope multi - beam receiver and the green bank telescope ( single beam ) ; they are @xmath157 and 0.21 respectively .",
    "note that we have used the frequency independent @xmath158 to compute this quantity .",
    "we see that the setup i is about a factor of 5 more powerful than the pm , while both the presented ata configuration and setup ii improve on this substantially .",
    "setup iii is more than 500 times more powerful than the pm .",
    "for a phased array configuration @xmath159 and hence @xmath160 which represents the filling factor of the array .",
    "it is clear that , at least for unresolved detections and ignoring the issue of confusion , which we will discuss below , a totally filled array @xmath161 will perform the best in terms of having the largest number of objects above the detection threshold .",
    "this is because an array with @xmath162 has a much lower sensitivity to surface brightness temperature , than one with @xmath163 .",
    "such an array would be likely to have poor resolution particularly at low frequencies and would , therefore , make it difficult to make any sub - selection within the sample to cut down on systematics .",
    "it is possible that low resolution arrays could also suffer from confusion related issues ( see below ) .    assuming a virialized halo @xmath164 ( @xmath75 is the velocity dispersion of the object ) and if @xmath63 is independent of @xmath80 , then the multiplicative factor @xmath165 .",
    "since the integral in ( [ ndef ] ) is a decaying function of @xmath80 with negative power law @xmath166 , the optimal observing strategy would be to set the noise so that @xmath106 is that for which @xmath167 , that is @xmath168 , @xmath144 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 for @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath124 , @xmath123 and @xmath174 respectively , this being a simple consequence of the evolution of structure .",
    "we have presented this power law @xmath175 as a function of @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nn ] . we see that under these assumptions @xmath105 should be close to the optimal mass limit for @xmath176 and that lower limits , requiring deeper surveys and hence less angular coverage for a fixed integration time , are needed to be optimal at lower frequencies .",
    "we should caution that this is heavily predicated on the assumption that @xmath63 is independent of @xmath18 which we have already argued is unlikely to be the case and this would have to be taken into account before relying on such a calculation to set the depth of an actual observational strategy .",
    "if @xmath63 decreases with @xmath18 then this would mean one should perform a deeper survey than one would if it were independent of @xmath18 .",
    "suffice to say , if one has some idea as to the dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath18 , the method would remain the same , but with a different value of @xmath177 .",
    "observations using spectral lines are not typically effected by issues of confusion as can often be the case for continuum sources . however , in the current situation we are dealing with very large amounts of @xmath178 and very large beams .",
    "one has , therefore , to be careful to avoid making the beam size so large that a typical beam contains an amount of comparable to the detection threshold . this becomes more and more important as one makes deeper and deeper surveys , particularly at high redshift .",
    "as we shall see this is very sensitive to the small scale distribution of , but in order to make a simple estimate let us note that the comoving volume enclosed by a beam of @xmath179 and a velocity width of @xmath180 at @xmath181 is @xmath182 . since the comoving matter density is @xmath183 , this means that a typical beam volume contains about @xmath169 of dark matter and using our estimate for @xmath63 , about @xmath184 of @xmath53 .",
    "clearly this mitigates our earlier assertion that @xmath185 would be the best situation for unresolved detections .",
    "making @xmath55 sufficiently small as to avoid this issue is clearly another important design criterion .",
    "an interferometer or phased array would not , in fact , be sensitive to this smooth mass distribution , but rather to the fluctuations in it , which are typically smaller .",
    "therefore , the discussion above yields an over - estimate of the possible effects of confusion .",
    "the clusters have overdensities of @xmath14 in the dark matter and we have already pointed out that , so far as current observations can tell , the value of @xmath63 in the field is only marginally larger than that in a cluster , for example , in a3128 . even if the overdensity in were to be diluted to only @xmath186 , one should not have any problem in picking them out from the background with a telescope whose beam is approximately the same size as the object .",
    "velocity structure can only help in this respect .",
    "the problem is that for a given telescope the resolution degrades very rapidly as redshift increases .",
    "hence , if a telescope were to be ideally suited to detection of clusters at @xmath187 then by @xmath181 this would lead to a dilution of the overdensity by factor of @xmath188 .",
    "one can make an estimate of the rms fluctuation in the mass in a volume defined by the beam area and the velocity width @xmath189 by computing m_^2=z _ m_lim^ [ f_(m , z)]^2m^2dndmdm , where @xmath190 is the velocity width of the object and @xmath191 is the beam area .",
    "we see that in order to estimate the confusion noise @xmath192 one needs to know @xmath60 for all @xmath18 at the particular redshift in question , that is , we need to extrapolate our argument for @xmath63 down to the galactic scale and below , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we present the results for an experimental configuration similar to setup ii , that is , @xmath193 ( @xmath194 ) and @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) using the fixed value of @xmath197 in fig .",

    "this function yields @xmath197 and for @xmath200 , it yields @xmath201 .",

    "therefore , we can conclude that the confusion noise would be very much lower than the thermal noise value for the fiducial value of @xmath205 used throughout this paper . as one might expect things are more restrictive at @xmath134 .",
    "for the fixed value of @xmath63 one would be restricted to @xmath206 and if ( [ fhi ] ) were to be true the confusion noise would be comparable to the thermal noise at @xmath207 .",
    "one would be more likely to be effected by confusion noise for setup i due its large beam and less for setup iii and the ata since they have smaller beams .",
    "the majority of our discussion to date has focused on the possibility of detecting virialized objects .",
    "however , we have noted that such objects are likely to have had their content depleted relative to the field by at least @xmath101 during the process of virialization .",
    "it should also be possible to detect objects which are just beginning collapse , at turnaround , when they are just decoupling from the hubble flow .",
    "this could be more efficient at high redshift where there are likely to be very few virialized objects with @xmath208 and virialized objects could become confused if the beam is too large . at turnaround @xmath209 and by virtue of the fact that virialization has not yet taken place , it should be possible to use , with some confidence , the value of @xmath63 for the field at that time . assuming a linear rate of star formation between @xmath210 and @xmath99 , one can deduce that f_^field(z)(1.2 + 2.8z)10 ^ -3 , for the field .",
    "moreover it is possible that the velocity dispersion of such objects is much less than the fiducial value of @xmath211 used in the earlier parts of the paper for virialized objects .",
    "if this is so , the signal to noise for a fixed integration time on a source would increase .",
    "this is because the signal is @xmath212 for a fixed mass and the noise is @xmath213 .",
    "the typical value of @xmath214 for such a object is unknown .",
    "formally , the point of turnaround is defined to be that when the average velocity is zero , but the velocity dispersion need not be so .",
    "it will be governed by that of the virialized objects within the region which are in the process of merging to build up the cluster . in the subsequent discussion",
    "we will allow for @xmath214 to be a modelling parameter , but it is worth discussing various possible values that it might take .",
    "if the object at turnaround just comprises of two large objects which are collapsing together then the value of @xmath215 will be close to the fiducial value of @xmath216 .",
    "it is possible that such an object contains @xmath144 of dark matter and is comprised of @xmath14 smaller galactic - scale objects in the process of infall with masses of @xmath217 . in this case",
    "@xmath218 . or it could be that there are many more smaller objects with , say , @xmath219 .",
    "these possibilities are worth remembering in the subsequent discussion .",
    "we should note that the collapsing objects at @xmath220 are the proto - clusters which would have virialized by @xmath221 .",
    "if @xmath222 , is the radius of the object at turnaround then the radius of that object once it has virialized is given by @xmath223 assuming a completely matter - dominated universe  @xcite .",
    "corrections can be made to include a cosmological constant  @xcite and also dark energy  @xcite .",
    "similar relations can be derived relating the time at turnaround @xmath224 and that at virialization @xmath225 , and the corresponding redshifts , @xmath226 .",
    "@xcite give a detailed exposition of this model .",
    "the formula ( [ dndm ] ) applies to objects with an overdensity , @xmath227 .",
    "if one assumes an nfw profile function for the objects with @xmath118 , one can show that @xmath228 ; this relation is approximately true for a wide range of concentration parameters . taking the fiducial value of @xmath205 and @xmath229 for @xmath134",
    ", we see that @xmath230 and the corresponding value of @xmath231 which can be used in conjunction with figs .  [",
    "fig : hi ] , [ fig : dn ] and [ fig : nn ] to deduce the number of collapsing objects that would be found in a given survey , if one ignores the smaller correction from @xmath116 to @xmath80 .",
    "we see that there are @xmath232 objects of this size per @xmath129 per @xmath121 bandwidth . for @xmath146",
    "the value of @xmath63 is higher and hence there are about the same number of objects ; the increase in @xmath63 offsetting the smaller number of objects for a given @xmath80 . with this large number of objects and the large beams",
    "likely at this observing frequency , one might think that one would be close to confusion limited ( @xmath233 object per beam area ) , but the extra information provided by the velocity information should help avoid this possibility .",
    "given the larger value of @xmath63 likely for objects which have not virialized , it might be sensible to also consider the possibility of @xmath234 , for which the corresponding values of @xmath235 and @xmath236 are 10 times larger .",
    "we see that there are still numerous objects ( @xmath237 per @xmath129 per @xmath121 bandwidth ) of this size for @xmath238 , although there are markedly less for lower values of @xmath147 even taking into account the larger value of @xmath63 . achieving this larger limiting mass at @xmath123",
    "should be possible in a fraction of the time required for @xmath239 .",
    "we should note that at any given redshift the objects at turnaround will be larger than those which are virialized , but have the same overall mass .",
    "[ fig : thetap ] shows the angular diameter size of object with a variety of masses at turnaround .",
    "we see that these objects are larger than virialized objects of the same mass at the same redshift . at the high redshifts we are considering here",
    ", the objects still have a angular diameter less than @xmath240 and hence they are likely to unresolved by the instruments under discussion . at lower redshifts",
    "such objects would be resolved and it should be more efficient to detect virialized objects .",
    "we can adapt the earlier sensitivity calculation to an arbitrary value of @xmath214 and @xmath16 .",
    "in particular one can compute the @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 from @xmath244 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "we see that the survey rate is given by",
    "_ = r_800(800kmsec^-1)^1/2 . for an mass of @xmath16",
    "the required flux density is s_=s_800(800kmsec^-1)(m_^lim10 ^ 11 m _ ) , and the actual integration time required to achieve a @xmath247 detection of such an object on an area @xmath248 is t_=t_800(800kmsec^-1)(10 ^ 11m_m_^lim)^2 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath249 then we see that it would be possible to cover close to @xmath250 in a day of integration @xmath251 using setup ii at @xmath134 . since there are @xmath252 objects per @xmath129 per @xmath121 bandwidth above the corresponding mass limit then one would hope to find around 200 collapsing objects .",
    "it would take around 10 times as long to do a similar survey at @xmath146 and one would find approximately 10 times fewer objects taking into account the larger value of @xmath63 and the very much reduced number of objects with a given mass .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath186 objects in 10 days of integration time is definitely worthwhile .    neither of the above survey parameters are optimal .",
    "if we assume that @xmath214 is either weakly dependent on @xmath253 or not at all , then the optimal mass limit would correspond to the value of @xmath116 for which @xmath254 in contrast to the virialized case . assuming that @xmath255 , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : nn ] that the optimal values of @xmath116 are @xmath256 and @xmath257 for @xmath134 and @xmath174 respectively .",
    "the corresponding mass limits are @xmath258 and @xmath259 . for @xmath134",
    ", it would require 4.3 days of integration time to achieve this optimum depth on @xmath248 .",
    "there are @xmath260 objects per @xmath129 per @xmath121 bandwidth and hence such a survey would find @xmath261 objects ( which is more than the @xmath262 that would be found by mapping @xmath263 in 4.3 days with a limit of @xmath264 as suggested above ) .",
    "to summarise , we have shown that instruments likely to be built within the next few years have a realistic chance of detecting large objects , both virialized and collapsing , using @xmath53 emission as their tracer opening a new window on the universe .",
    "if a detection threshold of @xmath265 can be achieved at around @xmath266 then it should be possible to find a surprizingly large number of virialised objects .",
    "similarly , it should be possible to detect many objects at turnaround with @xmath10 .",
    "we have also made comments as to the optimal design of an instrument and the survey strategy for these applications .",
    "clearly , more sophisticated simulations of the large - scale distribution of are required , but we believe that the basic picture we have put forward is likely to remain .",
    "it is clear that the detection of the large number of objects , both virialized and collapsing , predicted in this paper could have a significant impact on our understanding of the universe . in the regime where one can optimally detect virialized clusters ( @xmath9 ) it should be possible , using the extra velocity information , to accurately compute the dark matter mass of each of the objects which are detected and establish the selection function . since the number of virialized objects is sensitive to cosmological parameters , accurate estimates of @xmath92 and @xmath267 should be possible .",
    "moreover , the properties of the dark energy may also be accessible to such an analysis .",
    "the nature of the collapsing structures for @xmath268 is also of significant interest .",
    "we have used all the available information to make estimates of the number of objects which would be found .",
    "however , we have also noted that these are somewhat uncertain , particularly the velocity structure .",
    "clearly the detection of a large number of objects will have a significant impact on our understanding of the distribution of at high redshifts and the on - going process galaxy formation .",
