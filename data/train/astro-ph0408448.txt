    "present and future cosmological observations enable us to constrain or rule out models of the early universe .",
    "for example , the observations made by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) already put some constraints on inflationary cosmology , @xcite .",
    "the observations are consistent with purely adiabatic perturbations with a scale invariant power spectrum , but some `` anomalies '' , such as the small power of the quadrapole and features in the cmb anisotropy spectrum , have been reported , @xcite .",
    "future cosmological observations however , will not only constrain current popular models of the early universe , they will also test models `` beyond the standard lore '' , such as models based on string theory , extra dimensions , etc .",
    "for example , alternative mechanisms to inflation have been proposed recently .",
    "in contrast to the standard inflationary picture , where density perturbations are generated during inflation and then stretched onto superhorizon scales , fields other than the inflaton field generate the initial perturbations in the new mechanism . in the curvaton scenario",
    "initial isocurvature perturbations are transformed into curvature perturbations by a subsequent decay of a second field .",
    "this field , dubbed the curvaton , is already present in the early universe but is dynamically unimportant during inflation , @xcite .",
    "another example is the idea of `` modulated perturbations '' , @xcite .",
    "according to this idea , coupling constants ( and other physical properties such as masses of the particles ) are functions of the vacuum expectation value of fundamental ( light ) scalar fields present during inflation . because of vacuum fluctuations in these fields , different regions in spacetime have different values of coupling constants .",
    "these fluctuations can be converted into curvature perturbations , for example during reheating which is not homogeneous in space if the decay rate itself fluctuates .",
    "note that both the curvaton scenario as well as the idea of modulated perturbations need additional scalar fields in the theory , which are dynamically unimportant at least initially , during inflation .",
    "in this paper we do not seek an alternative to the standard picture of how perturbations are generated , but rather investigate how far the stabilization of moduli fields can alter the evolution of cosmological perturbations generated during a period of inflation in the early universe .",
    "moduli fields appear in theories beyond the standard model based on supersymmetry or superstring theory . in some models",
    "they can be long - lived and the life - time can be even larger than the age of the universe .",
    "the prime example of a moduli field is the radion , measuring the size of the extra dimensional spacetime in brane world scenarios ( see e.g. @xcite for recent reviews on brane cosmology ) .",
    "one important property of the radion is that it couples explicitly to matter fields on the branes ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "depending on the details of the bulk geometry and the matter content on the branes , the coupling is field dependent and can become quite large .",
    "it is the coupling between the different matter forms to the radion which can lead to interesting consequences for the evolution of perturbations .",
    "furthermore , the radion can be short or long - lived depending on the stabilization mechanism . in the case of the goldberger - wise stabilization mechanism in the randall - sundrum brane world , @xcite ,",
    "the radion obtains a mass of the order of tev , which makes is short - lived , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the impact of radion stabilization on the cosmology and dynamics of cosmological perturbations .",
    "we consider both the case of a short - lived and long - lived radion ; in the latter , the radion will constitute some ( or all ) of the dark matter in the universe . throughout the paper we work in the randall - sundrum scenario , @xcite , because the coupling of the radion to matter on both branes can be quite large and new effects will appear ( see e.g. @xcite for the effects of the radion on the cmb anisotropies ) . in @xcite",
    "the radion and its rle in cosmology were discussed in considerable depth . here",
    "we take into account the warped geometry of the bulk .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sect : eom ] we will present and describe the low - energy effective theory of the randall - sundrum brane world .",
    "we then present the equations of motion for both background and perturbations . in section  [",
    "sect : radevo ] we will discuss the evolution of the radion and the different constraints on the theory coming from nucleosynthesis , overclosure of the universe and the amount of entropy perturbations generated . in section  [ sect : radstab ] we present our numerical results of the evolution of the curvature and entropy perturbations .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sect : radconc ] .",
    "the form of the low - energy action for the randall - sundrum brane world scenario , in which two boundary branes are embedded in a slice of an anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime , has been studied in the literature already , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . at low energies",
    "the theory is a scalar - tensor theory with specific matter couplings . in the einstein frame",
    "it takes the form @xmath0 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{1 cm } + \\mathcal{s}_m^{(1 ) } ( \\psi_1 , a^2(r ) g_{\\mu\\nu } )   + \\mathcal{s}_m^{(2 ) } ( \\psi_2 , b^2(r ) g_{\\mu\\nu } ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have allowed for the possibility of two matter forms , each of which is confined to the positive or negative tension brane .",
    "the couplings between the fields on the branes and the field @xmath1 are described by the functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the coupling to matter has some interesting consequences , the primary feature being that we no longer have energy - momentum conservation for each component .",
    "in fact @xmath4 where @xmath5 describes the particular brane in hand .",
    "note that the field couples to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and so there is no coupling to radiation .",
    "one defines the coupling functions @xmath6 the energy conservation equation  ( [ emconservation ] ) is modified in this theory because the masses of particles on the branes are functions of the radion , and hence can vary with time if the radion varies with time .",
    "alternatively , we could choose a frame in which the masses of the particles on the positive tension brane are constant .",
    "in this frame , the masses of the particles on the negative tension brane as well as the four - dimensional planck mass vary with time .",
    "we will study the theory in the einstein frame , because after stabilization of the radion the frames agree .",
    "one problem common to nearly all models with moduli fields is how to stabilize these fields .",
    "we shall include a potential of the form @xmath7 but here we note that the origin of such a potential might have to be derived from non - perturbative effects in the underlying theory . as we will see below , the mass @xmath8 is constrained by requiring that the field does not overclose the universe and also by nucleosynthesis .    finally , the couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 have the form @xmath9 the geometry of the higher - dimensional spacetime is encoded in these coupling functions . depending on the value of @xmath1 , the couplings can be quite large . for small values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the function @xmath10 behaves as @xmath11 , whereas one finds @xmath12 .",
    "the theory described above is a good description of the two - brane system as long as the energy densities on both branes are much less than the brane tension .",
    "all length scales considered should be much larger than the curvature scale of the anti - de sitter bulk .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed that kaluza - klein modes are irrelevant at the energy scales we consider .",
    "primarily we are concerned with the application to cosmology .",
    "we allow matter to be present on both branes , each with an energy density @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "we also include radiation with energy density @xmath15 .",
    "to end up with a realistic cosmology , i.e. with late time acceleration , we include a cosmological constant @xmath16 . assuming a flat universe , the equations for the background read : @xmath17,\\label{eq : rdot}\\\\ \\dot{\\rho}_m^{(i ) } & = & - 3h \\rho_m^{(i ) } +",
    "\\alpha_r^{(i ) } \\dot{r } \\rho_m^{(i)},\\ \\ \\ j = 1,2 , \\\\",
    "\\dot{\\rho}_\\gamma & = & - 4h \\rho_\\gamma + \\gamma \\dot{r}^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will define the density parameter for the different components by @xmath18 as is usual .    the equations of motion of perturbations in matter , the radion field and the metric can be obtained from the effective action .",
    "we consider scalar perturbations only in this paper and work in the longitudinal gauge , in which the perturbed metric has the form ( neglecting any anisotropic stress ) , @xmath19 the energy - momentum tensor for the two fluids has the form @xmath20 according to our assumptions , @xmath21 for both matter and radiation .",
    "then , expanding in fourier modes , the perturbation equations read at first order @xmath22 where we have used the abbreviations @xmath23    the fluids and the radion field exchange energy during the cosmological expansion due to the non - vanishing coupling .",
    "this is to be compared with the original curvaton scenario , in which the curvaton field decays into radiation ( and matter ) .    furthermore , there is also energy transfer between the radion field and the radiation fluid due to the @xmath24 interaction term .",
    "the decay rate is given as , @xcite , @xmath25 where the constant @xmath26 is determined by the number of extra dimensions and the compactification and is @xmath27 .",
    "we shall set @xmath28 for the duration of this paper .",
    "this means the radion has a decay time of @xmath29 thus for @xmath30 , the radion would effectively be stable over the lifetime of the universe .",
    "if we require the radion to decay before nucleosynthesis , then we need @xmath31 this would then require a radion mass @xmath32 , assuming the constant @xmath26 is of order unity .",
    "the radion stabilizes at @xmath33 so this gives a long period of radion domination .",
    "the evolution of the perturbation quantities is described in full by equations ( [ eq : pert1]-[eq : pert2 ] ) .",
    "however , it will be helpful for our understanding to recast these .",
    "in general , the density perturbations , @xmath34 , and the metric perturbation , @xmath35 , are gauge dependent .",
    "it is more common to work with gauge - invariant quantities .",
    "one important quantity , the curvature perturbation on constant density hypersurfaces , is ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath36 note that this differs in sign from some of the definitions in the literature . in addition",
    "we can define the curvature perturbation on uniform @xmath5-fluid density hypersurfaces as , @xcite , @xmath37 with this prescription , it is clear that the total curvature perturbation is a weighted sum of the individual components , @xmath38 furthermore , we are able to define a relative entropy perturbation between two components as @xmath39    to make some predictions about the behavior of the perturbations we work in the `` separate universes '' picture , which effectively allows us to ignore the spatial gradient terms . in the long - wavelength limit , the perturbed continuity equation becomes @xmath40 where we define @xmath41 if one rewrites equation ( [ eq : pert3 ] ) in terms of the total curvature perturbation , @xmath42 , it is relatively straightforward to show @xmath43 where the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation is @xmath44 and the adiabatic sound speed is @xmath45 .",
    "this means that the total curvature perturbation will be constant on large scales for purely adiabatic perturbations . in the context of brane worlds , where energy can be exchanged with the bulk space time ,",
    "this quantity is not necessarily constant ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to break this down further so that one may write , @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the adiabatic sound speed of the fluid and is related to @xmath48 by @xmath49 further , let us define @xmath50 so that @xmath51 .",
    "on superhorizon scales it is possible to write the individual perturbation equations in the form , @xcite , @xmath52.\\label{eq : zetaievo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given in equations ( [ eq : q1]-[eq : q2 ] ) with @xmath55 and similarly for @xmath56 . from this",
    ", one can immediately see that for non - interacting perfect fluids with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the individual curvature perturbations for each fluid remain constant on large scales .",
    "there is now large scope for the setting of the initial conditions of the perturbations .",
    "we shall assume that the initial conditions result from a period of inflation in the early universe .",
    "then , it is known that any light scalar field , @xmath59 , will pick up a perturbation , @xcite , @xmath60 where this is evaluated at horizon crossing for the inflaton field .",
    "this depends on the scale of inflation but if this is to be taken as @xmath61 , @xcite , this tells us that @xmath62 where @xmath63 is some initial scale to be decided in advance .",
    "we shall set @xmath64 in accordance with current observations .",
    "since we are dealing with linear perturbation theory , it is only the ratio @xmath65 that is important rather than their absolute values .",
    "in fact , in future we shall normalize the curvature perturbation and plot @xmath66 . note that these initial conditions are different from those chosen in @xcite where @xmath67 initially .",
    "for the duration of this paper we shall set @xmath68 since this will give the largest possible effects .    with this prescription ,",
    "it is worth discussing what we might expect to see . from equations ( [ eq : zetaevo ] ) and ( [ eq : deltapnad ] ) one can see that @xmath42 is sourced in two ways .",
    "firstly when @xmath69 , which makes the first term in ( [ eq : deltapnad ] ) non - zero , and secondly if there is an entropy perturbation present . for perfect fluids , @xmath70 will be zero but for a scalar field this is not necessarily the case .",
    "therefore we will always generate evolution in @xmath71 and thus in @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , our initial conditions , whilst adiabatic between the fluid components , necessarily produce an entropy perturbation between the radion and the fluids .",
    "this all holds without any couplings .",
    "one should add that since the total curvature perturbation is a weighted sum of the individual components , the effect of the scalar field on @xmath42 is very much dependent on its energy density fraction . during radiation domination ,",
    "@xmath72 which will be constant if @xmath73 this no longer holds . during matter domination",
    "it is then described by @xmath74 as one moves into the @xmath16 dominated phase this should then become constant again . if couplings are introduced then , from equation ( [ eq : zetaievo ] ) , we know that all the @xmath75 evolve . during the energy transfer between the fields , @xmath76 and we will also produce entropy perturbations . we should expect to see further evolution in @xmath42 , which will be dependent on the size of the coupling terms .",
    "if one includes coupling between the radion and radiation only ( @xmath77 ) , we should see an effect in @xmath71 , and therefore @xmath42 , as soon as the radion stabilizes , because it becomes the dominant component .",
    "all of its energy is transfered to radiation as it decays .",
    "once it has decayed , @xmath71 gives no contribution to the total .",
    "however , since there is no coupling to matter , the @xmath78 have remained constant and @xmath42 will return to this value .",
    "of course , this conclusion will be modified if the coupling terms are non - zero .",
    "before we discuss the evolution of the perturbations , we will consider the evolution of the radion during the inflationary epoch and the subsequent radiation and matter dominated epochs .",
    "we also discuss cosmological constraints the theory has to fulfill .",
    "we begin with the inflationary era .",
    "for definitiveness we consider an inflaton field confined to the positive tension brane and a chaotic inflation potential of the form @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the mass of the inflaton field .",
    "further , because we want to study purely adiabatic initial conditions between matter and radiation , we assume that during the last 60 e - folds the inflaton field dominated the energy density of the universe .",
    "we are not interested in the case in which the radion was the inflaton field . with these assumptions , there are three cases of interest . in the first case ,",
    "the mass of the radion is much larger than the mass of the inflaton field , i.e. @xmath81 . depending on the initial conditions for @xmath1 , the radion field could have dominated the initial expansion of the early universe . in the second case ,",
    "the masses of the radion and inflaton field are comparable . in this instance",
    ", the energy density of the radion must have been much smaller than the energy density of the inflaton to comply with our assumptions .",
    "finally , the radion can be much lighter than the inflaton field .",
    "let us briefly discuss the three cases separately .      in this regime ,",
    "the radion is very light compared to the inflaton field .",
    "its potential energy can be neglected and the radion field is driven by the coupling to the inflaton field only . as established earlier , @xcite , the radion field is driven towards small values .      here",
    "a period of double inflation can be realized , where each phase is driven by either the radion or the inflaton field . in accordance with our assumptions",
    ", we consider the case in which the second period of inflation , driven by the inflaton field , is longer than 60 e - folds .",
    "with this prescription , the radion and the inflaton field stabilize at the same time .",
    "this case is very similar to the second example , except that the radion now stabilizes much earlier .",
    "initially , it is possible that the radion dominated the expansion rate of the universe before settling into the minimum of the effective potential . in principle",
    ", the radion could have set up the initial conditions for a period of inflation .    in the following ,",
    "we consider a scenario where the radion decays well after inflation , which corresponds to the first case only .",
    "this ensures that the perturbations created during inflation are adiabatic as is the case in single field inflation .",
    "the behavior of the radion field depends on its mass .",
    "if it is very light , the lifetime can be very large and in fact , in this instance , we assume that the lifetime is much larger than the age of the universe . however , depending on the origin of the potential for the radion , it could also be very heavy . in the case of radion stabilization via the goldberger - wise mechanism the radion mass is of order tev . here",
    ", the radion decays into radiation and matter in the very early universe .",
    "we will consider these two cases in the rest of the paper .",
    "further , we need to make assumptions about where the matter fields are located . in principle , both the standard model particles as well as the dark matter particles can be located only on the positive tension brane , whereas there is no matter on the negative tension brane .",
    "alternatively , on can imagine the situation where only the standard model particles are confined on the positive tension brane , whereas the dark matter particles are confined on the negative tension brane . although mixtures of these scenarios can be imagined , in this paper we will allow only baryons to live on the positive tension brane ; the dark matter being made up from matter on the negative tension brane and from the oscillating radion field .    in order to make our study compatible with present day observation , we take values for the parameters as given by the most recent wmap data , @xcite .",
    "this means that today our universe should be almost flat and made up of @xmath84 furthermore , we ensure that matter - radiation equality occurs in the range obtained by the wmap team , @xmath85    nucleosynthesis makes excellent predictions for the abundances of the light elements and we require that these predictions are not modified too much .",
    "nucleosynthesis gives a constraint on the expansion rate @xmath86 at the time when the light elements form .",
    "if the particle masses change during the history of the universe , as is the case in our theory , this will influence the time dependence of @xmath87 and therefore the expansion rate at the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "the evolution of the masses is specified by the functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the requirement that any changes of @xmath86 are constrained by nucleosynthesis gives , @xcite , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the coupling functions at the time of nucleosynthesis and today respectively . a similar",
    "bound is valid for @xmath89 if some matter form is present on the negative tension brane .",
    "note that these considerations neglect variations in the reaction rates , which itself are functions of masses and therefore of @xmath88 if the standard model particles live on the positive tension brane .",
    "in contrast , if they live on the negative tension brane instead , the reaction rates would be functions of @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the constraint above is a rather conservative one .",
    "if the radion is light ( @xmath30 ) , we have seen that it is effectively stable over the lifetime of the universe .",
    "it can be shown , @xcite , that for a scalar field , @xmath93 , oscillating in the minimum of its potential , @xmath94 , the energy density scales @xmath95 in our case this would mean the radion , @xmath1 , behaving like non - relativistic pressureless matter .",
    "however , we also have the extra source terms , @xmath96 , on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : rdot ] ) that could amend this result .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath97 are damped by the hubble parameter and the energy density @xmath98 will scale approximately like @xmath99 .",
    "this means that the source terms will decay faster than the others in equation  ( [ eq : rdot ] ) .",
    "therefore , we should still find that the radion behaves like matter when it oscillates in the minimum of its potential , regardless of the new couplings .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical results .",
    "in fact , the couplings are most important for the background solutions as the radion rolls down the potential . in practice , this transfers energy between the different species .",
    "since @xmath1 behaves like matter when oscillating at its minimum , this allows us to investigate a number of possibilities :    1 .",
    "@xmath1 plays the rle of dark matter alone .",
    "2 .   @xmath1 is part of the dark matter with the remaining contribution from the positive and/or negative tension brane .",
    "@xmath1 is subdominant with the matter on the second brane making up all of the dark matter .",
    "stabilization occurs when @xmath100 and from this point @xmath101 ( which inevitably succeeds @xmath102 ) .",
    "therefore , one can not stabilize the radion too early as this would lead to premature matter domination .",
    "this means that the radion can not be too heavy .",
    "moreover , if the radion is very light , then the background dynamics are more sensitive to the couplings .",
    "this may result in too large an evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "some of this can be compensated for in the initial conditions , but in general we shall find it difficult to generate extremes of masses .",
    "if @xmath1 is to play the rle of dark matter , then its mass should be around @xmath103 , @xcite , to agree with galactic halo results .",
    "we shall take this to be given in this instance and match our initial conditions to the correct cosmology . the situation in which @xmath1 is always subdominant may be interesting because even though we can not see the field , its coupling to matter may have some interesting effects on the perturbations .    whilst it is possible to have dark matter in addition to baryons present on the positive tension brane ,",
    "the coupling function in equation  ( [ eq : ar ] ) is small in general .",
    "in contrast , it is possible to produce large couplings on the negative tension brane , as it can be seen from equation  ( [ eq : br ] ) .",
    "having studied the background evolution , we now turn our attention to the evolution of the perturbations .",
    "we first discuss the case of a long - lived , i.e. stable radion field , before we consider the effects of radion decay into radiation .      in the randall - sundrum model , the coupling of the radion to matter on the positive tension brane is never large , @xmath104 .",
    "in contrast , the coupling to matter on the negative tension brane has the property @xmath105 for small @xmath1 .",
    "this allows the possibility of generating rather large couplings . in our first example",
    ", we take the radion to be approximately half of the dark matter .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : msa2 ] .",
    "here we are able to generate couplings as large as @xmath106 and unsurprisingly , this gives some strong effects on @xmath42 .",
    "one sees that there are large entropy perturbations and some interesting changes in the individual @xmath75 .",
    "the most striking feature is that @xmath42 evolves to negative values .",
    "let us now consider a subdominant radion and examine the entropy production from the couplings .",
    "the results for this setup are shown in figure  [ fig : msa1 ] where we stabilize the radion at @xmath107 .",
    "the couplings can have important consequences for the background evolution if the radion is very light .",
    "these couplings dictate the evolution of the radion initially and push the radion up its potential .",
    "this can lead to a period of radion domination as it gains energy from matter .",
    "we find from our numerical results that if @xmath1 is to remain subdominant we require @xmath108 .",
    "once more we generate entropy perturbations .",
    "we have seen that for a long - lived radion its stabilization has some interesting consequences for the history of the universe . even if it remains subdominant in the background evolution , it is still possible for it to generate entropy perturbations between matter and radiation due to the couplings .",
    "we move on to discuss the case of the decaying radion . in order for this to occur before nucleosynthesis so that the universe is radiation dominated we require @xmath109 .",
    "this should give us a large period of radion domination which is followed by radion decay into radiation . in the case of the goldberger - wise stabilization mechanism via a bulk scalar field , the mass of the radion is of order @xmath110 and therefore decays naturally in the early universe .",
    "in some sense , it could be a candidate for the curvaton . here , however , we are concerned how initial perturbations from inflation are modified by the stabilization and decay of the radion .",
    "we will set the mass of order @xmath111 so that the decay occurs before nucleosynthesis .",
    "again , the background initial conditions are set to produce the universe that we observe today .",
    "as we have already discussed , @xmath42 should evolve when @xmath1 becomes dominant and then again at matter - radiation equality .",
    "if @xmath112 , then @xmath42 should return to unity .",
    "any deviation from this is down to the couplings to matter .",
    "this can be seen from equation ( [ eq : zetarho ] ) because @xmath113 and @xmath114 are constant .    in figure",
    "[ fig : msa2 g ] we stabilize the radion close to the horizon of the ads spacetime at @xmath115 to generate large couplings on the negative tension brane .",
    "one can see that the background dynamics are as expected and that the radion decays quickly into matter before nucleosynthesis this is ensured by setting @xmath116 .",
    "the @xmath114 are sourced when the radion is stabilized and then remain constant , whereas @xmath117 is sourced during the decay of @xmath1 .",
    "this is reflected in the not insignificant production of entropy .    by means of comparison",
    ", we show the equivalent plots in figure  [ fig : nocoupg ] for no coupling to matter . whilst the picture is similar ,",
    "we find @xmath42 returning to unity at matter - radiation equality .",
    "furthermore , there is less entropy production than before .",
    "in this paper we have studied the evolution of cosmological perturbations during radion stabilization .",
    "we have seen that stabilizing the radion field , which describes the inter - brane distance , can have non - trivial effects on the curvature and entropy perturbations .",
    "we have studied two situations , a long and short - lived radion . in the short - lived case",
    ", we allow the radion to decay into radiation only with the radion coupling to matter naturally . in setting the initial conditions for the perturbations ,",
    "we assume that our universe has already undergone a period of inflation .",
    "the scale of inflation determines the initial conditions for the radion in particular the amplitude of the field fluctuation with the fluid perturbations set to be adiabatic initially .",
    "this will naturally source the total curvature perturbation , since there is an initial entropy between the fields and the fluids .",
    "additionally , energy is transfered between the radion field and matter on each brane due to the coupling terms .",
    "this enhances the amount of entropy produced .",
    "the amount of entropy production coming from the coupling terms depends on the initial conditions of the radion field just after inflation as well as on the field value at stabilization .",
    "the evolution of @xmath42 and the @xmath75 and therefore @xmath118 are influenced by a number of parameters .",
    "the values @xmath119 and @xmath120 are important as they determine the size of the coupling terms @xmath121 . in addition ,",
    "@xmath122 and @xmath63 determine the initial entropy perturbation between radiation and the field which is transfered into part of the curvature perturbation .",
    "this is similar to the curvaton scenario .",
    "the difference here is that there is an initial curvature perturbation and even if the field decays into radiation only , there is still an energy transfer to matter via the couplings .",
    "the constraints on the theory come mainly from the cmb anisotropies .",
    "the effect of the radion on the cmb anisotropies has been investigated earlier , @xcite , but in this paper we have included an initial field perturbation , @xmath123 , set by the inflationary scale .",
    "the large - scale temperature fluctuation can be written as , @xcite , @xmath124 since the radion behaves like matter at matter - radiation equality in all cases we have considered . in this expression we have set @xmath125 and we neglect any neutrino contribution .",
    "observationally constrained is the `` effective baryon isocurvature perturbation '' , defined as @xmath126 where in this expression we have assumed that the matter on the first brane is comprised of baryons only . since the amplitude of @xmath127 as well as of @xmath128 depend on the details of the stabilization mechanism , such as sizes of the couplings during radion evolution and the mass of the radion , the cmb constrains these parameters to a certain extent , in a similar manner to the curvaton scenario , @xcite .",
    "it is possible to extend our work in several different ways .",
    "firstly , the initial conditions between the matter and radiation do not have to be necessarily adiabatic .",
    "in fact , the radion is a candidate for a curvaton field , if inflation happens at a higher energy scale than the energy scale of the radion potential . in this case",
    ", the radion field picks up perturbations during inflation which can be transfered to a curvature perturbation during radion stabilization . since in the goldberger - wise mechanism",
    "the mass of the radion is of order tev , this is a realistic scenario to be investigated .",
    "a detailed analysis would give constraints on the mass of the radion as well as on initial conditions of the field just after inflation .",
    "we note , that our setup is similar to the one discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , in our case the radion field decays into radiation only and is coupled to matter via the functions @xmath129 only .",
    "a second point to be investigated is the effect of the potential on the stabilization and on the evolution of perturbations .",
    "if the radion undergoes minimal evolution then any potential with a local minimum can usually be approximated by the expansion @xmath130 in this instance our results will should not change substantially . however ,",
    "if the radion evolves sufficiently such that the potential can no longer be approximated by the expansion in equation  ( [ eq : potapprox ] ) , then the energy transfer between the radion and matter can be significantly different .",
    "our work also has implications for other models such as those with constant couplings .",
    "if these couplings are large enough , the energy transfer between the modulus and matter can be large and an entropy perturbation will be produced , even if the field is subdominant throughout the history of the universe .",
