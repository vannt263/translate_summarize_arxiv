    "small - world network ( swn ) model proposed by watts and strogatz @xcite has recently attracted much attention since it can describe typical properties of diverse materials ranging from regular lattices to random graphs simultaneously by varying only a single parameter .",
    "most of the previous works have focused on the average minimal distance @xmath5 separating two randomly chosen points which describes how the distance is reduced by the rewiring of the bonds in the network .",
    "several numerical and analytical studies have investigated the crossover behavior @xcite , the scaling properties @xcite , and the percolation of the dynamic processes @xcite in this model .",
    "although the connection between any two vertices , no matter it is a regular link or a `` shot - cut '' , is treated as a classical one up till now , the model has shown its wide applications on modeling communication networks , disease spreading , and power grid , etc . to stimulate out new applications of swn in condensed matter physics , it is interesting to introduce quantum connections instead of classical ones among vertices and to investigate the properties of electronic states . by rewiring the bonds from a one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain with large coordinate number ,",
    "the lattice becomes random and its effective dimension increases .",
    "if the diagonal disorder is also included , it becomes a suitable model to probe the localization and delocalization behavior for realistic systems for which the backbones are 1d chains .",
    "the construction of a small - world network starts from a regular 1d chain with circular boundary condition , in which every site is connected to its @xmath0 immediate neighbors",
    ". then every bond starting from a site can be rewired with a probability @xmath6 , i.e. , to be replaced by a new bond from the same site to a randomly chosen site other than one of the @xmath0 neighbors . from the geometric point of view",
    ", the rewiring procedure introduces the topological disorder to the originally regular 1d lattice but generates many `` shot - cut '' paths for moving of particles , causing easier spreading of the states . at the same time the additional site - energy disorder trends to localize the states .",
    "therefore , there are two competing effects on localization properties of electronic states , one is the localization effect produced by the topological and diagonal disorder , the other is the spreading effect caused by the `` shot - cut '' links .",
    "in fact , such `` shot - cut '' links eventually lead to the enhancement of the effective dimensionality of systems in the case of large @xmath0 .",
    "thus , a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) can be expected by varying @xmath6 if the effective dimensionality exceeds 2 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate localization properties of electrons in such a disordered quantum small - world ( dqsw ) model , and to seek for the possible transition between localization and delocalization .",
    "we discern the localized and delocalized states from the level statistics method combined with the finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "we determine the transition and obtain a universal critical distribution of level spacing at the critical points , revealing the possible existence of mit in some soft materials .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in section ii we describe the structure and basic formalism of the dqsw model ; in section iii we show numerical results on typical level spacing distributions ; we present the scaling analysis of the level statistics for the phase transition in section iv ; and we give a brief summary in the last section .",
    "consider an electron moving in a dqsw network , the tight - binding hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath7 @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is energy level on site @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the total number of sites , @xmath0 defines the immediate neighboring range @xmath12 $ ] of size @xmath10 , @xmath13 is an arbitrary site outside this range and subject to the restriction that there is no repeated term in the sum , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are hopping integrals for  original \" and  rewired \" links , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath9 and @xmath16 are random variables satisfying the distribution probabilities @xmath17 @xmath18 thus , @xmath19 characterizes the degree of on - site disorder as in the anderson model @xciteand @xmath6 is the probability of a bond in the immediate neighboring range to be broken and rewired . by increasing @xmath6 the number of irregular bonds , which are also  short - cut \" paths for the motion of electrons , is increased , leading to the enhancement of both the degree of topological disorder and the effective dimensionality .",
    "actually , the present model provides a way to describe the random topological structures in some realistic soft materials . in the case of polymer , the intrachain winding @xcite could serve as possible rewiring mechanism , and both topological and site - energy disorder could exist .",
    "moreover , the circular boundary condition for a long chain which yields the circle structure of a typical small - world network is also applicable in analysis of the quasi-1d systems .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix can be diagonalized numerically to yield single - electron eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "it is well known that the levels of the localized and extended states exhibit sharply different level spacing distributions .",
    "the localized states have the exponential decay of the space overlapping so that their levels are unrelated . after unfolding @xcite",
    "the level spacing @xmath1 obeys poisson distribution @xmath20 when the size of system goes to infinity .",
    "meanwhile the extended states of consecutive energy levels have large space overlapping , resulting in a correlated energy spectrum with level spacing satisfying wigner - dyson ( w - d ) distribution @xmath21 .",
    "a dqsw system is characterized by the following parameters : the degree of diagonal disorder @xmath19 , the rewiring probability @xmath6 , the coordination number of the original 1d chain @xmath0 , the ratio of the rewired hopping integral to the original one @xmath22 , and the size of system @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , it is simply a 1d disordered model with circular boundary condition and all the states are localized . in this case",
    "@xmath25 exhibits poisson distribution . by increasing @xmath6 , the degree of the topological disorder increases but the probability for an electron to tunnel to farther sites",
    "is also enhanced , leading to the competition of two opposite effects for the localization .",
    "the including of the on - site disorder provides another mechanism of changing the balance of the competition . in order to obtain a quantitative description of the resultant effect of the competition",
    ", we adopt a scaling variable @xmath26 @xcite to depict the relative deviation of variance @xmath27 of level distribution @xmath28 from that of the w - d distribution .",
    "the variance is defined as @xmath29 and the scaling function is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the standard variance of w - d and poisson distributions , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath33 can serve as a measure of the deviation of states from the extended states . from this definition",
    "we can calculate @xmath6 and @xmath19 dependence of @xmath26 for given values of other parameters . to suppress the fluctuations in the results we take ensemble average over @xmath34 random configurations . for the sake of simplicity we set @xmath14 as the energy units .",
    "the degree of on - site disorder @xmath19 varies from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , and the rewiring probability @xmath6 is ranged from @xmath35 to @xmath37 . in the calculations we take @xmath38 or @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , or @xmath42 to check their effect on the localization .",
    "meanwhile the scaling analysis is carried out by varying the system size from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the level spacing distribution of systems with different rewiring probability and fixed values of @xmath19 , @xmath0 , @xmath15 and @xmath11 . by increasing the rewiring probability @xmath6 from zero @xmath25 varies from poisson - like to wigner - dyson - like for a finite @xmath19 , reflecting the delocalization effect of the rewiring .",
    "it is easily understood from the scaling theory @xcite that the states are localized for system with zero @xmath6 and finite @xmath19 because of its 1d nature . by increasing @xmath6 both",
    "the degree of topological disorder and the effective dimensionality of the system are enhanced .",
    "the results of fig . 1 indicate that the latter is dominant for @xmath38 , @xmath40 and the adopted range of @xmath6 .",
    "the appearance of the extended states is possible if the effective dimensionality exceeds 2 .",
    "although fig .",
    "1 only shows the behavior of system with fixed size , the typical w - d form of the distributions for @xmath45 suggests the extended nature of the states .",
    "we will carry out the scaling analysis to check the existence of mit .",
    "note that the crossing point @xmath46 of the curves is independent of the parameters , suggesting the applicability of the level statistics for the present model .",
    "the values of other parameters , such as @xmath0 and @xmath15 , also have crucial effect on the localization behavior of the states . generally speaking , increasing the coordinate number @xmath0",
    "will accelerate the tendency of delocalization in increasing @xmath6 from zero .",
    "it is difficult to find the extended states if @xmath47 . the value of @xmath15 , the hopping intensity of the rewired bonds , has similar effect on the localization effect of the states .",
    "the extended states can not be found if @xmath15 is too small .",
    "the degree of topological disorder is enhanced by decreasing the ratio @xmath22 from 1 .",
    "thus , in increasing @xmath6 the effect of enlarging effective dimensionality may be cancelled by the increase of the disorder . at this point",
    "the dqsw model is essentially different from the classical swn , in which the properties depend only on the structural parameters . in fig .",
    "2 we plot the dependence of scaling variable @xmath33 on parameters @xmath19 and @xmath6 for various system sizes and other choices of @xmath0 and @xmath15 .",
    "it can be seen from the main panel that @xmath26 varies monotonically with increase of @xmath19 for all the investigated system sizes , reflecting the trivial localization effect of the on - site disorder as in other models .",
    "although @xmath33 is certainly near zero for small @xmath19 , @xmath26 still decreases by increasing the system size , suggesting the absence of the extended states in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "this implies that for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the effective dimensionality could not exceed 2 . from the inset",
    "it can be seen that the effect of @xmath6 is rather nontrivial in the case of @xmath51 and @xmath48 . since the rewired links have much weaker hopping strength than the original ones , the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath26 is no longer monotonous .",
    "it first decreases with @xmath6 and reaches a minimum value @xmath52 at a medium value @xmath53 , then increases and finally drop down again near @xmath54 .",
    "this behavior is not changed by changing the system size .",
    "when @xmath6 is small ( @xmath55 ) , the increase of @xmath6 creates the long - range hopping paths and causes the states to be more expanded . for large @xmath6",
    "the hopping strength of the rewired links becomes important and by increasing @xmath6 more bonds with large hopping intensity are converted to ones with small hopping intensity .",
    "this enhances the localization trend and increases the value of @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath6 is near 1 , the structure approaches to the limit of a random graph in which the 1d backbone completely disappears and the original links with @xmath56 are almost absent . in this case",
    "the increase of long - range paths can result in the increase of @xmath26 .",
    "all the states are still localized as shown from the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath26 . from comparison of the inset and the main panel , the value of @xmath33 is increased by decreasing @xmath15 from 0.3 to 0.1 .",
    "it should be stressed that the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath33 is sensitive to the value of @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath57 @xmath33 is monotonically increased with @xmath6 because by increasing @xmath6 more bonds are converted from weak hopping to strong hopping .",
    "in a new version of small - world model proposed by newman and wattz @xcite , the length scale @xmath58 defined as @xmath59 for the 1d underlying lattice governs the features of a number of quantities , such as the mean distance of pairs of vertices , the effective dimension @xmath60 , etc . in their model @xmath60",
    "is a size - dependent quantity and related to the length scale in the form @xmath61 . in the quantum version of small - world network",
    ", @xmath6 still plays an important role in determine the localization properties of electrons , although we adopt the structure of the earlier version of the model proposed in @xcite and include the diagonal disorder .",
    "one can conjecture that by the random rewiring procedure the effective dimension is still related to @xmath0 and @xmath6 , although the relation @xmath62 may no longer be valid . in this sense for large @xmath0 and suitable @xmath6 the effective dimensionality of dqsw can exceed @xmath63 .",
    "one could predict the occurrence of mit in such systems without violating the scaling hypothesis .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath26 for systems with varying size ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) and with parameters @xmath66 , @xmath38 and @xmath67 .",
    "the curves corresponding to different system sizes are crossed at point @xmath68 for which @xmath69 is size - independent and equal to @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 can be regarded as the transition point separating the localization regime ( @xmath72 ) and delocalization regime ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we also find that this transition can occur in a range of @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath19 dependence of @xmath74 in @xmath75 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "@xmath71 increases with @xmath19 as can be expected from the trivial effect of @xmath19 .",
    "the values of @xmath33 shown in fig .",
    "3 as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath76 can be fitted with a one - parameter scaling function @xmath77 where @xmath78 can be regarded as the localization length in the localized regime and the correlation length in the delocalized regime .",
    "we set up the value of @xmath78 in such a way that all the @xmath79 - @xmath80 curves from the data of fig .",
    "3 can collapse in a common curve representing the function @xmath81 . in the inset of fig .",
    "4 we plot this function .",
    "it can be seen that the curve consists of two branches : the upper branch corresponds to the localization regime ( @xmath82 ) and the lower branch stands for the delocalization regime ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath84 is singular at the transition point @xmath71 .",
    "this singularity can be expressed by a power law with exponent @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a constant . by fitting the data we obtain that the exponent is equal to @xmath88 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the level statistics at the critical points . for this purpose",
    "it is more convenient to consider the cumulative level spacing distribution function defined in the form @xcite @xmath89 . from this definition",
    "one has @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the poisson and w - d distributions , respectively . to demonstrate the universal feature of the distribution at the critical points , in fig .",
    "4 we plot the @xmath92-@xmath1 curves for parameters in the localization and delocalization regimes and at the critical points .",
    "we find that in the range of @xmath93 all the curves corresponding to the critical points for various values of @xmath11 and @xmath19 coincide with a common straight line which can fitted by @xmath94 with coefficient @xmath95 and exponent @xmath96 independent of the values of @xmath19 and @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath97 the critical distribution @xmath98 is similar to the poisson distribution in the tail of large @xmath1 .",
    "this feature of the critical distribution at large @xmath1 has been obtained in the anderson transition in system of very large size @xcite . in the range @xmath99 ,",
    "the curves @xmath92-@xmath1 for the critical points is deviated from the straight line and approaches to a function of the form of eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) but with @xmath100 greater than 1 .",
    "this is a behavior that interpolates between poisson and w - d distributions .",
    "such a universal form for the critical points provides the further evidence for the existence of the transition in the dqsw system .",
    "moreover , it is a successful practice of the new method using the level statistics combined with the finite size scaling analysis proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the localization - delocalization transition in systems with complicated structures .",
    "we have investigated the small - world model in the viewpoint of quantum hamiltonian with the primary topological disorder in the network and the additional diagonal disorder . similarly to the case of the earlier works which focus on the classical behavior of this structure , we find that the rewiring procedure with probability @xmath6 not only introduces the topological disorder , but also enlarges the effective dimensionality of the system . as a result of the competition between these two effects , the system undergoes a metal - insulator phase transition by varying @xmath6 . by using the method of level statistics combined with the finite size scaling analysis , we have determined the @xmath19-dependent transition point @xmath71 in the dqsw system .",
    "it corresponds to a transition of the level distribution @xmath25 from the poisson - like form to the wigner - dyson - like form . for this transition a two - branch scaling function",
    "is obtained . the calculated critical point @xmath74 increases with increasing the diagonal disorder @xmath19 .",

    "the existence of such a transition depends crucially on values of other parameters such as @xmath0 and @xmath15 .",
    "when the hopping intensity of rewired bonds @xmath102 is too small , the disorder effect of the rewiring process becomes dominant and no extended states can be found .",
