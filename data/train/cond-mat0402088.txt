    "the local magnetization dynamics in a bulk ferromagnet are usually well described by a phenomenological model formulated in terms of three parameters : @xmath0 , an effective magnetic field ; @xmath1 , a gyromagnetic ratio ; and @xmath2 , a gilbert - damping constant .",
    "the field @xmath0 is a sum of contributions from externally applied fields , crystal anisotropy , shape - dependent dipolar interactions , and exchange interactions which govern ferromagnetic spin - wave spectral characteristics .",
    "@xmath1 is the ratio of the total magnetic moment and the angular momentum of the electrons in the ferromagnet ; in 3@xmath3 transition - metal ferromagnets , such as fe and co , it is close to the free - electron value @xmath4 .",
    "the gilbert - damping constant @xmath2 parametrizes the viscous damping of an excited magnetization to the ( locally ) lowest - energy configuration .",
    "its value differs considerably for various materials and also depends on the temperature and on the impurity / defect composition of a given sample .",
    "the motion of the magnetization - direction unit vector @xmath5 is determined by the phenomenological landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation : gilbert : pr55 @xmath6    the magnetization dynamics of small monodomain ferromagnets are well described by the llg equation ( [ llg ] ) down to the micron scale .",
    "new effects may play a role on the submicron scale , however .",
    "the magnetization dynamics is no longer a highly coherent process because interface and surface roughness are relatively more important in small samples .",
    "many - magnon processes can then acquire a sizeable spectral weight arias : prb99 and are observable as , e.g. an increased line width of the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr).@xcite another source of additional fmr broadening is non - local , depending on the environment into which the ferromagnet is embedded : a time - dependent ferromagnetic order parameter pumps spin currents that carry angular momentum ( and energy ) into adjacent conducting materials .",
    "@xcite this angular - momentum loss , in turn , is equivalent to an additional damping torque on the magnetization.@xcite    the spin - pumping concept for the magnetization dynamics of nanostructures has far - reaching consequences .",
    "it gives rise to an enhanced gilbert damping of magnetic films in contact with conducting media,@xcite may be employed as an fmr - operated spin battery,@xcite explains a dynamic exchange coupling in magnetic bilayers , heinrich : prl03,tserkovnyak : jap03 as well as a dynamic stiffness against current - induced magnetization reversal.@xcite the analysis of experimental fmr probes of the magnetization dynamics in single filmstserkovnyak : prb022 and magnetic bilayers@xcite relied on phenomenological models of the electronic structure .",
    "here we show how these assumptions can be relaxed by using instead scattering matrices calculated from first principles which take into account the detailed atomic and electronic structure of the materials under study .",
    "an early phenomenological treatment of the non - locality of the magnetization dynamics in hybrid normal - metal / ferromagnet ( _ n / f _ ) structures was given by silsbee _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite recently , imnek _ _ et al.__@xcite pointed out that time - dependent linear - response theory could be used to calculate the spin flows generated by a ferromagnet with a time - varying magnetization in contact with a non - magnetic conductor , as an alternative to the scattering - theory approach of tserkovnyak _ _ et al.__@xcite in spite of the different starting point , complete agreement between the two methods was demonstrated @xcite for the simple case of a @xmath7-function magnetic layer embedded in a free - electron gas .",
    "in addition , it was argued in refs .   that the electron - electron interactions can considerably enhance the spin currents into normal metals with large stoner - enhancement factors .",
    "the linear - response framework has also been used to calculate the enhanced gilbert damping of finite - thickness ferromagnetic films.@xcite it was argued there that ultra - thin films display oscillatory damping ( as a function of thickness ) due to quantum - size effects . in the following ,",
    "we show that these quantum - interference effects are greatly overestimated by the ballistic free - electron band model and do not survive when realistic transition - metal band structures are used . by calculating from first principles the scattering matrix entering the spin - pumping theory,@xcite",
    "we show that quantum - size oscillations are much smaller than those reported in ref .  , especially if even small amounts of disorder are introduced .",
    "we also find that the additional term in the ferromagnetic equation of motion is of the gilbert - damping form , with only a very small correction to the gyromagnetic ratio ( the same conclusion can also be drawn from previous work@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the electron - electron interaction effects discussed by imnek@xcite are taken into account in the exchange - correlation potential which we calculate self - consistently within the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) of density - functional theory .",
    "finally , our results confirm that the spin - current - induced magnetization torque@xcite is an interface effect , which was earlier taken for granted @xcite and analyzed in detail in ref .  .",

    "the quantities determining the damping enhancement are not densities of states but transmission and reflection mixing conductances determined from the scattering matrix .",
    "these , we have seen , can be approximated very well by @xmath108 which is very close to the sharvin conductance of the normal metal .",
    "values of this quantity are given for cu , ta , pd and pt in the last row of the table .",
    "it is seen that the sharvin conductance changes less than @xmath111 . more significantly , with a maximum for ta",
    ", the trend does not correspond to that observed experimentally : @xcite cu @xmath114 ta @xmath114 pd @xmath114 pt .",
    "we believe that the explanation should be sought elsewhere , possibly in the increasing spin - orbit interaction which will lead to the heavier materials behaving as more efficient spin sinks . to examine this suggestion in detail",
    "requires the reformulation of the spin - pumping theory to include spin - orbit interaction .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the transmission and reflection mixing conductances that govern the non - local effects in the ferromagnetic magnetization dynamics for two commonly used _ n_/_f _ combinations : au / fe and cu / co . in both cases ,",
    "the transmission mixing conductance @xmath12 is much smaller than the reflection mixing conductance @xmath11 , except for the thinnest magnetic films , only a few atoms thick . even for such thin films , @xmath19 is smaller than @xmath115 . furthermore , @xmath12 is more sensitive to disorder , even a small amount of which reduces it to zero while having only a small effect on @xmath11 as shown in figs .",

    ". the general formulas ( [ geff ] ) and ( [ aeff ] ) predict that the spin pumping renormalizes both the gilbert damping ( @xmath2 ) and the gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath1 ) of a ferromagnetic film embedded in a conducting non - magnetic medium .",
    "however , in view of the results discussed in the previous section , we conclude that , for all but the thinnest and cleanest magnetic layers , the only effect of the spin pumping is to enhance the gilbert damping .",
    "the correction is directly proportional to the real part of the reflection mixing conductance and is essentially an interface property .",
    "we also find that oscillatory effects are averaged out for realistic band structures , especially in the presence of disorder .",
    "@xmath118 ( which determines the damping enhancement of a single ferromagnetic film embedded in a perfect spin - sink medium ) is usually very close to @xmath119 for intermetallic interfacesxia : prb02,stiles : prb02 ( being in general bounded by @xmath120 according to its definition , eq .  [ eq : mix_cond ] ) .",
    "these results also apply to the spin - current induced magnetization reversal in intermetallic systems , indicating that the effective field  correction due to the imaginary part of the mixing conductance and bulk contributions to the torque are very small .     calculated for a free electron model with @xmath121 ( energy measured from the bottom of the parabolic conduction band in the normal metal ) and various choices of the exchange splitting @xmath122 .",
