    "in recent work , we have reported near - exact @xcite and exact @xcite solutions of the singlet ground state of two electrons , interacting _ via _ a coulomb potential , but trapped on the surface of a sphere .",
    "this model was first used by berry and co - workers in the 1980 s to provide insight into angular correlation in two - electron systems @xcite .",
    "it has proven useful for understanding the electronic polarity of nanoclusters and for explaining the giant polarizability of na@xmath0f@xmath1 and spontaneous dipole formation on niobium clusters @xcite . within the adiabatic connection in density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite ,",
    "seidl carefully studied this system @xcite in order to test the isi ( interaction - strength interpolation ) model @xcite , deriving values of the energy by numerical integration .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that this kind of spherical constraint applied to the moshinsky atom @xcite leads to a solvable schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "berry and collaborators also considered an extension in which each particle is confined to a different , concentric sphere @xcite and used this model to simulate the rovibrational spectra of the water molecule in both the ground @xcite and excited states @xcite .",
    "more recently , the model has been applied to quantum - mechanical calculations of large - amplitude light - atom dynamics in polyatomic hydrides @xcite .",
    "it seems timely therefore to generalize our earlier studies @xcite to the case of two electrons located on the surface of two concentric spheres of different radii . to be consistent with our previous work @xcite , we will focus on the singlet ground state , which allows us to confine our attention to the symmetric spatial part of the wave function and ignore the spin coordinates . however , when the two radii are not equal , the spin coordinates are irrelevant , and one can easily generalize the present results to the triplet state by antisymmetrizing the spatial wave function .",
    "symmetric and asymmetric hartree - fock ( hf ) solutions are discussed in section [ sec : hf ] and the strengths and weaknesses of mller - plesset ( mp ) perturbation theory @xcite in section [ sec : mp ] .",
    "we consider asymptotic solutions for the large - spheres regime in section [ sec : larger ] and , in section [ sec : ci ] , we study the convergence behavior of the variational configuration interaction ( ci ) scheme . finally , by investigating the shape of the position intracule and the corresponding coulomb hole ( section [ sec : p ] ) , we report the existence of a secondary coulomb hole , shedding light on long - range correlation effects in two - electron systems .",
    "atomic units are used throughout .",
    "our model consists of two concentric spheres of radii @xmath2 , each bearing one electron .",
    "the position of the @xmath3-th electron is defined by the spherical angles @xmath4 , the interelectronic angle @xmath5 by @xmath6 and the interelectronic distance by @xmath7 where @xmath8    the hamiltonian of the system @xmath9 is simply @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath12 is the coulomb operator .",

    "such systems are known as wigner molecules @xcite and have been observed in a variety of similar systems @xcite .",
