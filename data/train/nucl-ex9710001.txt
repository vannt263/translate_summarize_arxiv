    "the possibility to study the radiochemical composition of the earth by detecting , at the surface , the antineutrinos ( @xmath0 ) emitted by the decay of radioactive isotopes within has been suggested before @xcite . confirming the abundance of certain radioactive elements in the crust and mantle could establish important geophysical constraints on the heat generation within the earth .",
    "radioactivity is thought to be the dominant heat source driving mantle convection @xcite .",
    "it is also an important factor in determining the surface heat flow in continents and in understanding the thermal history of the earth .",
    "uranium and thorium , in particular , play an important role due to their relatively large abundances and long half - lives . improved constraints on the present uranium and thorium abundances in the mantle and crust could yield better estimates for these internal , geodynamic heat sources .",
    "detecting the low - energy antineutrinos from radioactivity is a challenge due to their small interaction cross - section . at present , the only practical medium for detecting terrestrial antineutrinos would be a large - mass liquid scintillator , observing the inverse @xmath1-decay reaction on the proton .",
    "new scintillator detectors are being built in italy and japan that could inaugurate the field of antineutrino geophysics .",
    "various candidates for the target nucleus to be used in an antineutrino detector have also been discussed ; however , if practical considerations for procuring the huge quantities ( tons ) of target material are evaluated , only hydrogen , in the form of water or organic liquid scintillator ( ch@xmath2 ) , emerges as a feasible target . the reaction : @xmath3 has a relatively large cross - section .",
    "its main advantage is the production of a neutron which captures with a mean lifetime of about 200 @xmath4s , via @xmath5 , releasing 2.2  mev energy and forming a delayed coincidence with the positron .",
    "this provides a distinctive event signature for an antineutrino interaction .",
    "the threshold for this reaction is 1.8  mev ; the maximum energy of the antineutrinos produced by natural radioactivity is 3.27  mev .",
    "consequently , the positron from ( 1 ) deposits at most 2.5  mev ( including both 0.511 mev annihilation @xmath6 rays ) . at these low energies",
    ", liquid scintillator detectors would be favored over water erenkov detectors , due to their higher light yield .    of the naturally - occurring radioactive elements in the earth ,",
    "only four @xmath1 decays in the @xmath7u and @xmath8th chains produce a significant number of antineutrinos with energy greater than 1.8  mev .",
    "the decay of @xmath9bi ( u chain ) has an 18% branch @xcite to the ground state , with a @xmath1 endpoint of 3.27  mev .",
    "the @xmath1 decays from @xmath10pa ( u chain ) , @xmath11ac and @xmath12bi ( th chain ) have practically the same maximum decay energy , 2.29 mev , 2.08 mev , and 2.25 mev , respectively .",
    "consequently , the terrestrial @xmath0 spectrum above 1.8  mev takes on a `` two - component '' form , with its higher - energy component coming solely from @xmath7u decay and a lower component with contributions from @xmath7u and @xmath8th .",
    "this distinctive spectral shape would also assist in identifying these events in a scintillation detector .",
    "it is usually assumed that the earth s core contains no u and th after core / mantle partitioning @xcite .",
    "consequently , the starting point for determining the distribution of uranium and thorium in the present crust and mantle is understanding the composition of the `` bulk silicate earth '' ( bse ) , which is the model representing the primordial mantle prior to crust formation ( equivalent in composition to the modern mantle plus crust ) .",
    "bse compositional estimates have been compiled @xcite and derived using several techniques .",
    "more recently , bse concentrations of 0.0795 ppm ( @xmath13 ) for @xmath8th and 0.0203  ppm ( @xmath14 ) for u , have been suggested @xcite , with subjective error estimates that encompass most of the values listed in @xcite .",
    "this amount of thorium in the mantle and crust would produce 9  tw of heat , and uranium 8  tw , which can be compared to the total global heat outflow of @xmath1540  tw @xcite .    in the formation of the earth s crust ,",
    "the primitive mantle was depleted of uranium and thorium @xcite , while the continental crust , in particular , was highly enriched @xcite .",
    "rock samples from the upper continental crust provide direct isotopic abundance information .",
    "data from continental heat flow measurements @xcite are also important in deducing the bulk radiochemical composition .",
    "a recent perspective on the nature of the continental crust @xcite includes data from chemical studies of lower crustal rocks and makes lithological assignments from seismological data to improve estimates of the composition of the middle and lower crust . combining these sources , the current best estimates for the average uranium and thorium concentrations in the continental crust",
    "are listed in .",
    "samples of mid - ocean ridge basalts ( morb ) provide the main input for estimating the bulk uranium and thorium content of oceanic crust .",
    "concentrations slightly higher than those found in typical morb s are representative of the bulk oceanic crust composition ; values are listed in table  1 .    with the above data , the average u and th concentrations for the `` residual '' , present - day mantle can be calculated .",
    "we assumed an average thickness of 40 km for the continental crust and 6 km for the oceanic crust and subtracted these enriched layers from the bse concentrations .",
    "an interesting problem is distributing the isotopic depletion of the mantle .",
    "the discontinuity at 670 km depth may act as a barrier to mass flow @xcite , resulting in u and th depletion of only the upper mantle .",
    "others do not consider this to be the case @xcite .",
    "taking the assumption of whole - mantle convection , we selected a uniform composition for the entire mantle and list average u and th concentrations in table  1 .",
    "the difference in u and th activity between continental and oceanic crust is substantial . therefore , the crustal topography near an antineutrino detector is important to take into account when calculating the @xmath0 flux ; previous calculations did not include such a detailed analysis .",
    "we employed crust type and thickness data in the form of a global crustal map : ( w.  d.  mooney , g.  laske , and t.  g.  masters , crust  5.1 : a global crustal model at @xmath16 , submitted to the _ journal of geophysical research , _ 1997 ; data accesible from the world wide web server for the u.s .",
    "geological survey at http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/study/crustalstructure/ ) .",
    "the data include 16 primary crust types with about 140 different sub - types . in our calculations",
    ", we lumped the crust classification into just continental and oceanic and used the average u and th concentrations ( from table  1 ) regardless of sub - classification , but did use the crust thickness data , which range from 670 km .",
    "we calculated the @xmath0 flux from u and th decay for several sites around the world . in the @xmath7u decay chain , there are 6 @xmath1 decays ( @xmath0 emitting ) for each @xmath7u decay ; the @xmath8th decay chain goes through 4 @xmath1 decays per @xmath8th decay . in , these factors were included in the tabulated fluxes . from this total flux only an average of 0.38 antineutrinos per @xmath7u decay ( from all branches in the entire decay chain )",
    "have energy above the reaction threshold of 1.804 mev . for the thorium chain",
    ", an average of 0.15 antineutrinos per @xmath8th decay can make the inverse @xmath1-decay reaction .",
    "entries for the geographic `` maximum '' and `` minimum '' are also included in table  2 .",
    "in these two bounding , hypothetical cases , the maximum refers to the situation where all of the continental crust ( of average thickness 40  km , covering 40% of the earth s surface area ) forms a circular cap centered around the @xmath0 detector .",
    "the minimum refers to the contrasting scenario , with a @xmath0 detector in the middle of a grand ocean ( 6  km oceanic crust covering 60% of the earth ) .",
    "it is interesting that the terrestrial @xmath0 flux for a site in the himalayas is close to the geographic maximum flux ; this is due to a crust thickness of @xmath1570 km in this region , which exceeds the average value .    to lowest - order , neglecting the neutron recoil ,",
    "the cross - section for @xmath0 capture on protons is @xcite : @xmath17^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the neutron ",
    "proton mass difference , and the @xmath19 values come from neutron @xmath1 decay @xcite .",
    "we integrated this cross - section with the antineutrino spectra from each energetic u and th @xmath1 decay , including fermi function corrections @xcite , to estimate event rates in two new liquid scintillator detectors being built .",
    "the borexino experiment at gran sasso will contain 280 tons of pseudocumene - based scintillator ( c@xmath20h@xmath21 ) ; in this detector , the terrestrial antineutrino event rate would be 10 events per year .",
    "for the kam - land experiment in the kamioka mine , 1,000 tons of mineral - oil - based scintillator ( ch@xmath2 ) would detect 29 @xmath0 events from u and th decay per year .",
    "the terrestrial @xmath0 event rates are very low ; however , these events have a correlated signature , the positron ",
    "neutron delayed coincidence .",
    "the most problematic background in reactor antineutrino experiments are fast neutrons ( especially those produced by muon interactions ) . to minimize this background requires : an underground location for cosmic - ray flux reduction ; low - radioactivity in the detector ; sufficient external neutron shielding ; and a tight muon veto surrounding the detector",
    ". these conditions might be satisfied in the two new experiments .",
    "a background that can not be shielded is the @xmath0 flux from the world s nuclear reactors @xcite . in table  2",
    ", we also list our calculated reactor @xmath0 fluxes .",
    "this calculation employed data from the international nuclear safety center database and assumed all reactors operating at full power ( data for all of the world s nuclear reactors are available from the world wide web server for the international nuclear safety center at http://www.insc.anl.gov ) .",
    "the scaling of the @xmath0 flux was based upon a reactor antineutrino yield of @xmath22 @xmath0 per second for 2,800 mw thermal power @xcite and a typical efficiency of 33% for electric / thermal power .",
    "the unique two - component shape of the terrestrial antineutrino energy spectrum makes it possible to identify these events above the reactor @xmath0 background . in",
    ", the energy spectrum for the positrons produced by @xmath0 capture on protons is displayed , revealing spectral features at 1.5 and 2.5 mev .",
    "the positron spectrum from reactor antineutrinos has a well - known shape @xcite .",
    "measuring this spectrum enables the reactor backgrounds to be subtracted and allows the higher - energy terrestrial @xmath0 component from uranium to be separated from the thorium contribution .",
    "site selection would be important for future terrestrial @xmath0 experiments .",
    "a site in australia , far from any nuclear reactors , has a flux @xmath15200@xmath23 lower than the reactor @xmath0 flux at kamioka .",
    "an oceanic location ( possibly near hawaii ) enables a @xmath0 flux measurement to be predominantly sensitive to radioactivity from the mantle .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the terrestrial antineutrino data from several experiments around the world .",
    "in doing so , one might be able to separate the contributions from the crust and mantle .",
    "though event rates will be low and background suppression a challenge , two new experiments will be evaluating these backgrounds and exploring the prospects for antineutrino geophysics in the near future .",
