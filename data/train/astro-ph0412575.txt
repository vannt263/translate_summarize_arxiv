    "are black holes easily ejected from dwarf galaxies by gravitational recoil following black hole mergers @xcite ?",
    "extending the local black hole mass function to masses below @xmath0 @xmath1  would also aid in prediction of event rates for black hole mergers detectable by _ lisa _",

    "if black holes do exist in the centers of dwarf galaxies and very late - type spirals , then the subset that are undergoing accretion can potentially be detected as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "however , very few agns have been identified with black hole masses below @xmath0 @xmath1  or in host galaxies with @xmath6 km s@xmath4 .",
    "these include ngc 4395 @xcite , pox 52 @xcite , possibly ngc 4051 @xcite , and a few other narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the first systematic survey for agns with low - mass black holes was recently carried out by @xcite ( hereinafter gh ) , who examined the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release one ( dr1 ) archives to find 19 seyfert 1 galaxies having estimated black hole masses below @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersions for the gh sample can not be determined from the sdss spectra , because the instrumental dispersion of @xmath7 km s@xmath4  sets a practical lower limit to the range of velocity dispersions that can be measured , and in most cases the spectra are dominated by agn emission . here , we present new measurements of the stellar velocity dispersions for 13 galaxies from this sample and two additional seyferts we identified from sdss dr2 meeting the same selection criteria : sdss j080907.58 + 441641.4 and sdss j215658.30 + 110343.1 .",

    "we measured the stellar kinematics by fitting broadened stellar spectra to the galaxy spectra , following techniques described by @xcite .",
    "a gaussian velocity broadening function was assumed , and the fits included both an additive featureless continuum component and a multiplicative low - order polynomial that can compensate for reddening in the galaxy spectrum .",
    "fits were performed in two spectral regions : @xmath45  , which includes mg@xmath46 , fe5270 , and numerous weaker features ; and @xmath47  , covering the near - infrared triplet .",
    "the exact fitting region was tailored for each galaxy to fit within a single echelle order and to exclude emission lines such as [ ] @xmath48 and [ ] @xmath49 .",
    "the measurement uncertainty was taken to be the sum in quadrature of the fitting uncertainty from the best - fitting template and the standard deviation of results from all templates .",
    "a minimum of six template stars were used for each measurement .",
    "we note that the problem of template mismatch in the mg / fe abundance ratio , which is often noticeable in high - dispersion galaxies @xcite , does not significantly affect this sample .",
    "we were able to determine velocity dispersions for 13 of the 15 objects we observed from the gh sample , as well as the two new sdss objects , using the mg@xmath46  spectral region .",
    "the other two galaxies were dominated by agn emission and no useful results could be recovered from the template fitting . for 7 galaxies we were able to measure @xmath50 from the triplet region as well ; the results are generally consistent with the mg@xmath46  results but have larger uncertainties because of the smaller spectral region used for the fitting .",

    "black hole masses were derived by gh from the sdss spectra using the empirical relations from @xcite .",
    "these relations combine the broad - line region ( blr ) radius ( derived from the nonstellar 5100 continuum luminosity ) and broad - line width to obtain a virial estimate of the central mass .",
    "single - epoch virial estimates of @xmath52  based on this technique are thought to have a random scatter of roughly a factor of 3 , based on the consistency of the masses with the @xmath2relation and other tests ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while fwhm(h@xmath53 ) is most commonly used as a measure of the velocity distribution of the blr , the h@xmath53  emission lines in the sdss spectra have low s / n and gh used fwhm(h@xmath54 ) as a surrogate .",
    "the high s / n and spectral resolution of the esi data make it possible to perform decompositions of the h@xmath54 + [ ] lines that are more accurate than the previous measurements from sdss spectra . following the methods used by gh",
    ", we fit h@xmath54 + [ ] using a multi - gaussian model .",
    "all three narrow components ( h@xmath54  and [ ] @xmath55 ) were constrained to have the same velocity width , and the wavelength separation and intensity ratio of the [ ] lines were fixed at their laboratory values .",
    "two gaussians were required to fit the broad component of h@xmath54  adequately for most galaxies . in most cases our results for fwhm(h@xmath54 ) are similar to those of gh , but in a few cases such as gh11 the esi spectrum yields a substantially larger width , which we attribute to the difficulty of deblending the line profiles in sdss spectra having weak broad components and only marginally resolved narrow lines .",
    "the difference in linewidths could also be due in part to intrinsic variability .",
    "the statistical uncertainties on fwhm(h@xmath54 ) from the profile fits are small , typically only @xmath56 km s@xmath4 , while the true uncertainties on the linewidths are dominated by systematics including starlight subtraction errors , and we estimate these uncertainties to be of order 10% in fwhm(h@xmath54 ) .",
    "we also measured the h@xmath53linewidths using a double - gaussian model to represent the broad component . for three objects the broad h@xmath53  line did not have sufficient s / n to obtain a meaningful fit , and in one object ( gh11 ) broad h@xmath53",
    "was not detected at all .",
    "we do not find any systematic trend for h@xmath53  to be significantly broader than h@xmath54 , and we use the h@xmath54  lines to determine @xmath52  because their higher s / n enabled us to measure the linewidths in a consistent manner for the entire sample .",
    "since the keck spectra were observed and extracted through a small aperture and the slit losses are unknown , we continue to use the gh measurements of the agn continuum luminosity obtained from the sdss spectra .",
    "these may slightly overestimate the true agn luminosity because of residual starlight in the sdss spectra .",
    "@xmath57-band imaging of this sample would be the best way to obtain more accurate luminosities .",
    "single - epoch virial mass estimates for black holes in agns are subject to potentially significant systematics , due to uncertainties in both the slope @xmath58 of the blr radius - luminosity relation ( @xmath59 ) and the normalization factor @xmath60 in the virial relation @xmath61 .",
    "the radius - luminosity relation is not well determined for @xmath62 erg s@xmath4 , and this presents particular problems for our sample since it is necessary to extrapolate this relation to luminosities as low as @xmath63 erg s@xmath4 . following @xcite and @xcite we use @xmath64 ; setting @xmath65 instead ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would raise the masses by 0.3 dex on average . to obtain virial masses",
    ", we use the recent calibration of @xmath60 from @xcite and @xcite , which was derived by scaling the black hole masses of reverberation - mapped seyferts to fit the @xmath2  relation .",
    "this calibration increases the black hole masses by 0.27 dex relative to masses derived for the assumption of isotropic orbits of blr clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and shifts the sample to systematically higher masses than those originally given by gh .",
    "the revised masses are listed in table 1 .",
    "figure [ msigma ] displays the @xmath2  relation for agns with low black hole masses as well as for nearby galaxies with direct dynamical measurements of @xmath52 . for the sdss sample , ngc 4395 , and pox 52 , the vertical error bars",
    "represent a factor of 3 uncertainty in @xmath52 , corresponding to the expected level of random scatter for single - epoch measurements .",
    "overall , the sdss agns lie close to the @xmath2relation extrapolated to low masses .",
    "compared to the @xcite @xmath2  relation with power - law slope 4.02 , the sdss galaxies have a mean offset of 0.23 dex in @xmath52  and an rms scatter of 0.56 dex .",
    "the mean offset and rms scatter are 0.64 dex and 0.85 dex , respectively , relative to the steeper @xmath2  relation of @xcite with slope 4.72 .",
    "( the mean offset from the tremaine et al .",

    "the scatter of 0.56 dex relative to the shallower @xmath2  relation is only slightly larger than the scatter of 0.40.5 dex for agns with reverberation - based black hole masses @xcite .",
    "this overall consistency suggests that both the blr radius - luminosity relation and the @xmath2  relation can reasonably be extrapolated to black holes in the range @xmath67 @xmath1 , well below the mass scales in which these correlations have been calibrated .",
    "given the systematic uncertainties involved in deriving single - epoch virial masses for these objects and the substantial scatter , we do not attempt to fit the slope of the @xmath2  relation based on the new data . nevertheless , our results may be useful as a constraint on models making specific predictions for the low - mass end of the @xmath2  relation .",
    "for example , the hierarchical black hole growth scenario of @xcite predicts that the @xmath2  slope should substantially steepen below @xmath68 km s@xmath4  as supernova feedback becomes more efficient at slowing the agn fueling rate .",
    "the low - mass agn sample does not show such behavior .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the gh sample is only the upper envelope of the population of black holes in low - mass galaxies .",
    "the selection technique used by gh is only possible for broad - lined agns , and the probability of detecting a galaxy as an agn in the sdss archive depends on the agn luminosity , which in turn depends on @xmath52 .",
    "this potentially biases the sample towards preferential detection of agns with the highest - mass black holes for a given @xmath50 .",
    "there are still few direct constraints on the masses of black holes in inactive dwarf ellipticals or late - type spirals , and the case of m33 demonstrates that some late - type galaxies may not contain a black hole at all @xcite .",
    "dynamical searches for low - mass black holes should be continued whenever feasible in order to obtain an unbiased sample of detections or upper limits in this mass range .    based on their broad - line widths of @xmath69 km s@xmath4",
    ", the gh objects can be classified as narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) .",
    "our observations provide new data to test recent claims regarding the @xmath2  relation of nls1s . using [ ] emission - line velocity dispersions as a surrogate for stellar velocity dispersions",
    ", @xcite found that _ rosat_-selected nls1s lie below the @xmath2  relation , typically by an order of magnitude , and concluded that nls1s are `` young '' agns with undermassive black holes .",
    "we find , on the contrary , that the low - mass nls1 galaxies in the gh sample do not deviate significantly from the local @xmath2  relation . the use of [ ] emission - line velocity dispersions by @xcite in place of stellar velocity dispersions may be the cause of this discrepancy . as recently shown by @xcite ,",
    "nls1s apparently deviate from the @xcite empirical trend for seyferts to have similar stellar and emission - line velocity dispersions .",
    "we will examine the relation between the stellar and emission - line velocity dispersions for the gh sample in a future paper , in the context of a larger sample of seyfert galaxies covering a wide range of black hole masses .",
    "we have measured the stellar velocity dispersions of 15 seyfert 1 galaxies selected from the sdss to have low - mass black holes based on their broad - line widths and nonstellar continuum luminosities .",
    "the velocity dispersions for this sample are small , ranging from 36 to 81 km s@xmath4 , and the results are consistent with a simple extrapolation of the @xmath2  relation to low masses .",
    "this initial view of the demographics of low - mass black holes in agns implies a remarkable continuity in the growth and evolution of black holes and their host galaxies for @xmath52  ranging from @xmath70 to over @xmath71 @xmath1 .",
    "further refinement of the black hole mass estimates is possible if reverberation mapping can be successfully carried out for agns having @xmath72 @xmath1 ; this may be the best prospect for a definitive measurement of the @xmath2  slope for low - mass black holes .",
