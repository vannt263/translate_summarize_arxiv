    "interactions of gas - rich disk galaxies show intense bursts of star formation .",
    "for example hst - images of the antennae ( whitmore et al.1999 ) reveal that the knots of intense star formation produce clusters of massive young star clusters .",
    "these aggregates which we call super - clusters ( @xmath1 cluster of star clusters ; not to confuse with super stellar cluster ( ssc ) , which are individual massive star clusters ) appear to contain dozens to hundreds of massive star clusters within a region spanning only a few hundred pc to a kpc in radius .    on the other hand new observations of the central galaxy of the fornax cluster revealed a new class of unresolved , compact objects ( hilker et al .  1999 ,",
    "phillipps et al .  2001 ) with radii of a few hundred pc , which are called ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( ucd ) . also in a few lenticular field galaxies ( e.g.  ngc  1023 ) larson and brodie ( 2000 , 2002 ) found star clusters with extremely large effective radii ( @xmath2  pc ) which they call faint fuzzies .",
    "here we show n - body results concerning the dynamical evolution of such super - cluster aggregates .",
    "all simulations of super - clusters show a strong merging behaviour building up compact merger objects in few super - cluster crossing times ( fellhauer et al .",
    "depending on the initial conditions of our simulations ( strong or weak tidal field ; massive or extended low - mass super - cluster ) our resulting merger objects have similar properties like the new classes of objects above ( fellhauer & kroupa 2002a / b ) .    but",
    "placing compact and massive super - clusters in strong tidal fields on an orbit similar to @xmath0-cen reveals an object which has similar properties like the most massive globular cluster ( gc ) in the milky way .",
    "@xmath0-cen is not only the most massive gc , it has also some strange properties like different populations of stars ( different ages and metalicities ) .",
    "it shows signs of rotation with a maximum rotation speed of @xmath3  km / s ( freeman 2001 ) .",
    "we use the particle - mesh code superbox ( fellhauer et al .",
    "2000 ) which incorporates a hierarchical grid architecture allowing high resolution at the places of interest .",
    "we model the single star clusters as plummer spheres ( plummer 1911 , numerical realisation : aarseth et al .  1974 ) with a plummer radius of @xmath4  pc , which corresponds to the mean half - light radius found for the individual young star clusters in the antennae ( whitmore et al.1999 ) . @xmath5",
    "star clusters with a mass range of @xmath6  m@xmath7 following a power - law mass spectrum , @xmath8 , are placed in a plummer distribution with plummer radius @xmath9 of @xmath10  pc , a cut - off radius of @xmath11  pc and a total mass of @xmath12  m@xmath7 representing the super - cluster .",
    "the crossing time of the super - cluster is @xmath13  myr and the velocity dispersion of the clusters in the super - cluster is @xmath14  kms@xmath15 .",
    "additionally we choose the sense of rotation of all clusters in the super - cluster to be the same to investigate the resulting rotation - law of the merger object .",
    "a super - cluster is expected to rotate if it forms from a contracting and locally differentially rotating inner tidal arm .",
    "the super - cluster is placed on an eccentric orbit with perigalacticon at @xmath16  kpc and apogalacticon at @xmath17  kpc .",
    "the orbit is inclined such that the maximum @xmath18-distance from the disc plane is about @xmath19  kpc .",
    "the parameters are chosen to be representative of the knots seen to contain many star clusters in the antennae galaxies , while the orbital inclination is motivated by the orbit of @xmath0-cen ( dinescu et al .",
    "the host galaxy is represented by an analytical potential , which consists of a disc modelled as a plummer - kuzmin potential and a spherical halo component modelled as a logarithmic potential : @xmath20 with @xmath21  m@xmath7 , @xmath22  kpc , @xmath23  kpc , @xmath24  km / s and @xmath25  kpc which sums up to an almost flat rotation curve with a rotation speed of @xmath26  kms@xmath15 .",
    "it is possible to follow the evolution with a particle - mesh code that neglects dynamical effects of two - body relaxation , because the half - mass ( bulk ) two - body relaxation time of the single star clusters , which can be estimated from ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) @xmath27 is @xmath28  myr for a @xmath29  m@xmath7 star cluster ranging up to @xmath30  gyr for a @xmath31  m@xmath7 star cluster , while the merging timescale is much shorter ( fellhauer et al .",
    "2002 ) . furthermore ,",
    "as shown below , the resulting merger objects have relaxation times of a hubble - time or longer .",
    "after the merging process is over ( @xmath32  myr ) the object loses mass due to tidal shaping on its eccentric orbit . because of the collision - free code no mass - loss due to internal evolution ( evaporation because of two - body encounters @xmath1 two - body relaxation )",
    "is taken into account . but taking eq .",
    "[ eq : relax ] the merger object has a relaxation time of about 60  gyr , therefore mass - loss due to evaporation should be a minor effect .",
    "the bound mass of the merger object is about @xmath33  m@xmath7 after formation and after @xmath34  gyr of tidal shaping it still has @xmath35  m@xmath7 .",
    "the mass after formation is smaller than the sum of the merged star clusters because of massloss during the violent merging process .",
    "most of this unbound material gets spread along the orbit of the merger object but some of these stars can still be found in the neighbourhood or even within the merger object .",
    "one can see this clearly in the line - of - sight velocity dispersion .",
    "this causes a rise in velocity dispersion shortly within and beyond the tidal radius , which is due to these unbound stars which have a totally different velocity signature than the bound stars .",
    "after @xmath34  gyr the half - mass radius of the object is @xmath36  pc and the total size ( tidal radius ) is about @xmath11  pc ( 93 at perigalacticon and 120 at apogalacticon ) .",
    "fitting a king - profile to the surface density distribution gives a core radius ( @xmath1 effective or half - light radius ) of @xmath37  pc and a central surface density of @xmath38  m@xmath39pc@xmath40 which corresponds to a central surface brightness ( taking @xmath41 ) of about @xmath42  mag./arcsec@xmath40 .",
    "a better fit to the data would be an exponential profile in the inner part with a power law profile with power index @xmath43 for the outer part .",
    "the 3d velocity dispersion of the merger object is about 24  km / s , while the line - of - sight velocity dispersion is about 14  km / s .",
    "the maximum rotation velocity of our object is 4  km / s .",
    ".properties of @xmath0-cen . [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "although our best model does not yet have exactly the same properties as @xmath0-cen , we think that we are on the right way to solve the puzzle of the origin of @xmath0-cen .",
    "our merger object is still not heavy enough and too large compared to @xmath0-cen .",
    "a possible explanation of the age and metalicity spread and the high rotation speed could be an underlying population of old stars stemming from a dissolved dwarf galaxy plunging into the milky way and causing the star burst and the formation of the super - cluster , which leads to the building of @xmath0-cen in the above described scenario .",
    "this scenario is being studied with numerical experiments that have started recently .",
