    "x - ray pulsar hercules x-1 discovered in 1971 by the uhuru satellite is one of the best studied x - ray source .",
    "her x-1 is the first source in which x - ray spectrum the line feature in the 39 - 58 kev energy range was observed , which could not be identified with any chemical element , and was suggested to be a cyclotron line @xcite .",
    "this feature was observed later in @xcite . when this feature is interpreted as a cyclotron line",
    ", the magnetic field strength may be calculated from the non - relativistic formula    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the cycle frequency of the electrons , identified with the frequency of the observed x - ray feature , @xmath2 is the mass of the electron , @xmath3 is the light speed . in this case",
    "the magnetic field strength should be of the order of @xmath4 gs .",
    "but as large as this value comes into conflict with some theoretical reasonings among which the most important are consideration of the interrelation between radio and x - ray pulsars @xcite , and simulation of the pulse variability during the 35-days cycle in observations from the satellites astron @xcite , ginga and rxte @xcite .",
    "obscuration of x - ray beams during the 35 day cycle is often used to explain the periodic x - ray high - low state transitions of her x-1 during the accretion disk precession .",
    "if the obscuring material is the inner edge of the accretion disk , then the inner disk must be tilted out of the binary plane and be precessing to produce periodically varying obscuration .",
    "in such a situation , occultation of the neutron star would occur twice in each precession cycle , leading to the decline in flux , and termination of the main and short high states .",
    "this scheme was also extended @xcite to explain pulse profile evolution with a reflection of the light on the off state by the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "the value of the dipole magnetic field of the neutron star , determining the radius of the inner edge , coinciding with the radius of the alfven surface , was estimated in this model as @xmath5  gs .    let us stress , that in this model the region where the non - collision shock wave is formed is situated at the upper side of the accretion column , so it is separated in space from the region where the main x - ray flux is formed .",
    "therefore , in connection with this model , there is no need to make any principal changing in the standard model .",
    "only the structure of the accretion column could be modified adjusting to the lower value of the magnetic field .",
    "the most reliable estimation of the magnetic field @xmath6 in neutron stars ( dipole component ) is obtained for radiopulsars by measurements of a growth of their rotation period at magneto - dipole losses . for single radiopulsars , forming a large group of about 2000 objects ,",
    "this field is varies @xcite around @xmath7 g. in addition to the main body of the objects on the diagram @xmath8 there is a smaller group of radiopulsars @xcite with more rapid rotation and lower magnetic fields @xmath9 .",
    "about 200 of these pulsars are called `` recycled pulsars '' , which passed the stage of accretion in close binaries , when they gain a rapid rotational speed , and decrease their magnetic field @xcite .",
    "majority of recycled pulsars had low mass companions , remaining as a white dwarf in the binary system , and lower magnetic fields @xmath10 gs , and few tens of pulsars are in the binary with another neutron star , and magnetic field up to @xmath11 gs . the optical companion of the her x1 is a star with mass @xmath12 , which ends its evolution as a white dwarf .",
    "therefore , there is not surprising for the neutron star in this system to have a magnetic field in the range @xmath5  gs .    to solve the problem of discrepancy between this estimation and the value following from the cyclotron interpretation ( [ bfield ] ) , it was suggested in @xcite , that the observed feature could be explained by the relativistic dipole radiation of electrons having strongly anisotropic distribution function , with ultra - relativistic motion along the magnetic field lines , and non - relativistic motion across it .",
    "such distribution function is formed when the accretion flow into the magnetic pole of the neutron star is stopped in a non - collisional shock wave @xcite , and a rapid loss of transversal energy in the strong magnetic field leads to strongly anisotropic momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "it is not possible for the moment to make a definite choice between these two models .",
    "there are another models explaining the change of x - ray beam during 35 day period without obscuration of the beam by the inner edge of the accretion disk ( postnov et al . , 2013 ; staubert et al . ,",
    "therefore only observational criteria permit to make a choice between the models .",
    "in this paper we consider the problem of the observational choice between the above mentioned models by measuring the polarization of the radiation in this x - ray feature .",
    "the relativistic dipole and cyclotron radiation have different polarization properties , so such measurements could solve this long - standing problem .",
    "such experiments could be performed on the japanese satellite _ astro - h _ which launch is planned for 2015 , @xcite . for description of different ways of x - ray polarization measurements see @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the cyclotron radiation is produced during a motion of non - relativistic electrons across a magnetic field direction .",
    "it is radiated in the form of the line with the energy @xmath13 , with the cyclotron frequency    @xmath14    the electron is moving along the larmor circle with the radius    @xmath15    where the electron velocity @xmath16 is the component situated in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field in the frame connected with the larmor circle .",
    "the electron is radiating also on the harmonic frequency @xmath17 . at @xmath18",
    "the strength of the harmonic lines is rapidly decreasing with the number @xmath19 . if also the total @xmath20 , the change of cyclotron frequency due to doppler shifting may be neglected , and only the gravitational redshift in the gravitational field of the neutron star ( not present in ( [ bfield ] ) )",
    "should be taken into account for the magnetic field evaluation .",
    "taking into account only the radiation on the first harmonic of the cyclotron frequency , we have it s differential angular emissivity @xmath21 as @xcite    @xmath22    and the total emissivity , after integration over the angle and frequency , is :    @xmath23    expressions for the degrees of linear and circular polarization , respectively , are written as @xcite :    @xmath24    @xmath25    the cyclotron radiation of a single electron is totally polarized , inducing the last equality .",
    "the cyclotron radiation along the direction of the magnetic field is fully circularly polarized and in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field it s fully linearly polarized .",
    "we shall use the subscript `` 0 '' for the frame , connected with the plane of the larmor circle where @xmath26 .",

    "the observed average frequency of the rdr therefore , corresponds to @xmath104 .",
    "the effective width of the line is about @xmath105 .",

    "stress , that this form of the line is present for monoenergetic electron beam with @xmath46 equal for all electrons .",
    "this type of widening takes place only in the rdr mechanism , and the form of the magneto - dipole line may be used for distinguishing between the cyclotron and rdr mechanisms .",
    "note that in presence of other widening mechanisms the line may become even wider , but should preserve characteristic feature of this mechanism .",

    "the analysis of two model of the magneto dipole mechanism of the line formation had shown important features , by measuring of which the cyclotron model may be distinguished from the rdr model with strongly anisotropic electron distribution .",
    "the angular distribution in these models is very different , quasi - isotropic in the cyclotron model , and strongly anisotropic in rdr .",
    "nevertheless , in observing these , usually rather weak lines , it is hardly possible to obtain a definite answer about the angular distribution , due to many contaminating factors .",
    "different form of the line , and different observed light curves , predicted by theory for these lines could help more , when measured , but for weak lines it seems also very difficult .",
    "the most distinct difference between the cyclotron and rdr mechanisms of the line formation may be seen in their polarization features .",
    "the measurements of the hard x - ray polarization are discussed for more than 40 years , but still there is no space mission for these measurements .",
    "the linear x - ray polarization which is measured should be close to zero for the cyclotron radiation from the hot magnetic pole , while the radiation produced in rdr model should have about 35% of the linear polarization in the line , what is sufficiently well distinguished difference , which could be taken into account in the construction of the hard x - ray polarimeter .",

    "the line emitted by non - relativistic electrons in the magnetic field has the same cyclotron frequency .",
    "its harmonics are highly suppressed at @xmath135 , what is expected in the accretion disk and in the accretion column .",
    "the observed line width originating from photons of the relativistic dipole radiation coming from different angles is forming one broad line , contrary to separate harmonics in the cyclotron model .",
    "the second harmonic in the case of relativistic dipole radiation should form another line of almost the same width at double energy .",
    "there is still not clear wether the second `` cyclotron '' harmonics is present in the x - ray spectrum of her x1 ( trmper at al . , 1978 ;",
    "enoto et al . , 2008 ; frst et al . ,",

    "the influence of the line broadening due to the distribution over the parallel electron momentum is considered by baushev and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1999 ) . according to ( [ ppar3 ] ) ,",
    "the broadening is small when the scattering momentum is non - relativistic . with increasing of @xmath136 over @xmath137 , the broadening increases , and",
    "the resulting line broadening is the combination of the angular and scattering action .",
    "nevertheless , it is very important that for any scattering in a parallel direction the parameters of the polarization do not change for any large @xmath138 , which are considered in this model , and the criteria for the choice between models remains valid .",
