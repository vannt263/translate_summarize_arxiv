    "the development of spontaneously broken gauge theories represents a watershed in the progress of theoretical physics .",
    "such theories form not only the basis for the enormously successful standard model but also for the various attempts at a grand unified theory of strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "while the basic principles were laid down by higgs @xcite and kibble @xcite in the early 1960 s , the then available technology for quantizing the broken theory was based upon the ` unitary ( u- ) gauge ' .",
    "as it will figure prominently in our considerations let us briefly recall the u - gauge formalism .",
    "i assume here a simple gauge group @xmath0 , lie algebra @xmath1 with representatives of generators @xmath2 and structure constants @xmath3 = i{c_{abc}}{t_c}$ ] .",
    "i also denote by @xmath4 the adjoint representation @xmath5 . neglecting matter fields",
    "the general model is @xmath6 where @xmath7 note that the higgs field @xmath8 is taken to form a real representation - e.g. for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is invariant under the infinitesimal transformations @xmath12 with @xmath13 the gauge covariant derivative with respect to @xmath14 in the adjoint representation .",
    "when @xmath15 the invariance of @xmath11 is spontaneously broken through a non - trivial vacuum expectation value of the higgs field @xmath16 or in the case at hand @xmath17 . in general @xmath18 may have a subgroup @xmath19 such as to leave the vacuum invariant : @xmath20 if @xmath21 . the u - gauge transformation is then    @xmath22    yielding @xmath23 +   \\ldots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 , the ellipsis stands for @xmath25 and @xmath26-self interaction terms @xcite while @xmath27 is the vector mass matrix .",
    "the would - be goldstone bosons  the angles @xmath28 parametrizing the coset @xmath29  have disappeared from @xmath11 , being replaced by the longitudinal degree of freedom of the massive vector propagator @xmath30 \\label{eqn111}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as the name implies the u - gauge makes unitarity manifest in that only the physical degrees of freedom appear . at the same time for euclidean loop momentum @xmath31 ,",
    "@xmath32 so the transformed theory is * not * renormalizable by power counting .",
    "this does not mean that unitarity is lost any more than the symmetry is broken ; rather both are well hidden . following weinberg one",
    "says that the u - gauge is ` crypto - renormalizable ' .",
    "a modified quantization procedure enabling the renormalization of broken gauge theories was first introduced by t hooft @xcite and elaborated by lee and zinn - justin @xcite . in these renormalizable or @xmath33 gauges",
    "@xcite one begins by shifting the higgs field @xmath34 .",
    "the kinetic piece @xmath35 then gives rise to a term @xmath36 which mixes the gauge and would be goldstone fields . in order to remove this",
    "mixing one chooses a gauge fixing condition @xmath37 with @xmath38 so it is cancelled by @xmath39 now both the scalar fields and faddeev - popov ghosts acquire gauge parameter dependent mass matrices    @xmath40    but the massive gauge field propagator @xmath41 \\label{eqn115}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is well behaved , @xmath42 . hence the @xmath33 gauge is manifestly renormalizable by power counting .",
    "here the price one pays is that the would - be goldstone bosons are still around as spurious degrees of freedom .",
    "what must be shown through the use of generalized ward identities ( gwi s ) is that they as well as the other gauge dependent parts cancel in the s - matrix .",
    "thus unitarity is * not * manifest in the @xmath33 gauges ; again it is not lost but only hidden .",
    "one might sat the @xmath33 gauge is ` crypto - unitary ' .    while the conventional renormalizable gauges are sid pro quo , it is natural to inquire whether all this cryptology is necessary , or whether it is not possible to instead achieve manifest renormalizability and unitarity in a single framework . in this paper",
    "i will show that the answer is indeed yes .",
    "the resolution of the schism lies in a modification of the background field gauge ( bfg ) formalism first developed by de witt @xcite for quantization of unbroken yang - mills theories and general relativity through one - loop .",
    "subsequently the extension beyond the one - loop level to all orders was made by t hooft @xcite and abbott @xcite .",
    "as the background field method remains relatively obscure in section 2 i will briefly review the formalism for scalar fields and global symmetries following the lucid presentation of abbott @xcite ; there in i also illustrate its simplification of the proof of renormalizability .",
    "then in section 3 i review the bfg for unbroken gauge theories . in section 4",
    "i return to the problem of spontaneously broken gauge theories and show how a modified bfg leads to manifest unitarity and renormalizability .",
    "finally sections 5 presents some calculations .",
    "given a scalar @xmath43 field system and lagrangian @xmath44 such as @xmath45 above the familiar quantization procedure is to introduce external sources @xmath46 and the functionals @xmath47 & = { \\mathcal{n}^ { - 1}}\\int { \\left [ { d\\phi } \\right]\\exp \\left\\ { { i\\int { { d^4}x\\left [ { { \\mathscr{l}}\\left ( \\phi   \\right ) + { j_i}{\\phi _ i } } \\right ] } } \\right\\}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath48 & =   - i\\ln w\\left [ j \\right ] = \\gamma \\left [ \\phi   \\right ] + \\int { { d^4}x{j_i}{\\phi _ i } } \\\\ { \\phi _ i } & = \\frac{{\\delta z}}{{\\delta { j_i } } } , \\qquad { j_i } =   - \\frac{{\\delta \\gamma } } { { \\delta { \\phi _ i}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 are respectively the generators of ( connected ) greens functions and proper vertex functions .",

    "in practice of course except for very simple background fields  such as @xmath66 const . which gives the effective potential @xmath67  one can not carry out the exact evaluation of @xmath68 $ ] , but usually one only needs the moments of @xmath69 $ ] e.g. to construct the s - matrix .",
    "then in one may expand the action in the exponential in powers of @xmath70 @xmath71 = \\int { { d^4}xl\\left ( { \\phi   + \\beta } \\right ) }   = s\\left [ \\phi   \\right ] + \\int { { d^4}x{\\beta _ i}{{\\left . \\left({\\frac{{\\delta",

    "it follows immediately that the possible divergences are contained in @xmath85 = \\int { { d^4}x\\left [ { \\frac{1}{2}\\delta { \\mu ^2}{\\beta ^t}\\beta   - \\frac{1}{4}\\left ( { 1 - { z_\\lambda } } \\right){{\\left ( { { \\beta ^t}\\beta } \\right)}^2 } + \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( { 1 - { z_\\beta } } \\right)\\beta _ { , \\mu } ^t{\\beta ^{,\\mu } } } \\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are cancelled by adding counter terms : @xmath86 @xmath87 equivalent to the multiplicative renormalizations @xmath88    note particularly that nothing in the proof outlined depends upon whether @xmath89 ( wigner - weyl phase ) or @xmath15 ( nambu - goldstone phase )  provided only that one chooses an appropriate renormalization scheme ( such as minimal subtraction ) which is non - singular as @xmath90 is continued from positive to negative values the renormalizability of the symmetric phase implies the renormalizability of the asymmetric phase .",
    "for global symmetries as in the preceding section the invariance of the effective action and the renormalizability of the ( a-)symmetric phase can be proven without resort to the background field . where the method begins to come into its own is in the yang - mills theory where the definition of the generating functionals require that one break the gauge invariance erstwhile the @xmath14 field propagator is undefined .",
    "the magic of the background field method is that one can break the * quantum * field invariance while retaining background field gauge invariance provided one is clever in choosing the gauge fixing @xcite .",
    "one begins with @xmath91 = { \\mathcal{n}^ { - 1}}\\int { \\left [ { da } \\right]\\exp \\left\\ { { i\\int { { d^4}x\\left [ { { { \\mathscr{l}}_{eff}}\\left ( { a;b } \\right ) - j_a^\\mu a_\\mu ^a } \\right ] } } \\right\\}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the background field to @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the absence of gauge fixing ( @xmath95 ) there is invariance under the infinitesimal transformations @xmath96 which would be broken by the usual choice @xmath97 . on the other hand , replacing the ordinary derivative by the gauge covariant derivative with respect to the background field @xmath98 one observes that @xmath99 transforms as the adjoint representation of the gauge group @xmath100 so @xmath101 is invariant under .",
    "the faddeev - popov operator transforms similarly @xmath102    hence @xmath103 is invariant under as is @xmath104 then by identical steps as in section 2 , @xmath105 = \\gamma \\left [ b \\right ] = \\gamma \\left [ { b + \\delta b } \\right ] \\label{eqn7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] yielding the gwi s as moments of @xmath106    due to the background field gauge invariance and power counting , @xmath107 , one immediately obtains that the divergences are cancelled by the gauge invariant counter - terms @xmath108 moreover , defining the bare field and coupling @xmath109 in order that @xmath110 be invariant one has in view of the nonlinear terms the identity @xmath111 in turn this means that to calculate the @xmath70 function for qcd in the background field formalism one only needs the two point function for the @xmath112 field , as opposed to the standard methods where one requires two and three point proper vertices .",
    "beyond one loop the resulting computational advantages are enormous @xcite",
    "with the foregoing in mind we now return to the problem of spontaneously broken yang - mills theories .",
    "let us introduce background fields @xmath70 and @xmath112 for @xmath8 and @xmath14 , and consider @xmath113 = { n^ { - 1}}\\int { \\left [ { da } \\right]\\left [ { d\\phi } \\right]\\exp \\left\\ { { i\\int { { d^4}x\\left [ { { { \\mathscr{l}}_{eff}}\\left ( { a,\\phi ; b,\\beta } \\right ) + { j_i}{\\phi _ i } - j_a^\\mu a_\\mu ^a } \\right ] } } \\right\\ } }   \\label{eqn41}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 and @xmath11 is as seen in to . with @xmath95 is invariant under the simultaneous infinitesimal local transformations , and , and we seek to choose the ( quantum ) gauge fixing so as to preserve this feature .",
    "now by it self this would be accomplished by just as in the pure gauge theory .",
    "there is however a problem : @xmath115 contains a piece @xmath116    the proper vertices are found by expanding @xmath117 = \\gamma \\left [ { b + \\delta b,\\beta   + \\delta \\beta } \\right ] \\label{eqn43}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] about @xmath118 with @xmath119 a constant found by minimizing the effective potential @xmath120 =   - \\int { { d^4}xv\\left ( { { v^t}v } \\right ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently in the broken symmetry phase there occurs a mixing between the quantum gauge and would - be goldstone fields .",
    "taking a clue @xcite from t hooft , the way out of this difficulty is apparent : we introduce a modified background field gauge fixing function , replacing @xmath99 of by @xmath121 which also transforms as the adjoint representation of the gauge group under and , insuring the background field invariance of @xmath122 as well as @xmath123 crucially and also assure the cancellation of the quantum mixing piece in the broken symmetry phase , @xmath124 .",
    "let us see what we have accomplished ; first , the internal ( @xmath14 field ) gauge propagator assumes the form and the gwi s are from @xmath125 the background field invariance together with power counting @xmath126 means that the proof of renormalizability goes through for the coupled higgs scalar - gauge field system as for its component parts ( replacing the ordinary by the gauge covariant derivative in ) .",
    "thus * renormalizability is manifest*.    second , because we have retained the background field gauge invariance , we can perform a unitary gauge transformation on the background fields :    @xmath127    so @xmath117",
    "\\to \\gamma \\left [ { b , v + \\eta } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath128 $ ] to generate the proper vertex functions the background would be goldstone bosons never appear in the s - matrix , the massive background gauge field propagator being that of plus loop corrections . hence also * unitarity is manifest *",
    "in this paper i have shown how the background field formalism and a simple modification of the conventional background field gauge allows one to rectify the usual schism between unitarity and renormalizability for spontaneously broken gauge theories .",
    "it has further been demonstrated that the background field method leads to much simpler and elegant proofs than in the conventional approach .",
    "it is also to be hoped that , esoterics aside , the method leads to computational simplifications in spontaneously broken theories in the same that it has for e.g. the @xmath70 function in unbroken yang - mills theory .",
    "this aspect is currently under investigation",
    "i would like to thank j. reid for having first introduced me to the elegance of the background field method .",
    "this includes a part @xmath129 arising from the transformation of the measure where @xmath130 is the order of the coset @xmath29 . in @xmath131 dimensions",
    "this piece effects the cancellation of quartic divergences , @xmath132 , while it vanishes in dimensional regularization .",
    "a related idea is the nonlinear @xmath33 gauge in which the ordinary derivative in the @xmath33 gauge condition is replaced by a gauge covariant derivative with respect to the quantum field and the unbroken subgroup @xmath19 .",
