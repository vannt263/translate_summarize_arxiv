    "in fmri , a functional map is an important representation of how cognitive function is related to neuroanatomy .",
    "such maps provide a topographic representation of the brain regions that are ( and are not ) systematically responsive to differing values of a cognitive variable .",
    "the size , shape , number and location of the  blobs \" ( i.e. , voxel - clusters meeting some statistical relevance criterion ) on the functional maps are the basis for inferences about the neural substrates of the cognitive process . given the importance of functional maps , there is a continuing need to scrutinize the sensitivity , precision and technical assumptions of the mapping procedure itself .",
    "the topic of the current technical note is the mapping procedure used to generate the widely used",
    "_ information maps _ @xcite .",
    "the motivation for information mapping is the statistical concern that a region s responses to the cognitive variable under study might take a complex multivariate form . for example , a group of multiple voxels might conjointly respond in a task - relevant manner even though individual voxels may not detectably do so @xcite .",
    "such distributed response patterns might be effectively undetectable with conventional univariate statistical tests restricted to individual voxel responses , but detectable with an explicit multivariate test for multivoxel response patterns , i.e. , using some multivoxel pattern analysis ( mvpa ) technique . to address this concern in the context of functional mapping",
    ", @xcite proposed a simple procedure to enable sophisticated mvpa methods to be readily applied to detect and map brain regions that contain information about the experimental conditions , irrespective of whether the informative responses are univariate or multivariate .    in the proposed procedure ,",
    "the unit of evaluation is not the single voxel but a  searchlight \"  the _ group _ of voxels contained in a spherical neighborhood of radius @xmath0 around a single voxel .",
    "the searchlight statistic is a measure of whether the conjoint responses of this group of voxels contain information about the experimental conditions being tested .",
    "based on these abstractions , an information map is generated as follows : the searchlight statistic is evaluated for searchlights centered at _ every _ voxel in the brain ; and the statistic s value for each searchlight is mapped to the central voxel of that searchlight . the resulting topographic representation generated by the searchlight - procedure",
    "has been referred to as the information map .",
    "such searchlight - based information maps are now routinely reported in studies that employ mvpa methods ( for example , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    notwithstanding their popularity ,",
    "interpreting a searchlight - based information map presents a variety of challenges @xcite .",
    "one such challenge is posed by the topographic ambiguity of the information map .",
    "recall that a searchlight statistic computed on the responses of an entire multivoxel searchlight is mapped to a single voxel on the information map , namely , that searchlight s central voxel .",
    "this mapping protocol is applied to searchlights across the brain irrespective of the number or the spatial locations of the information - carrying voxels _ within _ each searchlight .",
    "consequently , the spatial position of an informative voxel on the information maps is a coarse index to the actual location of the informative  pattern \" within that voxel s searchlight .",
    "furthermore , since a searchlight has a unique central voxel @xmath1 , an informative voxel on the information map is not indicative of the actual number of voxels constituting the informative pattern within that voxel s searchlight neighborhood . given these properties of the information map",
    ", we asked : what , if anything , can be reliably inferred about the size and shape of a multivoxel pattern from its corresponding signature on the information map ?",
    "previous studies have treated this question as a qualitative concern requiring cautious interpretation .",
    "nonetheless , here we show that information maps are in fact subject to several crisply quantitative geometric constraints that strongly govern how such maps can be interpreted .",
    "our analytical results are based on a simple geometric intuition . since a multivoxel searchlight",
    "is defined at every voxel across the brain , searchlights centered at different voxels systematically overlap each other , i.e. , have voxels in common . using overlapping searchlights",
    "is crucial to obtain a continuous topographic coverage especially when the locations and spatial extents of voxel - neighborhoods that are task - responsive are unknown a priori .",
    "we observed that due to these overlaps , multiple searchlights would be deemed informative merely by virtue of sharing the task - relevant multivoxel response patterns .",
    "thus we reasoned that the size and shape of a multivoxel group @xmath2 s signature on the information map should be defined by exactly those voxels which have searchlight - neighborhoods that contain @xmath2 .",
    "using this observation and simple geometric reasoning , we formally deduce some key properties of the relationship between an informative pattern and its corresponding signature on the information map .    based on our formal analysis",
    ", we prove here that , for any searchlight radius , a single task - responsive voxel produces a larger signature on the information map as compared to a distributed multivoxel response pattern .",
    "furthermore , the number of informative searchlights over the brain can increase as a function of searchlight radius , without necessarily revealing any new information and even in the complete absence of _ any _ multivariate response patterns .",
    "importantly , these properties are largely independent of the type of machine - learning algorithm or the testing protocol used to compute the searchlight statistic .",
    "the basis of the searchlight analysis is the geometric structure of the voxel - space in which the brain images are defined .",
    "the voxel - space @xmath3 is defined here as the set of all voxels @xmath4 augmented with a geometric structure defining the relative spatial position of the voxels in @xmath4 , and a distance measure between these voxels . for analytical convenience ,",
    "we treat the voxel - space as being _ uniform _ and _ connected _ as described below .    a @xmath5-dimensional voxel - space @xmath3 is deemed to be _ uniform _ if every voxel has a neighboring voxel in all @xmath5 principal directions .",
    "additionally , we assume that the voxel - space @xmath3 is _",
    "connected_. specifically , there is a path connecting every pair of voxels @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath3 with a path defined here to be an ordered sequence of voxels @xmath8 where voxel @xmath9 is a neighbor of @xmath10 along one of the @xmath5 principal directions .",
    "these simplifying assumptions are intended to emphasize the general geometric principles entailed by the searchlight method while deliberately ignoring the special cases associated with ( i ) the boundaries of @xmath3 where a searchlight may be truncated ; and ( ii ) distinctions between gray - matter and white - matter voxels and any masking of the latter from the searchlights .",
    "although we refer to searchlights as being volumes in a voxel - space having dimensionality @xmath11 , the properties derived here are agnostic to the specific value of @xmath5 and apply to surfaces ( @xmath12 ) where the searchlights are discs ( as in , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the key abstraction defined by the searchlight method is a decomposition of @xmath3 into subsets of voxels based on a geometric criterion . given a voxel space @xmath3",
    ", we define a searchlight voxel - decomposition using the following indexing function @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the powerset of @xmath3 , namely , the set of all subsets of @xmath3 .",
    "this indexing function @xmath15 takes two inputs  the identity of a voxel @xmath1 in the voxel - space @xmath3 , and a real - value @xmath16 specifying the searchlight s radius .",
    "the searchlight indexing function uses these parameters in conjunction with the geometric structure of @xmath3 to extract and output a set of voxels @xmath17 .",
    "a voxel @xmath18 is a member of @xmath19 if and only if the distance between @xmath20 and @xmath1 is less than or equal to @xmath0 . for convenience ,",
    "we henceforth write @xmath21 to denote the searchlight @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting _ searchlight voxel - decomposition _ of @xmath3 for a given radius @xmath0 is defined as @xmath23    for clarity , we restrict our usage of the term  searchlight \" to the cases when the value of the radius of a searchlight @xmath0 is such that each @xmath24 is a _ multivoxel _",
    "entity that is not identical with @xmath3 , that is , @xmath25 , for any @xmath26 .",
    "we refer to the univariate case where @xmath27 as the univoxel decomposition .",
    "a schematic of the searchlight indexing scheme is shown in figure [ fig : voxelspace ] .",
    "the searchlight statistic is a measure of whether the voxels in the searchlight , as a unit , exhibit differences in their conjoint responses to the experimental conditions .",
    "more generally , it is a measure of whether the searchlight contains information about the experimental condition , i.e. , whether the searchlight is informative . as with the radius of the searchlight , the specific statistical procedure used to compute",
    "the searchlight statistic is a discretionary choice made by the researcher ( for example , see * ? ? ?",
    "to describe the searchlight statistic in a procedure - independent manner , we use a binary indicator function , which we refer to as the _ informativeness _ function , @xmath28 . given a subset of voxels @xmath29",
    ", the function @xmath30 returns a value of @xmath31 if the responses of @xmath2 are deemed to be informative ; or @xmath32 if they are not , based on some appropriately specified statistical criterion .",
    "evaluating the informativeness function on the responses corresponding to each searchlight @xmath21 in @xmath33 defines the overall information set for a particular radius @xmath34    the _ information map _ is the object obtained when the information set defined above is augmented with the geometric structure of the voxel - space @xmath3 by mapping the informativeness value of each searchlight @xmath35 to its corresponding central voxel @xmath1 .",
    "the performance measure of interest here is the total number of informative searchlights for a particular searchlight decomposition @xmath36      two simple properties link the structure of the searchlight decomposition @xmath33 to the structure of the information set @xmath37 .",
    "the first property is that , by virtue of the regularity of their shape and relative positioning , searchlights in @xmath33 can overlap .",
    "consequently , the same voxels in @xmath3 can be included or sampled by multiple searchlights .",
    "the second property is that since a sphere is an arbitrarily chosen and regular shape , it is unlikely that every voxel is necessarily task - relevant in every informative searchlight .",
    "consequently , the informativeness of the responses in some particular searchlight volume @xmath21 can be alternatively and accurately interpreted as indicating that _ some _ group of voxels in that searchlight volume exhibits task - dependent responses .",
    "these two properties can be combined as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 be a group of task - relevant voxels in a searchlight @xmath21 , where @xmath38 .",
    "since searchlights share voxels , if some other searchlight @xmath39 also contains @xmath2 , that is @xmath40 , then it implies that @xmath39 should also contain task - relevant information as it includes the task - relevant voxels @xmath2 .",
    "based on this observation , we make two linking assumptions about the behavior of the procedures used to compute the searchlight statistic and hence the informativeness function @xmath30 .",
    "the first is that we restrict the focus of our analysis to the common multivariate procedure that does include geometric information about the relative spatial positions of the voxels in a searchlight while computing that searchlight s informativeness .",
    "the second is the _ superset informativeness _ ( sin ) assumption which postulates that :    * superset informativeness assumption * : _ if a group of voxels @xmath2 is informative then every searchlight that contains @xmath2 is also informative .",
    "_    that is , according to the sin assumption , if @xmath41 then @xmath42 for all @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath38 . unless otherwise stated , we will overload the symbol @xmath30 to denote an informativeness function that explicitly satisfies these two model requirements .",
    "although the sin assumption is based is on a sound deduction , the empirical requirement that it poses may not necessarily be satisfied in practice . specifically ,",
    "even if it is known that @xmath45 , the statistical procedure used to evaluate informativeness might fail to detect that a searchlight @xmath21 is informative even if @xmath46 .",
    "such a type ii error ( i.e. , failing to reject a false null hypothesis that @xmath47 ) might occur for any of a variety of reasons , for example , the use of an inappropriate machine - learning algorithm @xcite , insufficient power due to a limited number of samples , and so on . in this regard ,",
    "the sin assumption treats the multivoxel pattern analysis techniques as being more sensitive and reliable than might actually be the case in practice .",
    "that is , the sin assumption allows us to establish the information map s properties in the best - case independent of the performance idiosyncrasies of the specific multivariate method being used .",
    "our focus of the current section is to establish how the structure of the sampling bias arises from the searchlight decomposition .",
    "we first prove that due to the geometric regularities of a searchlight decomposition , single - voxels and multivoxel groups are sampled with different frequencies , i.e. , included in a different number of searchlights .",
    "specifically , single voxels are included in more searchlights than multivoxel groups .",
    "this sampling difference is independent of the searchlight radius .",
    "we then extend these results to prove that the frequency with which voxel - groups are sampled increases with the radius of the searchlights , irrespective of the number of voxels in the group .",
    "finally , we prove that the information map mirrors these sampling biases in an optimistic manner , i.e. , in a manner that is not necessarily warranted by the data .      the regularity in the shape of the searchlights and their relative positions the voxel - space define a systematic relationship between each voxel @xmath48 and the searchlights in @xmath33 that contain that voxel @xmath1 .",
    "firstly , if a voxel @xmath49 is a member of the searchlight @xmath50 , then by symmetry , the voxel @xmath51 is a member of the searchlight @xmath52 ( lemma [ prop : symmetry ] ) . secondly , two distinct voxels @xmath49 and @xmath51 are not simultaneously included in every searchlight that contains either of these voxels ( lemma [ prop : twovoxel ] ) .

    "the previous two simulations demonstrated signal - dependent effects caused by the sampling bias inherent in the searchlight decomposition .",
    "however , according to theorem [ thm : monotone ] , there should be a monotonic increase in the number of informative searchlights as a function of radius , irrespective of the actual distribution of task - relevant voxels / voxel - groups across the brain .",
    "this monotonic scaling of the size of the  blobs \" on the information map makes plausible a rather unusual scenario  an information map where _ every _ searchlight in the brain is deemed to be informative .",
    "this scenario was motivated by results recently reported by @xcite . in that study ,",
    "information maps were generated using searchlights of radius @xmath114 mm and @xmath116 mm .",
    "rather remarkably , with a radius of @xmath116 mm , only one region in the information map ( the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) was found to be _ uninformative _ while every other searchlight was informative .",
    "this whole - brain coverage was , however , not the case with the @xmath114 mm searchlights .",
    "given the inflationary relationship between @xmath99 ( the number of informative searchlights ) and searchlight radius @xmath0 that established in the previous sections , curiosity asked : could an informative whole - brain arise ( i.e. , @xmath149 ) by random chance with a suitably chosen searchlight radius ?",
    "this question can be formulated as a covering problem .",
    "consider a finite 3d voxel space corresponding to one containing the brain , approximated as a cubic volume of size @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the number of voxels along the principal direction @xmath152 .",
    "suppose there is a minimum covering set of searchlights @xmath153 such that every voxel in @xmath3 is contained in some searchlight in @xmath154 .",
    "recall that a single - voxel signal can produce a cluster having @xmath64 voxels on the information map , due to theorem [ cor : corsym ] .",
    "if the central voxel of each of the searchlights in @xmath154 was informative , it would follow that searchlights centered at every voxel in every one of the searchlights in @xmath154 would also be informative .",
    "since every voxel in @xmath3 is present in some searchlight in @xmath154 , it implies that a rather sparse distribution of informative single - voxels specified by @xmath154 could produce an information map where _ every _ searchlight in @xmath33 would be informative ( with the proviso that the sin assumption holds true . )",
    "the sparsity of these informative single - voxels can be readily approximated if we use cubical volumes as a proxy for the spherical shape of the searchlight volumes .",
    "a cube of side @xmath155 voxels would fully contain a sphere having radius @xmath156 , and would be fully contained in a sphere of radius @xmath157 . with this simplification , the minimal number of searchlight cubes required to cover the voxel space @xmath3 is readily approximated as the volume of the voxel space divided by the volume of each searchlight cube , that is , @xmath158 .    for voxels of size @xmath159 mm@xmath160 , we approximate the size of the voxel space with the following values @xmath161 voxels , @xmath162 voxels and @xmath163 voxels .",
    "figure [ fig : fillingvol ] shows the minimum number of cubical volumes required to cover @xmath3 as a function of @xmath155 , where @xmath155 took values @xmath164 .",
    "a searchlight cube of side @xmath165 is equivalent to a single voxel so the size of the covering set @xmath154 is equal to the total number of voxels in @xmath3 , namely , @xmath166 .",
    "however , increasing values of @xmath155 produce a rapid decrease in the size of the covering set . for @xmath167 voxels , a cubical volume that would fully contain a spherical searchlight of radius @xmath114 mm",
    ", a total of @xmath168 equally spaced signal - carrying voxels can produce an information map where every searchlight is informative .",
    "however , for a cubical volume with side @xmath169 voxels , corresponding to spherical volumes of radius @xmath116 mm , a mere @xmath170 voxels are required for such a fully informative map",
    ". stated differently , an information map with a single task - relevant cluster made up of every voxel in @xmath3 can be generated from a mere @xmath170 regularly spaced voxels of the @xmath171 voxels in @xmath3 , that is , @xmath170 voxels that enable the conditions to be distinguished whether due to the presence of true signal or by random chance .",
    "this potential for a small number of single voxels ( i.e. , @xmath172 of @xmath173 ) to drive the structure of the entire information map simply by the choice of the searchlight radius presents an important consideration for drawing neurobiological interpretation .",
    "knowledge of the actual information - carrying voxels in each informative searchlight would make the information map irrelevant .",
    "these actual informative voxels could be directly reported , hence resolving the over - counting that arises from their inclusion in multiple searchlights .",
    "one possible implementation would be to identify task - relevant voxels in each searchlight , and then combine these identified voxels across searchlights .",
    "however , requiring the identification of the actual informative voxels in each searchlight could reduce the generality of the searchlight method . when pattern classifiers are used to compute the searchlight statistic , each voxel ( or feature ) in a searchlight is typically assigned a weight , and the weighted combination of the multivoxel responses is used to make a classification decision",
    "however , the specific basis for assigning weights to individual features is highly dependent on the specific machine learning algorithm and its inductive assumptions @xcite .",
    "consequently , appropriate techniques would be required to allow results to be compared across studies that use different mvpa - techniques .",
    "until such advances are made , the analytical framework described above provides several constraints on alternate interpretations of the information map .",
    "our results present a strong argument against measuring the sensitivity of information mapping by a count of the number of informative searchlights .",
    "the seemingly high sensitivity of the searchlight method as judged by such a performance measure in part has a rather trivial explanation .",
    "specifically , an explanation in the obligatory geometric properties of the searchlight - method as discussed above rather than an explanation related to underlying neural organization , or the sophisticated machine - learning algorithms used to analyze multivoxel response patterns , or the widely discussed merits of multivariate statistical evaluations .",
    "indeed , the upshot of the optimistic scaling of this performance measure is that it is maximal when explicitly assuming a highly sensitive and robust mvpa technique , namely one satisfying the superset informativeness ( sin ) assumption .",
