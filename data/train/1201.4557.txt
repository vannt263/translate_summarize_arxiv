    "solar prominences are one the most intriguing manifestations of solar activity .",
    "these structures consist of large clouds of plasma , two orders of magnitude cooler and denser than the surrounding corona , suspended against gravity by forces thought to be of magnetic origin .",
    "the physical properties of prominence plasmas are akin to those of the chromospheric plasma , hence some as yet not well determined mechanisms must provide the required thermal isolation and hydrodynamic support during lifetimes that last from days to weeks . the nature of solar prominences is closely linked to their sub - resolution structuring .",
    "early studies by @xcite and @xcite already pointed out that prominences are composed by many fine threads .",
    "this has been confirmed by more recent high - resolution observations obtained by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the fine threads are made of cool absorbing material , believed to outline magnetic flux tubes @xcite .",
    "their average width is about 04 , their length is in between 5 and 40 , and they have lifetimes of up to 20 minutes .    the measurement of physical properties of prominence plasmas by direct observation is challenging . an alternative to gain knowledge about the physical conditions in prominences",
    "is the combined use of observed and theoretical wave properties .",
    "the presence of waves and oscillations in solar prominences is known since a long time ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "individual threads or groups of them oscillate with periods that range between 3 and 20 minutes .",
    "a recurrently observed property of prominence oscillations is their rapid temporal damping , with perturbations decaying in time - scales of only a few oscillatory periods .",
    "another relevant characteristic of waves in solar prominences is the ubiquitous presence of flows @xcite .",
    "flow speeds in the range 525 km  s@xmath0 are usually reported in quiescent filament threads , while in active region threads flow speeds of up to 50 km  s@xmath0 are detected @xcite .",
    "transverse thread oscillations are commonly interpreted in terms of standing or propagating mhd kink waves .",
    "the mhd wave interpretation of thread oscillations has allowed the development of theoretical models ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical damping mechanisms have also been developed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "as information on geometrical properties , damping mechanisms , and flows are incorporated in theoretical models for mhd wave studies , more refined results are obtained that allow a better implementation of prominence seismology .",
    "solar atmospheric seismology aims to determine physical parameters in magnetic and plasma structures that are difficult to measure by direct means .",
    "it is a remote diagnostics method that combines observations of oscillations and waves in magnetic structures , together with theoretical results from the analysis of oscillatory properties of models of those structures .",
    "it was first suggested by @xcite and @xcite , in the coronal context , and by @xcite in the prominence context .",
    "the systematic of mhd seismology is displayed in figure  [ fig : sismology ] .",
    "observations of solar coronal magnetic and plasma structures provide us with information from which theoretical models about their equilibrium can be constructed . on the other hand",
    ", observations also provide us with measurements of certain properties , such as periods , damping times , or flow speeds . by analyzing the wave properties of given theoretical models",
    "they can be compared to the observed wave properties . if we find a perfect agreement between observed and theoretical wave properties we can aim to derive some unknown physical parameters of interest .",
    "meanwhile , we can test and improve our models or find constraints .",
    "this article discusses three tools for the application of mhd prominence seismology , with an emphasis on the _ hinode _ contribution to the area .",
    "a recent application of the prominence seismology technique , using the period of observed filament thread transverse oscillations can be found in @xcite .",
    "these authors find observational evidence about swaying motions of individual filament threads from high resolution observations obtained with the swedish 1-m solar telescope in la palma .",
    "the presence of waves propagating along individual threads was already evident in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that line - of - sight oscillations are observed in prominences beyond the limb , as well as in filaments against the disk , suggests that the planes of the oscillation may acquire various orientations relative to the local solar reference system .",
    "for this reason , @xcite combine simultaneous recordings of motions in the line of sight and in the plane of the sky , which leads to information about the orientation of the oscillatory plane in each case .",
    "periodic oscillatory signals are obtained in a number of threads , that are next fitted to sine curves , from which the period and the amplitude of the waves are derived .",
    "the presence of different cuts along the structures allow @xcite to obtain the phase difference between the fitted curves , which can be used to measure the phase velocities of the waves .",
    "the overall periods and mean velocity amplitudes that are obtained correspond to short period , @xmath1 3.6 minutes , and small amplitude @xmath2 km  s@xmath0 oscillations .",
    "the information obtained from these h@xmath3 filtergrams in the plane of the sky is combined with h@xmath3 dopplergrams , which allow to detect oscillations in the line - of - sight direction . by combining the observed oscillations in the two orthogonal directions",
    "the full vectors are derived , which show that the oscillatory planes are close to the vertical .",
    "@xcite interpret the observed swaying thread oscillations as mhd kink waves supported by the thread body . by assuming the classic one - dimensional , straight , flux tube model a comparison between the observed wave properties and the theoretical prediction can be made in order to obtain the physical parameters of interest , namely the alfvn speed and the magnetic field strength in the studied threads . to this end",
    "the observed phase speed is directly associated to the kink speed , which in the limit of high density contrast , typical of filament plasmas , is simply reduced to @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the prominence alfvn speed .",
    "this allows to obtain the thread alfvn speed through @xmath6 .",
    "the obtained values for a set of 10 threads can be found in table  2 in @xcite .",
    "once the alfvn speed in each thread is determined , the magnetic field strength can be computed , if a given internal density is assumed . for a typical value of @xmath7 kg m@xmath8 magnetic field strengths in between 0.93.5  g",
    "are obtained , for the analyzed events .",
    "the important conclusion that we extract from the analysis by @xcite is that prominence seismology is possible and works well , provided high resolution observations are available .",
    "the damping of prominence oscillations is a clear feature in many observed events .",
    "@xcite show that the amplitudes of the waves passing through two different cuts along a thread are notably different . among the different damping mechanisms that have been put forward in order to explain the damping of mhd oscillations in prominence plasmas resonant absorption in the alfvn continuum seems a very plausible one .",
    "the mechanism relies on the non - uniformity of the medium in the transverse direction .",
    "it was suggested to explain the damping of transverse kink waves in prominence threads by @xcite .",
    "the damping of wave modes can be used as an additional source of information about the physical properties of prominence plasmas . in the context of transversely oscillating coronal loops",
    "this was done by and .",
    "their analytical and numerical inversion schemes make use of the simple idea that it is the same magnetic structure , whose equilibrium conditions we are interested to assess , that is oscillating with a given period and undergoing a given damping rate . by computing the kink normal mode frequency and damping time as a function of the relevant equilibrium parameters for a one - dimensional model , the period , @xmath9 and damping ratio , @xmath10 , have the following dependencies @xmath11 with @xmath5 the internal alfvn speed , @xmath12 the longitudinal wavenumber , @xmath13 the density contrast , and @xmath14 the transverse inhomogeneity length - scale , in units of the tube radius , @xmath15 . in the case of coronal loop oscillations ,",
    "an estimate for @xmath12 can be obtained directly from the length of the loop and the fact that the fundamental kink mode wavelength is twice this quantity . for filament threads ,",
    "the wavelength of oscillations needs to be measured .",
    "relations  [ relations ] indicate that , if no assumption is made on any of the physical parameters of interest , we have two observed quantities , period and damping time , and three unknowns , density contrast , transverse inhomogeneity length - scale , and alfvn speed .",
    "there are therefore infinite different equilibrium models that can equally well explain the observations .",
    "these valid equilibrium models delineate a one - dimensional solution curve in the three - dimensional parameter space ( @xmath16 , @xmath14 , @xmath5 ) . when partially filled threads , with the dense part occupying a length @xmath17 shorter than the total length of the tube @xmath18 are considered , the period and damping time of thread oscillations are seen to depend on @xmath19 .",
    "then , one of such curves is obtained for each value of the length of the thread . the solutions to the inverse problem",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seismology]a for a set of values for @xmath17 . it can be appreciated that , even if each curve gives an infinite number of solutions , they define a rather constrained range of values for the thread alfvn speed .",
    "this figure also shows that the ratio @xmath19 is a fundamental parameter in order to perform an accurate seismology of prominence threads .",
    "because of the insensitiveness of the damping ratio with density contrast , for the typically large values of this parameter in prominence plasmas , the obtained solution curves display an asymptotic behavior for large values of @xmath16 .",
    "this allows us to obtain precise estimates for the filament thread alfvn speed and the transverse inhomogeneity length scale in that limit for each of the curves .",
    "the computation of the magnetic field strength from the obtained seismological curve requires the assumption of a particular value for either the filament or the coronal density .",
    "the resulting curves for a typical coronal density and several values of @xmath19 are shown in figure  [ fig : seismology]b .",
    "as can be seen , precise values of the magnetic field strength can not be obtained , unless the density contrast is accurately known .",
    "the question of whether propagating disturbances detected in chromospheric and coronal structures are waves or flows has become a hot topic that demands for both observational and theoretical assessment in order to perform an accurate seismology .",
    "the contribution of _ hinode _ to the subject has been of central importance .",
    "flows constitute and additional source of information about the physical conditions of oscillating structures in conjunction to oscillating periods and damping times .",
    "the first seismological application of prominence seismology using _ hinode _ observations of flowing and transversely oscillating threads was presented by @xcite , using observations obtained in an active region filament by @xcite .",
    "the observations show a number of threads that flow following a path parallel to the photosphere while they are oscillating in the vertical direction .",
    "the relevance of this particular event is in the fact that the coexistence of waves and flows can be firmly established , so there is no ambiguity about the wave or flow character of a given dynamic feature .",
    "we have both of them in this particular example . @xcite",
    "analyze 6 threads and table  1 displays the relevant measured quantities .    a detailed view of the event analyzed by @xcite shows that when a given thread is selected and several cuts along its structure are analyzed as a function of time , oscillations that are synchronous along the entire length of the thread are found .",
    "this means that the maximum and minimum amplitudes occur at nearly the same time for all locations .",
    "this led @xcite to interpret these oscillations in terms of the kink mode of a magnetic flux tube .    .68em",

    "find that , although it is not possible to univocally determine the physical parameters of interest , a one - to - one relation between the thread alfvn speed and the coronal alfvn speed can be established .",
    "this relation comes in the form of a number of curves relating the two alfvn speeds for different values of the length of the magnetic flux tube and the density contrast between the filament and coronal plasma .",
    "figure  [ fig : hinode ] shows the derived values by changing the length of the tube from bottom to top and the density contrast , from left to right .",
    "an interesting property of the obtained curves is that they display an asymptotic behavior for large values of the density contrast , typical of filament to coronal plasmas , and hence a lower limit for the thread alfvn speed can be obtained .",
    "take for instance thread # 6 .",
    "considering a length of the total magnetic flux tube of @xmath25 mm , an overall value between 120 and 350  km  s@xmath0 for the thread alfvn speed is obtained .",
    "next mass flows are considered .",
    "first a simple approximation is made .",
    "consider the form in which mass flow along the cylinder , @xmath21 , enters in the linear mhd waves equations through the differential operator @xmath26 the terms coming from the equilibrium flow can , in a first approximation , be ignored because , as noted by @xcite , inside the cylinder the terms with derivatives along the tube are much smaller than those with radial or azimuthal derivatives . by following this approach the problem reduces to solving a time - dependent problem with a varying density profile , @xmath27 , representing a dense part moving along the tube with the flow speed .",
    "after solving the two - dimensional wave equations one finds that the flow velocities measured by @xcite result in slightly shorter kink mode periods than the ones derived in the absence of flow .",
    "differences are however small and we find period shifts in between 3 and 5% .    finally , a more complete approach to the problem has been followed by @xcite who consider the numerical solution of the full mhd wave equations , with no further approximations .",
    "the thin tube approximation is not used , the flow is maintained in the equations .",
    "also the density is allowed to change in the simulation as a nonlinear code is used .",
    "the full numerical result confirms the previous approximate results regarding the effect of the flow on the obtained periods , and therefore , on the derived alfvn speed values .",
    "this paper presents recent developments of the mhd seismology technique applied to prominence plasmas .",
    "the combination of refined theoretical models for prominence thread oscillations together with observations allows for the estimation of difficult to measure quantities in these objects .",
    "three complementary techniques for the inversion of physical parameters have been discussed .",
    "they make use of the mhd kink wave interpretation for transverse oscillations in filament and active region threads together with observational estimates for quantities such as periods , damping rates , and mass flow speeds . in general , the solution to the inverse problem is unable to provide a single value for all the parameters of interest , since the quantity of unknowns outnumbers that of measured wave properties . however , estimates of physical parameters in a narrow range of values can be derived .",
    "a proper further development of prominence seismology requires improvements in both theory and observations .",
    "our example using _ hinode _ observations demonstrates that high quality observations and proper theoretical analysis allow flows and waves to become two useful characteristics for our understanding of the nature of solar prominences .",
