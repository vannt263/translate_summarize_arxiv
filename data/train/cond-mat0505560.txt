    "in the first paper of this series ( i ) , the hypersonic attenuation of highly densified silica glass , @xmath0-sio@xmath1 , was investigated .",
    "it was found that in that material the damping of hypersound is completely dominated by its _ anharmonic interaction _ with the thermally dominant modes . in the present paper",
    "we consider the corresponding situation in usual vitreous silica , @xmath2-sio@xmath1 , for which a large quantity of high quality data is already available in the literature . in the early 1950 s ,",
    "ultrasonic absorption peaks in function of the temperature @xmath3 were first observed in @xmath2-sio@xmath1 .",
    "these were described by anderson and bmmel in terms of a phenomenological maxwell model @xcite . following the discovery of the key role played by two - level systems ( tls ) in producing the anomalous thermal properties of glasses @xcite , it became clear that these should also be invoked in the description of acoustic relaxation .",
    "a theory including both resonant and relaxational sound damping produced by tunneling was developed by jckle @xcite .",
    "it was then extended to higher temperatures by including in the description the classical jumps over the energy barrier separating the wells of tls @xcite .",
    "the presently accepted model for thermally activated relaxation ( tar ) includes a distribution of asymmetric double - well potentials , as discussed by gilroy and phillips @xcite .    the simple extrapolation of this behavior to ghz frequencies , _",
    "i.e. _ to the hypersonic regime , has sometimes been presented as an appropriate description of the observed phenomena , _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "however , it has also been recognized that tar might not always be sufficient to account for sound dispersion and damping .",
    "a specific example has been discussed in the case of vitreous germania , geo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the results presented in ( i ) strongly suggest that @xmath2-sio@xmath1 should be an excellent candidate to search for a possible anharmonic contribution to the hypersonic attenuation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the phenomenology of tar is reviewed to formulate a description that can reasonably be extrapolated to sufficiently high-@xmath3 and to brillouin - scattering frequencies . in section",
    "iii this formalism is applied to available high quality sonic and ultrasonic data on @xmath2-sio@xmath1 , covering more than four orders of magnitude in the frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the model parameters that are thus extracted are then used in section iv to estimate the tar contributions to both velocity dispersion and damping at brillouin - scattering frequencies .",
    "the anharmonic contribution can then be extracted from the total signal .",
    "it is analyzed in terms of a mean thermal mode relaxation time @xmath5 in section v. interestingly , this time is found to be about an order of magnitude longer than that of densified silica glass , @xmath0-sio@xmath1 .",
    "section vi presents a synthesis of the above analysis for the entire range of @xmath4 , from ultrasonic to brillouin - scattering frequencies . a part of that analysis concerns the velocity changes with @xmath3 .",
    "we find an anomalous increase of the bare velocity @xmath6 with @xmath3 , nearly the same in @xmath2-sio@xmath1 and @xmath0-sio@xmath1 .",
    "this unrelaxed velocity , @xmath6 , is obtained after subtraction of the velocity changes produced by both thermally activated relaxation and anharmonicity .",
    "the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath6 suggests that silica experiences a progressive structural change with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "section vii is a discussion , which mentions the crossovers between the various frequency regimes , considers the suitability of power laws for the description of the dependence of the damping on @xmath4 , and evoques possible extension to other glasses .",
    "we consider an assembly of defects represented by double - well potentials that are separated by barriers of height @xmath7 and whose depths differ by the asymmetry @xmath8 .",
    "the energies @xmath7 and @xmath8 are randomly distributed according to a distribution @xmath9 to be discussed below .",
    "the system is thought to hop continuously between the wells .",
    "the energy difference between the wells is coupled to the strain @xmath10 of a sound wave of angular frequency @xmath11 by a deformation potential @xmath12 . owing to the delayed energy exchanged in hopping , this produces the dissipation of the sound wave .",
    "this situation has been described in great details elsewhere @xcite . to an excellent approximation",
    ", it leads to a relaxational contribution to the internal friction given by    @xmath13 in this expression , @xmath14 is the material density , @xmath2 is the velocity of sound , and @xmath3 is in energy units .",
    "we remark that both @xmath15 and @xmath2 depend on the polarization of the acoustic wave , longitudinal ( la ) or transverse ( ta ) . in this writing , @xmath7 is restricted to positive values while the distribution is symmetric in @xmath8 .",
    "we also note that @xmath9 is a density , _",
    "i.e. _ a number per unit volume . the associated velocity change , which follows from the kramers - kronig relation , is given by @xmath16    in these equations , @xmath17 is the relaxation time for hopping within the double well .",
    "it is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the inverse of an attempt frequency , as shown in detail _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite .",
    "the key in applying these expressions is to use a reasonable distribution @xmath20 . for small @xmath8 and @xmath7 the distribution",
    "is often replaced by a constant @xmath21 .",
    "this is suggested by the @xmath3-dependence of the specific heat at low @xmath3 which only probes low values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "of course , a constant @xmath21 can not be extended to high values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 as this leads to a diverging integral density of defects which is unphysical . a reasonable guess for @xmath20",
    "can be obtained with the help of the soft - potential model ( spm ) @xcite .",
    "that model is characterized by a distribution of random dimensionless cubic and quadratic coefficients , @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , by an energy scale of the potential @xmath24 , and by a characteristic cross - over energy @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we are only interested here in the region @xmath26 with @xmath27 which gives double wells with barriers centered at the origin of the soft mode coordinate @xmath28 . as shown in @xcite , owing to the latter choice , the variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not statistically independent .",
    "this leads to a sea - gull singularity in their distribution , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is finite near the origin . for the range of values of interest here",
    ", one has @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the deformation potential of the spm is also function of @xmath33 with @xmath34 as defined in @xcite and further explained in @xcite .",
    "the terms @xmath35 of ( 1@xmath36 ) are transformed into @xmath37 in the spm . using the jacobian @xmath38",
    ", one finds that @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this was already used by keil _",
    "@xcite who selected a distribution @xmath40 proportional to @xmath41 times a gaussian .",
    "these authors experimentally found that indeed @xmath42 is very near 1/4 in the case of silica .    for convenience , and for lack of different compelling indications ,",
    "we assume that the distribution can be factored into @xmath43 for @xmath44 , inspired by @xcite and @xcite , we use the normalized form @xmath45 since @xmath46 , this expression is integrable .",
    "the norm @xmath47 is selected so that @xmath44 integrates to 1 .",
    "this gives @xmath48 the function @xmath49 is the parabolic cylinder function @xcite .",
    "as explained in the following section , our independent analysis of a collection of data larger than that used in @xcite also leads to @xmath42 very close to 1/4 .",
    "this provides a solid support for this particular choice of @xmath44 .",
    "for @xmath50 we use a simple gaussian , rather similar to the gaussian cut - off of the linear asymmetry coefficient @xmath51 used by gil _",
    "indeed , @xmath52 , so that a gaussian in @xmath51 is very close to one in @xmath8 , the power of @xmath7 connecting the two variables being quite small . this functional form for @xmath50 was already employed succesfully by bonnet @xcite .",
    "it is written @xmath53 where @xmath54 is defined by the normalization condition that the integral of @xmath55 equals @xmath56 .",
    "the norm @xmath57 is then dimensionless and given by @xmath58 where we defined @xmath59 @xmath60 being the cut - off value of the asymmetry .",
    "we finally remark that with the above definitions , the integral density of defects is @xmath61    to complete the calculation , we now introduce ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) into ( 1 ) , and use ( 2 ) . in performing the integrals in ( 1 ) , we make the same approximation as in @xcite that sech(@xmath62 ) is replaced by 1 for @xmath63 and by zero otherwise .",
    "this eliminates the sech factors in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and simply replaces the limits of integration on @xmath8 by @xmath64 .",
    "it is convenient to define a dimensionless constant @xmath65 one obtains    @xmath66 @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the error function , @xmath69 for the purpose of comparison with literature results , it will be useful to relate the value of @xmath70 with the `` tunneling strength '' defined by @xmath71 in the usual tunneling model @xcite . given the distribution ( 4 ) , one can not strictly define @xmath21 , but this does not prevent defining @xmath72 in a consistent manner @xcite .",
    "we calculate this for @xmath73 .",
    "we use @xmath74 and @xmath75 from @xcite , where @xmath76 . introducing these definitions into @xmath77 , and using ( 8) , we find in the limit of small @xmath8 and @xmath7 , @xmath78 information on the numerical handling of eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and our choice of suitable fitting parameters are found in appendix a.",
    "it is generally agreed that sonic or ultrasonic damping at temperatures above @xmath79 k is dominated by thermally activated relaxation . to obtain the model parameters @xmath80 , @xmath60 , and @xmath81 entering eqs.@xmath82",
    ", it is necessary to analyze acoustic results over a sufficiently large range of frequencies @xmath4 , this up to high ultrasonic frequencies .",
    "it implies comparing data from various sources and generally acquired with different measurement techniques .",
    "tar leads to a peak in @xmath83 as observed by anderson and bmmel in ultrasonic pulse - echo measurements @xcite .",
    "these authors report precise data obtained on the ta - mode of vitreous silica at @xmath84 mhz .",
    "this is one of the curves that will be used for our analysis , as displayed in fig.@xmath85 .",
    "other high - frequency data were measured using the bragg diffraction of light , @xcite in a set - up similar to the original debye - sears experiment @xcite .",
    "damping results at @xmath86 mhz on both la- and ta - modes have been obtained in that manner @xcite . from these , and from results presented in @xcite , it is clear that la- and ta - modes lead to identical @xmath87 peak shapes .",
    "this implies that similar distributions of defects are active in the damping of all acoustic waves , independently from their polarizations .",
    "we use the data on the la - mode at 207 mhz from @xcite , also shown in fig.@xmath88 .",
    "the independence from polarization allows including in the evaluation sonic frequency results acquired on macroscopic vibrational modes , such as in vibrating reed measurements .",
    "we use the data at @xmath89 khz of classen , as reported in @xcite",
    ". this curve is also displayed in fig.@xmath88 .",
    "results at intermediate frequencies were collected using composite oscillators , at 660 khz on the la - mode in @xcite , and at 180 khz on a torsional mode in @xcite .",
    "as remarked in @xcite , this particular method can easily lead to instrumental background - loss contributions .",
    "this might have been the case in @xcite , as suggested from data on other glasses presented by the same authors in @xcite which show long absorption tails at high @xmath3 .",
    "this notion is also supported by fits that are explained below .",
    "hence , it is the 180 khz data from @xcite which is included in fig.@xmath85 . with these four curves ,",
    "the analysed data covers more than four decades in @xmath4 with a nearly linear progression in @xmath90 .",
    "-sio@xmath1 taken from the literature , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in order of decreasing frequency .",
    "the solid lines show our adjustment to eq.@xmath91 as explained below.,width=321 ]    the curves shown in fig.@xmath85 have been simultaneously adjusted to eq.@xmath91 , allowing for each measurement an independent coupling parameter @xmath92 . in the marquardt - levenberg routine",
    "used to this effect , the weights have been adjusted so that each curve had approximately the same weight , independently from the number of data points at each particular frequency .",
    "the excellent results of this fit , with @xmath42 fixed at 1/4 , are illustrated by the solid lines in fig.@xmath85 .",
    "the distribution parameters corresponding to these lines are @xmath93 k , @xmath94 with @xmath81 in seconds , and @xmath95 .",
    "if the same fit is repeated with @xmath42 free , one finds @xmath96 , and similar values for the other parameters : @xmath97 k , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "this shows that the distribution @xmath44 suggested by the spm is very adequate indeed .",
    "it also shows that @xmath42 can be fixed at 1/4 , which will be done for the rest of this paper .",
    "the rather high value obtained for @xmath100 emphasizes that one should not neglect the cut - off in the asymmetry distribution .",
    "we return to this point below .",
    "our analysis reveals a certain difficulty in comparing the absolute size of the various curves .",
    "this can be related to some extent to the different polarizations of the waves in these measurements , or also to a small part to the different qualities of the silica samples employed .",
    "however , it seems more likely that it arises to a large part from calibration inaccuracies in some of these measurements .",
    "indeed , discrepancies in the size of @xmath87 are directly observed in comparing literature reports , for example for the ta - waves at 20 mhz in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the difficulty is also seen in comparing the la to ta values of @xmath87 in @xcite and in @xcite . while in the former case it is the attenuations that have the same amplitudes for both la and ta , in the latter it is the internal frictions which are practically the same for both polarizations .",
    "this can not be reconciled as attenuation and friction differ by a factor proportional to the sound velocity , and the latter is @xmath101 m / s for la and @xmath102 m / s for ta - waves at low @xmath3 .",
    "we also observed that the results at 660 khz in @xcite are fitted extremely well with the same model parameters , provided one allows for a relatively small constant background contribution to @xmath87 , equal to @xmath103 .",
    "the values of @xmath92 obtained for these various measurements range then from @xmath104 in the case of @xcite to @xmath105 for @xcite .",
    "these variations in @xmath92 do not seem correlated to either the measuring frequency or the wave polarization , which is another reason to suspect calibration difficulties .",
    "-sio@xmath1 taken from the literature , @xcite for 660 khz and @xcite for 6.8 mhz .",
    "the solid lines show our calculation of the tar contribution according to eq.@xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "the data points of the upper two curves show the experiment minus the tar contribution.,width=321 ]    it is necessary to obtain a more reliable value of @xmath92 to analyze the brillouin scattering data in the following section . to this effect",
    "we remark that velocity measurements are generally both accurate and precise , allowing to follow small changes in @xmath108 with excellent accuracy .",
    "we use two measurements of the la - wave velocity , one at 660 khz from @xcite and the other at 6.8 mhz from @xcite .",
    "the experimental values @xmath109 are shown in fig.@xmath110 , together with continuous lines marked @xmath111 .",
    "these are calculated from the relaxation equation @xmath112 using the above values of @xmath80 , @xmath60 , and @xmath81 , together with @xmath107 . with the latter value , the dip around 50 k",
    "is completely accounted for .",
    "this is emphasized by the difference @xmath113 also shown in fig.@xmath114 .",
    "hence , we adopt for the following the coupling constant @xmath107 which happens to fall within the range of values obtained by fitting the various @xmath87 curves discussed above .",
    "we now return to the small cut - off value @xmath115  k which we obtained .",
    "this aspect has mostly been ignored by other workers .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that it is necessary to include a cut - off to obtain a good fit to the high-@xmath3 tails in fig",
    ".  1 . for example , forcing @xmath116 , the quality of the fits degrades appreciably above @xmath117  k , especially for the highest @xmath4 curve .",
    "more importantly , the calculated values of @xmath111 are then much too large to account properly for the dip around 60  k observed in fig .  2 .",
    "obviously , by the virtue of the kramers - kronig transform , @xmath111 integrates over a large part of the distribution , which is the reason for this problem .",
    "one might wish to gain an intuitive picture of why @xmath118 can be so much smaller than @xmath80 . to this effect , one can consider the models of tar drawn in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "we take as simplest examples model a , in which the two si atoms of a si@xmath119o@xmath119si bond are too close , and model b , in which they are too far apart . in either case , a double well potential for the connecting oxygen results with a barrier height @xmath7 that comes mainly from the separation of the two si .",
    "this barrier can thus be quite high .",
    "on the other hand , the asymmetry is produced by the difference in the wider environment of the two wells . in a hard glass",
    ", one might expect that these environments , which are dictated by the minimization of the energy , can be mostly quite similar . from these considerations ,",
    "one intuitively anticipates that the ratio @xmath120 might depend significantly on the particular glass .",
    "finally , we remark that the temperature @xmath121 of the peak positions in fig.@xmath85 depends linearly on ln@xmath122 .",
    "a similar observation was already made in @xcite .",
    "this typical arrhenius behavior supports tar as the principal relaxation mechanism to describe fig.@xmath85 , as opposed for example to incoherent tunneling that would lead to @xmath123 as seen from eq .",
    "( 2.95 ) of @xcite .",
    "high - resolution brillouin scattering measurements of the temperature dependence of the la - linewidth of vitreous silica have been reported in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the internal friction reported by tielbrger _",
    "et al_. in @xcite is also shown on the same figure .",
    "one notices the remarkable agreement between these two independent determinations .",
    "it emphasizes that brillouin scattering gives an absolute measurement of @xmath87 , independent from calibrations , since it suffices to take the ratio of the brillouin full - width to the brillouin shift to extract @xmath87 .",
    "this statement of course assumes that the spectroscopy can be performed with the required resolution , and in particular that the broadening produced by the finite collection aperture can be made sufficiently small .    also shown in fig.@xmath128",
    "is the curve @xmath83 calculated with eq.@xmath91 for @xmath129 ghz and with the parameters determined in section iii .",
    "it is evident that at brillouin frequencies tar can not account for the entire internal friction .",
    "the value @xmath130 is confirmed by the brillouin velocity results explained below .",
    "however , even if one would allow oneself to arbitrarily double the coupling constant @xmath92 , the line in fig.@xmath131 would still not superpose the data points .",
    "in particular the peak in @xmath83 occurs at a lower @xmath3-value than the peak in the observed @xmath87 .",
    "the difference between the two curves is attributed to its largest part to the anharmonic coupling of the la - waves with the thermally excited vibrational modes , as reported in ( i ) for densified silica glass .",

    "these slopes are shown by the dashed lines and they are discussed in appendix b.,width=321 ]    the relative changes reported in @xcite have also been converted back to velocities using @xmath138  m / s .",
    "subtracting from all three curves the @xmath139 calculated from eq.@xmath106 , one observes that below 150  k all the data collapse quite well .",
    "this confirms that the value of @xmath92 is also correct at brillouin frequencies .",
    "it also emphasizes that the @xmath4-dependence in the depth of the dip around 70  k is well predicted by tar .",
    "as explained in section vib , the velocity changes that are produced by the anharmonicity , @xmath140 , show little dispersion compared to the large dispersion in @xmath139 .",
    "hence , they do not modify the above conclusion .",
    "figure  5 shows the difference between the experimental internal friction and the calculated tar contribution .",
    "similarly to the results on @xmath0-sio@xmath1 in ( i ) , there is a region where the signal falls rapidly with decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "however , it does not seem to fall to zero sufficiently fast . in spite of the large scatter in the experimental values",
    ", there is a hint for an additional contribution to @xmath87 at low @xmath3 , in the region from @xmath141 to @xmath142 k.    .",

    "one observes that @xmath183 is proportional to @xmath184 over the main part of the data , from @xmath185  k to @xmath186  k. at higher @xmath3 , @xmath5 tapers off , while at lower @xmath3 there is a hint that @xmath183 might diverge faster than in @xmath184 .",
    "the solid line is a guide to the eye which is a sum of powers of @xmath3 .",
    "the same law is then used to trace the guide to the eye in fig.@xmath174 .    in fig.@xmath182",
    "we have traced for comparison the values of the relaxation time of the thermal modes for two other cases .",
    "firstly , we observe that @xmath183 obtained in ( i ) for densified silica glass , @xmath0-sio@xmath1 , is substantially shorter than in @xmath2-sio@xmath1",
    ". however , it shows a very similar functional dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , in order to deepen the understanding , we applied the same method of analysis to data on the la - mode of x - cut crystal quartz , @xmath177-sio@xmath1 .",
    "we used to this effect the attenuation coefficient measured by bmmel and dransfeld at 1  ghz @xcite . at temperatures above 150  k",
    ", we completed these data using the width of the brillouin line reported in @xcite .",
    "these data were analyzed similarly to fig.@xmath174 leading to @xmath187 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath183 is shown in fig.@xmath182 . in this case , the line through these points is _ not _ a guide to the eye as for the two glasses , but it is an independent determination of @xmath183 using the well - known kinetic expression for the thermal conductivity , @xmath188 we observe that in this case the value of @xmath5 derived from @xmath189 ( line ) is in remarkable agreement with that obtained from the measurement of anharmonic damping of the acoustic modes .",
    "this emphasizes the physical significance of @xmath5 : it really is the mean lifetime of the excitations in the thermal bath which at sufficiently high @xmath3 is entirelly controlled by umklapp ( u ) processes .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this produces a relaxation proportional to the phonon population , and thus at high @xmath3 one has @xmath190 . at intermediate @xmath3 , where @xmath191 and @xmath192 , eq .",
    "( 15 ) indicates that @xmath193 .",
    "this is indeed observed in @xmath177-sio@xmath1 over a large range of @xmath3 , as seen in fig.@xmath182 .",
    "equation  ( 15 ) assumes propagating thermal phonons . for this reason ,",
    "it becomes invalid in glasses at soon as @xmath3 increases beyond the thermal conductivity plateau located around 10  k in @xmath2-sio@xmath1 .",
    "however , we remark that the functional dependence @xmath194 observed in the two glasses is very similar in shape to that in @xmath177-sio@xmath1 .",
    "we have no simple explanation for this . in glasses , there are two competing effects that modify the picture presented above . on the one hand ,",
    "the strict quasi - momentum conservation which is invoqued in u - processes is strongly relaxed , and this must greatly enhance the interactions in the thermal bath , decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "this could account for the observed difference between crystal and glasses . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermal modes are not expected to be propagating plane - waves but they are at best diffusive .",
    "this restricts the spatial extent of the modes , greatly decreasing their overlap and thereby their interactions , which increases @xmath5 .",
    "we believe it is the latter effect which produces the much longer @xmath5 in @xmath2-sio@xmath1 compared to @xmath0-sio@xmath1 .",
    "indeed , in @xmath0-sio@xmath1 the boson peak is strongly reduced @xcite .",
    "this increases the crossover frequency @xmath195 beyond which the acoustic excitations become diffusive , as recently confirmed by inelastic x - ray scattering @xcite .",
    "this in turn increases the mean spatial extent of the modes and thereby their interactions leading to a faster thermalization .",
    "finally , we remark that the above analysis gives values for the mean grneisen parameter @xmath172 .",
    "we find 0.95 for the la - mode of x - cut quartz , 3.6 for @xmath2-sio@xmath1 , and 8 for @xmath0-sio@xmath1 . in the case of crystal quartz",
    ", the agreement between the line calculated from the thermal conductivity @xmath189 and that obtained from @xmath87 gives a solid support for the value of @xmath172 .",
    "unfortunately , one can not make a similar comparison for the glasses .",
    "figure  7 summarizes the present analysis of the internal friction observed in @xmath2-sio@xmath1 with brillouin scattering around 35 ghz .",
    "one identifies two main contributions : @xmath83 arising from thermally activated relaxation and @xmath196 which results from network viscosity . around room @xmath3 , @xmath165 is nearly twice as large as @xmath83 .",
    "the incoherent tunneling contribution @xmath143 , if it really exists at these high frequency and temperatures , mainly produces the small hump around 40 k. although there is a hint for such a feature in the data shown in fig .  7",
    ", it would need to be confirmed by more precise measurements . also , we neglected in this analysis a possible contribution arising from the quasi - harmonic oscillators of the soft - potential model @xcite .",
    "this is explained in appendix d.    ) and @xcite ( + ) .",
    "the solid curve is the entire adjustment made here which is the sum of three contributions @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199.,width=321 ]    as @xmath4 is increased beyond 35 ghz , we find that the value @xmath83 calculated with eq .",
    "( 9a ) saturates .",
    "this saturation essentially results from the cut - off in @xmath50 .",
    "for example at room @xmath3 , @xmath83 does not increase beyond @xmath2001.5@xmath20110@xmath202 . on the other hand , at sufficiently high @xmath3 , @xmath165 continues to grow with @xmath150 according to @xmath203 which applies as long as @xmath204 .",
    "we also find that @xmath205 is practically constant from 100 to 300  k. for these reasons , the total @xmath87 becomes dominated by network viscosity , it continues to increase proportionally to @xmath150 up to several hundred ghz , and it is nearly @xmath3-independent from 100  k to 300  k. this is in excellent agreement with the results on acoustic propagation reported for @xmath2-sio@xmath1 thin films by zhu , maris , and tauc @xcite .",
    "these authors find that the mean free path , @xmath206 , grows in @xmath207 from @xmath20030 ghz to @xmath200300 ghz , and that it is nearly independent of @xmath3 from 80 to 300  k. since @xmath208 , the dominance of @xmath165 , its growth @xmath209 , and its near constancy in @xmath3 , fully account for the data reported in @xcite .",
    "our predictions are also fully consistent with three data points measured with uv brillouin scattering from @xmath20050 to @xmath200100 ghz @xcite .    on the other hand , at ultrasonic frequencies , _",
    "i.e. _ much below 35 ghz , the contribution of @xmath165 which decreases proportionally to @xmath150 becomes completely negligible compared to @xmath83 .",
    "this justifies the analysis based only on tar that was performed in relation with fig .  1 .",
    "after correction for tar and network viscosity ( upper data points ) .",
    "the line is a fit of @xmath6 to wachtman s equation as a guide to the eye .",
    "the @xmath6 data for @xmath0-sio@xmath1 from ( i ) are also shown for comparison.,width=321 ]    figure@xmath210 shows the velocity changes calculated from eq.@xmath106 for tar , and using @xmath211 for the network viscosity , this at two typical frequencies .",
    "one notices that the increase in @xmath4 from 6.8  mhz to 35  ghz leads to a large reduction of @xmath212 . on the other hand , @xmath213 , although quite large above 100  k , changes relatively little with @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the dashed curve is entirely in the regime @xmath204 , so that it is practically independent of @xmath150 at lower @xmath150-values .",
    "this justifies the approach used to determine @xmath214 in fig .  2 where the anharmonicity contribution was simply neglected .",
    "at sufficiently high-@xmath3 , anharmonicity always leads to a quasi - linear decrease of @xmath2 with @xmath3 , very similar to what is observed in crystals @xcite .",
    "this has been seen in ultrasonic measurements in a large number of glasses , _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite where this effect is interpreted as such . at these frequencies ,",
    "one is in a regime where the velocity changes are dominated by network viscosity while the damping mainly originates from tar .",
    "it is generally necessary to go up to brillouin frequencies to observe in @xmath87 both contributions simultaneously .",
    "the velocity changes in tetrahedrally coordinated glasses , in particular in @xmath2-sio@xmath1 and in @xmath0-sio@xmath1 , are more complex than described above .",
    "fig.@xmath215 shows the observed velocities , @xmath2 , and the unrelaxed value that is corrected for both tar and network - viscosity dispersions , @xmath216 $ ] . as observed , the experimental points collapse to a @xmath217 which on this scale is essentially @xmath150-independent .",
    "however , rather than being constant , @xmath217 increases considerably with @xmath3 . in the same figure , the results obtained in ( i ) for @xmath0-sio@xmath1 are shown for comparison .",
    "both solid lines are guides to the eye obtained by an _",
    "ad hoc _ adjustment to wachtman s equation @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath217 is remarkably similar in both glasses , pointing to an anomalous hardening of silica with increasing @xmath3 . as discussed in ( i ) , the earlier proposal that this is a manifestation of large structural inhomogeneities @xcite is not supported by observations .",
    "the anomalous hardening has recently been attributed to a progressive local polyamorphic transition associated with abrupt rotations of randomly distributed si - o - si bonds , found in simulations @xcite .",
    "thermal agitation would redistribute the si - o - si bond angles in configurations where they are more resilient .",
    "however , contrary to @xcite , our results indicate that a very similar mechanism would then be active in permanently densified silica . repeating the warning made in ( i ) , although @xmath217 has a clear physical significance , it would be nearly impossible to perform at the moment an experiment to directly measure it .",
    "this is even more so in @xmath2-sio@xmath1 than in @xmath0-sio@xmath1 , owing to the lower @xmath218 of the former glass .",
    "it remains to compare the value @xmath107 found in section iii to the tunneling - strength parameter @xmath219 from the literature . to do this ,",
    "both values are inserted in eq .  ( 11 ) to calculate the cut - off energy @xmath220 that applies to the present case .",
    "we find @xmath221  k , as opposed to the tls value @xmath222  k derived from the low-@xmath3 specific heat data @xcite .",
    "such a larger value of @xmath220 was already reported , resulting from a similar analysis in @xcite .",
    "its origin was convincingly explained there as arising from a different weighing of the distribution of @xmath220-values , in @xmath223 for the specific heat , and in @xmath224 for the ultrasonic absorption .",
    "the value of @xmath92 is thus fully in line with expectations .",
    "we have shown that ultrasonic and hypersonic damping and dispersion in vitreous silica at temperatures above the quantum regime originate in at least two main processes : thermally activated relaxation and network viscosity .",
    "these have different @xmath150 and @xmath3 dependences which leads to a non - trivial variation of the scattering linewidth @xmath225 with @xmath150 . at a given @xmath3 , tar dominates the damping at low @xmath150 , while anharmonicity dominates at sufficiently high @xmath150 . between these two regimes there occurs a `` dynamical crossover '' which for @xmath2-sio@xmath1 at room @xmath3 falls near our brillouin frequency , as shown in fig .",
    "10 of @xcite and confirmed in fig .  7 above .",
    "above this crossover , the damping is dominated by @xmath203 , which implies that @xmath226 . as @xmath150 is increased far beyond optical brillouin frequencies ,",
    "another broadening mechanism eventually comes into play . around 300  ghz",
    ", one expects the onset of a new contribution to @xmath87 , growing with a higher power of @xmath150 , possibly in @xmath227 , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "this additional contribution is currently thought to result from the hybridization of the acoustic modes with boson - peak excitations @xcite , as inelastic x - ray scattering observations on @xmath0-sio@xmath1 strongly suggest @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , inelastic x - ray scattering at sufficiently small scattering vectors and with sufficiently high energy resolution could not yet be performed on @xmath2-sio@xmath1 to settle the issue of this onset .",
    "this hybridization eventually leads to the ioffe - regel crossover at @xmath195 , above which the excitations have lost their plane - wave character .",
    "then , the wave - vector @xmath228 does not remain a good label for the modes which are at best diffusive @xcite .",
    "the excitations of the thermal bath are expected to be of that nature in glasses , as discussed in section v.    power laws @xmath229 , or @xmath230 which is equivalent as long as the frequency is well below the ioffe - regel limit so that @xmath231 , are often employed to represent the damping data @xmath232 . as just explained , @xmath226 is a reasonable approximation in the region between the dynamical crossover and the ioffe - regel one . on the opposite",
    ", such laws should be viewed as quite rough approximations in the tar - dominated regime .",
    "the reason is that the dependence of @xmath225 on @xmath150 predicted by eq .",
    "9a is more complicated .",
    "it can not be written simply in terms of a @xmath3-dependent exponent @xmath137 .",
    "for example , in @xmath2-sio@xmath1 at room @xmath3 , a value @xmath233 is given in @xcite , while @xmath234 is derived from @xcite . we conclude that power laws in the tar - dominated regime are _ ad hoc _ devices which only represent approximately the data , especially if the latter are sufficiently noisy to mask the disagreements .    at this point",
    ", it is legitimate to ask to what extent anharmonicity might be important to sound damping in other glasses .",
    "the answer to this question depends on two factors : i ) the strength , density , and distribution of the relaxing defects ; ii ) the strength of the anharmonicity .",
    "it is conceivable that in glasses that contain a large quantity of defects up to high values of @xmath80 and @xmath118 , tar would mask the anharmonicity . in that case",
    "the dynamical crossover might move up to nearly @xmath218 , so that a regime @xmath226 might not be observable at all .",
    "we have found such a case in lithium diborate , @xmath2-li@xmath1b@xmath235o@xmath236 @xcite .",
    "this type of situation is expected for most polymers in which the tunneling strength @xmath72 is quite large @xcite . on the other hand , there exist many glasses or amorphous materials for which @xmath72 is quite small , well below @xmath237 @xcite .",
    "such are the amorphous group iv semiconductors , c , si , and ge . in that case",
    ", the anharmonicity is expected to dominate over a considerable range of @xmath150 and a calculation to that effect has already been performed @xcite . of the tetrahedrally coordinated glasses , it will be particularly interesting to reinvestigate @xmath2-geo@xmath1 and @xmath2-bef@xmath1 .",
    "difficulties met in obtaining a quantitative description of damping and dispersion in germania on the basis of tar alone , described in @xcite , might find their resolution by including in the analysis the cut - off @xmath118 and the network - viscosity contribution .    to summarize , tar essentially explains acoustic damping results in silica glass up to a few ghz . at higher frequencies , the anharmonic coupling of hypersound to the modes that form",
    "the entire thermal bath becomes progressively dominant .",
    "this conclusion , in line with previous observations @xcite and simulations @xcite , corrects statements to the contrary often found in the literature , _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite .",
    "the anharmonicity which in our view produces @xmath199 is a coupling of sound to the whole bath , in addition to the relatively small fraction of modes forming the boson peak .",
    "this process , which we call network viscosity , is in a way quite similar to the usual lattice viscosity of crystals .",
    "for the marquardt - levenberg adjustment of eqs .",
    "( 9 ) , it is convenient to use the parameters @xmath92 , @xmath80 , log@xmath238 , @xmath42 , and @xmath239 .",
    "taking as integration variable @xmath240 , and defining the auxiliary variables @xmath241 and @xmath242 , eq.@xmath91 becomes    @xmath243    good results are obtained with a simple trapezoidal integration , taking a geometric progression for the vector of @xmath28-values .",
    "we used @xmath28 starting at @xmath244 and ending at @xmath245 , in steps of 1% .",
    "eq.@xmath106 is handled similarly .",
    "one observes on the upper curves of fig .",
    "4 that there is a small difference in the high temperature slopes for the two different frequencies .",
    "the origin of this effect might be in the velocity dispersion associated , by the kramers - kronig transform , with the relatively small damping @xmath198 produced by incoherent tunneling . at high @xmath3 , the damping is given by the third equation ( 2.94 ) of @xcite , @xmath246 the corresponding @xmath247 is derived from the third equation ( 2.96 ) of @xcite , which gives for the @xmath150-dependent part @xmath248 the temperature @xmath152 marks the end of the low-@xmath3 plateau region in @xmath87 and it is given by eqs .",
    "( 2.78 ) and ( 2.79 ) of @xcite .",
    "owing to the logarithmic dependence in ( b2 ) , it is the difference of slopes at two frequencies which is significant ,    @xmath249    with the values in fig .  4 , and calculating @xmath152 following @xcite , one finds @xmath250 . as expected , this is smaller than the tunneling strength found from specific heat measurements at low temperatures @xcite , the reduction being of the order of @xmath251 .",
    "hence , it is not unreasonable to assign the difference in slopes observed at high-@xmath3 in fig .",
    "4 to the kramers - kronig transform of @xmath198 .",
    "it is in principle trivial to solve the quadratic equation @xmath252 for @xmath253 in terms of the measured @xmath254 .",
    "however , imaginary roots do occur in the region around @xmath255 owing to fluctuations in the data leading to some points for which @xmath256 .",
    "these are the points whose ordinate lies above the maximum of the solid curve drawn in fig.@xmath174 . for these data points",
    ", we simply replaced @xmath28 by 1 , as the nearest real solution .",

    ", one must select between the upper and the lower root of the quadratic equation .",
    "this is set by the location of the maximum in the solid curve , @xmath259 . for @xmath260 ,",
    "the upper root applies since @xmath261 , while the lower root applies at higher temperatures .",
    "we have not considered the damping arising from the weak anharmonicity of the nearly harmonic oscillators ( ho ) of the soft potential model in the domain @xmath262 @xcite .",
    "this contribution should be most active at `` intermediate '' frequencies . in @xmath2-sio@xmath1 ,",
    "its strength has actually been predicted to be largest near our brillouin frequency @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that the entire @xmath263-domain covered by the propagating pulse measurements of @xcite falls within this `` intermediate '' frequency range where the additional damping obeys @xmath264 @xcite . if the strength of @xmath265 would be sufficient",
    ", one should definitely notice its effect on the @xmath263-dependence of the mean free path reported in @xcite from 80 to 300  k and from 30 to 300  ghz .",
    "on the contrary , the mean free path is found practically @xmath3-independent and it increases @xmath266 , in agreement with the network - viscosity contribution .",
    "it seems thus justified to neglect @xmath265 in our analysis of the brillouin results up to 300  k. the difficulty in estimating the size of @xmath265 apparently lies in finding the proper value for the tunneling - strength parameter @xmath72 that applies to it .",
    "the value @xmath267 3.0@xmath20110@xmath268 , appropriate for tls at very low temperatures @xcite , is certainly too large here . indeed , using this value in eq .",
