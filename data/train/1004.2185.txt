    "the most striking disagreement is the deviation of the theoretical magnetic susceptibility @xmath12 even at rather high temperatures ( @xmath13).@xcite    this disagreement originates from the choice of the akm which was based on geometry only , while the structural peculiarities of volborthite were not considered .",
