    "we highlight this modularity with a diagram of boxes ( similar to  @xcite ) : oval boxes enclose nodes of type @xmath9 , that are not connected among themselves , while rectangular boxes enclose @xmath16-cliques of @xmath10-nodes  @xcite .",

    "for example , the following scheme yields a _",
    "two_-threshold net , equivalent to three - letter sequence nets generated by the rule .",
    "let the nodes be assigned weights @xmath163 , from a random distribution , and connect any two nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 that satisfy @xmath164 or @xmath165 . identifying nodes with weight @xmath166 with @xmath9 , nodes with @xmath167 with @xmath10 , and nodes with @xmath168 with @xmath146 , we see that all @xmath9 s connect to one another and all @xmath146 s connect to one another but the @xmath10 s do not , and @xmath9 s and @xmath146 s do not connect ; nodes of type @xmath9 and @xmath10 may or may not connect , and likewise for nodes of type @xmath146 and @xmath10 . to reflect the actual connections , the nodes of type @xmath9 and @xmath10 may be arranged in a sequence according to the algorithm in  @xcite , for the threshold rule .",
    "also the nodes of type @xmath146 and @xmath10 may be arranged in a sequence , to reflect the actual connections , with the very same algorithm . because there are no connections between @xmath9 and @xmath146 the two results may be trivially merged .",
    "note , however , that once the @xmath9-@xmath10 sequence is established the order of the @xmath10 s is set , so the direction of connections between @xmath146 and @xmath10 ( @xmath169 or @xmath170 ) is _ not _ arbitrary . in our example , the mapping is possible to but not to .",
    "we have introduced a new class of nets , sequence nets , obtained from a sequence of letters and fixed rules of connectivity .",
    "two - letter sequence nets contain threshold nets , and in addition two newly discovered classes .",
    "the class can be mapped to a  difference - threshold \" net , where nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 are connected if their weights difference satisfies @xmath143 . this type of net may be a particularly good model for social nets , where the weights might measure political leaning , economical status , number of offspring , etc . , and",
    "agents tend to associate when they are closer in these measures .",
    "we have shown that the structural properties of the new classes of two - letter sequence nets can be analyzed with ease , and we have introduced an ordering in ensembles of sequence nets that is useful in visualizing and studying their various attributes .",
    "we have fully classified 3-letter sequence nets , and looked at a few examples , showing that they too can be analyzed simply .",
    "the diameter of sequence nets grows linearly with the number of letters in the alphabet and for a 3-letter alphabet it is already 3 or 4 , comparable to many everyday life complex nets .",
    "realistic diameters might be achieved with a modest expansion of the alphabet .",
    "there remain numerous open questions : applying symmetry arguments we have managed to reduce the class of 3-leter nets to just 30 types , but we have not ruled out the possibility that some overlooked symmetry might reduce the list further ; the question of which sequences lead to connected nets can be studied by inspection for small alphabets , but we have no comprehensive approach to solve the problem in general ; we have shown how to map sequence nets to generalized types of threshold nets , in some cases  is such a mapping always possible ?",
    "is there a systematic way to find such mappings for any sequence rule ? ; what kinds of nets would result if the connectivity rules applied only to the @xmath50 preceding letters , instead of to _ all _ preceding letters ? etc .",
    "we hope to tackle some of these questions in future work ."
