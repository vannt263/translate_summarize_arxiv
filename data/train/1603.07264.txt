    "we assume the magnetic field as an external and weak in such a sence that it can not modify the metric of the background spacetime or , more precisely , the violation of the spacetime geometry by the magnetic field is negligibly small .",

    "for instance , in the magnetic coupling processes studied in @xcite , based on the use of the fundamental variability plane , the estimations of the magnitude of the magnetic field in the black hole vicinity give the values & & b10 ^ 8 m10 m _",

    ". however , the effect of magnetic field which is weak in comparison to the gravitational mass effect ( [ bbb ] ) in the case of the spacetime curvature , can be quite large for the motion of charged test particles .",
    "the relative influence of the magnetic field induced by the lorentz force @xmath17 is governed by the specific charge of the particle ( ratio of the electric charge and mass of the particle ) and is of the order of b ~4.7 10 ^ 7 ( ) ( ) ^-1 ( ) ( ) , [ lorb ] where @xmath18 is the proton mass .",

    "however the situation changes dramatically when the black hole spin @xmath6 is getting close to the extremal value of @xmath113 and the differences of these two cases are profound  see fig.[veloc - grad ] .      in the field of non - magnetized ( @xmath114 ) kerr black holes , the velocity @xmath115 of corotating circular geodesics related to the lnrf ( called lnrf velocity ) has a monotonous radial profile , if the black hole spin is not too close to the extremal value of @xmath113  it increases with decreasing radius , i.e. , @xmath116 for all the circular geodesics .",
    "however , when the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole approaches the extremal value , namely when @xmath117 , a non - monotonic behaviour has been found in the lnrf velocity profiles of the particles on corotating circular geodesics in the region close to the horizon ( see , fig.[veloc - grad ] for @xmath118 ) @xcite .",
