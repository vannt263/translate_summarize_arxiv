    "a brain tissue is composed of many neurons which function and interact with each other by generating a time sequence of characteristic electrical pulses known as action potentials or spikes @xcite .",
    "these time sequences of spikes generated by a set of neurons is referred to as multi - neuronal spike train data .",
    "such data contain the stochastic firing ( or spike generating ) events of individual neurons as well as spiking activity due to coordinated functioning of a group of neurons which are functionally interconnected . analyzing the multi - neuronal data to identify the spatio - temporal network structure of the functional connectivity of the neurons underlying",
    "a specific brain activity is one of the biggest challenges in neuroscience .",
    "multi - electrode array ( mea ) recordings have become a standard neuroscience tool in recent years , leading to large collections of multi - neuronal data , with each collection involving spikes from many neurons ( see figure 7 for an example of mea data ) .",
    "it is critical that we are able to analyze data from these multi - channel studies in order to understand how groups of neurons in a given region of the brain act together in response to external stimuli or internal mental processes .",
    "however , there is limited ability currently to process such large amounts of spatial and temporal data quickly and efficiently and analyze them to make the appropriate inference @xcite .",
    "many of the common techniques , such as cross - correlograms , cross - intensity functions , and joint peri - stimulus time histograms , are aimed at analyzing neurons pairwise or at most a small number of neurons at a time @xcite .",
    "frequent episode discovery @xcite , a popular framework for temporal data mining , has recently been proposed as a method for characterizing temporal firing patterns from multi - neuronal spike train data @xcite .",
    "temporal data mining deals with the analysis of time - stamped symbolic ( categorical ) data streams , specifically a sequence of time stamped events of a given type . in the analysis of multi - neuronal data , the events are spikes , and the event type would be the neuron that generated the spike .",
    "we are interested in _ serial episodes _ given by an ordered collection of event types , namely certain events occurring in the prescribed order ( such as a firing of neuron @xmath0 followed by firing of neuron @xmath1 ) .",
    "these episodes can also be specified with temporal constraints , for example , specific time delays between the firings of the two neurons .",
    "patnaik , sastry and unnikrishnan ( 2008 ) have used temporal data mining methods to compute the frequent episodes of interest : repeated occurrences of a precisely timed pattern of spiking activity across a collection of neurons .",
    "a review of the approach is given in section 2 .",
    "a major challenge in implementing the algorithms in practice is that it is computationally expensive to compute the complete set of frequent episodes of all order .",
    "we need statistically - defined thresholds that allow us to delineate the unimportant ones ( random or weak connectivity ) from the significant ones , so that only counts above pre - specified thresholds need to be counted .",
    "section 3 of the paper develops the statistical distribution of the number of frequent episodes as well as that of the number of ` non - overlapping ' episodes ( defined in section 2 ) .",
    "this is an important result that allows practical implementation of the temporal data mining algorithm .",
    "earlier work @xcite used recurrence relations to compute the mean and variance of these quantities .",
    "the results here provide a complete characterization of the distribution which allows us to compute all moments of the distribution as well as obtain good approximations to the quantiles .",
    "section 4 discusses how the results can be used for statistical inference about the connectivity strength of the neurons ( the strength of the edges of the network ) .",
    "section 5 shows an application of the results to simulated multi - neuronal data , while section 6 demonstrates the usefulness of the results on a real neuronal data set .",
    "the method presented here employs fixed time delays between neurons in the firing patterns and considers only serial patterns .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion of how the method can be extended in section 7 .",
    "the notion that information may be encoded in the precise timing of neuronal spikes , rather than only in firing rates , was suggested by hebb when he introduced the concept of neuronal assemblies @xcite .",
    "when activated , these `` hebb cell - assemblies '' would produce a characteristic spatio - temporal pattern of spikes .",
    "discovering frequent episodes is thus akin to finding pieces of a neuronal assembly which are functionally connected .",
    "subsequent analysis of the set of frequent episodes discovered can lead to a reconstruction of the assembly as a graph of its functional connections .",
    "the most popular method for detecting repeated occurrences of precise patterns of spikes is the two - tape algorithm of abeles and gerstein ( 1988 ) , which is based on correlations between time - shifted spike trains of two neurons .",
    "as mentioned earlier , most currently available statistical techniques can handle computations involving only a small number of neurons ( e.g. 5 ) .",
    "however , spatio - temporal groups or `` polychronous circuits '' involving as many as 25 neurons have been suggested based on modeling studies @xcite@xcite . the ability to simultaneously record data from an increasing number neurons necessitates the development of algorithms for inferring firing patterns involving large number of neurons .",
    "the data - mining method proposed in patnaik et al ( 2008 ) is an efficient technique for computing patterns involving many neurons . in this section ,",
    "we provide a brief overview of the frequent episodes framework @xcite@xcite and the data - mining algorithm of patnaik et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "the data to be analyzed are viewed as a time - ordered sequence of events denoted by @xmath2 . here",
    ", @xmath3 denotes the event type ( which takes values from a finite set ) and @xmath4 denotes the time of occurrence .",
    "the data is ordered so that @xmath5 , @xmath6 . for the spike train data",
    ", the event type of each spike event would be the identity of the neuron that generated that spike .",
    "thus , by collecting together all spikes from all neurons and ordering them in time , we get the data as an event stream .",
    "the temporal patterns of interest in this framework are called _ episodes _ , which are , in general , partially ordered sets of some of the event types . in this paper , we consider only the so - called _ serial episodes _ , or ( short ) ordered , sequences of event types . for example , a serial episode @xmath7 means the ordered event _ a followed by b followed by c_. a serial episode is said to occur in a data stream if there is a large enough number of events of the appropriate types in the data that conform to the order imposed by the episode .",
    "for example , consider the following data sequence :    [ ( a,1 ) , ( d,3 ) , ( c,4 ) , ( a,5 ) , ( b,7 ) , ( b,8 ) , ( c , 11 ) , ( c,12 ) , ( f,12 ) , ( a,13 ) , ( b,15 ) , ( c,17 ) ] +    this means means neuron @xmath0 fired at time unit 1 , neuron @xmath8 fired at time unit 3 , and so on .",
    "if we consider the subset of events @xmath9 , there is an occurrence of @xmath10 .",
    "there are three distinct occurrences of this episode in the above data set . a serial episode such as @xmath10 , when it occurs often in the spike data",
    ", would be an interesting microcircuit .",
    "this is because it represents a specific time ordered sequence of firing by the three neurons and such microcircuits may play a role in information processing in the brain .    given a large set of multi - neuronal data , the computational task is to automatically discover all _ frequent _ episodes .",
    "it is not tractable to compute all distinct frequent episodes in a large data set , so we will focus on non - overlapping episodes .",
    "two occurrences of an episode are said to be non - overlapping if their corresponding time periods do not overlap .",
    "for example , in the data sequence given above , the first occurrence of @xmath10 overlaps with the second one .",
    "( see figure 1 for another illustration ) .",
    "a set of occurrences of an episode is said to be non - overlapping if every pair is non - overlapping .",
    "-b$ ] , however at most 2 of the occurrences are nonoverlapping ]    laxman et al ( 2005 , 2007 ) developed efficient algorithms for counting all non - overlapped occurrences of episodes .",
    "these algorithms use the apriori - style level - wise procedure that is common to many frequent pattern discovery methods in data mining @xcite . at each level ,",
    "say , @xmath11 , we use frequent episodes of size @xmath12 to generate candidate @xmath11-node episodes and , through one pass over the data , count the frequencies of all candidate episodes .",
    "those counts over the threshold are considered frequent @xmath11-node episodes .",
    "we use finite - state automata based counting procedures for obtaining the frequencies of all candidate episodes .",
    "these methods are efficient when we are counting only non - overlapped occurrences @xcite .",
    "apart from considerations of computational efficiency , the count of non - overlapped occurrences as frequency is somewhat natural in our application of spike train data analysis .",
    "if a serial episode is to be interesting as ( part of ) a microcircuit in the underlying neural tissue , then we would like it to represent a chain of causative or triggerring events .",
    "a frequent episode ( based on count of nonoverlapping occurrences ) would be such a chain that occurs repeatedly at different times .",
    "however , for frequent serial episodes to be interesting in the context of microcircuits in the neural tissue , we need additional temporal structure in the episodes .",
    "suppose neuron @xmath0 strongly influences neuron @xmath1 which in turn influences @xmath13 .",
    "hence we can expect @xmath10 to be a frequent episode .",
    "however all such influences among neurons are mediated by processes that have characteristic time delays on the order of milliseconds . to motivate why it is important to consider time delays when characterizing influence among neurons we will give a brief explanation of the physiology of neuronal communication .",
    "a neuron consists of a cell body , from which extends a long , thin structure called an axon .",
    "axons form connections with other neurons at junctions called synapses .",
    "when a neuron fires a spike , the electrical impulse travels down the axon to the synapse , where chemicals ( neurotransmitters ) are released which diffuse across the synapse and may or may not cause the neuron on the other side of the synapse to fire a spike in response .",
    "the randomness of the diffusion process gives some insight into why conditional probabilities are a good way to measure the strength of a neuronal connection .",
    "furthermore , the diffusion process takes some time , referred to as the synaptic delay .",
    "axons can be rather lengthy , and so of !",
    "ten there is also a delay associated with propagation of the action potential down the axon .",
    "thus , if a spike from @xmath1 is viewed as being due to the influence of @xmath0 , then we should have the difference between the times of the two spikes to be in some interval @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "so , for a frequent episode to represent influences among underlying neurons , we should ensure that we count only those occurrences of the episode which satisfy this additional temporal constraint .",
    "hence , we consider serial episodes with inter - event time constraints .",
    "we represent such an episode as @xmath15- b[k_2]-c$ ] . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the inter - event times that are required .",
    "for this episode to occur , we need spikes from @xmath18 and @xmath13 in that order and , in addition , the time between @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be @xmath16 and the time between @xmath1 and @xmath13 should be @xmath17 . in multi - neuronal spike data ,",
    "such serial episodes with inter - event time constraints denote sequential firing by a group of neurons with fixed delays between different neurons .",
    "such patterns , sometimes called precise firing sequences , are important microcircuits , and automatically detecting such sequences from spike data is very useful for understanding the functional connectivity in the neural tissue .    in general , time delays between neurons are not strictly constant .",
    "this can be taken care of by specifying the inter - event time constraint as an interval rather than a single number .",
    "however , in this paper , we will assume that the delays are constant and when we specify a delay the units are milliseconds .",
    "the frequent episode discovery algorithms mentioned earlier have been generalized to the case of serial episodes with inter - event time constraints @xcite .",
    "this algorithm can handle inter - event constraints specified as intervals also .",
    "in addition , if the user specifies a set of intervals ( as all possible inter - event constraints ) , then the algorithm can discover frequent episodes along with the most appropriate inter - event time constraints .",
    "this is the algorithm that we use in this paper in all our empirical results .",
    "for practical implementation of the algorithm discussed above , we need to set a threshold above which we deem episode counts to be frequent .",
    "the rationale is that many of the counts are due to random firings of the neurons , and we want to focus only on counts that indicate true dependence .",
    "( we will restrict attention here to positive dependence as the case of negative dependence or inhibition is more difficult . )",
    "additionally , using appropriate thresholds to determine frequent episodes of size @xmath19 allows us to gain computational efficiency by limiting the number of candidate patterns generated of size @xmath11 .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to compute thresholds under the assumption that the neurons fire independently of each other .",
    "it is more interesting ( and useful ) to compute thresholds under appropriate notions of _ weak connectivity _ , and look at counts larger than these thresholds , indicating moderate to strong connectivity .",
    "we will do this under the notion of strength based on conditional probabilities introduced in sastry and unnikrishnan ( 2008 ) .",
    "we will discretize time into bins of a fixed size @xmath20 . from now on ,",
    "when we say time @xmath21 , it refers to the right end - point of the bin , so that time @xmath21 refers to the bin @xmath22 $ ] for @xmath23 for simplicity , we will assume that the time delays between the neurons are fixed , and denote this delay by @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the conditional probability that @xmath1 fires at time @xmath26 given that @xmath0 fired at @xmath21 .",
    "( we assume stationarity so that this conditional probability is same for all @xmath21 ) . under independence , @xmath27 .",
    "define @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a user - defined threshold .",
    "we say that the influences of @xmath0 on @xmath1 is ` weak ' if @xmath30 .",
    "now , we need to know the distribution of the number of frequent episodes under the various degrees of strength so that we can develop thresholds , or more formally statistical hypothesis tests that can be used to detect the important episodes .",
    "we start with the simpler case of the total number of occurrences of an episode ( including overlapped occurrences ) .",
    "suppose we observe the number of firings over a time period with @xmath31 bins , each of size @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath32 be the probability that neuron @xmath0 fires in an interval .",
    "define @xmath33 similarly .",
    "suppose we are interested in the event @xmath34-b$ ] , i.e. , @xmath1 fires @xmath24 time units after @xmath0 fires .",
    "let @xmath35 if @xmath36 occurs at time @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath0 fires at time @xmath21 and @xmath1 fires at time @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the probability of this event at any time @xmath21 .",
    "then , @xmath38 , where @xmath39-b|a)$ ] .",
    "in other words , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the strength of the connection .    define @xmath42 as the total number of ( possibly overlapping ) events of type @xmath36 during the observation period .",
    "note that the possible values of @xmath42 range from @xmath43 to @xmath44 ; any firing of @xmath0 that occurs after time @xmath45 will not complete by time @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , under our model , the @xmath46 s are independent and identically distributed bernoulli random variables with success probability @xmath37 .",
    "hence @xmath42 has a binomial distribution with parameters @xmath44 and @xmath37 .",
    "in particular ,    @xmath47    and the variance is @xmath48      however , we are more interested in the distribution of the number of non - overlapping occurrences of type @xmath36 , which we denote @xmath49 .",
    "we obtain the distribution of @xmath49 in this section .",
    "let @xmath50 be independent and identically distributed binomial random variables with parameters @xmath24 as the number of trials , and @xmath37 as the success probability .",
    "further , the @xmath51 s are independent of @xmath49 .    _",
    "proposition : @xmath42 has the same distribution as _",
    "_ sketch of proof : _ recall that @xmath42 is the total number of events of type @xmath36 and that @xmath49 is the number of non - overlapping occurrences .",
    "there are @xmath24 time units ( bins ) between each of the @xmath49 non - overlapping occurrences .",

    "while equation 3 gives us a complete characterization of the distribution of @xmath49 , it can not be used to compute the actual probability mass function or the cumulative distribution function .",
    "however , we can obtain the moment generating function ( mgf ) of @xmath49 which can be used to get all the moments .",

    "let @xmath58 note that this is a one - to - one and strictly increasing function of @xmath21 , so a unique inverse exists .",
    "denote this inverse function by @xmath59 .",
    "the function @xmath59 has to be solved numerically .",
    "then , the mgf of @xmath49 can be expressed as @xmath60=e[\\exp(g(s)n)]=(q_e+p_e\\exp(g(s))^{l - k+1}.\\ ] ]    we can get the @xmath24th moment of the distribution of @xmath49 by differentiating the mgf @xmath24 times w.r.t . to @xmath41 and evaluating it at @xmath61 .",
    "the information about moments can be used to numerically compute the probability mass function or cumulative distribution function of @xmath49 to a good degree of approximation .    in this section , we will focus on the adequacy of a normal approximation of @xmath49 .",
    "table 1 shows the skewness and kurtosis of @xmath49 calculated for a particular choice of @xmath31 and @xmath24 and a range of @xmath37 values .",
    "we have subtracted 3 from the kurtosis for easy comparison with the normal distribution .",
    "note that these values are all quite close to zero ( except for the skewness for @xmath62 ) .",
    "we also compared the actual distributions of @xmath49 obtained using simulation with the corresponding normal distribution ( matching the mean and variance ) . specifically , we simulated 1,000 replications of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as independent with 20hz firing rates , and also with dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath0 ( @xmath63=0.1 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the normal quantile - quantile plots which should be linear if the normal distribution is correct .",
    "we conclude from this that , at least for the range of parameters considered here , the normal approximation is quite reasonable . in future work we will study the adequacy of the normal approximation and its refinement further .",

    "we characterize the strength of connection between a pair of neurons as the conditional probability that one neuron fires after a specified delay given that the other neuron has fired .",
    "this delay is usually caused by the axonal delay of spike propagation and the delay at synapses due to chemical diffusion . by building a statistical model f ! or the number of non - overlapped occurrences of a serial episode , we showed that the frequency ( number of non - overlapped occurrences ) of an episode can be directly used to estimate the strength of connections among the neurons in a network , constituting the episode .",

    "the frequency threshold is a critical parameter .",
    "hence an important problem in frequent pattern discovery is to relate the frequency to some generic characteristics of the data source so that one can fix the frequency threshold automatically using sound statistical considerations .",
    "our approach of using the conditional probability to characterize the strength of interaction between neurons is generic and would be useful in many temporal datamining contexts . in analyzing any symbolic time series data to unearth interesting patterns in the form of episodes ,",
    "the motivation is that such patterns represent dependencies among the symbolic event types that are inherent to the data source .",
    "thus , the conditional probability that one event type would appear in the data stream after some time given that another has appeared , would be a useful characterization for the strength of the dependencies that we want to unearth .",

    "we have assumed that the inter - event time constraints which represent the time delays in neuronal connections are constants . in general",
