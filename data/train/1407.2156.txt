    "in the past decade , our understanding of the evolution of the universe , its components and respective abundances has increased to an unprecedented level . results from various independent observations of different scales have provided us with evidence for dark matter .",
    "supernovae combined with other independent observations suggest that the universe is currently undergoing accelerated expansion , possibly due to a negative pressure component usually dubbed `` dark energy '' .",
    "we have also learned from analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation that the universe is close to flat and that the large scale structure developed through gravitational instability from a spectrum of adiabatic , nearly gaussian and nearly scale invariant density perturbations .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with the predictions of the simplest inflationary paradigm , a short period of accelerated expansion in the early universe , introduced to explain the flatness , homogeneity and isotropy of the universe .",
    "scalar fields are the most popular building blocks to construct candidate models of early universe inflation and of the present day cosmological acceleration .",
    "they are appealing because such fields are ubiquitous in theories of high energy physics beyond the standard model .",
    "models are usually constructed using a single field , however , there is also the interesting possibility that a cosmological behaviour arises from the presence of multiple scalar fields . the idea that our universe contains a vast number of light scalar fields is also based on expectations from landscape models , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "assisted inflation is an example of a model where many fields can cooperate to sustain inflation even if none is able to fuel it if evolving in isolation .",
    "assisted inflation for exponential potentials was proposed in @xcite and extended in @xcite and the inclusion of a background fluid was evaluated in ref .",
    "it was studied for quadratic and quartic potentials in the context of higher dimensional reduction in ref .",
    "@xcite , for bianchi models @xcite , for an ensemble of tachyon fields @xcite , in braneworld models @xcite , in particular string theory realisations @xcite and taking into account loop quantum cosmology corrections @xcite .",
    "a multi - field dynamics was also studied in the context of logamediate inflation @xcite and k - inflation @xcite .",
    "a set of several fields working together could also give rise to the accelerated evolution of the universe we currently observe .",
    "this is usually known as assisted dark energy or assisted quintessence @xcite .",
    "these fields could , of course , interact with the rest of the world and new forces between matter particles would arise . for common particles ,",
    "these forces are tightly constrained by solar system and gravitational experiments on earth .",
    "limits on these forces are not so strong for interactions involving neutrinos or dark matter and current bounds come from cosmological observations .",
    "coupled quintessence , where a scalar field interacts with dark matter was introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and its dynamics , properties and possible couplings was studied in refs .",
    ".    there might be , however , more than one dark matter species , a suggestion made in refs .",
    "the possibility that a scalar field is indeed coupled to more than a single dark matter component has been raised recently in ref .",
    "@xcite and the phenomenology of such a set up was investigated and compared to observations in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a natural extension of these works is , therefore , to investigate the cosmological dynamics considering a group of several scalar fields coupled to various dark matter components .",
    "such a system has been addressed in ref .",
    "here we extend that work with an explicit analysis of the background and of linear perturbations . in section",
    "ii we introduce the general equations for @xmath0 scalar fields coupled to @xmath1 matter components .",
    "we then apply these to scalar potentials consisting of a sum of exponential terms in section iii , and an exponential of a sum of terms in section iv .",
    "we follow this in section v with the solutions where the scalar potential is negligible .",
    "in section vi we extend our analysis to the linear perturbations .",
    "finally we conclude in section vii .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath0 scalar fields @xmath2 cross - coupled to an ensemble of @xmath1 dark matter components @xmath3 .",
    "the cross - couplings are described by the matrix @xmath4 where latin indexes @xmath5 identify scalar field indexes and greek indexes @xmath6 identify the dark matter components .",
    "the equation of motion for the fields and the various dark matter components in a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric with scale factor @xmath7 is then written as @xmath8 the solution for the dark matter component evolution can be given immediately in terms of the values of the fields as @xmath9 the rate of change of the hubble function is @xmath10 subject to the friedmann constraint @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "in the next two sections we consider two possible forms for @xmath13 , both leading to scaling solutions : a sum of exponential terms and an exponential of a sum of terms .",
    "the dark matter field can in principle include the baryon component .",
    "however in this case the coupling will have to satisfy the strong solar system constraints and be in practice negligible .",
    "with the aim of finding the critical points of the evolution , we will rewrite the equations of motion as a system of first order differential equations . to do this",
    "we define the new variables @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the evolution is now described by @xmath17 where a prime means differentiation with respect to @xmath18 and the friedmann equation now reads @xmath19 equation ( [ eqdhh ] ) also defines the effective equation of state parameter @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 and then , @xmath22      we will start by reviewing the case in which we can neglect the matter contributions ( @xmath23 ) studied in the context of assisted inflation . using eqns .",
    "( [ eqy1 ] ) , ( [ eqdhh ] ) and ( [ friedmann ] ) , we obtain that @xmath24 by using the friedmann equation the effective equation of state is obtained as @xmath25 where the effective slope , @xmath26 , given by @xmath27 describes the corresponding logarithmic slope in the potential needed to replicate the dynamics with only one field .",
    "this means that increasing the number of fields makes @xmath26 smaller and , therefore , easier to obtain an accelerated expansion even if the individual slopes are too large to fuel it if acting in isolation .",
    "this effective slope @xmath26 is similar to the result obtained in the assisted inflation scenarios that were studied in @xcite .",
    "the system of equations has many fixed points , but we are particularly interested in the case when all the variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are non - vanishing since these are the most interesting in cosmology . using eqns .",
    "( [ eqy1 ] ) and ( [ eqz1 ] ) and considering for a moment only two fields , the fixed points of the system are at @xmath31 where @xmath32 equations ( [ eqz1 ] ) also provide the constraint @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we can now compute the effective equation of state parameter of the universe knowing that @xmath35 it is obtained that @xmath36 substituting for @xmath37 and @xmath38 as found earlier , we can write @xmath39 where @xmath40 . making use of the property that @xmath41 we can define and effective coupling of the system such that @xmath42 to write @xmath43 moreover , @xmath44 and given the equality @xmath45 , it results that the total contribution of the fields to the total energy budget is @xmath46 substituting now for @xmath37 and @xmath38 we obtain that @xmath47 where the effective @xmath26 is given by @xmath48 a typical evolution of the energy densities is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot1 ] .",
    "evolution of energy densities for the sum of exponentials potential with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 . ]",
    "the generalization to more than two fields is fairly trivial for this potential .",
    "( [ x1a ] ) and ( [ x2a ] ) are still valid for @xmath0 fields @xmath55 @xmath1 dark matter components and in general we have , @xmath56 for every @xmath57 .",
    "it is also instructive to consider how these quantities simplify when we consider that all the fields are just replicas of , say , the field @xmath58 . by this",
    "we mean that the matrix @xmath59 is diagonal with entries @xmath60 and @xmath61 for all indexes @xmath62 .",
    "it is easy to verify that in this case @xmath63 and @xmath64 and consequently @xmath65 takes the same value as for a single field system , however , @xmath66 has a slight dependence on the number of fields @xmath0 as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : eff1 ] .",
    "dependence of @xmath20 ( triangles ) and @xmath67 ( circles ) with the number of fields in the case when all fields are replicas of the same field and for the sum of exponentials potential .",
    "we used @xmath49 and @xmath68 . ]",
    "for this case we only need to define one single @xmath70 such that , @xmath71 the evolution is now described by @xmath72 where the friedmann equation now reads @xmath73      when the matter components are negligible ( @xmath23 ) , we can use eqns .",
    "( [ eqy2 ] ) , ( [ eqdhh ] ) and ( [ friedmann2 ] ) to obtain @xmath74 and then the equation of state parameter reads @xmath75 where the effective slope , @xmath26 is now @xmath76 for this case , increasing the number of fields increases the value of @xmath26 and an accelerated expansion becomes more difficult to be attained .",
    "again , this mimics previous results obtained in an assisted inflation setting in @xcite .      in order to find the critical points corresponding to the scaling solution , when all the variables @xmath28 , @xmath70 and @xmath30 are non - vanishing , we could proceed as for the previous potential . however , it is considerably easier to first start with a redefinition of variables",
    ". let us observe that the evolution equations are invariant under an orthogonal transformation of @xmath28 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "that is , @xmath79 were @xmath80 is an orthogonal matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath81 .    we will now give a working example for two fields and two dark matter components .",
    "we will show that , in the case of this potential it is always possible to rotate the fields such that @xmath82 .",
    "looking for the case where all the variables @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are non - vanishing , from eqs .",
    "( [ eqy2 ] ) and ( [ eqz2 ] ) , we obtain the conditions @xmath86 it is easy to show that when @xmath87 the solution yields @xmath82 . using the orthogonal transformation ( [ ortrans2 ] ) with the condition @xmath87 , @xmath88 together with the constraint that the rows of @xmath89 are unit vectors , @xmath90 ,",
    "gives us the result @xmath91 where we have chosen the positive roots .",
    "since @xmath92 we do not need to compute the rest of the matrix @xmath89 .",
    "we can now obtain the effective coupling @xmath93 and the effective @xmath26 , @xmath94 the scaling solution can then be written as @xmath95 we can then compute the effective equation of state parameter and the total scalar field contribution from the expressions @xmath96    it is straightforward to extend these results to the case of @xmath0 scalar fields and @xmath0 dark matter components .",
    "we can have @xmath97 for @xmath98 provided that @xmath99 this can always be achieved through the orthogonal transformation eqs  ( [ ortrans1])([ortrans3 ] ) .",
    "again we only really need to obtain the first row @xmath100 , of the @xmath89 matrix to obtain the value of the effective coupling @xmath101 .",
    "this comes through the solution to the equation @xmath102 for any @xmath62 , together with the unitarity condition , @xmath103 .",
    "once we have @xmath104 we can obtain the effective slope @xmath26 @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath67 and @xmath20 will be given by the same eqs .",
    "( [ hatx1])([omegaeff2 ] ) .    to see how this would work ,",
    "let us look at the simple case of a diagonal coupling matrix @xmath59 . in this case , we get for @xmath104 @xmath107 such that @xmath108    when all the fields are a copy of field @xmath58 , then the expressions become fairly simple and give @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "for this potential both @xmath20 and @xmath67 have a strong dependence on the number of fields @xmath111 which is illustrated in fig .  [ fig : eff2 ] for @xmath49 and @xmath68 .",
    "dependence of @xmath20 ( triangles ) and @xmath67 ( circles ) with the number of fields in the case when all fields are replicas of the same field and for the exponential of sum of fields potential .",
    "we used @xmath49 and @xmath68 . ]",
    "we can find fixed point solutions where the scalar potential energy density is negligible , so these solutions are independent of the type of scalar potential used .",
    "these can be divided into three different types .",
    "this critical point corresponds to the case where the scalar potential is negligible and the total energy density is comprised of the scalar fields kinetic energies and the dark matter components .",
    "we can use either eq .",
    "( [ eqz1 ] ) or ( [ eqz2 ] ) and the friedmann constraint to obtain @xmath112 for any @xmath113 .",
    "this immediately gives the simple expression for the equation of state parameter and the total scalar field contribution @xmath114      this critical point occurs when only the kinetic energy of the fields is non - vanishing .",
    "it is immediately obtained that @xmath115 and @xmath116      the matter dominated solution is the fixed point characterized by @xmath117 , @xmath118 , ( or @xmath119 ) and @xmath120 which essentially means that the partial derivative with respect to the field @xmath2 of the sum of all the dark matter contributions must vanish .",
    "this solution was discussed in a number of recent publications for a single field system and two dark matter components with symmetric couplings @xcite . for the simple system of two fields and two dark matter components we obtain that the field must settle at the bottom of a valley defined by the flat direction in the @xmath58@xmath121 plane , @xmath122 for consistency , we observe that the couplings must satisfy the simple relation @xmath123 otherwise the flat direction is non - existent and the field will keep on evolving .",
    "this solution is necessarily unstable . as the dark matter contribution decays with @xmath124 , eventually the scaling solution or the scalar field dominated solution",
    "becomes more important .",
    "such an example is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot1dmdom ] .",
    "this critical point allows the dark matter to have a substantial contribution before the scaling regime and before the universe accelerates .",
    "example of a matter dominated solution followed by a scaling solution by only one of the dark matter components .",
    "evolution of energy densities for the sum of exponentials potential with @xmath49 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
    "the initial condition for the scalar fields is very near the bottom of the effective potential which causes the initial oscillations before @xmath130 . ]",
    "we now extend our analysis to linear perturbations . this would allow to test the multi - coupled model with current and future data on galaxy clustering .",
    "we perturb the flat - space metric as @xmath131 where @xmath132 are functions of space and time , and expand the fields as @xmath133 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for the various fields can be written as @xmath134 and for the component @xmath113 of dark matter as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the four - velocity of component @xmath113 of the matter fluid .",
    "the conservation equations then read @xmath137 we want to obtain the equations for the linear perturbations around the background values for the fields , @xmath138 and for the matter components @xmath139 .",
    "we define the field perturbations as @xmath140 and the matter density contrasts as @xmath141 .",
    "going to fourier space , we obtain the following equations of motion for the @xmath2 field perturbations of wavenumber @xmath142 @xmath143 and for the density contrast of the matter component @xmath113 , @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 is the velocity of the @xmath113 component of the matter fluid .    by differentiation we then get , @xmath147    the @xmath148 component of einstein s equations for @xmath149 yields @xmath150 and using this equality from now on , the @xmath151 component gives @xmath152 combining eqs .",
    "( [ phiddot ] ) and ( [ deltaddot ] ) and working in the limit of small scales , _ s.t .",
    "_ , @xmath153 , it turns out that the equation of motion for the linear matter perturbations is    @xmath154    using as time variable , @xmath18 , we can rewrite these equations of motion in the form @xmath155 which can also be written , using the definition of @xmath28 , as @xmath156    it should be clear that for a given @xmath113 component a too large positive or negative @xmath157 , might imply , respectively , a very strong growth or damping of @xmath158 , a situation that must be avoided .    for the case of two scalar fields coupling with two components of dark matter , the equations for the matter linear perturbations become @xmath159    that is , for a scaling solution they are of the form @xmath160 where @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 are all constants .",

    "when @xmath170 and @xmath171 we can substitute the solutions in the above equations and obtain a set of equations to estimate @xmath166 and @xmath167 given by @xmath172 which give the analytical results @xmath173.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of course this approximation is only reliable when the assumptions @xmath174 are indeed verified .",
    "this happens for instance when @xmath175 , i.e. when one of the dark matter component is much smaller than the other .",
    "the growth rate @xmath176 can be then directly compared to observations .",
    "this will be performed in future work .",
    "we have studied a cosmological system composed of a set of scalar fields coupled to an ensemble of dark matter components , thus generalizing previous work .",
    "the obtained solution can either be applied to construct early universe inflationary solutions or provide a mechanism to explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe and the ratio of abundances between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "more specifically , we have investigated two representative types of potential leading to analytical solutions .",
    "we have seen that the scalar field dominated solution allows for an inflationary evolution which is easier to attain with the sum of exponentials potential .",
    "the effective coupling of the scaling solution has an explicit dependence on the value of the coupling @xmath4 and the potential parameters , @xmath77 , for the sum of exponentials potential . for the exponential of a sum potential ,",
    "however , the effective coupling can be written solely in terms of the individual couplings .",
    "we found a relation between the value of the couplings in order to obtain an early dust like dominated behaviour .",
    "essentially , the fields must settle at the bottom of the effective potential which has a flat direction .",
    "finally , we observed that the equations of motion for the matter density contrasts possess a source or damping term which might lead to an unacceptable growth or damping of the density contrast .",
    "it would be interesting to carry out a numerical analysis to test the range of parameter space for which these models are compatible with current and forecasted future large scale structure data .",
