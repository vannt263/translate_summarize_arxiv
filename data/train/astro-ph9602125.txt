    "beginning with the discovery of sn 1992bi ( perlmutter et al 1995 ) , we have developed search techniques and rapid analysis methods that allow systematic discovery and follow up of `` batches '' of high - redshift supernovae . the observing strategy developed compares large numbers of galaxies in each of @xmath350 fields observed twice with a separation of @xmath33 weeks .",
    "this search schedule makes it possible to precisely calculate the `` control time , '' the effective time during which the survey is sensitive to a type ia event .    for this analysis ,",
    "we have studied a set of 52 similar search fields observed in december 1993 and january 1994 .",
    "the data were obtained using the `` thick '' @xmath4 eev5 camera at the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope , la palma .",
    "the projected pixel size is @xmath5 , giving an image area of approximately @xmath6 .",
    "exposure times were 600s in the @xmath7 filter , and the images typically reach a @xmath8 limit of @xmath9mag . seeing was typically around @xmath10 .",
    "many of the fields were selected due to the presence of a high - redshift cluster ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "suitable clusters and their redshifts were taken from gunn , hoessel & oke ( 1986 ) and from the rosat catalog .",
    "the total useful area covered in this study is 1.73 sq deg .",
    "the analysis procedure and method for finding sne can be summarized as follows . for most fields , two first - look `` reference '' images were obtained and for all fields two second look `` search '' images were obtained @xmath12 weeks after the reference images .",
    "the images were flat - fielded and zero - points for the images were estimated by comparison with e ( red ) magnitudes of stars in the apm ( automated plate measuring facility , cambridge , uk ) possi catalog ( mcmahon & irwin 1992 ) .",
    "the search images were combined ( after convolution to match the seeing of the worst of the four images ) and the combined reference images were subtracted from this after scaling in intensity .",
    "the resulting difference image for each field was searched for sn candidates .    in this subset of the search data",
    "three sne were found with redshifts 0.354 , 0.375 and 0.420 determined from spectra of the host galaxies .",
    "for the purposes of this analysis , we assume these are all type ia sne ( see perlmutter et al .",
    "the method used to calculate the rate can be divided into two main parts : ( i ) estimation of the number of galaxies and the total stellar luminosity ( measured in @xmath13 ) to which the survey is sensitive and ( ii ) estimation of the sn detection efficiency and hence the control time .",
    "in order to compare the distant sn rate with local equivalents , we need to know the redshifts of the galaxies we have surveyed . in this work we use the galaxy counts derived from the analysis of lilly et al ( 1995 ) to estimate the number of galaxies sampled as a function of redshift .",
    "@xmath14 band counts as a function of redshift were calculated by lilly based on the analysis of magnitude ",
    "redshift data obtained in the canada - france redshift survey ( lilly et al , 1995 and references therein ) . to check that the assumed distribution of galaxies with @xmath14 magnitude and redshift , @xmath15 , give reasonable galaxy counts compared to our data ,",
    "we have plotted the number of field galaxies classified by the focas software package , as a function of apparent magnitude , on one of the search images that was _ not _ targeted at a galaxy cluster .",
    "the r - band galaxy counts given by the analysis of lilly et al ( 1995 ) integrated over the redshift range @xmath16 ( dash - dotted line ) are shown on the same scale , assuming an effective area for this image of 0.03 sq deg ( figure  [ nofm ] ) .",
    "many of our search fields were chosen specifically to target high - redshift clusters .",
    "for each of these fields , we estimate the number of cluster galaxies by counting galaxies as a function of @xmath14 magnitude in a box of size @xmath17 pixels centered approximately on the center of the cluster as estimated by eye from the images .",
    "the counts in a similar box in a region of the image away from the cluster were subtracted from the cluster counts to give the cluster excess counts as a function of @xmath14 mag .",
    "typically a cluster contributes 10% of the galaxy counts on an image .",
    "we assign these galaxies to the cluster redshift , and add the cluster contribution to the @xmath15 for that image given by the models .",
    "values of reddening due to the galaxy were supplied by d. burstein ( derived from burstein & heiles , 1982 ) for each field and applied to the data assuming @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( cardelli et al , 1989 ) .",
    "to calculate the control times we assumed that sn magnitude as a function of time follows the average of the best - fit , time - dilated and @xmath20-corrected leibundgut ( 1988 ) type ia template light curves ( the generalized @xmath20 correction described by kim et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and kim , goobar & perlmutter ( 1995 ) , was used here ) .",
    "the control time is then given by the weighted sum of days during which the sn can be detected , where the weighting is by the detection efficiency , @xmath21 .    this detection efficiency is a function of the magnitude difference @xmath22 ( zero if @xmath22 is negative ) , which is itself a function of time @xmath23 relative to maximum , and @xmath24 , the time separation of the search and reference images .",
    "it depends on the quality of the subtracted images ( seeing , transmission ) together with the detailed technique ( convolution , selection criteria ) used to extract the signal ( sne candidates ) from the background ( cosmic rays , asteroids , bad subtractions , etc ) .",
    "in addition , there is a slight dependence on the host galaxy magnitude .",
    "the detection efficiency was calculated using a monte - carlo method .",
    "a synthetic image was created for every field by adding simulated supernovae to the search images using point - spread - functions drawn from each search image .",
    "the reference images were subtracted from the synthetic search images using exactly the same software as used for the supernova search and the number of simulated sne that satisfy the selection criteria was determined .",
    "this technique allows us to measure detection efficiencies as a function of supernovae magnitude individually for every field , thus taking into account the other parameters mentioned above .",
    "figure  [ eff](a)-(c ) shows the fractional number of simulated sn recovered , as a function of sn magnitude ( at detection ) for the three fields in which sne were found .",
    "figure  [ eff](d ) shows the efficiency as a function of relative surface brightnesses of the sn and host galaxy .",
    "this last parameter gives an indication of the effect of sn location with respect to the host galaxy .",
    "although this is a small effect , it was taken into account . for a typical field the detection efficiency is over 85% for any added fake stellar object brighter than @xmath25 magnitude ( note that the more recent searches of this project have worked with significantly deeper images ) .",
    "before calculating the luminosity - weighted sn rate , we first determine a `` survey rate '' of sn discoveries that a search for ia sne can expect to obtain , per square degree .",
    "we give the rate in a range of 1 mag in @xmath14 , centered on the mean peak @xmath14 magnitude of the 3 sne found in this search , @xmath26 .",
    "the survey rate is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of sne we found in the 1 magnitude range , and @xmath29 is the control time for field @xmath30 , computed for a sn with magnitude @xmath26 at maximum . for example",
    "a value of @xmath31 days was found for the field containing sn1994h observed on 1993 december 19 and 1994 january 12 , 24 days apart .",
    "we measure a survey rate for @xmath32 of @xmath33 sne  @xmath34 ( the error quoted is statistical only ) . in practice",
    "this translates to 1.73 sne per square degree discovered with a 3 week baseline , in data with limiting magnitude @xmath35 ( @xmath36 for @xmath14=23 ) .      to calculate the rate in snu ,",
    "we compute the expected redshift distribution of sne , @xmath37 , which is proportional to the observed sn rate , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the rate in the rest - frame of the supernovae .",
    "it is given by @xmath40 where @xmath30 runs over all fields , @xmath14 is the galaxy apparent @xmath14 magnitude and @xmath41 is the galaxy rest - frame b band luminosity in units of @xmath13 .",
    "the control times @xmath42 , in units of centuries , have been calculated for each field in bins of @xmath43 and @xmath14 ( the size of the bins is 0.5 mag in @xmath14 , 0.05 in @xmath43 ) .    to compute the rest - frame b band galaxy luminosities from apparent @xmath14 magnitudes , we used @xmath44 colors and @xmath45-band @xmath20 corrections supplied by gronwall & koo .",
    "note that the combined color , @xmath20 and evolution correction is small in the redshift range of interest ( @xmath46 ) since the observed @xmath14 band is close to the rest - frame b - band . in this calculation @xmath47 and @xmath48 were assumed .",
    "the rest frame supernovae rate @xmath39 at @xmath0 was obtained by fitting the redshift distribution of observed sne to the expected distribution , @xmath37 using a maximum - likelihood fit using poisson statistics . the mean redshift corresponding to this rate is @xmath49 .",
    "we derive a value for the sn rate of @xmath50 where the error is statistical only .",
    "we have studied various sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "table  [ systab ] summarizes their contributions .",
    "contribution & 0.02 galaxy extinction & 0.01 apm calibration & 0.10 detection efficiency & 0.08 non - standard sne & 0.29 scanning efficiency & @xmath51 total syst .",
    "uncertainty & @xmath52    [ systab ]    for given assumed galaxy counts , the main contribution comes from the fact that type ia sne are not perfect standard candles .",
    "we also tested the sensitivity of our result to the assumed form of galaxy evolution , @xmath15 , by recalculating the rate using the model of gronwall & koo ( 1995 ) and that used by glazebrook et al ( 1995 ) .",
    "these give values for the rate of @xmath53 snu and @xmath54 snu respectively .",
    "although there is a large difference in the results derived using the counts of lilly et al compared with the other models , we choose not to include this in the systematic uncertainty . for the purposes of this analysis we use the lilly et al counts ,",
    "since these are based on data that are well - matched to our survey in magnitude and redshift range , and only small amount of extrapolation was required in converting from the @xmath55 to @xmath14 band .",
    "host galaxy inclination and extinction effects could not be estimated following the analysis used for nearby searches because of the different detection techniques involved .",
    "a correct estimation would require modeling of galaxy opacities , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we therefore compare our uncorrected value with uncorrected values for nearby searches ,    altogether , we estimate the total systematic error to be @xmath56 and we assume the lilly et al counts for @xmath15 .",
    "this measurement is the first direct measurement of the type ia rate at high redshift . in their pioneering work searching for high redshift supernovae , hansen et al .",
    "( 1989 ) discovered a probable type ii event at @xmath57 and a type ia event at @xmath58 ( nrgaard - nielsen et al . , 1989 ) , however no estimates of sn ia rates were published based on this discovery .",
    "nearby supernovae rates have been carefully reanalyzed recently ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1993a & 1993b , turatto et al . , 1994 ,",
    "van den bergh and mcclure , 1994 , muller et al . 1992 ) using more precise methods for calculating the control times and correcting for inclination and over - exposure of the nuclear regions of galaxies in photographic searches .",
    "the rate obtained for type ia sne are now consistent among these groups and vary between 0.2 @xmath2  snu and 0.7 @xmath2  snu depending on the galaxy types ( e , sa etc . , higher rates are found in later type galaxies ) .",
    "taking into account the facts that at @xmath590.4 the ratios of galaxy type are different and using the type ia rates reported in cappellaro et al ( 1993b ) , we calculate a local rate of @xmath60 @xmath2 snu for the mix of galaxies expected at @xmath0 .",
    "our measured value of @xmath61 snu ( where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been combined ) , although slightly higher , agrees with this value within the uncertainty and indicates that type ia rates do not change dramatically out to @xmath590.4 .",
    "note , however that correcting for host galaxy extinction and inclination may change this conclusion .",
    "theoretical estimates of type ia sne rates have been derived from stellar and galaxy evolution models .",
    "calculations were done mostly for elliptical galaxy type .",
    "recent calculations , based on evolutionary models of elliptical galaxies , predict rates of @xmath62 snu ( ferrini & poggianti 1993 ) . assuming a factor of @xmath63 higher rate in non - elliptical galaxies compared to ellipticals ( capellaro et al .",
    "1993b ) and a mix of galaxy types as above , we convert this to an overall rate of type ia sne at @xmath64 in all galaxy types , and derive a value of @xmath65 snu .",
    "our total uncertainty of @xmath66 in the measurement presented in this paper does not allow any firm conclusion but our observed rate seems to lie above this theoretical prediction .",
    "there may be an increase of type ia rate with redshift .",
    "ruiz - lapuente , burkert & canal ( 1995 ) predict significant increase in rate for redshifts between 0.4 and 0.8 depending on the specific model they consider . in the near future ,",
    "our ongoing high-@xmath43 sn search and others should provide enough data to constrain the theoretical calculations .    this work was supported in part by the national science foundation ( adt-88909616 ) and the u.s .",
