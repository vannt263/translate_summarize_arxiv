    "in this paper , we study the nonlinear and nonlocal hartree initial - boundary value problem for the ( wave ) function @xmath0 being defined by stands for the derivative of @xmath1 w.r.t . the time variable @xmath2 . ]",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 is some domain in @xmath5 with boundary @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is some upper limit of the time interval on which we want to study the time evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 stands for an external potential , @xmath9 denotes the coupling strength , and @xmath10 is the interaction potential responsible for the nonlinear and nonlocal interaction generated by the convolution .",
    "the system has many physical applications , in particular for the case @xmath11 . as a first application",
    ", we mention the appearance of within the context of the quantum mechanical description of large systems of nonrelativistic bosons in their so - called mean field limit . for the case of a local nonlinearity ,",
    "i.e. @xmath12 , an important application of equation lies in the domain of bose - einstein condensation for repulsive interatomic forces where it governs the condensate wave function and is called the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "this dynamical equation , and its corresponding energy functional in the stationary case , have been derived rigorously ( see for example @xcite and @xcite , respectively . ) . in @xcite ,",
    "minimizers of this nonlocal hartree functional have been studied in the attractive case , and symmetry breaking has been established for sufficiently large coupling .",
    "a large coupling phase segregation phenomenon has also been rigorously derived for a system of two coupled hartree equations which are used to describe interacting bose - einstein condensates ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such coupled systems also appear in the description of crossing sea states of weakly nonlinear dispersive surface water waves in hydrodynamics ( see for example @xcite ) , of electromagnetic waves in a kerr medium in nonlinear optics , and in nonlinear plasma physics .",
    "furthermore , we would like to mention that equation with attractive interaction potential possesses a so - called point particle limit .",
    "consider the situation where the initial condition is composed of several interacting hartree minimizers sitting in an external potential which varies slowly on the length scale defined by the extension of the minimizers .",
    "it turns out that , in a time regime inversely related to this scale , the center of mass of each minimizer follows a trajectory which is governed , up to a small friction term , by newton s equation of motion for interacting point particles in the slowly varying external potential .",
    "hence , in this limit , the system can be interpreted as the motion of interacting extended particles in a shallow external potential and weakly coupled to a dispersive environment with which mass and energy can be exchanged through the friction term .",
    "this allows to describe , and hence to numerically compute , some type of structure formation in newtonian gravity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main content of the present paper consists in setting up the framework for the numerical analysis on bounded @xmath4 which will be used in @xcite for the study through numerical computation of such phenomena , like , for example , the dissipation through radiation for a hartree minimizer oscillating in an external confining potential ( see also @xcite ) .    in section [ sec : cp ] , we start off with a brief study of the hartree initial - value boundary problem in the continuum setting and we discuss its existence - uniqueness and regularity properties . in section",
    "[ sec : semidiscrete ] , the system is discretized in space with the help of galerkin theory .",
    "we derive existence - uniqueness and a bound on the @xmath13-approximation error . in the main section [ sec : fd ] , we proceed to the full discretization of , more precisely , we discretize the foregoing semidiscrete problem in time focusing on two time discretization schemes of crank - nicholson type .",
    "the first is the so - called one - step one - stage gauss - legendre runge - kutta method which conserves the mass of the discretized wave function under the discrete time evolution .",
    "the second one is the so - called delfour - fortin - payre scheme which , besides the mass , also conserves the energy of the system .",
    "we prove existence - uniqueness using contraction methods suitable for implementation in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we derive a time quadratic accuracy estimate on the @xmath13-error of these approximation schemes . in the proofs of these assertions , we write down rather explicit expressions for the bounds in order to have some qualitative idea how to achieve a good numerical control of the fully discrete approximations of the hartree initial - value boundary problem for the computation of delicate nonlinear and nonlocal features of the various physical scenarios discussed above .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we start off by briefly studying the hartree initial - boundary value problem in a suitable continuum setting . for this purpose",
    ", we make the following assumptions concerning the domain @xmath4 , the external potential @xmath8 , and the interaction potential @xmath10 , a choice which is motivated by the perspective of the fully discrete problem and the numerical analysis dealt with in section [ sec : fd ] and the numerical computations in @xcite .
