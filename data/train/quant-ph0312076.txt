    "many potential quantum information processing systems are controlled by means of a set of time - dependent parameters , such as quasi - static electromagnetic fields @xcite , radio - frequency , @xcite , or optical fields @xcite . for most such systems , it is relatively simple to device a set of controls that implement a given evolution in an ideal situation . often , however , a more careful choice of controls can lead to an implementation that is less sensitive to variations in unknown or uncontrollable system parameters .",
    "examples of such robust implementations include system specific solutions such as the hot gate for ion trap quantum computing which is insensitive to vibrational excitations @xcite , as well as more general techniques such as composite pulses , a technique originating in nmr spectroscopy @xcite .    in this article",
    "we describe a numerical method for designing robust controls for systems where the evolution is adequately described by a possibly non - unitary evolution operator @xmath0 .",
    "this form does not allow a general master equation formulation , but it is sufficient to establish worst case behavior in many quantum computing settings where the worst case effects of decoherence and loss can be adequately modeled by a schrdinger equation with a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "as an application of the method , we will consider the construction of a robust phase shift operation for the rare earth quantum computing ( reqc ) system @xcite , which is based on rare - earth ions embedded in a cryogenic crystal . in each ion ,",
    "two metastable ground - state hyperfine levels , labeled @xmath1 and @xmath2 , serve as a qubit register which is manipulated via optical transitions from both states to an inhomogeneously shifted excited state @xmath3 .",
    "the reqc system is an ensemble quantum computing system and macroscopic numbers of ions are manipulated in parallel , addressed by the value of the inhomogeneous shift of their @xmath3-state . to obtain a sufficient number of ions within each frequency channel ,",
    "it is necessary to operate on all ions within a finite range of inhomogeneous shifts , and the main difficulty in operating the reqc system is to achieve the same evolution for each of these ions independent of their particular inhomogeneous shift .    this article is divided into two sections : in section [ sec : design - robust - puls ] we describe the method we have used to design robust gate implementations ; these results should be applicable to a variety of quantum information processing systems . in section [ sec : optimal - control - reqc ] we present the results of applying the method to a specific problem relating to the reqc system , and show that it is indeed possible to obtain very high degrees of robustness .",
    "we consider a collection of quantum system which evolve according to a set of time - dependent controls @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to @xmath5 , the single system hamiltonian @xmath6 depends on a system specific set of uncontrollable or unknown parameters @xmath7 , such as field strength or quantum numbers corresponding to unused degrees of freedom .",
    "the evolution of each system is governed by the schrdinger equation , @xmath8 where we will allow the hamiltonian @xmath9 to include non - hermitian terms describing loss and decoherence .",
    "our goal is to choose a set of controls that lead to an evolution @xmath10 which is as close as possible to a given desired evolution @xmath11 over a range of @xmath7-values . to quantify this",
    ", we introduce an objective functional @xmath12 which describes the performance of a set of controls @xmath5 for a given value of @xmath7 . by convention",
    "we take a low value of @xmath13 to indicate a good performance , and the problem of finding a robust set of controls thus corresponds to minimizing @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the set of @xmath7-values for which we want the implementation to perform well . the conceptually simple approach we have taken to this problem",
    "is to replace @xmath15 with a discrete subset @xmath16 , so that the minimization of @xmath17 has the form of a standard minimax problem , which can be solved efficiently provided that we are able to calculate @xmath18 . below",
    "we show how to achieve this by methods from optimal control theory .      in this section",
    "we show how @xmath19 may be calculated for a quite general class of objective functionals . to keep the notation simple and avoid unnecessary restrictions",
    ", we will consider the following generalization of the schrdinger equation , @xmath20 determining the evolution of a complex - valued , time - dependent matrix @xmath21 due to a set of real - valued , time - dependent controls , @xmath4 .",
    "we will consider objective functionals of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a real - valued function quantifying how close the final state @xmath10 is to our goal , and the real valued function @xmath24 , referred to as a penalty function , can be chosen to discourage the use of certain control values .",
    "our goal is to calculate @xmath19 subject to the constraint that @xmath5 and @xmath21 obey eq . .",

    "if we require @xmath26 to obey the adjoint equations @xmath28 where @xmath21 and @xmath29 should be considered as independent with respect to the partial derivative and @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 we find by integration by parts that the differential of @xmath27 is given by @xcite @xmath32 from which the derivatives of @xmath13 with respect to the parameters used to parametrize @xmath5 can be calculated by the chain rule .",
    "we now return to the case of a quantum system governed by the schrdinger equation . if we assume the penalty function @xmath33 to be independent of @xmath21 , the adjoint equations in this case are @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "is given by with @xmath36 the role of the adjoint state and the adjoint equations is often described as back - propagating the errors in achieving the desired final state .",
    "if @xmath9 is hermitian , the boundary value for @xmath26 can be optimized for numerical computation as shown in appendix [ sec : optimized - co - state ] .      we will now discuss the choice of the function @xmath37 , quantifying how well the obtained evolution @xmath10 approximates @xmath11 .",
    "as we are concerned with quantum information processing we will assume that all operations start out with an unknown state in the qubit subspace @xmath38 of the full system hilbert space @xmath39 , and that this subspace is invariant under the ideal evolution @xmath11 .",
    "the function @xmath37 should not depend on the evolution of states outside @xmath38 , nor on collective phases on the states originating in @xmath38 .",
    "a cautious choice of @xmath37 fulfilling these conditions could be based on the worst case overlap fidelity @xcite : @xmath40 which measures the least possible overlap between the obtained output state @xmath41 and the ideal output @xmath42 for initial states in @xmath38 .",
    "this fidelity measure has the desirable quality that both population transfer from @xmath38 to @xmath43 and population transfer completely out of @xmath39 , as described by a non - unitary evolution , is counted as loss of fidelity .    from the point of view of optimal control , a significant drawback of the worst case overlap fidelity , @xmath44 ,",
    "is that it is computationally complicated @xcite .",
    "a computationally accessible fidelity measure which share many appealing features with @xmath44 is the trace fidelity @xcite , @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "as shown in appendix [ sec : trace - fidelity ] , @xmath47 is related to @xmath44 by the strict bound @xmath48 indicating that we can safely replace @xmath44 by @xmath47 for numerical computations on a few qubits at high fidelity .    for numerical calculations",
    "it is beneficial to use @xmath49 rather than @xmath47 @xcite ; in the calculations presented in the next section we have used @xmath50 , leading to an adjoint state boundary condition of @xmath51 which can be directly computed .",
    "one approach to minimizing @xmath13 is to directly solve the extremum condition @xmath52 for @xmath5 .",
    "this task is significantly simplified if a penalty function proportional to @xmath53 is introduced , @xmath54 , so that the extremum condition according to reads , @xmath55 which may be used as an iterative formula for calculating @xmath5",
    ". variations over this iterative approach give rise to the krotov @xcite and zhu - rabitz @xcite algorithms which have been shown to have excellent convergence properties , and have been successfully applied to optimal control of unitary transformations for one set of parameters by the group of r. kosloff @xcite . a unifying view of these direct methods",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the work presented here",
    "we have chosen to use an indirect minimization algorithm : rather than trying to solve the extremum condition directly , we have used the gradient information obtained through eq . as input for a general sequential quadratic programming procedure based on a constrained quasi - newton method @xcite .",
    "the primary advantage of this approach is that we have total freedom to choose the parametrization of the controls , and can place arbitrary bounds on these .",
    "this allows us to more accurately model the fact that the experimental limitations most often only distinguish between possible and impossible controls : no possible controls are significantly harder than others .",
    "an explicit field strength limit also serves to introduce an absolute scale on which to introduce decay strengths etc .",
    "-pulse sequence ( dashed line ) and the optimized ( solid line ) implementation of @xmath11 on far - detuned ions , as described by @xmath56 , where @xmath44 is calculated with respect to the identity , as these ions should ideally not be disturbed .",
    "both implementations achieve worst case fidelities very close to unity , with the @xmath57-pulse sequence achieving the best results .",
    "the curve for the optimized pulse is actually a running maximum , as the actual value of @xmath56 oscillates with a period of @xmath58 .",
    ", width=317 ]    the motivation for the work presented in this article has been the design of robust gate implementations for the reqc system mentioned in the introduction . as an example",
    ", we will consider the construction of a robust implementation of the single qubit operation @xmath59 which could simply be implemented by a single @xmath60 pulse on the @xmath1-@xmath3 transition if we were not concerned with robustness .",
    "our primary concern will be to make the implementation robust with respect to variations in the inhomogeneous shift @xmath61 of the @xmath3-state in order to allow the use of finite with channels .",
    "since it is experimentally difficult to obtain a homogeneous field strength over the crystal , we would also prefer the implementation to be insensitive to variations in the relative field strength , which we will denote @xmath62 .",
    "in addition to requiring the implementation of @xmath11 to be robust with respect to variations in @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we will add the requirement that ions outside the channels should not be affected , as this allows us to use the obtained implementation of @xmath11 as a part of a controlled phase shift operation @xcite : if the @xmath3-states of the qubit ion and a controlling ion are coupled sufficiently strongly by static dipole interaction , an excitation of the controlling ion will effectively shift the qubit ion out of the channel thus conditioning the evolution of the qubit on the state of the controlling ion .    even though the simplest implementation of @xmath11 for an ideal ion with @xmath63 and @xmath64 would involve only the @xmath1 and @xmath3 levels ,",
    "a robust implementation must also involve the @xmath2-state since the coupling of @xmath1 to @xmath3 will result in a @xmath61-dependent phase on @xmath1 which can only be compensated by introducing the same phase on the @xmath2-state , e.g. through phase compensating rotations @xcite .",
    "a highly successful example of this approach is the @xmath57-pulse sequence suggested by roos and mlmer @xcite , which as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : fidelities](a ) yields a very robust implementation , achieving high fidelities over a wide range of parameter values .",
    "we model the reqc system by the single ion hamiltonian @xmath65 which does not include any effects of decay or decoherence . in the notation introduced in section",
    "[ sec : design - robust - puls ] , the system parameters are @xmath66 , the controls are @xmath67 , and the qubit subspace is @xmath68 . no penalty function is used : we use @xmath69 , and limit the field by strict bounds on @xmath70 , as this is the relevant limiting parameter in the reqc system . inspired by the success of the @xmath57-based solution and the hat - like fourier spectrum of the @xmath57-pulse , @xmath70 is parametrized in terms of a truncated fourier basis . based on trial and error",
    "we have arrived at @xmath71 @xmath7-values to constitute @xmath72 , some within the neighborhood of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and some at large detunings where the ions should not be disturbed .",
    "the result of the optimization with this choice of @xmath72 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidelities](b ) , where the circles indicate the members of @xmath72 .",
    "it is evident from the plot that the optimization has achieved a high fidelity over an even larger range of parameters than the @xmath57-pulse sequence illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidelities](a ) .    with respect to not disturbing the detuned ions , both the optimized pulse and the @xmath57-pulses obtain fidelities within @xmath73 of unity for @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the maximal resonant rabi frequency at @xmath64 .",
    "as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig:3levavoid_edge ] , which only shows fidelities at @xmath64 as @xmath10 is nearly independent of @xmath62 at @xmath76 , the @xmath57-pulse sequence performs better than the optimized pulse in this regime .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to construct highly robust gate implementations for quantum information processing by a quite general method .",
    "in particular , the method has been used to greatly enhance the performance of a gate implementation for a model reqc system by extending the range of inhomogeneous shifts and relative field strengths over which an acceptable performance is achieved .",
    "the model reqc system used in this article ignores many performance degrading factors , the two most important being decoherence and implementation noise .",
    "decoherence could in the present case be adequately modeled by a non - hermitian hamiltonian , for which we expect the method described in this paper to be able to find a robust implementation as in the decoherence - free case .",
    "it is not clear , however , how the method could be extended to address the problem of robustness with respect to implementation imperfections .",

    "this research was funded by project esquire of the ist - fet programme of the ec .",
    "in this section we prove the relation between the worst case overlap fidelity , @xmath44 , and the trace fidelity @xmath47 . referring to the definition ,",
    "we note that @xmath44 is completely determined by the restriction @xmath77 of the operator @xmath78 to @xmath38 . since @xmath10 describes the evolution of a quantum system , it is possible to extend it to a unitary operation on a hilbert space containing @xmath39 , and @xmath77 is consequently the restriction of a unitary operator to @xmath38 . in the ideal case",
    "@xmath77 will be equal to the identity on @xmath38 , perhaps with the exception of a complex phase .",
    "@xmath44 is defined as the minimum of the overlap @xmath79 .",
    "since the unit sphere of @xmath80 is compact , this minimum will be attained for some @xmath81 : @xmath82 .",
    "we now extend @xmath83 to an orthonormal basis @xmath84 by the gram - schmidt process . evaluating the trace fidelity in this basis we find by the triangle inequality :    @xmath85    where we have used that @xmath86 for all @xmath87 since @xmath77 is the restriction of a unitary operator . by rewriting we obtain the desired relation , @xmath88 .",
    "we note that the established bound is strict in the sense that for any @xmath89 , the operator @xmath90 will fulfill eq . with equality for any @xmath87 .",
    "in the case of a hermitian hamiltonian and a penalty function @xmath33 , that does not depend on the state @xmath21 , it is possible to modify the adjoint state boundary condition to reduce the required accuracy of the adjoint state propagation .    in this case",

    "since @xmath9 and thus @xmath95 are assumed to be hermitian , @xmath35 as given by is not affected by adding to @xmath93 a component of @xmath96 for any real @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath93 and @xmath92 evolve according to the same schrdinger equation , this corresponds to modifying the boundary condition for the adjoint state to read : @xmath98 for any real @xmath97 .",
    "the obvious use of the freedom in the choice of boundary value is to minimize the norm of the adjoint state , in order to relax the requirements of the relative precision of the adjoint state propagation .",
    "this minimum is easily calculated from , but we prefer to illustrate the physical background of the result by calculating it in a different way : the freedom in the choice of boundary value is allowed by the hermiticity of @xmath9 .",
    "the same hermiticity ensures that @xmath92 is normalized , so that @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the normalization function @xmath101 , is equal to @xmath102 . the gradient of @xmath103 , however , is different from that of @xmath37 .",
