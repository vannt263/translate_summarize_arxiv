    "precise measurements of abundances of low metallicity stars have recently been obtained by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these provide new constraints for the stellar evolution models ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the most striking constraint is the need for primary @xmath5n production in very low metallicity massive stars .",
    "rotation helps producing large amounts of primary @xmath5n through mixing of newly synthesised carbon and oxygen during helium burning ( see @xcite and contributions by these authors in this volume ) .",
    "other constraints are an upturn of the c / o ratio with a [ c / fe ] about constant or slightly decreasing ( with increasing metallicity ) at very low metallicities , which requires an increase ( with increasing metallicity ) of oxygen yields below [ fe / h]@xmath2 -3 .",
    "this seems hard to reproduce with rotating models were mixing usually increases the size of the helium burning core and therefore increases the oxygen yields .",
    "the computer model used here is the same as the one described in @xcite .",
    "convective stability is determined by the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "overshooting is only considered for h and he  burning cores with an overshooting parameter , @xmath9 , of 0.1 h@xmath10 .",
    "since the distribution of velocities at very low metallicities is not well know , two initial rotational velocities were explored at very low metallicities .",
    "the first one is the same as at solar metallicity , 300kms@xmath4 .",
    "the ratio @xmath11 decreases at very low metallicities for the initial velocity of 300kms@xmath4 because stars are more compact at lower metallicities .",
    "however there are some indirect evidence ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) that stars rotate faster at low metallicities .",
    "therefore , the second @xmath12 is 500kms@xmath4 at z=10@xmath13 ( [ fe / h]@xmath14 - 3.1 ) and 600kms@xmath4 at z=10@xmath15 ( [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 6.1 ) .",
    "these values are chosen such that the ratio of the initial velocity to the break  up velocity , @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) , is slightly larger than the mean observed value for ob solar metallicity stars ( 0.63 ) .",
    "the evolution of the models was followed until core si  burning .",
    "the yields of these models were calculated in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "the bulk of @xmath5n is produced in the convective zone created by shell hydrogen burning .",
    "if this convective zone deepens enough to engulf carbon ( and oxygen ) rich layers , then significant amounts of primary @xmath5n can be produced ( @xmath20.03@xmath0 ) .",
    "this occurs in both the non  rotating model and the fast rotating model at @xmath3 but for different reasons . in the non  rotating model",
    ", it occurs due to structure rearrangements at the end of carbon burning similar to the third dredge  up . in the model with @xmath17600kms@xmath4",
    "it occurs during shell helium burning because of the strong mixing of carbon and oxygen into the hydrogen shell burning zone .",
    "the most interesting model is the one with @xmath12=600kms@xmath4 at @xmath3 .",
    "in the course of core helium burning , the increase in the strength of the shell h  burning ( due to mixing of c and o ) is so important that the star expands and the convective he ",
    "burning core becomes and remains smaller than at the start of core he  burning .",
    "the yield of @xmath8o is closely correlated with the size of the co core .",
    "therefore the yield of @xmath8o is reduced due to the strong mixing ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the observational constraints at very low z are a very high primary @xmath5n production , a flat or slightly decreasing [ c / fe ] ( with increasing metallicity ) and an upturn in [ c / o ] for [ fe / h]@xmath18 -3 @xcite .",
    "this requires not only extremely high primary @xmath5n production and a similar or larger @xmath19c production at very low z but also a reduced @xmath8o production in massive stars .",
    "all these criteria are best fulfilled in the models with values of the ratio of the initial velocity to the break  up velocity ( @xmath20 ) slightly larger than the mean observed value for ob solar metallicity stars ( 0.63 ) .",
    "it thus favours faster rotation at very low metallicities .",
    "the very large amounts of @xmath5n observed ( @xmath20.03@xmath0 ) are only produced at @xmath3 ( popii 1/2 ) .",
    "the strong dependence of the @xmath5n yields on rotation and other stellar parameters like the initial metallicity and mass ( see @xcite for the mass dependence at @xmath21 ) may explain the large scatter in the observations of @xmath5n abundance ."
