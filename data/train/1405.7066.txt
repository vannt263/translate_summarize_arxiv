    "calibrating an electric ( @xmath0 ) field probe and/or measuring an @xmath0-field can be challenging , and is somewhat of a chicken - or - egg dilemma . in that to calibrate a probe , one must place the probe ( sensor ) in a `` known '' field .",
    "however , to know the field we need a calibrated probe .",
    "there are various types of probes used .",
    "one example is the probe shown in fig .",
    "[ dipoleprobe ] , which consists of a diode placed across a dipole antenna .",
    "the output of the diode is connected to a dc volt - meter via a high - impedance line ( on the order of 10,000  k@xmath1/m ) @xcite . when placed in an e - field",
    ", the diode rectifies the electromagnetic ( em ) field and the dc voltage is recorded .",
    "this dc voltage increases or decreases with an increasing and decreasing em field strength . to use this dipole probe ,",
    "it first must be calibrated , which involves placing the probe in a known ( calculated ) field .",
    "the probes discussed above are typically used at frequencies well below the resonant frequency of the dipole , that is , these probes are electrically small .",
    "this is necessary to minimize perturbation of the measured field by the probe and to avoid wide variations in frequency response near the resonant frequency of the dipole .",
    "the impedance of the non - resonant dipole elements along with the characteristics of the voltage detector ( diode and rectifying circuit ) can result in a relatively constant response over a wide frequency range .",
    "this constant response is limited by the resonant frequency of the dipole at the upper end and the diminished response due to the small physical length at the lower frequencies . the 5-cm length probe shown in fig .",
    "[ dipoleprobe ] is useful as a probe up to about 2  ghz with calibration .",
    "probes for higher frequencies ( up to 40  ghz ) have been constructed using much smaller dipole elements ( 8  mm or less ) with tapered resistive dipole elements that suppress the resonance @xcite .",
    "the combination of very small dipole antennas , and diode detector circuits connected to resistive lines and high - impedance voltmeters , requires substantial @xmath0-field strength for reliable measurements .",
    "while fields can be detected in the range of 100  mv / m the amplitude uncertainties can be large .",
    "the useful sensitivity ( minimum field strength ) is typically on the order of 500 - 1000  mv / m @xcite and @xcite . while the probes can in principle",
    "be electrically small ( with the caveat that the sensitivity decreases as the probe size becomes smaller @xcite ) , the limiting factor on the overall size of the probe is due to both the electronics in the probe head and the size of dipole antenna required to drive the current across the diode .",
    "while this type of probe has been used for over 40 years , it does have the following limitations : ( 1 ) it needs be to calibrated , ( 2 ) the sensitivity of the probe is governed by the dipole length , ( 3 ) the metal in the probe perturbs the field being measured , and ( 4 ) the sensitivity of the probe is limited to a minimal detectable field strength of 100  mv / m .",
    "besides the dipole probe shown in fig .",
    "[ dipoleprobe ] , there are other types of probes .",
    "for example there are probes based on non - linear materials ( e.g. , lithium niobate crystals ) , where the phase of an optical signal propagating through this material changes when immersed in an e - field .",
    "while these types of probes can gain about one order of magnitude in sensitivity ( @xmath2  mv / m ) , they still require calibration and will perturb the field being measured .    in order to calibrate a probe ,",
    "the probe is placed in a `` known '' field . the most common way",
    "the generate a known field is to perform a measurement in an anechoic chamber ( ac ) or other type of test facility . for an ac configuration ,",
    "the probe is placed at a known distance ( say @xmath3 , typically 1  to  3  m ) from an antenna ( typically a horn antenna or open - ended waveguide ) . with maxwell s equations and the dimensions of the horn antenna , the field strength at the distance @xmath3",
    "is calculated for a given input power to the horn antenna .",
    "the probe is placed in this `` known '' field and the output of the probe is recorded . due to the uncertainties in this approach ,",
    "the `` known '' field is only typically known to within 5  @xmath4 ( or 0.5  db ) @xcite .",
    "thus , common e - field probes in use today have many shortcomings : they are not very sensitive , may perturb the field during the measurements , may be relatively large , and require a calibration .",
    "the calibration procedure relies on a field value that is known to within only 5  @xmath4 .",
    "one promising approach to remedy these problems is by using an e - field probe based on room - temperature rydberg atoms . in this technique ,",
    "alkali atoms placed in a vapor cell ( a glass cell with atomic vapor inside , see fig .",
    "[ vaporcell](a ) ) are excited optically to rydberg states and the applied radio frequency ( rf ) field alters the resonant state of the atoms .",
    "( throughout this paper , the term `` rf '' is used to cover the conventional rf , microwave , millimeter wave , and sub - terahertz frequency ranges . )",
    "this approach exploits the sensitivity of the high - lying rydberg states to rf radiation .",
    "this sensitivity is reflected by the large transition matrix elements ( @xmath5 , on the order of @xmath6 to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the electric charge and @xmath9 is the bohr radius ) for rf transitions between rydberg states .",
    "we measure an autler - townes splitting @xcite of rydberg energy levels in these atoms due the applied rf field .",
    "this splitting is easily measured with electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite-@xcite and is directly related to the applied e - field strength , planck s constant @xmath10 , and @xmath5 .",
    "a measurement of the splitting gives a measure of the field strength .",
    "the high accuracy in this approach is because the eit technique reduces an amplitude measurement ( the desired quantity ) to a frequency measurement ( a measurement that can be performed very accurately ) .",
    "it is possible to excite the atom to a wide range of atomic states ( a state that can interact with the applied rf e - field ) .",
    "as such , with one vapor cell , accurate measurements of a rf e - field strength over a frequency range from 1  ghz to 500  ghz are possible .",
    "there is a push from various international metrology laboratories ( including the national institute for standards and technology , nist ) to make all measurements traceable to si - units and/or traceable to fundamental physical constants . while , a large number of various measurements are si traceable , to date , all methods to make an e - field measurement that is si traceable requires a complex traceability path .",
    "the technique discussed in this paper provides a much more direct traceability path .",
    "this new approach for e - field measurements has the following benefits : ( 1 ) it yields the field strength in si units from a frequency measurement , fundamental constants , and known atomic parameters , ( 2 ) it is self - calibrating due to the invariance of the atomic parameters , ( 3 ) it will provide rf e - field measurements independent of current techniques , ( 4 ) since no metal is present in the probe , the probe will cause minimal perturbation of the field during the measurement , ( 5 ) it will measure both very weak and very strong fields over a large range of frequencies ( field strengths as low as 0.8  mv / m have been measured , and below 0.01  mv / m may be possible @xcite ) , and ( 6 ) it allow for the construction of small , compact probes ( optical fiber and chip - scale probes ) .",
    "possible applications for this probe are numerous , ranging from biomedical to sub - wavelength imaging .",
    "atomic measurement standards have been used for a number of years for a wide array of measurements , most notable are time , frequency , and length .",
    "however there are just a few publications on the use of the atom for @xmath0-field measurements @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there is also work on the measurement of dc @xmath0-fields @xcite-@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will present the underlying physics of the eit technique in a manner familiar to the em community and demonstrate how it can be used in the development of a broadband probe covering a frequency range of 1  ghz to 500  ghz .",
    "we will also present calculations of the required @xmath5 for a specific set of atomic states for a range of rf transitions which are needed to determine the e - field from this measured splitting .",
    "the technique is validated by the agreement of experimental data with both numerical simulations and far - field calculations for various frequencies .",
    "we discuss the uncertainties in this approach and discuss various current and potential applications .",
    "in this section we present the basic concept of the measurement approach , which uses a vapor of alkali atoms , contained in a cell ( see fig .  [ vaporcell ] ) , as the active medium of the probe .",
    "we choose atomic species that have a sufficiently high vapor pressure at room temperature . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on rubidium-85 ( @xmath11rb ) atoms , but other alkali atoms could be used .",
    "a diagram of the measurement setup with the @xmath11rb vapor cell is shown in fig .",
    "[ vaporcell](b ) .",
    "+    the relevant atomic states for this approach are in the four - level atomic system depicted in fig .",
    "[ 4level ] .",
    "when the frequency of the light ( probe laser ) matches the @xmath12 to @xmath13 atomic resonance ( using @xmath11rb for our application , this corresponds to a 780  nm or `` red '' laser ) , the atoms scatter light from the incident beam and reduce the transmitted light intensity measured on the detector .",
    "if a second strong (  coupling \" ) light field is applied resonant with the @xmath13 to @xmath14 transition ( using @xmath11rb for our application , this corresponds to a 480  nm or `` blue '' laser ) , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 states are mixed to form dressed state pairs which are close in energy .",
    "the excitation amplitudes from @xmath12 to each of these two dressed states then have opposite signs , leading to destructive quantum interference of these excitation pathways . as such",
    ", a transparency window is opened for the probe ( `` red '' ) light : probe light transmission is increased .",
    "this is the phenomenon known as eit @xcite .",
    "if the atomic states @xmath14 and @xmath15 are chosen appropriately , an applied rf field will couple states @xmath14 and @xmath15 . a third dressed state is then introduced between the two involved in eit which leads to constructive interference in the probe absorption .",
    "this splits the eit resonance in two , and for resonant driving fields the new transmission maxima are split by the rabi frequency @xmath16 ( defined in detail below ) of the @xmath14-@xmath15 transition @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is known as autler - townes splitting @xcite of the eit signal , which is related to the applied field and allows for a measurement of the e - field strength .",
    "in order to measure the field strength ( or amplitude ) for different frequencies , different states @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be chosen .",
    "state @xmath14 is selected by tuning the wavelength of the coupling laser , and the @xmath15 state is selected via the rf source . in doing this ,",
    "a large range of atomic transitions can be selected , allowing measurements of rf fields over a correspondingly wide selection of frequencies .",
    "in essence , the atoms act as highly - tunable , resonant , frequency selective rf detectors .",
    "this is a significant benefit of using rydberg atoms as field probes .",
    "the wide range of states @xmath14 selectable by the coupling laser , translates to the broadband nature of the probe , which allows rf measurements ranging from 1  ghz to 500  ghz .",
    "there are various ways to analytically describe and model this technique .",
    "one convenient approach from an em perspective is to model the atoms in the vapor cell as an effective medium in which the effective permittivity of the medium for the probe laser propagating through the cell is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the susceptibility of the medium for the probe laser . using the results in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the susceptibility is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 is the atom density in the cell , and the subscripts 12 , 13 , and 14 , correspond to the transitions of from the `` i '' to `` 1 '' state ( i.e. , @xmath22 to @xmath12 , see the labels in fig .",
    "[ 4level ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is the decay rate for the various states ( where `` i '' is 2 - 4 , ) , @xmath24 is the de - tuning of the probe laser ( defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the on - resonance angular frequency of states @xmath12 to @xmath13 and @xmath27 is the angular frequency of the probe laser ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath28 are the rabi frequencies for the different transitions and are given by @xmath29 where @xmath10 is planck s constant , @xmath30 are the e - field of the probe laser , the coupling laser , and the rf source , respectively . finally , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the atomic dipole moments corresponding to the probe , coupling , and rf transitions",
    ". we should add that in general , the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 would also be a function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( the de - tuning of the coupling laser and rf source ) , see @xcite .",
    "here , we take the coupling laser frequency and rf to be resonant with their respective transitions ( or @xmath38 ) and only consider a detuning of the probe from the @xmath12 to @xmath13 transition .    using this susceptibility ,",
    "the magnitude of the transmission coefficient ( @xmath39 ) of the probe laser propagating through the cell can be approximated by the following @xcite : @xmath40}{2\\lambda_p}\\right)\\,\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the length of the cell and @xmath42 is the wavelength of the probe laser .",

    "we use this model to understand the behavior of the eit signal on the detector as a function of the applied rf field strength ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) .",

    "we consider this type of measurement of the e - field strength a direct si traceable measurement in that it is related to planck s constant . by using the interaction of atoms in a vapor cell with two applied lasers and a rf field , it is possible to reduce an rf e - field amplitude measurement to a frequency measurement ( or simply measuring the frequency difference in the splitting of an eit signal ) .",
    "as a side note , the eit technique has interesting possibilities from a metamaterials viewpoint .",
    "there is a great deal of attention in the metamaterial community on developing tunable materials that can be used for slow - wave and near - zero permittivity materials , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this eit technique can in principle be used to tailor the real part of effective permittivity at the probe - laser wavelength via an rf source , i.e. , for a given probe laser wavelength , an applied rf field can be used to obtain a desired value for @xmath60 ( e.g. , @xmath61<1 $ ] ) .",
    "this will be investigated in more detail in future publications .",
    "a conventional dipole antenna is tuned or optimized to a particular frequency by its physical size ( or dipole length ) .",
    "this atom - based probe is somewhat analogous to the dipole antenna , in that , instead of varying a length dimension ( the dipole length ) we simply vary the wavelength of the coupling light to measure a desired rf transition .",

    "once again good agreement is demonstrated between the measured and far - field calculations .    the results in fig .",
    "[ splot ] show an interesting point . from this figure",
    "we see that as the field strength is increased , the separation in the splitting not only increases , but equally important , we see that the heights of the two peaks get smaller and become comparable to the back ground noise signal . here lies a potential problem . if the field strength becomes too large , the peaks may be difficult to determine and hence it could be hard to accurately measure these large field strengths .",
    "we are currently looking at methods that will allow the measurement of very high field strengths that will overcome this issue .",
    "one approach that has shown promise , is to use the concept of rf `` two - photon '' transitions , see @xcite for details .    in this section ,",
    "we have shown experimental data for the measurement of @xmath0-field strengths for a wide range of frequencies , and we have shown very good agreement between these measured field strengths to both numerical simulations and far - field calculations .",
    "the results in this section illustrate the broadband nature of this type of measurement technique .",
    "the uncertainties in this type of measurement are still being investigated in detail , but we can comment on some of the aspects . in general , the uncertainties can be grouped into two different categories : ( a ) quantum based uncertainties ( i.e. , parameters and issues related to the atomic physics aspect of the technique ) , and ( b ) rf based uncertainties ( i.e. , parameters and issues related to the rf aspect of the technique ) . some of the various quantum based uncertainties have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "as seen from ( [ mage2 ] ) , the one calculable parameter needed in this technique is the atomic dipole moment ( @xmath33 ) . using the best available quantum defect ( @xcite and @xcite ) to perform a numerical calculation of @xmath33 ( see discussion in section [ dipolesec ] )",
    "it is believed that @xmath33 can be determined to less than @xmath114 .    we and other groups are currently looking at methods to obtain more accurate values for @xmath33 . with this",
    "said , it is believed that the largest source of measurement uncertainties in this technique is the rf based uncertainty .",
    "this type of uncertainty results from the fact that since we are using a glass ( or dielectric ) cell to hold the atoms , the rf field interacts with the cell itself . when an rf wave is incident onto a hollow glass cell",
    ", standing waves can develop on the inside of the cell due to the internal reflection inside the cell .",
    "the distribution of the e - fields inside the cell will vary depending on the frequency and on the size of the cell .",
    "this may result in the field inside the cell being different than the incident field ( the desired measured quantity ) .",
    "it is unclear how large of an effect this is , and we are currently investigating this issue . with that noted , this perturbation can be reduced by making the cell as small as possible . if this perturbation is not reduced entirely , it can be calculated and accounted for .",
    "we have recently manufactured cells on the order of 2  mm and smaller in size ( see next section ) , and future work will be looking at these cell - size efforts on field perturbation .",
    "the obvious applications of the type of technique include : ( 1 ) a direct si unit link rf @xmath0-field measurement , ( 2 ) the technique will be self calibrating : traced to atomic transitions , ( 3 ) the technique will provide an rf measurement independent of current techniques , ( 4 ) the technique will measure both very weak and very strong fields over a large range of frequencies ( @xmath630.1  mv / m : two to three orders of magnitude improvement over current approaches ; and @xmath1150.01  mv / m may be possible ) , and ( 5 ) the probe / sensor can be used as a stand alone measurement or it can be used to calibrate existing probes and/or test facilities .    beside the obvious applications , the technique can open up numerous other applications . some of the other interesting applications include : ( 1 ) having a truly broadband probe : covering 1  ghz to 500  ghz , ( 2 ) the possibility of a compact in vitro / vivo measurement , e.g. , specific absorption rate ( sar ) probe , ( 3 ) bio - sensing and bio - imaging on a compact scale , ( 3 ) imaging sensors and arrays of small vapor cells , ( 4 ) the abilities of field measurements in small confined spaces , ( 5 ) millimeter wave and sub - terahertz wave traceable calibrations ( not currently possible ) @xcite , and ( 6 ) the possibility of measurements on a small spatial scale , i.e. , sub - wavelength imaging and field mapping over a large frequency range .",
    "most notable of these listed applications are the sensitivity capability , the compact nature , and sub - wavelength imaging aspects of the technique .",
    "while in the experimental examples shown here , we use a cell on the order of 25  mm to 75  mm , the vapor cell can be made smaller and hence allow a compact probe ( or sensor head ) .",
    "we are currently investigating this aspect , where in we are performing experiments on 2  mm and 4  mm cubic cells , see fig .  [",
    "4mmcell](a ) .",
    "while this work will be reported in detail later , fig .  [ 4mmcell](b ) shows initial data taken with the 4  mm cell .",
    "the data show that for this small cell , the desired linear behavior is observed .",
    "our eventual goal in this work is to use a hollow - core photonic bandgap fiber as a vapor cell ( see fig .",
    "[ fiber ] ) , resulting in a probe with a spatial size on the order 100 s  @xmath82 m and smaller .",
    "we are currently investigating such a fiber .",
    "regardless of the size of the vapor cell , this technique allows for sub - wavelength imaging of an rf field over a large frequency range .",
    "this has been demonstrated in @xcite where field distributions inside a glass cell were imaged at both 17.04  ghz and 104.77  ghz .",
    "the unique feature of this imaging approach is that the spatial resolution is not governed by the size of the vapor cell that holds the atoms . in fact , the spatial resolution is governed by the width of the laser beams used .",
    "the rf field will only interact with the atoms that are exposed to the two laser beams .",
    "as such , the spatial resolution of this approach is based on beam widths of the two lasers used in this experiment , which can be in principle on the order of the diffraction limit , i.e. , 10 s  @xmath82 m .",
    "the applications of such a small spatial imaging capability are numerous .",
    "for example , the sensing volume could be scanned over a printed - circuit - board ( pcb ) or a metasurface @xcite in order to map their fields , as well as other applications where e - field measurements on a small spatial resolution are desired .",
    "we have presented the framework for a technique using rydberg atoms place in a vapor cell for measuring @xmath0-field strengths at rf .",
    "the benefit of using atoms allows us to convert an amplitude measurement of the rf field strength to a frequency measurement of an optical signal , giving both an accurate and sensitive @xmath0-field strength measurement .",
    "we have demonstrated that this is a `` truly '' broadband technique .",
    "that is , with two tunable lasers and one vapor cell , it is possible to measure rf field strengths over a frequency range of 1  ghz to 500  ghz .",
    "we have validated this technique by comparing experimental data to both numerical simulations and to far - field calculations for various frequencies from 15  ghz to 105  ghz .",
    "this technique has the capability of performing a direct traceable si measurement that does not need to be calibrated , has drastically improved sensitivity , and can be very compact ( @xmath1151  mm ) . besides the obvious uses , the probe can have numerous new applications .",
    "most notably are the sensitivity and sub - wavelength measurement aspects . from a sensitivity viewpoint , at least two to three orders of magnitude improvement over current techniques are attainable and field strength measurements of @xmath1150.01  mv / m may be possible .",
    "this technique can also be used to perform sub - wavelength imaging and field mapping over a large range of frequencies @xcite .",
    "the e - field imaging volume is determined by the overlap of the rf , the probe beam , and coupling beam within the vapor cell , and as such the high spatial resolution is based on the two lasers beam widths , which can be on the order of 50  @xmath82 m to 100  @xmath82 m ( and possibly smaller ) . in future publications",
    "we will address a detailed uncertainty analysis , present various imaging measurements and applications , as well as discuss the scaling down of the technique in order to make a compact field probe / sensor .",
