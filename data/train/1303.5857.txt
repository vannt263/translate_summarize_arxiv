    "networks are the simplest representation of complex systems of interacting parts",
    ". examples of these are ubiquitous in practice , including large social networks  @xcite , information systems  @xcite and cooperate ownerships  @xcite , to name just a few . despite a seemingly plain form , real - world networks reveal characteristic structural properties that are absent from regular or random systems  @xcite .",
    "thus , networked systems are believed to be controlled by common phenomena .",
    "scale - free degree distributions  @xcite , small - world phenomena  @xcite , degree mixing  @xcite ( i.e. , degree correlations at links ends ) and existence of communities  @xcite ( i.e. , densely linked groups of nodes ) are perhaps among most widely analyzed properties of large real - world networks . note that community structure implies assortative ( i.e , positively correlated ) mixing by degree  @xcite , which can be seen as a tendency of hubs ( i.e. , highly linked nodes ) to cluster together .",
    "the above are also the properties captured by many random graph models proposed in the literature  @xcite .    however , most ( non - social ) networks deviate from this figure .",
    "biological and technological networks are in fact degree disassortative ( i.e. , negatively correlated ) , while different information networks often reveal no clear degree mixing  @xcite ( see  figure  [ fig : cora ] ) .",
    "thus , we here propose an evolving random graph model based on the link copying mechanism  @xcite .",
    "each newly added node explores the network using the burning process in  @xcite , while links of the visited nodes are copied independently of the latter .",
    "the model generates scale - free small - world networks with community structure and also degree disassortativity .",
    "furthermore , it has a natural interpretation for citation networks .",
    "the above process imitates an author of a paper including references into the bibliography ( i.e. , its citation dynamics ) , which enables different practical applications in bibliometrics ( see  section  [ sec : cora ] ) .",
    "data mining part of _ cora_citation network  @xcite with highlighted hubs ( i.e. , @xmath0 of most highly linked nodes ) that are scattered across the network .",
    "( node sizes are proportional to degrees . ) ]    the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] introduces the proposed ( citation ) model , while a thorough analysis is given in section  [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "let a network be represented by a simple graph @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the set of nodes , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the set of links , @xmath5 .",
    "next , let @xmath6 be the set of neighbors of node @xmath7 and let @xmath8 be its degree , @xmath9 .",
    "last , let @xmath10 be the mean degree and @xmath11 the mean neighbor degree .    proposed graph model is based on the burning process of forest firemodel  @xcite , which we introduce first .",
    "due to simplicity , the model is presented for undirected networks .",
    "let @xmath12 be the burning probability , @xmath13 ( see below ) .",
    "initially , the network consists of a single node , while for each newly added node @xmath14 , the burning process proceeds as follows .    1 .",
    "@xmath14 chooses an ambassador @xmath15 uniformly at random ( we say that @xmath14 burns @xmath16 ) and links to it .",
    "@xmath14 randomly selects ( at most ) @xmath17 neighbors of @xmath16 that were not yet burned @xmath18 and links to them .",
    "( @xmath17 is sampled from a geometric distribution with mean @xmath19 . )",
    "@xmath20 are taken as the ambassadors of @xmath14 ( step  ( 2 ) ) .",
    "since each node can be visited at most once , the burning process surely converges .",
    "thus , to generate a network with @xmath21 nodes , the model repeats the above procedure @xmath22 times .",
    "forest firemodel produces shrinking diameters and densification phenomena observed in temporal networks  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , generated networks are scale - free and small - world , and reveal a pronounced community structure . however , in contrast to many real - world networks , the model gives degree assortative networks ( see  section  [ sec : experiments ] ) .",
    "the model also has a natural interpretation for citation networks .",
    "burning process imitates an author of a paper including references into the bibliography ( i.e. , citation dynamics ) .",
    "author first reads a related paper , or selects the paper that triggered the research , and cites it ( step  ( 1 ) ) .",
    "author then considers its bibliography for other related papers ( step  ( 2 ) ) .",
    "some of these are further considered and also cited , while the author continues as before ( step  ( 3 ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , forest fire  model fails to reproduce some of the properties of citation networks ( e.g. , degree mixing ) .",
    "note that the described process assumes that authors read , or at least consider , all the papers they cite .",
    "however , this is indeed not the case  @xcite .",
    "for example , seminal work on random graphs conducted by erds and rnyi  @xcite is perhaps among most widely cited papers in network science literature .",
    "although , presumably , only a smaller number of authors have actually read the original paper . as the work is widely discussed elsewhere , most authors have just copied the reference from another paper . on the other hand , authors also do not cite all the papers they read , though related to their work .",
    "this can be simply due to space limitations .",
    "nevertheless , a paper can still be read thoroughly , with many of its references further considered and cited .",
    "examples suggest that the papers that authors read or cite are selected due to two , not necessarily dependent , processes .",
    "we thus propose a citationmodel that adopts the above burning procedure to traverse the network , while the links are formed according to another independent process .",
    "let @xmath23 be the linking probability , @xmath24 ( see below ) .",
    "initially , the network consists of a single link , while for each newly added node @xmath14 , the model proceeds as follows .    1 .",
    "@xmath14 chooses an ambassador @xmath15 uniformly at random .",
    "@xmath14 randomly selects ( at most ) @xmath17 neighbors of @xmath16 that were not yet burned @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath14 randomly selects ( at most ) @xmath25 neighbors of @xmath16 that were not yet linked @xmath26 and links to them .",
    "4 .   @xmath20 are taken as the ambassadors of @xmath14 ( step  ( 2 ) ) .",
    "details are the same as before .",
    "again , the process surely converges , while the entire procedure is repeated @xmath27  times .",
    "let @xmath28 be the mean number of burned nodes ( i.e. , ambassadors ) .",
    "a node selects @xmath19 ambassadors on each step , thus , @xmath29    a node will fail to form any link ( i.e. , become isolated ) with probability @xmath30 . although isolated nodes are a common property of real - world networks , they are often ignored in practice or the network is even reduced to the largest connected component .",
    "thus , for the analysis here , we repeat the procedure until the largest component has @xmath21 nodes .",
    "since a node forms @xmath31 links on each step , expected network degree is ( with @xmath32 correction for isolated  nodes ) @xmath33    although equations  ( [ equ : burned ] ) and  ( [ equ : degree ] ) are only valid in the limit of large network size , the bounds are rather tight for large enough @xmath21 ( see  figure  [ fig : analysis ] ) .",
    "thus , given network degree @xmath10 and fixed @xmath34 , one can solve the system for @xmath12 , which can be used for parameter estimation in practice ( see  section  [ sec : cora ] ) .",
    "citation  model generates small - world networks with scale - free degree distribution and community structure ( see  section  [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to forest firemodel , resulting networks are degree disassortative .",
    "we stress that the key factor here is that newly added nodes do not ( necessarily ) link to their ambassadors , which in fact produces degree assortativity .",
    "since a node copies the links of its ambassadors , linking to them obviously promotes assortativity .",
    "however , in the absence of an explicit process introducing assortativity , ( scale - free ) networks are expected to be degree disassortative  @xcite .",
    "the analysis in  section  [ sec : experiments ] thus also includes a variant of forest firemodel denoted butterflymodel , where a node links to its ambassadors only with probability @xmath34 ( considered in  @xcite ) , as well as a variant of the proposed citationmodel denoted copyingmodel , where a node links to each ambassador  @xcite ( for details see figure  [ fig : models ] ) .",
    "other authors have proposed models very similar to ours  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these either do not adopt the burning process to traverse the network or the model necessarily links the nodes to their ambassadors , which results in degree assortativity .",
    "more precisely , the set of the linked nodes is always a subset of the nodes burned ( or vice versa ) .",
    "however , in the case of citationmodel , these two sets can intersect arbitrarily , while they can also be disjoint .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis ] conducts an empirical analysis of citationmodel and several alternatives proposed in the literature ( see  section  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "next , networks constructed with different models are compared against a larger citation network ( section  [ sec : cora ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison ] shows basic statistics of the networks generated with different graph models for parameters @xmath12 and @xmath34 shown ( see  section  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "most notably , only the proposed citationmodel gives degree disassortative networks measured by the mixing coefficient @xmath35 $ ]  @xcite ( see  figures  [ fig : comparison : p : r ] and  [ fig : comparison : q : r ] ) .",
    "@xmath36 is simply a pearson correlation coefficient of degrees at links ends .",
    "thus , @xmath37 for citationmodel , while @xmath38 for forest fireand butterflymodels .",
    "observe that copyingmodel also generates networks with @xmath39 for very large @xmath12 and @xmath34 , however , these are much denser than comparable real - world networks ( see  figures  [ fig : comparison : p : k ] and  [ fig : comparison : q : k ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , all models give small - world networks with short mean distance between the nodes @xmath40  @xcite ( see  figures  [ fig : comparison : p : l ] and  [ fig : comparison : q : l ] ) and high transitivity measured by the clustering coefficient @xmath41 $ ]  @xcite ( see  figures  [ fig : comparison : p : c ] and  [ fig : comparison : q : c ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath42 increases with @xmath12 , while @xmath34 has little effect on @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , all models generate networks with clear community structure according to modularity @xmath43 $ ]  @xcite , where @xmath44 is estimated using a fast multi - stage optimization  @xcite ( see  figures  [ fig : comparison : p : q ] and  [ fig : comparison : q : q ] ) . although @xmath44 decreases with increasing @xmath12 or @xmath34 in the case of citationand copyingmodels , the values are somewhat comparable to those observed in real - world networks .",
    "forest fireand butterflymodels , however , appear to overestimate @xmath44 for selected @xmath12 and @xmath34 .",
    "networks constructed with citationmodel also reveal scale - free degree distributions  @xcite ( see  figure  [ fig : cora : pk ] ) , thus , the model generates most common properties of real - world networks .",
    "cccccc model & @xmath12 & @xmath34 & @xmath45 & @xmath10 & @xmath36 + forest fire & @xmath46 & - & @xmath47 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 + citation & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 + _ cora _ & & & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 +      due to a natural interpretation for citation networks ( see section  [ sec : model ] ) , the proposed model has different practical applications in bibliometrics .",
    "we here analyze author citation dynamics based on the famous _",
    "cora_dataset  @xcite that contains computer science papers collected from the web , and also the references automatically parsed from the bibliographies of the papers .",
    "we extract a citation network with @xmath58 , while other statistics are reported in  table  [ tbl : cora ] .",
    "table  [ tbl : cora ] also includes the networks generated with citationand forest firemodels , where parameters @xmath12 and @xmath34 were estimated as described in  section  [ sec : model ] . note that citationmodel well matches the disassortative mixing regime in _ cora_citation network (",
    "observe also a similar trend in  figure  [ fig : cora : kn ] ) , while forest firemodel gives degree assortative networks .",
    "( for comparison based on other network properties see  @xcite . )    recall that @xmath28 in equation  ( [ equ : burned ] ) can be seen as the number references actually read by an author of some paper .",
    "thus , the fraction of papers considered by the authors , relative to the number of all papers cited , can be estimated to @xmath59 .",
    "the value is much larger than expected  @xcite , however , the results are largely influenced by an automatic sampling procedure  @xcite ( i.e. , on average , only @xmath60 references of each paper are also included in the network ) .",
    "the paper proposes a simple graph model that generates networks with most common properties of real - world networks and , in contrast to many other models , dissasortative degree mixing .",
    "the model also has a natural interpretation for citation networks with different practical applications .    due to simplicity",
    ", the analysis in the paper is based on undirected networks .",
    "however , this presents a serious limitation , especially for citation networks considered here .",
