    "in this paper we address the question of the possibility of extending the definition of some @xmath5-invariants , like the l@xmath4-betti numbers and novikov - shubin numbers , to geometric structures which are not coverings of compact spaces .",
    "the first attempt in this sense is due to john roe @xcite , who defined a trace on finite propagation operators on amenable manifolds , allowing the definition of l@xmath4-betti numbers on these spaces .",
    "however such trace was defined in terms of a suitable generalised limit , hence the corresponding l@xmath4-betti and novikov - shubin numbers also depend on this generalised limit procedure .    here",
    "we show that , on spaces possessing a suitable self - similarity , it is possible to select a natural c@xmath0-algebra of operators , generated by operators with finite propagation and locally commuting with the transformations giving the self - similar structure , on which a roe - type trace is well defined .",
    "the theory of @xmath5-invariants was started by atiyah , who , in a celebrated paper @xcite , observed that on covering manifolds @xmath6 , a trace on @xmath7-periodic operators may be defined , called @xmath7-trace , with respect to which the laplace operator has compact resolvent . replacing the usual trace with the @xmath7-trace",
    ", he defined the @xmath8-betti numbers and proved an index theorem for covering manifolds .    based on this paper , novikov and shubin",
    "@xcite observed that , since for noncompact manifolds the spectrum of the laplacian is not discrete , new global spectral invariants can be defined , which necessarily involve the density near zero of the spectrum .",
    "l@xmath9-betti numbers were proved to be @xmath10-homotopy invariants by dodziuk @xcite , whereas novikov - shubin numbers were proved to be @xmath10-homotopy invariants by gromov - shubin @xcite .",
    "l@xmath9-betti numbers ( depending on a generalised limit procedure ) were subsequently defined for open manifolds by roe , and were proved to be invariant under quasi - isometries @xcite .",
    "the invariance of novikov - shubin numbers was proved in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the present analysis is the notion of self - similar cw - complex , which is defined as a complex endowed with a natural exhaustion @xmath11 in such a way that @xmath12 is a union ( with small intersections ) of a finite number of copies of @xmath13 .",
    "the identification of the different copies of @xmath13 in @xmath12 gives rise to many local isomorphisms on such complexes .",
    "then we consider finite propagation operators commuting with these local isomorphisms up to boundary terms , and call them geometric operators .",
    "geometric operators generate a c@xmath0-algebra @xmath14 on the space of @xmath15-chains of @xmath2-cells , for any @xmath2 from zero to the dimension of the complex , containing the @xmath2-laplace operator . for any operator @xmath16 in this c@xmath0-algebra",
    ", we consider the sequence of the traces of @xmath17 , renormalised with the volume of the @xmath2-cells of @xmath13 , where @xmath18 denotes the projection onto the space generated by the @xmath2-cells of @xmath13 .",
    "such a sequence is convergent , and the corresponding functional is indeed a finite trace on @xmath14 . by means of these traces , l@xmath4-betti numbers and novikov - shubin numbers are defined . for the sake of completeness , we mention that notions related to that of geometric operators have been considered in the literature , see @xmath19 @xcite where they are called tight binding operators , and @xcite where they are called pattern invariant operators .    in the @xmath7-covering case ,",
    "@xmath5-betti numbers are defined as @xmath7-dimensions of the kernels of laplace operators , namely as @xmath7-traces of the corresponding projections .",
    "this is not allowed in our framework . indeed ,",
    "our traces being finite , and the c@xmath0-algebras being weakly dense in the algebra of all bounded linear operators , our traces can not extend to the generated von neumann algebras .",
    "in particular they are not defined on the spectral projections of the laplace operators .",
    "therefore we define l@xmath4-betti numbers as the infimum of the traces of all continuous functional calculi of the laplacian , with functions taking value 1 at 0 , namely l@xmath4-betti numbers are defined as the `` external measure '' of the spectral projections of the laplace operators .",
    "since we are in an infinite setting , the euler - poincar characteristic is naturally defined as a renormalised limit of the euler - poincar characteristic of the truncations @xmath13 of the complex .",
    "we prove that such characteristic coincides with the alternating sum of the l@xmath4-betti numbers .",
    "an analogous result , though obtained with a different proof , for amenable simplicial complexes is contained @xcite .    here we do not prove directly invariance results for l@xmath4-betti or novikov - shubin numbers , however when 1-dimensional cw - complexes are considered , and in particular prefractal graphs determined by nested fractals , a result by hambly and kumagai applies @xcite , implying that novikov - shubin numbers are invariant under rough isometries .",
    "further results on invariance will be proved elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we then show that in some cases l@xmath4-betti and novikov - shubin numbers can be computed , relying on results of several authors concerning random walks on graphs .",
    "in particular , it turns out that the novikov - shubin numbers of some prefractal complexes coincide with the spectral dimensions of the corresponding fractals , thus strenghtening the interpretation of such numbers as ( asymptotic ) spectral dimensions given in @xcite .",
    "our framework was strongly influenced by the approach of lott and lck @xcite , in particular we also consider invariants relative to the boundary , however we are not able to prove the poincar duality shown in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall some notions from the theory of cw - complexes and introduce the basic operators .",
    "section 3 introduces the notion of local isomorphisms of cw - complexes and the algebra of geometric operators . the notion of self - similar cw - complex",
    "is given in section 4 , and a finite trace on geometric operators is constructed .",
    "in section 5 we introduce l@xmath9-betti and novikov - shubin numbers for the above setting , and prove the mentioned result on the euler - poincar characteristic .",
    "section 6 focuses on the subclass of self - similar cw - complexes given by prefractal complexes , and on some properties of the associated laplacians .",
    "computations of the novikov - shubin numbers for fractal graphs in terms of transition probabilities , together with an invariance result under rough isometries are discussed in sections 7 and 8 , and the top - dimensional relative novikov - shubin number is computed for two examples of 2-dimensional cw - complexes .    in closing this introduction , we note that the c@xmath20-algebra and the trace for self - similar graphs constructed in this paper , are used in @xcite to study the ihara zeta function for fractal graphs .",
    "the results contained in this paper were announced in the conferences `` c@xmath0-algebras and elliptic theory '' bedlewo 2006 , and `` 21@xmath21 international conference on operator theory '' timisoara 2006 .",
    "in this paper we shall consider a particular class of infinite cw - complexes , therefore we start by recalling some notions from algebraic topology , general references being @xcite .",
