    "the study of extended sources in gravitational theories has a rich literature behind it .",
    "a full understanding of the spectrum is necessary , among other things , to attain a consistent partition function .",
    "a notable example of this assertion is the case of anti - de sitter ( ads ) gravity in three dimensions with negative cosmological constant , whose spectrum contains btz black holes @xcite and conical defects ( well - behaved naked singularities that admit the interpretation of point particles ) @xcite , but no propagating gravitons .",
    "still , the euclidean path integral with only smooth manifold contributions does not lead to a sensible quantum gravity partition function ; seemingly , there may be additional contributions that require the introduction of point - like sources @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the class of configurations we aim to explore in the present article .",
    "any configuration in three - dimensional ads gravity that has constant curvature arises from identifications of ads space by a discrete one - parameter subgroup of @xmath0 generated by a killing vector @xcite .",
    "the construction of black holes by identifications in ads space can be extended to higher dimensions . if the identifications do not have fixed points , they produce _ topological _ ads black holes .",
    "they have been constructed , for instance , in @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite , and higher dimensions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the identifications do have fixed points , they produce cone - like singularities whose consistent interpretation demands the introduction of explicit source terms in the lagrangian , localized at their singular _",
    "loci_. even in a three - dimensional theory , these singularities correspond to topological defects at the positions of external current insertions that couple in a gauge - invariant way to three - dimensional ads gravity .",
    "the angular deficit at the singularities account for the negative part of the btz mass spectrum @xcite , filling the gap between the vacuum and the massless btz black hole .",
    "it may seem surprising that those identifications leading to cone - like or dirac delta function singularities are particularly interesting .",
    "they describe codimension - two branes in gravity theories in any dimension and , in particular , 0-branes in three dimensions . by construction , these are locally constant curvature geometries except at isolated codimension - two hypersurfaces whose presence modify the topology of loops and closed surfaces in the ambient spacetime . in all cases ,",
    "the codimension - two branes represent localized sources not covered by event horizons .",
    "since these configurations are built from geometrical considerations that do not rely on dynamics , they might a priori arise in many different theories .",
    "nonetheless , they can be naturally accommodated within a suitable framework where they become extended sources for gauge theories of gravity , such as chern - simons ( cs ) theories @xcite .",
    "the nature of the conserved charges , as well as the stability of these branes , do depend on the action , since the fluctuations of geometry around the solutions depend on the full set of field equations . in order to study the stability of the spinning branes , we consider cs ads supergravity actions @xcite . as we will discuss in this article ,",
    "the framework is possibly broader than this , though the only explicit realizations we have considered here are cs theories of ( super)gravity @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these gravitation theories is that they are _ gauge _ theories of gravity and that the interaction between the external sources ( @xmath3-branes ) and the gauge connection can be incorporated in the action in a background - independent , metric - free and gauge invariant way @xcite .",
    "this coupling between branes and non - abelian gauge connections generalizes the minimal coupling that describes the interaction between a point charge ( 0-brane ) and the @xmath4 gauge connection @xcite . besides",
    ", these theories have many amenable features such as an off - shell formulation with the symmetries dictated by the m - algebra @xcite .",
    "to be more concrete , the kind of gravitational theories under consideration in the present paper are those that can be written in terms of a gauge connection .",
    "we will use the first order formalism , in which the gravitational fields are the vielbein 1-form , @xmath5 , and the spin - connection 1-form , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "they can be written altogether as components of the ads gauge connection @xmath8 with the ads generators @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 .",
    "the riemann curvature 2-form , @xmath12 , and the torsion 2-form , @xmath13 , are the components of the ads curvature ( field - strength ) , @xmath14 the flat connection , @xmath15 , corresponds to a torsion - free , global ads@xmath16 spacetime .",
    "we are interested in configurations defined on a @xmath17-dimensional manifold @xmath18 described by the equation @xmath19 where the sources @xmath20 are localized at codimension - two surfaces embedded in the @xmath17-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the 2-form currents must be covariantly conserved , @xmath21 , and they represent ( @xmath22)-branes sweeping codimension - two histories . since @xmath23 vanishes almost everywhere , except on some submanifold of measure zero , these branes produce locally ads spacetimes , that could be solutions of any gravitation theory with negative cosmological constant that admits global ads solutions . apart from cs ads gravity , these include standard einstein - hilbert ads gravity , or higher - dimensional generalization of general relativity described by lovelock gravities @xcite .",
    "a similar procedure was employed to obtain locally flat geometries by identifications of minkowski space in the framework of einstein - hilbert gravity , leading to stationary , axisymmetric solutions with sources in the form of rods along a line @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above , in some gravities it might be difficult to identify a coupling in the action whose field equations possess @xmath24 as a particular solution . in @xmath25 dimensions , there is at least one gauge - invariant coupling that gives rise to this kind of interaction with a codimension - two source , @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is a coupling constant , @xmath28 is the trace taken in the algebra of some gauge group that contains ads and @xmath29 is the chern - simons form that satisfies @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the wedge product of @xmath32 field - strength 2-forms .",
    "this coupling can be added , for example , to ( @xmath33)-dimensional cs ads gravity , @xmath34 the resulting field equations , @xmath35 , have @xmath24 as a particular solution .    for the sake of concreteness , whenever we need to specify an action ( for example , in order to study the stability of the solution ) , we shall focus to cs ads gravity @xmath36=i_{\\text{cs}}+i_{\\text{int}}$ ] , coupled to the sources in the form ( [ interaction ] ) .",
    "in this section we consider three - dimensional ads space and show how a spinning @xmath37-brane can be obtained from identifications in this space .",
    "the construction is analogous to the one that yields the spinning black hole in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "this method was employed to construct the static 0-brane ( point particle ) in 3 dimensions @xcite , yielding particle solutions whose mass spectrum extends the black hole mass parameter to negative values .",
    "the procedure of boosting the static @xmath37-brane , along the lines of @xcite , provides a natural physical interpretation of the parameters that enter in the construction of the spinning branes .",
    "let us start by reviewing the construction of the static @xmath37-brane .",

    "the metric , with this identification , reads @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "compared with the btz black hole , the parameter @xmath55 is seen to play the role of the ( negative ) mass . the spacetime geometry given by ( [ static - polar ] ) has constant riemann curvature and vanishing torsion everywhere , except at @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "the conical singularity at @xmath56 is the locus of the static @xmath37-brane , where infinite curvature is concentrated .",
    "this dirac delta distribution has support in the center of the @xmath57-plane , that is the ( 1 - 2)-plane in the covering space @xmath39 , and we shall call it the 2-manifold @xmath58 . including the singular point , the ads curvature ( [ ads_curvatrure ] ) can then be written as @xmath24 , where the source is given by the current 2-form @xmath59 we have defined the dirac delta distribution 2-form that is coordinate - independent , @xmath60      in the _ non - extremal _ case , the massive spinning 0-brane can be obtained from the global ads metric ( [ ads metric ] ) by an identification produced by a linear combination of the killing vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this procedure closely follows the one described in ref.@xcite to construct the btz black hole .",
    "consider two angular deficits in the @xmath63- and @xmath64-planes in @xmath39 , @xmath65 the choice of real constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 is not unique since these parameters can be shifted by integers .",
    "we choose @xmath68 $ ] and note that @xmath69 means that there is no angular deficit .",
    "this identification in @xmath39 corresponds to an identification in ads@xmath38 space by some angle @xmath70 , what can be made explicit by redefining the coordinates as @xmath71 where @xmath70 is periodic with period @xmath72 .",
    "the transformation is invertible if @xmath73 .",
    "then , @xmath74 induces the following identification in @xmath39 , @xmath75 or , in an infinitesimal form , @xmath76 the identification is produced by the killing vector @xmath77 & = & 2\\pi a\\,\\partial _ { \\phi _ { 12}}+2\\pi b\\,\\partial _ { \\phi _ { 03}}\\,,\\label{nonextreml killing}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 are generators of rotations in @xmath39 , and @xmath79 according to the classification given in ref.@xcite , this killing vector is of the type * * i**@xmath80 when @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , and of type * * ii**@xmath83 when @xmath84 .",
    "thus , this geometry belongs to a sector topologically different from the btz black hole , produced by identifications of type * * i**@xmath83 ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) and type * * ii**@xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .    using the ortho - normality of the tangent vectors , @xmath89 , the norm of the killing vector @xmath90 reads @xmath91 \\,,\\ ] ] which is valid for any @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "however , notice that if @xmath92 , the norm @xmath93 is a time - like vector , and since it identifies different points in our geometry , it would lead to closed time - like curves .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath94 , @xmath95 after implementing the identification , the metric ( [ ads metric ] ) becomes @xmath96 in sum , the metric ( [ boosted metric ] ) is obtained from global ads by the transformation ( [ covering identification ] ) and simultaneous identifications of the embedding angles @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "alternatively , this metric with @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be re - interpreted as the static @xmath37-brane with angular defect @xmath99 , whose spin is introduced by boosting the azimuthal angle @xmath100 with the velocity @xmath101 , similarly to the construction in ref.@xcite for the spinning charged black hole .    indeed , if @xmath102 , we can always write @xmath103 , where @xmath104 $ ] , and parameterize the constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 in terms of a hyperbolic angle @xmath105 as @xmath106 and @xmath107 . then , @xmath108 can be re - interpreted as the rapidity of some lorentz transformation with velocity @xmath109 , @xmath101 , so that the original angular deficits are related to the boost velocity as @xmath110 now , the relations ( [ angles ] ) with @xmath97 and @xmath98 are equivalent to a single lorentz boost @xmath111 acting on the static @xmath37-brane , @xmath112 note that this interpretation is possible only for @xmath102 ( @xmath113 ) which means that the brane is not extremal , and allows for the identification in the @xmath114-plane as @xmath115 .",
    "the limit @xmath116 recovers the static brane ( @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath67 is related to the angular momentum of the brane .",
    "although the original static metric describes a manifold with a conical singularity , the addition of angular momentum makes the manifold regular , its curvature being constant everywhere @xcite .",
    "this spacetime , however , has a _ causal horizon _ ,",
    "the surface @xmath119 , where the norm of the killing vector field ( [ 3d_kv ] ) vanishes .",
    "the component @xmath120 of the metric also vanishes there , though its positivity should guarantee that @xmath70 is an angle .    in the exterior region , @xmath121 ,",
    "the vector field @xmath90 is space - like and the causal structure is well - defined . in the interior region , @xmath122 , @xmath90 becomes time - like allowing closed time - like curves .",
    "this region of spacetime can be removed by introducing a new radial coordinate @xmath123 , such that @xmath124 is always non - negative , or @xmath125 where the above transformation is valid for @xmath126 .",
    "the removed region corresponds to @xmath127 and @xmath128 , where the boundary @xmath129 is shrunk to a point in the @xmath123-@xmath70 plane .",
    "note that the identification @xmath130 as a single point in the @xmath123-@xmath70 plane is not produced by the killing vector .",
    "the region of interest , @xmath121 , excludes the original singularity where the static @xmath37-brane lays . in spite of this , in what follows we shall show that there is a singular behavior at @xmath56 due to the identification of this circle ( at fixed time ) with a point . if this identification had not been performed , the resulting spacetime would have been regular , but with a geometry similar to the one of the spinning btz black hole at @xmath56 ( see appendix b of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "once the region with closed time - like curves has been removed , the metric can be recast into the adm form @xmath131 where the lapse and shift functions are @xmath132 note that , with this parameterization , the metric is well - defined in the limit @xmath133 , although the extremal case is obtained by a different identification in ads space @xcite . however , this is a peculiarity of the three - dimensional metric only .",
    "even though the lagrangian governing the dynamics of this @xmath37-brane has not been introduced , the existence of a nontrivial angular momentum can be established by calculating the angular velocity , @xmath134 , at the circle @xmath135 , @xmath136    the geometry of this asymptotically locally ads spacetime is an analytic continuation of the @xmath137 black hole , where the parameters @xmath138 are continuations of the horizons @xmath139 . by comparison with the @xmath137 black hole , the real parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be related to the mass , @xmath140 , and angular momentum , @xmath141 , of the btz solution as @xmath142 even without the knowledge of the lagrangian .",
    "thus , the metric ( [ schwarzschild - like ] ) describes a btz - like @xmath37-brane with a negative mass parameter , @xmath143 , boosted with respect to the static brane as @xmath144 .",
    "the parameter @xmath145 is related to the angular momentum , @xmath146 .",
    "let us summarize what we have done so far .",
    "an identification by a killing vector of the pseudosphere @xmath147 embedded in @xmath39 amounts to a single identification by @xmath148 in ads@xmath45 .",
    "the resulting manifold @xmath149ads@xmath150 is described by the metric ( [ boosted metric ] ) .",
    "since the identification is made by an isometry and is properly discontinuous , except at @xmath151 , @xmath152 has constant curvature for @xmath153 and thus there is no curvature singularity .",
    "this manifold , however , contains closed time - like curves in the region @xmath122 ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to have a causally well defined spacetime , the region @xmath122 must be removed by cutting along the surface @xmath119 , defined by @xmath155 .",
    "then all points that satisfy @xmath119 at fixed time are identified , producing a new manifold , @xmath156 , which has a naked singularity at @xmath119 .",
    "another way of constructing the same geometry is the following .",
    "take the ads@xmath38 spacetime ( [ ads metric ] ) and remove a portion of space @xmath122 ( for some arbitrary @xmath157 ) . then identify the points of the resulting space with ( [ covering identification ] ) , where now @xmath66 and @xmath67 satisfy the relation with @xmath157 given by ( [ 3d_kv ] ) . in this way , no closed time - like curves are produced since the region where they would appear was already cut out from space , and also there is no singularity .",
    "now , the origin of the manifold is actually the circle @xmath119 ( @xmath56 ) for fixed time , so by identifying all those points which is _ not",
    "_ done by a killing vector a curvature singularity appears now at the origin .",
    "the question we want to analyze is what happens with the curvature at the point @xmath56 of @xmath156 after this last identification .",
    "the position of the source responsible for the singularity in spacetime is determined by the surface where the norm of the killing vector vanishes . in the case at hand",
    ", we thus expect a source with a dirac delta - like distribution of the form @xmath158 .",
    "as shown below , this is indeed the case and there are no stronger singularities on the manifold , such as @xmath159 , or @xmath160 , etc .",
    "in general , the singularity appears because the 1-form @xmath161 is not exact on the whole manifold @xmath156 .",
    "namely , at @xmath56 , where @xmath70 is not defined , it is not true that @xmath162 .",
    "thus , we shall assume that @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is some distribution that is zero when @xmath165 and infinite when @xmath56 .",
    "the static @xmath37-brane , for example , has @xmath166 .    in order to identify the source and nature of the singularity",

    "it has been recently claimed that spinning branes require derivatives of the dirac delta function ( or @xmath159 ) @xcite .",
    "those arguments rely on the condition of vanishing torsion everywhere but , as discussed below , this requirement is not met by the present solution . in fact , as can be observed from ( [ f ] ) , the torsional parts ( along @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) have the same singular behavior as the curvature parts ( along @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) .",
    "thus , the configurations analyzed in refs.@xcite , not obtained by identifications , correspond to different solutions compared to the ones considered here .",
    "let us assume a generic form for the singularity like @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is a power series in @xmath176 with coefficients depending on @xmath66 and @xmath67 . then , requiring that the static @xmath37-brane is recovered in the limit @xmath177 implies that @xmath175 can be , at most , a linear combination of @xmath178 and @xmath159 . finally , expanding the expressions in ( [ f ] ) as a series around @xmath56 leads to the source @xmath179 where @xmath180 \\,\\delta(r)\\,dr\\wedge d\\phi \\ , .",

    "the riemann curvature part of the source can be evaluated ( see appendix [ transport ] ) , with the result @xmath182 the torsional part of the source ( along the generators @xmath183 ) can not be obtained by the same parallel transport . however , comparing ( [ j_r ] ) with ( [ j(c ) ] ) , the @xmath184 terms match only if the distribution is identified as @xmath185 .",
    "the remaining components , along the generators @xmath183 , correspond to the torsional part of source , @xmath186 it is then plain to see that the source carries no singularities stronger than @xmath187 .    the above method to calculate @xmath20 is not easily generalized to higher dimensions because it calculates directly only the riemann curvature and the number of differential equations that need to be solved grows with the dimension .",
    "the most precise way to determine the source is to use the fact that @xmath23 is locally ` pure gauge ' , so the ads connection has the form @xmath188 where @xmath189 is a group element of ads . by solving this equation in @xmath189 with the ads connection given by ( [ a_ads ] ) , we obtain @xmath190 where @xmath191 , @xmath192 , we denote @xmath193 and @xmath194 is a constant element of the ads group .",
    "a non - trivial holonomy appears because @xmath189 is not single - valued .",
    "indeed , the holonomy @xmath195 is generated by the killing vector ( [ nonextreml killing ] ) as @xmath196 , up to a conjugation by a constant group element @xmath194 .",

    "locally ads @xmath37-branes can be constructed in any gravity theory with negative cosmological constant where global ads is an exact solution . in order to study their stability , one needs to know about the dynamics of the theory , and analyze fluctuations around the solution .",
    "we thus need to provide a bulk lagrangian , which we shall take to be cs ads supergravity .",
    "this is a gauge theory whose supergroup is @xmath213 @xmath214 @xmath215 , and it contains @xmath216 supersymmetries .",
    "apart from the vielbein and spin - connection , the super ads connection contains additional bosonic components , that we call the bosonic cs matter .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was shown that a static @xmath37-brane without bosonic cs matter is possibly unstable since it breaks all supersymmetries .",
    "inclusion of @xmath4 matter can stabilize the brane and turn it into a bps state by preserving some supersymmetries in an extremal , charged , static case . here",
    "we show that an extremal spinning @xmath37-brane can be a bps state even without bosonic matter , as first found in ref.@xcite in the special case of @xmath217 .",

    "thus , in the background of an uncharged 0-brane and with a suitable representation of the generators , the killing spinor equation for each copy of @xmath221 has the form @xmath223 \\epsilon _ { i}^{\\pm } = 0 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath224 are three - dimensional matrices satisfying the clifford algebra ( we consider only one of the two inequivalent representations of @xmath225-matrices , @xmath226 @xcite ) .",
    "the vielbein and spin - connection are given in eq.([a_ads ] ) .",
    "then , a general solution for the killing spinor is @xcite @xmath227 where @xmath228 is a constant spinor fulfilling the chirality projection @xmath229 this killing spinor is also _ globally _ well - defined if it satisfies periodic or anti - periodic boundary conditions for @xmath230 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath231 and @xmath232 . in consequence , @xmath233 implies the extremality condition @xmath234 when @xmath118 ( static case ) , the only possibility to have this condition satisfied is for global ads ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "for the spinning 0-brane , @xmath236 , the bps configuration can exist even without additional bosonic matter , because the angular momentum plays the role of a @xmath4 field .",

    "these bps states preserve @xmath239 supersymmetries ; a half is projected out by the condition ( [ projection ] ) .",
    "the result can be generalized to include charged 0-branes , as well .",

    "as discussed in @xcite , gauge invariant and background - independent couplings between a @xmath3-brane and a connection is provided by the generalization of the minimal coupling , where the role of the vector potential is played by the @xmath655-cs form .",
    "the bosonic sector of this supergravity is of the lovelock type and it has the unique ads vacuum @xmath15 . this vacuum is a degenerate zero of the cs field equations , that means that linear perturbation analysis is not well - defined in this background .",
    "this problem is circumvented in the supersymmetric case , by showing that the solution @xmath15 preserves some supersymmetries and , using symmetry arguments , that it must be a stable state whose charges saturate the bogomolnyi bound in this background .",
    "the situation in which there is no well - defined linear approximation around some very symmetric background is typical for higher - dimensional cs theories @xcite .",
    "the problem is originated in the so - called irregular sectors of the phase space , where the canonical hamiltonian analysis is not applicable . in these sectors , local symmetry increases and the number of physical degrees of freedom decreases @xcite .",
    "these sectors are not open sets in phase space , they are submanifolds of measure zero , and one can avoid them by adding to the background a suitable bosonic cs matter @xcite . in that way , one can work in the ads background in cs gravity even without involving supersymmetry .",
    "recently , another solution involving chern - simons coupling has been discussed in the context of electric - magnetic duality @xcite .",
    "this magnetically charged solution is geometrically like a dirac string , but it might be also electrically charged .",
