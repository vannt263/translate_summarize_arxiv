    "many chemical reactions must proceed through a potential barrier before the final dissociation of the products of the reaction can take place .",
    "thus , the reaction rate is governed by tunneling  @xcite .",
    "radioactive decay of nuclei also involves crossing a potential barrier , dictated by a combination of short - ranged strong binding forces and a longer - ranged coulomb repulsion  @xcite .",
    "a typical experimental situation is the absorption of a slow neutron ; the resulting metastable nucleus decays predominantly by tunneling through a saddle point , and the distribution of resonance widths is well described by random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "another important example of quantum tunneling is the conductance of mesoscopic devices  @xcite . in more than one dimension ,",
    "when the classical dynamics can be chaotic , quantum chaos plays a role .",
    "for instance , in the tunneling diode junction , in which electrons are driven by an applied electric field but must tunnel through potential barriers at either end of the device , the dynamics , in the presence of a magnetic field , is chaotic and scarring of a short periodic orbit is known to dominate the conduction  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study chaotic tunneling in a simple model potential , and establish the connection to scar theory , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "we prefer to study tunneling by calculating splittings in a double - well potential rather than resonance widths in a metastable well , because the former is an easier computational task , as we will see later in sec .",
    "[ method ] .",
    "the relation between splittings in a double - well potential and resonance widths in a metastable well will be discussed immediately below , where we will observe that the two quantities are related by known overall normalization factors .",
    "the double - well potential we will work with , in two dimensions , has the very simple form @xmath2 the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 will be specified below . for @xmath10 , a barrier along the @xmath11-axis separates the potential at low energies ( @xmath12 ) into two wells .",
    "the @xmath13 term ensures that the potential is not separable , while the gaussian perturbations , the parameters of which may be changed at will , allow us to generate an ensemble of statistically independent eigenstates near any given energy . if the positions and heights of the gaussians are chosen suitably , the potential has reflection symmetries in the @xmath14 and @xmath11 directions .",
    "the symmetry under reflection in @xmath11 means that there will always be a short periodic orbit on the @xmath14-axis , in each of the two wells .",
    "the principal result of this paper is that the size of the level splittings in the two - dimensional double well , the classical dynamics of which is chaotic , is directly correlated with the scarring of eigenfunctions along the @xmath14-axis , which we believe to be the primary channel for tunneling .",
    "the evidence for this is that ( 1 ) the distribution of splittings , once the average exponential trend in energy is scaled out , displays oscillations as a function of energy of the sort expected by scar theory . in particular ,",
    "the action distance between successive peaks is precisely @xmath15 .",
    "however , the dependence of the mean splitting on action is not well reproduced quantitatively by linear scar theory , because non - linear effects appear to be important .",
    "( 2 ) the rescaled splittings are correlated with the overlap of the eigenstate with a gaussian test state lying on the periodic orbit on the @xmath14-axis , a measure of scarring .",
    "( 3 ) the correlation of the splittings with the overlaps is further supported by the fact that the distribution of overlaps has the same energy - dependent oscillations as the distribution of splittings .",
    "according to one - dimensional wkb theory , the splitting @xmath16 in a symmetric double well is given in the semiclassical limit by @xmath17 while the resonance width @xmath18 for the state at the same energy in a metastable well is @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the frequency of the classical periodic motion at energy @xmath21 and the imaginary action for going under the barrier is @xmath22 @xmath23 being the position of the classical turning point at energy @xmath21  @xcite . in order for the semiclassical theory to apply",
    ", @xmath21 must be sufficiently far below the barrier that @xmath24 .",
    "note the factor of two in the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ gwkb ] ) .",
    "these one - dimensional formulae may be generalized to the two - dimensional ( or higher - dimensional ) potential well as follows .",
    "we expect tunneling to be dominated by paths that cross the barrier close to the @xmath14-axis , which has the smallest action integral @xmath25 .",
    "the splitting @xmath26 will then be proportional to the exponential factor @xmath27 .",
    "the correct generalization of the frequency of attempts to cross the barrier , @xmath20 , to two or more dimensions , is the frequency with which one returns to a planck - sized cell in phase space that lies on the horizontal periodic orbit .",
    "this horizontal periodic orbit is the real continuation of the least - action path across the barrier .",
    "the time for returning to such a cell ( or to any other cell in an ergodic well ) is the heisenberg time @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the mean level spacing near energy @xmath30",
    "( i.e. , the spacing between doublets in the double - well system ) . then the frequency of attempts to cross the barrier is just proportional to the mean level spacing @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we expect on general grounds that the splitting @xmath26 is given in order of magnitude by @xmath31 , which gives us the trend of the splittings as a function of energy .",
    "this expression for the mean splitting will be confirmed by the exact semiclassical theory to be discussed below .    for any given state",
    ", we should expect that its splitting will be large or small compared with the mean value at that energy according to whether its amplitude is large or small on the horizontal periodic orbit which leads to optimal tunneling . for simplicity we can study the wave function amplitude near the turning point of the horizontal periodic orbit .",
    "the value of the wave function at the turning point in the two - dimensional chaotic system is ( ignoring scar - related effects which are the main focus of this paper ) given approximately by a gaussian - distributed random variable , as random matrix theory would predict .",
    "thus , @xmath32 has , according to random matrix theory , a porter ",
    "thomas distribution for all energies far enough below the barrier ( near zero energy the horizontal periodic orbit becomes stable and the distribution of splittings rolls over to one having many more large and small splittings , corresponding to wave functions that live near or avoid this stable orbit ) .",
    "however , what is relevant to tunneling in @xmath33 dimensions is not just the value of the wave function exactly at the turning point but rather its behavior in a whole @xmath34sized region surrounding the periodic orbit .",
    "we shall see below that the right quantity to consider is the inner product of the wave function with a gaussian centered on the periodic orbit ( at the turning point or at some other location ) .",
    "this has as well a porter ",
    "thomas distribution , within the random matrix theory approximation .",
    "scar - related effects and finite-@xmath1 effects on the distribution of splittings will be discussed below .",
    "the viewpoint summarized above is in agreement with the theoretical work of creagh and whelan @xcite .",
    "first , they find that the mean splitting @xmath35 at a given energy is given by the product of an exponential factor @xmath27 , a factor proportional to the mean spacing between doublets , as described above , and a third factor that carries information about the monodromy matrix of the ( imaginary time ) tunneling orbit .",
    "then they show that , for chaotic and symmetric double wells , the splitting for a particular eigenvalue , relative to the mean splitting , may be written in the semiclassical limit as a matrix element of the wave function @xmath36 near the real continuation @xmath37 of the complex trajectory that passes through the barrier with minimum ( imaginary ) action . this imaginary - time trajectory and its real - time continuation",
    "may be thought of as the optimal route for tunneling .",
    "the matrix element @xmath38 involves integration over a poincar surface transverse to the real continuation @xmath37 .",
    "the kernel @xmath39 is a semiclassical green s function which , in the approximation that the dominant contribution to the tunneling matrix element comes from the neighborhood of @xmath37 , becomes a gaussian centered on the intersection of @xmath37 with the poincar section .",
    "the width of the gaussian is of @xmath40 in both directions ( e.g. @xmath11 and @xmath41 ) tangent to the surface of section .",
    "[ the results may of course be easily generalized to dimensions @xmath42 , where the resulting gaussian has width of @xmath40 in all @xmath43 directions along the surface of section . ]    in the case that the real continuation @xmath37 happens to lie on a short periodic orbit , which will always be true when a reflection symmetry across the @xmath14-axis is present , this matrix element may be regarded as a measure of scarring on the periodic orbit . the creagh",
    "whelan theory predicts , therefore , that strong scarring should be correlated with large splittings , confirming the intuitive expectation that high tunneling rates should occur for those wave functions that have large amplitude along the path with optimal tunneling . neither in ref .",
    "@xcite nor in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , do the authors demonstrate the connection between scarring and splittings on a state - by - state basis . in the latter work",
    ", they confirm their formula for the tunneling matrix element by deriving from it an analytical prediction for the statistical distribution of splittings .",
    "this prediction is in agreement with numerical calculations for potentials in which the real continuation of the optimal tunneling orbit is _ not _ a periodic orbit ; when it is , the random - matrix assumption in their derivation breaks down due to scarring on this periodic orbit .",
    "thus , the present paper , while confirming the predictions of creagh and whelan , goes beyond their results by establishing conclusively the link between scarring and tunneling and by showing , with better statistics , that the distribution of scaled splittings indeed becomes approximately porter ",
    "thomas , but only after scarring effects have been taken into account .",
    "the wave functions and splittings were calculated numerically using the discrete variable representation  @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of the position operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 and of the kinetic energy operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 were first evaluated analytically using standard identities , in a basis of up to the first 300 gauss - hermite functions in each dimension .",
    "then , in order to take advantage of the two reflection symmetries in @xmath14 and @xmath11 , the two operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 were diagonalized .",
    "the reason for using @xmath48 and @xmath49 instead of the usual choice of @xmath44 and @xmath45 is that @xmath48 , @xmath46 , @xmath49 and @xmath47 are all block - diagonal , connecting only basis elements within one of the four symmetry classes ( even  even , even ",
    "odd , odd  even and odd ",
    "since we are interested only in even  even potentials of the form @xmath50 we can just as well compute @xmath51 at the eigenvalues of @xmath48 and @xmath49 as at those of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , but using the basis obtained by diagonalizing @xmath48 and @xmath49 ensures that the final hamiltonian @xmath52 will be itself also block diagonal .",
    "the four symmetry classes may therefore be analyzed separately . in the basis",
    "chosen the potential @xmath51 is of course diagonal , while , in two or more dimensions , the kinetic energy matrix will be sparse . more precisely , if @xmath53 is the dimension of one of the blocks in the hamiltonian matrix , the total number of non - zero matrix entries scales as @xmath54 , or @xmath55 in the two - dimensional system .",
    "since we require large values of @xmath53 in order to observe semiclassical behavior , a sparse matrix routine is the method of choice for diagonalizing @xmath56 .",
    "the accuracy of the computed eigenvalues was tested for convergence under increase of @xmath53 , and for the parameters given below we found convergence to @xmath57 for @xmath58 , corresponding to about 200 gauss - hermite functions in the @xmath14 direction and about 100 in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "the amount of phase space covered by the region @xmath12 , and thus the number of states under the barrier and the computation time , increases very rapidly with @xmath3 . if all other parameters in the hamiltonian are kept fixed , the number of states grows as @xmath59 , and so the largest value of @xmath3 we can easily attain is about @xmath60 , for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . at these parameter values",
    ", each well has a depth of @xmath63 and about 100 bound states , where @xmath1 is taken to be unity here and in the following .",
    "the typical level spacing near the top of the well is @xmath64 , and the splittings range from @xmath65 near the top of the well to @xmath66 near @xmath67 ; below this energy many of the splittings become too small ( @xmath68 ) to be resolved numerically .",
    "therefore we take @xmath67 to be the lower cutoff for the energies to be analyzed in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "the potential given by eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , apart from the gaussian perturbation , is mostly integrable for all energies except those near the top of the barrier .",
    "when the gaussian perturbations are introduced , the classical mechanics becomes more chaotic , but if these perturbations are too small it is still possible that they would not be seen by the quantum mechanics , which would remain effectively integrable .",
    "thus , in order to render the quantum mechanics at energies corresponding to the bound states chaotic as well , it is necessary to introduce a gaussian perturbation that is at least as large as the wavelength in question , and whose height is comparable in magnitude to the depth of the potential well .",
    "the simplest choice is to place large gaussian perturbations above the minima of the potential well at @xmath69 , which will be seen by every bound trajectory as it crosses the center of the well and which thus effectively make the dynamics chaotic at energies down to the lowest considered ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this was checked classically by examining the poincar surfaces of section and may also be seen to be true quantum - mechanically in fig .",

    "we generate an ensemble of 625 systems by placing four further gaussians ( and their reflections in @xmath14 and @xmath11 ) at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with heights @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and with equal widths @xmath77 as above . a contour plot of the potential for a typical member of the ensemble is given in fig .",

    "we find very pronounced oscillations in the distribution of splittings as a function of energy .",
    "as discussed in sec .  [ intro ] , we expect theoretically that the rescaled splitting should be proportional to the overlap in a poincar section of the eigenfunction with a gaussian on the horizontal periodic orbit . if the gaussian may be assumed to have area exactly @xmath15 in the poincar section , such overlaps are described by scar theory @xcite .",
    "we expect the results to be qualitatively the same even if the gaussian in the poincar section given by the theory of creagh and whelan is not a minimum - uncertainty state , as long as it is not too large compared to @xmath15 ( in the latter limit , scar effects must go to zero in accord with the schnirelman ergodicity theorem @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in the data presented below the area of the creagh ",
    "whelan gaussian ranged from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "the prediction of scar theory is that , at a given energy , the distribution of splittings should be porter ",
    "thomas , and that the mean wave function intensity and therefore the mean splitting should oscillate as energy is varied by an amount that depends on the lyapunov exponent and the monodromy matrix of the unstable periodic orbit .",
    "an important confirmation of the scarring picture is obtained when we plot , in fig .",
    "[ sa ] , the rescaled splittings versus the action ( divided by @xmath82 ) of the horizontal periodic orbit at the energy eigenvalue .",
    "we find that the oscillations are periodic in action with period @xmath82 , which indicates that the ebk quantization condition for scarring holds .",
    "the ebk quantization condition for the action reads @xmath83 where @xmath84 is an integer and @xmath85 is the number of conjugate points in one period of the orbit ( @xmath86 in the case of the horizontal orbit in our system ) .",

    "the correlation coefficient of the logarithms is 0.78 ; it may be that the degree of correlation would be improved if the gaussian were chosen to be properly aligned with respect to the monodromy matrix of the optimal tunneling path .",
    "the observed correlation nevertheless confirms that there is a direct connection , on a state - by - state basis , between scarring and tunneling , as predicted by the theory of creagh and whelan @xcite . as a check on our results",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ oe ] that the overlaps display the same energy - dependent oscillations as do the splittings , as they must if the phenomenon of scarring underlies the behavior of both",
    ".    the connection between scarring and tunneling can be tested quantitatively in two ways .",
    "first , scar theory in the semiclassical limit predicts that the short - time ( smooth ) envelope describing the oscillations in the mean rescaled splitting versus action is given by the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function @xmath87 is its iterate after @xmath88 bounces .",
    "the gaussian @xmath89 is chosen to have the same orientation and aspect ratio in the @xmath90-plane as the gaussian called for by the creagh ",
    "whelan theory , but linearly rescaled so as to have area @xmath15 as needed for scar theory . linearizing the dynamics around the horizontal periodic orbit we find",
    ", when the gaussian wave packet is optimally aligned along the stable and unstable manifolds of the periodic orbit , @xmath91 where @xmath5 is the lyapunov exponent of the periodic orbit . in the special case of orthogonal stable and unstable manifolds , a circular gaussian will be one example of an optimally aligned wave packet .",
    "if the gaussian is not optimally aligned , this formula may be generalized as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93 describes a gaussian of the form @xmath94 with @xmath95 representing the coordinates in the surface of section , and @xmath96 is the jacobian of the poincar mapping evaluated at the periodic orbit ( @xmath97 ) . the matrix @xmath93 is computed as specified in the creagh  whelan theory from the monodromy matrix of the complex orbit that begins at the poincar section on the right , goes through the barrier , and ends at the poincar section in the left well @xcite . here , the lyapunov exponent @xmath5 and jacobian @xmath96 vary with energy over the range @xmath98 . at higher energies",
    ", the trajectory spends less time near the gaussian at the center of the well , and thus experiences less deflection , leading to greater stability , eventually becoming stable for @xmath99 . the short - time envelope obtained as the fourier transform of @xmath100 in either eq .",
    "( [ auto1 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ auto2 ] ) may be compared with the mean rescaled splitting plotted versus action . as shown in fig .",
    "[ envelope ] , with either form of the autocorrelation function we do find peaks in the predicted envelope of splittings at the right values of action for energies @xmath101 ( for energies @xmath99 the horizontal periodic orbit becomes stable , so the scar theory does not apply and no prediction about the distribution of splittings can be made ) , but the heights of the maxima and minima between the peaks are not well reproduced . the contrast predicted by eq .",
    "( [ auto2 ] ) is closer to the numerical data than that predicted by eq .",
    "( [ auto1 ] ) .",
    "the quantitative failure of semiclassical scar theory is attributable to the fact that , for our parameter values , the linearizable region around the horizontal periodic orbit is not large compared to @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , the size of the linearizable region is only about 0.15@xmath15 for the energies considered .",
    "its size , however , is approximately independent of energy for @xmath102 , and this may explain the weak dependence of the peak height on energy observed in the numerical data .",
    "nevertheless , we see that not only is scarring associated with larger splittings in the coarse sense of fig .  [ so ] but also",
    "the enhancement factor in the distribution of splittings , as a function of energy or of action , does oscillate with energy or action in agreement with the analytical prediction of scar theory ; only the precise magnitude of these oscillations remains unexplained within the present linear theory .",
    "a second quantitative test of scar theory in relation to tunneling is to examine the change in the distribution of splittings upon change in the lyapunov exponent .",
    "the horizontal periodic orbit can easily be made more stable by keeping the height of the main gaussian bump fixed at 150 while increasing its width .",
    "an ensemble of eigenstates and associated splittings was computed , just as above , for a larger value of the bump width , namely @xmath103 instead of @xmath104 .",
    "the expectation from scar theory would be for the distribution of splittings to have many more smaller and larger splittings at the resulting smaller lyapunov exponent . at @xmath72 ,",
    "the horizontal periodic orbit is stable down to @xmath105 ; the lyapunov exponent then increases from zero with decreasing energy to a value of @xmath106 at @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath107 it is stable down to @xmath108 and attains only a value of @xmath109 at @xmath67 .",
    "the numerical data , however , show no marked difference between the two computations at @xmath72 and @xmath107 ; see fig .",
    "the lack of any difference between the distributions of splittings despite the difference in stability is an indication that we are not far enough into the semiclassical limit ( see discussion below ) . in both cases the distribution of rescaled splittings ( see the histograms in fig .  [ sll ] )",
    "has many more small and large splittings , and consequently fewer splittings around @xmath110 , than a porter  thomas distribution would have ( except for the sharp cutoff at @xmath111 , which will be discussed below ) .",
    "thus , the prediction of scar theory that there should be many more small and large splittings , relative to the prediction of random matrix theory , is confirmed .",
    "also , the divergence of the probability distribution near zero splitting in the case of scarring on the real continuation of the optimal tunneling path differs markedly from the results , both analytical and numerical , of creagh and whelan @xcite for the case when the real continuation is not a periodic orbit , which show a probability distribution tending to zero at zero splitting . our numerical results for the scarring case improve on their statistics and",
    "allow us to discern the scar corrections to porter  thomas behavior .",
    "in particular , we note the excess of very small splittings ; these correspond to the phenomenon of antiscarring , as seen in fig .",
    "[ sa ] at actions halfway between values of action given by the ebk quantization condition for maximal scarring . as studied by kaplan @xcite , in an open quantum system coupled to the environment by one channel located on a short unstable periodic orbit ,",
    "antiscarring causes the probability to remain in the system at times large compared to the heisenberg time to be substantially enhanced relative to the prediction of random matrix theory .",
    "therefore , we must expect that antiscarring , which we have demonstrated now for the case of level splittings in a smooth chaotic double - well potential , would markedly alter , away from random matrix theory predictions , the distribution of resonance widths in a chaotic metastable potential , and also the long - time probability to remain in such a well .    in fig .",
    "[ esvsd ] we show the relation between the rescaled splitting @xmath112 and the mean level spacing @xmath113 , which decreases from about 3 at @xmath67 to about 1 at @xmath114 , aside from some fluctuations .",
    "there is no direct correlation between @xmath112 and @xmath113 , thus refuting the intuitive expectation that the tunneling rate should be proportional only to the rate of attempts to cross the barrier given by the classical motion , as discussed above in section [ intro ] . in the presence of scarring on the horizontal periodic orbit ,",
    "tunneling is enhanced by the tendency to remain near the horizontal periodic orbit . at energies for which scarring takes place",
    ", the typical wave function intensity measured using a gaussian at the turning point will be enhanced by a factor of @xmath115 compared with the naive expectation , where @xmath5 is the lyapunov exponent . at energies for which antiscarring , a tendency to avoid the horizontal periodic orbit , takes place ,",
    "this typical intensity will be strongly suppressed , by an amount that is exponentially small in @xmath5 for small @xmath5 .",
    "the actual distribution of the rescaled splitting @xmath112 versus the level spacing @xmath29 includes the same energy - dependent oscillations seen in fig .",
    "[ serescaled ] , as a function of @xmath29 rather than of @xmath30 itself .",
    "it is evident , then , that chaotic tunneling in two dimensions must be thought of as a quantum - coherent phenomenon , in which the probability of tunneling through the barrier is greater if one comes back in phase when making repeated attempts to cross the barrier , as happens for scarred eigenfunctions .",
    "we also note that the horizontal periodic orbit becomes more unstable at lower energies , leading to smaller scar peaks in the mean wave function intensity on the orbit , and thus compensating to some extent for an increase in the mean level spacing at lower energies .",
    "this may partly explain the absence a clear trend in the data of fig .",
    "[ esvsd ] .",
    "we now discuss how our data are limited by the fact that we must work at finite @xmath1 .",
    "first , the sharp cutoff at large splittings in the numerical data relative to the porter  thomas distribution in fig .",
    "[ sll ] is a finite-@xmath1 effect .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "let the poincar surface of section have area @xmath53 in units of @xmath15 .",
    "then the expected squared overlap @xmath116 of an eigenstate with a gaussian test state will be @xmath117 , because the test state covers an area @xmath15 in phase space while the eigenstate is , on average , spread evenly over the entire phase space .",
    "now the cutoff arises from the fact that no matter how scarred or otherwise localized the eigenstate is , its overlap with a test state can not be greater than unity .",
    "so @xmath118 by construction , or @xmath119 .",

    "this indicates that at @xmath134 we are far enough into the semiclassical regime to see characteristic semiclassical behavior for the locations of the scarring peaks , if not for their precise heights .",
    "we have demonstrated that scarring on the real continuation of the optimal tunneling path , if it is an unstable periodic orbit , enhances tunneling and thus leads to larger splittings between the symmetric and antisymmetric in @xmath14 eigenfunctions at energies near the scarring energies ( likewise , antiscarring in between the scarring energies leads to smaller splittings ) .",
    "the energy dependence of the distribution of splittings displays ebk quantization , and the shape of the smooth envelope is roughly consistent with the prediction of scar theory , though the magnitude of the oscillations is not quantitatively predicted by the simple linearized dynamics ; a better understanding of the shape of the envelope would require extending scar theory to the non - linear regime . also , the distribution of splittings is approximately porter ",
    "thomas with scarring corrections , as we would expect on the basis of scar theory combined with the theory of creagh and whelan , discussed in section [ intro ] .",
    "we do not find , however , the expected dependence on the lyapunov exponent of the horizontal periodic orbit .",
    "this is presumably due to the fact that our calculations do not probe very far into the semiclassical limit , our well being only a few wavelengths across in the transverse ( @xmath11 ) direction .",
    "finite-@xmath1 effects cut off the far tail of the splitting distribution at all energies .    according to eqs .",
    "( [ dewkb ] ) and ( [ gwkb ] ) , suitably generalized to the chaotic double - well potential in two dimensions as discussed in section [ intro ] , the rescaled resonance widths in a single metastable well , the potential of which agreed with the double - well potential we are using for @xmath135 , would have the same distribution as the rescaled splittings we have computed .",
    "thus , our results imply a non - statistical distribution of resonance widths in a chaotic metastable well . in view of its importance for chemical physics , this conclusion deserves further investigation .",
    "finally , we discuss the prospects for many - dimensional systems .",
    "if there exists an unstable periodic orbit near the real continuation of the optimal tunneling path in a double well or metastable well , scarring and antiscarring will again play a role .",
    "the only question is whether the degree of instability is small enough for scarring to be important ; for a lyapunov exponent @xmath5 large compared to unity the short - time envelope approaches the uniform limit of random matrix theory .",
    "however , as long as the sum of all instability exponents in directions transverse to the reaction coordinate does not become large , scarring effects are expected to appear , just as in the two - dimensional case discussed in the present paper .",
