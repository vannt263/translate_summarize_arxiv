    "the main contributors to the uv emission from any stellar system are the hottest stars .",
    "indeed blue horizontal branch ( hb ) stars are well known to be among the hottest stellar populations in globular clusters ( gcs ) and contribute substantially to the uv radiation observed from old stellar systems ( welch & code , 1972 ) . later on , two other sub - classes of post - hb stars",
    "were found to be important contributors to far - uv ( @xmath0 , @xmath31600 ) radiation ( e.g. , greggio and renzini 1990 ; dorman et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter dor95 ; han et al .",
    "the hottest hb stars ( extreme hb , ehb ) have such a small envelope mass that most of their post - he - core burning phase takes place at high effective temperature ( ) , during the so called `` agb - manqu phase '' , and these stars never return to the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "another group of uv - bright stars is that of post - early agb stars , which after a brief return to the agb , spend the bulk of their helium shell burning phase at high . in systems with only red",
    "hb a small floor level of @xmath0 is provided by post - agb stars , which evolve to the agb phase with an higher envelope mass where they undergo thermal pulses and eventually lose their envelopes moving at higher temperatures at constant luminosity .",
    "the relative contributions of the various types of stars and the factors that might lead to larger or smaller populations of uv - bright stars have remained an open question ( greggio and renzini 1990 ; dor95 ; lee et al .",
    "2002 ; rich et al . 2005 ; sohn et al . 2006 ) .    in distant extragalactic systems one can ordinarily observe only the integrated light of unresolved stellar populations ,",
    "from which the hope is to gain knowledge about the underlying stellar population .",
    "galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) play an important role in understanding the integrated uv colors of extragalactic systems , especially the so called `` uv - upturn '' observed in the spectral energy distributions of elliptical galaxies ( code & welch 1979 ; de boer 1982 ; bertola et al .",
    "1982 ; greggio & renzini 1990 ; oconnell 1999 ) .",
    "first of all , gcs are the closest example in nature to a single stellar population ( ssp ) : a system of coeval stars with similar chemical composition dex ) spread in the iron abundance and ( possibly ) age : @xmath4 centauri ( norris et al . 1996 , lee et al . 1999 , ferraro et al . 2004 ) and terzan  5 ( ferraro et al . 2009 ) .",
    "] . moreover ggcs span a large range of metallicities , a small range of ages , and perhaps some range of helium abundance .",
    "hence they can be used to test the stellar evolution theory , which in turn is one of the basic ingredients of the models used to interpret the integrated light of distant galaxies .",
    "ggcs are relatively nearby objects ( more than @xmath5 are located at distances @xmath6kpc ) , so their populations can be easily resolved . with typically more than 100,000 stars , even relatively short - lived evolutionary stages are sampled .",
    "we can directly observe the properties of individual stars and measure the population ratios for objects in different evolutionary stages .",
    "in particular we can study the impact of hot and bright populations ( as the agb - manqu stars ) on the integrated uv light of ggcs and then use them as crucial local templates for comparison with integrated properties of distant extragalactic systems .",
    "in fact comparing features in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of well known and resolved ggcs with integrated quantities can lend important _ model independent _ insights into the nature of extragalactic systems .",
    "integrated uv photometry of ggcs has previously been obtained by the _ orbiting astronomical observatory _ ( oao  2 ; welch & code 1980 ) , _ astronomical netherlands satellite _ ( ans ; van albada , de boer & dickens 1981 ) , _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _ ( uit ; hill et al .",
    "1992 ; landsman et al .",
    "1992 ; parise et al . 1994 ; whitney et al .",
    "1994 ) , and _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( iue ; castellani & cassatella 1987 ) . using a large , but heterogeneous , collection of data obtained with some of these telescopes along with population synthesis models ,",
    "dor95 showed how the uv colors varied with parameters like metallicity and how they compare with elliptical galaxies .",
    "they showed how the uv colors of ggcs could plausibly be produced by hot hb stars and their progeny .    at the time of dor95 ,",
    "uv photometry of individual stars in ggcs was available for only a few clusters .",
    "that situation has changed dramatically .",
    "our group alone has already published hst uv photometry for a dozen of ggcs ( see ferraro et al .",
    "1997 , ferraro et al .",
    "1998 , ferraro et al .",

    "2012 , sanna et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , we have secured observations of 44 ggcs during three observing cycles with the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) .",
    "this is the largest homogeneous sample ever collected for ggcs in uv so far . in schiavon",
    "et al . ( 2012 ; hereafter paper i ) we presented photometry and cmds for these clusters . here",
    "we present integrated uv magnitudes and colors (   2 ) for each cluster , and we describe (   3 ) how they are affected by hb class , metallicity , age , and possibly structural parameters ( mass , density , central relaxation time , etc . ) . in ",
    "4 we compare our data with observations of gcs in m31 and m87 .",
    "images for 38 ggcs were obtained as part of gi1 and gi4 galex programs ( p.i .",
    "r. p. schiavon ) and supplemented with somewhat shallower exposures for 8 ggcs obtained as part of program gi3 ( p.i . , s. sohn ) .",
    "two clusters ( ngc  6229 and ngc  6864 ) are in common between the two programs . a number of clusters that would have been very interesting targets ( including m13 , m80 , @xmath4centauri , ngc  6388 , and ngc  6441 ) could not be observed because of restrictions on the uv background brightness , due to detector - safety considerations , which prevented us from targeting at low galactic latitudes , or near positions of very bright uv sources . with only one exception ( ngc  6273 ) , images were obtained in both the @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) and near - uv ( @xmath1 , @xmath8 ) bands .",
    "thanks to the wide field of view of galex ( @xmath9 ) , it has been possible to sample the full radial extent of most of the clusters .",
    "a few gcs , like ngc  104 ( 47tuc ) and ngc  5272 ( m3 ) , have tidal radii larger than the galex field of view ( mclauglhin & van der marel 2005 , hereafter mvm05 ) , but these missing data do not significantly affect our analysis .",
    "each galex image has been pre - processed by the standard pipeline described in detail by morrissey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . the raw images ( or `` count images '' )",
    "have been converted to flux - calibrated intensity images by applying relative response and flat - field corrections and by scaling the flux by the effective area and exposure time .",
    "the integrated magnitudes have been obtained using two different approaches : _ ( i ) _ by fitting the surface brightness profiles ( sbps ) , and _",
    "( ii ) _ from direct aperture photometry ( ap ) measurement on the images . in both approaches",
    ", the integrated photometry will include the effects of objects below the detection threshold for individual stars . comparing the results obtained with these two different approaches we can correct for systematic effects or biases . in particular , ap can be affected by small number statistics when a few very bright stars dominate the flux , especially at @xmath0 wavelengths ( as for example , the case of the bright star in the very central regions of 47  tuc reported by oconnell et al .",
    "these very bright objects may be cluster members ( post - hb or post - agb star ) or just foreground stars . on the other hand",
    ", while colors obtained by the sbp method are less affected by star count fluctuations , they may suffer from uncertainties arising from the quality of the fit or the determination of the center of the cluster .",
    "for these reasons we have calculated integrated magnitudes with both the techniques , and we have compared the results in detail .    in both cases , it was first necessary to determine the cluster centers .",
    "since previous determinations ( e.g. , harris 1996 , 2010 revision  hereafter h10 ; noyola & gebhardt 2006 ; goldsbury et al . 2010 ) either were obtained with quite heterogeneous methods , or only partially overlap our sample , we preferred to perform new estimates .",
    "the plate scale of galex ( @xmath10 ) and the `` noise '' due to the relatively small number of stars detected at uv band introduce considerable uncertainty in the measurement of the barycenter of resolved stars ( e.g. , lanzoni et al .",
    "we therefore determined the center of the light distribution on @xmath1 images by following the same approach described in bellazzini ( 2007 ) . for any given gc we picked an aperture radius that , based on the size of cluster central region and its density , was large enough to include a good fraction of the brightest sources .",
    "we then determined the light density ( i.e. the fraction of observed flux per unit area ) in that aperture and iteratively varied the centering position until maximum light density was found .",
    "we do not list the centers of light , since they have been obtained in instrumental coordinates and therefore they could be used only when the images they refer to are available .",
    "moreover the poor spatial resolution of the galex detectors would have prevented to obtain a sufficient level of accuracy to make these values useful to the community for other applications .",
    "sbps were obtained by using concentric annuli centered on the cluster centers determined as described above .",
    "the number and the size of the annuli were chosen for each cluster so as they sampled almost the same light fraction .",
    "the flux calculation was performed by using standard iraf tasks ( _ phot _ , in the daophot package , stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the flux calculated in each annulus was normalized to the sampled area obtained adopting as pixel size @xmath11 , as reported by morrissey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for intensity map images .",
    "the instrumental surface brightness profiles were then transformed to the abmag galex magnitude system by applying the zero - points reported in the galex on - line user s manual or in section 4.2 of morrissey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . as an example",
    ", the observed sbp of ngc  6341 is shown in figure  1 for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels . in this figure ,",
    "solid squares are the annular surface brightness measurements at each cluster radius , whereas open circles represent the same values after performing sky subtraction as described below .",
    "using sbps to obtain integrated colors requires the subtraction of the background contribution , which is the combination of the sky background emission ( due to unresolved objects ) and the resolved field ( back and foreground ) sources .",
    "we determined the background as the average value in the annuli at large radii where the observed sbps show a `` plateau '' ( for @xmath12 in ngc  6341 , see figure  [ figprof1 ] ) .",
    "the average has been obtained applying a sigma - clipping rejection to take into account possible surface brightness fluctuations , since at low surface brightness levels even a few background stars may cause strong deviations from the general behavior , even in extended areas .",
    "we then subtracted the background light density from the observed surface brightnesses in each radial bin thus deriving `` decontaminated '' sbps .",
    "as expected , background subtraction does not significantly affect the central regions , but it substantially changes the shape of the profile in the external parts .    to further check the robustness of our method",
    ", we compared our background subtracted sbps with those computed with standard iraf packages ( _ phot _ and _ fitsky _ ) .",
    "the open triangles in the upper panel of figure  [ figprof1 ] are obtained with background subtraction and disabling the sigma - clipping routines .",
    "they nicely overlap with the open circles thus demonstrating that our approach is essentially equivalent to the automatic procedure .",
    "still we preferred to independently fit the observed `` plateau '' in order to have a more direct control of the background level which can be strongly variable case by case .",
    "the errors for each bin are defined as the standard deviations of the sampled fluxes .",
    "we assumed that counts from both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 detectors have a poisson distribution . to determine the value of the central surface brightness",
    ", we have fitted the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sbps with single - mass king models over the entire cluster extension . for each system and each band",
    "we adopted the core radius and concentration ( together with their uncertainties ) quoted by mvm05 , and we performed a mono - parametric fit , varying only the central surface brightness : the value yielding the minimum @xmath13 value was adopted as best - fit solution .",
    "magnitudes were then calculated by integrating the best - fit king model .",
    "the extinction coefficients used to correct the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fluxes are taken from cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and the @xmath14 values were adopted from h10 .    in general the observed sbps",
    "are very nicely reproduced by king models with the adopted structural parameters ( see the case of ngc 6341 in figure  [ figprof1 ] ) .",
    "exceptions to this general trend are the post core collapse clusters in our sample ( ngc  6284 , ngc  6342 , ngc  6397 and ngc  7099 ) .",
    "for these systems , which are not studied by mvm05 , it is not possible to fit in a satisfactory fashion the overall shape of the sbps with structural parameters typically adopted for post - core collapse clusters ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; see h10 for example ) . in these cases",
    "integrated magnitudes have been obtained with aperture photometry only ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "in addition we were not able to obtain a reliable measure in one or both filters for palomar  11 and palomar  12 , because of the low signal to noise ratio of the images .",
    "we tested also the impact of using wilson models ( wilson 1975 ) with structural parameters from mvm05 .",
    "we find that these models may give up to @xmath17 mag of difference for integrated magnitudes , but they have a null effect on colors .",
    "the errors in the integrated magnitudes were obtained by propagating the uncertainties affecting the structural parameters ( as reported by mvm05 ) and the central surface brightness determination .",
    "another important source of uncertainty is that affecting the determination of the cluster centers .",
    "this can cause variations in central surface brightness estimates that are independent of the other parameters involved in the sbp fit . to quantify the possible errors due to mis - positioning of the cluster centers , we let the centers iteratively vary by up to 5  from our determinations .",
    "we found maximum variations of @xmath18 in the @xmath19 color , mainly due to the errors in @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "the colors derived are listed in table  1 .",
    "integrated magnitudes in the @xmath20 band were also obtained from integration of king models , adopting the central surface brightnesses reported by h10 .",
    "direct measurements of the integrated magnitude were obtained by performing ap using the _ phot _ task under the iraf package . for each cluster we used a single fixed aperture with radius equal to the half - light radius ( @xmath21 ) quoted by mvm05 ( or taken from h10 for the 5 clusters mentioned above ) . by definition , the total magnitude",
    "was then computed by adding -0.75 to the value measured within @xmath21 .",
    "the adopted center , background flux , and @xmath14 values were the same as above .",
    "again the integrated instrumental magnitudes have been converted to the abmag galex magnitude system and corrected for extinction .",
    "the photometric errors are defined as the standard deviations of the fluxes .",
    "for both approaches , we ignored other sources of errors like those that might affect reddening or distance values .",
    "a @xmath22 error in the adopted @xmath14 values may lead to @xmath23 in both filters which in turn gives @xmath24 or @xmath25-v)\\sim0.15 $ ] for the most reddened clusters in our sample , such as ngc  6342 or palomar 11 .",
    "some of the clusters in our sample may be affected also by differential reddening ( see the case of ngc  6342 ; alonso - garcia et al .",
    "the impact of extinction variations was checked by means of synthetic experiments .",
    "we simulated a cluster of radius @xmath26 populated by 10,000 stars , all having the same observed magnitude in the three filters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath20 ) ; we also assumed a mean @xmath27 .",
    "we then considered 10 circular areas of radius @xmath28 located at randomly extracted positions within the cluster , and we increased by 0.2 the color excess of all the stars falling within these areas ; analogously , we considered 10 additional similar areas and we decreased by 0.2 the color excess of their stars : we therefore simulated a cluster with mean @xmath27 , containing 10 bubbles with @xmath29 and 10 regions with @xmath30 ( this corresponds to a differential reddening of amplitude @xmath31 , as observed in ngc  6342 by alonso - garcia et al .",
    "we performed 1000 random extractions of the positions of these 20 areas , and , for each of them , we computed the integrated magnitudes in every band and compared them to the input values . at the end of the experiments we found that the net color variation due to differential reddening is negligible .",
    "the largest effects ( @xmath32 mag ) is found for the @xmath2 and @xmath33 colors .",
    "a comparison between the integrated magnitudes obtained with the two methods is shown in figure  [ figcomp ] .",
    "the top panel shows that for most of the clusters there is a very good agreement between the @xmath0 integrated magnitudes obtained from sbp king fitting and from ap .",
    "most of the scatter ( @xmath34 ) is due to uncertainties in the adopted half - light radii .",
    "three clusters ( marked with black crosses ) are strongly deviant in the @xmath0 panel ( at the top ) .",
    "they are 47  tuc , ngc  1851 and ngc  6864 for which @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "visual examination of the images reveals that the large @xmath37 is due to the presence of very bright stars at @xmath38 .",
    "caution must be paid in these cases , since these objects may be cluster members as for the case of 47  tuc ( dixon et al .",
    "1995 ) or non - members as for ngc  1851 ( wallerstein et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the middle panel of figure  [ figcomp ] ,",
    "the @xmath1 integrated magnitudes are compared .",
    "the average difference is essentially zero ( with @xmath39 ) and in this case the outliers are only ngc  1851 and ngc  6864 ( @xmath40 ) . the bottom panel shows the differences in the @xmath41 colors computed with the two approaches as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "good agreement is found also in this case ( @xmath43 ) .    as discussed above ,",
    "magnitudes based on sbp fitting are robust against stochastic effects due to the presence of a few very bright stars .",
    "this is especially important in the @xmath0 , where uv - bright objects such as post - agb and agb - manqu stars are known to yield an important contribution to integrated light ( e.g. , paper i ) thus significantly affecting the integrated colors of not resolved stellar populations ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "however in the present work we focus mainly on clusters global properties which are more likely traced by the bulk of hot stars .",
    "therefore , in the following analysis we adopt sbp colors , with the exception of the six clusters that could not be properly fitted by king models .",
    "a number of hb morphology classifications have been proposed over the decades .",
    "we analyze here the behavior of uv colors as a function of the most important hb parameters .",
    "perhaps the most commonly used is @xmath44 introduced by lee , demarque , and zinn ( 1994 ) , where @xmath20 is the number of variables , and @xmath45 and @xmath26 are the numbers of hb stars blue - ward and red - ward of the instability strip . in the leftmost panels of figure  [ multi ]",
    "the uv colors are shown as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "the large number of clusters with @xmath47 simply reflects our target selection as most clusters with red hbs are located at low galactic latitude .",
    "the wide range of colors at any given value of @xmath46 arises because there is a large variety of hb morphologies even among the subset of clusters with predominantly blue hbs .",
    "the @xmath46 parameter is insensitive to the details of the color distribution of stars bluer than the rr lyrae .",
    "the same applies to other hb morphology parameters defined on the basis of optical cmds .",
    "some clusters with bimodal hbs , like ngc  2808 ( plotted as a gray triangle ) and ngc  1851 ( plotted as a gray square ) , have an @xmath46 value that ranks them among clusters with reddish hbs , yet they are `` hot '' in the uv .    we have also compared our uv colors with the hb parameter @xmath48 defined by buonanno et al .",
    "( 1993 ; 1997 ) , where b2 is the number of stars bluer than @xmath49 ( see also catelan 2009 ) .",
    "data have been taken from buonanno et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and preston et al .",
    "this parameter is expected to correlate more clearly with uv colors , since it is able to remove the degeneracy which characterizes hbr for clusters with extended blue hbs .",
    "in fact we find that both in @xmath41 and @xmath50 there is a clear trend for clusters with @xmath51 , in agreement with findings by catelan 2009 and theoretical expectations ( landsman et al .",
    ". clusters with @xmath52 are those in the `` bimodal hb '' zone ( catelan 2009 ) . in this region in fact , we find ngc 1851 and ngc 2808 , as well as other clusters with a clear bimodal hb like ngc 6864 ( m75 ) and ngc 7006 , or with a more populous red hb and a sparsely populated blue hb as ngc  1261 and ngc  362 . in the latter case",
    "the extension to the blue of the hb may be actually due to contamination by background stars belonging to the small magellanic clouds .",
    "a spearman correlation rank test gives probabilities larger than @xmath53 for correlations with both @xmath41 and @xmath54 . in the @xmath55",
    "the correlation is less clear , in particular if bimodal clusters are not considered . in this case",
    "the spearman test gives a probability p@xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath48 parameter is more efficient than @xmath46 in characterizing extended blue hbs .",
    "thus , in general , it would be preferable .",
    "however we stress that @xmath48 may suffer of the same limitations as @xmath46 since it is defined and measured in optical cmds where star counts along the extreme hb blue tails could be significantly incomplete .",
    "we therefore encourage the definition of similar quantities based on a proper combination of uv and optical bands .",
    "@xcite defined several parameters describing hb blue tails ( bts ) using photometry in the optical bands . in principle , their parameter l@xmath57 describing the length of bts should correlate well with the uv light output of gcs .",
    "however , as shown in the third column of panels in figure  [ multi ] , there is no obvious correlation .",
    "the data used by @xcite were not uniform and in a few cases they were based on cmds dating back to the 1960 s . in many cases the cmds were not deep enough to show bts that we now know to exist .",
    "this has also been noticed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite included bts in their analysis of hb morphology .",
    "they used a homogeneous deep hst survey made in the @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( roughly @xmath45 and @xmath20 ) filters .",
    "they measured the length of bts in terms of the maximum effective temperature  reached by the hb : the values of   were obtained by comparing in the cmds the observed bts with theoretical hb models .",
    "however , the optical plane is not ideal for determination of the temperatures of the hottest stars . for this reason",
    ", this parameter should be considered as a lower limit of the real hb extension , especially for the most extended bts where the hb may be truncated in optical cmds .",
    "indeed , incompleteness may strongly affect clusters with a population of very hot hb stars like the blue hook stars .",
    "these objects have been suggested to be stars which experienced the helium - flash at high effective temperatures ( see for example moehler et al .",
    "2004 ; busso et al .",
    "2007 ; rood et al .",
    "2008 ; cassisi et al .",
    "2009 ; brown et al . 2010 ; dalessandro et al . 2011 ; brown et al.2012 ) or stars with an extremely large helium mass fraction ( @xmath60 ; dantona et al .",
    "however even in those cases in which incompleteness does not represent a limit , optical photometry still remains a poor measure of  for extremely hot stars .",
    "in fact , as shown for example in dalessandro et al .",
    "( 2011 ) in the case of ngc  2808 , the value of @xmath61 by @xcite is underestimated by @xmath62k .",
    "however even with this limitation ,  is a useful parameter describing the uv bright population of gcs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fourth column of panels in figure  [ multi ] show the uv colors as a function of  .",
    "there is an obvious correlation in the case of colors involving @xmath0 magnitudes , not so much in the case of @xmath55 .",
    "this is expected , since nuv magnitudes are less sensitive than fuv to the  of the hottest stars .",
    "a spearman test gives probabilities larger than @xmath63 for correlations with both @xmath41 and @xmath54 , and @xmath64 for the correlation with @xmath55 .",
    "all the clusters with @xmath65 ( roughly 1/3 of the sample ) have approximately the same @xmath41 color .",
    "there is another group of clusters with @xmath66 with a wide range of @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , although the correlation between this parameter and integrated color is statistically robust for colors involving @xmath0 magnitudes , the detailed dependence of integrated color on hb morphology as defined by this parameters seems not to be monotonic .",
    "@xcite introduced the parameter  to describe hb morphology .",
    "it is defined as the difference in the median colors of the hb and the red giant branch ( rgb ) at the level of the hb , and it is derived from a homogeneous , deep hst acs survey in f606w and f814w ( roughly @xmath67 ) . however , since bts are almost vertical in the @xmath68 cmds , we might expect that  has problems similar to @xmath46 in characterizing the gc uv light .",
    "the rightmost column in figure  [ multi ] shows the uv colors as a function of .",
    "the correlations are good , in a statistical sense : probabilities larger than @xmath63 are found for @xmath41 and @xmath54 colors , while @xmath69 probability is obtained for a correlation with @xmath55 .",
    "however the bulk of the sample is bunched up to the lower right corner of the plots .",
    "this is because , unsurprisingly , a parameter based on red optical colors distinguishes clusters with relatively red hbs from their blue counterparts , but provides very poor discrimination between clusters with blue and extremely blue hb morphologies .      in order to investigate any possible link between the uv colors and chemical compositions of the milky way gcs",
    ", we adopted the  values quoted by carretta et al .",
    "( 2009b ) . for terzan  8 , which is not in their sample , we used the equation listed by carretta et al .",
    "( 2009b ) to convert  values from zinn & west ( 1984 ) to their metallicity scale .",
    "the uv colors derived from sbp fitting are plotted as a function of metallicity in figure  [ met ] .",
    "first focusing on the top panel of figure  [ met ] , one can see that , for the gcs included in this sample , @xmath55 decreases by about 2 magnitudes as  decreases from @xmath70 -0.7 to @xmath70 1.5 . for smaller values of",
    ", @xmath55 is roughly constant , or perhaps increases slightly as  decreases .",
    "this clear , although non - monotonic , trend of @xmath55 with metallicity is confirmed by a spearman correlation rank test , according to which the probability of a correlation is 99.99% ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "even after removing the most metal - rich clusters ( @xmath72 ) the probability of correlation remains significant at more than @xmath73 . by removing from the sample the most metal - poor clusters ( @xmath74 ) the probability for a correlation actually increases .",
    "the more restrictive non - parametric kendall rank correlation test also shows that there is a strong and positive correlation between @xmath55 and with a significance of @xmath75 .",
    "the integrated @xmath1 radiation from ggcs is dominated by blue hb stars but it has some contribution also from turnoff and blue stragglers stars ( see for example figure  1 in ferraro et al .",
    "the overall trend of @xmath55 as a function of metallicity seen on the top panel of figure  [ met ] is therefore in line with expectations from standard stellar evolution theory , as hb and turnoff stars in more metal - rich clusters are expected to be cooler and redder .",
    "this expectation was also confirmed by observations collected with ans , oao , and uit , as presented by dor95 .",
    "metallicity , however , is only one of the parameters determining the color distribution of hb stars .",
    "at least one _ second parameter _ is known to affect the color of the hb in gcs , and it can be recognized in the large spread in color for @xmath76 [ fe / h ] @xmath77 , where clusters with similar  can have @xmath55 differing by as much as @xmath70 1.5 mag . the nature of this second parameter has been the subject of debate for several decades now , with candidates such as he abundance , age , mass loss , binarity , rotation , among others , being suggested in the past to explain the effect ( for a review , see catelan 2009 ) .",
    "recently dotter et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and gratton et al . (",
    "2010 ) have particularly emphasized the role of age and they also stressed on the necessity of even a third parameter ( the central luminosity density for the first and the he abundance for the second ) .",
    "interpretation of the dependence of colors involving @xmath0 magnitudes as a function of  requires a little more care . at first glance",
    ", the middle and bottom panels of figure  [ met ] show a less clear correlation between color and .",
    "the bottom panel in particular looks like a scatter plot .",
    "it is true , though , that , @xmath54 varies by almost 5 magnitudes . indeed",
    ", a spearman test gives a probability @xmath78 ( corresponding to @xmath79 ) that @xmath54 is correlated with metallicity .",
    "the kendall test gives correlation probability of @xmath80 .",
    "the probability drops to @xmath81 if the most metal - rich clusters are excluded from the analysis . at face value , therefore , @xmath54 correlates with  in a similar way as @xmath55 , although in a less strong or noisier fashion .    in summary ,",
    "then , one finds that the behavior of ggcs in the @xmath54  and @xmath55  planes is essentially the same . on both planes ,",
    "three sub - families of clusters can be recognized : 1 ) ggcs with @xmath82 , which are predominantly red ; 2 ) ggcs with @xmath83 @xmath84 , the `` second parameter region '' ( see also fusi pecci et al .",
    "1993 ) , where ggcs have a wide range of colors , about @xmath85 mag in @xmath55 and @xmath86 mag in @xmath54 ; and 3 ) ggcs with @xmath87 , which are all blue .",
    "it is worth noticing that , intermediate - metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath88 ) clusters are the bluest in the three colors combinations .",
    "this was also highlighted by dor95 .",
    "the extension of their hbs ( see paper i ) is compatible with their integrated colors . on average , the metal - poor ( @xmath89 ) gcs have redder hbs than the intermediate ones .",
    "this appears to contradict expectations based on the notion that metallicity is the _",
    "first parameter_. some authors interpreted this discrepancy invoking age differences among clusters .",
    "however dotter ( 2008 ) was able to account for this behavior without invoking age differences , by using synthetic hb models and simple assumptions about the mass - loss / metallicity relation .",
    "careful inspection of the @xmath41 or @xmath54 _ vs _  plots in figure  [ met ] clearly reveals that the color spread at @xmath74 is due to a subset of clusters ( plotted as asterisks ) , which are systematically redder by @xmath70 1.5 and 1.0 mag in @xmath41 and @xmath54 , respectively , than the other gcs in the same metallicity regime .",
    "this is also confirmed if colors obtained with ap are used instead of those derived from sbp fitting .",
    "likewise , adopting the zinn & west ( 1984 ) metallicity scale or metallicity values by carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) does not affect the general behavior , even though minor differences in a cluster - to - cluster comparison can obviously come out .",
    "interestingly these clusters ( ngc  4590 , ngc  5053 , ngc  5466 , arp  2 and terzan  8) are potentially connected with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream ( dinescu et al . 1999 ,",
    "palma et al .",
    "2002 , bellazzini et al .",
    "2003 , law & majewski 2010 ) , and thus may have an extra - galactic origin .",
    "we stress that all these clusters have been suggested to be connected to the sagittarius stream by at least two different authors .",
    "the other candidate sagittarius gc is the relatively metal - rich ( [ fe / h]=@xmath90 ) palomar  12 , for which we were not able to get @xmath0 magnitude ( see section  3.1 ) . among the clusters considered here ,",
    "the classification of ngc 4590 is the most uncertain . according to its metallicity , hb morphology and proper motions ( smith et al . 1998 ; dinescu et al . 1999 ; palma et al .",
    "2002 ) it is likely associated with the sgr stream , although forbes & bridges ( 2010 ) suggest that it is connected to the canis major dwarf . in any case",
    ", the extragalactic origin seems to be well established .    to explore the significance and meaning of this behavior we used the photometric catalogs presented in paper i to understand how the differences in the integrated colors relate to differences in the cluster cmds .",
    "we picked two clusters associated with the sagittarius stream , and compared them with ggcs of similar metallicity ( figure  [ sgr_cmd ] ) .",
    "the photometric catalogs have been corrected by distance modulus and reddening values reported by h10 , as done in paper i. the hbs of the stream clusters are homogeneously populated in color and magnitude .",
    "in contrast , the ggcs show an obvious increase of star density towards higher temperatures and bluer colors . in these clusters",
    "the median color of hb stars is bluer by @xmath91 .",
    "this difference is qualitatively consistent with the measured discrepancy between the integrated colors .",
    "the hb star distributions differences in the galex cmds are in agreement with results from optical high - resolution surveys ( see dotter et al .",
    "2010 for example ) .",
    "the sagittarius gcs do not show any systematic trend in the @xmath55 _ vs _ [ fe / h ] diagram .",
    "more details about the morphology of their hbs will be presented in paper iii ( r. t. rood .",
    "2012 in preparation ) .",
    "we checked also for possible differences in relative ages .",
    "for this , we used two independent papers ( salaris & weiss 2002 , and dotter et al .",
    "2010 ) containing age estimates for a large sample of gcs including most of our targets .",
    "even though some systematic differences are present between the two age scales , within the uncertainties the clusters connected with the sagittarius stream are classified in both cases as old and coeval with genuine ggcs in the same metallicity regime , with the only exception of pal  12 which is @xmath92 gyr younger .",
    "in particular , the four sagittarius old clusters in common with salaris & weiss ( 2002 ; terzan  8 has not been analyzed by the authors ) have an average age of @xmath93 gyr which is fully compatible with the estimates for ggcs . in dotter",
    "et al . ( 2010 ) the differences between the galactic and the sagittarius gcs are of the order of @xmath94 gyr .",
    "in addition , recent high resolution spectroscopic analysis ( carretta et al . 2010 ) showed that , on average , the sagittarius clusters in our sample share the same @xmath95-elements abundances with their galactic twins .",
    "we used the _ r-parameter _ reported by gratton et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to highlight possible differences .",
    "r-parameter _ is defined as the ratio between the number of hb stars and that of rgbs brighter than the level corresponding to @xmath96 .",
    "this quantity is an indirect estimate of @xmath97 ( see cassisi et al .",
    "2003 ; salaris et al .",
    "2004 ) , since the hb luminosity , as well as the rgb and hb lifetimes , depends on the he content .",
    "however for this comparison we preferred to use only the _ r-parameter _ in order to avoid uncertainties that may come from the calibrations used to derive helium abundances ( @xmath98 ) from it .",
    "three ( ngc  4590 , ngc  5053 and ngc  5466 ) out of the five sagittarius clusters have been studied by gratton et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that these clusters have _ r _ values smaller than other clusters with similar metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath99 . given the statistical uncertainties of these measurements , the difference in _",
    "r _ between any two given clusters is somewhat uncertain .",
    "therefore we performed a t - test to check the significance of the difference between the mean values of the two distributions .",
    "we find that for the clusters potentially connected with the sgr stream @xmath100 while for ggcs @xmath101 .",
    "the t - test gives a probability p@xmath102 that they are different .",
    "we stress that it is not possible to make a final statement about this point .",
    "in fact this simple analysis suffers of low number statistics and incompleteness of our sample .",
    "moreover the significance of the result may depend on the clusters considered to be connected with sagittarius .",
    "however it emerges that clusters connected with sagittarius share , on average , the same properties as the genuine ggcs , except for the _ r-parameter_. this difference might be an indication that those clusters have lower he abundances than ggcs in the same metallicity regime , and this is likely the main responsible of the differences in fuv integrated colors . further analysis and estimates of the _ r-parameter _ for the other clusters possibly associated with sagittarius",
    "are highly desirable and could provide stronger constraints on this problem .      a number of authors ( lee et al . 2002 , sohn et al . 2006 , rey et al .",
    "2007 ) made use of uv integrated colors to investigate age trends in the gc systems of the milky way ( by using oao  2 , ans and uit data ) , as well as of m31 and m87 .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and yi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argued that with a proper modeling of the hb contribution to uv bands , the @xmath2 could be a good age tracer of relatively old stellar populations .",
    "the basic assumption is that the hb morphology is driven by metallicity and age .",
    "of course a number of uncertainties may arise because of the treatment of mass loss along the upper rgb , or the presence of hot hb stars , like ehb , which are not included in these models .",
    "however under this assumption , both lee et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and rey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) were able to reproduce the uv color _ vs _ metallicity distribution of milky way and m31 gcs .",

    "2006 ) were unable to find an acceptable match between their data for the m87 gcs and the models of lee et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which required unphysically old ages ( @xmath103 ) to reproduce the observed color distributions .",
    "taking advantage of our large and homogeneous sample and the high photometric accuracy of our data , in figure  [ met_mod ] we compare the @xmath54-[fe / h ] distribution observed in our gc sample , with the theoretical models of lee et al .",

    "the color - metallicity distribution of ggcs is consistent with ages @xmath104 gyr , in broad agreement with the results obtained from fitting theoretical isochrones to the turnoff or the white dwarf cooling sequences ( e.g. , salaris & weiss 2002 ; dotter et al .",
    "it is worth noticing that the three clusters that appear as the `` youngest '' ( @xmath105 gyr ) , according to the lee et al .",
    "2002 models , are those connected with the sagittarius stream ( ngc  4590 , ngc  5053 and ngc  5466 ) . as discussed above , however , they most likely are old and coeval with those in the same metallicity range , thus indicating that caution must be used to derive ages from this color - metallicity plane ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "1993 ) , since other parameters play a role in distributing clusters in this diagram .",
    "the helium content certainly is one of these parameters ( see for example sohn et al .",
    "2006 , kaviraj et al .",
    "2007 , chung et al . 2011 ) .",

    "they suggest , in fact , that he - rich sub - populations in gcs could be able to reproduce the `` uv - upturn '' observed in elliptical galaxies . to check the impact of multiple populations on the observed colors we used the helium fractions @xmath106 derived by the _ r-parameter _ by gratton et al .",

    " hb second parameter ",
    "problem is postponed to paper iii , here we briefly consider how uv integrated colors vary with clusters parameters previously suggested to be connected with the presence of long hb bts .",
    "@xcite suggested that bts are related to central density and concentration , and that stellar interactions somehow enhanced mass loss .",
    "@xcite also suggested that the third parameter acting in modeling the hb morphologies is somehow related to the chance of interactions between stars .",
    "figure  [ concentration ] shows the galex colors plotted as a function of concentration @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the king model core radius and @xmath111 is the tidal radius .",
    "while the sample as a whole shows no significant correlation , the massive cluster ( @xmath112 ) colors are well correlated with @xmath113 , moving to the redder ( or cooler ) colors as the concentration increases .",

    "( 2010 ) could not be performed , since in their analysis the authors removed the effects of metallicity and age from their parameter  .",
    "we defer to paper iii for a detailed and comparative analysis .",
    "@xcite have used galex to observe gcs in m31 . the authors ( kang et al . 2011 ) have recently published an updated catalog with a larger sample of clusters and reviewed reddening values . in figure  [ m31comp ]",
    "we compare our results with data for m31 clusters classified as `` old '' ( @xmath116 ) by caldwell et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and we restrict the sample to clusters with @xmath117 , in order to avoid clusters with high reddening uncertainties . + m31 seems to show a lack of red clusters with respect to the galaxy .",
    "however , this is likely due to the limited sensitivity of galex to detect relatively red populations in distant systems ( see discussion in rey et .",
    "al . 2007 ) .",
    "hence for the comparison we focus on the bluest systems , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which , for the ggcs , correspond to a metallicity range @xmath121 . in this metallicity regime",
    "the distributions in the milky way and in m31 are quite similar .",
    "the bluest colors reached are essentially the same , and the distributions show little variations with metallicity .",
    "three m31 clusters lie almost in the same region as gcs connected with the sagittarius dwarf in the @xmath54-[fe / h ] plane .",
    "they are g  327 , b  366 and interestingly b  009 that is known to be projected against the dwarf spheroidal galaxy ngc  205 .",

    "the case is very different at higher metallicity , @xmath122 . in the milky way sample there are only red ggcs , while in m31 there are many blue gcs .",
    "+ in order to make the comparison with m31 gcs as complete as possible , we have supplemented our galex sample with 12 additional ggcs from dor95 , not observed by galex because of the target selection limitations discussed in section 2 .",
    "first , we converted the ans and oao  2 magnitudes from the stmag to the abmag system and we checked that no systematic color offsets or trends are present for the ( 15 ) gcs in common .",

    ". why would that be the case ?",
    "as shown in figure  [ m31comp ] roughly half of the blue , metal - rich m31 gcs are indeed quite massive ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "hence , the relative paucity of hot , metal - rich gcs in the milky way could be due in part ( but only in part ) to the fact that there are only two massive metal - rich clusters in our supplemented sample .",
    "it is also possible that many ggcs with high metallicity and a blue hb are missed because of their location towards highly extinguished regions of the galaxy .",
    "+ we also compare ggc colors measured with galex with those obtained for the giant elliptical galaxy m87 using hst stis images ( sohn et al .",

    "as noted above , the age - metallicity grid of theoretical predictions provides realistic ages for the m87 gcs only when the effect of helium is taken into account ( see figure 2 in chung et al .",

    "2007 ) .    from the comparison between ggcs and those belonging to three other galaxies ( the sagittarius dwarf , m31 and m87 )",

    "in fact the clusters associated with the sagittarius dwarf are on average redder than the mw ones , the m31 clusters have colors which are comparable to those of the ggcs , while the m87 star systems are bluer .",
    "we note that there may be a possible trend between the mass of the host galaxy and the color distribution of its globulars , in the sense that the higher is the galaxy mass , the bluer are the gc uv colors .",
    "in fact m87 ( with the bluer systems ) is a super - giant elliptical that is about two orders of magnitude more massive than the milky way , while sagittarius ( @xmath127 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and the galaxy ( @xmath129 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) representing intermediate cases .",
    "we argued that most of the observed differences between colors involving the @xmath0 band are explainable invoking different helium contents .",
    "this would lead us to speculatively think that galaxies with larger masses may have , on average , more he - rich populations . in that case",
    ", he abundance differences could be a by - product of chemical evolution differences , in some way connected to the mass of the host galaxy .",
    "this could be also connected with the formation and dynamical history of clusters in galaxies with different masses , as suggested by valcarce & catelan ( 2011 ) . in particular",
    "they argue that clusters hosted by more massive galaxies are more likely to undergo a more complex history of star formation thus having a larger spread in stellar populations properties .",
    "as part of a project aimed at studying the properties of hot stellar populations in the milky way gcs ( see paper i ) , we have presented uv integrated colors obtained with galex for 44 clusters spanning a wide range of metallicities ( @xmath130 ) , hb morphologies , structural and dynamical parameters .",

    "the combinations of colors involving the @xmath0 appear more scattered , but a reasonable and similar correlation with metallicity at ( @xmath135 level ) has been also found in these cases . all the clusters suspected to be connected with the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal ( ngc  4590 , ngc  5053 , ngc  5466 , arp  2 and terzan  8) are typically @xmath136mag redder in @xmath0 colors than systems with similar iron content .",

    "studies from different groups suggest that sagittarius clusters and their galactic counterparts are coeval , while ggcs are on average more he - rich than the sagittarius sub - set .",

    "may be to assumptions about helium abundance , we compared our colors with evolutionary models of ssp by lee et al .",
    "the color - metallicity distribution of ggcs can be reproduced by assuming an average age of @xmath137 gyr , with a spread of about @xmath138 .",
    "alternatively , in the framework in which some gcs have experienced self - enrichment from material ejected from agbs or fast - rotating massive stars ( ventura & dantona 2008 ; decressin et al . 2007 ) , the color spread is consistent with different he content . in particular , we show that an overabundance of helium ( @xmath139 ) can mimic an age difference @xmath140 .",
    "the uv colors of ggcs are consistent with those obtained by galex for m31 clusters ( rey et al . 2007 ; kang et al . 2011 ) , at least in the intermediate / low metallicity regime . at @xmath122 , m31 gcs",

    "<S> we present ultraviolet ( uv ) integrated colors of 44 galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) observed with the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands . </S>",
    "<S> this data - base is the largest homogeneous catalog of uv colors ever published for stellar systems in our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the proximity of ggcs makes it possible to resolve many individual stars even with the somewhat low spatial resolution of galex . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to determine how the integrated uv colors are driven by hot stellar populations , primarily horizontal branch stars and their progeny . </S>",
    "<S> the uv colors are found to be correlated with various parameters commonly used to define the horizontal branch morphology . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate how the uv colors vary with parameters like metallicity , age , helium abundance and concentration . </S>",
    "<S> we find for the first time that gcs associated with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy have @xmath2 colors systematically redder than ggcs with the same metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we speculate about the presence of an interesting trend , suggesting that the uv color of gcs may be correlated with the mass of the host galaxy , in the sense that more massive galaxies possess bluer clusters . </S>"
