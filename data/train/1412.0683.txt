    "loss of stability of power systems usually results in some of the most dramatic scenarios of power system failure and has played an important role in most of the recent blackout .",
    "the dynamic of response of loads affects the voltage and to lesser extend angular stability in most important way @xcite .",
    "the loads affect the overall system behavior and may lead to loss of stability because of insufficient damping @xcite .",
    "typically the loss of stability of the system occurs via hopf bifurcation @xcite , when some part of the upper branch of the nose curve becomes unstable .",
    "the load response was shown to play a major role in this scenario for example in @xcite .",
    "hereafter , whenever we mention stability , we mean small - disturbance stability that associates with a particular operating point .",
    "loads , by definition , represent an aggregate of hundreds or thousands of individual devices such as motors , lighting , and electrical appliances @xcite .",
    "load modeling has been a subject of intensive research for several decades @xcite ; however , it is still a rather open subject .",
    "even though some certain types of loads such as aluminum or steel plant , and pumped hydroelectric storage are considered as well - identified ones @xcite ; due to its natural complexity and uncertainty , load dynamics , in general , may be never known completely in operational planning , operation , and control @xcite .",
    "the lack of knowledge about the dynamic characteristic of each individual component due to poor measurements , modeling , and exchange information , as well as the uncertainties in components / customers behaviors via switching events contribute to load uncertainties .",
    "hence , loads are the main source of uncertainty @xcite that undermines the accuracy of the power dynamic models used by system operators all over the world .",
    "incorporation of the uncertainty into existing models is essential for improving the system security usually defined as the ability of the system to withstand credible disturbances / contingencies while maintaining power delivery services continuity @xcite .",
    "the future power systems will likely be exposed to higher levels of overall stress and complexity due to penetration of renewable generators , and more intelligent loads , deregulation of the system , and introduction of short - time scale power markets .",
    "secure operation of these systems will necessarily require the operator to track the voltage stability boundary with new generation of security assessment tools providing comprehensive , fast and accurate assessment @xcite .",
    "this work addressed the need in  robust \" security assessment tools that can provide security guarantees even in the presence of modeling uncertainty .    in @xcite ,",
    "several techniques were developed that rely on transversality conditions for quantifying the distance to various types of bifurcation including hopf bifurcation in multidimensional parameter space .",
    "these techniques ensure robust stability of the equilibrium associated with nominal parameter @xmath0 . although they could be naturally extended to a uncertainty in small subspace of parameters , there extension to situations when the space of uncertain parameters has high dimension . in this paper",
    ", we provide robust stability certificate in multidimensional space of certain system parameters . unlike the works mentioned above we do without tracking the most dangerous direction ,",
    "rather we indicate whether such directions exist or not .",
    "hence , we do not attempt to find the unstable points associated with some certain critical parameters .",
    "the existence of robust stability certificate and whole region of operating points that are certified to be robust stable provides new practical alternatives for dealing with load dynamics uncertainty .",
    "it has been noted in @xcite that traditional `` voltage collapse '' instability is not affected by the load dynamics as it corresponds to saddle - node bifurcation , where the equilibrium point disappears altogether . at the same time for the more common hopf bifurcation",
    "it was argued in @xcite that sensitivity analysis of the system trajectories may provide enough information to assess the risks associated with common disturbances .",
    "moreover , whenever the system operates in the robust stability regime , the stability can be certified even without knowing the dynamic characteristics of the load altogether .",
    "the stability of the system can be certified simply by analyzing the static characteristics of the loads in combination with well - understood dynamic models of generators . in this sense",
    ", we argue that accurate modeling of the loads is essential only when the system operates in the intermediate regimes of the nose curves or the pv curves , between the robust stability region and the saddle - node bifurcation on the nose tip .",
    "the structure of the paper and the main contributions are summarized below . after introducing our modeling assumptions in [ sec : loadmodeling ] we derive the novel robust stability criterion in section [ sec : robuststability ] .",
    "then , we propose a practical algorithm rsa for robust stability certification . in section [ sec : simulation ] we perform various simulations with several test cases from @xmath1-bus system to wscc @xmath2-machine , @xmath3-bus system and the ieee @xmath4-bus new england system to illustrate the concept of robust stability and rsa .",
    "the dynamic simulations are implemented in systemmodeler @xmath5 and the computations are performed in mathematica @xmath6 and with the help of cvx program , a package for convex programming . then in section [ sec : applications ] we discuss the proposed applications of the algorithm , and possible extensions to other kinds of uncertainty . finally , the non - certified robust stability region is discussed in section [ sec : nonrobust ] .",
    "while the power system operates in stressed heavily loaded regime it may be prone to subject to voltage stability problems . the secure operating region is confined by voltage stability boundary . as a common practice ,",
    "static voltage stability criteria is widely used by system operators @xcite . moreover , it has been argued that static analysis is preferred over dynamic approach @xcite . at the same time",
    "it has been reported in many works that hopf bifurcation may destabilize the system before it reaches the static stability limits @xcite .        under some particular conditions , hopf bifurcation may not occur @xcite but typically , hopf bifurcation determines the stability margins of most common systems @xcite when the system exhibits hopf bifurcation before it reaches the saddle - node bifurcation point or the tip of the nose curve .",
    "this situation can happen in the quasi - stable hopf bifurcation region shown in figure [ fig : qualhopf ] .",
    "the term quasi - stability used in power engineering is related to the oscillatory behavior of the system that is observed after the occurrence hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "detecting the loadability limits associated with the bifurcation is a much more complicated problem in comparison to the static stability analysis associated with the saddle - node bifurcation @xcite",
    ". some realistic examples of finding hopf bifurcation point can be found in @xcite and related works . in this context , the key contribution of this work is an alternative approach based on robust stability . whenever the robust criterion criterion is satisfied , the system is mathematically guaranteed that hopf bifurcation can not occur .      the stability of any operating point and the position of the hopf bifurcation on the nose curve depends on the dynamical behavior of loads on individual buses .",
    "traditional models of load dynamics are based on combination of differential and algebraic equations for the load state . in steady state",
    "the loads can be characterized by their static characteristics @xmath7 and @xmath8 which describe the dependence of the active and reactive power consumption levels @xmath9 on the load bus voltage level @xmath10 and system frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamic state of the loads is typically characterized by single state variable @xmath12 that represents the internal state of the system , for example the average slip of the induction motors .",
    "whenever the composition of the loads on a single bus is highly heterogeneous , it may be represented by a parallel interconnection of several components characterized by different models . at any moment of time the load consuming active power @xmath13 and reactive power @xmath14 can be characterized by the effective conductance @xmath15 and susceptance @xmath16 .",
    "the first order dynamic model for the conductance representing the dynamics of the internal state of the load can be than written in a general form as : @xmath17 the right hand side of this equation is not arbitrary and should have the equilibrium point corresponding to the steady state characteristic of the load .",
    "hence whenever the active power consumption is equal to steady rate , so @xmath18 , the right hand side of should vanish , so @xmath19 .",
    "any function @xmath20 that satisfies this relation can be rewritten as @xmath21 . in this form ,",
    "the factor @xmath22 generally depends on voltage and frequency and can be interpreted as instant relaxation rate of the load . whenever the load is stable when connected to an infinite slack bus , the factor @xmath22",
    "can be trivially shown to be positive , so @xmath23 . the same mathematical form and analysis also apply to the load susceptance .",
    "this discussion allows us to conclude that for the purposes of small - signal stability studies the first order models of the loads can be represented as @xmath24 here the index @xmath25 runs over all load buses in the system , the factors @xmath26 , @xmath27 represent the uncertainties in the dynamic models , that can be also interpreted as relaxation time . the factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the voltage dependent static characteristic of the loads .",
    "this type of load model is also introduced in @xcite , typically for thermostatic loads .",
    "however as we have argued in @xcite this model can naturally be used to represent the standard models for thermostatically controlled loads , induction motors , power electronic converters , aggregate effects of otherwise unmodelled distribution load tap changer ( ltc ) transformers etc .",
    "the static loads can be also naturally modeled within this framework by taking the limit @xmath30 .",
    "obviously , the range of time constants is wide , ranging is from cycles to minutes and can introduce a lot of uncertainty in the modeling process .",
    "we finish this section by comparing the model to the two other classical load models .",
    "equations are just another form of the traditional dynamic load models introduced originally in @xcite : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the instantaneous power , that is denoted by @xmath33 in our notations and @xmath10 is the bus voltage magnitude , referred to as @xmath34 in equations .",
    "the more specific form of these equations , known as exponential recovery model was introduced in @xcite : @xmath35 we can recover the model ( [ eq : generalform ] ) from equation ( [ eq : geqsimple ] ) by taking the derivative of @xmath36 .",
    "this results in the following expression : @xmath37    another equivalent model was introduced in @xcite and @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath12 is the state ; subscript @xmath39 and @xmath40 indicate steady state and transient values , respectively ; @xmath41 , @xmath42 ; @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "this model is equivalent to , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 when @xmath47 .",
    "the proposed load model can naturally represent the most common types of loads , such as induction motors , thermostatically controlled loads .",
    "hence , we believe that the form of the load model is rather general and can be used in a variety of practically relevant problems .",
    "for example , below we show , how the induction motor model can be embedded in our generic modeling framework .",
    "the induction motor depicted in figure [ fig : motor ] can be described as @xcite :    @xmath48    where @xmath39 is the motor slip , @xmath49 is the base frequency , @xmath50 is the rotor moment of inertia , @xmath51 is the mechanical power , and @xmath32 is the electric power given by @xmath52 since @xmath53 , from ( [ eq : motoractivepower ] ) , we can represent the motor as the dynamic inductance with @xmath54    in normal operating regime , this relation can be also reversed so that @xmath55 .",
    "differentiation of the two sides of ( [ eq : motorys ] ) with respect to time yields the following expression : @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "as long as @xmath39 can be expressed in terms of @xmath58 we reproduce the general form ( [ eq : abstract ] ) .",
    "similar approach can be applied to most of the other types of loads , like thermostatically controlled loads , static loads behind under - load tap changers ( ultcs ) , and certainly the static loads which are described in more detail in appendix [ app : lm ] .    from ( [ eq : motorys ] ) and ( [ eq : motordotg ] ) , the induction motor load can be modeled in the form of ( [ eq : abstract ] ) .",
    "more importantly , the proposed dynamic load model not only is convenient for static analysis even in non - conventional power flow regime @xcite but also satisfies all fundamental requirements for load models in voltage stability studies which are mentioned in @xcite .",
    "in this section we address the question of the small - signal stability of an operating point by first reviewing the classical stability criteria applied to the problem of voltage stability of modern power system models in subsection [ sec : linear ] and then introduce the central result of the paper : robust stability criterion in [ sec : robust ] .",
    "most common models of power system dynamics describe the evolution of the power system in terms of a system of nonlinear differential algebraic equations of the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 are vectors representing the state variables , algebraic variables .",
    "the state variables can be naturally decomposed in generator @xmath62 and load states @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 are the total number of states associated with loads and generators , respectively .",
    "moreover , we assume that the subset of algebraic variables @xmath66 represents the bus voltages , including the voltages on load buses .    under the assumptions above it is possible to represent ( [ eq : daes ] ) in terms of @xmath67 and @xmath68 as : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a diagonal matrix with the size of @xmath71 whose diagonal entries are the time constants of corresponding loads as introduced in ; @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the functions associate with the sets of generators and the loads , respectively .",
    "note , that in this representation the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be assumed to be known and all the uncertainty is aggregated in the matrix @xmath70 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable in the situations when the network characteristics are known , generator models are verified and static load characteristics are understood better than their dynamic response which is the case in practical situations .",
    "note , also , that in the equations and there is no direct coupling between the dynamics of generators and loads , as the individual load components interact only indirectly via algebraic bus voltage variables .",
    "small signal stability can be characterized by considering the linearized version of the equations for the deviations of state and algebraic variables from their equilibrium values .",
    "@xmath76 where the subscripts of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath66 indicate the partial derivatives with respect to the corresponding states and variables . away from saddle - node bifurcation",
    "the algebraic variables @xmath77 can be eliminated from yielding @xmath78 @xmath79    this expression can be more conveniently decomposed as @xmath80 in the following form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the identity matrix of size @xmath83 .",
    "the key advantage of this decomposition is the separation of the matrix @xmath84 in an uncertain diagonal matrix @xmath70 and the jacobian matrix @xmath85 that does not depend on the uncertain load time constants , and depends only on the properties of the steady state equilibrium point defined in load and generator variables .",
    "notably , for load models considered in this work the second row depends only on the steady - state behavior of the load , i.e. it can be computed given the load levels and voltage / frequency dependence of the steady - state active and reactive power consumption .",
    "according to the lyapunov direct method , the system described by @xmath86 is stable if and only if there exist a symmetric positive definite matrix @xmath87 such that @xmath88 where superscript @xmath89 is used for transpose operator .",
    "however , existence of a @xmath14 matrix for a given @xmath84 merely implies the system stability for some specific load dynamics . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the concept of robust stability that guarantees the stability of the system stability for any load time constant uncertainty , i.e. any positive definite diagonal matrix @xmath90 .      as discussed previously , in this work , we assume that the operator has reliable information about the generator models and settings , and the corresponding jacobian matrix row @xmath91 is available for analysis . at the same time , we assume that the grid model and all the algebraic equations characterized by @xmath75 are known with high accuracy . for the load model",
    "we assume that the matrices @xmath92 and @xmath93 describing the static characteristics of loads are known with high accuracy , however the matrix @xmath70 representing the dynamic response is not .",
    "the goal of robust stability certificate is to guarantee that the operating point is stable for any positive definite @xmath94 .",
    "it is important to distinguish between two categories of load uncertainties , i.e. load level uncertainty and load dynamic uncertainty .",
    "the former relates to load level fluctuations due to various factors such as individual consumer behavior or variations in the production output of dgs .",
    "this type of uncertainty is considered in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "load dynamic uncertainty concerns the unpredictability of the dynamic response of the load to small fluctuation in voltage and frequency . in this work ,",
    "we only focus on the latter type of uncertainty and do not discuss the uncertainty in load variations assuming that the operating point is known .",
    "however , the regions of robust stability can be also used to account for uncertainty in load consumption levels .",
    "there are many sources of uncertainty in load dynamics .",
    "apart from the natural uncertainty related to composition of power consumption devices , the level of uncertainty may increase dramatically in coming years when more small scale generators , i.e. dgs , are integrated to the systems , especially on the distribution level .",
    "when the penetration level becomes very high the traditional static voltage stability may be insufficient to assess the system security @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the approach proposed in this work is valid , at least for non - synchronous dgs that can be modelled as a negative loads with dynamics in the form of and .    the robust stability criterion developed in the manuscript",
    "is directly linked to the concept of d - stability @xcite that are extended to model the uncertainty in a subset of state variables . in the following theorems",
    "we denote the set of positive definite matrices of size @xmath95 as @xmath96 and set of diagonal positive definite matrices of size @xmath97 as @xmath98 .",
    "the following theorem is central to the robust stability certification of power systems .",
    "assume that there exists block - diagonal positive definite block diagonal matrix @xmath14 , such that @xmath99 with positive definite matrix @xmath100 and diagonal positive definite matrix @xmath101 that satisfies @xmath102 for some @xmath103 .",
    "in this case the system is robust stable , i.e. in other words , for any diagonal @xmath104 there exists @xmath105 such that @xmath106    consider the matrix @xmath107 .",
    "due to block - diagonal structure of @xmath14 we have @xmath108 and at the same time @xmath109 , so @xmath110 .",
    "note , that the condition first reported in the framework of d - stability @xcite only establishes a sufficient criterion for robust stability . to our knowledge",
    "no computationally tractable necessary and sufficient criteria reported for d - stability have been reported in the literature .",
    "the only exception is the set of results on the so - called positive matrices @xcite for which the existence of diagonal lyapunov function is a necessary condition for stability .",
    "positive matrices are characterized by negative off - diagonal components .",
    "the question of whether they can be used to describe power system dynamics is interesting and worth exploring , but is outside of the scope of this study .",
    "the problem of checking whether the block diagonal matrix @xmath14 exists for given @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath70 is easy and can be accomplished by solving the following semi - definite programming ( sdp ) problem .",
    "@xmath113 here the optimization is carried over the matrices @xmath14 with structure defined in .",
    "the condition @xmath114 fixes the overall normalization of the lyapunov function .",
    "whenever the resulting value @xmath115 is positive the system is guaranteed to be robust stable .",
    "the complexity of this procedure is polynomial in the size of the system . in recent years",
    "mathematically similar procedures have been successfully applied in the context of optimal power flow approaches @xcite , and more recently for power system security assessment purposes @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in a number of papers , that even large scale systems admit fast analysis with sdp algorithms @xcite .",
    "however , from , one can see that the proposed robust stability criterion requires the equilibrium to be independent on uncertain parameters , for example the time constants of the loads .",
    "fortunately , the standard control systems in generators and other components normally satisfy this requirement .",
    "this can be seen by looking at the equations for the system equilibrium point , like load flow equations and observe that they do nt depend on the dynamic time constants of governors , avr and loads .    in this work",
    "we illustrate the approach by considering the load dynamic uncertainties . in real power systems ,",
    "the dynamics of generators and flexible ac transmission systems ( facts ) devices are also the sources of uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the generators and the system uncertainties cause much difficult in designing effective power system stabilizer ( pss ) and other controllers @xcite . as mentioned before ,",
    "as long as these uncertainties do not alter the system equilibrium , the proposed robust stability criterion can be applied to access the system stability . in this case",
    ", all known dynamic components can be grouped in set @xmath116 and unknown dynamic ones can be classified in set @xmath117 .",
    "in this section we discuss the possible applications of the mathematical techniques explained above .",
    "dsa are used to analyze the security of power systems and assess various types of stabilities such as voltage stability in voltage stability assessment ( vsa ) and transient stability which is assessed in transient stability assessment ( tsa ) .",
    "the configuration of the dsa integrated into the energy management system ( ems ) is discussed in details in @xcite .",
    "depending on the purpose of the assessment and the time - scale of the function of interest , the input of dsa may be different .",
    "typical dsa assess the stability of a given operating state determined either from supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) or phasor measurement unit ( pmu ) measurement tools or constructed in framework of scenario analysis for planning or operation purposes .",
    "being a fundamental component of dsa toolbox , the main goal of vsa is to certify pre- and post - contingency voltage stability and calculate the voltage stability margin .",
    "the contingency set typically includes major equipment outages such as generator , transformer , line tripping .",
    "@xmath118 security set is normally of interest @xcite .",
    "brute - force accounting for load dynamics and other uncertainties in traditional vsa is computationally expensive due to large number of scenarios that need to be analyzed .",
    "an alternative proposed here and discussed in more details in section [ sec : rsa ] is based on the worst case scenario analysis and relies only on the analysis of static characteristics of the loads and well - understood dynamic characteristics of the generators .",
    "hence it eliminates the need for computationally expensive dynamic simulations and stochastic monte carlo approached to modeling the uncertainty .    typically , the objective of the dsa module is to assess the system stability margins and its behavior in major contingencies . at the input ,",
    "the dsa module admits a scenario which includes : i ) a power flow base case which describes a snapshot of the system conditions ; ii ) dynamic data of the system ; iii ) set of critical disturbances . the output from the dsa module is composed of the system stability and corresponding margins .",
    "the work @xcite describes dsa in more details from the perspectives of both traditional approaches in off - line analysis as well as intelligent system ( is ) based one for on - line assessments .",
    "it is worth to distinguish the two main classes of security assessment , i.e. static security assessment ( ssa ) and dsa .",
    "ssa concerns whether the operating constraints are satisfied , i.e. whether the post - contingency voltage lies within the acceptable range , whereas dsa looks for the system stability . in some cases , acceptable voltage levels may imply that the system is stable .",
    "however , in general , this relationship is not such simple .",
    "therefore , the system stability needs to be assessed thoroughly in the framework of dsa .",
    "the algorithms developed in this work can form the foundation of a potentially more powerful technique that we call robust stability assessment ( rsa ) .",
    "specifically we propose to use rsa to develop the fast screening phase of vsa in an online dsa that is required to be fast enough to either automatically or manually choose the proper remedial control actions .",
    "for an effective and powerful vsa , the accuracy and the speed of computation are the two most crucial and challenging issues .",
    "as previous mentioned , the accuracy of vsa is affected due to uncertainties .",
    "rsa is able to eliminate such errors .",
    "moreover , the fast algorithm of rsa is extremely helpful to speed up the program , especially when it relies on deterministic method that exhaustively screens contingency and searches for secure limits . even for intelligent system",
    "based vsa , rsa is still able to help to remove a significant number of possibilities .",
    "the efficiently computational aspect of the proposed algorithm can be easily scale to bulk systems which is impossible for traditional dynamic approaches while rendering the meaning of dynamic stability assessment .    within this approach in rsa ,",
    "the stability is certified not for a single mathematical model of a system , but rather for the whole set of systems defined by different realizations of uncertain elements .",
    "the key steps required for performing the robust stability assessment are explained below :    1 .",
    "* input * the input of rsa is an equilibrium configuration of the system characterized by the levels of load consumption , network model , and dynamic model of the generators . 2 .",
    "* initialization * on the initialization stage the algorithm defines the model of the system by introducing the uncertain model of the load . in the simplest approach",
    "the load buses are modeled as time dependent impedances as discussed in section [ sec : loadmodeling ] . in the framework of more advanced approaches it may be reasonable to separate the actual loads into static components , well - defined dynamic ones ( like aluminum smelters ) and finally the uncertain dynamic loads .",
    "only the uncertain components should be incorporated in the @xmath68 part of the dynamical system descriptions , whereas all the other components should be modeled as known ones and described by the vector @xmath67 .",
    "* linearization * the dynamic model of the system is linearized and the matrix @xmath119 is calculated for some arbitrarily chosen load relaxation time constants matrix @xmath70 . as explained in previous section the choice of initial @xmath70 does not have any effect on the outcome of the analysis .",
    "optimization * the semi - definite programming problem is solved for the constructed matrix @xmath119 . whenever the resulting value @xmath115 is positive the equilibrium point",
    "is certified to be robust stable , i.e. it is provably stable for any matrix @xmath70 .",
    "* direct analysis * as the condition @xmath120 from is only sufficient but not necessary , whenever the result of optimization results in negative @xmath115 , nothing can be said about the stability of the system .",
    "the user of rsa has to rely on other probabilistic or deterministic techniques to assess the probability of having stable system given the uncertainty in load dynamics .",
    "rsa can be naturally incorporated in several planning and operational studies that are described below .",
    "one specific application of the rsa approach is the deterministic stability assessment that is regularly performed during power system operation . at any moment of time ,",
    "the system operators need to know the following @xcite .    1 .   whether the current state is secure 2 .   whether the system will remain secure after the next several minute changes 3",
    "if the system is insecure , what countermeasures need to be carried out    the general deterministic stability assessment answers these questions via the following sequence of steps @xcite :    1 .",
    "develop the power flow base cases for the study 2 .",
    "select the contingency set 3 .",
    "select parameters in the expected operating range [ paramstep ] 4 .   identify security constraint violations 5 .",
    "find the security boundary 6 .",
    "construct the comprehensive reports like plots or tables by combining all the security boundaries    robust stability technique naturally fits in this process without any adjustments to the logic .",
    "the key advantage of the rsa is its ability to certify the stability and security of the system even in the presence of dynamic uncertainty naturally expressed as parameter ranges in step [ paramstep ] ) above .",
    "the proposed robust stability criterion is compatible with both off - line and on - line security assessments in the presence of uncertainties .",
    "moreover , it may also provide additional benefits for implementing real - time and distributed security assessment schemes which are still the main challenge to the current technologies @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the assessment has to be performed without access to full model of external entities , and the operator may represent the dynamic response of these entities via equivalent models with uncertain time - constants .",
    "such a scheme is more robust to communication system malfunctions and potentially reduces the requirements to throughput and latency of sensing , communication and computation components . in some cases ,",
    "large enough robust stability region can be directly applied in operation procedures and used as secure regimes that are displayed to the operators . moreover , as mentioned before , rsa can access the system dynamic stability simply based on static analysis ( power flow ) and well - understood dynamic components , the dynamical secure regimes can be constructed in advance .",
    "specific demonstration of the usage of robust stability in vsa is presented in section [ sec : wscc ] where we examine the @xmath118 contingency set of wscc @xmath2-machine , @xmath3-bus system .",
    "the optimization problem can be used not only to certify the stability of a given point but also to estimate the stability margin .",
    "indeed , the value of @xmath115 is naturally interpreted as the worst case rate of decay of the lyapunov function defined by @xmath121 and can be thus viewed as the worst case stability margin . the security indicator defined by @xmath115 can be used for risk monitoring purposes and can assist the system operators in designing the preventive control strategies . in the latter it is natural to optimize for control actions that ensure some minimal level of worst - case stability margin .    with additional research effort invested",
    "it should be possible to modify the security indicator defined by @xmath115 from in a way that it s value reflects the probabilities of system losing stability in the presence of random factors , such as renewable generators . to achieve this goal it is necessary to study the sensitivity of matrix @xmath84 with respect to random factors , and modify the term @xmath122 in a way that certificate that bounds @xmath115 from below can be interpreted in probabilistic way",
    ", i.e. probability of system losing stability bounded from above .",
    "rsa and security indicator discussed in section [ sec : si ] can be also used for planning and dispatch purposes in the framework of stability or security constrained optimization . in this case",
    "the security indicator can be used as one of the optimization objectives or constraints . as closed form expression for",
    "@xmath115 does not exist , the corresponding optimization needs to rely on some iterative heuristics , like genetic algorithms .",
    "the algorithms may need to be complemented with direct approaches as described for example in @xcite .",
    "in this section we report the results of application of the robust stability certification to several common models of power systems .",
    "moreover , rsa technique does not explicitly address the question of feasibility of the operating point , although it could be trivially extended with any kinds of voltage and current constraints .",
    "as these constraints depend on the operating point , and not on the dynamic equations , they can be checked separately from the small signal stability . whenever the small - signal stability of the operating point needs to be analyzed , and rsa technique allows to assess stability even in the presence of load modeling uncertainty . as a matter of fact , in contingency analysis ,",
    "it is essential to assess the system stability even when the voltage levels are unacceptable according to normal operating conditions .",
    "the rudimentary 2-bus system shown in figure [ fig : rudi ] is adopted from @xcite and is extended with the dynamic model of the loads .",
