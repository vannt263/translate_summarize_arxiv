    "if tev - scale supersymmetry is discovered at lhc , it will open a window in which to explore physics at higher - energy scales . in particular",
    ", the measurement of superpartner masses can provide a test of different proposed mechanisms for breaking supersymmetry .",
    "moreover , it may allow us to probe the underlying theory which provides the uv completion of known low - energy physics .",
    "in particular , in various string theory compactifications where the effective low - energy @xmath2 supergravity approximation holds true , it is possible to generate superpartner spectra which may be compared to whatever may be observed at lhc .",
    "the most studied model of supersymmetry breaking is minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , which arises from adopting the simplest ansatz for the k\"ahler metric , treating all chiral superfields symmetrically . in this framework ,",
    "@xmath2 supergravity is broken in a hidden sector which is communicated to the observable sector through gravitational interactions .",
    "such models are characterized by the following parameters : a universal scalar mass @xmath3 , a universal gaugino mass @xmath4 , the higgsino mixing @xmath5-parameter , the higgs bilinear @xmath6-parameter , a universal trilinear coupling @xmath7 , and tan  @xmath0 .",
    "one then determines the @xmath6 and @xmath8 parameters by the minimization of the higgs potential triggering rewsb , with the sign of @xmath5 remaining undetermined .",
    "thus , we are left with only four parameters .",
    "although , msugra is one of the most generic frameworks that can be adopted , many string compactifications typically yield expressions for the soft terms which are even more constrained , in particular , when supersymmetry breaking is dominated by the k``ahler moduli and/or dilaton . as is well - known ,",
    "the k''ahler moduli of type i , iib orientifold , and heterotic string compactifications have a classical no - scale structure  @xcite , which guarantees that the vacuum energy vanishes at tree - level .",
    "the no - scale structure corresponds to having non - vanishing expectation values for the auxiliary fields of the k\"ahler moduli .",
    "the generic appearance of the no - scale structure across many string compactifications combined with the highly - constrained and thus predictive framework strongly motivates the consideration of modulus - dominated supersymmetry breaking , although there are some string models for which the soft - terms are not as constrained ( see  @xcite for a model of this kind ) .    for modulus - dominated supersymmetry breaking ,",
    "we generically have @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this reduces the number of free parameters compared to msugra down to two , @xmath4 and tan@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , adopting a strict no - scale framework , one can also fix the @xmath6-parameter as @xmath11 , and thus we are led to a _",
    "one - parameter _ model where all of the soft terms may be fixed in terms of @xmath4 . however , for this framework to be consistent , the value of tan@xmath0 at the electroweak scale should be consistent with @xmath6 at the string scale .    in a previous paper",
    ", we studied a generic one - parameter model and found its viable parameter space  @xcite .",
    "however , in this work we did not require that tan@xmath0 obtained at the electroweak scale be consistent with the value of @xmath11 defined at the gut scale . for the present work , we impose this constraint for a generic one - parameter model and find that there is no viable supersymmetry parameter space , assuming the standard rge running between the electroweak scale and the gut scale .",
    "furthermore , we find the same result for m - theory and type iib flux compactifications .",
    "in addition , we consider different modular weights for some of the chiral fields , again with negative results .",
    "we conclude that modulus - dominated supersymmetry breaking is not viable , in the case of a standard rge running of the soft terms starting from the gut scale .",
    "for certain classes of string compactifications , the soft - terms are of the form @xmath9 and @xmath10 if supersymmetry is dominated by the k\"ahler moduli and/or the universal dilaton .",
    "in particular , much work has been done in the past to study two generic cases inspired by no - scale supergravity in the framework of the free - fermionic class of heterotic string compactifications .",
    "the first of these two cases is referred to as the special _ dilaton _ scenario , @xmath12 while the second is referred to as the strict _ moduli _ scenario , @xmath13 in previous work , it was found that there is no viable parameter space for the strict moduli scenario which satisfies experimental constraints .",
    "however , in the case of the special dilaton scenario there is a small allowed parameter space .",
    "moreover , the soft - terms for many string compactifications will also be of similar form .",
    "in particular , the soft terms for heterotic m - theory compactifications take the form  @xcite @xmath14 while for dilaton dominated supersymmetry breaking they take the form @xmath15 these expressions reduce to the above moduli and dilaton scenarios respectively in the limit @xmath16 , where @xmath17    in addition , the so - called large - volume models have been studied extensively  @xcite  @xcite in recent years and the generic soft terms for this framework have been calculated in  @xcite .",
    "these models involve type iib compactifications where the moduli are stabilized by fluxes and quantum corrections to the k\"ahler potential generate an exponentially large volume .",
    "this exponentially large volume may lower the string scale to an intermediate level which can be in the range @xmath18 gev .",
    "in such models , the soft terms can take the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a universal gaugino mass .",
    "as can be seen for these different string compactifications , the soft terms can generically be of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are constants .",
    "in addition , we will take the string scale to be @xmath25  gev .",
    "however , we should note that the string scale at which the soft - terms are defined could be different from the conventional gut scale .",
    "in particular , we can see for the case of the m - theory compactifications , the unification scale can be higher than the gut scale , while for the large - volume type iib flux compactifications , the string scale could be substantially lower .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the value of the @xmath5 parameter and tan@xmath0 are determined at the electroweak scale by imposing the conditions @xmath26 and @xmath27 which follow from the minimization of the higgs potential triggering rewsb . from these equations",
    ", one can calculate the value of the b - parameter at the electroweak scale . in order for this to be",
    "a true one - parameter model , @xmath6 at the electroweak scale should be consistent with the ansatz @xmath11 at the gut scale .    the usual procedure to find the viable parameter space is to calculate the sparticle masses using the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath4 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and tan@xmath0 , and plot @xmath31 for a specific tan@xmath0 , and further scan the entire tan@xmath0 space for solutions that satisfy the current experimental constraints and corresponding relic neutralino density .",
    "in particular , such an analysis was performed for a generic one - parameter model in  @xcite .",
    "however , the consistency constraint between the b - parameter at the electroweak scale and the gut scale has not been imposed in this analysis . for the present work ,",
    "we perform a scan of the parameter space , including tan@xmath0 , and filter the results through the latest experimental constraints and dark matter density , and in addition , compare the allowed parameter space with the value of the b - parameter at @xmath32 . for the present work",
    ", we will identify @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "this determines whether the allowed parameter space calculated from tan@xmath0 can also satisfy the constraint on the b - parameter at the unification scale ( see  @xcite for a similar study in the case of f - theory compactifications ) .",
    "first , we generate sets of soft supersymmetry breaking terms at the unification scale for the models we consider , then the soft terms are input into micromegas 2.0.7  @xcite using suspect 2.34  @xcite as a front end to evolve the soft terms down to the electroweak scale via the renormalization group equations ( rges ) and then to calculate the corresponding relic neutralino density .",
    "we take the top quark mass to be @xmath34  gev  @xcite and leave tan  @xmath0 as a free parameter , while @xmath5 is determined by the requirement of rewsb .",
    "however , we do take @xmath35 as suggested by the results of @xmath36 for the muon .",
    "the resulting superpartner spectra are filtered according to the following criteria :    1 .   the 5-year wmap data combined with measurements of type ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations in the galaxy distribution for the cold dark matter density  @xcite , 0.1109 @xmath37 0.1177 , where a neutralino lsp is the dominant component of the relic density .",
    "in addition , we look at the ssc model  @xcite , in which a dilution factor of @xmath38(10 ) is allowed  @xcite , where @xmath39 1.1 . for a discussion of the ssc model within the context of msugra , see  @xcite .",
    "we also investigate another case where a neutralino lsp makes up a subdominant component , allowing for the possibility that dark matter could be composed of matter such as axions , cryptons , or other particles .",
    "we employ this possibility by removing the lower bound .",
    "2 .   the experimental limits on the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process , @xmath40 .",
    "the results from the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag )  @xcite , in addition to the babar , belle , and cleo results , are : @xmath41 .",
    "there is also a more recent estimate  @xcite of @xmath42 . for our analysis",
    ", we use the limits @xmath43 , where experimental and theoretical errors are added in quadrature .",
    "3 .   the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath44 . for this analysis",
    "we use the 2@xmath45 level boundaries , @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath47 where the decay has a @xmath48 dependence .",
    "we take the upper bound to be @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "5 .   the lep limit on the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass , @xmath50 gev  @xcite .    to determine the b - parameter at @xmath51",
    ", b is determined at @xmath52 from eqns .",
    "( [ higgsmin1 ] ) and ( [ higgsmin2 ] ) .",
    "then it is run up to the unification scale to compute the boundary condition for b. a sufficient number of iterations between @xmath52 and @xmath53 are calculated until stable results are achieved .",
    "the value for b at the gut scale we use is at the last iteration before the results become stable . to accomplish this , we modify the suspect code to output the b - parameter value from the rge loop during this final iteration .",
    "we capture the b - parameter through this method for all sets of the soft - supersymmetry breaking terms that we calculated the experimentally allowed parameter space .",
    "once b is computed for all points , we compare this value of b to the theoretical prediction for b at the unification scale for each model we consider in a plot of the ratio of b to the gaugino mass versus tan@xmath0 .",
    "the only points that satisfy the b constraint are those points on the b - parameter curves that intersect with the horizontal lines representing the theoretical prediction .",
    "additionally , it is also necessary for these points of intersection between the b curves and predictions to lie within the range of points within the experimentally allowed parameter space .",
    "these points just described will satisfy not just the aforementioned five experimental constraints , but also the constraint on the b - parameter at the unification scale .",
    "however , as we will show here , it is very difficult to satisfy all these constraints simultaneously for a model with universal soft - supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "we compute the b - parameter at the gut scale here for two models : a generic one - parameter model  @xcite and an m - theory model  @xcite .",
    "we find that for the models with a predicted b - parameter at the gut scale , namely the minimal one - parameter model and the m - theory model without corrections , i.e. @xmath54 , contrary to the solutions discovered when only considering the experimental constraints , there are no solutions when the b - parameter constraint is taken into account . in light of this , we shall vary the moduli for the one - parameter model to investigate whether some solutions can be found that satisfy the b - parameter constraint , in addition to only satisfying the experimental constraints .",
    "it is also necessary to determine whether solutions exist for the m - theory model when @xmath55 that can satisfy the b - parameter constraint .",
    "for the one - parameter model , we begin with the minimal model in the special dilaton scenario with the soft terms of the form    @xmath56    and construct a method of varying the modular weights . to accomplish this ,",
    "we modify the expressions above and introduce three new parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 that will allow us to investigate more general cases :    @xmath59     vs. tan@xmath0 at the gut scale for the one - parameter model . each plot contains four sets of ten curves , each set with a different @xmath60 .",
    "the ten curves are for @xmath4 = 100 , 200 , ... , 900 , 1000 gev , where the lowermost curve in each set is @xmath4 = 100 gev and the uppermost curve in each set is @xmath4 = 1000 gev .",

    "the 16 cases shall be divided up into four data sets such that each data set will be plotted independently .",
    "each data set will have constant @xmath65 , and thus constant @xmath28 , while @xmath66 is varied , and hence @xmath67 is varied .",

    "our motivation for attempting this is that since the higgs typically come from a different sector , the dependence on the kahler moduli should be different . while keeping @xmath62 , the modular weight on the higgs scalar was varied , nonetheless , there was no shifting of the b - parameter curves and only a slight change in the number of points allowed by the experimental constraints .",

    "a well - motivated framework for studying supersymmetry breaking is to assume that it is dominated by the k\"ahler moduli and/or the universal dilaton .",
