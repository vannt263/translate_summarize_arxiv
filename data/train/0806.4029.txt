    "the @xmath0 , an excited state of the @xmath6 with negative parity , has been studied for decades ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the review until 1998 ) .",
    "its production has been mainly conducted in proton - proton scattering and meson - proton scattering .",
    "recently , however , the leps collaboration has carried out the measurement of the @xmath4 produced in the @xmath7 reaction  @xcite . while for the ground state @xmath6 and the @xmath8-wave @xmath9 photoproductions",
    ", there are many available experimental data  @xcite as well as theoretical investigations  @xcite , there has been a few theoretical works on the @xmath4 photoproduction to date  @xcite and related experiments mainly performed by the leps collaboration at spring-8  @xcite .    among the theoretical works , ref .",
    "@xcite estimated the differential cross section for the @xmath10 reaction , considering the crossing symmetry and duality , whereas refs .",
    "@xcite concentrated on the @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum via the @xmath11 scattering process using the @xmath5-wave chiral dynamics , also known as the chiral unitary model ( @xmath12um ) , in which the @xmath4 is assumed to be the molecular - type @xmath13 state rather than a three - quark color - singlet ( @xmath14 ) one such as usual baryons . in the recent leps experiment  @xcite , interestingly , it turned out that the @xmath15 production ratio is very different between the low ( @xmath16 gev ) and high ( @xmath17 gev ) energy regions .",
    "it implies that the total cross section for the @xmath4 increases near the threshold , and then starts to decrease as the photon energy is increased .",
    "it was suggested that this interesting tendency may be caused by either the different production mechanisms from that for the @xmath18 or the novel internal structure of the @xmath4 .    in the present work , as mentioned previously , we study the @xmath19 reaction , using the effective lagrangian in the born approximation .",
    "we make use of theoretical and experimental information to determine relevant parameters such as the coupling strengths and cutoff masses for the phenomenological form factors , which are treated in a gauge - invariant manner . by changing the cutoff mass for the phenomenological form factor for the @xmath20 vertex , the size effect , which may encode the internal structure of the @xmath4 ,",
    "is investigated .",
    "we observe that , depending on the choice of the @xmath1 coupling strength , the total cross section becomes @xmath2 near the threshold and starts to decrease slowly beyond @xmath21 gev , and the angular dependence shows a mild enhancement in the forward direction .",
    "it is also found that the size effect of the @xmath4 is seen mainly due to the @xmath22-channel near the threshold but very small . comparing these results to the experimental data  @xcite",
    ", the overall energy dependence of the @xmath23 is very similar .",
    "this indicates that the production mechanism of the @xmath4 is dominated by the @xmath5-channel contribution rather than the @xmath24-channel one .",
    "the photon - beam asymmetry shows a strong electric photon - hadron coupling contribution due to the @xmath24-channel .",
    "we organize the present work as follows : in section ii , we briefly explain the general formalism relevant for studying the @xmath25 scattering process . in section iii ,",
    "the numerical results are given with discussions .",
    "theoretical ambiguities are briefly explained in section iv .",
    "the final section is devoted to summarize the present work and to draw conclusions .",
    "photoproduction from the proton target , @xmath26 , in the psuedoscalar ( ps ) meson - baryon coupling scheme.,width=453 ]    we begin this section with providing the general formalism to investigate the @xmath0 photorpdocution . in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , we depict the relevant feynman diagrams . the four momenta for the involved particles",

    ", we neglect the tensor coupling of the @xmath36 vertex , assuming its strength to be small .    above the threshold @xmath37 mev , there are eight nucleon resonances ( @xmath38 ) , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , up to @xmath39 mev : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . except for the @xmath48 ,",
    "their confirmations are still poor ( below two stars ) .",
    "moreover , we have little knowledge about the @xmath49 decay process in comparison to other hyperons .",
    "hence , we exclude these resonance contributions not to increase theoretical ambiguities for the moment , considering the present situation .",
    "we now would like to discuss how to determine the coupling strength of the @xmath50 briefly .",
    "although the @xmath4 does not decay into @xmath13 in free space , the value of the @xmath50 was estimated within the potential model and chiral unitary model ( @xmath12um )  @xcite . in the @xmath12um , it was argued that the @xmath4 may consist of two individual poles  @xcite .",
    "the pole positions are @xmath51 mev ( lower one ) and @xmath52 ( higher one ) in the dimensional regularization scheme  @xcite .",
    "the coupling strengths to these poles were obtained from the residue of the amplitude , resulting in @xmath53 for the lower pole and @xmath54 for the higher one in the dimensional regularization computed in the @xmath12um , since it is a complex number in general at the pole . ] .",
    "when the dipole- and monopole - type form factors are applied to the regularization of the loop integral , one has @xmath55 and @xmath56 , whereas @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively  @xcite . considering that the higher pole couples strongly to the @xmath13 state , we take the average of those values of @xmath50 , resulting in @xmath59 .",
    "this value is not much different from @xmath60 , given in ref .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath61 for the @xmath4 amounts to @xmath62 in the su(3 ) quark model  @xcite . from the @xmath12um ,",
    "it was also estimated to be @xmath63  @xcite . therefore , without loss of generality , we use @xmath64 for numerical calculations .",
    "the value of @xmath65 is chosen to be a free parameter , assuming that @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 can be computed from experiments and reads @xmath68 for the neutral decay and @xmath69 for the charged decay  @xcite .",
    "having performed straightforward calculation by using the effective lagrangian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : el1405 ] ) , we obtain the invariant amplitudes for each diagram within the ps - coupling scheme as follows : @xmath70\\rlap{/}{\\epsilon}u(p_1)\\times f_{\\gamma nn}f_{kn\\lambda^ * } , \\nonumber\\\\ i\\mathcal{m}_u&=&\\frac{e_q\\kappa_{\\lambda^*}g_{kn\\lambda^ * } } { 2m_{\\lambda^ * } } \\bar{u}(p_2)\\rlap{/}{\\epsilon}\\rlap{/}{k}_1 \\frac{(\\rlap{/}{p}_2-\\rlap{/}{k}_1+m_{\\lambda^ * } ) } { u - m^2_{\\lambda^*}}u(p_1 ) \\times f_{kn\\lambda^*}f_{\\gamma\\lambda^*\\lambda^ * } , \\nonumber\\\\ i\\mathcal{m}^k_t&=&2e_kg_{kn\\lambda^*}\\bar{u}(p_2 ) \\frac{(k_2\\cdot\\epsilon)}{t - m^2_k}u(p_1 ) \\times f_{kn\\lambda^*}f_{\\gamma kk } , \\nonumber\\\\ i\\mathcal{m}^{k^*}_t&=&ig_{\\gamma kk^*}g_{k^*n\\lambda^ * } \\bar{u}(p_2)\\gamma_5\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\sigma\\rho } k^\\mu_1\\epsilon^\\nu k^\\sigma_2\\gamma^\\rho } { t - m^2_{k^*}}u(p_1 ) \\times f_{k^*n\\lambda^*}f_{\\gamma kk^*},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the mandelstam variables are @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , while @xmath74 the polarization vector for the incident photon .",
    "the form factors for the electromagnetic ( em ) and hadronic vertices are given as : @xmath75 where the subscripts @xmath76 and @xmath77 stand for the mesonic and baryonic particles involved , while @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the on - shell mass and the three momentum for the relevant particles .",
    "the @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the cutoff masses for the em and hadronic form factors , respectively . in principle",
    ", the cutoff mass corresponds to the inverse size of a hadron approximately . in order to preserve the gauge invariance , since the @xmath22- and @xmath31-exchange channels are gauge invariant by themselves",
    ", it is enough to take @xmath82 , assuming similar sizes for the proton ( @xmath83 fm ) and kaon ( @xmath84 fm ) , approximately .",
    "moreover , we also set @xmath85 and @xmath86 for simplicity .    assuming that the @xmath4 can be regarded as a molecular - type @xmath13 bound state rather than a @xmath14 color - singlet state",
    ", one can infer that its size may be large in comparison to usual baryons such as the nucleon .",
    "in fact , we know from the phenomenological and chiral potential model calculations that the absolute value of the em charge radius of @xmath4 , @xmath87 was estimated as @xmath88  @xcite and @xmath89  @xcite , respectively , and its value was estimated to be @xmath90  @xcite in the @xmath12um .",
    "these values are about two times larger than those of the typical baryons such as the proton @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , one may expect that the cutoff mass for the form factor for the @xmath20 can be smaller than usual baryons , corresponding to its larger spatial size .",
    "thus , we choose the cutoff mass for the em form factor to be @xmath92 mev for the all vertices as done for the @xmath93 photoproduction  @xcite , except for the @xmath20 vertex in the @xmath22-channel , for which we employ @xmath94 mev , based on previous studies in various models .",
    "although the cutoff mass for the hadronic form factors remain undetermined , we take it as the same as that for the em ones for brevity , @xmath95 mev .",
    "we note that choosing a different cutoff mass only for the @xmath96 in the @xmath22-channel does not make any harm to the gauge invariance , since the @xmath22-channel amplitude is gauge invariant by itself , as it contains only the magnetic coupling .",
    "all relevant parameters used in the present work are listed in table  [ table0 ] .",
    ".relevant coupling strengths and anomalous magnetic moment , and cutoff masses for the @xmath4 photoproduction .",
    "the @xmath97 mev is only for the electromagnetic form factor @xmath98 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we may expect possible contributions from the nucleon , @xmath99 and hyperon resonances , which have been excluded in the present work .",
    "for instance , oh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath18 photoproduction in a similar method to ours , but with various resonance contributions , whose relevant coupling strengths to the @xmath18 were derived theoretically , the su(3 ) relation being considered . from their analysis , it turned out that the resonance contribution plays an important role for the region from the threshold to @xmath100 gev .",
    "if this is the case also for the @xmath4 photoproduction , although they are different in the spin and parity , and information on the @xmath4 related to the resonances is very poor in comparison to the @xmath18 , the present results can be altered in a large extent .",
    "in the present work , we have investigated the @xmath0 photoproduction employing the effective lagrangian approach in the born approximation .",
    "we took into account the minimal contributions , the @xmath5- and @xmath22-channels , and the pseudoscalar @xmath28- and vector @xmath31-exchange contributions in the @xmath24-channel , without nucleon- and hyperon - resonance contributions such that the analysis of the @xmath101 photoproduction mechanism can be easily achieved .",
    "all the necessary parameters were determined from the possible theoretical ( the @xmath12 unitary model ) and experimental ( the @xmath93 photoproduction ) results .",
    "the phenomenological electromagnetic and hadronic form factors were introduced with the gauge invariance preserved .    assuming the molecular - type @xmath13 bound state for the @xmath4 rather than the @xmath14 color - singlet one , we examined the size effect of the @xmath4 by changing the cutoff mass for the electromagnetic form factor sitting on the @xmath20 interacting vertex . choosing this cutoff mass @xmath94 mev , which may correspond to a larger spatial size of the @xmath4 and is about a half of the other cutoff mass @xmath95 mev , we observed that , depending on the choice of the @xmath1 coupling strength , the total cross section turns out to be @xmath102 near the threshold and decreases slowly beyond @xmath21 gev , showing the @xmath5-channel dominance .",
    "the angular dependence shows a mild enhancement in the forward direction due to the @xmath28-exchange in the @xmath24-channel . by the same reason",
    ", the photon - beam asymmetry resulted in the electric - coupling dominance ( negative photon - beam asymmetry ) for all angle regions .    concerning the size effect of the @xmath4 , had we considered its larger size , the bump at @xmath21 gev shown in the total cross section would have increased slightly and smoothly , because of the enhancement of the @xmath22-channel contribution near the threshold .",
    "however , we note that the size effect is hard to be seen in all the physical observables computed in the present work .",
    "consequently , we note that the enhancement of the total cross section near the threshold , as reported by the leps experiment , can depend much on the different production mechanisms , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , not on the novel internal structure of the @xmath4 .    finally , we discussed the theoretical ambiguities which can make effects on the present results given in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] . among them , while the coupling strengths made little change the physical observables , it turned out that the form factor schemes are of great significance in the present results .",
    "the contributions from higher resonances may play also an important role in describing the mechanism of the @xmath4 photoproduction .",
    "the corresponding works are under progress .",
