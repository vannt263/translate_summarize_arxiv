    "quark and gluon contributions to the nucleon spin are described by polarized parton distribution functions ( polarized pdfs ) and their first moments .",
    "it became clear that only a small fraction of nucleon spin is carried by quarks and antiquarks .",
    "therefore , a large gluon polarization or effects of orbital angular momenta should be possible sources for explaining the origin of the nucleon spin .",
    "the gluon polarization is expected to be clarified in the near future , whereas it would take time to determine the effects of the orbital angular momenta .",
    "polarized pdfs have been investigated by global analyses of data on polarized lepton - nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "polarized quark distributions are determined relatively well ; however , the polarized gluon distribution @xmath3 is not accurately determined .",
    "here , @xmath4 is the bjorken scaling variable , and @xmath7 is the difference between the gluon distribution with helicity parallel to that of parent nucleon and the one with helicity anti - parallel .",
    "the gluon distribution contributes to the structure function @xmath1 as a higher - order effect in the expansion by the running coupling constant @xmath8 of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the unpolarized gluon distribution has been determined primarily by the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath10 at small @xmath4 , where @xmath9 is defined by the momentum transfer @xmath11 by @xmath12 in lepton scattering .",
    "the kinematical range of @xmath4 and @xmath9 is still limited for @xmath1 in determining @xmath3 by the scaling violation , so that the determination of @xmath3 is difficult from the scaling violation . nonetheless , it is noteworthy that there are @xmath9 differences between the compasss and hermes data for @xmath1 in the range of @xmath13 . such @xmath9 differences could be used for constraining a gluon polarization at large @xmath4 as pointed out in ref .",
    "however , this idea should be tested by future measurements on the scaling violation in @xmath1 because the @xmath9 differences could originate also from higher - twist effects @xcite .",
    "other types of measurements are needed to improve the situation of @xmath3 .",
    "there were measurements on @xmath3 in lepton - nucleon scattering by observing high-@xmath14 hadrons @xcite and open - charm events @xcite .",
    "these data provided constraints on the gluon polarization at @xmath2 .",
    "they indicated that the ratio @xmath15 is small although experimental errors are still large .",
    "measurements at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) are also important for constraining the gluon polarization . for example , @xmath0 and jet - production data @xcite in polarized proton - proton collisions are valuable for the determination of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , we showed that the @xmath0 data play an important role in reducing the uncertainty of @xmath3 by a global analysis including the @xmath0 data in addition to the dis data @xcite .",
    "certain fragmentation functions are used in the analysis of @xmath0-production processes .",
    "we should be careful that gluon and light - quark fragmentation functions have large uncertainties at small @xmath9 or small @xmath14 @xcite .    in order to determine the polarized pdfs including the gluon polarization , precise measurements are needed also in dis . after our previous analysis @xcite ,",
    "new dis data are reported by the clas @xcite , hermes @xcite , and compass @xcite collaborations . in future",
    ", the structure function @xmath1 for the deuteron will be accurately measured at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) by the proposed experiment e07 - 011 @xcite .",
    "the measurements at jlab should be valuable for reducing large uncertainties of the polarized antiquark and gluon distributions because they cover a large-@xmath4 region at small @xmath9 .    in this work ,",
    "we determine the polarized pdfs by global analyses of the data for spin asymmetries @xmath16 in polarized lepton - nucleon dis and double spin asymmetries @xmath17 of the @xmath0 production in proton - proton collisions .",
    "in particular , we focus our discussions on determination of the polarized gluon distribution function . the purposes of this article are the following .    * the rhic @xmath0-production data could indicate a node - type distribution for @xmath3 , so that two types of distributions are studied in the global analysis by taking a positive distribution for @xmath3 and a node - type distribution which changes sign at @xmath2 .",
    "* among various future experimental projects , we investigate impact on the polarized pdfs , especially on the polarized gluon distribution function , from precise measurements on the structure function @xmath1 of the deuteron by the jlab - e07 - 011 experiment @xcite .",
    "the e07 - 011 data will be so precise that @xmath3 could be constrained . * the polarized pdfs obtained with the e07 - 011 data are compared with the ones including the @xmath0-production data especially in reducing uncertainties of @xmath3 and its first moment .",
    "we provide a new aac08 ( asymmetry analysis collaboration in 2008 ) library by the current global analyses because updated aac distributions have not been provided since the 2003 version @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] , three data sets are introduced for investigating roles of the rhic @xmath0 and jlab data , and our analysis method is explained .",
    "analysis results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ results ] , and they are summarized in sec . [ summary ] .",
    ".used data sets in our global analyses .",
    "the  dis \" indicates current dis data on @xmath1 .",
    "the rhic @xmath0 data are taken from ref .",
    "the jlab - e07 - 011 data are calculated by using estimated errors in refs . @xcite and set - a results , and actual vales are shown in table [ tabl : jlab - e07 - 011 ] .",
    "the notation @xmath18 indicates an included data set . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     analysis results of c@xmath19 indicate that the polarized pdfs and their uncertainties are almost the same as the positive - type distributions of the analysis c in the valence - quark and antiquark parts .",
    "determined pdfs of c@xmath20 are also almost the same as the node - type ones of the set c. however , the gluon distributions and their uncertainties are slightly modified although @xmath4-dependent functional forms are not changed .",
    "the gluon first moments and their uncertainties are shown in table [ t:1st - moment-01-c ] .",
    "as expected , the uncertainties become larger than the ones for the analysis c in table [ t:1st - moment-01 ] : @xmath21 [ 0.73 in set c ; 0.71 ( b ) ; 1.36 ( a ) ] for the positive type ; 0.70 [ 0.54 in set c ; 0.77 ( b ) ; 1.02 ( a ) ] for the node type . according to the c@xmath19 and c@xmath20 results ,",
    "the improvement from the set a is not as large as the one in the set c. however , it is still comparable with the rhic improvement in b.    it is important to find that the large uncertainty of @xmath22 is significantly reduced by the proposed e07 - 011 experiment according to the analysis c ( and c@xmath19 , c@xmath20 ) .",
    "the improvement of @xmath22 is especially clear in the integral over the region @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the proposed jlab experiment is valuable for the determination of @xmath22 in addition to the quark and antiquark moments .",
    "if the polarized lepton scattering data are accurate enough , they can contribute to a better determination of the gluon spin content .",
    "it is interesting to find that the analysis - c uncertainties are almost the same as the ones in the analysis b. however , it should be noted that the uncertainties of the pion fragmentation functions and scale uncertainties are not taken into account in the error estimate of the analysis b.    from these comparisons , we found that the jlab measurements of the the proposed e07 - 011 can contribute to reducing the uncertainty of the gluon spin content by about 47% in the analysis c ( 30% in c@xmath19 and c@xmath20 ) .",
    "the rhic @xmath0 measurements also reduce the uncertainty , but the inclusive lepton scattering data are valuable in the sense that they are free from the ambiguities of the fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "we should , however , mention that future rhic experiments will also improve the determination of @xmath3 by measurements of pion , jet , and direct - photon production processes . to be fair with the rhic - spin and other high - energy spin projects , it is desirable that a global analysis should be made together with other expected data by the time of the future jlab - e07 - 011 data .",
    "furthermore , the current estimation would indicate a slightly better determination of @xmath3 from the jlab data because some fluctuations are expected in actual measurements from the cental spin asymmetries .",
    "however , we believe that our analyses with the expected errors are good enough in comparing the obtained relative errors for the gluon spin content from the dis and collider data . in this article , we simply showed the role of accurate dis data , by taking the jlab - e07 - 011 data as an example , in comparison with the current status because all the expected data are not available for our analysis and also it is not easy to judge which data will be taken before the jlab - e07 - 011 data .",
    "because it is one of our purposes to provide a polarized pdf library , which has not been provided since 2003 , we did not include preliminary data such as the rhic run-6 data in our global analyses .",
    "in addition , semi - inclusive data are also not included because we focused our analysis on the determination of @xmath3 and the results depend much on used fragmentation functions . in future",
    ", we expect to make a more complete analysis including the rhic run-6 and semi - inclusive data .",
    "we have investigated the impacts of @xmath0-production data in polarized @xmath24 collisions at rhic and measurements of @xmath6 in the future jlab experiment e07 - 011 on the determination of the polarized pdfs , especially the polarized gluon distribution .",
    "global analyses of the polarized dis were done for determining the polarized pdfs and their uncertainties by using the dis data on @xmath1 , the @xmath0 data of the rhic run-5 , and the expected jlab - e07 - 011 data on @xmath6 .",
    "the rhic @xmath0 data indicated a possibility of a node - type distribution for @xmath3 which changes sign at @xmath25 .",
    "accordingly , we made two types of analyses with positive and node - type distributions for @xmath3 .",
    "similar @xmath26 values were obtained by both analyses although the node - type distributions have slightly smaller @xmath26 .",
    "it suggests that it is difficult to determine a precise gluon distribution from the current data .",
    "however , it is interesting to find in our analyses that the distribution @xmath3 is positive at @xmath27 because of scaling violation in @xmath1 and @xmath0-production data .",
    "we found a large uncertainty for @xmath3 at small @xmath4 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the polarized gluon polarization is significantly reduced by the rhic @xmath0 data . in particular , the @xmath0 data constrain the gluon moment calculated in the large-@xmath4 region ( @xmath23 ) , and the reduction of the gluon uncertainty is 24%@xmath2947% according to our analysis .",
    "there is a clear improvement in the determination of @xmath3 by the future measurements of the e07 - 011 experiment .",
    "it is partially due to the error correlation between the polarized antiquark and gluon distributions .",
    "however , the major improvement comes from the fact that the measurements are accurate enough to probe the polarized gluon distribution in the structure function @xmath1 .",
    "namely , the experimental errors are much smaller than the typical gluonic nlo term in @xmath1 . the e07 - 011 data can reduce the uncertainty of the first moment @xmath22 by about 30@xmath3047% if only the inclusive dis data are used in the analysis .",
    "this reduction is comparable to the effect of the rhic run-5 @xmath0 data .",
    "however , the jlab e07 - 011 data could have an advantage over the hadron - production data because there is no uncertainty coming from the fragmentation functions and the choice of the hard scale . a better determination of @xmath3 should be also made by future measurements of pion , jet , and direct - photon production processes at rhic .",
    "precise dis and collider measurements are important for determining the polarized pdfs , especially in the polarized gluon distribution . from the analyses",
    "b , we provide a code for calculating two sets of optimum polarized pdfs .",
    "the set-1 is for the positive - type pdfs in the analysis b , and the set-2 is for the node - type ones also in the analysis b. the code is provided at our web home page @xcite .",
    "the authors thank n. saito for useful discussions and comments .",
