    "from the point of view of its definition , the simplest statistical system is perhaps the percolation . in the case of the site percolation",
    ", we fill the sites of a given lattice with probability @xmath1 .",
    "then we construct the clusters as sets of contiguous filled sites .",
    "the critical properties of the system can be described in terms of the clusters .",
    "for instance , at the critical percolation the mean cluster size diverges .",
    "we define the percolating cluster as the one that contains , in the thermodynamical limit , an infinite number of sites .",
    "the strength of this cluster ( i.e. the probability of containing an arbitrary point ) is the order parameter of the transition : it is zero for @xmath2 , and finite for @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "another interesting model is the bond percolation . in this case",
    "we fill the lattice bonds with a given probability and construct clusters analogously .",
    "it is believed that both models belong to the same universality class ( share the critical exponents ) .",
    "it is possible to relate the percolation problem ( in the bond version ) with the @xmath4-states potts model using the `` fortuin - kasteleyn '' representation of the latter .",
    "the bond percolation is obtained in the @xmath5 limit @xcite .",
    "moreover it is possible to write down a field theoretical description of the percolation . in general , the potts model is described by means of a @xmath6 theory , where the coefficient of the cubic term is proportional to @xmath7 . for the ising model ( @xmath8 )",
    "this term vanishes , and the leading term is @xmath9 , recovering the standard field theory representation . for @xmath10 we can write @xmath11 , \\label{action3}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath12 depend on the model ( potts , percolation , lee - yang singularities , etc . ) , and @xmath13 is the number of components of the field @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the percolation is described by the action ( [ action3 ] ) in the limit of zero components of the fields .    using the standard tools it is possible to obtain an @xmath0-expansion for this model ( and in particular for the percolation ) .",
    "the power counting tells us that the upper critical dimension of the model is six and thereby the expansion parameter is @xmath15 .",
    "results up to three loops can be found in the literature @xcite .    for large dimensions ( @xmath16 , and , of course , @xmath17 )",
    "there is a good agreement between the results obtained from the @xmath0-expansion ( resumed using pad techniques ) , the values from numerical simulations , and the results from high temperature expansions .    in lower dimensions ,",
    "the results disagree for the anomalous dimension , @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath0-expansion predicts a clear negative value , while in the two dimensional case @xmath18 should be non - negative because the correlation function is decreasing with the distance .",
    "in fact , in this case , it has been conjectured @xcite that @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper we will show that the value of the four dimensional @xmath18 exponent turns out to be large by a @xmath20 , compared to the @xmath0-expansion .",
    "thereby it remains as an open problem to understand why the convergence of the @xmath0-expansion for this model is so poor even for small values of @xmath0  @xcite . in order to calculate critical exponents we extend some recently developed accurate finite - size scaling techniques  @xcite to site percolation . as a benchmark we report the two dimensional critical exponents ( for which there are almost exact analytical estimates ) .",
    "a related model with the site percolation is the diluted ising model @xcite .",
    "it is defined as a standard ising model where the spins live only on filled ( with probability @xmath1 ) sites .",
    "the field theoretical description of this model is a @xmath9-theory with a random mass term . using the replica trick",
    "it can be related with an o(@xmath21 ) symmetric @xmath9 theory with cubic anisotropy , in the limit of zero field components ( i.e. @xmath22 ) @xcite .",
    "the limit of zero temperature ( large @xmath23 ) of the diluted ising model is the site percolation while when @xmath24 it is the pure ising model . a precise determination of the critical exponents of the @xmath25 percolation is also a very useful first step to understand the phase diagram @xmath26 in the diluted ising model . on the other hand ,",
    "the site percolation is useful as a benchmark to develop and test different tools to apply to more complicated systems as the @xmath25 diluted ising model @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that we are specially interested in these four dimensional models in relation with the triviality issue ( is there an interacting continuum limit in four dimensions ? ) . in order to solve",
    "the triviality problem is crucial to characterize all the possible fixed points in four dimensions .",
    "the site percolation has the unusual feature of having the critical dimension at @xmath27 , thus , it does not present the usual mean field exponents at @xmath25 .",
    "we will work in a hypercubic lattice of linear size @xmath28 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) procedure for generating configurations in this model is straightforward : we fill each lattice site with probability @xmath1 .",
    "the next step is to build the clusters , what is a deterministic procedure .",
    "to save computer memory in the larger lattices , we use a self - recurrent algorithm ( in c language ) . in this way",
    "the total memory employed to sketch the clusters is almost negligible ( it grows nearly as the lattice size squared ) .    due to the absence of mc dynamics , the system is specially vulnerable to eventual pathologies of the random number generator .",
    "we have observed significant deviations in some quantities for a commonly used shift register generator @xcite , specially in the larger lattices . to avoid these effects ,",
    "we have used as generator the sum ( modulus 1 ) of the output of the generator of ref .",
    "@xcite and a congruential one , since it is known that their respective drawbacks are very different . ; using as pseudorandom number @xmath29  xor@xmath30 . ]    to define the observables that we measure , it is useful to consider a related model that is a diluted ising model with nearest neighbors infinite coupling , where the spins , @xmath31 , live only in filled sites .",
    "it is easy to show that the magnetization of the latter model , @xmath32 @xmath33 being the volume , coincides with the strength of the percolating cluster in the thermodynamical limit and at @xmath34 .    knowing the size of the clusters ,",
    "as their spins must take the same sign , we can write @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the sign of the cluster c , @xmath37 its size , and the sum runs over all clusters . as @xmath36 are statistically independent , we can construct an improved estimator for even powers of @xmath38 ( the only non - vanishing in a finite lattice ) averaging over all possible values of @xmath39 , that henceforth we will denote as @xmath40 .",
    "for the second power we have @xmath41    we define the susceptibility as @xmath42 to compute the binder parameter @xmath43 we can construct an improved estimator for the fourth power of the magnetization . averaging over signs ,",
    "we obtain after some algebra @xmath44 from which @xmath45    for the finite - size scaling ( fss ) method that we employ , it is very useful an accurate measure of the correlation length .",
    "we have used the second momentum definition  @xcite in the associated ising model , that , in a finite lattice , reads @xmath46 where @xmath47 is defined in terms of the fourier transform of the magnetization @xmath48 as @xmath49    it is also possible to construct an improved estimator for @xmath50 as @xmath51    to measure the critical exponents we use a form of the fss ansatz that only involves measures on a finite lattice . for an operator @xmath52 that diverges as @xmath53 , its mean value in a size @xmath28 lattice can be written , in the critical region , as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a scaling function and @xmath56 is the universal leading corrections - to - scaling exponent . from a renormalization group point of view",
    ", @xmath56 corresponds to the leading irrelevant operator .",
    "we can eliminate the unknown scaling function using the values from two different lattice sizes measuring at a @xmath1 value where the @xmath57 quotients match . specifically , defining @xmath58 we can write @xmath59 other examples of application of this method can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the form of the scaling corrections allows to parameterize the finite - size effect on the determination of the critical exponents as @xmath60    to compute the @xmath56 exponent , we can use equation ( [ fss ] ) for an operator with @xmath61 ( as , for instance , @xmath43 or @xmath57 ) obtaining for the shift of the crossing point of lattice sizes @xmath28 and @xmath62  @xcite    @xmath63 \\propto \\frac{1-s^{-\\omega}}{s^{\\frac{1}{\\nu}}-1}l^{-\\omega-\\frac{1}{\\nu}}. \\label{shiftbeta}\\ ] ]    to efficiently use the fss formulas , it is necessary to use a reweighting method to move in the critical region . for this model",
    "there is not a boltzmann weight , but the role of the energy is carried out by the density of the configuration , and the probability distribution is binomial .    the probability of finding a density @xmath4 when filling sites with a probability @xmath1 is @xmath64 from a set of @xmath21 measures of an observable @xmath52 and the actual density of the configuration @xmath65 we can compute the mean value of the observable for a neighbor density @xmath66 as @xmath67 using equation ( [ reweig ] ) @xmath1-derivatives of observables can also be computed .",
    "obviously we can not extrapolate much further than @xmath68 , which is the dispersion of the distribution  ( [ binomial ] ) .",
    "therefore the visible region decreases as @xmath69 .",
    "fortunately , it is enough for our purposes since to use eq .",
    "( [ quo ] ) we need to move in a neighborhood of the critical point whose size decreases as @xmath70 .",
    "we have produced a million of independent samples for each @xmath71 lattices , with @xmath72 and 48 .    to measure the thermal critical exponent we have used as operators : @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "for the magnetic exponents we have used the susceptibility @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "we remark that , although @xmath77 is a fast varying function of @xmath1 at the critical region ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the use of eq . ( [ quo ] ) allows a very precise measure .",
    "moreover as what we directly measure is the quotient @xmath79 , we can obtain a very accurate determination of the anomalous dimension @xmath18 .",
    "we have checked the method in the @xmath80 case , where there is a very solid conjecture  @xcite for the values of the critical exponents , which is confirmed by conformal group analysis .",
    "we present the measured critical exponents for the two dimensional site percolation in table  [ expo2d ] , obtained from a million of samples for each lattice size .",
    "the conjectured values by nienhuis @xcite are @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the agreement is very good .",
    ".estimates for the critical exponents of two dimensional site percolation obtained from the finite - size scaling analysis using data from lattice sizes @xmath28 and @xmath84 . in the second row",
    "we show the operator used for each column .",
    "practically we can read from the last row the conjectured values . [ cols= \"",

    "@xcite obtained with the @xmath0-expansion .",
    "we are specially interested in the corrections - to - scaling exponent , that is , the derivate of the @xmath23-function at the non trivial fixed point ( i.e. @xmath85 ) . using the @xmath23-function and the non trivial fixed point from ref .",
    "@xcite we have obtained @xmath86 as @xmath87 is large , we have analyzed this series using the pad technique . only the [ 2,1]pad gives consistent results ( i.e. @xmath88 ) .",
    "this agrees with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where in the final pad analysis of their series for the critical exponents only the [ 2,1]pad is reported ( the results of the other pads turned out to be incompatible with the numerical simulation results ) .",
    "we show our results for @xmath56 in table 3 .",
    "we also display in this table the results for the exponents @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath18 calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite using the [ 2,1]pad - borel resummation .",
    "in other cases with @xmath91 a good agreement has been found between resumed series and numerical results .",
    "for the two dimensional ising model the differences in @xmath18 and @xmath56 are @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively ( taking into account the error bars of the @xmath0-expansion estimate of @xmath56)@xcite .",
    "however , we have obtained a discrepancy of @xmath20 in the anomalous dimension and of @xmath94 in the @xmath56-exponent .",
    "linking this discrepancy with the behavior of @xmath18 with the dimension , reported in the introduction , we find the @xmath0-expansion not trustworthy in this case .",
    "using fss techniques we have obtained accurate values for the critical exponents of the four dimensional site percolation .",
    "we have been able to parameterize the leading corrections - to - scaling what allows to largely reduce the systematic errors coming from finite - size effects .",
    "we have obtained an anomalous dimension that is @xmath20 far away from previous numerical and analytical ( @xmath0-expansion ) approaches .",
