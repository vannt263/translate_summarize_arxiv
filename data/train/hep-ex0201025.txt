    "the na49 experiment @xcite offers a unique opportunity of collecting @xmath8 with the same detector @xmath8 data on the full set of available hadronic interactions .",
    "the processes studied range from hadron - nucleon and centrality selected hadron - nucleus interactions to nucleus - nucleus collisions covering a wide range of energies and system sizes .    in the context of this conference preliminary results concerning strange and multistrange baryon production in p+p , centrality selected p+pb at 158 gev / c @xcite , as well as the results on strange baryon @xcite and meson @xcite production from central pb+pb collisions at 40 , 80 and 158 a@xmath6gev , will be presented . a critical discussion - including whenever possible results from other experiments - will attempt to establish common features and differences between elementary and more complex hadronic collisions . the importance of maintaining a broad view on the totality of hadronic processes for the correct interpretation of the observables in specific systems will be emphasized .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 particles are a good measure of the net - baryon density at mid - rapidity due to their charge and isospin neutrality .",
    "an observed ratio @xmath9 @xmath10 1 would imply that the central region is still net - baryon dominated .",
    "this is due to baryon stopping , as refering to the transport of baryon number away from the nuclear fragmentation regions . on the quark level the net - baryon transfer from the projectile and target fragmentation regions to mid - rapidity ,",
    "can generally be described as a transfer of net - quarks ( to be distinguished from the quarks produced in quark - antiquark pairs ) . from this point of view ,",
    "the basic mechanism of net - baryon transfer in p+p , p+a and a+a collisions could be very similar , emphasizing the necessity of a more detailed study of particle production in p+p and p+a collisions .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 multiplicities at mid - rapidity in p+p @xcite collisions is shown in fig .",
    "the averaged yields of @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles from @xmath11+@xmath12 collisions at @xmath13@xmath14200 and @xmath13@xmath14900 gev are shown to indicate the expected @xmath0 and @xmath1 yields at higher energy .",
    "the p+p data for @xmath1 shows a continuous rise with nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energy , @xmath13 . due to",
    "the isospin arguments the number of @xmath1s measures the number of pair - produced @xmath0s .",
    "the data is not conclusive enough , but there is an indication that pair - produced @xmath0s dominate the mid - rapidity yield at energies above @xmath13@xmath1420@xmath830 gev , as a consequence of the very low net - baryon density in this kinematic region .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath9 ratio , which is expected to be 1 if the zero net - baryon density is reached , the ratios of particles which are not charge and isospin neutral ( e.g. @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) are expected to be less than 1 .",
    "this is due to the asymmetric pair production : for example @xmath11@xmath17 , @xmath4@xmath18 , etc .",
    "the high net - baryon density at mid - rapidity at lower energies causes the @xmath0 particles to be singly produced , essentially through the associated production mechanism together with @xmath4 mesons .",
    "available results on singly produced @xmath0s suggest a very steep rise after passing the threshold energy . at higher @xmath13 , where the pair - produced lambdas start to contribute dominantly , the yield of singly produced @xmath0s is steeply falling .",
    "the sum of these two contributions shows a minimum arround @xmath13@xmath14 25 gev , as a border between the regions of high and low net - baryon density ( see fig .",
    "1a ) .    preliminary na49 data @xcite ( squares in fig .",
    "1a ) shows that approximately 40% of the @xmath0s at mid - rapidity are pair - produced , and 60% singly - produced , in associated production with @xmath4 .",
    "different particle @xmath19 spectra are expected for different production mechanisms .",
    "this correlation is demonstrated in fig .",
    "1b which shows the normalized @xmath19 distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 hyperons measured at mid - rapidity .",
    "the steeper @xmath19 slope observed for the @xmath1s ( pair produced @xmath0s ) than for the @xmath0s ( singly and pair produced @xmath0s ) suggests that the @xmath19 spectra clearly depend on the particle production mechanism .",
    "an interesting question is how this matches the physics assumptions of the statistical model , regardless of its success in describing particle yields from p+p interactions .",
    "results from a+a collisions are ploted in fig .",
    "preliminary na49 data @xcite on @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at mid - rapidity ( squares ) are compared to other experiments @xcite @xcite ( circles ) .",
    "although at the same energy a+a data shows a higher degree of stopping than p+p data , it is interesting to note a striking similarity in the energy dependence of these two data sets .",
    "both samples show that @xmath0 production at mid - rapidity is strongly correlated with the change with @xmath13 of the net - baryon density . for a better understanding of the physical origin of the net - baryon transfer and its correlation to particle production ,",
    "the precise p+p and a+a rhic data , from the lowest up to top accesible energies , are needed .",
    "it is not excluded that the mid - rapidity @xmath0 yield in a+a collisions will show a minimum , like it was observed in p+p .",
    "a different origin of this minimum is also not excluded . in p+p",
    "this could indicate the energy region with ( almost ) zero net - baryon density , and in a+a the region where the net - baryon density at mid - rapidity starts to saturate towards a non - zero value .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 mid - rapidity multiplicities in central a+a collisions is shown in fig .  2b ( preliminary na49 data @xcite are indicated by squares ) .",
    "due to the associated production of @xmath4 with @xmath0 particles at lower energies one would expect a similar behaviour of singly produced @xmath0 baryons and singly produced @xmath4 mesons . the results on the energy dependence of the @xmath4 @xmath8 @xmath5 and @xmath0 @xmath8 @xmath1 yields at mid - rapidity , shown in fig .",
    "3a , confirm this expectation .",
    "we want to emphasize that the energy dependence of the @xmath0 @xmath8 @xmath1 yield at mid - rapidity in p+p ( see fig .",
    "1a ) shows a similar pattern .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding @xmath4 and @xmath5 data at lower energies are still missing .",
    "before we proceed with the results on the strangeness to pion multiplicity ratios , we would like to comment on the energy dependence of pion multiplicities observed in a+a and p+a collisions . in order to study this dependence , we define the double ratio of multiplicities per wounded nucleon @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the mean number of negative particles and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the mean number of wounded nucleons in b+a ( n+n ) collisions .",
    "3b shows the dependence of the double ratio @xmath25/ @xmath26 on the fermi energy f=@xmath27 for the protons on light ( a@xmath2864 ) ( triangles ) and heavy ( a@xmath29108 ) ( stars ) nuclei , together with the results from a+a collisions ( circles ) @xcite .",
    "preliminary na49 data are indicated by squares . in the wounded - nucleon - model ( wnm )",
    "@xcite it is assumed that the number of produced particles depends only on the total number of wounded nucleons @xmath30 participating in the collisions , and not on the number of collisions per participating nucleon . under this assumption the ratio @xmath25/ @xmath26 @xmath14 1 .",
    "the a+a results from fig .",
    "3b show that the wnm overpredicts the @xmath31 yield at lower energies ( @xmath25/ @xmath26 @xmath32 1 ) and underpredicts at higher energies ( @xmath25/ @xmath26 @xmath33 1 ) .",
    "before we interpret this @xmath31 enhancement , relative to the wnm , as an entropy enhancement and a phase transition indication a similar behaviour in p+a has to be critically considered ( see fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observed @xmath25/ @xmath26 ratio is larger for the p reactions on light nuclei than on heavy nuclei .",
    "this may indicate that the wnm overestimates the number of the participating nucleons in the proton collisions on heavy nuclei .    because of the similarity in the production of @xmath0 particles at mid - rapidity in p+p and a+a collisions , it is not surprising that the energy dependence of the @xmath0/@xmath7 ratio at mid - rapidity in p+p and a+a shows a similar behaviour : non - monotonic , passing through a maximum around @xmath13=4@xmath87 gev ( fig .",
    "4a ) .    the p+a and a+a data show ( upper part of fig .",
    "4b ) that the @xmath4/@xmath34 ratio is affected similarly , due to the associated production of @xmath4 together with @xmath0 particles at lower energies , where the net - baryon density is still high . while a continuous rise in @xmath5@xmath35@xmath36 from ags over sps to rhic energies is observed in a+a data ( lower part of fig .",
    "4b ) , the @xmath4@xmath35@xmath34 ratio in p+a and a+a data reaches a maximum approximately at the energy where the maximum in the @xmath0@xmath35@xmath7 ratio is observed .",
    "consequently , it may be premature to conclude that a rapid change of the energy dependence of strangeness to pion ( entropy ) ratio is a unique signal for the transition from confined to deconfined matter .",
    "from this point of view the study of baryon and anti - baryon production in p+p and p+a collisions , starting with the low ags energies , and going up to the top rhic energy , will be extremely important for a better understanding of baryon propagation in rapidity and/or @xmath37 space in a+a interactions .",
    "in addition to the similarity between p+p and a+a data , the energy dependence of the @xmath0/@xmath7 ratio ( fig .",
    "4a ) also shows an important difference .",
    "the @xmath0/@xmath7 ratio in a+a collisions is several times larger than the corresponding ratio in minimum bias p+p collisions .",
    "the wa97 experiment @xcite has found that the strange particle yields ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath38 + @xmath39 ) per wounded nucleon @xmath30 at central rapidity increase from p+pb to pb+pb .",
    "the enhancement , relative to the prediction of the wnm is found to be more pronounced for multistrange particles , and more pronounced for particles than for anti - particles .",
    "the relevant question is : does the simple wnm scaling hold between p+p and p+a interactions ?",
    "5 shows the ratios of hyperon multiplicities produced in centrality selected p+pb and minimum bias p+p collisions versus rapidity @xcite .",
    "the centrality of p+pb reactions is characterized by the mean number of projectile collisions @xmath40= @xmath30@xmath81 .",
    "the experimental results for the first ( @xmath41@xmath14 3.7 ) and the second ( @xmath41@xmath14 5.7 ) centrality bin are shown by full and open squares , respectively .",
    "the predictions of the wnm at backward ( @xmath42@xmath14@xmath40 ) , central ( @xmath42@xmath14@xmath43 ) and forward ( @xmath42@xmath14@xmath44 ) rapidities are indicated by solid lines . as already observed in pb+pb collisions @xcite ,",
    "the mid - rapidity enhancement in p+pb , relative to the wnm prediction , is larger for particles of higher strangeness content and is larger for baryons than for antibaryons .",
    "although the yield of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 hyperons scales approximately with @xmath40 as predicted by the wnm ( not shown here ) , it is important to emphasize that their absolute yield is enhanced .",
    "the yield of @xmath1 is close to the wnm for the most central sample .    in the backward rapidity region",
    "there is also a clear indication for the enhanced production of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 particles relative to the wnm model , similar to the effect observed at the mid - rapidity region .",
    "the observed enhancement of strange and multistrange baryons in p+pb suggests that any extrapolation from elementary to nucleus - nucleus collisions using the simple wnm is questionable , as well as the conclusions based on the result of this extrapolation . before one can conclude that the enhancement with respect to the wnm seen in a+a is a sign for qgp formation @xcite , one has to study carefully the consequences of the multiple collision mechanisms as they become accesible in p+a interactions .    a short summary of presented data , to emphasize again the importance of energy and system size dependence study ,",
    "is shown in fig .  6 in the form of antibaryon to baryon ratios at mid - rapidity for p+p , centrality selected p+pb , central pb+pb at @xmath4517.2 gev , as well as central au+au at @xmath45130 gev .",
    "the `` slope '' of the antibaryon to baryon ratios at a given energy becomes flatter ( going from @xmath15 to @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) as the size of the colliding system ( going from a+a to p+p ) , and consequently the net - baryon density at mid - rapidity , decreases .",
    "a similar effect is obtained by increasing the energy and keeping ( approximately ) the same system size ( compare particle ratios from the central pb+pb and au+au collisions at sps and rhic energies , respectively ) .",
    "the ratios of @xmath48 will be affected in a similar way since the production of the @xmath4 mesons is strongly correlated with change of the net - baryon density , as it was discussed before .",
    "it would be very interesting to compare the antibaryon to baryon ratios in p+p and a+a at the different energies at which they have approximately the same @xmath48 ratio .",
    "in doing so the isospin effect should be carefully taken into account .",
    "the na49 collaboration at the cern sps has measured strange hyperons in minimum bias p+p and centrality selected p+pb reactions at 158 gev / c , and @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 particles in central pb+pb collisions at 40 , 80 and 158 a@xmath6gev .",
    "a steeper @xmath19 slope is observed in p+p reactions for @xmath1s ( pair produced @xmath0s ) than for the @xmath0s ( pair and non - pair produced @xmath0s ) reflecting their different production mechanisms .",
    "it should be critically considered how this matches the physics assumptions of the statistical model regardless of its success in describing particle yields in p+p reactions .",
    "the same question concerns the applicability of the statistical model in describing the particle yields in the fragmentation region of a+a reactions .    by comparing the energy dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at mid - rapidity",
    ", a striking similarity is observed between p+p and a+a data .",
    "this is also seen in the energy dependence of the @xmath0/@xmath7 ratio @xmath8 non - monotonic , passing through a maximum around @xmath13@xmath144@xmath87 gev .",
    "the @xmath4/@xmath7 ratio at mid - rapidity is affected similarly in p+a and a+a interactions due to the associated production of @xmath4 together with @xmath0 particles , in particular at the lower energies where the net - baryon density is still relatively high . from this",
    "we conclude that a rapid change of energy dependence of strangeness to pion ( entropy ) ratio may not be a unique characteristic of heavy - ion reactions .    comparing the yields of produced hyperons in p+p and p+pb reactions an excess of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "is observed relative to the prediction of the wounded - nucleon - model .",
    "this excess shows a similar pattern to the one observed in pb+pb data , indicating that the extrapolation to a+a using the wnm is questionable , as well as the conclusions based on this extrapolation .",
    "we would like to stress that the observed similarity between p+p , p+a and a+a reactions does not prove that a+a is a simple superposition of p+p and/or p+a .",
    "it shows however , that a deeper understanding of p+p and p+a data is necessary for any interpretation of a+a reactions .",
