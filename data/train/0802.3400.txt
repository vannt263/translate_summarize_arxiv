    "the theory of quantum chaos concerns with the quantum systems whose classical limit is chaotic . it is assumed in general ,",
    "that chaotic dynamics induce certain characteristic patterns .",
    "for instance , the random matrix conjecture predicts that statistical distribution of high - lying eigenvalues in a chaotic system is the same as in certain ensembles of random matrices and depends only on symmetries of the system @xcite . in the same spirit , it is believed that eigenstates of chaotic systems are delocalized over the whole available part of the phase space @xcite , @xcite which is totally different from the case of integrable dynamics , where eigenstates are known to concentrate near kam tori @xcite .",
    "the rigorous implementation of that idea is known as _",
    "quantum ergodicity theorem_. it was first proven by a. i. schnirelman for laplacians on surfaces of negative curvature @xcite and later generalized @xcite , @xcite and extended to other systems e.g. , ergodic billiards @xcite , quantized maps @xcite and general hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "very generally , the quantum ergodicity theorem states that for a classically ergodic system `` almost all '' eigenstates in the semiclassical regime become uniformly distributed over the phase space . to give the precise meaning of such a statement it is convenient to use the notion of measure . for a hamiltonian system a sequence of the eigenstates @xmath1 generates the corresponding sequence of the measures @xmath2 on the classical phase space , where the density @xmath3 can be interpreted as the `` distribution '' of @xmath4 over the phase space .",
    "although the exact form of @xmath5 depends on the quantization procedure ( e.g. , weyl , anti - wick quantization etc . ) , the limiting _",
    "semiclassical measure _ : @xmath6 is invariant under the corresponding classical flow and does not depend on the choice of the quantization .",
    "the quantum ergodicity theorem asserts that for `` almost all '' sequences of the eigenstates the limiting measure @xmath0 is actually the liouville measure .",
    "since the quantum ergodicity theorem does not exclude possibility that exceptional sequences of eigenstates produce non - liouville classically invariant measures , it makes sense to ask whether such measures might actually appear . in the context of anosov geodesic flows on surfaces of negative curvature",
    "it was conjectured @xcite that a typical system posses _ `` quantum unique ergodicity '' _ property , meaning that all sequences of eigenstates converge to the liouville measure .",
    "however , there have been only a limited number of rigorous results supporting this conjecture .",
    "so far , the most important one was obtained by e. lindenstrauss . in @xcite",
    "he proved that all hecke eigenstates of the laplacian on compact arithmetic surfaces are equidistributed .",
    "if ( as widely believed ) all the laplacian eigenstates are non - degenerate , this result would amount to the proof of quantum unique ergodicity for the arithmetic case . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that exceptional sequences actually do appear in some quantum systems . for quantum `` cat maps ''",
    "such sequences were identified in @xcite @xcite .",
    "the limiting measure there could be , for instance , composed of two ergodic components : @xmath7 where the first part @xmath8 is the liouville measure equidistributed over the whole phase space and the second part @xmath9 is the dirac peak concentrated on a single unstable periodic orbit .",
    "similar sequences of eigenstates have been also constructed for the ",
    "walsh quantization  of the baker s",
    ". for quantized hyperbolic automorphisms of higher - dimensional tori there exists a different type of semiclassical measures which are lebesgue measures on some invariant co - isotropic subspaces of the torus @xcite .    as we know that non - liouville semiclassical measures do appear ( at least ) in some systems",
    ", it would be of great interest to understand which kind of them might exist in a general case .",
    "quite recently , it has been proven by n. anantharaman and s. nonnenmacher @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( with h. koch ) that for the laplacian on a compact riemannian manifold with anosov geodesic flow the metric ( kolmogorov - sinai ) entropy @xmath10 of any semiclassical measure @xmath0 must satisfy certain bound .",
    "particularly , in the two - dimensional case the following result holds @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the unstable jacobian of the flow at the point @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the maximum expansion rate of the flow .",
    "if the maximum expansion rate is close to its average value , this remarkable bound gives a valuable information on @xmath0 itself .",
    "in particular , for surfaces with a constant negative curvature this remarkable bound implies that maximum `` half '' of the measure might concentrate on periodic orbits . on the other hand ,",
    "if the expansion rate varies a lot , the above bound does not give any information , as the right hand side of ( [ stheor ] ) becomes negative .",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that ( [ stheor ] ) is not an optimal result , and a stronger bound might exist in a general case .",
    "such a bound has been conjectured in @xcite .",
    "it states that for chaotic systems a semiclassical measure must satisfy : @xmath15 assuming that the conjecture is true , it provides a restriction on the class of possible semiclassical measures in general case .",
    "in particular , for semiclassical measures of the type ( [ nonmeasure ] ) the bound ( [ sconj ] ) would imply that liouville part should be always present and its proportion satisfy @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the average laypunov exponent ( with respect to the liouville measure ) and @xmath18 is the laypunov exponent for the periodic orbit where @xmath9 is localized .",
    "the central purpose of this paper is to provide support for the conjectured bound ( [ sconj ] ) using the model of quantized one - dimensional piecewise linear maps .",
    "a procedure for quantization of one - dimensional linear maps was originally introduced in @xcite in order to generate families of quantum graphs with some special properties .",
    "being much simpler on the technical level , these models still exhibit characteristic properties of typical quantum chaotic hamiltonian systems .",
    "most importantly , it turns out that the quantum evolution here follows the classical evolution till the ( ehrenfest ) time which grows logarithmically with the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "note also that , as will be shown in the body of the paper , the construction is closely related to the walsh quantized baker s maps in @xcite .    in the present work we will consider lebesgue measure preserving maps @xmath19\\to [ 0,1]=:i$ ] consisting of several linear branches . more specifically ,",
    "let @xmath20 be a partition of the unite interval @xmath21 into @xmath22 subintervals . at each subinterval @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath24 is then defined as a simple linear map @xmath25 : @xmath26    we consider maps @xmath24 of the form ( [ mapgeneral ] ) satisfying the following conditions :    * @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 are integers larger then one . *",
    "each subinterval @xmath23 is mapped by @xmath24 upon the whole unite interval @xmath30 .",
