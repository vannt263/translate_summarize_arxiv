    "sulfur is an abundant element ( the solar photosphere abundance is s / h=1.38@xmath710@xmath8 ) , which remains undepleted in diffuse interstellar gas and hii regions but it is traditionally assumed to deplete on grains in higher density molecular clouds by factors as large as @xmath21000 . this conclusion is _ simply _ reached by adding up the observed gas phase abundances of s  bearing molecules in well known dark clouds such as tmc1 . as sulfur is easily ionized ( ionization potential @xmath210.36  ev ) , sulfur ions are probably the dominant gas  phase sulfur species in translucent gas .",
    "ruffle et al .",
    "( 1999 ) proposed that if dust grains are typically negatively charged , s@xmath5 may freeze  out onto dust grains during cloud collapse more efficiently than neutral species such as oxygen .",
    "however , the nature of sulphur on dust grains ( either in mantles or cores ) is not obvious . the absence of strong ir features due to s  bearing ices in many iso s mid  ir spectra and the presence of sii recombination lines in dark clouds such as rho ophiuchi all argue against a large depletion of sulfur from the gas phase . besides",
    ", the abundance of species such as cs or h@xmath6s may indicate that something important is lacking from chemical models or that an abundant sulfur  bearing carrier has been missed .",
    "therefore , the abundances of sulfur species remain interesting puzzles for interstellar chemistry .",
    "pdrs offer an ideal intermediate medium between diffuse and dark cloud gas to investigate the sulfur depletion problem . in particular , the horsehead western edge is a pdr viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "the intensity of the incident fuv radiation field is @xmath9 relative to the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) in draine s units . at a distance of 400 pc ,",
    "the horsehead pdr is very close to the prototypical source needed to serve as a reference to models ( pety et al .",
    "2006 ) .        since 2001",
    "we have been studying the horsehead nebula at high angular resolution ( @xmath10 ) with the iram pdbi interferometer , and complemented with larger scale and higher frequency observations with the iram-30 m single  dish telescope . following these and other works",
    ", the horsehead pdr is now considered a well understood source , ideal to analyse the chemical stratification predicted in clouds illuminated by a fuv radiation field ( see pety et al .",
    "these proceedings ) .",
    "these studies have led e.g. , to a significant increase of our knowledge of the carbon chemistry ( from pahs to small hydrocarbons ) in fuv irradiated gas ( see gerin et al . 2005 ; pety et al .",
    "more recently , we have tried to accurately determine and understand the observed cs and hcs@xmath5 abundances in the horsehead pdr as a tool for estimating the sulfur gas phase abundance .",
    "compared to other works , we now specifically treat the nonlocal , non - lte molecular excitation and radiative transfer along the cloud edge using the output predictions of photochemical models . in this way , we can consistently link the thermal and chemical predictions of pdr models with the absolute molecular line intensities detected by telescopes .",
    "this , sometimes difficult , step has a crucial importance in the accurate determination of abundances and in our understanding of the prevailing chemistry and physical conditions by a direct comparison of pdr models with molecular line emissivities .    in this work we present @xmath11 angular resolution iram _ plateau de bure interferometer _ observations of the cs @xmath4=21 line ( fig .",
    "2  _ left _ ) , complemented with iram30 m observations of several rotational lines of cs , c@xmath12s , hcs@xmath5 , so , @xmath12so , h@xmath6s , etc .",
    "( some of them shown in fig .  1 ) .",
    "beam sizes of single  dish observations range from @xmath210@xmath3 at 1  mm to @xmath230@xmath3 at 3  mm .",
    "data reduction was done with the iram gildas software .",
    "to analyse the gas phase sulfur chemistry we use the _ meudon pdr code _ , a photochemical model of a unidimensional stationary pdr ( le petit et al .",
    "2006 ) . in few words ,",
    "the pdr code solves the fuv radiative transfer in an absorbing and diffusing medium of gas and dust ( goicoechea & le bourlot 2007 ) .",
    "this allows the explicit computation of the fuv radiation field ( continuum+lines ) and therefore , the explicit integration of consistent c and s photoionization rates together with h@xmath6 , co , @xmath13co , and c@xmath14o photodissociation rates .",
    "our standard conditions for the model of the horsehead pdr include a power  law density profile and a fuv radiation field enhanced by a factor @xmath15 with respect to the draine isrf .",
    "different sulfur gas phase abundances , s / h , have been investigated ( see fig .  2  _ right _ ) . to be consistent with pdbi co multi - line observations ,",
    "the thermal balance was solved until the gas temperature reached a minimum value of 30  k , then a constant temperature was assumed .    for the molecular excitation and radiative transfer in the pdr we use a nonlocal , non  lte monte carlo code that allows us to directly compare our millimeter line observations .",
    "the code handles spherical and plane - parallel geometries and accounts for line trapping , collisional excitation , and radiative excitation by absorption of microwave cosmic background and dust continuum photons .",
    "arbitrary density , temperature or abundance profiles , and complex velocity gradients can be included .",
    "a detailed description of the model is given in goicoechea ( 2003 ) and goicoechea et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the following methodology was carried out : a full pdr model with horsehead standard conditions was run with a particular choice of the density gradient .",
    "afterwards , the pdr output was used as input for the excitation and radiative transfer calculation . in this way",
    ", physical parameters can be tuned more accurately by iteration of different radiative transfer models .",
    "once better parameters have been found , a new pdr computation is performed with this choice of physical parameters .",
    "we have so far analyzed cs , c@xmath12s , c@xmath14o and hcs@xmath5 species .",
    "synthetic abundance profiles are consistently computed as a function of the edge distance @xmath16 ( in arcsec ) and directly compared with interferometric observations ( see fig .",
    "we are now analyzing a larger collection of sulfur bearing molecules .",
    "we have analyzed interferometric cs @xmath4=21 line maps of the horsehead pdr at a @xmath11 resolution together with single ",
    "dish observations of several rotational lines of cs , c@xmath12s and",
    "hcs@xmath5 . we have studied the cs photochemistry , excitation and radiative transfer using the latest hcs@xmath5 and ocs@xmath5 dissociative recombination rates ( montaigne et al . 2005 ) and cs collisional cross  sections ( lique et al .",
    "the main conclusions are as follows ( the whole work can be found in goicoechea et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) :    1 .",
    "cs and c@xmath12s rotational line emission reveals mean densities around @xmath17)=(0.51.0)@xmath710@xmath18  @xmath19 .",
    "the cs @xmath4=54 lines show narrower line widths than the low@xmath4 cs lines and require higher density gas components , @xmath2(26)@xmath710@xmath18  @xmath19 , not resolved by a @xmath210@xmath3 beam .",
    "these values are larger than previous estimates based on co single  dish observations .",
    "it is likely that clumpiness at scales below @xmath20.01  pc and/or a low density envelope play a role in the cs line profile formation .",
    "nonlocal , non  lte radiative transfer models of optically thick cs lines and optically thin c@xmath12s lines provide an accurate determination of the cs abundance , @xmath20(cs)=(7@xmath213)@xmath710@xmath22 .",
    "we show that radiative transfer and opacity effects play a role in the resulting cs line profiles but not in c@xmath12s lines . assuming the same physical conditions for the hcs@xmath5 molecular ion",
    ", we find @xmath20(hcs@xmath23)=(4@xmath212)@xmath710@xmath24 .",
    "3 .   according to photochemical models , the gas phase sulfur abundance required to reproduce these cs and hcs@xmath5 abundances is s / h=(3.5@xmath211.5)@xmath710@xmath25 , only a factor @xmath24 less abundant than the solar elemental abundance .",
    "larger sulfur abundances are possible if the gas is significantly warmer .",
    "thus , the sulfur abundance in the pdr is very close to the undepleted value observed in the diffuse ism .",
    "the predicted cs / hcs@xmath5 abundance ratio is close to the observed value of @xmath2175 , especially if predicted hcs@xmath5 peak abundances are considered . if not , the hcs@xmath5 production is underestimated unless the gas is in a higher ionization phase , e.g. if the cosmic ray ionization rate is increased by @xmath25 .",
    "we are currently working on a larger inventory of sulfur  bearing molecules detected by us in the horsehead pdr to test other limitations of the sulfur chemical network .",
    "high angular resolution pdbi maps reveal that the cs emission does not follow the same morphology shown by the small hydrocarbons emission the pdr edge ( pety et al .",
    "2005 ) . in combination with previous pdbi c@xmath14o observations",
    "we have modeled the pdr edge and confirmed that a steep density gradient ( see habart et al .",
    "2005 ) is needed to reproduce cs and c@xmath14o observations .",
    "the resulting density profile qualitatively agrees to that predicted in numerical simulations of a shock front compressing the pdr edge to high densities , @xmath17)@xmath2610@xmath18  @xmath19 , and high thermal pressures , @xmath26(510)@xmath710@xmath27  k  @xmath19 .",
    "5 .   conventional pdr heating and cooling mechanisms fail to reproduce the temperature of the warm gas observed in the region by at least a factor @xmath22 .",
    "additional mechanical heating mechanisms associated with the gas dynamics may be needed to account for the warm gas .",
    "the thermal structure of the pdr edge is still not fully constrained from observations .",
    "this fact adds uncertainty to the abundances predicted by photochemical models .",
    "observational studies of ism clouds show that many physical and chemical variations occur at very small angular scales . for pdrs , an accurate molecular inventory , as a function of the distance from the illuminating source ,",
    "can only be obtained from interferometric observations .",
    "aperture synthesis observations contain detailed information about density , temperature , abundance and structure of the cloud , but only specific radiative transfer and photochemical models for each given source are able to extract the information . a minimum description of the source geometry is usually needed .",
    "future observations with alma will allow us to finally characterize pdrs at the appropriate spatial scales of their physical and chemical gradients .",
