    "the study of topological spaces and the related computational methods are receiving an unprecedented attention from fields as diverse as biology and social sciences @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the original motivation of this work is to provide a firm mathematical background for the results obtained in @xcite , where the authors defined a filtration of a weighted network directly in terms of edge weights .",
    "the rationale behind this was the observation that embedding a network into a metric space generally obfuscates most of its interesting structures @xcite , which become instead evident when one focuses on the weighted connectivity structures without enforcing a metric .",
    "figure [ example_figure ] illustrates this through the @xmath3 and @xmath4 persistent diagrams for two different filtrations obtained from a dataset of face - to - face contacts among children in an elementary school ( see the sociopatterns project @xcite for details ) .",
    "the _ metrical filtration _ is obtained in the standard way : given a metric ( weighted shortest path in this case ) , one constructs a sequence of rips - vietoris complexes by studying the change in the overlap of @xmath5-neighbourhoods of vertices while varying their radius @xmath5 ( figure [ example_figure ] right ) .",
    "the non metrical one relies instead on associating clique complexes to a series of binary networks obtained from a progressively descending thresholding on edge weights ( figure [ example_figure ] left ) .",
    "the difference between the diagrams of the two filtration is evident : in the first case , most of the generators have short persistent and are thus distributed along the diagonal ; in the second generators display a range of persistents , including some very large ones that signal the presence of interesting heterogeneities in the network structure .",
    "more interestingly , we will see that the attempt at providing a mathematical formalisation of the approach used in @xcite yields a much more general result regarding @xmath2 persistent homology .",
    "+ in order to obtain this result , we need to introduce a number of notions . in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ pers ] ) we briefly define the notion of @xmath2persistence , which is our main object of study .",
    "subsequently we lay down the vocabulary needed , introducing finite topological spaces and their equivalence to partially ordered sets , the relation between simplicial complexes , their associated order complexes and graphs .",
    "finally , in section [ hom ] we introduce the homology and prove the theorem in section [ onegraph ] , highlighting how the metrical case is only a specific and constrained case of the possible network weightings .",
    "let us recall the definition of poset .",

    "we want to start with a few considerations on finite topological spaces i.e. topological spaces with a finite number of elements , which we can imagine to be given as some sampling taken from a dataset .",
    "finiteness is not a constraint for our purposes , since every application will have a finite data space , although possibly very large .",

    "it is clear that this property is highly desirable in order to be able to extract meaningful information from a topological space .    in this paper",
