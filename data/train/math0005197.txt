    "it is well known that the theory of knot invariants of finite type ( or vassiliev invariants ) is closely connected with lie algebras .",
    "the aim of this paper is to clarify this relationship and give it a precise formulation .",
    "knot invariants of finite type are related to various areas of mathematics and theoretical physics and have been in the focus of very intensive research ever since v.vassiliev introduced them in 1989 .",
    "one of the remarkable features of these invariants is that they can be completely characterized in terms of combinatorial objects called weight systems .",
    "a weight system is a function on chord diagrams ( configurations of pairs of points on a circle ) satisfying certain relations .",
    "the dual space @xmath0 of the space of weight systems is generated by chord diagrams and has a natural structure of a graded commutative and cocommutative hopf algebra .",
    "it is called _ the algebra of chord diagrams_.    bar - natan  @xcite and kontsevich  @xcite discovered a construction that gives a family of vassiliev invariants for every finite - dimensional lie algebra with a metric ( an invariant inner product ) . according to calculations of j.kneissler  @xcite ,",
    "all invariants up to order @xmath6 come from lie algebras .",
    "however for large orders this is not true , and there exists a more general construction that gives vassiliev invariants which can not be obtained from lie algebras .",
    "this construction was found by the second author in  @xcite as a byproduct of an attempt to understand the relationship between lie algebras and invariants of knots .",
    "it turned out that the theory of vassiliev invariants naturally leads to the concept of a yang - baxter lie algebra , an algebraic structure generalizing lie algebras and lie superalgebras , and they in turn can be used to produce knot invariants .",
    "namely , every metric yang - baxter lie algebra @xmath7 gives an algebra homomorphism @xmath8 with values in the center of the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath7 .",
    "every linear functional on @xmath9 produces a sequence of vassiliev invariants .",
    "the existence of homomorphism @xmath10 is not the only indication of the lie - type behavior of the algebra @xmath0 of chord diagrams . in particular , @xmath0 can be described as the space generated by certain ( ribbon ) graphs ( also known as chinese characters ) modulo some relations and the proof of this fact ( see  @xcite ) is strikingly parallel to the proof of the  theorem for lie algebras .",
    "this raises a natural question whether the algebra @xmath0 can be described as the center of the universal enveloping algebra of a lie - type object which is universal with respect to morphisms  ( [ eq : atoug ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that this is , indeed , the case and prove , in particular , that every vassiliev invariant factors through the homomorphism @xmath10 for some @xmath7 .",
    "this universal object , however , can not be found among yang - baxter lie algebras , and to define it we need to move to a slightly higher level of abstraction .",
    "metric lie algebras can be defined not only in the category of vector spaces , but in arbitrary linear tensor category .",
    "one can construct a metric lie algebra @xmath11 in a certain category @xmath12 universal in the sense that every metric lie algebra in a tensor category @xmath13 is the image of @xmath11 under a unique tensor functor @xmath14 .",
    "a lie algebra @xmath7 in a tensor category has a universal enveloping algebra @xmath15 which is an ordinary associative algebra in the category of vector spaces . the collection of maps  ( [ eq : atoug ] )",
    "can now be described as an algebra homomorphism @xmath16 .",
    "this homomorphism however is not an isomorphism , and the starting point of our work was to understand to which extent it determines the algebra @xmath0 .",
    "an appropriate setup is provided by the more general notion of a casimir lie algebra ( i.e.  lie algebra with an invariant symmetric two - tensor ) . similarly to the case of metric lie algebras , we construct the universal casimir lie algebra @xmath17 in a certain tensor category @xmath18 and a homomorphism @xmath19 .",
    "one of the main results of the paper is that this map is an isomorphism .",
    "this result can be derived from injectivity of the natural map @xmath20 which , in turn , follows from a detailed analysis of the categories @xmath18 and @xmath12 .    to present the main constructions and results of the paper we need to use the language of operads and props .",
    "the notion of operad appeared in algebraic topology in late 60s as a tool for describing algebraic operations on iterated loop spaces . in algebra ,",
    "operads are used to encode classes of algebraic structures ( algebras over operads ) with collections of polylinear operations of type @xmath21 satisfying specific properties . in particular",
    ", there exists an operad called @xmath4 , such that @xmath4-algebras in different tensor categories include `` usual '' lie algebras , lie superalgebras , as well as dg - lie algebras and yang - baxter lie algebras . for every operad @xmath22",
    "there exists a free @xmath22-algebra with a given set of generators .",
    "an invariant inner product on an algebra @xmath23 over a field @xmath24 can be considered as an operation @xmath25 .",
    "the notions of  and algebras over s have been designed to handle this and more general operations of type @xmath26 .",
    "as in the case of operads , the formalism of props allows to define algebras in arbitrary tensor categories .  itself is a very small tensor category : its objects are natural numbers @xmath27 with the tensor structure given by addition .",
    "mentioned above categories @xmath12 and @xmath18 are , in fact , props , such that the corresponding algebras are exactly metric and casimir lie algebras . in particular , the objects @xmath28 are lie algebras in the corresponding categories and they can be viewed as the universal metric lie algebra and the universal casimir lie algebra respectively .    similarly to the definition of an enveloping algebra of an algebra over an operad",
    "( see  @xcite , sect .",
    "3 ) , one can consider two different versions of a universal enveloping algebra of the lie algebra @xmath29 ( resp .",
    "@xmath30 ) .",
    "the first , _ internal _ universal enveloping algebra , is an associative algebra in a certain extension of the category @xmath18 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) .",
    "the second , _ external _ universal enveloping algebra , is a genuine associative algebra .",
    "this algebra can be described as a collection of compatible endomorphisms of all representations of @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) .",
    "the homomorphisms  ( [ eq : atoug ] ) giving vassiliev invariants for arbitrary metric yang - baxter lie algebras now can be interpreted as a single algebra homomorphism @xmath31 from the algebra of chord diagrams to the external enveloping algebra of the universal metric lie algebra @xmath29 .",
    "a precise lie - theoretical description of the algebra of chord diagrams is obtained when we replace metric lie algebras by casimir lie algebras .",
    "the following theorem is the central result of the paper .",
    "th : main there exists an algebra isomorphism @xmath32 from the external enveloping algebra of the universal casimir lie algebra @xmath30 to the algebra @xmath0 of chord diagrams .    as an immediate consequence",
    ", we see that each casimir lie algebra @xmath7 gives rise to a homomorphism from @xmath0 to the center of the enveloping algebra of @xmath7 and that every vassiliev invariant can be obtained from a casimir lie algebra in some tensor category .",
    "this explains the similarities between the algebra of chord diagrams and lie algebras .",
    "in particular , the above - mentioned description of the algebra @xmath0 in terms of chinese characters follows from the  theorem for @xmath33 .",
    "another immediate corollary of this theorem is the conjecture of bar - natan , garoufalidis , rozansky , and thurston  @xcite on the existence of a kirillov - duflo - type isomorphism for algebras of chord diagrams .",
    "a large part of our results and constructions for metric and casimir lie algebras remains true if the operad @xmath4 is replaced by an arbitrary _ cyclic operad _ @xmath22 . in particular",
    ", we construct a  @xmath34 describing @xmath22-algebras endowed with an invariant symmetric two - tensor .",
    "it turns out that the operadic part @xmath35 of @xmath34 has an extra structure  that of a _ modular operad_. moreover , the functor @xmath36 is a left adjoint to the natural `` tree part '' functor from modular operads to cyclic operads .",
    "we give an explicit construction of @xmath35 in terms of @xmath22 .",
    "the  @xmath34 can be expressed through @xmath35 in a simple way .",
    "similarly , the  @xmath37 also can be described in terms of @xmath35 .",
    "the explicit description of props @xmath34 and @xmath37 allows one to deduce the following result which is the key ingredient in our characterization of the algebra @xmath0 .",
    "the natural morphism of s @xmath38 induces an isomorphism @xmath39    when @xmath40 this theorem implies in particular that all vassiliev invariants can be obtained from a metric lie algebra .",
    "another interesting example is the case when @xmath41 , the operad for homotopy lie algebras . in this case",
    "the space of morphisms in @xmath42 coincides with kontsevich s graph complex .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the constructions and results of the first part ( sections 2  4 ) are valid for arbitrary cyclic operads .",
    "we believe that they may find other applications besides the ones we discuss in the second part of the paper ( sections 5  7 ) .",
