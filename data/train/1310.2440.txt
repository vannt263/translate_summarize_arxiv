    "a classical austenite - martensite interface is a plane - the habit plane - separating undistorted austenite from a simple laminate of martensite , i.e.  a region where the deformation gradient jumps between two constant matrices , say @xmath0 and @xmath1 , on alternating bands of width @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , where @xmath4 .",
    "these interfaces have been broadly studied and are well understood . on the other hand , the nonlinear elasticity model for martensitic transformations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) allows for interfaces separating undistorted austenite from more complicated microstructures of martensite ; such interfaces are broadly referred to as non - classical .",
    "seiner and landa @xcite , observed such non - classical interfaces in a cualni shape - memory alloy , in which the martensite consists of two laminates - a compound and a type - ii twin - crossing each other ; this morphology is usually referred to as parallelogram or twin - crossing microstructure .",
    "more strikingly , the volume fraction , say @xmath5 , of the compound twin varied as a function of position , resulting in a non - planar habit surface .    in @xcite ,",
    "an analysis was provided for the macroscopically homogeneous case , i.e.  when the volume fractions of the two crossing laminates remain constant .",
    "it was shown that the observed non - classical austenite - martensite interface is compatible in the sense that , under restrictions on the lattice parameters , given any compound volume fraction @xmath6 , there exist precisely two type - ii volume fractions @xmath2 ensuring continuity of the overall deformation across a planar interface ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : volfracs ] .",
    "equivalently , the continuity of the overall deformation across the planar interface can be expressed in terms of hadamard s jump condition , i.e.  that there exist vectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 and a rotation @xmath9 - all being functions of the volume fractions @xmath2 , @xmath5 - such that @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the macroscopic deformation gradient corresponding to the parallelogram microstructure with volume fractions @xmath2 , @xmath5 . in particular , @xmath12 is the normal to the habit plane and varying the volume fraction @xmath5 ( as in the experimental observations ) forces the habit plane normal to vary accordingly , giving some insight into the inhomogeneous case ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : normals ] .",
    "however , explicit attempts to treat the inhomogeneous microstructure analytically proved to be either intractable , due to the algebraic complexity of the cubic - to - orthorhombic transition of cualni , or in some cases seemingly impossible .     in the compatibility equation ( [ eq : compatibility ] ) for @xmath13 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : volfracs ] . ]    in this paper , a theoretical approach is followed in order to investigate the possibility of non - planar austenite - martensite interfaces .",
    "it is shown that such interfaces are possible within the nonlinear elasticity model for all martensitic transformations with cubic austenite . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , the nonlinear elasticity model is briefly introduced and non - classical interfaces are explained in greater depth .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ lemmamodifiedjump ] provides a modification of hadamard s jump condition allowing for non - planar interfaces and , in lemma  [ lemma : curvedinterface ] , we present a general construction of non - planar interfaces .",
    "this construction is only possible under the assumption that the austenitic well is rank - one connected to the interior of the quasiconvex hull of the martensitic wells relative to a determinant constraint ; see section  [ sec : model ] for the terminology . in corollary",
    "[ corollary : interiorpointcubicaustenite ] we show that this non - trivial assumption is satisfied in particular whenever the austenite is cubic , under appropriate restrictions on the lattice parameters .",
    "in the nonlinear elasticity model microstructures are identified with weak@xmath14 limits of minimizing sequences ( assumed bounded in @xmath15 ) for a total free energy of the form : @xmath16 we note that interfacial energy contributions are ignored , resulting in the prediction of infinitely fine microstructure . above , @xmath17 represents the reference configuration of undistorted austenite at the transformation temperature @xmath18 and @xmath19 denotes the deformed position of the particle @xmath20 .",
    "the free - energy function @xmath21 depends on the deformation gradient @xmath22 and the temperature @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the space of real @xmath25 matrices . by frame indifference , @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , @xmath23 and for all rotations @xmath9",

    "let us restrict attention to planar ones .",
    "then , a non - classical planar austenite - martensite interface @xmath42 at the critical temperature @xmath43 corresponds to a choice of habit - plane normal @xmath8 for which there exists an energy - minimizing sequence of deformations @xmath44 such that , as @xmath45 , @xmath46 i.e.  @xmath47 corresponds to a pure phase of austenite and a general zero - energy microstructure of martensite on either side of the interface @xmath42 . above",

    "the martensitic region , @xmath54 , let us assume for simplicity that the martensitic microstructure is homogeneous ; that is , for @xmath54 , the macroscopic deformation gradient @xmath55 , i.e.  the weak@xmath14 limit in @xmath56 of @xmath48 satisfying ( [ convinmeasure2 ] ) , is independent of @xmath57 .",
    "we note that such matrices @xmath27 are precisely the elements of the _ quasiconvex hull _ of the set @xmath58 , denoted by @xmath59 .",
    "( in general , for a compact set @xmath60 , say , its quasiconvex hull @xmath61 is given by the set of matrices @xmath27 such that there exists a sequence of deformations @xmath62 uniformly bounded in @xmath15 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 in measure of matrices can be equivalently defined in various ways ( see e.g.  @xcite ) but the above definition will suffice for our purposes . ] . )    to make the overall deformation continuous across the planar interface one needs to satisfy the hadamard jump condition as in ( [ eq : compatibility ] ) .",
    "thus , for planar interfaces between austenite and a homogeneous microstructure of martensite , accounting for non - classical interfaces becomes equivalent to establishing rank - one connections between the austenite and the set @xmath59 , i.e.  finding vectors @xmath65 such that @xmath66 where , by frame indifference , we have chosen the identity matrix @xmath67 to represent the austenite energy well . however , in this context , the only known characterization of a quasiconvex hull is for two martensitic wells , that is when @xmath68 , in which case any @xmath69 can be obtained as the macroscopic deformation gradient of a double laminate ( see @xcite ) . using this characterization ball & carstensen",
    "were able to analyze planar non - classical interfaces for cubic - to - tetragonal transformations and the reader is referred to @xcite for details .    in the present paper , we wish to work in a more general setting where we allow the martensitic microstructure to depend on the position vector and the interface to be represented by a general ( @xmath70 ) surface @xmath71 . in this case ,",
    "one still needs to require that ( [ convinmeasure1 ] ) and ( [ convinmeasure2 ] ) hold on either side of @xmath71 but , since we allow the macroscopic deformation gradient @xmath72 of the martensitic microstructure to depend on @xmath20 , we require that @xmath73 a.e .  in the martensitic region .",
    "however , the compatibility condition across the interface @xmath71 no longer suffices and needs to be generalized .",
    "an appropriate generalization is provided in the subsequent section along with statements and proofs of our results .",
    "the first step to constructing a non - planar interface between austenite and an inhomogeneous microstructure of martensite is an appropriate generalization of hadamard s jump condition ; this is theorem  [ lemmamodifiedjump ] . however , before stating and proving the generalized jump condition , let us first clarify notation and terminology , as well as prove an auxiliary lemma ( lemma  [ piecewisepath ] ) used in the proof of theorem  [ lemmamodifiedjump ]",
