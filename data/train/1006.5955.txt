    "the existence of astrophysical non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) has been established by its gravitational effects on a wide range of spatial scales .",
    "perhaps the most compelling evidence for the existence of weakly interacting particle dark matter comes from observations of colliding galaxy clusters in which the baryonic matter in the form of x - ray emitting gas is separated from the source of the gravitational potential detected through gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "however , despite the well - established presence of dm in the universe , its particle nature is unknown .    the quest to understand the nature of dm draws upon research in cosmology , particle physics , and astroparticle physics with direct and indirect detection experiments @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the indirect search for very high energy ( vhe , energy @xmath6 100 gev ) gamma rays resulting from the interaction or decay of dm particles in astrophysical objects in which the gravitational potential is dominated by dm .    among many theoretical candidates for the dm particle @xcite ,",
    "a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is among the best motivated .",
    "a thermal relic of the early universe with an interaction cross section on the weak scale will naturally produce the present - day dm density if the particle has a weak - scale mass @xcite(@xmath7 ( wmap only ) , @xmath8 ( wmap + baryon acoustic oscillations + type ia supernovae ) , where @xmath9 is the ratio of dark matter density to the critical density for a flat universe and @xmath10 is a dimensionless quantity defined as the hubble constant , @xmath11 , normalized to @xmath12 @xcite ) .",
    "several candidates for wimps are predicted in extensions to the standard model of particle physics , for example , the neutralino from supersymmetry @xcite and the kaluza - klein particle in theories of universal extra dimensions @xcite . both neutralinos and kaluza - klein particles",
    "are predicted to have a mass in the range of a few tens of gev / c@xmath13 to possibly a few tev / c@xmath13 .",
    "the self - annihilation of wimps produces a unique spectral signature of secondary gamma rays which is expected to significantly deviate from the standard power - law behavior observed in most conventional astrophysical sources of vhe gamma rays and would have a cutoff at the wimp mass .",
    "in addition , it could exhibit a monoenergetic line at the wimp mass or a considerable enhancement of gamma - ray photons at the endpoint of the spectrum due to the internal bremsstrahlung effect @xcite .",
    "observation of these spectral signatures combined with the spatial distribution of the gamma - ray flux from an astrophysical source is a unique capability of indirect dm searches utilizing gamma rays .",
    "nearby astrophysical objects with the highest dark matter density are natural candidates for indirect dm searches . while the galactic center is likely to be the brightest source of annihilation radiation ( e.g.  see @xcite ) ,",
    "vhe gamma - ray measurements reveal a bright gamma - ray source at the center which constitutes a large astrophysical background @xcite .",
    "other possible bright sources are expected to be the cores of nearby large galaxies such as m31 or halos around galactic intermediate mass black holes , should they exist , where adiabatic compression of dark matter halos could result in a large enhancement in the annihilation signal , in some cases already exceeding experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "however , in these regions , the dm density profiles are poorly constrained and , in the case of nearby galaxies , conventional astrophysical vhe sources can generate backgrounds for dm annihilation searches .",
    "in contrast , the satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) of the milky way are attractive targets for indirect dark matter searches due to their proximity ( 20 - 100 kpc ) and relatively well - constrained dm profiles derived from stellar kinematics .",
    "they , in fact , may be the brightest sources for annihilation radiation after the galactic center @xcite . the general lack of active or even recent star formation in most dsphs implies that there is little background from conventional astrophysical vhe processes as has been observed in the milky way galactic center @xcite .",
    "the growing class of nearby dsphs discovered by recent all - sky surveys @xcite increases the probability of finding an object for which the halo density is sufficient to yield a detectable gamma - ray signal .    in this paper",
    ", we report on an indirect dm search for gamma rays from four dsphs : draco , ursa minor , botes 1 and willman 1 , carried out using the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) .",
    "after a brief summary of the properties of the observational targets and previous vhe observations in section 2 , we describe the veritas instrument , the data set , and the analysis techniques in section 3 .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the discussion of the results and their interpretation in terms of constraints on the wimp parameter space .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with a discussion of the opportunities for indirect dm detection by future ground - based gamma - ray instrumentation .",

    "for example , the mass of a dm halo is determined by the interaction of a galaxy with its neighbors and is concentrated in the outer regions of the galaxy . unlike the dm halo mass ,",

    "the value of @xmath46 is deviations of the dm distribution from a smooth average profile ( substructures ) .",
    "cdm n - body simulations predict substructures in dm halos @xcite and the effects on the dm self - annihilation have been studied in these simulations . in general any regions of dm overdensity",
    "will enhance the self - annihilation flux ; the cumulative effect of these enhancements is usually referred to as the boost factor .",
    "@xcite find a maximum boost factor of order @xmath119 while a more detailed calculation that accounts for the particle properties of the neutralino during formation of dm halos suggests boost factors of order 10 and below @xcite .",

    "internal bremsstrahlung gamma rays produced in neutralino self - annihilation recently calculated by @xcite can significantly enhance dn / de at the energies comparable to @xmath84 for some mssm models due to the absence of the helicity suppression factor .",

    "in addition , the @xmath97 for self - annihilation at the present cosmological time may be considerably larger than at the time of wimp decoupling due to a velocity - dependent term in the cross - section and the reduction of the kinetic energy of the wimp due to the cosmological expansion of the universe @xcite .",

    "typical current exposures accumulated on dsphs by iacts are of order 20 hours , and ongoing observing programs could feasibly increase the depth of these observations by a factor of 10 ( a sensitivity increase of @xmath483 ) .",
    "improvements in background rejection are anticipated to increase sensitivity by an additional 20 - 50% .",

    "next generation iact arrays now being planned such as the advanced gamma - ray imaging system ( agis ) and the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) will provide an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity and lower the energy threshold by factor of @xmath482 as compared to veritas .",

    "<S> indirect dark matter searches with ground - based gamma - ray observatories provide an alternative for identifying the particle nature of dark matter that is complementary to that of direct search or accelerator production experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of observations of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies draco , ursa minor , botes 1 , and willman 1 conducted by the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies are nearby dark matter dominated objects located at a typical distance of several tens of kiloparsecs for which there are good measurements of the dark matter density profile from stellar velocity measurements . since the conventional astrophysical background of very high energy gamma rays from these objects appears to be negligible , they are good targets to search for the secondary gamma - ray photons produced by interacting or decaying dark matter particles . </S>",
    "<S> no significant gamma - ray flux above 200 gev was detected from these four dwarf galaxies for a typical exposure of @xmath0 hours . </S>",
    "<S> the 95% confidence upper limits on the integral gamma - ray flux are in the range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this limiting flux in the context of pair annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) and derive constraints on the thermally averaged product of the total self - annihilation cross section and the relative velocity of the wimps ( @xmath2 @xmath3 s@xmath4 for @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this limit is obtained under conservative assumptions regarding the dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies and is approximately three orders of magnitude above the generic theoretical prediction for wimps in the minimal supersymmetric standard model framework . </S>",
    "<S> however significant uncertainty exists in the dark matter distribution as well as the neutralino cross sections which under favorable assumptions could further lower this limit . </S>"
