    "although the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is yet to discover supersymmetry ( susy ) , this class of models remains one of the most appealing extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . a very attractive explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses , @xmath8 , and their mixings  @xcite is then to embed a seesaw mechanism in the framework of susy models",
    ". a high scale ( close to the grand unification - gut - scale ) type i seesaw  @xcite can account for @xmath8 and the observed pattern of the mixing angles , for naturally large values of the yukawa couplings , @xmath9 .",
    "such scenarios are also very appealing as they can explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) via leptogenesis  @xcite ( through the cp and lepton number violating decays of the heavy mediators responsible for the smallness of neutrino masses , i.e. , the right - handed neutrinos ) .",
    "furthermore , when realised at such high scales , the new dynamics has only a marginal effect on electroweak ( ew ) precision measurements and observables  @xcite , contrarily to other seesaw realisations as , for instance , in the case of a type ii seesaw  @xcite . by itself , and independently of the scale at which it is realised , the type i seesaw is very hard to probe - directly or indirectly - as the mediators are very difficult to produce at colliders ( in particular when heavier than the tev scale ) and/or their effects at low - energies are extremely small ( typically in association with small couplings ) .",
    "however , when embedded in the framework of susy models - the so - called susy seesaw - the type i seesaw offers the interesting feature that flavour violation in the slepton sector is radiatively induced  @xcite and , at low - energies , the new contributions to a large array of charged lepton flavour violation ( clfv ) observables might provide a unique probe of this mass generation mechanism .",
    "in the framework of a type i susy seesaw , low - energy clfv observables such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 conversion in nuclei , etc .",
    ", have been extensively addressed  @xcite .",
    "moreover , clfv has also been studied in high - energy observables  @xcite , as those that can be probed at the lhc as , for instance , lepton flavour violating neutralino decays and slepton mass splittings .",
    "the impact of a type i seesaw on the susy higgs spectrum has been recently discussed in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , under the assumption of a unique source of lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) , one can rely on the synergy of high- and low - energy observables and devise powerful probes ( using data from neutrino experiments , rare lepton decays , and collider searches ) , which allow to shed light on the fundamental nature of lfv .    at hadron colliders ( such as the tevatron and the lhc )",
    "sleptons are in general only produced in the decay chains of a strongly interacting sparticle , i.e. squarks or gluinos ; if these states are heavy ( as suggested by the negative searches at the lhc ) , then slepton production , even if the latter are comparatively light , is extremely difficult ( occurring only via ew gaugino production , which is typically subdominant ) .",
    "nevertheless , numerous slepton - dedicated studies have been conducted for the lhc , in particular focusing on the case in which sleptons are produced from gaugino decays .",
    "hence , the studies of clfv observables are necessarily associated with specific decay chains that only occur in ( reduced ) regions of the susy parameter space : in general , clfv is studied through dilepton mass distributions ( @xmath13 ) of @xmath14 , via observables such as additional edges in @xmath13 and slepton mass splittings ( see , for example  @xcite )",
    ".    a high - energy lepton collider , such as ilc  @xcite , clic  @xcite or a muon collider  @xcite , will allow to extend and to complement lhc searches .",
    "following a potential discovery of new physics at the lhc , linear colliders offer numerous advantages for precision studies , in particular the possibility of probing the properties of the new states .",
    "linear lepton colliders ( lc ) constitute an excellent laboratory to study the slepton sector ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to hadron colliders , the exact nature of the colliding particles is known in a linear collider - valid for electron and muon colliders - and the polarisation of the beams can be known with high precision .",
    "in fact , the possibility of beam polarisation is instrumental to either suppress or enhance sm contributions , so that the latter can be differentiated from new physics processes .",
    "it has been extensively pointed out that the ability of adjusting the polarisation of each beam independently ( and simultaneously ) opens unique possibilities to test the properties of the produced particles : their quantum numbers and `` chiral '' couplings can thus be directly probed under a minimal set of assumptions  @xcite .    in the case of supersymmetric models ,",
    "a lc will complete the lhc exploration of susy  @xcite , possibly resolving particularly difficult cases where lhc measurements fail to clearly identify susy particles , and determining the properties of the new particles ( for instance , cp properties  @xcite , the majorana nature of neutralinos  @xcite and of other new states  @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "concerning the slepton sector , and despite a possibly heavy squark and gluino sectors , lighter sleptons can be directly produced at a linear collider , operating at a comparatively smaller centre of mass ( c.o.m . )",
    "energy , @xmath15 .",
    "in addition to very precise measurements of slepton parameters , such a clean environment ( with a low hadronic background when compared to the lhc ) further allows dedicated studies of rare processes , as is the case of flavour violation .",
    "susy clfv processes at a linear collider , such as for example @xmath16 and @xmath17 , have been previously addressed in the literature .",
    "early analyses have treated flavour violation in the slepton sector using a sneutrino mixing ( oscillation ) based approach  @xcite , while recent studies considered an effective parametrization of the amount of lfv  @xcite , in both cases without focusing on a specific mechanism of flavour violation in the lepton sector .",
    "other studies have specifically considered type i seesaw - inspired models  @xcite .",
    "a linear collider could also offer the possibility of working in the so called @xmath18 or @xmath19 modes - thus becoming a very high energy photon collider , with the option of polarised photon beams  @xcite .",
    "clfv has also been considered in @xmath20 collisions using a phenomenological effective approach  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", not only neutrino parameters have been better constrained  @xcite , but crucial data has just been obtained by several collaborations , with very precise measurements of the chooz angle  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , negative lhc susy searches have also suggested that the susy spectrum might be far heavier than what had previously been considered  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the sensitivity of the experiments dedicated to the observation of low - energy clfv transitions has also significantly improved  @xcite , especially in what concerns @xmath21 decays  @xcite and @xmath22 conversion in nuclei  @xcite .",
    "parallel to these achievements , recent technological developments potentially suggest that the future linear collider will be an ambitious project concerning the expected detector efficiency , as well as electron and positron beam polarisations .",
    "it is also expected that such a collider will run at ( very ) large centre of mass energies , leading to a very high luminosity - see e.g.  @xcite . in view of all the above , in this study",
    "we revisit the potential manifestations of clfv in a future lc assuming a type i susy seesaw as a unique source of lfv , discussing how the possible direct signals and their synergy with other strongly correlated clfv observables can contribute to probe the mechanism of neutrino mass generation .    in this work we study clfv in association to slepton and gaugino pair production in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions .",
    "in view of the ( recent ) stringent experimental bounds on flavour violation in the @xmath22 sector , we only consider final states involving muons and/or electrons , further allowing to maximally benefit from the efficiency of the muon detectors .",
    "let us recall that the reconstruction of high - energy electrons and muons is a key feature of a lc - for instance in the case of clic  @xcite , the muon and electron average identification efficiencies are expected to be as high as 99% and 96% , respectively .",
    "however , we do allow for ( intermediate ) tau production , focusing exclusively on its purely leptonic decays , @xmath23 .",
    "we thus consider all processes leading to final states involving two charged leptons ( @xmath24 ) and missing energy . in the presence of flavour violation in the neutrino sector ,",
    "as confirmed by neutrino data , potential lfv backgrounds arise from charged lepton currents : even in the absence of a seesaw mechanism , these backgrounds are present both in the sm as well as in its minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) , once neutrino oscillations are accommodated via the leptonic mixing matrix , @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "thus , in addition to the pure susy seesaw signal , both the sm and susy charged current interactions provide important contributions to @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) . while in the `` signal '' @xmath28 is strictly composed of susy neutral particles escaping the detector ( the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , which is the lightest neutralino , @xmath29 ) , in the sm ( mssm ) @xmath28 is in the form of neutrinos ( neutrinos + neutralinos ) .",
    "in addition to different flavour final states , we also discuss the unique potential of the @xmath30 channel , since in this case the background is considerably suppressed - in this case the sm contributions to the background are essentially non - existent . in view of such a clean signal",
    ", this process deserves a careful analysis since , in addition to directly probing the majorana nature of the fermionic neutral superparticles , it also allows to relate the neutrino mass generation mechanism to a clfv high - energy observable .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to emphasise the potential of a future linear collider in disentangling a susy seesaw induced lepton flavour violation from the potential sm and susy backgrounds .",
    "we assume centre of mass energies between 500 gev and 3 tev and integrated luminosities of 0.5 and 3 ab@xmath31 , and we explore the possibility of electron and positron beam polarisation , comparing the significance of the signal for different beam configurations .",
    "although a full detector simulation as well as a thorough study of relevant kinematical cuts lies beyond the scope of this study , we nevertheless suggest several possibilities for kinematical cuts .    instead of scanning over the parameter space of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) inspired constrained susy models we illustrate our study via four representative benchmark points , both in the low and high @xmath32 regime )  @xcite",
    "in addition to complying with current lhc bounds , the chosen benchmark points exhibit a viable dark matter relic density  @xcite .",
    "our analysis reveals that , despite the sm and susy backgrounds , the expected number of signal events should allow to probe clfv in extensive regions of the susy seesaw parameter space .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : susyseesaw ] , we briefly review lepton flavour violation in the type i susy seesaw ; sections  [ sec : lfv : lc : epem ] and  [ sec : lfv : lc : emem ] are respectively devoted to the discussion of a charged lepton flavour violation signal ( and corresponding background ) at a linear collider for the @xmath33 and @xmath4 beam options . in section  [ sec",
    ": res ] , we collect the relevant numerical results and discuss the potential observation of a susy seesaw clfv signature at a linear collider , considering different beam configurations / polarisations , always stressing the correlation with the corresponding relevant low - energy observables .",
    "our final remarks are given in section  [ sec : concs ] .",
    "technical details concerning the computation are summarised in the appendix .",
    "irrespective of the dirac / majorana nature of the neutrinos , and of the underlying mechanism of @xmath34-mass generation , charged lepton currents ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) do violate lepton flavour , with a strength given by the relevant entry of the @xmath25 leptonic mixing matrix , @xmath36 . under the standard parametrization ( and omitting majorana cp violating phases for simplicity ) , the @xmath25 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the leptonic mixing angles and @xmath41 the dirac cp phase .",
    "depending on the hypothesised mechanism of neutrino mass generation , and on the specific framework onto which it is embedded , additional sources of charged lepton flavour violation might emerge , leading to potentially important contributions to a number of clfv observables .",
    "here we consider a type i seesaw embedded into the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , which is thus extended by three right - handed neutrino superfields .",
    "the model is defined by its superpotential and soft - susy breaking lagrangian , whose leptonic parts we detail here : @xmath42 where , and without any loss of generality , we work in a basis where both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are diagonal , @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "the relevant slepton soft - breaking terms are then @xmath47 further assuming a flavour blind mechanism of susy breaking ( for instance minimal supergravity inspired ) , the soft breaking parameters obey universality conditions at some high - energy scale , which we choose to be the gauge coupling unification scale @xmath48 gev : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the universal scalar soft - breaking mass and trilinear couplings of the cmssm , and @xmath52 denote lepton flavour indices ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , and assuming the seesaw limit ( i.e. @xmath54 ) , one recovers the usual seesaw equation for the light neutrino mass matrix , @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( @xmath57 being the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the neutral higgs scalars , @xmath58 , with @xmath59 gev ) , and where @xmath60 corresponds to the masses of the heavy right - handed neutrino eigenstates .",
    "the light neutrino matrix @xmath8 is diagonalized by the @xmath25 as @xmath61 .",
    "a convenient means of parametrizing the neutrino yukawa couplings , while at the same time allowing to accommodate the experimental data , is given by the casas - ibarra parametrization  @xcite , which reads at the seesaw scale , @xmath44 , @xmath62 in the above , @xmath63 is a complex orthogonal @xmath64 matrix that encodes the possible mixings involving the right - handed neutrinos , and which can be parameterized in terms of three complex angles @xmath65 @xmath66 .",
    "the non - trivial flavour structure of @xmath9 at the gut scale will induce ( through the running from @xmath67 down to the seesaw scale ) flavour mixing in the otherwise approximately flavour conserving soft - susy breaking terms . in particular , there will be radiatively induced flavour mixing in the slepton mass matrices , manifest in the @xmath68 and @xmath69 blocks of the @xmath70 slepton mass matrix ; an analytical estimation using the leading order ( llog ) approximation leads to the following corrections to the slepton mass terms : @xmath71 the amount of flavour violation is encoded in the matrix elements @xmath72 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfv : llog ] ) , which can be related to high- and low - energy neutrino parameters using eq .",
    "( [ eq : seesaw : casas ] ) .",
    "these renormalisation group equation ( rge ) induced flavour violating corrections have an impact regarding both flavour non - universality and flavour violation in the charged slepton sector , leading to high- and low - energy clfv observables that can be experimentally probed .    at low - energies , there will be important contributions to radiative and three - body lepton decays , as well as to @xmath22 conversion in nuclei ( a detailed discussion , and the corresponding expressions can be found , for example , in  @xcite ) . in particular , and considering a seesaw scale close to the gut scale ( i.e. @xmath73 ) , so that @xmath9 is large ( @xmath74 ) , one expects values of br(@xmath75 ) , br(@xmath76 ) and cr(@xmath22 , n ) to be well within the reach of current dedicated experiments .    at the lhc",
    ", clfv can also be studied , for instance in relation with the @xmath77 decay chains . in scenarios where the @xmath78 is sufficiently heavy to decay via a real ( on - shell ) slepton",
    ", several clfv observables can be manifest : ( i ) sizable widths for clfv decay processes like @xmath79  @xcite ; ( ii ) multiple edges in di - lepton invariant mass distributions @xmath80 , arising from the exchange of a different flavour slepton @xmath81 ( in addition to the left- and right - handed sleptons , @xmath82 ) ; ( iii ) flavoured slepton mass splittings .",
    "as discussed , for instance in  @xcite , the interplay of low- and high - energy observables might provide valuable insight into the underlying mechanism of neutrino mass generation .",
    "in this work we focus our attention on possible signals of clfv in processes of the type @xmath83 + missing energy .",
    "it is important to emphasise here that one must distinguish lfv as originating from charged current interactions , and whose source is strictly related to the @xmath25 matrix ( in a model - independent way ) , from lfv originating from neutral currents involving sleptons .",
    "the latter , although also associated to the @xmath25 , can be related to the implementation of a specific mechanism for clfv : in  @xcite , effective flavour violation entries in the slepton mass matrices were considered ; in  @xcite , lepton flavour violation has been addressed for a linear collider in the framework of a type i susy seesaw . here , and",
    "following the latter approach , we revisit clfv arising from a type i susy seesaw at a linear collider in the light of recent neutrino data , low - energy clfv bounds and , more importantly , for a comparatively heavy susy spectrum as suggested by recent lhc searches .    in our work",
    ", we will thus study signals of susy seesaw clfv as @xmath84 further focusing on final states of the type @xmath85 , so to explore the maximal efficiency of the muon detector  @xcite .",
    "we recall that we do allow for ( intermediate ) tau production , but consider only its purely leptonic decays , @xmath86 . clearly , under the assumption of leptonic",
    "mixing , as parametrized by the @xmath25 , both the sm and the mssm provide important , if not dominant , contributions . in particular , one expects missing energy signatures such as neutrinos pairs ( in the case of the sm ) and/or pairs of neutrinos + 2 neutralinos in the case of the mssm .    before proceeding ,",
    "let us mention that lfv can also be manifest in more involved sparticle production and decays : depending on the specific susy spectrum , other processes might be present , leading to more complex final states ( e.g. , with four charged leptons , mesons , and missing energy ) .",
    "in this study we focus on the following processes @xmath87 as well as the charge - conjugated final states .",
    "the process ( a ) , which corresponds to the signal , will arise from both @xmath88- and @xmath89-channel processes . in the former case",
    ", one can have photon- , @xmath90 , and higgs mediated production of slepton pairs ( whose flavour content is decorrelated from the initial state electrons ) and mixed neutralino ( @xmath91 ) pair production . in the latter case ,",
    "the @xmath89-channel exchange of neutralinos gives rise to slepton production .",
    "although in most cases the event is expected to have a symmetric topology , it is important to notice that , if allowed by the susy spectrum , one might be led to asymmetric cases . some illustrative examples of diagrams leading to final state of type ( a ) can be found in figure  [ fig : diaga ] .

    "following recent developments in lepton physics and the new physics searches at the lhc , we have revisited the potential of a linear collider concerning the study of lepton flavour violation : in particular , we investigated clfv in @xmath33 and @xmath4 collisions in the framework of a type i susy seesaw . due to the leptonic mixing associated with charged current interactions ( @xmath25 ) , clfv will always occur in any model that can accommodate neutrino oscillations , independently from any mechanism of mass generation or new physics model .    if it is to explain neutrino masses and mixings with natural values for the yukawa couplings , the type i seesaw is impossible to probe directly ( at high scale ) ; however , and when embedded into supersymmetric theories , it might radiatively induce several clfv phenomena , which can be manifest in both low - energy observables and in a number of processes at high - energy colliders .    in this work , and following early analyses  @xcite , we have considered @xmath92 and discussed how the signatures of a type i susy seesaw can be disentangled from the sm and/or the mssm , when the latter are effectively enlarged to accommodate low - energy neutrino data ( i.e. @xmath93 ) . to fully explore the lc beam potentialities and maximise the existent synergie with very sensitive low - energy observables such as @xmath94 decay and @xmath12 conversion in nuclei , we selected as `` signal '' the processes @xmath95 .",

    "furthermore the @xmath2 beam option provides one of the cleanest experimental setups to probe not only lepton number violation but also lepton flavour violation . even without beam polarisation ,",
    "@xmath2 collisions offer excellent prospects for disentangling the specific clfv effects of a type - i susy seesaw , in particular for susy spectra along the so - called co - annihilation region .",
