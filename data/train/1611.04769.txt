    "explicit analytic expressions that are valid in certain regimes are e.g.  given in refs .",
    "the crucial point in the context of the present discussion is that the bau in the freeze - in scenario is usually generated at temperatures @xmath56 , when the violation of the total lepton number @xmath57 by the majorana masses @xmath51 is suppressed , and the bau in good approximation originates from a purely flavoured source . since the couplings of the right handed neutrinos to individual sm flavours @xmath58 are determined by the phases in @xmath44 , cf .",

    ". however , consistency checks for both , the hypothesis that the @xmath72 generate the light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and the bau via leptogenesis , are still possible for arbitrarily small @xmath77 .",

    "the requirement to reproduce the observed @xmath3 ( in addition to the observed neutrino masses ) further restricts the range of allowed @xmath94 for given @xmath61 .",
    "this is only partly related to the role of @xmath94 as sources of @xmath8 violation , but predominantly owed to the fact that these phases fix the ratios @xmath62 : for values of @xmath61 that are large enough to be experimentally accessible , the washout of lepton asymmetries in the early universe tends to erase the bau before sphaleron freezeout unless there is a hierarchy amongst the @xmath99 that leads to a flavour asymmetric washout and allows the asymmetry in one flavour to survive .",

    "a measurement of a nonzero @xmath0 would not only be a clear proof that @xmath8 violation exists in the lepton sector , which is a key requirement for leptogenesis , but also allow to make predictions about the heavy neutrino flavour mixing pattern @xmath62 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : regions_no.pdf ] .",
    "if heavy neutrinos are found in collider or fixed target experiments , then the consistency of the observed value of @xmath0 with the indirect constraints extracted from the active - sterile mixings @xmath99 provides a very strong test of the hypothesis that these particles give masses to the light neutrinos . if @xmath84 is large enough to be resolved kinematically and all @xmath73 can be measured individually , then an independent measurement of @xmath0 allows to uniquely fix all model parameters and reconstruct the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) .",
    "this would allow to predict the rate of neutrinoless double @xmath105 decay , the outcome of future searches for violation of lepton number or lepton universality and the amount of unitarity violation in @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , it would also allow to predict the value of @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the hypotheses that the @xmath72 are the origin of neutrino masses and matter in the universe are both fully testable .",
    "@xcite , it has been pointed out that the @xmath8 violation in @xmath72-mediated decays of charged pseudoscalar mesons @xmath106 into lighter mesons @xmath107 and leptons could be measured , which would give direct access to the @xmath8 violation in @xmath72 decays ( assuming that the initial `` production asymmetry '' between positively and negatively charged @xmath106 is under control ) .",
