    "therefore , according to fig .  [ rate ] it is quite plausible that intermittent active motion indeed enhances signalling speed in vivo .",

    "shuttling of large cargo therefore almost universally profits from active motion , whereas active motion of smaller proteins will only be more efficient over sufficiently large distances .",

    "whenever @xmath133 active motion leads to more precise signalling . note that @xmath134 and @xmath135 in order to assure equilibrium sensing conditions . ]",
    "we find that the minimal value of @xmath136 that is required for improved sensing precision with respect to bare diffusion ( i.e. for @xmath133 , which corresponds to the region to the left of the yellow curve in fig .",
    "[ precision ] ) decreases with decreasing @xmath128 .",
    "in other words , for large particles with a smaller @xmath7 the active displacements can become arbitrarily short . given that the typical measurement times lie between @xmath137 sec and @xmath137 min @xcite the conditions for improved signalling accuracy appear to be robustly satisfied .",
    "to understand this we need to recall that , while larger @xmath136 monotonically leads to lower absolute read - out errors ( see eq .",
    "( [ uncc_a ] ) ) , it simultaneously decreases @xmath138 and hence renormalises @xmath139 .",
    "the improved accuracy in fig .  [ precision ] is thus a result of a trade - off between a decreases of the absolute concentration fluctuations and a lower equilibrium probability to be at the receptor site .",
    "this result is striking as it suggests that even the slightest active displacements can disrupt the recurrence and improve the read - out precision as long as their length is larger than the receptor size .    physically , this observation is due to the fact that the receptor collects new information only from statistically independent binding events .",
    "correlations between consecutive measurements arise due to a finite markov binding time @xmath36 and due to the return and rebinding of a previously bound molecule . moreover , we assume that only freely diffusing molecules can bind to the receptor",
    ". therefore , the receptor necessarily experiences the binding of those molecules , which are ballistically swept towards the binding site over a distance larger than the receptor size , as statistically independent . in turn ,",
    "molecules which are ballistically flushed away from the receptor after unbinding will also contribute statistically independent binding events , regardless of how they return to the receptor .",
    "the non - existence of a lower - bound on @xmath136 is thus an artefact of assuming a point - like receptor .",
    "note that in an alternative setting , in which we compare the precision to determe the same concentration of passively moving molecules , which corresponds to a higher @xmath121 in the intermittent active case ( i.e. @xmath140 @xcite ) , the signalling precision would be improved unconditionally .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the 3-dimensional case , where active motion only improves sensing precision for certain values of parameters @xcite , active transport can robustly and much more efficiently improve sensing accuracy in 1-dimensional systems for sufficiently long measurement times .",
    "the degree of recurrence of spatial exploration is essential for random target search processes @xcite . for example , in the facilitated diffusion model of gene regulation the topological coupling of 1- and 3-dimensional diffusion allows for a more efficient search ( e.g. @xcite ) . in a similar manner",
    "intermittent active excursions can significantly speed up random search @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the topological coupling of 1- and 3-dimensional diffusion does not appreciably improve the signalling precision @xcite .",
    "in addition , we showed previously that in a 3-dimensional setting active motion only conditionally improves the signalling accuracy , by decreasing the correlation time of the counting noise in a process called active focusing @xcite .",
    "here we find , strikingly , that active excursions effect qualitative changes in the power spectrum of concentration fluctuations experienced by the receptor in 1-dimensional systems such as neurons . by adding the active component the power spectrum changes from @xmath141 for thermal diffusion alone to a lorentzian shape with a finite plateau .",
    "this lorentzian shape is also observed for passive signalling in 3-dimensions @xcite .",
    "therefore , active excursions disrupt the recurrent nature of 1-dimensional diffusion .",
    "existing studies provide insight into how receptor clustering @xcite and cooperativity @xcite , dimensionality @xcite , spatial confinement @xcite , receptor diffusion @xcite and active transport @xcite affect the precision of receptor signalling .",
    "the overall dependence of the counting noise on the manner the signalling molecules explore their surrounding space suggests that a heterogeneous diffusivity profile @xcite and spatial disorder @xcite would alter the signalling precision as well . both have been observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , signalling molecules or transport versicles often exhibit anomalous diffusion @xcite , both in the form of passive @xcite and active @xcite motion",
    ". it would therefore be interesting to investigate the impact of these features on the sensing precision in the future .",
