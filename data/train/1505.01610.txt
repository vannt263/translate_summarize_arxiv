    "there are three types of anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg interactions , a nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath15 and a next - nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath16 in the leg direction , and a nearest - neighbor coupling on a rung bond @xmath17 . in the limit of weak rung coupling ,",
    "@xmath18 , this model describes decoupled two frustrated spin chains , while a non - frustrated spin ladder is obtained in the limit of weak frustration , @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , this model bridges between a frustrated spin chain and a non - frustrated spin ladder through @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "the preceding studies on this model have shown that there are two different phases as the ground state , i.e. , the columnar - dimer and rung - singlet phases  @xcite . in the columnar - dimer phase ,",
    "the ground state is composed of two degenerated states with spontaneously - broken translational symmetry  @xcite , while no degeneracy exists in the ground state of the rung - singlet phase . in the former case ,",
    "spinon as a fermionic quasi - particle helps us to understand the magnetic behavior , although the hard - core bosonic particle , triplon , gives a better explanation in the latter one .",
    "we note that this is one example of reconstruction of quasi - particles caused by the second - order phase transition with spontaneously - broken symmetry .",
    "we calculate the magnetization curves in both the weak- and strong - rung - coupling limits by using the dmrg method with an open boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "first , we calculate the minimum energies @xmath20 with fixed magnetizations @xmath21 without a magnetic field . then , the energy difference between @xmath20 and @xmath22 determines a magnitude of a magnetic field , @xmath23 at which the magnetization of the ground state changes from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",

    "these are caused by spontaneously - broken symmetries of the plateau states in the present system .",
    "since such a plateau state requires a confirmation with other methods like the numerical calculation and a bosonization approach one by one , these could be non - trivial , although potential plateaux and a possible case of spontaneously - broken symmetries have been discussed in several quantum spin models with similar characteristics  @xcite .",
    "the frustration dependence of the magnetization curve with the strong rung coupling @xmath43 is also calculated with @xmath44 , 0.4 , and 0.7 in figs .",

    "therefore , the transformation makes us possible to consider another su(2 ) quasi - spin model of two different energy scale discussed below .",
    "the original hamiltonian with no perturbations ( @xmath55 ) is rewritten as , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is number operators of the quasi - spins .",
    "the effective chemical potentials for the quasi - spins are given by @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "since the number operator @xmath62 is zero or one , the chemical potential @xmath63 is much greater than @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the energy scales of quasi - spins split off by a strong magnetic field , where the low - energy physics is described by the quasi - spin of ` p ' .",
    "since the magnetization process is obtained by the expectation value @xmath65 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath66 , we can focus the discussion on the low - energy physics described by the quasi - spin of ` p ' . to neglect the high - energy physics , we consider the effective hamiltonian in a hilbert space projected by @xmath67 with @xmath68 . here",

    "see the appendix for more details , by which one can find possible extensions of the theory .",
    "this model has several differences from the original spin model in the weak rung coupling limit ( see table [ tab : comp ] ) .",
    "one is anisotropy of the anti - ferromagnetic spin interactions , where every quasi - exchange interaction is xy - like , @xmath75 .",
    "in addition , we should be careful on the meaning of the magnetization of up and down quasi - spins , because the transformation maps the singlet state to _ down _ and the triplet to _ up _ quasi - spins .",
    "thus , the total magnetization with @xmath76-filling of up spins is not @xmath77 but @xmath76 .",
    "it must be also noted that the quasi - spins couple to the quasi - magnetic field given by , @xmath78 .",
    "this causes the zero expectation value of number of up spins without the real magnetic field @xmath79 , that is , the singlet states pack in rung bonds in the ground state .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with the help of the quasi - spin model , we can approach the natures of the magnetization process in the strong rung - coupling limit .",
    "firstly , the magnetization @xmath80 with the strong rung coupling corresponds to @xmath81 in the weak rung - coupling limit .",
    "the gapped ground state in the weak rung - coupling limit is understood by the majumdar - gosh state with spontaneously - broken translational symmetry , where the spin singlet dimers pack over the legs .",
    "in the same manner , the quasi - spin singlet dimers pack over the legs , although the magnetic moment @xmath82 is set on a singlet dimer in fig .",
    "[ fig : plateaux](b ) .",
    "the 1/3 magnetization plateau with the weak rung coupling is equivalent to @xmath83 plateau in the strong rung - coupling limit .",
    "the freezing - spin structure and long - ranged order are also found in the strong rung - coupling limit , where the real spins of the upper and lower chains coherently freeze . additionally , we can find a @xmath84 plateau and some cusps in the strong rung - coupling limit , which correspond to the @xmath85 plateau and cusp singularities with low magnetic fields in the weak rung - coupling limit , respectively .",
    "therefore , the plateaux in the strong rung coupling correspond to @xmath86 and @xmath87 plateaux of the frustrated spin chain , although physical roles are played by the quasi - spins ( see fig .  [ fig : plateaux](b ) ) . actually , we confirm that the spins freeze coherently between the upper and lower chains in the @xmath88- and @xmath89-plateau states , and that quasi - spin correlation rapidly decays in the @xmath90-plateau state .",
    "moreover , we can see good correspondence between fig .",
    "[ fig : mh](a ) with the weak rung - coupling and the quarter area at the upper right in fig .",
    "[ fig : mh](c ) with the strong rung - coupling including a cusp singularity . since the filling of the quasi - up - spins with the strong rung coupling corresponds to that in the ground state without a magnetic field in the weak rung coupling limit , the magnetization curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : mh](a ) is folded in half in fig .",
    "[ fig : mh](c ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the reconstruction of the quasi - particles results in the emergence of the isostructural magnetization curves in two different limits .",
    "in summary , we have studied the magnetization curve of the frustrated spin - ladder system using the dmrg method , and the three magnetization plateaux are found at @xmath32 , @xmath90 , and @xmath89 due to frustration . in the limit of strong - rung coupling , the magnetization near the field - induced phase transition ( @xmath47 ) can be understood by the triplons on rungs as hard - core bosons . on the other hand ,",
    "the plateaux in @xmath91 can be explained by the quasi - spinons , which are reconstructed from the singlet and the triplet of spin pairs on a rung .",
    "the plateau at @xmath35 corresponds to the valence bond solid of the quasi - spinons , while the plateaux at @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be associated with the array of quasi - spinons such as soliton lattice .",
    "this is different from the usual bec picture of triplons .",
    "the magnetization curves around @xmath88 and @xmath89 look like to be folded in half with same characteristics .",
    "this is also naturally explained using the effective model of quasi - spinons with spontaneously - broken symmetry",
    ".    our results will be useful for frustrated quantum spin ladder systems such as bcpo .",
    "concerning bcpo , it is noted that an anisotropic interaction , i.e. , dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction , is reported by the inelastic neutron scattering study  @xcite .",
    "the dm interaction also change the usual bec picture of triplons on the magnetization process in the spin ladder system  @xcite .",
    "the transition will be modified such as the second order one due to the dm interactions , which lead to linear terms of triplons . when the dm interaction is smaller than the rung coupling , our picture of the quasi - spinons on the magnetization curve will not be changed .",
    "effects of such an interaction on the magnetic plateaux will be clarified in the near future .",
