    "most of these methods specified the initial conditions of the problem in the gravity description of the problem , and it is not completely clear exactly what these initial conditions correspond to in the gauge theory .",
    "however , we recently showed @xcite one possible way to set up the entire problem directly in the gauge theory , only then translating to the gravity description using the conventional elements of the ads / cft dictionary .",
    "we specifically studied jets that carried r charge , and we measured how far that charge traveled before stopping and thermalizing . though we did find that the furthest charge would travel through the plasma scaled as @xmath0 , we also found that , on average , almost all of our jet s charge stopped and thermalized at a shorter distance that scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the size of the space - time region where our jet was created .",

    "@xcite , who used it in a discussion of the falling endpoint of a classical string .",
    "the difference here will be one of context and application : our analysis of jets @xcite does not involve classical strings , and we will use the falling particles to explain the @xmath2 scale .    in our earlier work @xcite , we created the jet by turning on a small - amplitude source whose space - time dependence had the form @xmath21 of ( i ) a high - energy plane wave @xmath22 times ( ii ) a slowly varying envelope function @xmath23 that localizes the source to within a distance @xmath3 of the origin in both space and time .",
