    "photodetachment of negative ions in the presence of a static electric field has been an active research area in the last decades @xcite .",
    "the most interesting feature in the cross section is the induced oscillations above photodetachment threshold by the static electric field .",
    "the oscillations in the total cross sections can be understood using closed - orbit theory @xcite . in an effort to understand the oscillations in various processes involving two - center system such as the photoionization cross section of diatomic molecule @xcite , the scattering of @xmath0 molecule by fast electron @xcite , a molecule in a strong laser field @xcite , above - threshold ionization @xcite and harmonic generation @xcite , afaq and du extended the one - center h@xmath1 model for photodetachment and developed a two - center model for photodetachment@xcite .",
    "they demonstrated the cross sections in the two - center system show strong oscillation which can be explained using closed - orbit theory .",
    "in particular , a detached electron orbit connecting the two centers is identified to be responsible for the oscillation in the total photodetachment cross sections of the two - center system .    to understand the structural information on linear triatomic negative anions such as becl@xmath2,hcn@xmath1,cs@xmath2 and co@xmath2@xcite , afaq _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite recently studied the photodetachment of a triatomic anion with three centers when the axis of the triatomic ion is perpendicular to the laser polarization direction .",
    "interference patterns for detached - electron on a screen placed at a large distance from the system were demonstrated , but the total cross section was found to be smooth and no oscillation was observed for this configuration .    here we extend the study of the total photodetachment cross section of the above triatomic anion system to the general case with an arbitrary laser polarization direction .",
    "we will derive analytic formulas for the total cross section which depends on photon energy , laser polarization direction and other parameters characterizing the triatomic anion .",
    "it will be shown that the cross section shows strong oscillations when the laser polarization is parallel to the system axis and the oscillation amplitudes gradually decrease to zero as the laser polarization is changed to be perpendicular to the axis .",
    "we also obtained the cross section averaged over the orientations of the system .",
    "we compare the cross section of the triatomic anion with that of the two - center system .",
    "the oscillations in photodetachment cross sections for the triatomic anion appear much enhanced compared to the two - center case .",
    "we find there are two oscillation frequencies in the triatomic anion .",
    "the two oscillations are explained using closed - orbit theory .",
    "atomic units will be used unless specially noted .",
    "the linear triatomic anion interacting with a laser is shown schematically in fig.1 .",
    "symbols 1,0 and 2 represent the three atomic centers in the system .",
    "it is convenient to choose the z - axis in the direction of the three - center axis and the middle center denoted by 0 as the origin of coordinates .",
    "let @xmath3 be the distance between two adjacent centers .",
    "the laser polarization direction is denoted as @xmath4 with respect to the @xmath5 axis .    in the triatomic anion , one active electron",
    "is assumed . this is an extension of the two - center model for photodetachment@xcite to a three - center model by afaq _ _ et al.__@xcite . in the photodetachment process",
    ", there are two steps : in the first step , the active electron absorbs one photon energy @xmath6 and escapes from the negative anion as an electron wave from each center ; in the second step , the outgoing waves from each center propagate out to large distances .",
    "the interference of the outgoing waves from each center produces oscillatory cross section .    for the general case , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , let @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 be the detached - waves from center 1 , 0 and 2 respectively . following the previous approach in the two - center case@xcite",
    ", the outgoing detached - electron wave @xmath10 from the triatomic anion can be written as a linear combination given by@xcite @xmath11 let @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the spherical coordinates of the detached - electron relative to the three centers respectively . the detached - electron wave generated from each center",
    "has been worked previously@xcite .",
    "they can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and e is the detached - electron energy ; @xmath17 is related to the binding energy @xmath18 of h@xmath1 by @xmath19 .",
    "the photon energy is given by @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is a normalization constant@xcite , @xmath22 is the speed of light and is approximately equal to 137a.u .. the angular factor such as @xmath23 represents the dependence of the detached - electron wave function on the outgoing direction @xmath24 for center 0 , and it can be written as @xcite @xmath25 the angular factors @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be written out in a similar way .    after substituting eqs.(2 ) and",
    "eqs.(3 ) in eq.(1 ) , we can get the explicit expression for the detached - electron wave function @xmath10 . the resulting formula for @xmath10",
    "can be simplified because the calculation of the photodetachment cross section requires the knowledge of @xmath10 at large distances where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are much greater than the distance @xmath3 between two neighboring centers .",
    "let @xmath31 be the spherical coordinates of the detached - electron relative to the origin .",
    "then we approximate the phase terms using @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; in other places we can set @xmath35 , @xmath36 . with these approximations , @xmath10 becomes @xmath37      \\frac{\\exp(ikr)}{kr},r\\rightarrow\\infty.\\ ] ] eq.(4 ) describes the detached - electron wave of the linear triatomic anion when the detached - electron is far away from the anion .",
    "the differential cross section is @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the photodetachment cross section , @xmath40 is the differential area on a surface @xmath41 such as the surface of a large sphere enclosing the anion , @xmath42 is the coordinate on the surface @xmath41 , @xmath43 is the exterior norm vector at @xmath42 and @xmath44 is the detached - electron flux .",
    "the detached - electron flux in the radial direction can be evaluated as @xmath45 when eq.(4 ) is substituted in eq.(6 ) , we get @xmath46.\\ ] ]    to get the total photodetachment cross section , we integrate the differential photodetachment cross section using eq.(5 ) and eq.(7 ) over @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 after a straightforward integration , we find the total photodetachment cross section can be written as a product form @xmath50 where @xmath51 in the above equations , @xmath52 is the smooth total photodetachment cross section of h@xmath1@xcite and @xmath53 is a modulation function for the triatomic anion .",
    "the function @xmath54 appearing in eq.(11 ) is given by @xmath55 + 3[\\frac{\\sin s}{s^3}-\\frac{\\cos s}{s^2}].\\ ] ] the function @xmath54 also appears in the modulation function for the two - center problem studied previously@xcite .",
    "first we show the cross section obtained by afaq @xmath56 @xmath57.@xcite for the perpendicular configuration can be obtained from the general formulas . when the laser polarization direction is perpendicular to the direction of the axis , @xmath58 . from eqs.(9)-(12",
    ") we immediately have @xmath59      + 4[\\frac{\\sin(2kd)}{(2kd)^3}-\\frac{\\cos(2kd)}{(2kd)^2}]].\\ ] ] the result in eq.(13 ) is identical to that given by afaq _ _ et al.__@xcite . in fig.2",
    "we compare the photodetachment cross section in eq.(13 ) with the cases @xmath60 and @xmath61 in eqs.(9)-(12 ) when @xmath62 .",
    "indeed we do not find any oscillation in the the cross section for @xmath58 in agreement with afaq _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "but when the direction of laser polarization is not perpendicular to the axis , we observe a hint of oscillation as illustrated in the insert .",
    "in fact , the oscillations will become strong and obvious as the parameter @xmath63 is increased to be comparable or greater than @xmath64 . in fig.3",
    "we show the photodetachment cross sections in eqs.(9)-(12 ) for several @xmath3 and @xmath65 values .",
    "the following points can be derived directly from fig.3 .",
    "first , we do not observe obvious oscillation in the photodetachment cross sections for the perpendicular laser polarization ( @xmath58 ) even when @xmath3 is increased .",
    "but when the laser polarization direction is not perpendicular to the anion axis , there are strong oscillations .",
    "second , the oscillation amplitude depends on the laser polarization direction .",
    "in fact , the oscillation amplitude increases and reaches maximum as the laser polarization direction is turned from perpendicular to parallel direction with respect to the anion axis ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "however , the oscillation frequency is not sensitive to the laser polarization direction .",
    "the modulation function @xmath66 suggests the oscillation frequency increases but the oscillation amplitude decreases as the parameter @xmath3 is increased .",
    "the oscillations are easily observed when @xmath3 is approximately around @xmath67 in our system .    the limits of the photodetachment cross sections of the anion can be obtained from the limits of @xmath54 .",
    "using taylor series expansion , one can show @xmath68 the above results are independent of the value of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore we conclude from eqs.(9)-(12 ) that in the low energy limit the total photodetachment cross section of the three - center system is three times of the photodetachment cross section of a single - center system and in the large photon energy limit the photodetachment cross section of the three - center system approaches the photodetachment cross section of a single - center system .",
    "it is also straightforward to get the photodetachment cross section averaged over the orientations of the anion .",
    "let us assume the direction of the anion is random with respect to the laser polarization direction . defining the averaging by @xmath69 the integrals",
    "can be evaluated to give the following results , @xmath70    it is interesting that the average cross section is equal to the laser polarization dependent cross section in eqs.(9)-(12 ) evaluated at a special angle satisfying @xmath71 ( approximately @xmath72 ) .",
    "the same angle was noticed for the two - center system earlier@xcite .",
    "the averaging process does not change the basic oscillatory structure of the cross section .",
    "however , the oscillation amplitudes in the average cross section are reduced to one third of the values obtained for the laser polarization dependent cross section at @xmath60 . in fig.4(a ) we compare the average cross section and the laser polarization dependent cross section at @xmath60 .",
    "the oscillations are better analyzed using a transformation .",
    "for the cross section @xmath73 we define @xmath74 using the following integral @xmath75      \\sin[\\frac{\\pi(e - e_1)}{(e_2-e_1)}]k\\exp(-ikx)de.\\ ] ]    in fig.4(b ) we present the corresponding transformations of the two cross sections in fig.4(a ) .",
    "several points can be derived from fig.4 regarding the oscillations .",
    "first , there are two peaks in each transformation .",
    "the peaks correspond to two oscillations in each cross section .",
    "second , the oscillation frequencies are not changed by the averaging procedure .",
    "third , the oscillation amplitudes in the average cross section are considerable reduced .    we now compare the average photodetachment cross section of the triatomic anion with that of the two - center negative ion studied earlier@xcite . in fig.5(a )",
    "we show the two cross sections .",
    "one can see that the oscillation in the photodetachment cross section for the triatomic anion is enhanced compared to that for the two - center system . in fig.5(b )",
    "we show the corresponding transformations of the two cross sections in fig.5(a ) .",
    "it is clear from fig.5(b ) that there are two oscillations for the triatomic anion but only one oscillation for the two - center system .",
    "closed - orbit theory was extended previously to explain the oscillation in the cross section of the two - center system .",
    "the oscillation was identified as an interference between the detached - electron wave emitted at one center and the source of the wave at another center@xcite .",
    "a similar explanation can be made here .",
    "for example , the detached - electron wave produced at center 1 will reach center 0 and 2 as it propagates out .",
    "the overlap of this detached - electron wave from center 1 with the source at center 0 and the source at 2 produce the @xmath76 and @xmath77 oscillations in the total cross section .",
    "detached - electron wave from center 2 also have similar interference terms .",
    "the final oscillation amplitudes include all the interference terms .",
    "we will not repeat the detail of such derivation which is quite similar to the two - center case@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that such a derivation based on closed - orbit theory establishes that @xmath78 is the action @xmath79 of the detached - electron propagating from one center to a neighboring center and @xmath80 is the action of the detached - electron propagating from center 1 to center 2 or from center 2 to center 1 .",
    "the two oscillations are directly associated with the detached - electron orbits from one center to a neighboring center having action @xmath78 and the detached - electron orbits connecting center 1 and 2 having action @xmath80 .",
    "we have studied the photodetachment of the recent triatomic anion model@xcite in the general case .",
    "we have derived the total photodetachment cross section for arbitrary laser polarization direction .",
    "it is demonstrated there are two oscillation frequencies in the cross sections .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations can be varied by changing the laser polarization direction .",
    "the amplitudes are largest when the laser polarization is parallel to the anion axis .",
    "as the laser polarization direction is turned to be perpendicular to the axis , the oscillation amplitudes decrease and vanish .",
    "we also obtained the average cross section for random orientations of anion .",
    "the averaging procedure modifies the oscillation amplitudes but it does not change the oscillation frequencies . the two oscillations in the present three - center system can be explained using closed - orbit theory as interference between detached - electron waves produced from one center and the sources at other centers .",
    "two types of detached - electron orbits",
    "are responsible for the two oscillations .                                                            howard d. cohen and u. fano , phys . rev . * 150*,30 ( 1966 ) o. kamalou , _ et , al _ phys .",
