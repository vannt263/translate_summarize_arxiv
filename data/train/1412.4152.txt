    "the eigenvalues of the laplacian operator and its fourth - order cousin the bi - laplacian appear in many models of physical situations , representing quantities such as frequency or energy .",
    "one classic example is that the eigenvalues @xmath8 of the neumann laplacian on a bounded region @xmath9 determine the frequencies of vibration of a free membrane with that shape .",
    "if @xmath10 is the ball of same volume as @xmath9 , then we have @xmath11 first conjectured by kornhauser and stakgold @xcite , this isoperimetric inequality was proved for simply connected domains in @xmath12 by szeg @xcite and extended to all domains and dimensions by weinberger @xcite .",
    "while laplacian eigenvalue problems represent vibrations of membranes , there are corresponding bi - lapalace problems represent vibrations and buckling energies of plates .",
    "fourth - order plate problems are frequently more difficult than their second - order analogs  the theory of the bi - laplace operator is not as well understood , and because the order is higher , exact solutions ( such as those used for trial function methods ) can require more complicated linear combinations of special functions .    the isopermetric inequality for the fundamental tone of the dirichlet laplacian ( drum ) was proved by faber @xcite and krahn @xcite in the 1920 s with the ball as the minimizer .",
    "it was not until the 1980 s and 90s that it was proved that the ball also the lower bound for the first clamped plate eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "the methods used by talenti , nadirashvilli , ashbaugh and benguria to prove the clamped plate isoperimetric inequality are quite different than those for the free plate and membrane and only establish the bound in dimensions 2 and 3 .",
    "the problem remains open for dimensions four and higher , with a partial result by ashbaugh and laugesen @xcite .",
    "for forth - order problems .",
    "other boundary conditions exist , such as the hinged plate investigated by nazarov and sweers @xcite .",
    "other generalizations of the szgo - weinberger inequality include its analog in other spaces . in spaces of constant curvature ,",
    "the spherical cap ( analog of the ball ) maximizes the first neumann eigenvalue , as seen by ashbaugh and benguria@xcite in gauss space , the problem was cconsidered by chiacchio and di blasio @xcite . as in euclidean space",
    "this gives an upper bound on the fundamental tone of the neumann gaussian laplacian ( hermitian ) ; one can also consider lower bounds on the neumann eigenvalues , eg , @xcite .    in @xcite , we adapted weinberger s trial function argument to prove the free plate analog of the szgo - weinberger inequality for plates with positive tension and assuming the poisson s ratio ( a property of the material ) of the plate was zero .",
    "taking @xmath13 to be the fundamental tone , we had that : @xmath14 in this paper we present a generalization of this result to some plates under tension with _ nonzero _ values of poisson s ratio .",
    "we prove that if the dimension , tension , and poisson s ratio are such that fundamental mode of the ball has simple angular dependence , we again have the bound  .",
    "our proof relies on the variational characterization of eigenvalues with suitable trial functions , taken to be extensions of the fundamental mode of the unit ball .",
    "this follows both weinberger s approach for the free membrane and our prior work for the free plate with zero poisson s ratio in @xcite .",
    "however , because the plate equation is fourth order , finding the trial functions and establishing the appropriate monotonicities is significantly more complicated than in the membrane case .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath1 further complicates matters and prevents us from applying some of our tools from @xcite , including identifying the fundamental mode of the ball .",
    "based on numerical evidence and analytic reasoning , we conjecture that the fundamental mode of the ball has simple angular dependence ( ie , in dimension 2 the angular part can be written as @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) for all dimensions , positive tension and mathematically suitable values of poisson s ratio , and so the isoperimetric inequality   holds for all plates .",
    "poisson s ratio , which we will denote by @xmath1 , is a property of the material of the plate .",
    "if a material is stretched in one direction , it usually contracts in the orthogonal directions ; the value @xmath1 is a ratio of the strains . in some materials",
    "the material expands in the orthogonal directions rather than contracting ; these materials have @xmath17 and are called auxetic .    considering",
    "nonzero poisson s ratio is a natural generalization of the free plate problem because @xmath1 appears in the rayleigh quotient for the plate , even though it does not appear in the eigenvalue equation itself ; instead , we see explicit dependence on @xmath1 in the natural boundary conditions .",
    "verchota recently established the solvability of the biharmonic neumann problem @xcite , the boundary conditions for which arise from the zero - tension plate with nonzero poisson s ratio .",
    "interestingly , the clamped plate problem is independent of @xmath1 . although the clamped plate problem begins from the plate rayleigh quotient , integration by parts and the imposed boundary conditions allow the clamped plate quotient to be written in its more familiar form , which is independent of @xmath1",
    "this paper proceeds as follows : we begin by formulating the problem and stating our main theorem , a partial result towards the conjectured isoperimetric inequality .",
    "we then prove existence of the discrete spectrum and regularity of the eigenfunctions for specific values of @xmath1 in section  [ specsec ] and use the rayleigh quotient to establish bounds on the fundamental tone as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath5 in section  [ functausec ] .    to prepare to prove the theorem",
    ", we establish crucial properties of ultraspherical bessel functions in section  [ besselsec ] , derive the form of the natural boundary conditions in section  [ bcsec ] .",

    "a positive @xmath5 represents a plate under tension ; taking @xmath21 gives us a plate under compression . the limiting case",

    "we derive the partial differential equation and boundary conditions governing the vibrational modes of a free plate .",

    "note that @xmath741 is decreasing in @xmath543 , so taking @xmath742 we can make the following lower - bound estimate : @xmath743 which is positive for all @xmath192 . thus @xmath740 and hence @xmath744 are both positive for all @xmath192 and @xmath543 under consideration .",
    "when @xmath37 , we instead have @xmath745 note that @xmath741 is decreasing in @xmath543 , since we have @xmath746 .",
    "so @xmath741 is minimized when we take @xmath702 , giving us @xmath747 the roots of this right - hand side cubic are real and occur at @xmath748 and @xmath749 .",
    "since the coefficient of @xmath750 is negative , this means @xmath751 is nonnegative for @xmath752 as desired .",
    "this completes our proof , as we have shown that @xmath626 is nonnegative for all @xmath5 , @xmath110 , @xmath543 , and @xmath192 under consideration , and hence @xmath606 is nonnegative , which was sufficient to establish positivity of @xmath578 .",
    "now that we have established the desired monotonicity of our quotient , we need two more lemmas before we can prove the isoperimetric inequality for the free plate under tension .",

    "the final lemma describes how the eigenvalues change with the dilation of the region , and is used in the proof of the theorem to show we need only consider @xmath9 with volume equal to that of the unit ball .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath756 for @xmath757 .    [ scaling ] ( scaling ) for all @xmath757 ,",
    "we have @xmath758    the proof is straightforward and nearly identical to that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 15 ) , and so not repeated here .",
    "we can now prove our main result .",
    "once we have established inequality for all regions @xmath9 of volume equal to that of the unit ball and all @xmath0 , we obtain for regions of arbitrary volume , since @xmath759 for all @xmath757 by lemma  [ scaling ] .",
    "thus it suffices to prove the theorem for @xmath9 with volume equal to that of the unit ball , so that @xmath36 is the unit ball .",
    "we may also translate @xmath9 as in lemma  [ trialfcn ] , which leaves the fundamental tone unchanged .",
