    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are intense flashes of @xmath2-rays which are observed approximately once per day and are isotropically distributed over the sky ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the variability of the bursts on time scales as short as a millisecond indicates that the sources are very compact , while the identification of host galaxies and the measurement of redshifts for more than 200 bursts have shown that grbs are of extra - galactic origin .",
    "grbs are grouped into two broad classes by their characteristic duration and spectral hardness @xcite .",
    "long grbs ( @xmath3 2 s , with softer spectra ) , are related to the collapse of massive stars with highly rotating cores ( see e.g. reviews * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the extreme core - collapse scenarios leading to grbs result in the formation of a stellar - mass black hole with an accretion disk or of a highly - magnetized neutron star ; for a review see @xcite and references therein . in both cases",
    "the emission of gravitational waves ( gws ) is expected , though the amount of emission is highly uncertain .",
    "the progenitors of most short grbs ( @xmath4 2 s , with harder spectra ) are widely thought to be mergers of neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole binaries ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though up to a few percent may be due to giant flares from a local distribution of soft - gamma repeaters @xcite .",
    "the mergers , referred to here as compact binary coalescences , are expected to be strong gw radiators @xcite .",
    "the detection of gravitational waves associated with a short grb would provide direct evidence that the progenitor is indeed a compact binary .",
    "with such a detection it would be possible to measure component masses @xcite and spins @xcite , constrain neutron star equations of state @xcite , test general relativity in the strong - field regime @xcite , and measure calibration - free luminosity distances @xcite , which allow the measurement of the hubble expansion and dark energy .",
    "several searches for gravitational waves associated with gamma - ray bursts have been performed using data from ligo and virgo @xcite .",
    "most recently , data from the fifth ligo science run and the first virgo science run were analyzed to search for coalescence signals or unmodeled gravitational - wave bursts associated with 137 grbs from 2005 - 2007 @xcite .",
    "no evidence for a gravitational - wave signal was found in these searches . for grb  051103 and grb  070201 , short - duration grbs with position error boxes overlapping respectively the m81 galaxy at 3.6mpc and the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) at 770kpc , the non - detection of associated gravitational waves ruled out the progenitor object being a compact binary coalescence in m81 or m31 with high confidence @xcite .",
    "although it is expected that most grb progenitors will be at distances too large for the resulting gravitational - wave signals to be detectable by ligo and virgo @xcite , it is possible that a few grbs could be located nearby .",
    "for example , the smallest observed redshift to date of an optical grb afterglow is @xmath5 ( @xmath6 mpc ) for grb  980425 @xcite ; this would be within the ligo - virgo detectable range for some progenitor models .",
    "recent studies @xcite indicate the existence of a local population of under - luminous long grbs with an observed rate density approximately @xmath7 times that of the high - luminosity population . also , observations suggest that short - duration grbs tend to have smaller redshifts than long grbs @xcite , and this has led to fairly optimistic estimates @xcite for detecting associated gravitational - wave emission",
    ". approximately 90% of the grbs in our sample do not have measured redshifts , so it is possible that one or more could be much closer than the typical @xmath8gpc distance of grbs .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of a search for gravitational waves associated with 154  grbs that were detected by satellite - based gamma - ray experiments during the sixth ligo science run and second and third virgo science runs , which collectively spanned the period from 2009 july 7 to 2010 october 20 .",
    "we search for coalescence signals associated with 26 short grbs and unmodeled gw bursts associated with 150  grbs ( both short and long ) .",
    "the search for unmodeled gw bursts targets signals with duration @xmath9 s and frequencies in the most sensitive ligo / virgo band , approximately 60 hz @xmath10 500 hz .",
    "we find no evidence for a gravitational - wave candidate associated with any of the grbs in this sample , and statistical analyses of the grb sample show no sign of a collective signature of weak gravitational waves .",
    "we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor for each grb , and constrain the fraction of the observed grb population at low redshifts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : signal ] discusses the gw signal models that are used in these searches .",
    "[ sec : s6run ] briefly describes the ligo and virgo gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "[ sec : grbsample ] describes the grb sample during the 2009 - 2010 ligo - virgo science runs , and sec .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] with some comments on the astrophysical significance of these results and the prospects for grb searches in the era of advanced gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "as noted above , the progenitors of long grbs are extreme cases of stellar collapse , while the most plausible progenitors of the majority of short grbs are mergers of a neutron star with either another neutron star or a black hole . in this section",
    "we review the expected gw emission associated with each scenario , and the expected delay between the gamma - ray and gw signals .",
    "stellar collapse is notoriously difficult to model .",
    "it necessitates complex micro - physics and full three - dimensional simulations , which take years to complete for a single initial state .",
    "many simulations that include some , but not all , physical aspects have been performed for non - extreme cases of core - collapse supernovae , which identified numerous potential gw burst emission channels ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "these models predict emission of up to @xmath11 through gws .",
    "given the sensitivity of current gw detectors , such gw emission models are not detectable from extra - galactic progenitors .",
    "however , in the extreme stellar collapse conditions which are necessary to power a grb , more extreme gw emission channels can be considered .",
    "several semi - analytical scenarios have been proposed which produce up to @xmath0 in gws , all of which correspond to some rotational instability developing in the grb central engine @xcite . in each model",
    "the gws are emitted by a quadrupolar mass distribution rotating around the grb jet axis .",
    "given the observation of a grb , this axis is roughly pointing at the observer , which yields circularly polarized gws @xcite .",
    "for extreme stellar collapses , the arrival of @xmath2-rays can be significantly delayed with respect to the gw emission .",
    "delays of up to 100s can be due to several phenomena : the delayed emission of the relativistic jet @xcite ; sub - luminal propagation of the jet to the surface of the star in the collapsar model for long grbs ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and the duration , in the observer s frame , of the relativistic propagation of the jet before the onset of the prompt @xmath2-ray emission @xcite . for some grbs , @xmath2-ray precursors have been observed up to several hundred seconds before the main @xmath2-ray emission peak @xcite ; the precursor could mark the initial event , with the main emission following after a delay .",
    "the coalescence of two compact objects is usually thought of as a three - step process : an inspiral phase , where the orbit of the binary slowly shrinks due to the emission of gws ; a merger phase , when the two objects plunge together ; and a ringdown phase , during which the newly created and excited black hole settles into a stationary state  @xcite . as the gravitational waves emitted in the inspiral phase",
    "dominate the signal - to - noise - ratio in current detectors , we focus on that phase only .",
    "we consider compact binaries consisting of two neutron stars ( ns - ns ) or a neutron star with a black hole ( ns - bh ) . as the objects spiral together , the neutron star(s )",
    "are expected to tidally disrupt shortly before they coalesce , creating a massive torus .",
    "the matter in the torus can then produce highly relativistic jets , which are supposedly ejected along the axis of total angular momentum .",
    "while this picture is supported by recent numerical simulations @xcite , it has not yet been confirmed by complete simulations , and the influence of a tilted bh spin is uncertain .",
    "contrary to the long grb case , the onset of @xmath2-ray emission is delayed only up to a few seconds compared to the gw emission , as there is no dense material retaining the jet and other delay effects are at most as long as the grb duration @xcite .",
    "semi - analytical calculations of the final stages of a ns ",
    "bh coalescence show that the majority of matter plunges onto the bh within @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the mass transfer suggest a timescale of milliseconds or a few seconds at maximum @xcite .",
    "therefore , an observer in the cone of the collimated outflow is expected to observe the gravitational - wave signal up to a few seconds before the electromagnetic signal from the prompt emission .",
    "the ligo and virgo detectors are kilometer - scale , power - recycled michelson interferometers with orthogonal fabry - perot arms @xcite .",
    "they are designed to detect gravitational waves with frequencies ranging from @xmath12hz to several khz , with maximum sensitivity near 150hz .",
    "there are two ligo observatories : one located at hanford , wa and the other at livingston , la .",
    "the hanford site houses two interferometers : one with 4 km arms ( h1 ) and the other with 2 km arms ( h2 ) .",
    "the livingston observatory has one 4 km interferometer ( l1 ) .",
    "the two observatories are separated by a distance of 3000 km , corresponding to a travel time of 10ms for light or gravitational waves .",
    "the virgo detector ( v1 ) is in cascina near pisa , italy .",
    "the time - of - flight separation between the virgo and hanford observatories is 27ms , and between virgo and livingston is 26ms .",
    "a gravitational wave is a spacetime metric perturbation that is manifested as a time - varying quadrupolar strain , with two polarization components .",
    "data from each interferometer records the length difference of the arms and , when calibrated , measures the strain induced by a gravitational wave .",
    "these data are in the form of a time series , digitized at a sample rate of 16384hz ( ligo ) or 20000hz ( virgo ) .",
    "the sixth ligo science run was held from 2009 july 07 to 2010 october 20 . during this run ,",
    "the 4 km h1 and l1 detectors were operated at sensitivities that surpassed that of the previous 2005 - 2007 run , with duty factors of 52% and 47% .",
    "the 2 km h2 detector was not operated in 2009 - 2010 .",
    "the second virgo science run was held from 2009 july 07 to 2010 jan 08 with an improvement in sensitivity roughly a factor of 2 over virgo s first science run .",
    "the third virgo science run was held from 2010 aug 11 to 2010 oct 20 .",
    "the overall virgo duty cycle over these two science runs was 78% .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] shows the best sensitivities , in terms of noise spectral density , of the ligo and virgo interferometers during these runs .",
    "the distance at which the ligo instruments would observe an optimally oriented , optimally located coalescing neutron - star binary system with a signal - to - noise - ratio of 8 reached about 40mpc ; for virgo the same figure of merit reached about 20mpc .",
    "the geo  600 detector @xcite , located near hannover , germany , was also operational in 2009 - 2010 , though with a lower sensitivity than ligo and virgo .",
    "we do not use the geo data in this search as the modest gains in the sensitivity to gravitational - wave signals would not have offset the increased complexity of the analysis .",
    "however , geo data is used in searches for gravitational waves coincident with grbs occurring during periods when only one of the ligo or virgo detectors is operational , such as the period between the fifth and sixth ligo science runs and during summer 2011 .",
    "the result of those searches will be reported in a future publication .",

    "we obtained our sample of grb triggers from the gamma - ray burst coordinates network ( gcn ) @xcite , supplemented by the _ _ swift _ _ and _ _ fermi _ _ trigger pages .",
    "this sample of grb triggers came mostly from the _ swift _ satellite @xcite and the _ fermi _ satellite @xcite , but several triggers also came from other spaceborne experiments , such as maxi @xcite , superagile @xcite and integral @xcite , as well as from time - of - flight triangulation using satellites in the third interplanetary network ( ipn ) @xcite .    in total",
    "there are 404  grbs in our grb sample during the 2009 - 2010 ligo - virgo science runs .",
    "about 10% of the grbs have associated redshift measurements , all of them evidently beyond the reach of current gw detectors .",
    "nevertheless , times around these grbs have been analyzed in case of , for example , a chance association with an incorrect host galaxy .",
    "grbs that occurred when two or more of the ligo and virgo detectors were operating in a resonant and stable configuration are analyzed .",
    "data segments which are flagged as being of poor quality are excluded from the analysis . in total ,",
    "154  grbs were analyzed , out of which 150  grbs were analyzed by the gw burst search , and 26 short grbs were analyzed by the coalescence search .",
    "( as the gw data quality requirements are somewhat different for the unmodeled burst and coalescence searches , 4 short grbs analyzed by the coalescence search could not be analyzed by the gw burst search . )",
    "the classification of grbs into short and long is somewhat ambiguous @xcite .",
    "since binary mergers are particularly strong sources of gravitational radiation , we make use of a more lenient classification to identify grbs which may originate from a binary merger @xcite .",
    "our selection is based on the @xmath13 duration ( the time interval over which 90% of the total background - subtracted photon counts are observed ) , and on visual inspection of all available lightcurves .",
    "specifically , we treat as `` short '' all grbs with @xmath14s ; this choice , rather than the standard 2s cutoff for short grbs , is to ensure we include those short grbs in the tail of the duration distribution .",
    "in addition , some of the longer - duration grbs exhibit a prominent short spike at the beginning of the lightcurve and an extended longer emission @xcite , suggesting that those grbs might be created by the merger of two compact objects .",
    "those grbs were also treated as short grbs and , where necessary , the trigger time used for the coalescence search was shifted by up to a few seconds to match the rising edge of the spike ( which should correspond to the binary coalescence time ) .",
    "this lenient classification ensures a relatively complete sample , at the price of sample purity  some of the grbs we analyze as `` short '' may not have a compact binary progenitor .",
    "this impurity is acceptable for the purpose of gw detection where we do not want to miss a potentially observable gw counterpart .",
    "the final set of 26 short grbs is given in tab .",
    "[ tab : shortgrb ] .",
    "a large number of grbs detected by the ipn are not reported by the gamma - ray burst coordinates network ; the result of a search for gws associated with those grbs will be reported in a future publication .",
    "we perform searches for both unmodeled bursts and coalescence signals .",
    "we begin this section by describing the basic methodology and features common to both searches , then briefly present the details of the two analysis methods .",
    "both search pipelines identify an `` on - source '' time in which to search for an associated gw event .",
    "this time selection is expected to improve by a factor @xmath81.5 the sensitivity of the search compared to an all - sky / all - time search @xcite . for the gw burst search ,",
    "we use the interval from 600s before each grb trigger to either 60 s or the @xmath13 time ( whichever is larger ) after the trigger as the window in which to search for a gw signal .",
    "this conservative window is large enough to take into account most plausible time delays between a gw signal from a progenitor and the onset of the gamma - ray signal , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : signal : longgrb ] .",
    "this window is also safely larger than any uncertainty in the definition of the measured grb trigger time . for cases when less early gw data are available , a shorter window starting 120s before the grb trigger time",
    "this still covers most time - delay scenarios . for the binary coalescence search",
    ", it is believed that the delay between the merger and the emission of @xmath2-rays will be small , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : signal : shortgrb ] .",
    "we therefore use an interval of 5 s prior to the grb to 1 s following as the on - source window , which is wide enough to allow for uncertainties in the emission model and in the arrival time of the electromagnetic signal @xcite .",
    "the on - source data are scanned by the search algorithms to detect possible gw transients ( either coalescence or burst ) , referred to as `` events '' .",
    "for both searches the analysis depends on the sky position of the grb .",
    "grbs reported by the _",
    "swift _ satellite have very small position uncertainty ( @xmath15 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the gw searches need only be performed at the reported sky location . for grbs detected by the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) on the _ fermi _ satellite @xcite , however , the sky localization region can be large ( @xmath16 ) , and detection efficiency would be lost if the gw searches only used a single sky location . to resolve this problem ,",
    "searches for poorly localized grbs are done over a grid of sky positions , covering the sky localization region @xcite .",
    "we assume a systematic 68% coverage error circle for the fermi / gbm sky localizations with a radius of @xmath17 with 70% probability and a radius of @xmath18 with 30% probability @xcite , which is added in quadrature to the reported statistical error .",
    "each pipeline orders events found in the on - source time according to a ranking statistic . to reduce the effect of non - stationary background noise , candidate events",
    "are subjected to checks that `` veto '' events overlapping in time with known instrumental or environmental disturbances @xcite .",
    "the surviving event with the highest ranking statistic is taken to be the best candidate for a gravitational - wave signal for that grb ; it is referred to as the _ loudest event _ @xcite . to estimate the significance of the loudest event",
    ", the pipelines also analyze coincident data from a period surrounding the on - source data , where we do not expect a signal . the proximity of this _ off - source _ data to the on - source data makes it likely that the estimated background will properly reflect the noise properties in the on - source segment .",
    "the off - source data are processed identically to the on - source data ; in particular , the same data - quality cuts and consistency tests are applied , and the same sky positions relative to the gw detector network are used . if necessary , to increase the background distribution statistics , multiple time shifts are applied to the data streams from different detector sites , and the off - source data re - analyzed for each time shift .    to determine if a gw is present in the on - source data , the loudest on - source event is compared to the distribution of loudest off - source events .",
    "a p - value is defined as the probability of obtaining such an event or louder in the onsource , given the background distribution , under the null hypothesis .",
    "the triggers with the smallest p - values in the searches are subjected to additional followup studies to determine if the events can be associated with some non - gw noise artifact , for example due to an environmental disturbance .",
    "regardless of whether a statistically significant signal is present , we also set a 90% confidence level lower limit on the distance to the grb progenitor for various signal models .",
    "this is done by adding simulated gw signals to the data and repeating the analyses .",
    "these signals , which are drawn from astrophysically motivated distributions described in the following sections , are used to calculate the maximum distance for which there is a 90% or greater chance that such a signal model , if present in the on - source region , would have produced an event with larger ranking statistic than the largest value actually measured .",
    "the search procedure for gw bursts follows that used in the 2005 - 2007 grb search @xcite .",
    "all grbs are treated identically , without regard to redshift ( if known ) , fluence or classification .",
    "the on - source data are scanned by the  algorithm @xcite , which is designed to detect short gw bursts , @xmath9s , in the @xmath19hz frequency range .",
    "combines data from arbitrary sets of detectors , taking into account the antenna response and noise level of each detector to improve the search sensitivity .",
    "time - frequency maps of the combined data streams are scanned for clusters of pixels with energy significantly higher than that expected from background noise .",
    "the resulting candidate gw events are characterized by a ranking statistic based on energy .",
    "we also apply consistency tests based on the signal correlations measured between the detectors , assuming a circularly polarized gw , to reduce the number of background events .",
    "( the circular polarization assumption is motivated by the fact that the grb system rotation axis should be pointing roughly at the observer , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : signal : longgrb ] . ) the stringency of these tests is tuned by comparing their effect on background events and simulated signal events .",

    "this includes distributing injections across the sky according to the gamma - ray satellites sky location error box , and jittering the signal amplitude , phase , and timing in each detector according to the given detector calibration errors @xcite .",
    "this procedure also ensures that the consistency tests used in the analysis are loose enough to allow for such errors .",
    "the core of the coalescence search involves correlating the measured data against theoretically predicted waveforms using matched filtering @xcite .",
    "gws from the inspiral phase of a coalescence are modeled by post - newtonian approximants in the band of the detector s sensitivity for a wide range of binary masses @xcite .",
    "the expected gw signal depends on the masses and spins of the ns and its companion ( either ns or bh ) , as well as the distance to the source , its sky position , its inclination angle , and the polarization angle of the orbital axis .",
    "matched filtering is most sensitive to the phase evolution of the signal , which depends on the binary masses and spins , the time of merger , and a fiducial phase .",
    "the time and phase can be determined analytically . ignoring spin ,",
    "we can therefore perform matched filtering over a discrete two - dimensional bank of templates which span the space of component masses .",

    "the detector data streams are combined coherently and searched using the methods described in detail in @xcite .",

    "this is the first coherent search for coalescence signals ; it has been found to be more sensitive to gw signals than the coincidence technique used in previous triggered coalescence searches of ligo and virgo data @xcite .",
    "tests using the simulations described below have also shown that this focused coalescence search is a factor of @xmath82 more sensitive to coalescence signals than the unmodeled search described in the previous section , justifying the use of a specialized search for this signal type .    to estimate the efficiency of the search and calculate exclusion distances for short grbs , we draw simulations from two sets of astrophysically motivated compact binary systems : two neutron stars ( ns  ns ) ; and a neutron star with a black hole ( ns  bh ) .",
    "the ns masses are chosen from a gaussian distribution centered at 1.4@xmath34 @xcite with a width of 0.2@xmath34 for the ns ",

    "<S> for all grbs we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor , under the optimistic assumption of a gravitational - wave emission energy of @xmath0 at @xmath1 , with a median limit of 17mpc . for short hard grbs </S>",
    "<S> we place exclusion distances on binary neutron star and neutron star  </S>",
    "<S> black hole progenitors , using astrophysically motivated priors on the source parameters , with median values of 16mpc and 28mpc respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these distance limits , while significantly larger than for a search that is not aided by grb satellite observations , are not large enough to expect a coincidence with a grb . however , projecting these exclusions to the sensitivities of advanced ligo and virgo , which should begin operation in 2015 , we find that the detection of gravitational waves associated with grbs will become quite possible . </S>"
