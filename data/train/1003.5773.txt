    "alternatively , it could be argued that the mid - ir radiation of our sample is less polluted by the emission of hot dust heated by an agn , which could be a natural result of the rapid drop of the number density of agns above z=2 ( wall et al .",

( 2008 ) , comparing radio and uv data for @xmath72 lbgs in cosmos , inferred an average uv attenuation factor of @xmath73 , smaller than the average value of @xmath74 derived here and in other studies ( e.g. , reddy & steidel 2004 ; reddy et al .  2006 ) .",
    "we argue that the discrepancy arises from the fact that we focus on massive ( dusty ) lbgs with robust spectroscopic redshifts and compute dust attenuation on an object - by - object basis from the uv spectral slopes , whereas carilli et al .",
    "primarily use photometric redshifts , infer only an average attenuation and do not consider a mass - limited sample .",

    "this value is very close to the one presented by magdis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ( 4.5 gyr@xmath13 ) and is larger than that found at lower and higher redshifts , reinforcing their argument that the evolution of the ssfr peaks at @xmath163 .",

    "2007 ) .",
    "on the other hand , mips - lbgs have higher luminosities , indicating that ulirgs are present among the uv - selected galaxies at @xmath163 . for instance , hdfn - m23 which was individually detected in the radio , has l@xmath685(@xmath172)@xmath710@xmath15 l@xmath12 .",
    "we calculate the comoving volume for the redshift range of our sample ( 2.5@xmath25 z @xmath253.5 ) and find that the space density of ulirgs ( based on uv l@xmath9 ) lbgs is @xmath11.5@xmath170.5@xmath710@xmath18 mpc@xmath19 .",

    "the good agreement between sfr indicators that are affected by dust extinction ( uv ) or not ( mir , mm , radio ) suggests that the bulk of the star formation activity in massive uv - selected galaxies takes place in optically thin regions . since by focusing on the massive lbgs we also select those that are most affected by dust extinction ( e.g. , magdis et al .",
    "2010 ) , it is reasonable to extend this result to the whole population of uv galaxies including the less massive , less dusty lbgs .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the agreement holds even for the case of the most massive , dusty , 24@xmath4m - detected lbgs with l@xmath1410@xmath15 l@xmath12 , indicates that uv - selected ulirgs at z=3 are transparent to uv light , meaning that we can estimate its sfr given its rest - frame uv 1500 @xmath83 luminosity and uv slope , contrary to the local ulirgs and z=2 smgs .",

    "( 2006 ) for uv - selected and by daddi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for bzk selected z@xmath12 lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "both studies find that galaxies of a given bolometric luminosity are on average a factor of 8 - 10 less dust obscured at z@xmath12 than at the present epoch .",
    "the fact that our study suggests that at z@xmath13 ulirgs are optically thin at even higher l@xmath79 than that at z@xmath12 , indicates even less obscuration at z@xmath13 confirming the trend between galaxies at z = 0 , z @xmath1 1 , and z @xmath1 3 ( adelberger @xmath84 steidel 2000 ) .",
    "this could plausibly be explained as a result of increasing dust - to - gas ratios as we move from the high - z to the present universe .",
    "as galaxies evolve , they convert gas into stars which in turn enrich the interstellar medium with dust .",
    "if the dust distribution becomes more compact with time ( assuming mergers that drive dust and gas to the center of the galaxy ) the overall result would be an increase of the dust column density toward star - forming regions making ulirgs progressively optically opaque at later epochs .    to put constraints on the census of the cosmic star formation at z=3",
    ", we should also consider the missing fraction of star formation embedded in optically thick regions , that takes place in galaxies not selected in uv .",
    "on the other hand , there is evidence of decreasing obscuration with increasing redshift for a given l@xmath9 ( e.g. , reddy et 2008 ) , pointing towards less optically thick star - formation at higher redshifts . combining the above with the fact that the bulk of the currently known smgs are at @xmath162.2 ( chapman et al .",
    "2005 ) , we can assume that at z=3 the contribution of the smgs to the total sfr density , is not dominant , and hence locate the census of high - z star - formation in optically thin regions .",
    "we stress , that such a scenario can not be confirmed based solely on our sample , as it has been shown that the lyman break technique can miss a large fraction of massive ( dusty ) galaxies at high - z ( e.g. , daddi et al .",

    "<S> we present a multi - wavelength , uv - to - radio analysis for a sample of massive ( m@xmath0 @xmath1 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 ) irac- and mips 24@xmath4m - detected lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) with spectroscopic redshifts z@xmath13 in the goods - north field ( l@xmath5@xmath61.8@xmath7l@xmath8 ) . for lbgs without individual 24@xmath4 m detections , we employ stacking techniques at 24@xmath4 m , 1.1 mm and 1.4ghz , to construct the average uv - to - radio spectral energy distribution and find it to be consistent with that of a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) with l@xmath9=4.5@xmath10@xmath710@xmath11 l@xmath12 and a specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) of 4.3 gyr@xmath13 that corresponds to a mass doubling time @xmath1230 myrs . on the other hand , when considering the 24@xmath4m - detected lbgs we find among them galaxies with l@xmath1410@xmath15 l@xmath12 , indicating that the space density of @xmath163 uv - selected ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) is @xmath1(1.5@xmath170.5)@xmath710@xmath18 mpc@xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare measurements of star formation rates ( sfrs ) from data at different wavelengths and find that there is tight correlation ( kendall s @xmath20 99.7% ) and excellent agreement between the values derived from dust - corrected uv , mid - ir , mm and radio data for the whole range of l@xmath9 up to l@xmath9 @xmath1 10@xmath21 l@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this range is greater than that for which the correlation is known to hold at z@xmath12 , possibly due to the lack of significant contribution from pahs to the 24@xmath4 m flux at @xmath163 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that this agreement is observed for galaxies with l@xmath9 @xmath6 10@xmath15 l@xmath12 suggests that star - formation in uv - selected ulirgs , as well as the bulk of star - formation activity at this redshift , is not embedded in optically thick regions as seen in local ulirgs and submillimeter - selected galaxies at @xmath22 . </S>"
