    "yb or ce based compounds having elements with @xmath9-electrons display a rich variety of properties , including an enormous increase of the quasiparticle effective mass ( for heavy fermion ( hf ) system ) , a kondo insulating state , and unconventional superconductivity  @xcite . over the last two decades these properties attracted considerable interest of condensed matter physics .",
    "the qualitative representation of both hf and the kondo insulating state is based on the knowledge that ground state consequences from a competition between kondo and ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interactions  @xcite .",
    "if the rkky interaction dominates , the system orders magnetically .",
    "however , if the kondo interaction dominates , theory predicts that hybridization between localized @xmath9-electron and conduction carrier states should lead to the opening of a charge gap ( or pseudogap ) at the fermi energy  @xcite .",
    "though this picture is not in dispute , the well - defined predictions of the hybridization scenario have so far escaped direct experimental verification .",
    "one of the key predictions is a simple scaling relationship between the magnitude of the direct energy gap @xmath10 in the excitation spectrum and the enhancement of the effective mass of charge carriers @xmath11 in the coherent regime  @xcite .",
    "several hf materials , such as ceal@xmath12  @xcite , show no evidence of such a gap , whereas in prototypical compounds such as upt@xmath12 and uru@xmath3si@xmath3 the gap is attributed to a magnetic ground state  @xcite .",
    "caged type ce - based compounds with the general formula cet@xmath3al@xmath4 ( t = fe , ru and os ) have attracted considerable attention due to kondo semiconducting paramagnetic ground state ( down to 40 mk ) observed in cefe@xmath3al@xmath4  @xcite and anomalously high antiferro magnetic ( afm ) ordering temperature with spin gap formation at low temperatures in kondo semimetals ceru@xmath13al@xmath4 and ceos@xmath13al@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "afm ordering of these ce compounds is found to higher than gd compound which rule out the magnetic order is caused by simple rkky interaction . according to the de gennes scaling , @xmath14 ( nel temperature ) for a gd compound",
    "is expected to be 100 times of that for the ce counterpart if we neglect the crystal field effect and possible difference in the fermi surface .",
    "charge@xmath15density wave like instability is found in optical conductivity measurements for cet@xmath3al@xmath4 ( t = ru , os ) which develops along the @xmath16 axis at temperatures slightly higher than @xmath14 .",
    "it was suggested that this electronic instability induces the afm order  @xcite .",
    "the formation of long - range magnetic ordering out of the kondo semiconducting / semimetallic state itself is unexpected and these are the first examples of this mysterious coexistence of electronic ground states .",

    "<S> the effects of electron ( ir ) and hole ( re ) doping on the hybridization gap and antiferromagnetic order have been studied by magnetization , muon spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) , and inelastic neutron scattering on the polycrystalline samples of ce(os@xmath1ir@xmath2)@xmath3al@xmath4 ( @xmath5 = 0.08 and 0.15 ) and ceos@xmath6re@xmath7al@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0sr spectra clearly reveals magnetic ordering below 20 and 10 k for @xmath5 = 0.08 and 0.15 samples respectively with a very weak signature of oscillations of the muon initial asymmetry at very short time scale . </S>",
    "<S> our important findings are that small amount of electron doping ( i ) completely suppress the inelastic magnetic excitations near 11 mev down to 2k , which were observed in the undoped compound , and the response transforms into a broad quasielastic response and ( ii ) the internal field at the corresponding muon site is remarkably enhanced by about ten times compared with the parent compound . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand with small amount of hole ( 3% re ) doping the intensity of the inelastic magnetic excitations near 11 mev is reduced significantly . </S>",
    "<S> the main origin of the observed doping effect is an extra 5@xmath8 electrons being carried by ir and a hole carried by re compared with that the os atom . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results demonstrate a great sensitivity of the carrier doping and provides additional ways to study their anomalous magnetic properties . </S>"
