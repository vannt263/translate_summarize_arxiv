    "of the 274 galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) currently known @xcite , few are believed to be relatively young with ages of 3000 years or less .",
    "the list of young galactic snrs includes the historic guest stars of sn 1604 ( kepler s snr ) , sn 1572 ( tycho s snr ) , sn 1054 ( crab nebula ) , sn 1006 ( g327.6 + 14.6 ) , sn 386 ( g11.2 - 0.3 ) , and sn 185 ( rcw 86 ) .",
    "there are also about a dozen remnants which do not have firmly established ages but are probably less than a few thousand years old .",
    "these include the recently recognized very young remnant g1.9 + 0.3 ( age @xmath8 150 yr ; @xcite , @xcite ) and cassiopeia a ( sn @xmath9 1680 ; @xcite , @xcite ) .    with so few young snrs known",
    ", the discovery of even one more young galactic snr is significant .",
    "young snrs are of special interest since they offer a host of details on supernova explosions on finer spatial scales than from extragalactic snr investigations , including expansion asymmetries , ejecta abundances , and clues regarding the nature of the progenitor star and its pre - sn environment .",
    "hence the discovery of a small symmetric nebula , sstgfls j222557 + 601148 ( hereafter j222557 ) , detected in 24 @xmath2 m _ spitzer _ galactic first look survey ( gfls ) images and tentatively identified as a possible snr with an age @xmath10 yr by @xcite is worth investigating . here",
    "we present optical images and spectra which indicate this nebula is likely not a supernova remnant but instead a faint , high - excitation planetary nebula ( pn ) .",
    "both narrow and broad passband optical images of j222557 were obtained in september 2006 using a back - side illuminated 2048 x 2048 site ccd detector attached to the mcgraw - hill 1.3  m telescope at the mdm observatory ( mdm ) at kitt peak .",
    "the ccd s 24 micron size pixels gave an image scale of @xmath11 and a field of view of approximately @xmath12 square .",
    "the nebula was imaged on 2006 sept 27 using a pair of matched on and off h@xmath0 interference filters centered at 6568 and 6510   ( fwhm = 30  ) , a [ ] @xmath15007 filter ( fwhm = 30  ) , and a [ ] @xmath136716,6731 filter ( fwhm = 50  ) . on sept 28 broadband images using a harris b filter were also taken .",
    "individual image exposure times for all filters were 1000 s taken in sets of two or three .",
    "additional images of j222557 were obtained on 2008 july 30 using the mdm 2.4 m hiltner telescope with the retrocam ccd camera @xcite .",
    "images were taken using sdss filters @xmath14 and @xmath15 with exposure times of @xmath16 and @xmath17 s. conditions at the time of the observations were believed to be photometric with seeing around 1.5@xmath18 .",
    "images were flux calibrated with standard stars from @xcite .",
    "standard pipeline data reduction of all images was performed using iraf / stsdas .",
    "this included debiasing , flat - fielding , and cosmic ray and hot pixel removal .",
    "follow - up low - dispersion optical spectra of j222557 were obtained on 2008 july 31 using the mdm 2.4 m telescope with a modular spectrograph and @xmath19 pixel site ccd detector . a north - south 1.2@xmath20 slit and a 600 line mm@xmath5 5000   blaze grism",
    "was used to obtain @xmath17 s exposures spanning the spectral region @xmath21   with a resolution of 6 ",
    ". the slit was placed over the bright southeast region as seen in the 24 @xmath2 m _ spitzer _ image .",
    "conditions were good but not photometric with 1.5@xmath18 seeing .",
    "these spectra were reduced and calibrated employing standard techniques in iraf with standard stars from @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , a faint h@xmath0 emission shell at the location of j222557 can be seen amidst considerable diffuse h@xmath0 emission and numerous dust lanes . in figure 2",
    ", we show enlargements of the h@xmath0 , h@xmath0 @xmath22 continuum , and [ ] @xmath15007 images of this optical shell .",
    "the [ ] and h@xmath0 @xmath22 continuum images are shown smoothed by a 5 point gaussian .",
    "the optical shell has angular dimensions of @xmath23 .",
    "this size is consistent with dimensions of @xmath24 reported by @xcite based on the _ spitzer _ mips 24 @xmath2 m image which is also shown , smoothed by a 3 point gaussian .",
    "no emission from the shell was seen in the [ ] @xmath36716,6731 image despite being of similar or longer exposure times to those of h@xmath0 and [ ] .    in figure 3",
    ", we present our low - dispersion optical spectra of j222557 taken with a n - s oriented slit positioned along the eastern portion of the ring ( see fig .  2 , middle panel ) .",
    "narrow , unresolved ( fwhm @xmath25 6  ) emission lines of h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath36548 , 6583 were detected from both southern and northern limbs .",
    "no high - velocity emission was detected from either the nebula s shell or from any possible interior emission not visible in our narrow passband images .",
    "the observed h@xmath0 flux from the brighter southern limb knot is approximately @xmath26 erg s@xmath5 @xmath27 with an uncertainty around 50% due to non - photometric conditions .",
    "the [ ] @xmath16583 line was stronger than the h@xmath0 for both northern and southern portions of the nebula s shell , with i ( [ ] 6583 + 6548)/i(h@xmath0 ) @xmath8 2.7 for the bright southern knot .",
    "no [ ] @xmath36716,6731 emission was detected in our spectra from the nebula , consistent with the lack of any emission seen on the narrow passband [ ] image .",
    "there was also no [ ] line emission detected in the spectrum despite the detected [ ] @xmath15007 emission from the shell in the [ ] image .",
    "we attribute the absence of detected [ ] in the spectrum due to a combination of a i ( [ ] @xmath15007/i(h@xmath0 ) @xmath28 1 , considerable line of sight extinction as suggested by the numerous dust lanes in the region ( see fig .  1 ) , and a lower sensitivity of our spectral setup at @xmath29   compared to the @xmath30   region .",
    "as noted by @xcite , there is no previously known optical , radio , or x - ray nebula at the location of j222557 .",
    "the object is not a cataloged planetary nebula @xcite or a known galactic nebula @xcite , there is no coincident radio source in either the westerbork 325 mhz northern sky survey ( wenss ) or the nrao vla sky survey 1.4 ghz , and no associated x - ray emission is visible in the rosat all sky survey .",
    "the shell is also unlikely to be a wolf - rayet ring nebula due to the lack of a luminous point source in i band , 2mass and irac images .",
    "below , we discuss the nature of the j222557 nebula in light of these optical observations , first discussing a young supernova remnant scenario and then the object as a possible planetary nebula .",
    "unusual infrared colors and a pure emission line @xmath31 @xmath2 m spectrum with no sign of dust continuum or hydrogen emission lines led @xcite to examine the possibility of j222557 being a young supernova remnant ( snr ) . although snrs are usually relatively strong emitters of x - rays and nonthermal radio emissions , they argued that the object s lack of any such emissions did not exclude it from being identified as a snr if the object were relatively distant and/or if the snr were relatively young with little interaction with the ism .",
    "they noted the nebula s size ( dia @xmath32 ) was consistent with a young snr at a distance @xmath33 kpc with an average expansion velocity of a few 1000 km s@xmath5 .",
    "such a large distance would also place the object well above the galactic plane ( z @xmath8 400 pc ) which would help explain a lack of ism interaction and hence its low radio and x - ray luminosity .    as additional support for a snr identification , @xcite cited j222557 s similar morphology and size to the smc remnant 1e @xmath34 and the young galactic snr cassiopeia a ( cas a ) , both of which are oxygen - rich , core - collapse remnants .",
    "they noted 1e @xmath34 s strong 24 @xmath2 m emission and absence in other _ spitzer _",
    "ir imaging bands @xcite much like that seen for j222557 .",
    "indeed , many snrs exhibit strong 24 @xmath2 m emission and a faintness in shorter ir bands and this type of sed is illustrated in the 3.6 , 8.0 , and 24 @xmath2 m composite color image of the young galactic core - collapse snr g11.3 - 0.3 shown in @xcite .",
    "@xcite also compared j222557 s irs spectrum with that of cas a @xcite .",
    "they found similar and consistent line ratios if j222557 had higher shock velocities than cas a s @xmath35 km s@xmath5 in the ejected sn material of around 450 - 500 km s@xmath5 .",
    "however , the presence of only narrow h@xmath0 and [ ] emissions with no high - velocity ( v @xmath4 km s@xmath5 ) emission lines seen in either the optical or ir , plus no coincident x - ray or nonthermal radio emissions make a snr interpretation unlikely .",
    "while much of the observed emission structure seen in our optical images is concentrated in a thin shell where large radial velocities would not be expected , there is some interior optical emission ( fig .  1 ) and one of the two _ spitzer _ irs spectra obtained by @xcite was taken of the shell s center and yet showed no hint of high - velocity .",
    "our optical spectrum also revealed no emission from [ ] @xmath36300,6364 or [ ] @xmath37319,7330 which would be expected if the nebula contained o - rich ejecta as seen in 1e @xmath34 and parts of cas a. moreover , the absence [ ] @xmath36716,6731 , which is the dominant line emission in much of cas a s ejecta , also greatly weakens an analogy with this remnant .",
    "@xcite also discussed the possibility that j222557 might be a young snr associated with a thermonuclear type ia sn explosion , noting that strong 24 @xmath2 m emission but weaker emission at @xmath36 @xmath2 m has been observed in snrs associated with this type of sn .",
    "for example , @xcite studied four lmc type ia remnants and found none were detected in the the _ spitzer _ irac bands . @xcite found a similar situation in some outer regions of the lmc remnants n49 and n63a which were attributed to line emissions from [ ] 25.9 @xmath2 m and [ ] 24.5 and 26.0 @xmath2 m .",
    "the morphology of the j222557 nebula certainly resembles the faint thin shells of young type ia snrs such as tycho and several young lmc remnants , and @xcite made a cautious comparison of j222557 to the bilaterally symmetric shell of the type ia sn 1006 remnant .",
    "young type ia snrs exhibit a spectrum dominated by low - velocity balmer lines of hydrogen as a result of high - velocity shocks moving through a partially neutral medium leading to the production of strong narrow and much weaker broad balmer lines before complete ionization occurs @xcite .",
    "however , a young type ia snr scenario for j222557 is also inconsistent with its observed optical spectrum .",
    "elements other than hydrogen are also collisionally ionized in the postshock region and may emit line photons , but in the case of neutral atoms and relatively low - ionization ions , a line s luminosity is proportional to its ionization time and elemental abundance .",
    "this leads to relatively weak metal lines compared to the hydrogen balmer lines .",
    "thus the [ ] @xmath16583 line emissions seen in the j222557 spectrum at levels actually stronger than h@xmath0 for both northern and south rims effectively rules out the optical nebula being due to a fast shock like that seen in the spectra of young type ia snrs .",
    "finally , the lack of detected [ ] @xmath37 in either our deep [ ] image or optical spectra of j222557 is also inconsistent with the j222557 nebula being an older , more evolved snr . due to an extended postshock cooling zone in remnants with shock velocities below 1000 km s@xmath5 ,",
    "the presence of strong [ ] emission is one of the chief identifiers of shock heated gas and has been widely used to discriminate between photoionized nebulae such as h ii regions and planetary nebulae .",
    "virtually all evolved snrs show [ ] : h@xmath0 @xmath38 whereas h ii regions typically exhibit values @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the axial symmetry and limb brightened emission observed in j222557 are strongly suggestive of a pn nature as @xcite themselves discuss .",
    "however , they rejected this identification based on its peculiar infrared colors , the absence of an ir bright central source often seen in pne , and its _ spitzer _ irs spectrum which showed no continuum emission or hydrogen lines and no dust emission features commonly seen in pne",
    ".    nonetheless , a pn nature seems more likely given its optical properties .",
    "emission line expansion velocities under 100 km s@xmath5 , relatively weak [ ] @xmath36716,6731 emission ( i([])/i(h@xmath40 , ) and a morphology consistent with a limb brightened shell with some interior emission knots are properties frequently seen in pne .",
    "the observed high i ( [ ] 6583 + 6548)/i(h@xmath0 ) @xmath41 ratio is also often observed in pne due to an overabundance of nitrogen in post - ms mass loss material @xcite .",
    "small ( @xmath42 ) ring and shell morphology nebulae bright at 24 @xmath2 m but faint at 3.6 - 8.0 @xmath2 m are not unusual in the galactic plane and some of these are suspected pne @xcite .",
    "j222557 s observed infrared flux of less than 0.1 mjy sr@xmath5 at the four irac channels ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath2 m ) but about 10 mjy sr@xmath5 at 24 @xmath2 m indicates a steeply rising sed .",
    "this sed is commonly seen for pne due in part to significant continuum emission from warm dust @xcite .",
    "the bright appearance of pne in mips 24 @xmath2 m images is due to both dust emission and [ ] 24.3 @xmath2 m and [ ] 25.9 @xmath2 m line emissions @xcite .    the chief difficulty in assigning a pn identification to the j222557 nebula lies in an absence of appreciable dust continuum emission . the nebula s non - detection in the four irac 3.6  8.0 @xmath2 m images and the 70 or 160 @xmath2 m mips images @xcite sets strong limits on the presence of warm or cool dust .",
    "the irs spectrum of j222557 is consistent with the irac and mips images , showing a purely emission line spectrum with virtually no continuum or dust features , but with strong [ ] 25.9 @xmath2 m line emission explaining its detection in the mips 24 @xmath2 m image .",
    "however , @xcite found that the relative importance of nebular line emissions and dust continuum emission in the 24 @xmath2 m band for pne depends on the temperature of the central star and distribution of dust and gas in the nebula . using a sample of 28 pne",
    ", they also found that smaller pne exhibited 24 @xmath2 m emission that was more extended than their h@xmath0 emission and concluded that this extended 24 @xmath2 m emission was dominated by dust emission .",
    "larger pne , in contrast , show much weaker dust emission with the [ ] line tending to dominate the emission in the mips 24 @xmath2 m band .",
    "these results are in accord with @xcite who found the largest pn in the lmc and smc exhibited the least dust continuum emission .",
    "our optical spectral data are also consistent with j222557 being a pn in terms of its size .",
    "we measured v@xmath43 km s@xmath5 from the observed h@xmath0 line emission , which is consistent with galactic rotation at its @xmath44 and a location inside the perseus arm at a distance of @xmath45 kpc @xcite . with a @xmath46",
    ", a distance of @xmath47 kpc , j222557 would lie some @xmath48 pc above the galactic plane . at a distance of 2 to 3 kpc , j222557 s angular radius of 40@xmath18",
    "implies a linear radius of around @xmath49 pc @xmath50 ( d/2.5 kpc ) which is near the median size of pne @xcite .",
    "interestingly , some 20% of all pne are not detected in the radio and a size @xmath51 pc would indicate a well evolved pn which might help explain j222557 s lack of detected radio emission .",
    "finally , we have identified a possible planetary nebula central star ( cspn ) candidate . a blueish point source near j222557 s center",
    "is detected in our b , @xmath14 and @xmath15 images , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "figure 2 ( bottom row ) shows our harris b and sdss @xmath15 filter images of the nebula with the candidate central exciting star indicated .",
    "this star s location places it nearly centered in the nebula as shown by the cross in the h@xmath0 @xmath54 continuum difference image .    with an uncertain distance and line of sight extinction , and only very weak detections in our broadband images , it is difficult to accurately assess the cspn candidate s intrinsic color or luminosity .",
    "at @xmath55 , it would rank among the faintest galactic cspn known @xcite .",
    "however , adopting a distance of 2.5 kpc and an a@xmath56 mag based h  i measurements for @xmath57 and @xmath46 and conversions of n(h ) into a@xmath58 values for a typical gas to dust ratio @xcite , the candidate would have m@xmath59 , a value quite consistent for cspn in evolved pne @xcite .",
    "moreover , given the strength of [ ] , the nebula is likely to have considerable emission which would place a lower limit of @xmath8 60,000 k for the star s effective temperature @xcite .",
    "morris et al . ( 2006 ) tentatively identified the galactic nebula j222557 + 601148 as a young supernova remnant ( snr ) based _ spitzer _ galactic first look survey images .",
    "however , h@xmath0 , [ ] , [ ] images and low dispersion optical spectra reveal it to only exhibit narrow h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath36548,6583 line emissions with no evidence of broad or high - velocity line emissions .",
    "the absence of any high - velocity optical or infrared features , the presence of relatively strong [ ] emissions , a lack of detected [ ] emission which would indicate the presence of shock - heated gas , plus no coincident x - ray or nonthermal radio emissions suggest the nebula is unlikely to be a snr , young or old .",
    "instead , it is likely a faint , high - excitation pn as its elliptical morphology would suggest , lying at a distance @xmath60 kpc with strong [ ] emission rather than dust continuum emission dominating it detection in 24 @xmath2 m _ spitzer _ images .",
    "we have identified a possible central star candidate with @xmath61 .",
