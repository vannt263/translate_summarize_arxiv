    "in part i of this series of papers @xcite ( partly inspired by @xcite ) we have considered the general framework of local ( and global ) zeta regularization of a neutral scalar field in a @xmath4-dimensional spatial domain @xmath5 , in the environment of @xmath6-dimensional minkowski spacetime ; the possible presence of an external potential @xmath7 was taken into account as well . in the present part",
    "iii we consider a massless field on @xmath8 , and choose for @xmath7 a harmonic potential .",
    "the potential is assumed to be isotropic , i.e. , to be proportional to the squared radius @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) ; nevertheless , our approach could be extended with little effort to anisotropic harmonic potentials and to the case of a massive scalar field .",
    "the main result of this paper is the renormalization of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for the stress - energy tensor , obtained applying the general framework of part i to the present configuration ; we also discuss the total energy in this configuration . after producing general integral representations for both the renormalized stress - energy vev and the total energy , we consider in detail the cases of spatial dimension @xmath11 .",
    "the above mentioned integral representations are derived analytically and are fully explicit ; however , the integrals therein must be computed numerically .",
    "we have performed these latter computations for @xmath11 , using @xmath12 . using the previously cited integral representation ,",
    "it is also possible to derive the asymptotics for the stress - energy tensor components when the radius @xmath13 goes to zero or to infinity ; we derive , as well , remainder estimates for these asymptotic expansions as well .",
    "the idea to replace sharp boundaries with suitable background potentials is well - known in the literature on the casimir effect .",
    "typically ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , delta - like potentials are introduced in order to mimic boundary conditions in a `` physically more realistic '' framework ; the ultimate purpose is to obtain less singular behaviours of the renormalized quantities , avoiding , e.g. , boundary divergences such as the ones pointed out in parts i and ii @xcite .",
    "the case of a scalar field interacting with an external harmonic potential has been formerly considered by actor and bender @xcite , who have determined the renormalized vev of the total energy via global zeta regularization ; to the best of our knowledge , local aspects such as the stress - energy tensor have never been considered previously for the present configuration . the paper is organized as follows . in section [ gloss ]",
    "we present a summary of basic results from part i ; as in part ii , the purpose of the summary is to save the reader from the tedious task of recovering from part i the general identities applied here . in section [ secharm ] ( and in the related appendix [ appii ] ) we discuss the general approach to treat the case of a scalar field interacting with a classical , isotropic harmonic potential in arbitrary spatial dimension @xmath4 ; this includes general expressions for the renormalized stress - energy vev , its asymptotics for @xmath13 small or large and for the renormalized vev of the total energy ( more precisely , for the bulk energy as defined in part i ) .",
    "the main ingredients in the derivation of the above results are : i ) the general results of part i relating the zeta regularization to the heat kernel of fundamental operator @xmath14 ; ii ) the fact that , when @xmath15 is harmonic , the related heat kernel is the well - known mehler kernel @xcite ( also see @xcite ) . in section [ harmd123 ] ,",
    "the analysis presented in the preceeding sections is specified to the cases of spatial dimension @xmath11 .",
    "we point out that results on the renormalized bulk energy agree with the ones of actor and bender @xcite for @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , it should be mentioned that these authors compute the analytic continuations required by the zeta approach using ad hoc results on continuation the special functions involved in this specific case ; on the contrary , here we are applying mechanically the general setting discussed in part i , in the spirit of the present series of papers .",
