    "spectroscopic observations and analyses have been and will be an essential tool in discovering the intricate details in the formation of a classical t tauri star , as the spectral lines carry information on the kinematics and physical conditions of the gases close to the star .",
    "thus , red absorptions extending to velocities in excess of @xmath20 in balmer lines and the @xmath4 doublet ( appenzeller & wolf 1977 , edwards et al .",
    "1994 ) indicate active accretion .",
    "blue absorptions are rare in optical lines , but are seen in balmer lines , so there is also hint of outflows .",
    "in addition , the profiles of forbidden lines like @xmath21\\lambda 6300 $ ] and @xmath22\\lambda 6731 $ ] reveal the often presence of jet - like flows ( kwan & tademaru 1988 , hirth , mundt , & solf 1994 ) .",
    "even though the forbidden line emission originate at densities much lower than expected values in the vicinity of the star , the high speed of the jet signals that the outflow likely starts from a deep potential well as either a stellar wind or an inner disk wind that is subsequently collimated . in that case",
    "ejection of matter is as inherent a characteristic as accretion of matter in the star formation process .",
    "ultimately the unravelling of the contributions to the line intensities and profiles from different kinematic flows and the derivation of quantitative measures like mass flow rates require modelling and analysis of the strong emission lines .",
    "natta et al .",
    "( 1988 ) first examined the excitation and ionization of hydrogen in a stellar wind and found that the hydrogen line fluxes calculated for the same mass loss rate can span a wide range owing to differences in the gas temperature and in the stellar balmer continuum .",
    "hartmann et al .",
    "( 1990 ) modelled both line fluxes and profiles in a stellar wind which , driven by alfven waves , is characterised by large turbulent velocities in the accelerating portion of the flow .",
    "while the calculated fluxes cover the observed range , the balmer line profiles are clearly unlike observed ones in being highly asymmetric with the red side much stronger than the blue side .",
    "the weakness of the blue side occurs because while the bulk of the hydrogen emission arise from the inner , denser and highly turbulent region , the outer , less strongly excited expanding envelope blocks the blue emission to an observer .",
    "mitskevich , natta , & grinin ( 1993 ) also modelled the @xmath9 profile by postulating a flow that accelerates to a peak velocity and then decelerates towards zero .",
    "this double - valued velocity structure will produce an anomaly between the red and blue emission of an optically thick line at intermediate velocities , as the blue(red ) emission will then arise from the outer(inner ) part of the surface of constant observed velocity ( @xmath17 ) , where the excitation temperature is lower(higher ) .",
    "then , to account for the observed ranges in shape and depth of the apparent blue absorption , mitskevich et al .",
    "( 1993 ) advocated a clumpy flow for the flexibility in varying the degree of shielding between the outer and inner parts of the constant @xmath17 surface .",
    "they , however , adopted a parametric function for the dependence of the line excitation temperature on position , and it is not clear if the observed fluxes and profiles of several balmer lines can be reproduced self - consistently .",
    "the higher balmer lines , as well as @xmath23 and @xmath24 occasionally show red absorptions ( edwards et al .",
    "1994 , folha & emerson 2001 ) . the clear indication of an infalling flow by the broad red absorption , and the realization that the optical / uv continuum excess can arise from the impact footpoints on the star ( calvet & gullbring 1998 ) likely contribute to motivating the studies of hydrogen emission in an accretion flow from the disk along a dipolar trajectory ( muzerolle , calvet , & hartmann 1998a , 2001 , kurosawa , romanova , & harries 2008 ) .",
    "the model hydrogen line fluxes generally agree with observed values and the model line profiles are centrally peaked with small blue centroids .",
    "the much better comparison of these calculated profiles with observed ones , in conjunction with findings of strong magnetic field strengths ( johns - krull 2007 ) and theoretical investigations that probe the initiation of the accretion flow and the associated angular momentum exchange between disk and star ( knigl & pudritz 2000 , mohanty & shu 2008 , romanova et al .",
    "2007 ) spurs the burst of activities on the current paradigm of magnetospheric accretion .    while magnetospheric accretion clearly occurs , the origin of the hydrogen emission in the accretion flow is not without question . on observational grounds",
    "the main issue is the narrow width of the model line profile ( folha & emerson 2001 , kurosawa et al .",
    "other issues concern the observed high blue wing velocities , stronger blue emission at the line wings , and the sometimes large blue centroids .",
    "these characteristics are used as arguments against the @xmath10 emission originating in the accretion flow ( beristain , edwards , & kwan 2001 , hereafter bek01 ) , but are also present in observed hydrogen profiles ( folha & emerson 2001 ) . with the advance of infrared spectroscopy ,",
    "it is natural to follow up the @xmath10 study by observing the @xmath6 line which , being the transition immediately below @xmath10 , will have a higher opacity and be more effective in absorbing the stellar and veiling continua .",
    "the ensuing @xmath25 spectroscopic survey of 38 cttss ( edwards et al . 2006 , hereafter efhk06 ) indeed produces additional information not conveyed by previously observed lines .",
    "it reveals that @xmath6 has the strongest propensity of showing absorption features , including broad blue absorptions indicative of radial outflows , sharp , narrow , blue absorptions indicative of disk winds ( kwan , edwards , & fischer 2007 ) , red absorptions some of which are so broad and deep that challenge conventional assumptions of accretion flow structure ( fischer et al .",
    "2008 ) , and central absorptions .",
    "the new @xmath25 observational results bring forth several new insights into the problem of helium and hydrogen line formation in cttss .",
    "first , the significant @xmath6 optical depth ( @xmath26 or higher ) in several different kinematic flows , together with the high excitation energy ( @xmath27 ) of its lower state , suggests that excitation via uv photoionization needs to be considered .",
    "second , with the establishment of frequent presence of radial outflows , the issue regarding the comparatively rare occurrence of broad blue absorptions in balmer lines now concerns the structures and physical conditions of those winds .",
    "third , @xmath6 emission is common and comparable in strength to @xmath11 emission among the cttss with the strongest hydrogen lines ( efhk06 ) .",
    "origin of the helium emission in an accretion flow faces high hurdles because of the arguments put forth earlier with respect to the @xmath10 emission , and because the physical conditions needed for strong @xmath1 emission ( e.g. , @xmath28 ) may be taxing for a flow in which the gas is primarily in free fall . if the @xmath1 emission originate in a radial wind , hydrogen emission from the wind",
    "may also be significant , as it is more easily produced , and needs to be re - examined .",
    "we will attempt to address the above issues in this paper .",
    "unlike earlier investigations which adopt a particular flow structure and evaluate how the model line fluxes and/or profiles fare with observations , we take a simpler but hopefully more general approach .",
    "we first calculate the atomic / ionic excitation at a local point and determine how the line opacites depend on the local physical conditions .",
    "we will use the observed relative opacities among the lines to shed light on the requisite physical conditions .",
    "the local excitation calculations also produce line emissivity ratios that can be compared with observed line flux ratios to further delimit the physical conditions .",
    "these local excitation results should be fairly independent of the flow structure .",
    "then , to contrast between the outflow and infall velocity fields , we note that a major difference lies in the emission area contributing to the observed flux at a high @xmath29 and calculate the specific fluxes of the more important lines at @xmath30 for both a radial wind and an accretion flow .",
    "crucial to our endeavor is an observational data set that covers simultaneously both optical and @xmath25 spectral regions .",
    "@xmath6 is a key line because of its propensity in showing absorption features , thereby indicating presences of particular kinematic structures .",
    "deriving strong constraints on the physical conditions giving rise to @xmath6 formation , however , needs another helium line , and @xmath10 is ideal both for its being a fairly strong line and its position as antecedent of @xmath6 in a radiative cascade .",
    "such a data set of cttss , observed at optical and @xmath25 wavelengths simultaneously or nearly simultaneously has been procured by edwards et al .",
    "only a few of the objects are selected for use here to provide line ratios that are key to unravelling the origins of the line emission .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the rationale and methodology of our model calculations in the next section and give details of the atomic / ionic models employed in  3 .",
    "we present in  4 the relevant observational information . in ",
    " 5 , 6 , 7 we present model results and compare them with observational data on line opacities , flux ratios , and specific fluxes respectively to delimit the requisite physical conditions .",
    "we summarize the findings thus deduced in those three sections and utilize them , together with other observational information , to decide on the locations of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 broad emission in  8 .",
    "we discuss the implications of our proposed origins of the line emission in  9 , and review the major conclusions in  10 .",
    "the line emission from a gas depends on the local physical conditions and the radiative transfer . for three of the four kinematic structures revealed by the @xmath31 absorptions the high speed of each flow and the consequent large velocity gradients present isolate the radiative interaction to a region small in comparison with the overall size of the kinematic structure .",
    "then if the physical conditions within that region are taken to be uniform , both the excitation of the gas and the consequent line emission depend only on local physical quantities , namely , density , kinetic temperature , and velocity gradient .",
    "the spontaneous emission , stimulated absorption and emission of photons in a line together produce an effective emission rate given by @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being the spontaneous emission rate and @xmath34 the escape probability given by @xmath35 , where the line optical depth @xmath36 depends on the local population @xmath37 of the lower(upper ) level and the velocity gradient @xmath38 ( sobolev 1960 ) .",
    "the local emissivity of the line ( @xmath39 ) is then @xmath40 .",
    "we take advantage of the above reduction of a global radiative transfer problem to a local one in generating model results for comparison with observational data",
    ". we will be primarily interested in the stellar wind and the accretion flow in our attempt to ascertain the origin of the broad line emission .",
    "we consider a point roughly in the middle of the flow , specifically at a distance @xmath41 from the star where the flow speed @xmath42 reaches @xmath43 .",
    "the calculated line opacity at this position is taken to be representative , and the ordering in magnitude of the opacities of different lines will be compared with the observational ordering of the lines in propensity of showing an absorption to delimit the requisite physical conditions . the local ratio of emissivities of two lines will also be compared with the observed line flux ratio .",
    "this appears to be , at first sight , a gross approximation , since each line flux is an integration of the emissivity over the entire kinematic structure and clearly the density at other parts of the flow , at least , is likely several times larger or smaller than the value at @xmath44 .",
    "however , the same local excitation calculation applies to all positions , only for different physical parameters , so when the value of an emissivity ratio is presented as a function of density and temperature , one can judge from the dependences how the results will be affected when averaged over a range of density and/or temperature .",
    "the local model calculation has the advantage of enabling us to explore a much broader parameter space , e.g. over four orders of magnitude in density span , as well as to include many more lines , both from a given atom by incorporating more energy levels and from different atoms .",
    "it will be seen later that a comparison of different emissivity ratios with observed line flux ratios does indicate clearly enough the necessary physical conditions for us to infer the source of the line emission , and that this deduction is not affected by the mentioned approximation .    for the stellar wind",
    "we assume radial streamlines from the star .",
    "the velocity gradient transverse to the radial direction is @xmath45 .",
    "we expect the velocity gradient in the radial direction to be larger , for an acceleration of the gas sufficiently strong to enable the gas to escape .",
    "when the velocity gradient is not isotropic the escape probability is dependent on direction .",
    "we will not be concerned with this nuance , and simply assume an effective isotropic velocity gradient of @xmath46 .",
    "the error in this estimate is not significant since the velocity gradient enters only as a factor in the line opacity and is always multiplied with the density , which varies over a much broader range .",
    "we take @xmath47 to illustrate the stellar wind model .",
    "we also assume radial streamlines toward the star for the accretion flow . at @xmath48 the infall trajectory , even in the dipolar geometry ,",
    "is approaching radial .",
    "the investigation of @xmath6 red absorptions also finds that some red absorptions are so broad and strong that they are accounted for best by radial infall ( fischer et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the same radial geometry also facilitates comparison of the model results between the two flows .",
    "a gas particle infalling onto a star of @xmath49 and @xmath50 will attain a speed of @xmath43 at @xmath51 and @xmath52 if it starts from @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively , so we take @xmath41 to be @xmath55 for the accretion flow , and assume an effective isotropic velocity gradient of @xmath46 .",
    "the latter assumption can be quite wrong because , unlike the stellar wind , the accretion flow at high speeds fills only a very small solid angle , and the above work on red absorptions also finds that the infall streamlines may not uniformly fill the solid angle . in this case",
    "the velocity gradient is better given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the thermal / turbulence line width and @xmath58 the transverse size of an infall bundle .",
    "we have no grasp on @xmath58 and only note that @xmath56 may be closer to @xmath46 even if @xmath58 is very different from @xmath41 . as mentioned before",
    ", the velocity gradient enters into the opacity with the density , which is varied over a wide range , and emissivity ratios will be presented also as a function of line opacity , so the effect of a very different velocity gradient can still be gleaned from the results .",
    "the difference between the assumed velocity gradients for the two flows is not large .",
    "it will also be seen that the model results depend much more strongly on density than the velocity gradient , so a change in the latter can be compensated by a much smaller change in the former .",
    "thus the calculated dependences of the local line opacities and emissivity ratios on physical conditions are applicable to all flow structures with a comparable velocity gradient to within an order of magnitude .",
    "the specific flux of a line , on the other hand , depends on the volume of emission , so it is sensitive to @xmath41 , the actual flow geometry , and the velocity at which it is calculated .",
    "in particular , because the correlation of velocity with position is vastly different between the stellar wind and accretion flow , we expect their line fluxes to be quite different , even if line emissivity ratios are similar .",
    "it is with this consideration in mind that @xmath44 is specifically chosen .",
    "we think the line flux near this velocity or higher is a truer test of the accretion flow model than that near zero velocity , as it is much more constrained .",
    "independent of the accretion flow geometry , the emission at high speeds must arise from distances quite close to the star .",
    "then the focussing of the streamlines toward the star confines the solid angle of the accretion flow at high speeds , which is also constrained by the small area covering factor , typically @xmath59 ( calvet & gullbring 1998 ) , of the shocks marking the accretion footpoints .",
    "thus the emission volume of the gas at a high speed is well constrained , thereby making the corresponding line flux a more revealing diagnostic .",
    "the observed line emission at @xmath60 arise from locations at distances other than @xmath41 because emission from positions with higher speeds than @xmath61 also contribute when their projected velocities along the line of sight equal @xmath17 . to calculate it for the stellar wind we assume that from @xmath41 to @xmath62 the flow speed increases linearly from @xmath61 to @xmath63 .",
    "when the line is optically thick the observed flux at @xmath17 depends on the excitation temperature and the projected area with an observed velocity of @xmath17 . in figure 1 the right dashed curve shows , in the @xmath64 plane , the contour of @xmath65 for a spherical wind .",
    "it can be seen that the projected area equals @xmath66 or @xmath67 . when the line is optically thick the observed specific flux is then , in the simple case of a constant excitation temperature , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the excitation temperature between the upper and lower levels , and @xmath70 is the distance to the star . when the line is optically thin , the observed flux is obtained from integrating the line emissivity over volume .",
    "if the latter varies with distance @xmath71 from the star as @xmath72 , the observed specific flux is @xmath73 both @xmath74 and @xmath75 are determined at @xmath41 . for @xmath76 between @xmath77 and @xmath78 the integral ranges from @xmath79 to @xmath80 . substituting the expression for @xmath75 given earlier in the denominator ,",
    "the factor in front of the integral can be rewritten as @xmath81 in order that , when a line transits from optically thin to optically thick , the observed specific flux increases smoothly to the earlier limit for an optically thick line , we choose the integral to be @xmath82 or an @xmath76 of @xmath83 .",
    "the error in deriving the flux of an optically thin line is then about @xmath84% .",
    "it turns out that , with the exception of @xmath85 , the other lines studied are all optically thick under the physical conditions responsible for the observed line emission .",
    "the error in the specific flux of an optically thick line arises mostly from the assumption of a constant excitation temperature , but one can gauge from the presented results how a distribution of density or temperature affects @xmath86 .    for a spherical radial infall",
    "the calculation of the specific flux when a line is optically thin is analogous to the spherical wind case .",
    "it involves integration from @xmath87 to @xmath41 with an infall velocity distribution , and is also made to ensure a smooth transition between the optically thin and thick regimes . in the latter regime",
    "the specific flux depends on the projected area , and the contour of @xmath65 is shown by the left dashed curve in figure 1 .",
    "the corresponding projected area is @xmath88 .",
    "this much smaller projected area at @xmath89 is a fundamental characteristic of any accretion flow model .",
    "the contrast against the stellar wind value is even larger when the small solid angle of the accretion flow near the star is taken into account .",
    "when the wind / infall is not spherical , the projected area depends on viewing angle , but we will not consider this nuance and simply obtain the observed line flux by multiplying the result for the spherical case by the filling factor of the flow in solid angle , @xmath90 .",
    "for the stellar wind and accretion flow we adopt @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively , keeping in mind that the @xmath6 line sometimes shows strong emission but only a highly displaced shallow blue absorption ( kwan et al . 2007 ) , and that @xmath93 is needed to model the few very strong red absorptions ( fischer et al .",
    "occultation of the line emission by the star and the disk is not taken into account .",
    "if it were , it can be seen from figure 1 that in the infall case the line flux at @xmath94 would be severely curtailed .",
    "three physical parameters are important for the local excitation calculations .",
    "they are density , temperature , and ionization flux .",
    "the range of kinetic temperature , @xmath95 , investigated is @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "we use the hydrogen nucleon number density , @xmath98 , to indicate the number density , and assume a solar composition of the gas . with the number density of @xmath99 being in the ratio @xmath100 ( lodders 2003 ) , the total nucleon number density is then @xmath101 and the mass density is @xmath102 , with @xmath103 being the mass of the hydrogen atom . the range of @xmath98 explored is @xmath104 to @xmath105 . for a laminar flow the mass flux is then given by @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "we include photoionization as a means of excitation .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath108 the high opacities of @xmath6 in the accretion flow , stellar wind , and disk wind suggest that photoionization of helium from its ground state is likely . as a rough estimate of this rate",
    ", we note that a luminosity of @xmath109 in photon energies above @xmath110 , situated at the star , will produce at @xmath111 a @xmath1 photoionization rate of @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the power law index of the luminosity energy distribution . the greatest uncertainty in this rate , however , is the attenuation between the @xmath5 luminosity source and the local point considered , since the mean free path for an optical depth of unity at the ionization threshold is small , @xmath114 for a @xmath1 density of @xmath115 . to circumvent this problem we take @xmath116 as a parameter .",
    "the @xmath5 source will also ionize hydrogen from its ground state .",
    "the ratio @xmath117 ranges from 1.6 to 4 for @xmath118 between @xmath119 and @xmath120 if the luminosity source is not attenuated .",
    "the attenuations at the two thresholds can differ a lot and it is not clear which one is stronger . in most of the calculations we simply adopt @xmath121 , but will comment on the effects of differential attenuation .",
    "the condition of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , posed by the much more frequent occurrence of absorption features in @xmath6 than @xmath11 , will require a minimum @xmath116 at temperatures low enough that collisional excitation of @xmath1 is ineffective .",
    "it turns out that this limit is @xmath124 , so we will present results for @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the latter are much smaller than the unattenuated value given in the above equation for the hypothetical @xmath127 uv source .",
    "the stellar and veiling continua , which peak at optical wavelengths , are effective in ionizing the excited states of hydrogen and helium , as well as the ground state and excited states of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we assume a ctts of temperature @xmath128 and radius @xmath129 , and a veiling continuum given by a blackbody of temperature @xmath130 covering 3% of the stellar surface area . at 5000@xmath131",
    "the veiling continuum is then about as strong as the stellar continuum .    to summarize , the physical parameters in our local excitation model are primarily @xmath95 , @xmath98 , @xmath116 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the first three parameters are explored over broad enough ranges to cover all expected possibilities , such as line optical depths from @xmath132 to @xmath133 , and emissivity ratios from values smaller to values larger than corresponding observed line flux ratios . from these local excitation calculations line opacities and emissivity ratios",
    "are compared with observational data to delimit the requisite physical conditions .",
    "these results are fairly general and not strongly dependent on the kinematic structure .",
    "the line flux , on the other hand , is sensitive to the actual flow geometry . to illustrate the contrast between the stellar wind and the accretion flow",
    ", the line fluxes at @xmath134 are calculated for a stellar wind and an accretion flow reaching a speed of @xmath135 at @xmath47 and @xmath136 respectively .",
    "all these results aid in deciphering the observed line emission for their origin .",
    "cttss show many emission lines .",
    "the forbidden lines , such as @xmath21 \\lambda 6300 $ ] , @xmath137\\lambda 6731 $ ] , are likely formed at more than ten stellar radii away and not germane to probing the accretion flow and inner structures of disk and stellar winds . among the permitted lines , their profiles can be narrow ( @xmath138 ) , broad ( @xmath139 ) , or composite with a narrow component atop a broad component ( bek01 ) .",
    "the narrow lines / components are most likely formed at the sites where accreting streamlines impact the star , so their fluxes convey information on the summed area of such regions and the cooling history of the shocked gas . here",
    "we are concerned with the broad lines / components , as their widths indicate that they are likely formed as the gas accelerates either away from the star in a wind or towards the star in an accretion flow . in the optical and infrared domains",
    "these broad lines / components are , ordered roughly in decreasing emission strength , balmer lines , @xmath140 , and infrared triplet , ( @xmath6 , paschen and brackett lines , @xmath141 lines ) , and ( @xmath10 , @xmath142 , @xmath85 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 lines ) .",
    "several intrigues posed by the observed strengths of the above - mentioned lines indicate that an understanding of the ctts spectra must involve examining the @xmath146 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 line excitations altogether .",
    "one puzzle is the relative strength between the @xmath6 and @xmath11 emission .",
    "the observed @xmath6 spectra(efhk06 ) , with prominent absorption features , clearly demonstrate the high @xmath147 opacity , a consequence of the metastability of its lower state , @xmath148 . with @xmath149 at least as large as @xmath150 , as inferred from their relative propensity in showing an absorption ,",
    "a @xmath151 level population comparable to or larger than the @xmath152 level population is implied , and while @xmath11 competes against @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 for the de - excitation of @xmath156 @xmath6 is the sole permitted radiative decay channel for its upper level , @xmath157 . then the @xmath158 collisional excitation rate is larger than the hydrogen @xmath159 collisional excitation rate .",
    "thus collisional excitation should highly favor @xmath160 over @xmath11 emission , yet the two observed fluxes in emission are almost the same .    the second puzzle is the very strong @xmath3 infrared triplet emission in those cttss with strong @xmath6 and @xmath161 emission . the summed flux of the @xmath3 triplet rivals that of @xmath9 .",
    "collisional excitation of the triplet has the advantage that their upper state is only @xmath162 above the ground state , so the triplet can be strong , relative to @xmath9 , at low temperatures , despite the low @xmath163 abundance .",
    "however @xmath3 has an ionization potential of @xmath164 , much less than the @xmath1 ionization potential of @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , the lower state of the @xmath3 infrared triplet is metastable and only @xmath165 above the ground state , so it is well populated.ionization from this level takes @xmath166 , very slightly less than the energy of the @xmath167 photon . a strong buildup of the @xmath167 intensity , through radiative trapping , is required to sustain population in levels @xmath168 of hydrogen for strong balmer , paschen , and brackett line emission .",
    "it will at the same time ionize @xmath3 from its metastable state and reduce the @xmath3 fraction .",
    "thus the strong @xmath3 triplet emission appear incongruous with not only the @xmath6 and @xmath161 emission but also the hydrogen paschen and brackett line emission .",
    "in addition , the infrared triplet are very optically thick , as their fluxes are nearly equal despite a factor of @xmath169 difference among their oscillator strengths .",
    "yet they rarely show any absorption feature , even in cttss where their peak fluxes are only comparable to the continuum flux .",
    "in addition to calculating the @xmath146 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 line excitations , we will also include those of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath170 and @xmath171 lines are produced primarily through the @xmath172 fluorescence process ( bowen 1947 ) , in which the @xmath173 state is excited upon absorption of a @xmath172 photon by the ground state , and decays via emission of a @xmath174 , a @xmath171 , and a @xmath175 photon in succession .",
    "thus the @xmath85 flux is expected to correlate with the @xmath11 flux .",
    "the @xmath176 triplet , on the other hand , are formed via recombination and cascade and collisional excitation , in a fashion similar to the @xmath3 infrared triplet .",
    "so inclusion of the above @xmath2 lines will further check on the @xmath146 and @xmath3 excitation conditions .",
    "the @xmath4 atom , with an ionization potential of @xmath177 , is easily photoionized by the stellar and veiling continua , and requires a much lower temperature for collisional ionization than helium .",
    "the often appearance of absorption in the @xmath4 doublet , in conjunction with absorption in @xmath178 , then sheds light on the pertinent physical conditions .",
    "we will not examine the @xmath141 and @xmath145 lines here .",
    "there are many of them , from infrared to uv wavelengths .",
    "their summed emission strength may even exceed that of the hydrogen lines , so they are an important heat sink , and must be counted in deriving the total energy generation rate . with ionization potentials of @xmath179 and @xmath180 for @xmath145 and @xmath141 respectively , the @xmath145 to @xmath141 flux ratio will also provide a constraint on the ionization condition .",
    "a proper study of the @xmath145 and @xmath141 line excitations , however , needs good observational data on the fluxes of the many @xmath5 multiplets , which are not presently available .",

    "[ [ hi ] ] hi ~~    in modelling the hydrogen atom we assume that the level population among degenerate energy states are thermally distributed , and use 15 distinct energy levels , labelled @xmath183 .",
    "limiting the hydrogen atom to a fixed number of levels can be questionable .",
    "this is because the @xmath184 collisional rate coefficient , @xmath185 , increases while the spontaneous emission rate of level @xmath186 , @xmath187 , decreases as @xmath186 increases , so once the electron density @xmath188 exceeds the value @xmath189 , @xmath190 for @xmath191 , or an even lesser value if some of the radiative transitions are optically thick , successive collisional excitations to higher levels , effectively leading to ionization , provide the quickest route of depopulating level @xmath186 . ignoring this population transfer to higher levels produces error in the population of not only level @xmath186 , but also lower levels , since there is less population return to the lower levels from collisional and radiative de - excitations of upper levels .",
    "the proper number of levels to use is clearly dependent on @xmath188 , which in turn is dependent on @xmath98 , @xmath95 , and @xmath192 . to ensure that @xmath193 levels are adequate over our explored density range",

    "our hei model atom consists of the 19 lowest energy states .",
    "the spin of the two electrons in each state can add up to @xmath83 or @xmath77 , so the 19 states can be separated , according to the degeneracies of the total spin , into a ladder of triplets and one of singlets , since radiative transitions across the ladders are forbidden by the electric - dipole selection rules .",
    "for the same energy quantum number @xmath186 the angular momentum states @xmath210 , unlike those in the case of @xmath146 , are separated in energy by many thermal doppler widths , so we treat them as distinct energy levels .",

    "the latter means of depleting @xmath217 photons is particularly important once @xmath218 becomes large . to determine its rate of depopulating @xmath216",

    "the rate of hydrogen ionization by @xmath217 photons is then less than @xmath232 , which is less than the rate of continuum photoionization of hydrogen , @xmath233",
    ". if thermal motion is the energy source for helium excitation , then collisional excitation and ionization are much more efficient for hydrogen than for helium .",

    "[ [ oi ] ] oi ~~    figure 3 shows a schematic of the energy levels of @xmath2 pertinent to our calculations and the important radiative transitions .",

    "the @xmath174 photon emissivity ( @xmath254 ) resulting from this @xmath172 fluorescence process ( bowen 1947 ) depends on the @xmath172 intensity and the probability that @xmath247 decays via emission of a @xmath174 photon . because @xmath172 is expected to be very optically thick , we assume its specific intensity to be given by the blackbody value at the hydrogen @xmath255 excitation temperature , i. e. , @xmath256 , where @xmath257 and @xmath258 are the hydrogen @xmath259 and @xmath83 level population respectively . for the probability of @xmath174 emission , we consider first the upper level @xmath249 .",
    "it can decay to all three fine - structure levels of the ground state as well as to @xmath260 , so the probability of @xmath174 emission upon absorption of a @xmath172 photon through the @xmath261 transition is @xmath262 where @xmath33 signifies the spontaneous emission rate and @xmath34 the escape probability .",
    "the @xmath263 escape probability equals 1 , even though the transition is most likely very optically thick , because the @xmath172 opacity is even larger , so the emitted @xmath264 photon will not be absorbed by @xmath2 .",
    "the probabilities of @xmath174 emission via @xmath172 absorptions through the @xmath265 and @xmath266 transitions can be written out analogously .",

    "the absorption of @xmath172 photons by @xmath2 has the corollary effect of depopulating the @xmath276 population .",
    "we have included this process in the hydrogen excitation calculations , but only with the simple expression enumerated above for the most common situation in order to avoid an iterative procedure involving @xmath146 and @xmath2 calculations .",
    "with @xmath277 it is readily seen from the above expression for @xmath274 that the corresponding @xmath259 de - excitation rate is @xmath278 .",
    "while it can rival @xmath172 escape , it is much weaker than @xmath9 escape at low densities and collisional de - excitation at high densities , so the actual effect on the hydrogen level population is insignificant .",
    "the @xmath172 fluorescence process enhances not only @xmath174 emission but , through the subsequent radiative cascade back to the ground state , also @xmath171 and @xmath175 emission .",
    "the resulting @xmath279 flux ratio is then just the ratio of the photon energies or @xmath280 .",
    "however , collisional excitation favors @xmath171 over @xmath174 emission , so a smaller observed flux ratio is a measure of the relative contribution between the two processes .",
    "absorption in @xmath171 is occasionally seen .",
    "it is facilitated by the population built up in @xmath281 through @xmath172 fluorescence and sustained via radiative trapping of @xmath175 photons .",
    "the @xmath282 triplet emission is produced from recombination and cascade , and collisional excitation .",
    "the metastable nature of the lower level @xmath283 , whose spontaneous emission rate is only @xmath284 , sustains a comparatively large population in that level and enhances the collisional pathway of triplet emission .",
    "it likewise helps to bring about absorption of the stellar and veiling continua through the larger line opacity .    in performing the @xmath2 excitation calculations we assume that the fine - structure states are populated in proportion to their degeneracies , and use a single level to represent them .",
    "this simplification is appropriate when the transitions between those fine - structure states and another level are separated in energy by about one thermal doppler width or less .",
    "when this is not the case , as for the @xmath285 or @xmath286 transitions , the simplified procedure works fine when the transitions are optically thin but , when they are optically thick , does not take into account the availability of several radiative channels for de - excitation .",
    "also , when collisional de - excitation dominates over radiative de - excitation , it underestimates the total emitted flux by a factor equal to the number of distinct ( doppler - width separated ) lines .",
    "to remedy this situation , we re - define the line optical depth as the usual definition divided by the above factor .",
    "it represents a sort of average of the optical depths of the separate lines .",
    "for example , in our procedure this optical depth between @xmath242 and @xmath281 , @xmath287 , equals 0.6 , 1.0 , and 3.0 of @xmath288 , @xmath289 , and @xmath290 respectively .",
    "this modification also produces the correct total emitted flux when the distinct lines are all optically thin and when they all have optical depths greater than @xmath291 .",
    "there may be a small error in the level population when some of the line optical depths lie between 0.5 and 2 , but this regime occupies a very narrow strip of our explored density range , and we are not overly concerned .",
    "@xmath3 , with an ionization potential of @xmath292 , can be ionized quite readily by even the veiling continuum if the latter has an energy distribution that extends towards the far @xmath5 like a blackbody .",
    "for example , with our adopted veiling continuum of temperature @xmath130 and area covering factor of @xmath293 , the photoionization rate of the @xmath294 ground state at @xmath111 is @xmath295 , higher than our assumed @xmath5 continuum photoionization rate , which is @xmath296 .",
    "moreover , the excited state @xmath297 , the lower state of the @xmath298 triplet , is metastable , with an einstein a rate of only @xmath299 , so it is most likely populated in thermal equilibrium with the ground state .",
    "its lower ionization potential and larger photoionization cross - section produce an even stronger ionization rate , @xmath300 with our adopted veiling continuum .",
    "as an example , if the @xmath301 excitation temperature is @xmath302 , ionization of @xmath3 from @xmath297 is 30 times that from @xmath294 . also ,",
    "as noted in the beginning of  3 , the @xmath297 ionization potential is very slightly less than the @xmath167 photon energy .",
    "this ionization rate by @xmath167 photons ( @xmath225 ) is ( cf . ",

    "the hydrogen @xmath238 to @xmath83 population ratio , @xmath305 , has a value often larger than @xmath306 , that needed for @xmath307 to equal @xmath308 , the @xmath297 photoionization rate by the veiling continuum .",
    "thus , @xmath167 photons constitute an even more potent source of @xmath3 ionization .",

    "we assume the fine - structure states to be populated in proportion to their degeneracies and re - define the line optical depth to reflect the number of distinct lines .",
    "the observed line fluxes indicate that all five lines are very optically thick , so our simplified procedure of lumping into one single level the population in all associated fine - structure states is fine .",
    "our model @xmath4 atom consists of just the ground level @xmath315 and an excited level comprising the two fine - structure states of @xmath316 , whose radiative decays give rise to the well known @xmath317 doublet .",
    "the lower state of the doublet being the ground state helps to bring about strong absorption and/or emission in the doublet . on the other hand @xmath4 , with an ionization potential of only @xmath177 , is easily photoionized or collisionally ionized from the ground level , and",
    "even more so from the excited level , so the sodium ionization structure is key .",
    "the local excitation calculations can produce line opacities and emissivities over an extensive parameter space of physical conditions , but need information from observational data to demarcate the pertinent regions .",

    "thus , above this temperature @xmath1(@xmath146 ) photoionization at the assumed strength is less effective than collisional excitation .",
    "the fairly large separation between the @xmath349 and @xmath350 contours in @xmath98 space at @xmath361 indicates that the condition of @xmath362 can be readily produced by collisional excitations alone . as the effectiveness of @xmath1",

    "it is interesting that in this temperature range comparing between the @xmath349 and @xmath350 contours in the @xmath365 case shows that a larger ( @xmath116 , @xmath98 ) parameter space is again available to meet the @xmath362 condition .",
    "thus , at @xmath371 a @xmath116 of @xmath126 is more than sufficient .",
    "the above rather surprising result is caused by the @xmath6 lower level being extremely metastable , making spontaneous decay ineffective in comparison with depopulation via collisions with electrons for @xmath372 .",
    "as mentioned in  3.2 , collisional excitation to the singlet @xmath235 is more important than direct collisional deexcitation to the ground state .",
    "the rate of this depopulation route is then @xmath373 and the @xmath6 optical depth , in the limit when photoionization dominates over collisional excitation , can be expressed as @xmath374 as @xmath95 decreases , both @xmath375 and @xmath376 increase while @xmath377 decreases , and they work in concert to make @xmath364 larger , thereby enabling a given optical depth to be obtained at a lower @xmath98 , hence the reversal of the @xmath349 contour direction seen distinctly in the bottom panel of figure 4 .",
    "an illustration of how the electron fraction @xmath377 depends on the physical parameters will help understand the behaviors of the optical depth contours as well as results presented later .",

    "the quantitative values of @xmath377 make it easy to see the behavior of the @xmath364 contours . at @xmath365",
    "the @xmath349 contour near @xmath357 lies at @xmath383 . from figure 5(bottom panel ) it is seen that there @xmath377 decreases rapidly with @xmath95 decreasing from @xmath384 to @xmath385 .",
    "this sharp decrease is largely responsible for the switchback of the @xmath349 contour toward a lower @xmath98 .",
    "the same figure also helps to explain the large separation between the @xmath349 and @xmath348 contours seen at @xmath365 and @xmath386 .",
    "this arises because in that temperature range increasing @xmath98 above @xmath387 leads to @xmath377 increasing also , which counteracts the effect of @xmath375 increasing in the expression for @xmath364 . as a result @xmath364 barely changes for @xmath388 .",
    "this large separation between the @xmath349 and 3.16 contours is not seen in the @xmath354 case because in the same temperature range the @xmath389 contour there lies at @xmath390 .    at @xmath382",
    "the @xmath364 contours for the two @xmath116s are not far apart .",
    "this insensitivity of @xmath363 to decreasing @xmath116 at low temperatures may explain why @xmath6 shows such a penchant for absorption .",
    "seen in @xmath6 are not only the broad blue and red absorptions that arise from kinematic regions close to the star , but also the narrow , sharp blue absorption indicative of a disk wind , and the central absorption that has been suggested as arising from a disk corona even farther away from the star ( kwan 1997 ) . presumably the ionization sources are located close to the star and , even if intervening attenuation is ignored , @xmath116 will decrease with distance .",
    "it turns out that the density required to produce a @xmath364 of unity is not prohibitive . to see this",
    ", we find that if @xmath188 is supplied through @xmath5 photoionization of hydrogen , as likely at @xmath391 , then @xmath392 and @xmath393 thus @xmath364 is more sensitive to @xmath95 for @xmath382 than to @xmath116",
    ". also @xmath394 can be quite large if the @xmath5 continuum near the hydrogen ionization threshold is attenuated more severely by intervening hydrogen . in the limit that both helium and hydrogen are ionized by photons with energies",
    "@xmath395 @xmath394 is @xmath396 , which is a factor of 12 larger than the earlier assumed value of 0.5 .",
    "this means that @xmath116 can be smaller than @xmath126 by a factor of 12 and still produce at @xmath397 a @xmath364 of one with @xmath398 .",
    "even lower values of @xmath116 are possible if @xmath95 is lower .",
    "the temperature at which direct collisional de - excitation of @xmath234 occurs as rapidly as the postulated de - population route is @xmath399 , so @xmath116 can be smaller by another factor of @xmath400 when direct collisional de - excitation dominates .    in figure 4",
    "the pair of contours for each line purports to illustrate its sensitivity to varying @xmath98 .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 optical depths increase faster than linearly with increasing @xmath98 .",
    "this is because the population in each of their lower level is sustained via radiative trapping , so for @xmath9 , for example , @xmath401 .",
    "the @xmath6 optical depth , by comparison , is less responsive to increasing @xmath98 , particularly at @xmath95 between @xmath15 and @xmath357 when @xmath365 , as discussed earlier .",
    "the @xmath9 contours are dependent on @xmath192 over its explored range only at @xmath369 , as mentioned before , and then only weakly so .",
    "the @xmath11 contours are more sensitive because the @xmath259 population relies on the @xmath238 population being built up first . above @xmath357 the hydrogen contours move towards lower densities with increasing temperature , owing to the stronger collisional excitations from the ground level , but then reverse direction at @xmath402 .",
    "this reversal is caused by the increase in collisional ionizations which rapidly reduces the hydrogen neutral fraction .",
    "figure 6 shows the contours @xmath403 , @xmath404 , @xmath405 , @xmath406 , and @xmath407 .",
    "the @xmath350 contour is also re - plotted for comparison . for the line optical depth that represents a multiplet with well separated components ( in doppler widths )",
    ", it needs be mentioned that , with our single level stand - in , the plotted optical depth is a rough average of the individual component optical depths . to be specific ,",
    "@xmath408 the wavelength used to denote the @xmath3 infrared triplet as a group is the same as that of one member because that particular member is used to produce observed line ratios for comparison with model results .",
    "a similar denotation is not adopted for the @xmath144 triplet because its three members are separated by only @xmath409 and all are seen within one line profile , so their total flux is used .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 optical depth contours exhibit little difference between the two @xmath5 ionization fluxes , as the @xmath3 and @xmath4 fractions depend only indirectly on the postulated @xmath5 continuum through the resulting @xmath188 that affects the recombination rate and , in the case of @xmath3 , also through the hydrogen @xmath305 ratio that affects the @xmath167 photoionization rate .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 contours also respond similarly to @xmath95 increasing from @xmath410 , owing to their common susceptibility to collisional ionization .",
    "the @xmath2 ionization structure is tied to hydrogen s via charge exchange , so the @xmath2 optical depth contours at @xmath275 respond to varying @xmath192 in much the same way as the hydrogen optical depth contours . above @xmath411",
    "the @xmath412 contour stays at nearly the same @xmath98 while the @xmath413 contour moves towards much higher densities .",
    "this is due to the lower state of @xmath144 being metastable while that of @xmath85 decaying rapidly with @xmath414 decreasing with increasing temperature .",
    "both figures 4 and 6 refer to local excitation calculations at @xmath47 , a location appropriate for either a stellar wind or the farther portion of an accretion flow .",
    "figure 7 shows similar optical depth contours for @xmath354 , and @xmath415 to evaluate the dependence on position .",
    "comparing it with figures 4 and 6(top panels ) indicates that the differences are quite small . for fixed values of @xmath98 and @xmath95 ,",
    "the @xmath146 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 optical depths are somewhat smaller at @xmath415 because of the factor @xmath416 in the opacity expression , hence their contours are displaced towards higher densities , with the amounts dependent on the responses of the line optical depths to increasing @xmath98 .",
    "for the @xmath4 and @xmath3 optical depths , there is the additional effect of a stronger stellar and veiling continuum flux at @xmath415 , which increases the photoionization rate and leads also to a displacement of their contours towards higher densities . from figures 4 , 6 and 7",
    "we can infer that the line optical depths and , by analogy , line emissivity ratios , which will be discussed in the next section , are much more dependent on @xmath98 , @xmath95 , and @xmath116 than on @xmath41 .      with in mind the observed propensities of the various lines in showing an absorption , we are in a position to draw the following conclusions from the model results presented in this section .",
    "@xmath5 photoionization is necessary to produce the broad red and blue absorptions seen in @xmath6 because both gases have a temperature @xmath417 or less .",
    "the most direct argument comes from the observed red absorptions .",
    "they are seen in @xmath6 and @xmath418 frequently , and @xmath11 occasionally . for @xmath4 absorption to be more prevalent than @xmath11 absorption the temperature needs to be less than @xmath357 , as a comparison between the @xmath11 and @xmath4 optical depth contours indicates . then for @xmath6 absorption to be as prevalent as @xmath4 absorption at @xmath369 , @xmath5 continuum photoionization is paramount . in the next two sections one result drawn from the analyses will be that the gas producing the broad blue absorption has a temperature not higher than @xmath417 , which is also the condition needed for a broad blue absorption to be present in @xmath418 but not @xmath11 .",
    "in the temperature range of @xmath369 we can compare the observed order of lines in their propensity of showing a red absorption to the order gleaned from the model results by judging the available volume in ( @xmath419 ) space where the line optical depth exceeds 0.1 as reflecting the propensity .",
    "the latter decreases roughly in the order of @xmath6 , balmer lines , @xmath420 , @xmath421 , paschen lines , @xmath422 , @xmath85 , @xmath144 , and @xmath10 .",
    "it needs to be noted that the range in @xmath116 is specifically chosen to place @xmath6 close to the top of the order , so a @xmath423 or higher is needed . with in mind the explanation given in  4 regarding the lack of red absorptions in @xmath422 , this order is close to that observed except for the position of @xmath144 .",
    "this line , however , is a triplet and , with its members separated by only @xmath409 , is more effective than a single line in producing an absorption because of its greater velocity coverage , and this interesting property of @xmath176 more than compensates for its smaller optical depth in relation to @xmath85 .",
    "the occasional presence of red absorptions in @xmath424 and @xmath10 also indicates a density @xmath425 or higher for the red absorption gas .",
    "the density of the gas producing the broad blue absorption is much lower than that of the accretion flow .",
    "this is obvious if the two flows have similar temperatures over most of their volumes , since @xmath23 , @xmath11 , and @xmath426 show red absorptions but almost never blue absorptions . but even if that were not the case , the absence of @xmath23 and @xmath11 blue absorptions would by themselves require , at @xmath28 , @xmath427 .",
    "a rough estimate , based on figures 4 , 6 , and 7 , of the typical gas density occupying the bulk of the stellar wind and accretion flow is @xmath428 and @xmath14 respectively . the corresponding mass flux , however , can be quite similar , as the product of the factors @xmath429 and @xmath90 is likely @xmath430 to @xmath431 times larger for the stellar wind",
    ".    \\4 . when @xmath364 is @xmath26 the @xmath9 optical depth is close to or higher than 1 for @xmath432 and @xmath433 or less ( cf .",
    "thus we expect @xmath9 to be as effective as @xmath6 in absorbing the stellar and veiling continua .",
    "the rarer occurrence of broad blue or red absorption in @xmath9 is attributed to the strength of the @xmath9 emission , which is considerably greater than the continuum level .",
    "line ratios are very good diagnostics of physical conditions because while the observed flux of a line depends on the local line emissivity and the volume of emission , the flux ratio of two lines bypasses to a large extent the effect of emission volume and probes directly the local physical conditions . here",
    "we examine several pairs of line ratios that are particularly illuminating in this regard .",
    "the first pair is @xmath434 and @xmath435 .",
    "the nature of @xmath6 being the only allowed radiative transition following the @xmath161 transition means that emission of a @xmath161 photon is usually followed by emission of a @xmath147 photon , but not vice versa , while collisional excitation from @xmath234 strongly favors @xmath147 emission because of both the lower excitation energy and the larger collisional cross - section .",
    "the @xmath331 ratio is then expected to be small at low densities .",
    "it will rise only when the @xmath147 transition becomes sufficiently optically thick that at the same time collisional de - excitation becomes competitive with @xmath147 escape , population is built up into @xmath436 from where collisional excitation of @xmath161 is more effective .",
    "it is therefore very sensitive to density and , with @xmath437 being the strongest observed helium lines , clearly the most important diagnostic of physical conditions giving rise to helium emission . to find out how the hydrogen emission fare in the same conditions , we want to contrast @xmath331 against a ratio involving a hydrogen line and a helium line .",
    "the @xmath435 ratio is the most logical choice since , as mentioned in  3 , its observed value of close to unity appears incongruous with their perceived opacities .",
    "it also has the advantage of being quite easily and accurately measured because both lines occur in the same echelle order .",
    "it is possible and highly probable that hydrogen emission arise from more than one kinematic region , because the physical conditions conducive to strong hydrogen emission are likely to be more wide - ranging than those conducive to either strong helium or @xmath3 emission .",
    "ratios involving only hydrogen lines are therefore useful to ascertain the relevant region in the ( @xmath438 ) parameter space .",
    "we will examine first @xmath439 and @xmath440 in tandem to see , for a given @xmath192 , how they depend on @xmath98 and @xmath95 , and correlate with each other .",
    "the @xmath441 ratio is interesting because there is a substantial amount of recent data pointing to a fairly uniform but somewhat surprising value ( bary et al .",
    "2008 ) , while @xmath440 involves both the strongest optical line observed and the line selected earlier to compare with @xmath6 .",
    "these two ratios involve hydrogen levels up to @xmath156 .",
    "we will also compare @xmath318 with observed ratios for @xmath320 up to 12 so the observed hydrogen emission from high @xmath186 levels are also brought into play .",
    "the next two pairs of ratios focus on the @xmath3 infrared triplet emission in relation to hydrogen and oxygen emission .",
    "we examine first @xmath442 and @xmath443 , and then @xmath444 and @xmath445 .",
    "the latter pair has the added bonus that the three wavelengths involved are in close proximity , so the observed ratios have less uncertainties .    in the following three subsections we study in order the above mentioned line ratios . in each subsection",
    "we present first the results of the model calculations and then compare them with observations to demarcate the prevailing physical conditions .",
    "figure 8 shows how @xmath331 and @xmath446 depend on @xmath98 ( top panel ) or line optical depth ( bottom panel ) for @xmath47 , @xmath354 , and various temperatures . in this and subsequent figures we use different line types to denote different temperatures .",
    "each of six line types signifies the same temperature in all the relevant figures , but a seventh line type , dot - long dash , can signify a different temperature in a different figure in order to allow for more flexibility in the selection of appropriate temperatures to illustrate .",
    "table 1 lists the designations between line types and temperatures , and serves as a reference .",
    "when a model track in a figure has space nearby its temperature ( in unit of @xmath357 ) is marked for ready identification .",
    "the most important physical process influencing the @xmath322 ratio is collisions with electrons .",
    "the summed rate of @xmath447 and @xmath448 collisions , which lead to @xmath10 emission , is much weaker than the summed rate of collisions from @xmath234 that lead to @xmath6 emission . in the regime",
    "when level de - excitation is dominated by radiative decay , the @xmath331 ratio resulting from collisional excitations ranges from @xmath449 at @xmath397 to @xmath450 at @xmath451 .",
    "the ratio resulting from recombination and cascade is higher .",
    "when the cascade ends at @xmath234 roughly two @xmath147 photons are produced for each @xmath161 photon .",
    "however , @xmath234 de - excites to the ground level primarily through collisions , and the ratio of @xmath452 to @xmath453 collisional rate gives the number of additional @xmath147 photons emitted before each de - excitation of @xmath234 .",
    "this number is @xmath454 , @xmath455 , and @xmath456 at @xmath457 , @xmath384 , and @xmath458 respectively .",
    "thus , even if helium excitation were all caused by @xmath5 photoionization of the ground state , the @xmath459 ratio would only be @xmath460 , @xmath461 , and @xmath462 at @xmath457 , @xmath384 , and @xmath458 respectively .",
    "a larger ratio can only be obtained in the regime when the @xmath6 optical depth is sufficiently high that collisional de - excitation begins to rival @xmath147 escape and effectively retards the growth of the @xmath6 flux .",
    "the detailed calculations bear out the above analysis . in figure",
    "8 results for @xmath463 are shown because those for @xmath464 and @xmath458 are almost the same . at low densities",
    "@xmath331 is very small because of the prominent contribution to the @xmath6 emissivity from stimulated absorption of the stellar and veiling continua . with increasing @xmath98 @xmath322",
    "roughly levels off at a value determined by the relative contribution between collisional excitation and recombination and cascade to the line emissivity . then , depending on @xmath95 , @xmath331 begins to rise sharply when @xmath465 exceeds between @xmath83 and @xmath169 while @xmath364 is between @xmath430 and @xmath466 .",
    "the actual criterion for collisional quenching of @xmath6 emission is @xmath467 , and it is seen from figure 8 that the density @xmath98 needed to meet this criterion drops from @xmath18 at @xmath397 to @xmath468 at @xmath451 .    turning to @xmath435 , it is seen that its dependences on @xmath98 and @xmath95 are drastically different . at a given temperature @xmath435 peaks at a lower @xmath98 than that marking the sharp rise of @xmath331 . over the range of @xmath98 explored , @xmath435 is strongest at @xmath95 between @xmath15 and @xmath357 and weakest at @xmath469 , while it is the exact opposite for @xmath331 .",
    "thus these two ratios anti - correlate .",
    "this relationship is readily understood when examined with the temperature range separated into two regimes .    at @xmath470",
    "the @xmath6 emissivity is clearly very sensitive to temperature since the @xmath471 collisional excitation rate , which supplements @xmath5 photoionization in populating @xmath234 , and collisional excitation of @xmath6 from @xmath234 are both strongly dependent on temperature .",
    "the @xmath10 emissivity is even more responsive to increasing temperature because of both a higher excitation energy from @xmath234 and its reliance also on the build up of the @xmath234 population .",
    "consequently the @xmath331 ratio increases with increasing @xmath95 from @xmath384 to @xmath458 .",
    "it does not change much with @xmath95 between @xmath472 and @xmath97 because the reduction of @xmath375 due to ionization begins to take effect .",
    "the @xmath11 emissivity also benefits from the higher collisional excitation rate when @xmath95 increases from @xmath357 , but the concurrent decreases in @xmath473 ( due to ionization ) and @xmath167 opacity retard the build up of population into the excited levels .",
    "a confirmation of this very different behavior of the excited state population between @xmath146 and @xmath1 can be seen from figure 4 , since the @xmath465 and @xmath370 contours are essentially contours of the population in @xmath474 ( lower state of the @xmath10 transition ) , @xmath475 , and @xmath276 , @xmath257 , respectively . as @xmath95 increases above @xmath357 , the @xmath475 contour shifts towards decreasing @xmath98 , indicating an increasing @xmath476 ratio at a fixed @xmath98 , and then hardly shifts between @xmath477 and @xmath97 , while the @xmath257 contour shifts very little between @xmath478 and @xmath202 , but then shifts towards increasing @xmath98 with further increase in @xmath95 .",
    "this contrasting behavior accounts for @xmath435 decreasing while @xmath331 increases with @xmath95 increasing above @xmath357 .",
    "as @xmath95 decreases from @xmath357 the ionization of hydrogen begins to rely more on @xmath5 photoionization and the electron fraction @xmath377 decreases with decreasing @xmath95 ( cf .",
    "fig . 5 ) . both decreases in @xmath377 and",
    "@xmath95 reduce the @xmath479 de - excitation rate , as alluded to earlier in  5.1 , and the consequent higher @xmath234 population counteract the decrease in the @xmath480 collisional excitation rate . as a result the @xmath6 emissivity does not decrease as rapidly with decreasing temperature as the @xmath11 emissivity , and @xmath435 drops .    at",
    "a given temperature @xmath435 rises rapidly as @xmath98 increases from @xmath359 , peaks at an @xmath98 between @xmath481 and @xmath14 , and then falls .",
    "the rapid rise is related to the high sensitivity to @xmath98 of the hydrogen population build up into upper levels , relying on radiative trapping of successive @xmath482 transitions .",
    "the rise to the peak corresponds to @xmath370 increasing from less than @xmath83 to a value between @xmath483 and @xmath484 .",
    "further increase in @xmath370 reduces the photon escape probability and slows the growth of @xmath11 emissivity , leading to a falling @xmath485 ratio .",
    "curbing of @xmath11 emissivity occurs before that of @xmath6 emissivity because @xmath486 .    the earlier discussion in  5.1 on how @xmath116 affects the @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath146 optical depth contours also hints at the corresponding responses of the @xmath331 and @xmath435 ratios , which are shown in figure 9 for @xmath365 .",
    "as expected , @xmath331 is affected little and then only at @xmath487 , since both line emissivities , like the line optical depths , respond similarly to varying @xmath116 , while @xmath435 clearly peaks higher at @xmath488 , the temperature range over which the @xmath479 population is most susceptible to @xmath116 .",
    "the basic contrast between the two ratios in their dependences on @xmath98 and @xmath95 , however , remains the same .",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath331 and @xmath435 is more conspicuous when the two ratios are plotted against each other , as shown in figure 10 . the logarithmic scale is used for greater clarity of the model tracks which will be bunched towards the @xmath489 or @xmath490 axis in a linear plot .",
    "@xmath331 is clearly high when @xmath446 is low , and vice versa .",
    "many of the observed values that are marked lie at positions very much off the tracks that model results produce as @xmath98 increases at a fixed @xmath95 .",
    "the track closest to them is generated at @xmath397 , and it is more easily seen from figure 8 that @xmath331 is slightly higher than @xmath92 over the range @xmath491 when @xmath435 drops from @xmath492 to @xmath493 .",
    "several arguments , however , point to a temperature of the emitting gas much higher than @xmath410 .",
    "they are based on ratios of hydrogen lines and on line fluxes , and will be propounded when the pertinent results are presented . the remaining way to explain the observed ratios is for @xmath10 and @xmath11 emission to arise from two different locales , e. g. , a region of @xmath451 for the former and one of @xmath411 for the latter .",
    "the @xmath494 and @xmath329 ratios in their respective locales are then actually higher than the observed ratios since both locales will produce @xmath6 emission efficiently .",
    "for example , figure 8 shows that at @xmath451 @xmath435 is less than @xmath495 for @xmath496 , while at @xmath411 @xmath322 is less than @xmath497 for @xmath498 .",
    "then , if the observed @xmath6 emission is contributed equally by each locale , to produce observed @xmath331 and @xmath499 ratios of @xmath500 and @xmath501 respectively , the @xmath502 ( @xmath357 ) locale will need to produce a @xmath322 ( @xmath435 ) ratio of @xmath493 ( @xmath503 ) .",
    "in a way the model results confirm the perceived enigma mentioned in  3 concerning @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "they demonstrate that a common set of physical conditions , a natural and reasonable premise implicit in formulating the enigma , can not produce at the same time the @xmath6 and @xmath11 emission strengths and their relative opacities as suggested by their propensities in showing an absorption .",
    "we draw the following conclusions concerning the observed strong @xmath504 and @xmath11 emission .",
    "\\1 . @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath11 emission do not arise from the same locale .",
    "in particular , the gas emitting @xmath10 has a temperature close to @xmath458 while that emitting @xmath11 has a temperature close to @xmath357 .",
    "the gas producing the @xmath505 emission is very optically thick in those lines .",
    "thus @xmath465 needs to exceed @xmath430 for @xmath331 to exceed 0.3 ( cf .",
    "8 & 9 left bottom panel ) .",
    "the gas producing the @xmath6 blue absorption , which needs to be optically thin in @xmath10 to avoid a @xmath10 blue absorption , is then distinct from the gas producing the @xmath1 emission .",
    "this does not exclude the emission to arise from a stellar wind .",
    "it only stipulates that the emitting regions fill a sufficiently small volume of the wind that their summed surface area with a particular projected @xmath17 subtends a small solid angle .",
    "the gas producing the red absorption is not producing the @xmath506 emission . even though @xmath10 shows a red absorption in a few cttss , indicating in those objects an optical thickness that fulfills one requirement for strong emission , the deduced temperature of less than @xmath357 for that gas ( cf .",
    " 5.2 ) does not meet the temperature requirement .",
    "the hydrogen line ratios are expected to correlate with one another , owing to the ladder - like energy level structure and very similar de - excitation pathways for each excited level .",
    "figure 11 shows how @xmath441 and @xmath440 relate to @xmath98 and @xmath95 for @xmath47 and @xmath507 .",
    "we use the case of @xmath411 to illustrate the @xmath440 dependence on @xmath98 . as @xmath98 increases from @xmath115",
    ", @xmath508 falls because of the strong contribution to the @xmath9 emissivity from stimulated absorption of the stellar and veiling continua .",
    "this contribution diminishes when @xmath150 begins to exceed unity beyond @xmath509 , whereupon @xmath508 increases with increasing @xmath98 .",
    "the initial rise from @xmath510 to @xmath511 is due to the continual contribution of @xmath11 stimulated absorption . at @xmath512",
    "collisional excitation of @xmath9 also becomes important , and population is rapidly built up into @xmath513 levels .",
    "the steeper response of the @xmath156 population to @xmath98 increasing from @xmath514 to @xmath515 produces the rise of @xmath440 from @xmath516 to @xmath497 .",
    "the further rise of @xmath440 as @xmath98 exceeds @xmath517 is caused by collisional de - excitation rivalling @xmath9 escape , effectively stunting @xmath9 emissivity growth .",
    "as seen from the accompanying plot with @xmath370 as the abscissa the important rise of @xmath440 from @xmath518 begins at @xmath519 .",
    "the @xmath441 ratio also increases from @xmath520 at about the same @xmath370 .",

    "the behavior of @xmath441 at @xmath382 is actually more similar to those at higher temperatures , only that the highest @xmath370 reached is much smaller .",
    "this stronger similarity is because , at the same @xmath370 , the comparison between the rates of photon escape , @xmath541 , and collisional de - excitation is almost independent of temperature .",

    "they , however , are sensitive to density . from figure 11",
    "it is seen that the dependence of @xmath441 on @xmath98 is strong and quite similar for @xmath552 , but changes rapidly as @xmath95 decreases from @xmath553 .",
    "for example , to obtain @xmath554 the density needed at @xmath382 is higher than that needed at @xmath555 by a factor @xmath556 .    the data sample of bary et al .",

    "in general , as @xmath98 increases above @xmath567 , @xmath318 ( @xmath568 ) increases , with the higher @xmath320 increasing more .",
    "although there is no single @xmath98 that produces an excellent match to data , the range in @xmath98 generating @xmath569 ratios that bracket the data is quite small , of order less than a factor of @xmath169 .",
    "this range is almost the same for @xmath555 , being @xmath570 , while that for @xmath571 is @xmath572 .",

    "@xmath11 is optically thick in the hydrogen emission region .",

    "the more limited and extreme range on @xmath98 needed to produce @xmath586 at @xmath587 is one argument .",
    "another is the difficulty in matching the observed @xmath435 ratio . as seen from figure 8",

    "this match - up is better in the case of @xmath365 ( cf .",
    "9 ) , but then @xmath441 is only @xmath501 at @xmath590 .",
    "the density in the hydrogen emission region is centered around @xmath425 if @xmath591 , and around @xmath592 if @xmath382 , in order to produce the observed @xmath318 , @xmath593 , ratios .",
    "we compare the @xmath3 infrared triplet to @xmath11 for its being a fairly strong hydrogen line not too far away in wavelength , and to @xmath85 for its tie to the hydrogen excitation through @xmath172 fluorescence and its close proximity in wavelength .",
    "figure 15 shows the dependences of @xmath332 and @xmath443 on @xmath98 and @xmath370 for @xmath47 , @xmath595 and seven temperatures .",
    "figure 16 is analogous , but with @xmath596 versus @xmath98 and @xmath597 , and @xmath445 versus @xmath98 and @xmath412 .",
    "because of our single level representation of multiple fine - structure levels , we divide the emissivity from our model @xmath3 ion by three , thereby implicitly assuming that all three components of the triplet are optically thick , a reasonable assertion as all three components have nearly identical fluxes and profiles .",
    "our model @xmath597 is five times the optical depth of the component with the weakest oscillator strength ( cf .",
    " 5.1 ) , so the @xmath3 infrared emission requires @xmath598 to exceed ten .",
    "our @xmath144 line also represents a triplet , but the whole emissivity is employed here since the observed flux also comprises contributions from all three components .",
    "figure 15 shows that @xmath443 rises continually to beyond unity as @xmath98 increases .",
    "this is largely because the much lower @xmath424 optical depth ( cf .",
    "6 ) keeps @xmath171 escape more effective than collisional de - excitation .",
    "the dependence of @xmath443 on temperature depends slightly on @xmath98 . at",
    "@xmath599 @xmath443 increases as @xmath95 increases from @xmath410 , peaks at @xmath600 and then drops with further increase in @xmath95 .",
    "this behavior can be seen from the dependences of the @xmath85 emissivity , @xmath601 , and the @xmath11 emissivity , @xmath602 , on the hydrogen level population .",
    "thus @xmath443 is @xmath603 .",
    "as @xmath95 increases from @xmath410 at a fixed @xmath98 , @xmath604 always decreases , while @xmath257 first increases but then decreases when hydrogen becomes more ionized .",
    "the countering effects of @xmath604 and @xmath257 on @xmath443 in the beginning of the temperature rise , and their concerted effects subsequently produce the mentioned behavior . at @xmath605",
    "the same behavior holds except that @xmath443 increases again as @xmath95 increases beyond @xmath202 .",
    "this occurs because , with the rapid decrease of the hydrogen neutral fraction , radiative recombination of @xmath606 becomes important and @xmath607 increases from the constant value of @xmath608 maintained by charge - exchange reactions .",
    "the two ratios @xmath332 and @xmath609 have very similar dependences on @xmath98 and @xmath95 , as to be expected .",
    "the requirement of @xmath610 confines the pertinent densities to @xmath611 for @xmath612 and even higher limits for @xmath613 .",
    "thus the large @xmath332 and @xmath594 model values at @xmath614 are not relevant .",
    "they actually involve very small fluxes , but are shown for uniformity in the density range covered .",
    "as @xmath98 increases from @xmath615 at a fixed temperature , both @xmath442 and @xmath594 rise rapidly .",
    "two factors contribute to this .",
    "first , while @xmath473 is fairly constant in that density range ( cf . fig .",
    "5 ) , the fraction of calcium in @xmath3 increases with @xmath98 .",
    "second , the onset of collisional de - excitation of the @xmath3 population occurs , by comparison with hydrogen , at a higher @xmath98 .",
    "when the latter is reached , the consequent collisional quenching of the @xmath3 triplet emissivity causes the decline of the ratio from its peak .",
    "both @xmath332 and @xmath594 reach their highest value at @xmath571 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the hydrogen line emissivities are fairly insensitive to temperature for @xmath591 ( cf .",
    "the @xmath422 emissivity , on the other hand , decreases with increasing @xmath95 above @xmath553 , owing to the rapidly decreasing @xmath3 fraction .",
    "thus the two ratios fall beyond @xmath616 . at @xmath617",
    "collisional excitations of both @xmath3 and @xmath146 are sensitive functions of temperature because of the strong dependence of @xmath377 on @xmath95 ( cf .",
    "fig.5 ) , and the higher ratio of excitation potential to thermal energy . above @xmath618 , however , collisional de - excitation comes into play for hydrogen , and the @xmath11 emissivity increases only modestly with increasing temperature in comparison with the @xmath3 triplet emissivity which , until @xmath619 , is still proportional to ( @xmath620)(@xmath377 ) , and the steeper rise of @xmath621 with increasing @xmath95 from @xmath410 more than overcomes the counter effect of a lower @xmath620 ratio . as a result ,",
    "@xmath332 increases as @xmath95 increases from @xmath410 and , in conjunction with its fall at @xmath613 , peaks at an intermediate temperature .",
    "regarding the @xmath445 ratio , both recombination and cascade and collisional excitation strongly favor @xmath144 over @xmath85 emission .",
    "this ratio is less than unity only because of the @xmath172 fluorescence process which , as seen from figure 16 , is most effective at @xmath98 between @xmath481 and @xmath622 . at @xmath623 , even though @xmath172 fluorescence remains more effective than the other two processes , @xmath445 increases as @xmath98 decreases .",
    "this is because stimulated absorption of the stellar and veiling continua contributes prominently to the @xmath144 emissivity .",
    "but the line fluxes involved are very small .",
    "@xmath445 also increases as @xmath98 increases above @xmath624 .",
    "this is because collisional de - excitation begins to affect the hydrogen level population , causing @xmath272 , the important factor in the @xmath172 fluorescence rate , to be nearly constant , while collisional excitation of @xmath144 continues to grow roughly as @xmath625 .",
    "thus , in this regime @xmath445 responds to increasing density in a fashion similar to @xmath594 , but it has not reached a peak even at @xmath590 because collisional de - excitation of @xmath144 remains weaker than @xmath626 escape .",
    "the dependences of the four emissivity ratios on @xmath192 between @xmath627 and @xmath380 are not strong , with @xmath628 and @xmath594 reaching somewhat higher values for @xmath629 when @xmath630 .",
    "there is also a weak dependence on @xmath41 . among the four cases of @xmath192 and @xmath41 , the ( @xmath358 , @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath550 , @xmath415 ) cases show the largest difference .",
    "figure 17 shows the relations between @xmath332 and @xmath443 and between @xmath594 and @xmath445 for the case ( @xmath631 , @xmath47 ) , and figure 18 shows those for the case ( @xmath550 , @xmath415 ) .",
    "in addition to the data points marked , we mention that @xmath594 can be determined for the remaining 5 objects in the data set of muzerolle et al.(1998b ) .",
    "it is 4.5 , 12.7 , 9.8 , 0.81 , and 1.31 for dr , cw , rw , ds , and uy tau respectively .",
    "thus it appears that the observed values of @xmath594 separate into two groups .",
    "the full data set of edwards et al.(2010 ) also indicates this dichotomy , namely , one group with @xmath332 or @xmath594 close to or less than 1 , the other with @xmath332 or @xmath594 greater than @xmath632 . the physical conditions that will produce the first group of values are @xmath98 around @xmath14 and @xmath95 between @xmath633 and @xmath16 ( cf . figs .",
    "15 & 16 ) , but the temperature is narrowed to @xmath634 when the constraints imposed by the observed @xmath318 ratios are also implemented ( cf .",
    " 6.2.2 ) . to produce the second group of values a considerably higher @xmath98 , @xmath18 ,",
    "is required , while @xmath95 is restricted to @xmath635 .",
    "the cttss with @xmath422 emission much stronger than @xmath11 or @xmath85 emission also tend to be the ones with the most prominent @xmath10 emission .",
    "the physical conditions needed to produce the @xmath332 ratio can not produce the @xmath331 ratio , so a separate region producing the bulk of the @xmath10 emission is additionally required , as already inferred in  6.1 .",
    "the @xmath3 emission region itself appears to be capable of generating the observed ratios among the hydrogen lines ( cf .",
    "figs 13 & 14 @xmath571 panel ) .",
    "the cttss with @xmath422 emission comparable to or less than @xmath11 emission have a broad spread in helium emission , from @xmath331 ratios close to those of the previous group to little @xmath10 emission and @xmath6 primarily in absorption ( edwards et al .",
    "2010 ) . when @xmath10 emission is weak , the physical conditions needed to produce the hydrogen line ratios(cf .",
    " 6.2 ) can also generate the requisite @xmath3 emission .",
    "when @xmath10 emission is strong , a separate region producing it is again called upon .",
    "based on the above understanding of the ratios involving @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath3 lines , we draw the following deduction .    \\1",
    ". three sets of physical conditions are identified .",
    "the first , characterized by a comparatively high temperature ( @xmath95 close to @xmath458 ) is necessary to produce strong @xmath10 emission .",
    "the second , characterized by a comparatively high density ( @xmath636 ) and low temperature ( @xmath382 ) , is necessary to produce strong @xmath3 infrared triplet emission .",
    "the third , with less stringent constraints ( @xmath488 , @xmath98 around @xmath14 ) , produce primarily hydrogen emission . when the second set is present , the first set is often present concurrently .",
    "the third set is present either by itself or concurrently with the first set .",
    "it is also likely to be present when both the first and second sets are .",
    "as mentioned in  2 , the specific flux @xmath86 of an optically thick line depends on the line excitation temperature and the emission area with a projected velocity of @xmath17 , @xmath637 .",
    "the excitation temperature , in turn , depends on the local physical conditions ( @xmath98 , @xmath95 , etc . ) and the emission area depends on the specific kinematic model . in particular , for @xmath638 a spherical wind model with @xmath47 has @xmath639 and some leeway in its adjustment by varying @xmath41 , while a spherical infall model with @xmath415 has @xmath640 and little room for maneuver . in a ctts either wind or accretion flow likely fills only a fraction , @xmath641 , of the @xmath642 solid angle .",
    "this dilution affects the actual observed area in a way that depends on viewing angle , whose variation is not included here to keep the paper manageable .",
    "we simply assume an effective observed area given by @xmath643 .",
    "thus , for the same excitation temperature the line flux in the infall model will be @xmath644 or @xmath645 of that in the wind model .",
    "we think this is a conservative estimate in that the true ratio is likely smaller .    for ease in comparison with an observed line , we scale the model @xmath86 to the continuum flux @xmath646 , and present the ratio @xmath647 as a function of density or line optical depth .",
    "our model continuum is represented by a @xmath327 blackbody veiled by a @xmath130 blackbody over 3% of its surface .",
    "thus our model continuum has a veiling contribution at @xmath10 of @xmath648 and one at @xmath6 or @xmath11 of @xmath649 .",
    "when a ctts has a different @xmath650 , @xmath651 , or @xmath652 the model @xmath653 can be easily rescaled to compare directly with the observed line profile .",
    "we shall make use of the information deduced from line ratios to identify the appropriate physical conditions .",
    "since we are calculating the specific flux at @xmath654 it is the ratio of @xmath86s that is pertinent here .",
    "if the two lines have similar profiles , this ratio is close to the ratio of their integrated fluxes , which was used in  6 to identify the physical conditions responsible for the bulk of the emission .",
    "this appears to be the case among @xmath330 , and @xmath11 .",
    "however , @xmath422 is distinctly narrower than @xmath11 .",
    "the contrast is obvious in dr tau , noticeable in dg tau , and measurable in dl tau ( edwards et .",
    "al 2010 ) .",
    "when we come to discussing the @xmath422 specific flux we will take note of the distinction .      in this subsection we select among the hydrogen lines for presentation @xmath9 , the strongest optical member , and @xmath11 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for the availability of large data sets ( efhk06 , folha & emerson 2001 ) .",
    "figures 19 and 20 show , for the wind and infall model respectively , how the @xmath9 and @xmath11 specific fluxes depend on @xmath98 and line optical depth .",
    "the y - axis limits in figure 20 are @xmath655 ( -1.72 in log ) of those in figure 19 , so chosen that , if the specific flux in the infall model is @xmath655 of that in the wind model , the two figures will be visually identical .",
    "they do look very much alike .",
    "when one figure is overlaid on the other , the largest difference in the density dependence plots occurs for @xmath656 at @xmath657 , where the line emissivity is contributed primarily by stimulated absorption of the incident continuum flux which is a factor of @xmath658 larger at @xmath415 .",
    "the optical depth dependence plots , when overlaid together , show larger differences .",
    "this is because at the same @xmath75 ( @xmath659 ) the density in the @xmath415 case is higher and the line specific flux is more sensitive to density than to the velocity gradient , as will be propounded next .    figures 19 and 20 show not only that the primary distinction in the specific flux produced between the wind and infall models arises from the emission area , but also that variation in the velocity gradient ( a factor of @xmath660 larger in the @xmath415 model ) generates only a small change . as a specific example , we consider the case of @xmath574 and @xmath411 , conditions suitable to bringing about the observed @xmath439 ratio .",
    "the value of @xmath661 in the wind model is @xmath662 , while that in the infall model is @xmath663 .",
    "their nearly identical emissivity , @xmath664 , is not surprising since @xmath11 is very optically thick ( @xmath665 and @xmath666 in the wind and infall model respectively , cf .",
    "19 & 20 right bottom panel ) .",
    "even when @xmath11 is optically thin , the difference in emissivity is small .",
    "for example , at @xmath667 , @xmath411 , @xmath668 and @xmath669 in the wind model , while @xmath670 and @xmath671 in the infall model .",
    "the @xmath11 emissivity is a factor of 1.41 smaller with the larger velocity gradient .",
    "however , at the next density step of @xmath672 , @xmath673 in the infall model or a factor of @xmath674 larger than the earlier value . from the slope of the log @xmath653 dependence on log @xmath98 at @xmath675 it can be estimated that the larger velocity gradient by a factor of @xmath660 can be compensated by an increase in @xmath98 by a factor of only @xmath676 to produce the same line emissivity .",
    "for this reason , even though we emphasize the location where @xmath44 , the local excitation calculations of line emissivities and ratios are applicable elsewhere because a large variation in the local velocity gradient is tantamount to only a modest variation in the density .",
    "the two figures also show that over the density range @xmath677 the dependences of @xmath656 and @xmath661 on temperature are strong for @xmath678 , but weak for @xmath679 .",
    "this is because , despite the stronger collisional excitation with @xmath95 increasing above @xmath553 , the concomitant more rapid buildup of population into high @xmath186 levels produces a stronger collisional ionization and reduces the neutral fraction .    the 38 @xmath11 profiles in the reference sample of efhk06 provide a convenient data set of @xmath653s for comparison with our model results . to avoid the difficulty of extracting the underlying red emission",
    "when a red absorption is obviously or probably present , we concentrate on the blue wing emission and determine @xmath653 at @xmath680 . of the 38 objects , 9 ( dr , cw , dl , hl ,",
    "dg , dk & hn tau , as 353 a , rw aur a ) have high @xmath25 veiling ( @xmath681 ) , of whom 8 have @xmath682 and 1 ( dk tau ) has @xmath683 ; 11 ( ds , hk , bp , df , do , gg , & gk tau , yy , & gw ori , uy aur , uz tau e ) have intermediate @xmath25 veiling ( @xmath684 ) , of whom 10 ( excepting gk tau ) have @xmath685 . of the remaining 18 objects with low @xmath25 veiling ( @xmath686 ) ,",
    "2 ( su aur , tw hya ) have @xmath653 between @xmath461 and @xmath80 , and the rest have @xmath687 .    for members in the first veiling group ,",
    "our model @xmath653s , when scaled to the ctts s stellar plus veiling continuum , need to be reduced by a factor of @xmath291 or more .",
    "then , at the physical conditions needed to produce the @xmath318 ratios ( @xmath98 centered around @xmath14 , @xmath688 , or @xmath98 centered around @xmath689 , @xmath571 , cf .",
    " 6.2.2 & fig . 13 ) and assuming that these ratios of integrated fluxes are the same as the ratios of specific fluxes at @xmath65 , the @xmath653 values in the infall model will be less than @xmath534 .",
    "they fail to produce the values of those 9 objects by factors ranging from @xmath690 to @xmath691 .",
    "we therefore conclude that a kinematic flow other than accretion infall is responsible for those hydrogen emission .",
    "we also draw the same conclusion for the majority of the members in the second @xmath25 veiling group .",
    "the infall model has difficulty not only accounting for their specific fluxes at @xmath692 but also their observed line wing asymmetry ( say , at @xmath693 ) .",
    "thus , whereas in the infall model the blue wing emission is occulted by the star and therefore expected to be weaker than the red wing emission , only gk tau shows this characteristic , 2 ( df & do tau ) have comparable blue and red wing emission , and the remaining 8 have stronger blue wing emission . to be sure , ds tau and yy ori have obvious red absorptions , and dk tau and uy aur may have weak red absorptions that make it difficult to discern the underlying red wing emission ; nevertheless , the lines of sight that favor seeing a red absorption are also the ones that incur stellar occultation of the blue wing emission .",
    "then the earlier conclusion with regard to the high veiling group also implies that whatever kinematic region responsible for their hydrogen emission can also produce the moderate hydrogen emission seen in the second @xmath25 veiling group .",
    "the wind model poses the opposite conundrum in that the model @xmath653s are much larger than those observed in the high @xmath25 veiling group , by factors of about 4 - 10 .",
    "it can be responsible for the observed hydrogen emission provided the optically - thick emitting gas ( @xmath694 , cf .",
    "19 right bottom panel ) fills only a portion of the postulated flow , and covers but a fraction of the contour surface shown in figure 1 .",
    "this also happens to be the necessary proviso to avoid the occurrence of a blue absorption .",
    "thus the wind flow needs to be highly inhomogeneous , with the density of the emitting gas considerably higher than that pervading the bulk of the flow .",
    "the temperature of the emitting gas is probably @xmath695 , since the line emissivity at a higher temperature is not higher and the filling factor likely decreases rapidly with increasing temperature above @xmath357 , owing to the stronger cooling at a higher temperature .",
    "it is also probably @xmath696 , otherwise the density needed to produce the @xmath318 ratios would be around @xmath697 , an order of magnitude greater than that needed at @xmath688 , yet the @xmath11 emissivity is about the same , so the filling factor required of the gas at @xmath698 is as high and therefore more restrictive .    among the optical hydrogen lines",
    "@xmath9 has the highest optical depth , @xmath699 .",
    "this can be seen from figure 19 which shows that at @xmath574 and @xmath411 @xmath150 exceeds @xmath133 , the upper bound on the abscissa .",
    "the high @xmath150 leads to a fair amount of emission in the damping wings and likely accounts for the conspicuous extension of the observed @xmath9 profile at the base .",
    "thus , assuming just natural broadening of the emission profile , the rate of emitting @xmath9 photons that are displaced from line center by @xmath700 thermal widths is @xmath701 , where @xmath702 , @xmath703 is the summed radiative decay rate from the upper and lower states of @xmath9 , and @xmath704 the thermal doppler frequency width .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath489 is sufficiently large that the emission is not re - absorbed . with the total @xmath9 emission rate being @xmath705 , the fraction of photons emitted beyond @xmath489 thermal widths is then @xmath706 . at @xmath357",
    "the thermal doppler velocity width is @xmath707 , so for @xmath708 , the fraction of @xmath9 photons emitted at @xmath709 is @xmath710 .",
    "figure 21 shows the analogous plots of @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the infall model .",
    "the stellar plus veiling continuum at @xmath711 of the cttss in the sample of folha & emerson ( 2001 ) is not listed but most likely significantly stronger than our model value because of the typically high @xmath25 veiling observed and probable contribution from dust emission ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2003 ) . even assuming that our model continuum is representative , the model @xmath712 , at the appropriate conditions indicated by the @xmath318 ratios , is @xmath713 and falls short of quite a few observed values .",
    "thus , among the 49 objects with @xmath23 profiles 8 ( dg , dl , dr , hl , & cw tau , gm , & rw aur , yy ori ) have , at @xmath65 , @xmath714 , 8 ( gg , ry , do , ds , & fs tau , uy , & su aur , v1331 cyg ) have @xmath715 , and 10 ( bm and , de ,",
    "df , dk , hk , bp , gi , hp , & t tau , gw ori ) have @xmath716 .",
    "again then , a comparison between model results and @xmath23 data leads to the same conclusions deduced earlier .",
    "it is interesting that the objects with strong ( moderate ) @xmath23 flux at @xmath717 also have strong ( moderate ) @xmath11 flux .",
    "this may simply be a confirmation of both the finding of bary et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that the @xmath441 ratio does not vary strongly among cttss and the assumption of similar @xmath11 and @xmath23 profiles .    in summary , based on the hydrogen line specific fluxes at @xmath718",
    ", we arrive at the following conclusions regarding the infall accretion and wind flows .",
    "the infall accretion flow is not responsible for the strong or moderate hydrogen emission at @xmath717 .",
    "we can extend this inference to the bulk of the observed emission for the following reasons .",
    "first , the emission generated by gas with @xmath719 is a substantial fraction of the total , since the same particles also contribute to observed emission at @xmath720 when their trajectories do not parallel the line of sight .",
    "a rough estimate of the line profile produced by them in an azimuthally symmetric distribution is a flat - top shape in the regime @xmath721 . using this guideline to determine the fraction of the blueward emission ( to avoid the red absorption )",
    ", we find from figure 3 of efhk06 that 19 ( excepting gk tau ) of 20 cttss in the high and intermediate veiling groups ( @xmath722 ) have this fraction @xmath723 .",
    "second , with the velocity distribution expected to be a smooth function , the infall model will also have difficulty accounting for the observed specific fluxes at @xmath724 somewhat less than @xmath43 .",
    "third , whatever kinematic structure called for to produce the observed emission at @xmath725 will likely have gas particles moving at @xmath726 .",
    "all these considerations lead us to conclude that the bulk of the @xmath11 emission in these cttss arise from a kinematic structure other than the accretion flow .    \\2 . for the wind flow to be responsible for the moderate or strong hydrogen emission the emitting gas , whose density is considerably higher than that of the gas occupying the bulk of the flow , can only fill a small fraction of the volume .",
    "these conclusions remain true , of course , when the two flows are compared at the lower ionization rate of @xmath550 . for either flow the specific fluxes are almost identical to those in the @xmath727 case at @xmath688 , and are weaker at @xmath728 , as can be deduced from the contrast in the @xmath370 contours between the two ionization cases ( fig .",
    "4 ) . thus , for ( @xmath9 , @xmath11 )",
    "the @xmath653s at @xmath729 and @xmath730 with @xmath550 are smaller by a factor of ( 2.55 , 4.14 ) and ( 1.06 , 1.16 ) respectively at @xmath571 , and ( 3.67 , 6.64 ) , and ( 1.92 , 2.69 ) respectively at @xmath397 .",
    "this dependence of @xmath653 on @xmath192 when @xmath95 is @xmath19 , as well as @xmath653 s rapid rise with @xmath95 increasing above @xmath385 at a given @xmath192 lead us to favor the temperature in the hydrogen emission region being @xmath731 .",
    "figures 22 and 23 show the @xmath732 @xmath653s as a function of density and line optical depth for the wind and infall model respectively . like the @xmath331 ratio , the model results for the @xmath1 specific fluxes at @xmath733 are very close to those at @xmath451 and are not shown .",
    "the 22 @xmath10 broad - component profiles in figure 7 of bek01 present a convenient data set for comparison with our model results .",
    "we again look at the specific flux at @xmath734 to avoid the red absorption which appears to affect several profiles .",
    "the 22 optical veilings range from 0.1 to 20 , and the observed @xmath653s range from 0.01 to 0.5 , but the correlation between @xmath653 and @xmath651 does not appear to be strong .",
    "eight objects ( cw , hn , dg , dl , & dr tau , as 353 a , rw & uy aur ) have @xmath735 and @xmath651 between 0.8 and 20 , 4 ( gg , dq , & df tau , gm aur ) have @xmath736 and @xmath651 between 0.2 and 0.7 , and the rest have @xmath687 and @xmath651 between 0.1 and 4.7 . with our model @xmath651 of 0.67 ,",
    "the model @xmath653s likely need to be lowered ( raised ) for comparison with the first ( second ) veiling group . even for observed @xmath653s as high as 0.5 , it appears that the infall model can accommodate them . as a specific example",
    ", we assume that the @xmath331 ratio is 0.4 and determine from figure 8 that the required physical conditions can be ( @xmath451 , @xmath737 ) , ( @xmath738 , @xmath739 ) , or ( @xmath740 , @xmath741 ) which produce , as seen from figure 23 , a @xmath742 in each case .",
    "the @xmath10 optical depth is greater than 50 ( cf .",
    "23 right bottom panel ) , so a red absorption will be seen for certain lines of sight . for smaller",
    "observed @xmath653s , however , a small filling factor of the emitting gas can be invoked to reduce the incidence of red absorption .",
    "the @xmath25 spectroscopic survey of cttss by efhk06 also procures a set of @xmath6 profiles .",
    "most of them have strong absorption features , so we consider solely the high @xmath25 veiling group ( @xmath743 ) whose members are among the objects with the strongest @xmath6 emission .",
    "excluding dk tau which has only absorption features , we determine the @xmath653s at @xmath744 to avoid the blue absorptions .",
    "they range from 0.3 to 1.3 .",
    "our model @xmath652 is 0.19 , but even lowering the model @xmath653s considerably for comparison with the cttss with particularly high @xmath652s , it appears that the infall model can produce the highest observed @xmath6 specific fluxes .    for both @xmath6 and @xmath161",
    "it is also clear that their emission are far too strong in a laminar wind flow , and that the gas producing the helium emission can only occupy a fraction @xmath745 of the contour area shown in figure 1 in order to match the observed specific fluxes .",
    "while the above analysis does not directly reject either model , we favor the wind region as the production site of strong helium emission for the following reasons .    \\1 . except near the accretion shock where @xmath5 photons are produced",
    ", the required temperature of @xmath746 is difficult to generate and maintain in an accretion flow , which is primarily in free fall . on the other hand",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that acceleration of the gas in a wind would produce heating .",
    "helium emission in the wind is also compatible with the earlier deduced condition for hydrogen emission in the wind in that the decreasing filling factor of the gas with increasing temperature from @xmath384 to @xmath747 is consistent with the cooling and expansion of gas at a higher temperature .",
    "an infalling flow is hard pressed to explain the strong blue asymmetry in the @xmath10 line wings .",
    "judging the emission at @xmath748 ( cf .",
    "fig . 7 of bek01 ) , we find that 18 of the 22 @xmath10 broad components are stronger on the blue side , although 3 of them ( as 353 a , rw & gm aur ) have red absorptions that clearly accentuate the asymmetry , 3 ( dd , df , & do tau ) are stronger on the red side , and 1 ( de tau ) is too weak to discern . while lack of azimuthal symmetry or strong local inhomogeneities can generate asymmetries in the wing emission , their numbers of blue and red asymmetries should , for random lines of sight , statistically balance out . on the other hand , stellar occultation of the approaching accretion flow and disk occultation of the receding wind flow",
    "produce always a red and blue asymmetry respectively .",
    "as seen from figure 1 , the projected area of the @xmath65 contour in the infall model is only slightly larger than the projected stellar surface area .",
    "there is little leeway in adjusting the accretion flow geometry to avoid diminishing the blue wing emission , let alone enhancing it above the red wing emission .",
    "the accretion flow model has greater difficulty producing the @xmath6 profile morphologies of those objects with strong emission ( cf .",
    "fig . 4 of efhk06 ) .",
    "first , while most of the 38 objects have blue and/or red absorptions that make it difficult to decipher the wing emission at @xmath749 , 4 have mostly emission , of whom bp tau s wing emission is too weak to compare its two sides and the remaining 3(cw & hn tau , rw aur a ) all have stronger blue wing than red wing emission , and will pose a challenge to the infall model .",
    "second , when emission above continuum is observed along with absorption , the objects with strong emission tend to associate with blue absorptions indicative of a stellar wind ( cf . fig .",
    "10 of kwan et al .",
    "2007 ) , whereas the objects with strong absorptions on the red side only do not have comparably strong emission ( e.g. , aa tau , bm and , rw aur b , lkca 8 in fig . 4 of efhk06 or fig . 2 of fischer et al .",
    "the latter appear to have both a lower @xmath652 and a smaller equivalent width in the emission above the continuum .",
    "bearing in mind that the observed emission is contributed in part already by scattering of continuum photons , it is surprising , if the accretion flow is the site of helium emission , that the in - situ emission are relatively weak in those accretion flows with particularly large widths and sizes that are needed to produce the broad and deep red absorptions ( cf .",
    " 4.2 & 4.3 of fischer et al .",
    "2008 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the above - mentioned correlation naturally follows if the wind flow is the site of helium emission .",
    "also , in producing the needed in - situ emission there is more leeway afforded the wind model in the choices of @xmath41 and filling factor of the high temperature regions .",
    "the monte carlo simulations by kwan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) already indicate that the @xmath6 profile morphologies can be accounted for by a stellar wind , depending on the opening angle of the wind and the viewing angle .",
    "however , in light of the present finding that the emission regions do not occupy the bulk of the volume , there is the constraint that these regions share the velocity distribution of the gas occupying the bulk of the volume and responsible for the @xmath6 absorption .    in  6.1 where the @xmath331 and @xmath485 ratios are discussed it was mentioned that",
    ", even though their model values generated at @xmath397 , @xmath750 are closest to the observed values ( cf .",
    "fig 10 ) , several reasons argue for a higher temperature .",
    "one , given in  6.2.2 , is based on the difficulty of simultaneously matching @xmath441 at @xmath397 .",
    "we add a second reason here , based on the weakness of the @xmath10 flux at @xmath397 . as seen from figure 22 , its model @xmath653 in the wind model increases from 0.1 to 1.3 as @xmath98 increases from @xmath751 to @xmath730 . reducing it by a factor of 2 upon rescaling it to the continua of the 8 objects with",
    "@xmath651s between 0.8 and 20 and observed @xmath653s between 0.2 and 0.5 , it is clear that the emitting gas need to fill a substantial portion of the contour surface shown in figure 1 in order to match the observed values .",
    "this would , however , produce a blue @xmath10 absorption which is never seen .    as @xmath95 increases from @xmath410 , the @xmath331 ratio first decreases ( cf .",
    "8) and then rises again when @xmath95 exceeds @xmath357 , so we expect the helium emission to arise from regions of temperature above @xmath357 . with @xmath95 increasing from @xmath384 to @xmath458",
    ", the specific fluxes of both @xmath10 and @xmath147 increase rapidly ( cf . fig .",
    "22 ) , but then stay nearly constant for @xmath95 between @xmath752 and @xmath97 . if regions in the wind flow are raised to temperatures above @xmath458 before cooling and expansion come into play , we anticipate them to be most effective in contributing to the observed helium emission when they are at temperatures near @xmath458 .",
    "when @xmath116 is reduced from @xmath753 to @xmath126 the specific fluxes of both @xmath6 and @xmath161 remain almost the same for @xmath754 , but fall rapidly for @xmath755 .",
    "this result can be anticipated from the large difference in the @xmath364 or @xmath465 contour between the two cases of @xmath116 in the temperature range @xmath756 ( cf .",
    "this strong dependence of @xmath1 emission on @xmath116 in that temperature regime , and the need for a higher density to obtain the same @xmath331 ratio as @xmath95 decreases from @xmath458 lead us to favor a temperature range from @xmath757 to @xmath458 for the @xmath506 emission .",
    "it was pointed out in  6.3.2 that the observed @xmath332 ratios of integrated fluxes appear to fall into two groups and , earlier in  7 , that the strong @xmath422 lines are narrower than @xmath11 . for those objects with @xmath758 or less",
    ", the @xmath3 emission can be produced by the set of physical conditions ( @xmath488 , @xmath98 around @xmath14 ) producing primarily hydrogen emission .",
    "the larger issue , of course , concerns the strong emitters with @xmath332 greater than @xmath632 .",
    "their @xmath3 profiles appear narrower than the @xmath11 profiles in the data set of edwards et al .",
    "there may already be a hint of this property from a comparison of non - simultaneous @xmath3 and @xmath11 profiles .",
    "thus , the ratio of specific flux at @xmath65 to that at @xmath759 is smaller for @xmath333 , being 0.27 , 0.1 , and 0.4 for dg , dr , and dl tau respectively ( muzerolle et al .",
    "1998b ) , than for @xmath11 , being 0.46 , 0.33 , and 0.54 ( efhk06 ) .",
    "in view of the possibly different @xmath422 and @xmath11 profiles , we will , in comparing between model and observed values of the @xmath422 specific flux at @xmath65 , not utilize the constraint imposed on the physical conditions by the @xmath332 ratio of integrated fluxes , and consider all densities in the regime @xmath760 as possible .",
    "figure 24 shows the dependences of @xmath653 on @xmath98 , @xmath95 , and line optical depth for the infall model .",
    "the observed values of dg , dr , dl tau and rw aur are 1.4 , 0.6 , 2.5 and 3.7 ( muzerolle et al .",
    "anticipating that the model @xmath653s have to be reduced by a factor of @xmath761 , owing to the strong veilings at @xmath762 ( between 0.7 and 5.1 ) of those objects , we find that , with the exception of rw aur , the infall model can produce the wing emission .",
    "we do not consider this strong enough evidence to argue against the infall model .",
    "the issue concerning the strong @xmath3 emission is , of course , its emission near line center . while our specific flux calculation provides no aid in discriminating between the wind and infall models , the earlier derivation of requisite physical conditions for strong @xmath3 emission ( i.e. , @xmath728 , @xmath98 close to @xmath730 ) remains true , because of the much stronger dependence of the specific fluxes and flux ratios on @xmath98 or @xmath95 than on the velocity gradient . with this in mind",
    ", we do not think the wind region is the site of strong @xmath3 emission for the following reasons .",
    "the physical condition of high density and low temperature is incongruous with that inferred from the helium and hydrogen emission , and with the constraint imposed by the lack of blue absorption in @xmath11 . with the bulk of the wind region occupied by gas at a density of @xmath763 ( cf .",
    "4 ) , the hydrogen emitting regions at @xmath764 and @xmath425 , and the indication that lower temperature is associated with lower density and larger filling factor , it does not appear the wind region has the physical conditions needed for strong @xmath3 emission .",
    "the strong @xmath3 emission has a linewidth narrower than the @xmath11 width or the typical velocity extent seen in a broad , blue @xmath178 absorption . if @xmath3 emission originates from the wind region , it is surprising , particularly in the case of dr tau , that , while the @xmath11 and @xmath10 line shapes are quite similar , the @xmath3 line shape is so different .",
    "the strong @xmath3 line appears symmetrical about line center .",
    "it does not have the characteristic feature of a stronger blue emission as exhibited often by @xmath11 and @xmath10 , and attributable to disk occultation of the receding wind .",
    "the strong @xmath3 emission near line center can be produced in an accretion flow .",
    "its narrower width and different line shape from @xmath11 will not be issues .",
    "the condition of @xmath728 is not unreasonable in light of martin s ( 1996 ) calculation of the thermal structure of the infalling gas , and the density criterion of close to @xmath730 may not be too restrictive a constraint on the mass accretion rate if the flow is dilutely filled .",
    "there is a second possible site , the disk boundary layer where the gas dissipates part of its rotational energy before infalling along a stellar magnetic field line .",
    "we will elaborate on our preference in the next section when all the deductions and arguments put forth in ",
    " 5 , 6 , 7 are synthesized .",
    "we will not comment much on the @xmath85 specific flux .",
    "our calculations indicate that the specific flux of @xmath85 rises more rapidly than @xmath11 with @xmath98 increasing from @xmath522 to @xmath730 , causing @xmath443 to be higher at the conditions suitable for strong @xmath3 emission .",
    "thus there is a larger contribution to the @xmath85 line from the @xmath3 emission region than is the case for @xmath11 .",
    "in   5 , 6 we have presented calculations that shed light on the physical conditions giving rise to the absorption and emission features of most of the prominent lines observed in cttss .",
    "these are excitation calculations that include all the important physical processes affecting the atomic / ionic level population .",
    "they are facilitated by the presence of large velocity gradients expected in a wind or infalling flow in that the level population depend only on the local density ( @xmath98 ) , temperature ( @xmath95 ) , photon ionization rate ( @xmath116 ) , and velocity gradient ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "thus the resulting line emissivity ( @xmath39 ) can be calculated in the ( @xmath98 , @xmath95 , @xmath116 , @xmath46 ) parameter space and the ratio of two line emissivities will demarcate the requisite physical conditions .",
    "one of our findings is that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission regions can occupy only a very small fraction of the wind flow .",
    "our use of @xmath46 for the velocity gradient is then inaccurate , and a more suitable choice would be @xmath765 , where @xmath58 is the linear dimension of an emission region and @xmath57 the thermal / turbulence velocity width . however , as demonstrated in  7.1 , the line emissivity is much more sensitive to @xmath98 than to @xmath46 or @xmath56 , particularly when the line is optically thick , as is true for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 lines studied , so a large change in @xmath46 or @xmath766 occasions only a small change in @xmath98 .",
    "because the requisite physical conditions deduced for the gases responsible for the @xmath6 absorption , @xmath0 emission , @xmath1 emission , and @xmath3 emission are so disparate , we are confident our conclusions are not fundamentally altered by the uncertainty in this parameter . for the same reason , even though we emphasize the two locations of @xmath767 and @xmath136 and the velocity @xmath768 , the results on the ordering of line opacities and the responses of line emissivity ratios to @xmath98 , @xmath95 , and @xmath116 are applicable to other locations and not sensitive to the kinematic structure .",
    "then in  7 we distinguish between the wind and accretion flows by evaluating the specific fluxes of the more important lines at @xmath134 . here",
    "we recapitulate and synthesize the deductions reached separately in ",
    " 5 , 6 , 7 and , in conjunction with other arguments , decide on the locations of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 line emission .",
    "our conclusions drawn with regard to the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 broad line emission in the following subsections apply only to the strong emitters , specific examples of which have been mentioned in ",
    "this qualification arises for the following reasons .",
    "first , the determination of observed line ratios , particularly @xmath331 , is not as reliable for weak emitters because of the presence of absorption features and the contribution to emission from scattering of continuum photons .",
    "second , a couple of our arguments concern the limitations of an infalling flow on the production of line photons , and therefore hinge upon the observational bar placed by the strong emitters .      below we",
    "summarize and discuss the findings obtained from a comparison between model results and observational data on line opacities and line ratios .",
    "they shed light on the properties of the gases responsible for the emission and absorption lines .",
    "optically thick @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission lines .",
    "the gases producing the @xmath330 and @xmath11 , @xmath23 emission are very optically thick in those lines , in order to produce the observed @xmath331 , @xmath441 , and @xmath485 ratios ( cf .   6.1.2 . , 6.2.2 . ) .",
    "separate physical conditions for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 emission .",
    "the need for distinct physical conditions conducive to @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission is demonstrated clearly in figure 10 where it is seen that many of the marked cttss , which are among the strong @xmath10 emitters , have @xmath331 and @xmath435 ratios that can not be simultaneously produced with a common temperature range , but must require that the bulk of the @xmath10 emission be produced at temperatures higher than those producing the bulk of the @xmath11 emission ( cf .",
    " 6.1.2 . ) .    for the strong @xmath10 emission we favor the temperature range @xmath769 .",
    "the upper bound is adopted because the line emissivity at a higher temperature is not higher (  7.2 ) , while presumably the emission area is smaller .",

    "the physical conditions responsible for @xmath0 emission , as deciphered by examining the ratios among the hydrogen lines themselves , namely @xmath318 and @xmath319 , indicate that @xmath98 is centered around @xmath14 for @xmath555 , and @xmath772 for @xmath382 ( cf .",
    " 6.2.2 . ) .",
    "in conjunction with the observed @xmath435 ratio , however , the temperature can be narrowed to the range @xmath773 .",

    "8 & 9 right top panel , ",

    "there are , however , also cttss observed to have @xmath783 and @xmath332 of @xmath784 or less ( e.g. bp tau in figs .",
    "17 & 18 ) , and @xmath11 emission strengths not much weaker than those among the strong @xmath3 emitters .",
    "their @xmath0 and @xmath3 emission indicate @xmath488 and @xmath98 around @xmath14 ( cf .",
    " 6.3.2 ) , as mentioned just earlier .",
    "such physical conditions also naturally arise through cooling of the regions responsible for @xmath1 emission , which is often observed to be strong when @xmath3 emission is strong .",
    "thus we conclude that this set of physical conditions producing primarily @xmath0 emission is also present",
    ". it may indeed be the most prevalent since it is needed when both @xmath10 and @xmath3 emission are weak .",
    "when the latter emission are strong , the other two sets , namely ( @xmath785 , @xmath611 ) for the bulk of the @xmath1 emission and ( @xmath382 , @xmath636 ) for the bulk of the @xmath3 emission , are also present .    the fundamental cause of the distinct sets of physical conditions conducive to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 emission is the different @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 atomic / ionic structures , making their efficacies in photon production sensitive to different temperature ranges .",
    "thus , while @xmath6 and @xmath161 emission rise rapidly with increasing @xmath95 up to @xmath458 , hydrogen emission in balmer , paschen , and higher order lines are not more efficient at @xmath28 because the stronger collisional ionization reduces the neutral hydrogen fraction , and a temperature decreasing below @xmath357 clearly favors @xmath3 over @xmath0 emission .",
    "the separate physical conditions we identify for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 emission regions are therefore understandable and not particular to our excitation model despite its simplifications and approximations .",
    "higher densities for the gases producing the @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission lines than the gas producing the broad , blue absorption .",
    "broad , blue absorptions indicative of a stellar wind are often seen in @xmath6 but almost never in @xmath10 , @xmath23 , or @xmath11 .",
    "this observational constraint , in conjunction with finding 1 above , means that a laminar wind will not be able to produce simultaneously the observed absorption and emission features seen in either @xmath1 or @xmath0 lines .",
    "this dilemma is the same as that realized in earlier wind models of hydrogen line emission ( hartmann et al .",
    "anticipating that the temperature of the gas occupying the bulk of the wind volume is @xmath695 , the constraint placed by the observed absorption features limits the density of this gas to be no more than @xmath387 ( cf .",
    "4 ) , which is considerably lower than the density of the @xmath0 or @xmath1 emission gas .",
    "thus a highly clumpy flow is called for if the @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission regions also reside in the wind ( cf .",
    "  7.1 , 7.2 ) .    \\4 .",
    "in order to produce a @xmath122 in the radial wind , the minimum density needed at the location where the wind reaches a speed of @xmath43 is @xmath786 ( cf .",
    "4 ) , and the corresponding mass loss rate is @xmath787 .",
    "the red absorption gas has a temperature @xmath487 and a density @xmath98 greater than or about @xmath14 .",
    "the former condition is needed to ensure a more prevalent occurrence of red absorptions in the @xmath4 doublet than in @xmath11 ( cf .",
    "6 ,  5.2 ) .",
    "the latter condition is inferred from the observed ordering of the lines in propensity of showing a red absorption .",
    "@xmath5 photoionization is necessary to produce the broad red and blue absorptions seen in @xmath6 .",
    "this is demonstrated forcefully by the more prevalent occurrence of red absorptions in @xmath6 than in @xmath11 , given that the low temperature of the absorption gas ( @xmath369 as noted above ) renders collisional excitation futile ( cf .",
    "@xmath5 photoionization of @xmath1 in the gas occupying the bulk of the wind flow is also needed to produce @xmath788 blue absorptions since it is most likely that the temperature of that gas is also @xmath789 if the hydrogen emission regions occupy only a small fraction of the volume and have a temperature @xmath634 . with the main depopulation path of the highly metastable @xmath6 lower level being collisional excitation to the @xmath235 state , whose rate decreases with decreasing @xmath95 and @xmath188 , a @xmath790 is quite realizable at @xmath791 even for low ionization fluxes ( cf .  5.1 ) .",
    "we therefore think @xmath5 photoionization is also the excitation mechanism responsible for the sharp blue absorptions and central absorptions seen in @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath5 photoionization of @xmath146 in the bulk of either the wind or accretion flow is not as crucial , but it likely contributes , particularly if the gas temperature is @xmath792 , given that @xmath5 photons are already present for @xmath1 ionization .",
    "in the regions producing either @xmath0 or @xmath1 optical and infrared line emission collisional excitation is the primary mechanism , and @xmath5 photoionization plays a less significant role .",
    "we will make use of these findings and additional ones deduced in  7 , as well as arguments based on correlations among absorption and emission features , to support our decisions on the emission sites of the strong @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath3 lines in the following two subsections .",
    "we first summarize the arguments against the accretion flow as the appropriate site .",
    "difficulty for an infalling flow to account for the stronger blue wing emission . in ",
    " 7.1 , 7.2 we have listed cttss to show that both @xmath11 and @xmath10 have distinctly a stronger blue wing . in an infalling flow the emission area at @xmath692",
    "is not much larger than @xmath793 ( cf .",
    "1 ) , so it is very difficult to avoid stellar occultation of the infalling flow approaching an observer .",
    "this preferential attenuation of the blue wing emission is intrinsic to the infall flow geometry , but is counter to the observed trend .",
    "difficulty for an infalling flow to produce the observed fluxes in the line wings .",
    "the finding that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission lines are optically thick means that their specific fluxes depend on the emission area and the line excitation temperatures . for an infalling flow its geometry severely confines the projected areas with large @xmath794s .",
    "the hydrogen lines face , in addition , a strong limitation on their excitation temperatures through the @xmath184 collisional excitations that lead to rapid ionization at @xmath28 . as a result",
    "we find that the observed @xmath23 and @xmath11 fluxes at @xmath795 can not be produced by our infall model over the broad ranges of physical parameters explored .",
    "this result is not surprising , as it is simply an alternative , albeit more explicit , way of phrasing previous findings that the hydrogen profiles calculated from accretion flow models are narrower than observed ( folha & emerson 2001 ) .",
    "interestingly , the steep rise of the helium line emissivity with increasing @xmath95 from @xmath384 to @xmath458 ( cf . fig .",
    "23 ) enables the infall model to reproduce the observed @xmath1 line fluxes .",
    "however , a temperature @xmath796 is required , and we think it is difficult to heat the gas , which is primarily in free fall , to those temperatures , except possibly near the impact sites where photoionization heating by photons generated in the shocks can be important .",
    "it has also been deduced earlier that the gas occupying the bulk of the infalling flow has a temperature @xmath789 , so we do not think the accretion flow generally has the physical conditions conducive to strong @xmath1 emission .",
    "weak or no correlation between strong @xmath6 red absorptions and strong @xmath11 or @xmath10 emission .",
    "if @xmath11 or @xmath10 is produced in the accretion flow , it is reasonable to expect that presence of a strong @xmath6 red absorption should be accompanied by a strong @xmath11 or @xmath10 line . from figures 3 and 4 of efhk06",
    "it is seen that among the cttss with the strongest @xmath6 red absorptions , 2 ( dk tau , yy ori ) have moderate @xmath11 emission , but 7 ( aa , gi , dn , & v830 tau , bm and , rw aur b , lkca 8) have only weak @xmath11 emission . in the simultaneous @xmath25 and optical data sample of edwards et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , of the 6 objects with strong @xmath6 red absorptions , only 1 ( dr tau ) has strong @xmath11 and @xmath10 emission , while the rest ( dk , gk , aa , & gi tau , bm and ) have weak @xmath11 and @xmath10 ( broad component ) emission .",
    "it is noted in  5.2 that when @xmath364 is @xmath26 the @xmath9 opacity is close to or higher than @xmath364 .",
    "then if the @xmath9 emission originate in the accretion flow , which is probably within the radial wind , it will be scattered by the wind , and the resulting observed profile will be highly asymmetric with the red side much strong than the blue side .",
    "the collection of 31 @xmath9 profiles in figure 15 of bek01 shows that such profiles are rare , with as 353a , dr tau , and do tau being the lone examples .",
    "absence of correlation between @xmath10 broad component and narrow component emission .",
    "a narrow line , either on top of a broad one or by itself , is seen in @xmath11 ( efhk06 ) , the @xmath3 infrared triplet ( muzerolle et al .",
    "1998b ) , and most frequently and prominently in @xmath10 ( bek01 ) .",
    "this observational result is understandable if the narrow line emission is formed in the post - shock regions at the impact sites of the infalling flow on the star , since the @xmath1 lines form at higher temperatures and will likely reach higher excitation temperatures than the @xmath0 and @xmath3 lines .",
    "the @xmath506 narrow component ( nc ) strength , being sensitive to the surface area of impact and the pre - shock density , is then a good indicator of the accretion flow magnitude .",
    "then , if the @xmath10 broad component ( bc ) arises from the accretion flow , one would expect a correlation between the bc and nc strengths . even though , with the available information of bc and nc equivalent widths ( @xmath797 ) and red veilings ( @xmath798 ) , a direct plot of the bc flux versus nc flux for the sample of 31 cttss",
    "can not be made , we can obtain a sense of this correlation from figure 1 of bek01 .",
    "there it is seen that among those cttss with the highest values of @xmath799 in the bc 4(cw , hn , & dg tau , as 353a ) have no or comparatively much weaker nc , 3(dl tau , rw & uy aur ) have a comparatively weaker nc ( but typical , in terms of @xmath799 in the nc , relative to the whole sample ) , and 1 ( dr tau ) has a comparatively weaker nc ( but strong relative to the whole sample ) .",
    "then among those cttss with the highest values of @xmath799 in the nc 2(dd & do tau ) have a comparable bc , and 2(fm & hk tau ) have no bc .",
    "we judge from this comparison between the bc and nc values of @xmath799 that there is no correlation between their strengths , and conclude that the broad helium line emission is generally not related to the accretion flow .",
    "we can extend this conclusion to the hydrogen line emission . even though the 38 @xmath11 profiles in efhk06 and the 31 @xmath10 profiles in bek01 are not simultaneous , we see that the group of cttss with strong ( weak ) @xmath10 bc is almost the same as the group of cttss with strong ( weak ) @xmath11 emission .",
    "while the above - mentioned characteristics of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 line profiles pose severe difficulties for an infalling flow , they favor a wind flow for the line origin . these include the stronger blue wing emission and the usually blue centroid ( both owing to disk occultation of the wind flow receding from an observer ) , high blue wing velocities ( as there is no limitation on the terminal wind speed ) , and the association of strong @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission with blue absorptions in @xmath6 that are indicative of a stellar wind .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 specific fluxes , either at the line wings or at line center , are not fundamental issues in the wind model , even though their observed values , as well as the absence of blue @xmath11 and @xmath10 absorptions , stipulate that the emission arise from only a small fraction of the wind volume .",
    "the physical conditions and filling factors deduced for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission regions may indeed be brought about through the expansion and cooling of high temperature , high pressure clumps .",
    "it does remain to be demonstrated , however , that there is a viable acceleration process that produces a highly clumpy flow . despite this uncertainty ,",
    "the overall positive comparision between model and observed line profiles and strengths , together with earlier arguments against the accretion flow , lead us to decide squarely on the wind region as the site of the strong @xmath0 and @xmath1 line emission .",
    "the possibility of strong photoionization heating of the accretion flow near the impact shock , however , means that @xmath1 line emission , possibly strong , may occasionally arise from the accretion flow . in ",
    "7.2 it is pointed out that statistically the @xmath10 profiles show a definite preference for a stronger blue wing , but 3 ( dd , df , & do tau ) clearly have a red centroid ( cf . fig .",
    "7 of bek01 ) .",
    "such a red asymmetry can be brought about if the emission arise primarily from the part of the accretion flow with a @xmath800 velocity component towards the disk , specifically the part at polar angle @xmath801 in a dipolar trajectory , which is the part close to the impact shock ( bek01 ) .",
    "the three profiles are much weaker at @xmath692 than at @xmath802 and also have strong narrow components .",
    "thus , based on the @xmath10 profile morphologies , an origin of the helium emission in an accretion flow is favored for those three objects .",
    "a possible caveat is the uncertain extent to which azimuthal asymmetries in flow geometry and physical conditions affect the profiles .",
    "this can only be answered by time monitoring in both optical and @xmath25 spectral regions , so that the relative contributions from the radial wind and accretion flow can be assessed through analysis of both @xmath178 and @xmath161 profiles .",
    "the great majority of observed @xmath1 profiles , however , show characteristics that favor a wind origin .      in  7.3",
    "we argue against the wind region as the site of the strong @xmath3 infrared triplet emission and mention that , in addition to the accretion flow , the disk boundary layer is a possible site .",
    "in essence this boundary layer , where the accreting particles dissipate part of their rotational energies before falling along the stellar field lines , is the base of the accretion flow . here",
    "we list the reasons why the @xmath3 emission from this base may be significant .",
    "the energy dissipated in the disk boundary layer is a significant fraction of the total gravitational potential energy released by the infalling gas .",
    "most of this energy emerges in a photon continuum which we identify as part of the observed continuum excess around @xmath25 .",
    "like the situation in a stellar atmosphere , the chromospheric region above the continuum formation zone in this boundary layer will produce @xmath3 infrared triplet emission , but the line profile , instead of being narrow , will be doppler broadened by the strong rotational motion .",
    "there appears to be a correlation between the @xmath422 line strength and the excess @xmath25 continuum flux ( fischer et al . 2010 )    \\2 .",
    "the profiles of the strong @xmath422 emitters ( muzerolle et al .",
    "1998b , edwards et al . 2010 ) appear fairly symmetrical . to be sure the @xmath342 line in the red wing needs to be subtracted , and",
    "the profile contains uncertain amounts of contribution from the accretion flow and the hydrogen emission regions in the wind flow .",
    "but if this profile characteristic , as well as the narrower width in comparison with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines , holds up in more strong @xmath3 emitters , it is consistent with rotational broadening .",
    "the same broadening also produces a depression at line center , but the centrally peaked @xmath3 emission from the accretion flow and from the hydrogen emission regions in the wind flow may fill it up .",
    "the continuum produced in the disk boundary layer , like that produced at the accretion footpoints , increases with mass accretion rate , but unlike the latter , also increases with decreasing distance of its location from the star .",
    "thus there may only be a weak correlation between the optical / uv and @xmath25 continuum excesses . then",
    ", if the @xmath3 narrow and broad emission arise from the accretion shocks and disk boundary layer respectively , they will reflect a similar relation between their strengths .",
    "the 11 @xmath3 line profiles shown in figure 1d of muzerolle et al .",
    "( 1998b ) show that the weak broad @xmath3 emitters have small @xmath803 and distinct narrow components , while the strong broad emitters have larger @xmath803 and at best weak narrow components , although their appearances are rendered less conspicuous by the presence of the strong broad emission and the stronger underlying continuum .",
    "it does appear that the correlation between the @xmath3 broad and narrow emission strengths is weak , but more objects are needed for better statistics .",
    "we are confident that the strong @xmath3 emission do not originate from the wind region , and think that a good portion of it arises from the disk boundary layer .",
    "in this section we discuss the implications of the findings described earlier in  8 .",
    "they include the need of a clumpy wind , identifying the source of ionizing photons , and determining the underlying cause of the correlation between strong @xmath3 and @xmath1 line emission .",
    "most of this discussion is speculative in nature .",
    "a clumpy wind has also been advanced by mitskevich et al .",
    "their motivation is to explain the blue absorption seen in @xmath9 as being an intrinsic part of line formation in a stellar wind that accelerates to a peak velocity and then decelerates towards zero .",
    "our arguments for a clumpy wind are not dependent on a specific velocity structure .",
    "one is based on the lack of blue absorptions in @xmath11 and @xmath10 , whose observed intensities are not strong enough to cover up underlying absorptions of the continuum .",
    "so , whatever the velocity structure , the optically thick emission regions can only screen a small fraction of the stellar surface at each @xmath17 . the other",
    "is based on the need to reduce the model intensities of all the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines , calculated assuming a smooth flow with physical conditions suitable to produce the line ratios , in order to match the observed values .    with regard to the accelerating and then decelerating wind advocated by mitskevich et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , we have several reservations for its general applicability to cttss .",
    "first , the @xmath23 and @xmath11 lines are also quite optically thick ( @xmath804 , cf . fig .",
    "11 ) but , unlike @xmath9 , they rarely show a blue absorption .",
    "second , the maximum blue velocity seen in @xmath6 or @xmath11 is often @xmath805 ( efhk06 ) . if this is reached at @xmath806 , the locale adopted by mitskevich et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , the gravitational pull of a ctts of @xmath807 and @xmath50 will only decelerate it to @xmath808 , not low enough to explain most of the @xmath9 blue absorptions , whose maximum depths usually occur at @xmath809 ( cf . fig . 15 of bek01 ) .",
    "we think that the @xmath9 blue absorptions , other than the broad ones that originate in a radial wind , are caused by disk winds lying beyond the hydrogen emission zone .",
    "they are fairly sharp and narrow , similar to those produced by a disk wind scattering the stellar continuum ( kwan et al .",
    "however , because the hydrogen emission zone is more extensive than the stellar surface , a revised modelling is needed to ascertain the absorption profile .",
    "one possible mechanism for accelerating the gas and initiating a clumpy flow is the occurrence of multiple coronal mass ejections .",
    "these ejections will have to be much more energetic than those in the solar corona and occur at a much higher frequency , since the wind density needs to be @xmath810 to produce a @xmath364 of @xmath811 , thereby implicating a minimum mass loss rate of @xmath812 .",
    "the clumpy gas distribution can arise from the initial multiple ejection centers and the shocked regions produced when the different ejectas intersect .",
    "there can be several sources for the photons needed for helium ionization .",
    "one , known already , is the shocked region at the footpoint of the accretion stream . for an impact velocity of @xmath813 , the temperature in the post - shock region reaches @xmath814 .",
    "cooling by free free emission will produce many photons more energetic than @xmath110 .",
    "a fraction of this radiative luminosity will propagate towards the star and be re - processed into optical and uv continuum seen as veiling , but a fraction will propagate away from the star and may even escape absorption by the infalling flow if the gases fill only partially the overall accretion envelope ( fischer et al .",
    "2008 ) . for an accretion rate of @xmath815 , if 1% of the radiative",
    "luminosity generated escape , the luminosity in photons with energies @xmath395 will be @xmath816 .",
    "ionizing photons can also originate from the wind region , e.g. , at the sites of coronal mass ejections and the filaments formed by intersecting ejectas , likely with comparable luminosities .",
    "as mentioned before , however , the issue with ionizing photons is not so much the availability of sources , but more the propagation distance from a given source . both a clumpy accretion flow and a clumpy wind help to increase the propagation length , but a definitive understanding",
    "will probably need monte carlo simulation of the propagation of photons with energies both near and far away from ionization thresholds , and of photons produced from subsequent recombinations to the ground state , as well as consideration of multiple ionizations when the ejected electron has an energy exceeding the @xmath146 ionization threshold .",
    "we have identified the disk / magnetosphere interface where accreting gases dissipate part of their rotational energies before falling along stellar field lines as a source of energy for both the veiling continuum near @xmath25 and the @xmath3 line emission , and there appears to be a correlation between @xmath652 and the strength of the @xmath3 infrared triplet ( fischer et al .",
    "the correlation of strong @xmath1 line emission and strong @xmath3 line emission is probably a consequence of the correlation between @xmath1 emission and @xmath652 .",
    "bek01 noted that when @xmath10 has a signature indicative of a wind origin the nc is comparatively weak and may be even absent , and suggested a scenerio in which high accretion rates or weak stellar fields may cause the magnetosphere to be crushed sufficiently that the disk extends almost to the star , so impact velocities of the accreting matter will be smaller and less energy will be available for the nc emission .",
    "at the same time a larger fraction of the rotational energy of the accreting matter needs to be dissipated , possibly leading to a larger @xmath652 .",
    "also , the equatorial region of the star will be preferentially torqued , and the resulting differential rotation with latitude may induce stronger magnetic activities for field lines anchored at the polar region and produce a greater mass ejection , leading to stronger @xmath1 line emission .",
    "the minimum coronal density we derive is @xmath786 , and the corresponding mass loss rate is @xmath812 in order to produce a @xmath364 of 1 .",
    "the density and mass loss rate probably span a factor of @xmath817 in range .",
    "they are germane to the investigation of the role of a stellar wind on the angular momentum evolution of a ctts ( matt & pudritz 2005 ) and the numerical simulation of magnetospheric accretion of matter in various field geometries ( romanova et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we have applied our model calculations to cttss because of their extensive information on line fluxes and profiles .",
    "these results on line optical depths , line emissivity ratios , and specific line emissivities from local excitation calculations are usable for the broad lines of other pre - main - sequence stars because the individual star affects the calculations only through its stellar and veiling continua . for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 excitations ,",
    "the effects of these continua via photoionization of and stimulated absorption by excited states are not significant .",
    "the effects on photoionizing @xmath3 and @xmath4 are stronger .",
    "they can be gauged from comparing figures 6 & 7 , which show results for the locations of 4 and @xmath136 respectively .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 line optical depths in the @xmath415 calculation are affected by a smaller @xmath818 factor in the @xmath75 expression and a larger photoionization rate by a factor of 2.56 ( cf . ",
    "together the two factors affect little the @xmath339 contour , but produce a displacement of the @xmath819 contour by a factor of @xmath291 or less .",
    "we first summarize the main results of this work and then comment on future studies that may shed further light on the formation and origins of the line emission in cttss .",
    "our primary conclusions are :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath5 photoionization is needed to produce the @xmath6 opacities in both the accretion flow and radial wind that generate the observed red and broad blue absorptions respectively .",
    "it is also the most probable excitation mechanism responsible for the narrow , sharp blue absorptions and the central absorptions .",
    "the strong @xmath1 and @xmath0 line emission originate primarily in a radial outflow that is highly clumpy .",
    "the bulk of the wind volume is filled by gas at a density @xmath8 and optically thick to @xmath178 and @xmath9 , but optically thin to @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and the @xmath3 infrared triplet .",

    "the area covering factor of these emission clumps is sufficiently small to not incur significant absorption of the stellar and veiling continua in either @xmath1 and @xmath0 lines .",

    ". weak @xmath3 line emission , on the other hand , can come from the clumps producing the @xmath0 emission in the wind .",
    "we plan to follow up this work by presenting all the optical and @xmath25 spectral data procured simultaneously or near - simultaneously ( edwards et al . 2010 ) , with an aim to provide more comparisons with model results on the ratios and specific fluxes of not only lines alluded to here but also others , such as @xmath820 , @xmath821 , @xmath143 , that are useful as consistency checks .",
    "the larger sample will also convey information on the ranges of variation in the line properties and related physical conditions .",
    "it will also apprise of possible correlations among continuum veilings , line ratios , and line fluxes that may elucidate the relationship between accretion and stellar wind activities .",
    "a future project that will be enlightening is time monitoring at optical and @xmath25 spectral regions simultaneously over more than a rotational period for several cttss .",
    "the simultaneous coverage of both spectral regions is needed to include @xmath6 , the key indicator of intervening kinematic structures through its absorption features , and the many optical lines whose strengths and profiles delimit the requisite physical conditions .",
    "the time sequence data can test the often presumption of azimuthal symmetry for either the accretion flow or radial wind and its physical conditions , and provide detailed information for a realistic modelling of both the accretion flow and radial wind geometric structures .",
    "further understanding of the origins and formation of spectral lines can be gained from studying the highly ionized lines , notably @xmath181 , and optical as well as @xmath5 @xmath141 and @xmath145 lines .",
    "there are two potential sites for the highly ionized lines , the stellar wind region and the part of the accretion flow close to the impact shock .",

    "eventually confirmation of a clumpy stellar wind requires an understanding of the energy generation and acceleration process .",

    "if correct , indicate that a significant stellar wind , in terms of mass loss and energy output rates , is an essential component of the star formation process .",

    "it turns out that in the regions responsible for the observed emission the electron densities are quite high , @xmath855 , so collisions dominate the population exchange among the higher energy levels .",
    "the level population then depend mostly on the scaling of the collisional rate coefficients with @xmath186 , which we hope to capture with our fitting procedure .",
    "we calculate the rate coefficients for collisional ionization from the formulas given in johnson ( 1972 ) and determine the three - body recombination coefficients by detailed balance .",
    "in addition to @xmath5 photoionization of the ground state , we include photoionizations of the @xmath212 levels by the stellar and veiling continua .",
    "the photoionization cross - sections are gathered from allen ( 1973 ) and the radiative recombination coefficients to the 15 levels from seaton ( 1959 ) .",
    "we also include radiative absorptions of the stellar and veiling continua at all permitted line transitions except the lyman ones . in principle , the probability of stimulated absorption is the same as the escape probability calculated with the velocity gradient along the trajectory of the incident continuum photon .",
    "it is therefore different from the escape probability of a photon emitted by spontaneous emission , in general .",
    "we will ignore this distinction here , since it does not affect the order of the lines in their opacity magnitudes .",
    "we adopt the helium atomic parameters and many of the collision strengths from the chianti data base ( young et al .",
    "2003 ) which lists energy levels , einstein a rates , and collision strengths for transitions involving one of the four lowest energy states . for the rest of the collision strengths , we obtain them from sawey and berrington ( 1993 ) , the basis of chianti s compilation .",
    "we determine the collisional ionization rate coefficient of the ground state from the cross - sections measured by montague , harrison , & smith ( 1984 ) , and that of the @xmath234 level from the theoretical calculation of cross - sections by taylor , kingston , & bell ( 1979 ) , and gather the rest from the compilation of benjamin , skillman , & smits ( 1999 ) .",

    "( 1999 ) .",
    "the absence of collision strengths involving @xmath856 levels is the reason why our helium model atom has only @xmath857 levels .",
    "there is the concern that , like the case of hydrogen , collisional excitation from the @xmath857 levels to higher ones will likely lead to ionization , so limiting helium to @xmath857 levels will underestimate the helium ionization rate and overestimate the helium level population",
    ". this problem may be somewhat less severe for helium because the separations in energy of the angular momentum states with the same energy quantum number @xmath186 lead to more radiative decay channels , and the ionization of hydrogen by @xmath217 photons provides a steady drainage of the @xmath858 population .",
    "both features tend to dampen the rapid build up of population into levels of higher @xmath186 as the collisional excitations and line opacities increase with increasing density . from the results of the calculations we find that under the physical conditions responsible for the @xmath161 emission the @xmath859 levels account for less than 20% of the total helium ionization rate .",
    "hopefully the errors in helium line fluxes and line ratios are within 20% .",
