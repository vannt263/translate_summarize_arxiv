    "the underestimation is common for gga calculations .",
    "it should be noted that the band gap in our calculations is determined by a conduction band state with sulfur character that extends with a very small density of states below the d - states .    the density of states of fes@xmath0 seen in the top graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : femn - dos ] is dominated by a the sulfur @xmath55 states forming a lower valence band extending from -8  ev to -2  ev .",

    "thus the valence - band edge is of fe - t@xmath47 character .",
    "the conduction band is actually a tail of predominantly sulfur character , which extends below the prominent fe - e@xmath48 states , which rise up at about + 1  ev . due to the small density of states",
    "the tail of the sulfur states is easily overlooked and it is hardly visible in the figure .    at first , we investigated the concentration dependence on the basis of ferromagnetically aligned mn - ions .",
    "this is the case of technological interest , because the spins may be aligned by an external magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : femn - dos ] . the relative stability of the ferromagnetic order relative to antiferromagnetic states will be addressed later in this section .",
    "the mn - t@xmath47 states are located in the same energy region as the fe - t@xmath47 states . because the mn ions have one electron less than the fe ions , the mn - t@xmath47 states have a hole in the t@xmath47 shell .",
    "this spin of this hole results in a magnetic moment , so that the majority - spin and minority - spin states of mn - t@xmath47 character are shifted against each other .",
    "the top of the valence band in the majority - spin direction is of fe character while that of the minority - spin direction is of mn character .",

    "the majority - spin direction has a band gap with only a weak concentration dependence .",
    "this gap decreases abruptly from 0.69  ev in fes@xmath0 to 0.37 - 0.41  ev in the alloys .",
    "in contrast , the band gap in the minority - spin direction shrinks with increasing concentration as the empty t@xmath47 states hybridize more effectively .    for low concentration , i.e. for @xmath57 , a semiconductor is obtained with a band gap of 0.35  ev .",
    "valence and conduction band are both in the minority - spin direction .",
    "the electron transport properties are thus dominated by a single spin direction .    at larger mn concentration , that is for @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ", the minority - spin band gap almost collapses with e@xmath48 below 0.01  ev .",
    "because this band gap is in the minority - spin direction , this material can be considered a half metal for practical purposes .",
    "we expect this material to be of interest for spintronics applications .",
    "the fermi - level moves , however , at higher concentration close to the conduction - band bottom of the majority - spin direction .",
    "this is not immediately evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : femn - dos ] because of the low density of states in the conduction band of the majority - spin direction .",
    "after having discussed the electronic structure of the alloys in the ferromagnetic state , we investigated their stability relative to a competing antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "we investigated the type - iii single - k antiferromagnetic ordering , which has been established experimentally@xcite for mns@xmath0 , as well as the order with antiferromagneticly coupled ( 111 ) planes .",
    "the former requires to double the unit cell in @xmath58 direction .",
    "both antiferromagnetic arrangements produce analogous results : the ferromagnetic order is stable for low mn concentration , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , while at higher mn concentration @xmath38 and @xmath45 the antiferromagnetic order is favorable .",
    "the antiferromagnetic materials are described as metals .",
    "the metallic behavior of the antiferromagnets is attributed to a deficiency of the density functionals used .",
    "calculations with hybrid functionals produce an insulating ground state .",
    "thus , our calculations predict half - metallic behavior in the half - doped regime . at lower concentration",
    "the material becomes more insulating , while at higher doping , that is between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the material turns antiferromagnetic . it may be possible to stabilize the ferromagnetic order also for higher concentrations through an external magnetic field .",
