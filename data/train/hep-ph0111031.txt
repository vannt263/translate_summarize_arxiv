    "one suggested mechanism for the gluon dynamics is given by the ccfm equation @xcite , where the dominance of factorized diagrams in strongly ordered soft gluon emission is used .",
    "recently , it has been shown by using a monte carlo implementation that the ccfm equation gives a good description of a variety of processes in deep inelastic scattering at hera ranging from small to large momentum fraction @xmath0 such as forward jet cross sections , high @xmath1 particle spectra , charm and bottom production @xcite .",
    "a completely different field where the gluon dynamics at small @xmath0 should give rise to many interesting features is polarized deep inelastic scattering .",
    "here one is interested in the way the spin is distributed among quarks and gluons in the nucleon .",

    "a complete formalism incorporating dglap and @xmath3 resummation has been given in@xcite .",
    "in this contribution i will follow the principles discussed in @xcite to derive a polarized version of the ccfm equation for gluons .",

    "[ sec2 ] . after a presentation of the kinematical variables in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] a discussion of the principles of the soft gluon factorization applicable in the polarized case is given in sec .",
    "the derivation of the polarized ccfm equation for gluons can be found in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , which is followed by a comparison to the unpolarized ccfm equation in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] . in order to be able to discuss finally the properties of this equation we consider a single iterative step in the solution of this equation which can be physically identified with dressed single gluon emission in sec .",

    "in traditional spin - physics polarized gluons have been mostly considered as on - shell partons . as an on shell parton",
    "the gluon carries only two polarization states which lie parallel or antiparallel to the spin of the nucleon where the gluon is sitting . in ccfm one",

    "the total hadronic cross section @xmath4 depends in the high energy limit on the helicity state of the electron @xmath5 and the helicity state of the proton @xmath6 . in terms of the @xmath7 factorization",
    "it is a convolution of the unintegrated gluon density @xmath8 and the partonic off - shell cross section @xmath9 , where the spin state @xmath10 of the gluon entering the box - graph comes in .",
    "then we get for the cross sections of the two experiments where the spin - vectors of proton and electron one time lie parallel and one time anti - parallel to each other :    @xmath11    as only relative orientations matter we can identify : @xmath12 so we obtain for the difference of the two hadronic cross sections : @xmath13 one should note that the polarization state 0 does not enter into the polarized cross section @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , also in the unintegrated case , the polarized gluon distribution can be defined as the difference of the probability to find a gluon inside the proton with spin state aligned parallel to the proton spin minus the probability to find a gluon with the corresponding anti - parallel spin alignment . between the unintegrated polarized gluon density @xmath15 and the integrated polarized gluon density @xmath16 one has the relation : @xmath17 the remarkable point is that on the right hand side we have a quantity derived from off - shell gluons while on the left hand side we have the standard gluon parton distribution where one is thinking in terms of on - shell gluons that have only two polarization states .",

    "a systematic analysis of this topic has been performed in ref .",

    "the essential point is that for the polarized contribution we need a spin correlation between the incoming gluon with momentum @xmath45 and the outgoing gluon with momentum @xmath46 .",
    "this means that the polarization flow is in no case allowed to go through the soft emission .",
    "we illustrate the situation in fig .",

    "the first result is therefore that in the polarized case the non - eikonal contribution is absent and we can use the eikonal factorization in the same way for large and for small @xmath0 .",

    "the factorization of the soft gluon emission in terms of eikonal currents leads to the following recurrence relation : @xmath54 the important thing is now the initial condition because this is the place where the polarization enters .",
    "the hard splitting kernels in the ccfm equation should match the dglap splitting kernels in the limits @xmath55 . to see this relation in an explicit way we will work for the last step that generates the initial conditions with the altarelli parisi method itself .",

    "* adding virtual corrections to the tree level results means to multiply with the corresponding form factors as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the requirement that the polarization flow does not enter into the soft emission means that the non - eikonal form factor is absent .",
    "so we have to amend only the eikonal form factor to the tree level result .",
    "the eikonal form factor is the same as in the unpolarized case because the polarization flow does not enter into the soft emission .",
    "the statement means that on the average the soft emission does not know anything of the initial spin state of the gluon .    with these principles in mind",
    "we can write down the integral form for the polarized ccfm equation taking into account only gluons : @xmath93 here the ccfm - kernel has the structure : @xmath94 the ccfm kernel in the polarized case is @xmath7 independent due to the absence of the non - eikonal form factor and the way the scale in @xmath95 is chosen .",
    "but in general it is a function of @xmath7 , for example in the unpolarized case .",
    "the eikonal form factor @xmath96 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath97 and the hard splitting kernel reads : @xmath98",
    "in order to understand the physics of the result obtained in the previous chapter we compare it to the unpolarized ccfm equation . to make the comparison as instructive as possible we show the corresponding equations here together : in integral form the polarized and unpolarized ccfm equation reads : @xmath99 for the ccfm splitting kernels one has : @xmath100 with the eikonal and non - eikonal form factors and hard splitting kernels given by : @xmath101 comparing the two equations one can say something of the underlying physics :    * in the limit of large @xmath0 when the non - eikonal form factor becomes equal to unity , the ccfm equation in the unpolarized as well as in the polarized case becomes identical to the corresponding dglap evolution equation , except for the eikonal form factor .",
    "* there is no @xmath91 pole in the polarized hard splitting kernel @xmath85 in the polarized ccfm equation in parallel to the fact that there is no 1/z pole in the polarized dglap splitting function either .",
    "* in the polarized case we need to see spin correlations all along over the way of the soft emission . for this correlation only diagrams contribute that have no polarization flow into the soft gluons .",
    "for this reason there are no non - eikonal contributions to the polarized ccfm equation .",
    "this is very natural because the non - eikonal contributions in the unpolarized ccfm equation couple actually only to the 1/z pole , which is absent in the polarized case .",
    "* in the polarized case the hard splitting function has the form @xmath102 which means that for small z the polarization is not enhanced by a pole as opposite to the unpolarized case .",
    "to resum , these findings say that soft gluon emission destroys to a large extent the definite polarization state of the incoming gluon and that the soft emission knows on the average not very much of the initial polarization of the gluon .",
    "this result is quite remarkable because it justifies a long termed used practice in polarized mc event generators like pepsi @xcite , where the unpolarized parton showering formalism has been used to simulate the soft gluon emission in polarized events @xcite .",
    "in principle it would be now desirable to take some input distribution @xmath103 , evolve it and compare it with data .",
    "such a project is however beyond the scope of this article because there are a couple of severe problems to be solved first . among those are :    * there is no simple analytic formalism to solve the ccfm equation like in dglap with the conversion into mellin moments .",
    "indeed a genuine solution of the ccfm equation seems to be possible only by means of monte carlo technique .",
    "* for small @xmath74 the hard splitting kernel for gluons goes to a constant , as also the quark splitting functions at least in the dglap formalism do .",
    "so the influence of the quarks in the polarized case is in principle of the same order as the gluons and can not be neglected .    instead of this",
    "we want to investigate a bit more closely how the equation works in the polarized case . in principle",
    "a possible solution could be obtained iteratively by : @xmath104 to restrict the numerical effort as much as possible we restrict ourself to the first order of this iteration and calculate @xmath105 , and for comparison also @xmath106 . from a physical point of view",
    "this corresponds to a single dressed gluon emission .",
    "it is a dressed emission because the eikonal form factor includes virtual corrections to the single soft gluon emission . in this case",
    "all necessary formulas become quite simple . as the starting distributions we use the usual ansatz where the @xmath7 dependence is determined by a gaussian , c.f .",

    "we only want to see what effect the single dressed gluon emission has on the @xmath7 distribution .",
    "it is seen that for small values of @xmath7 there is a difference between the polarized and the unpolarized case due to the fact that in the polarized case the non - eikonal form factor is absent . in both cases",

    "the @xmath7 distribution from the single dressed gluon emission is again of gaussian type , especially in the polarized case where the non - eikonal form factor is absent . in general , for large @xmath7 the behavior is similar in the unpolarized case and in the polarized case .",
    "in this paper we have derived a polarized version for the pure gluon part of the ccfm equation . comparing the polarized version with the unpolarized one",
    "the following remarkable features are seen :    * we have seen that for @xmath80 the hard splitting kernel in the polarized ccfm equation coincides with the @xmath90 pole in the corresponding polarized dglap splitting function .",
    "this is in parallel to the unpolarized case where the @xmath90 pole in the hard splitting function p(z ) is identical to the @xmath90 pole in the corresponding unpolarized dglap splitting function .",
    "* we have shown that due to spin correlation in the polarized case no non - eikonal contributions arise , and that for the same reason also the non - eikonal form factor does not enter into the polarized ccfm equation . *",
    "this is consistent with the observation that there is no 1/z pole in the polarized case for the hard splitting function @xmath85 because the non - eikonal form factor is coupled to that pole .",
    "the absence of such a 1/z pole in @xmath85 is furthermore consistent with the fact that such a pole does not exist in the corresponding polarized dglap splitting function for the gluons . *",
    "finally , we have shown that considering single dressed gluon emission one finds for large @xmath7 a similar broadening of the @xmath7 distribution as in the unpolarized case .",
    "differences occur only for small @xmath7 , where the absence of the non - eikonal form factor becomes noticeable .",
    "next steps to be taken is a comparison to data . here",
    "the first main difficulty will be to solve the polarized ccfm equation which seems to be possible only in terms of a monte carlo simulation of the soft emission .",
    "the second problem lies in the fact that the contribution from the quarks to the total polarized cross section is in principle of the same order as the one from the gluons .",
    "therefore , it will be necessary to extend this formalism to the polarized contributions of the quarks as well . when there are quarks as initial states , a different type of vertex arises , where the polarization flow necessary enters into the soft emission of the final quark . non - eikonal contributions become important and the simple reasoning of the polarization flow we discussed for the gluons can not be applied .",
