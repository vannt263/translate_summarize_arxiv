    "massive black holes ( mbhs ) are commonly found in massive galaxies with a significant bulge component @xcite , but recent discoveries show that they can also be found in bulgeless disk galaxies @xcite and dwarfs @xcite .",
    "it is then unclear whether bulges are related to mbh formation processes , what fraction of low - mass galaxies may host mbhs , and whether mbhs in these galaxies have an important role in galaxy evolution . in this paper",
    "we present a novel approach to seed mbh formation based on the properties of metal - free gas which explains the existence of mbhs in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our simulations , however , suggest that mbhs become infrequent in low ",
    "mass galaxies , and that a minimum galaxy mass exists below which mbhs become progressively uncommon .",
    "mbhs must have originated from moderately massive `` seed '' black holes in order to grow to a billion solar masses by @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these seeds must form at high redshifts ( @xmath7 ) and grow rapidly in order to reproduce the observed distribution of high redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "seeds may be the remnants of population iii stars , which form with extremely low metallicity and thus have unique properties .",
    "it is commonly speculated that population iii stars have a top - heavy imf , with masses ranging from 100 - 1000 m@xmath3   ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "any zero - metallicity star with a mass greater than @xmath8 m@xmath3   will leave a @xmath9 m@xmath3   black hole behind @xcite .",
    "another theory involves the direct collapse of very metal - poor , low - angular momentum gas via dynamical instabilities @xcite .",
    "if enough gas is funneled into the center of a local overdensity , it may collapse to form a black hole with mass @xmath10 m@xmath3   @xcite .",
    "this process may happen later than population iii star formation , because halos must be larger to host such massive inflow .",
    "efficient gas collapse is more likely to occur in massive halos with virial temperatures @xmath11k under metal - free conditions where the formation of h@xmath12 is inhibited by a uv background @xcite , and cooling is dominated by atomic hydrogen . in such halos , fragmentation is suppressed , cooling proceeds gradually , and the gaseous component can cool and participate in mbh formation before it is turned into stars .",
    "these halos may need to exist in regions of ultracritical uv radiation in order to form mbhs by direct collapse @xcite , since the average estimated uv background may not be sufficient to prevent some population iii stars from forming in halos of this size @xcite .    while the processes which may lead to mbh seed formation have been modeled cosmologically @xcite , it is not yet possible to do so in simulations involving volumes larger than a few mpc@xmath13 .",
    "previous large - scale simulations have incorporated seed black hole formation in a simplistic way .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite all employ similar methods , which involves running an on - the - fly halo finder on the simulation as it evolves , and planting seed mbhs in particular halos by hand .",
    "the halos are chosen based on a mass threshold ( generally @xmath14 m@xmath3 ) , and seeds are planted if there is not already a black hole present .",
    "there is no metallicity criterion , so seed mbhs can form at any redshift if a halo meets the eligibility criteria .",
    "the seeds are placed at the center of the halo and generally fixed there throughout the remainder of the simulation @xcite .",
    "however , there is no physical motivation for a halo mass threshold for mbh placement of @xmath15 m@xmath3 , and in fact seeds likely form in halos of much lower mass ( see  [ sect : history ] ) .",
    "this method also prevents more than one seed from forming per halo , which may be unrealistic - halos may experience the formation of multiple population iii stars if fragmentation occurs @xcite .",
    "fixing the black hole at the halo center is similarly inadvisable - dynamical effects such as galaxy mergers or gravitational recoil may cause a black hole to temporarily vacate the exact center of its galaxy , but such a circumstance is prohibited in these models .",
    "the formalism of seed mbh formation we describe in this paper is a more sophisticated and realistic model because it makes no assumptions about the underlying halo properties .",
    "our method relies only on the prospective mbh s local environment to determine when and where the mbh forms , including a requirement for zero - metallicity gas .",
    "our scenario is broadly consistent with either proposed mbh formation mechanism , and also allows mbhs to evolve dynamically in a realistic way .",
    "it is crucial to study how variations in halo mass affect the frequency of formation when examining simulated seed mbh populations , and so we include in our sample a variety of halo masses in order to present a more coherent picture of high-@xmath16 seed formation and evolution as a function of cosmic environment . with this technique ,",
    "we investigate where and when mbh seeds form at high redshift , and discuss the implications for galaxies at @xmath17 .",

    "we employ a suite of simulations with different halo masses to test seed mbh formation .",
    "it is crucial to study how variations in halo mass affect the frequency of formation when examining simulated seed mbh populations .",
    "we have chosen a set of three fiducial halos selected from a uniform resolution , 50 mpc volume and resimulated at high resolution using the volume renormalization technique @xcite .",
    "we sample the region of interest at high resolution , and then sample more coarsely as the distance from the chosen object increases .",
    "this technique results in a large dynamic range , where we can capture the detailed physics of galaxy formation on small scales in the region of interest , and also the large - scale tidal torques from structures several mpc away .",
    "the three chosen halos correspond broadly to a _ low - mass _ disk galaxy ( @xmath20 ) , a _ milky way - mass _ disk galaxy ( @xmath21 ) , and a _ massive elliptical _ galaxy ( @xmath22 ) at @xmath17 .",
    "we present the details of our simulations in table [ table : sims ] .",
    "our simulations are extremely high resolution , with gas particles having masses between @xmath23 m@xmath3 , and a force resultion of 173 - 260 pc , depending on the simulation .",
    "the mass ratio of gas and dark matter particles ( column 4 ) is of order unity , which reduces the effects due to two - body scattering and is critical for keeping mbhs in the centers of their galaxies .",

    "we use the amiga halo finder @xcite to identify galaxy halos based on the overdensity criterion for a flat universe @xcite . for each simulated region",
    ", we analyze mbh populations for the primary halo as well as every satellite with at least 64 particles . in the case of @xmath20",
    "there are 5370 total halos in our analysis ; for @xmath21 there are 5170 ; for @xmath22 there are 2160 .",
    "since the actual physical process of mbh seed formation is unresolvable in cosmological simulations , we have developed a model which is broadly consistent with both of the proposed seed formation scenarios .",
    "the common thread between the proposed scenarios is an ability for gas to collapse into a large central mass , which requires a zero or near - zero metallicity ( though see @xcite for an alternate mechanism ) .",
    "because our star formation prescription is already based on similar physics ( i.e. cold , dense , collapsing gas results in the formation of star particles ) , we use this prescription with the additional criterion of zero metallicity to form seed mbhs .",
    "our current star formation recipe is described in detail in @xcite , and we summarize it here . for a star to form in our simulations , its parent gas particle must meet several criteria .",
    "primarily , the gas density must be greater than the threshold density for star formation , @xmath27 . in simulations with force resolution of @xmath28 100 pc ,",
    "high density peaks can be resolved , mimicking star formation regions in giant molecular clouds @xcite . in this instance",
    ", one can use a realistic value of @xmath27 = 100 amu @xmath29 .",
    "however , at lower resolution we can not properly resolve these high density peaks , and in order to match observed relations such as the kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite and the tully - fisher relation , we use a lower value ( related to the mass and spatial resolution ) for @xmath27 ( 2.5 - 10 amu @xmath29 ) .",
    "these values are presented in table [ table : sims ] for each simulation in our study .",
    "in addition to the density criterion , the gas temperature @xmath30 must be less than a fiducial temperature @xmath31 , which we set to @xmath32 k. star formation efficiency is governed by the free parameter , @xmath33 , which we set to 0.1 @xcite to match the observed relations mentioned above .",
    "if a gas particle meets all of the relevant criteria , the probability it will form a star is given by    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the star and gas particle masses , @xmath37 is the dynamical time for the gas particle , and @xmath38 is the time between star formation episodes , which we set to 1 myr .    for a seed mbh to form ,",
    "all of the criteria for star formation must be met in addition to the criterion of zero metallicity .",
    "if a gas particle meets the criteria to form a star and probabilistically is able to do so , it then has an additional probability to instead form a mbh .",
    "the probability to form a mbh seed is given by the above expression multiplied by the newly introduced parameter @xmath39 , which sets the approximate number of seed mbhs which will form in a given simulation .",
    "in this paper we investigate how varying this parameter affects mbh populations in high redshift galaxies with a range of masses , and explore values of @xmath40 between 0.05 and 0.5 .",
    "this parameter range is motivated by models predicting the efficiency of seed mbh progenitors .",
    "for example , according to @xcite the distribution of halos which might host direct - collapse mbhs varies between 4 - 35% for a reasonable range of halo spins , virial temperatures , and the toomre parameter @xmath41 .",
    "additionally , the population iii star imf reported by @xcite has a mean mass of 250 m@xmath3 , which is roughly the mass where one expects a mbh remnant to form ; therefore @xmath42 of population iii stars may form mbh seeds .",
    "thus we believe our @xmath40 range of 0.05 to 0.5 samples the parameter space of current theoretical predictions .",
    "when seed mbhs do form , they acquire the mass of their parent gas particle . due to resolution limitations",
    ", we can not form mbh seeds with population iii remnant masses ( @xmath9 m@xmath3 ) , but one can imagine a scenario in which pop iii seeds form at high @xmath16 and grow through mergers and accretion to the higher masses we employ in our simulations @xcite .",
    "our seed mass is therefore broadly consistent with either seed formation scenario .",
    "mbhs are allowed to merge if they become close together in space ( within two softening lengths ) and have low relative velocities .",
    "specifically , they must fulfill the criterion @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the differences in velocity and acceleration of the two black holes , and @xmath46 is the distance between them . in this study",
    ", we do not enable mbhs to grow through gas accretion , nor do we include any type of feedback from mbhs .",
    "we have chosen to omit these aspects of mbh physics to gain a robust lower limit on mbh seed populations .",
    "we verified that accretion and feedback do not affect our results by performing a simulation of @xmath21 with the inclusion of these processes ( assuming bondi - hoyle accretion and a feedback efficiency of 1% , see @xcite for more details ) , and found that there were no significant differences in mbh growth or star formation history with their inclusion .",
    "at the high redshifts we are probing here , such mbh activity is only efficient in the largest halos , which are rare in the majority of the simulations we present in this work .",
    "a detailed understanding of the formation history of mbhs , as well as the host halo mass at the time of mbh formation , is essential for interpreting our results . in figure",
    "[ fig : compare ] ( left panel ) we show the formation history of seed mbhs for every resolved halo in each galaxy for @xmath47 .",
    "changing @xmath40 does not qualitatively change the mbh formation history , it simply results in a different number of mbh seeds formed ( higher values of @xmath40 result in increased seed formation and consequently an increased mbh - mbh merger rate - see table [ table : sims ] for the number of mbhs in each simulation at @xmath4 ) . comparing simulations @xmath20 ( green histogram ) and @xmath21 ( red histogram )",
    ", we see the clear trend of an earlier onset of mbh formation with larger overdensities .",
    "the peaks in mbh formation are offset by 200 - 400 myr for simulations @xmath20 and @xmath21 due to this effect of cosmic bias @xcite .",
    "this effect is not evident between simulations @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( purple histogram ) due to the stochastic nature of cosmic large - scale structure .",
    "however , though simulations @xmath22 and @xmath21 begin forming stars and mbhs at the same time , these objects form at a much more rapid rate in @xmath22 due to the overdense nature of the selected region .",
    "the dip at @xmath19 for each simulation is a result of the onset of the uv background at that time , when a subsantial amount of cool gas is heated above @xmath31 . in all galaxies the rate of seed formation dwindles around @xmath4 , because the majority of halos have experienced supernova explosions and have been metal - enriched , which in turn quenches seed mbh formation . at this point",
    ", mbh seeds can only form in areas which have not yet experienced local star formation , which are generally restricted to the outskirts of the simulation .         with @xmath48 = 0.1 .",
    "[ fig : form ] ]    the connection between star formation , metal pollution and mbh formation is exemplified in figure [ fig : form ] . here",
    "we show the cumulative mass fraction of stars and mbhs for all of the galaxies in simulation @xmath21 ( @xmath49 ) . the bulk of the mbhs form while the star formation rate is still quite low .",
    "mbh formation tapers off at @xmath4 , at a time when the star formation rate is increasing rapidly .",
    "these effects are due to the metallicity criterion for seed formation ; mbhs form efficiently only until metals have diffused through the interstellar gas , at which point mbh formation is truncated fairly quickly .",
    "we next examine the mass of a halo at the time a black hole seed forms within it .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare ] ( right panel ) , shows that in our simulations seed mbhs form in halos which are less massive than the @xmath50 m@xmath3   assumed in previous works .",
    "our predicted halo mass range is between @xmath1 and @xmath2 m@xmath3 , with a peak around @xmath51 m@xmath3 , and does not vary with @xmath40 .",
    "( again we show only @xmath47 , the other values of @xmath40 give nearly identical results . )",
    "this halo mass is consistent with that in which population iii stars are expected to form ( @xmath52 m@xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also with the halo mass expected for seed mbh formation via direct collapse scenario ( @xmath53 m@xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this agreement is simply a consequence of the physics of gas cooling in virialized halos ; though we do not include prescriptions for molecular hydrogen cooling or population iii star formation , we find good agreement with predictions of the first collapsing metal - free gas clouds .",
    "the halo mass at time of mbh formation is slightly dependent on the resolution of the simulation in question , in that the distribution shifts toward smaller masses with higher resolution , but this effect is minimal and we do not expect our results to differ strongly if we move to yet higher resolution .",
    "also note that because more than one mbh is allowed to form in a halo , a particular halo may be represented more than once in the right panel of figure 1 .",
    "the halo mass at the time of mbh formation is somewhat dependent on the cosmic overdensity , in that mbh formation ( and star formation in general ) begins earlier in volumes with larger density perturbations .",
    "this phenomenon leads to the earliest onsets of star formation occurring in halos which are slightly smaller than those in less overdense regions .",
    "for the galaxy @xmath22 , the distribution of halos is actually bimodal , with a strong peak around @xmath54 m@xmath3 , and a secondary peak at large halo mass .",
    "the mbhs which form in large halos do so at late times ( after the primary burst of mbh formation ) in the outskirts of the primary halo ( between 20 - 50 physical kpc from the center ) in pockets of very low metallicity .",
    "these mbh formation events may be a resolution effect , as they may be occuring in pressure - confined clouds as reported in @xcite ; with higher resolution ( and a corresponding higher density threshold for star / mbh formation ) these objects may cease to exist .",
    "we plan to explore this effect further with high resolution tests .",
    "however , since these objects form in low density regions , they will exist as `` wandering '' mbhs in the halo and never inspiral to the center to merge with the primary .    allowing mbh seeds to form in halos with",
    "@xmath55 m@xmath3   is vital for capturing their full evolution . while several of these seeds will eventually become central mbhs in large halos at @xmath56 , many may have other fates .",
    "for example , when small halos hosting mbh seeds merge with larger ones , they may undergo tidal stripping , resulting in a `` wandering '' black hole in the larger galaxy halo @xcite .",
    "if the satellite halo is not tidally destroyed , it still may have been stripped of enough baryons to quench the growth of its mbh , resulting in a dwarf galaxy hosting an intermediate mass black hole which may be near its initial seed mass .",
    "the frequency at which mbhs occupy halos is a fundamental measure of mbh seed formation efficiency .",
    "there are constraints on this quantity in the local universe , albeit weak ones ; for example , nuclear activity due to mbhs has been detected in 32% of the late - type galaxies in the virgo cluster , exclusively in galaxies with mass @xmath57 m@xmath3   @xcite .",
    "for early - type galaxies in virgo , nuclear activity exists in 3 - 44% of galaxies with mass less than @xmath15 m@xmath3 , and 49 - 87% of galaxies with mass greater than @xmath15 m@xmath3   @xcite .",
    "such estimates put a lower limit on the mbh occupation fraction of galaxies in this cluster , since inactive black holes are unlikely to be observed .",
    "observations at higher redshifts are more challenging , though data at @xmath58 from deep2 and aegis may help provide some constraints ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the synergy of _ jwst _ and _ alma _ will more robustly probe occupation fractions in distant galaxies",
    ".    theoretical constraints of the mbh occupation fraction are also quite weak .",
    "semi - analytic models show that the occupation fraction varies depending on which method of mbh formation is used @xcite or how efficiently seeds are formed @xcite .",
    "only a few percent of high redshift halos need host mbhs in order to reproduce the @xmath17 occupation fraction @xcite .",
    "however , high - redshift occupation fractions anywhere from 10% to 100% can reproduce the observed quasar luminosity function and smbh mass function , depending on parameters such as radiative efficiency and quasar duty cycle @xcite .",
    "clearly much uncertainty remains regarding the high redshift mbh occupation fraction , and we take this opportunity to explore how halo mass and seed formation efficiency affect this quantity .    in figure [ fig : occupation ] we show the mbh - halo occupation fraction vs. halo mass for the four values of @xmath40 . here",
    "we include the parent galaxy and subhalos of all three simulations together at @xmath4 .",
    "halos with virial masses above log@xmath59 always host a mbh seed , regardless of the value of seed formation efficiency . even in the lowest efficiency case , mbh seeds form in the regions of earliest star formation , which tend to be the halos which become the most massive later on in every simulation .",
    "the most massive halos have also experienced the greatest number of mergers , which further populates them with mbh seeds brought in by satellites .",
    "thus , our model predicts that halos with masses greater than @xmath60 m@xmath3   will be extremely likely to host mbh seeds , even if the formation efficiency of such seeds is small .",
    "this result is consistent with observations of the local universe , where mbhs are found to occupy halos above a similar mass threshold with high likelihood @xcite . to estimate the fate of mbhs at later cosmic times",
    ", we have run a lower - resolution simulation of galaxy @xmath21 to @xmath17 and traced the mass evolution of halos .",
    "halos with mass between @xmath1 m@xmath3   and @xmath15 m@xmath3   at @xmath4 can remain in the same mass range at @xmath61 , be stripped , or become incorporated in the main halo . in this particular case , @xmath62 30% of halos with @xmath63 m@xmath3    that host mbhs already at @xmath4 ",
    "are stripped during their evolution , ending up as halos with @xmath17 masses of @xmath64 m@xmath3 .",
    "while one zoomed - in simulation can not give us broad statistics on the evolution of all @xmath4 halos , we can deduce that while a large number of high redshift mbh hosts undergo hierarchical merging and settle in massive galaxies , a non - negligible fraction have more quiescent merger histories and do not grow substantially , and make up today s population of low - mass galaxies which may harbor mbhs .    .",
    "colored lines and symbols represent simulations with different values of @xmath40 ( red triangles : @xmath65 , blue asterisks : @xmath47 , green diamonds : @xmath66,black crosses : @xmath67 ) .",
    "error bars represent uncertainty due to poisson statistics .",
    "the horizontal dot - dashed line marks where the probability that a galaxy hosts a mbh is 50% , corresponding to halo masses between @xmath51 and @xmath2m@xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : occupation ] ]    on the other hand , the occupation fraction of halos with masses less than @xmath60 m@xmath3   is sensitive to the physics of mbh formation , via @xmath40 .",
    "for example , in galaxies @xmath21 and @xmath22 , halos with mass @xmath68 m@xmath3   are nearly 100% likely to host a mbh seed if @xmath67 , but only 10% likely when @xmath65 .",
    "the dependence of occupation fraction with @xmath40 becomes weaker in galaxy @xmath20 , however .",
    "we suggest that in the larger halos , metals diffuse throughout the simulation more efficiently ( due to increased star formation and possible ejection of metals from galaxies ) which suppresses mbh formation in their satellites . in the isolated low - mass disk galaxy",
    ", however , the relative lack of metal diffusion allows mbhs to continue forming in these halos at a time when mbh formation would have been truncated in a larger overdensity . in this study",
    "we have aimed for high resolution with a sample of field galaxies ; for a simulated uniform volume , including voids and high density regions ( which more completely samples halos in the universe ) our results may be slightly different",
    ". however , a test study using a small ( 6 mpc ) uniform volume gives results consistent with our findings here .",
    "we have undertaken a study of the formation and evolution of seed mbhs using cosmological simulations , including a unique and physically motivated recipe for seed mbh formation . in our simulations ,",
    "mbh formation depends solely on the local properties of the surrounding gas ( i.e. density , temperature , metallicity ) rather than on global halo properties .",
    "we can thus model the evolution of mbh seeds within their halos in a cosmological framework in a fully self - consistent way .",
    "we find that mbhs form in a burst during the onset of the earliest star formation , but the formation rate tapers off by @xmath4 due to the diffusion of metals throughout the intergalactic medium .",
    "mbh formation is concentrated in halos with masses between @xmath1 and @xmath2 m@xmath3 , consistent with predictions of seed supermassive black hole formation @xcite .",
    "mbhs which exist in small halos at high redshift may contribute to the @xmath56 population of `` wandering '' black holes in massive galaxies , or they may appear as intermediate mass black holes in low mass and/or bulgeless galaxies @xcite if their hosts have quiescent merger histories .",
    "we find that the time of black hole formation and the occupation fraction of black holes are a function of the host halo mass .",
    "large halos form mbhs earlier and they are more likely to host a mbh .",
    "an observational determination the mbh - halo occupation fraction for halos of mass @xmath69 m@xmath3   would be a strong constraint on the true formation efficiency of mbh seeds ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a forthcoming paper we will investigate the co - evolution of mbhs and galaxies at later cosmic times , as well as derive both the occupation fraction and the active fraction of mbhs in galaxies .",
    "the latter is a direct observational constraint ; a preliminary study of the active fraction at @xmath70 is already possible now with data from deep2 and aegis , while local high sensitivity studies are being carried for both field galaxies ( miller et al . in prep ) and in the virgo cluster @xcite .    it may be possible that some mbhs could form at even lower redshifts in halos near cosmic voids .",
    "since these areas have below - average densities , they will have experienced far less star formation and thus will have a lower metallicity than their high - density counterparts .",

    "<S> our simulations explain why massive black holes are found in some bulgeless and dwarf galaxies , but we also predict that their occurrence becomes rarer and rarer in low - mass systems . </S>"
