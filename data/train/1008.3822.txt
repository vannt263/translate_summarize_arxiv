    "with the extended energy range and the increased precision of recent accelerators , it is now possible to probe the electromagnetic structure of baryon resonances beyond the first resonance region .",
    "for example , the facilities like clas ( jefferson lab ) , mami ( mainz ) , elsa ( boon ) , legs ( brookhaven ) , bates ( mit ) and spring-8 ( japan ) , are able to measure the electromagnetic transition properties associated with the resonances such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16  @xcite .    to accommodate the data with higher four - momentum transfer squared @xmath8 and center - of - mass energy @xmath17 , an improvement of the data analysis is mandatory , since more baryons and mesons emerge in the possible intermediate states .",
    "then , the exact identification of the resonances easily becomes controversial due to a large number of channels taking place in a very small energy range .",
    "furthermore , the analysis made by various groups , maid  @xcite , said  @xcite , jlab - yeveran  @xcite jlms ( jlab - moscow )  @xcite , bonn - gatchina @xcite , valencia  @xcite , giessen  @xcite , cmb  @xcite and ksu  @xcite , are based on different resonance poles and meson - baryon coupling constants .",
    "a similar situation exists also for the dynamical coupled - channel reaction models , e.g. , mainz - taipei  @xcite , jlich  @xcite and ebac  @xcite models .",
    "one of the most known issues which drives them to study the baryon resonances is `` missing resonance problem '' , that is , several states predicted by quark models have not yet been observed nor identified by experiments  @xcite .    under such circumstances any theoretical studies for the baryon resonances would help to uncover their properties .",
    "for example , @xmath1 , the first excited state of @xmath18 , may be one of such interesting resonances worth while to study .",
    "it has not yet been studied well so far . according to the particle data group ( pdg )",
    "@xcite @xmath1 is a three - star resonance which decays preferentially to @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "although the form factors associated with the electroproduction of this resonance were studied some time ago by a constituent quark model  @xcite , it is only recent that this resonance has been included in meson - baryon reaction analysis models  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments show that the @xmath1 resonance can be very important in double pion production in nucleon - nucleon collisions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 resonance was also studied in lattice qcd simulations  @xcite and qcd sum rules  @xcite .",
    "although the experimental access for the @xmath1 resonance is still insufficient , it is very interesting to study it theoretically by the following reasons .",
    "similarly to its ground state @xmath2 , @xmath1 can be described as a quark core dressed by meson cloud in the low @xmath8 region .",
    "however , contrarily to the @xmath2 case , meson cloud structure for the @xmath1 is expected to be much richer , since more meson - baryon channels are associated with it  @xcite . to estimate the meson - baryon dressing for the @xmath1",
    ", one can in principle use a dynamical coupled - channel models , but it is also necessary to understand the three - quark core structure based on the underlying physics of qcd , instead of using a phenomenological parametrization .",
    "thus , the use of a quark model , which includes the degrees of freedom that dominate in the intermediate and higher @xmath8 region generally , is a natural consequence .",
    "quark models have also proven to be very useful in the studies of nucleon and @xmath2 systems .",
    "in this article we study the structure of @xmath1 and the @xmath0 transition , by applying a covariant spectator constituent quark model  @xcite . in this model",
    "one can naturally assume that the @xmath1 as the first radial excitation of @xmath2 , similarly to the case of @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath1 resonance as the first radial excitation of @xmath2 is sufficient for the present approach to estimate the valence quark contributions for the @xmath0 transition .",
    "no extra parameters are required",
    ". however , the transitions @xmath3 and @xmath0 , are very different with respect to the pion cloud effects",
    ". while the pion cloud contributions are about 30 - 45% for the transition with the @xmath2 , the pion cloud contributions would be more significant for the transition with the @xmath1 .",
    "this is due to the increase of relevant intermediate states , @xmath4 , @xmath21 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    before discussing any details of the numerical results , we can state that , solely from the quark core contributions , the magnetic dipole transition form factors in the @xmath0 transition at @xmath12 is negative ( @xmath22 ) , and significantly undershoot the experimental data ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "however , with the inclusion of the pion cloud contributions which are dominant in the low @xmath8 region , the final result approaches to the experimental data points .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secreaction ] general remarks are given for the @xmath24 transitions , and the theoretical background is introduced . in secs .",
    "[ secvalence ] and  [ secpion ] contributions from the valence quarks and pion cloud are respectively discussed for the @xmath0 transition . in sec .",

    "the electromagnetic transition between a spin 1/2 baryon ( e.g. , nucleon ) and a spin 3/2 baryon ( e.g. , @xmath18 ) with the positive parity , can be described in terms of three independent form factors introduced by jones and scadron  @xcite : @xmath25 ( magnetic dipole ) , @xmath26 ( electric quadrupole ) and @xmath27 ( coulomb quadrupole ) .",
    "an example is the @xmath3 transition .",
    "it is well established that the @xmath3 transition is dominated by the magnetic dipole form factor , @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "this can be easily understood in a naive su(6 ) quark model , since @xmath2 can be regarded as a system which one quark spin is flipped from the nucleon system , therefore possible by a pure magnetic dipole transition . in fact , the magnetic dipole form factor , @xmath25 , emerges naturally as a dominant form factor when only s - state structure in the quark - diquark system is included for the @xmath2 wave function , and all the remaining form factors vanish  @xcite . although d - states can contribute to the transition , they induce only small corrections for @xmath25 , besides the contribution for the quadrupole form factors , which are also small when compared with @xmath25  @xcite .    however , it is well known that only the valence quark contributions are insufficient to describe the @xmath3 transition  @xcite . the pion cloud contributions , which a photon couples to the intermediate pion - baryon states , must also be included additionally to the valence quark contributions  @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 transition form factor @xmath25 , may be split into two contributions , g_m^(q^2)= g_m^b(q^2 ) + g_m^(q^2 ) , [ eqgm ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the contributions from the quark core ( also will be denoted by `` bare '' ) , and those from the pion cloud , respectively .",
    "the above separation is justified if the pion is created by the baryon of a three - quark system , and not by a single quark inside the baryon . also , according to the chiral perturbation theory , heavy meson loops are suppressed , and the processes with one pion loop are dominant in the low @xmath8 region  @xcite .",
    "thus , we restrict the pion - baryon intermediate states to the lowest order , namely , `` one pion in the air '' in the following .    with the decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ eqgm ] ) , we can separate the short - range contributions that are sensitive to the quark structure ( @xmath28 )  @xcite , and those of the long - range which depend on the pion cloud ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we note that the same decomposition eq .",
    "( [ eqgm ] ) was also applied in several works  @xcite .    to estimate the quark core contributions @xmath28 ,",
    "one needs a microscopic quark model of baryons . as for the pion cloud contributions @xmath29",
    ", one can use a long - range effective dynamics in the low @xmath8 region based on chiral symmetry . according to chiral perturbation theory the two regimes can not in general be disentangled  @xcite .",
    "that separation is possible only in a specific formalism , provided that the scale of the quark core is defined .    in the covariant spectator quark model @xmath30",
    "was calculated for the @xmath3 transition by the processes which a photon directly couples to the constituent quarks  @xcite . here , the overlap integral between the nucleon and @xmath18 scalar wave functions played an important role  @xcite , as will be also discussed in sec .",
    "[ secvalence ] . the model for the @xmath2 structure",
    "was calibrated by the core contributions of the sato - lee model by switching off the pion cloud effects  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the model was successfully able to reproduce the quenched lattice qcd data @xcite for heavy pions , where the pion cloud effects are known to be small  @xcite .",
    "these facts give us some confidence that the valence quark contributions of the model are well under control .",
    "to describe the @xmath0 transition , we use the same formalism which was successfully applied to study the @xmath3 transition  @xcite and @xmath2 elastic form factors  @xcite . as the @xmath1 resonance shares many common properties with the @xmath2 resonance such as spin and isospin ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the @xmath1 as the first radial excitation of the @xmath2 , and that it can also be described by a s - state approximation .",
    "then , one can determine the @xmath1 wave function completely by the orthogonality condition to that of the @xmath2 .",
    "using the @xmath1 wave function determined in this way and the nucleon wave function determined in the previous study  @xcite , we can estimate the valence quark contributions for the transition magnetic dipole form factor , @xmath28 , for the @xmath0 transition .",
    "the detail will be given in next section .",
    "on the other hand , the pion cloud contributions ( @xmath29 ) for the @xmath3 transition in the spectator formalism was estimated using an effective parametrization  @xcite .",
    "the parametrization is consistent with the pion cloud contributions derived from the dynamical meson - baryon coupled - channel models of sato - lee  @xcite , and mainz - taipei  @xcite .",
    "the relative contributions of the pion cloud ( @xmath31 ) are simulated by a dipole form factor which suppresses the pion cloud contributions in the high @xmath8 region . to take account of the pion cloud contributions @xmath29 in the @xmath0 transition",
    ", we must include more pion - baryon intermediate states than for the @xmath3 transition .",
    "the detailed discussions concerning the pion cloud effects are given in sec .",
    "[ secpion ] .    in the present work we adopt a hybrid approach to study the @xmath0 transition , which was successfully applied for the @xmath3 transition .",
    "this hybrid approach has the following advantages .",
    "it can explain why the bare contributions are insufficient to describe the electromagnetic transition form factors .",
    "furthermore , it provides a simple parametrization for @xmath28 that can not be derived from usual dynamical coupled - channel models .",
    "finally , it can also incorporate the pion cloud effects which is justified by dynamical coupled - channel models , and essential to describe the @xmath3 transition .",

    "unfortunately , we can not draw more definite conclusions , since the uncertainty associated with the pion cloud contributions is @xmath153 , which is comparable with the central value @xmath154 , and also relatively large experimental errors exist .",

    "a better constraint of the pion cloud contribution can be achieved once better experimental data become available associated with the @xmath86 decay to extract @xmath155 .",

    "the method used to estimate the pion cloud contributions is based on the processes that a photon couples directly to the pion , which may be justified by the previous study for the octet baryon magnetic moments in the same covariant spectator quark model , within about a 10% error . then , based on the cloudy bag model formalism , we have made a connection for the pion cloud contributions between the @xmath3 and @xmath0 transitions , by summing over all the intermediate spin and isospin states . in this exploratory study",
    ", we have approximated the masses of all the intermediate state baryons by an average value of the @xmath20 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath1 . in the future",
