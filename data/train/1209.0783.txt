    "in the astrophysical universe , neutron stars ( nss ) are often surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "several observations of x - ray binaries have indicated the presence of nss in binary systems in which the ns accretes from the less - compact companion ( e.g. , @xcite ) . furthermore , isolated nss are likely to be surrounded by a fallback disk remnant of the supernova explosion ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while numerical simulations have shown that the accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of a white dwarf may lead to an ns surrounded by a disk with mass up to @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "even if the ns has initially a mass below the maximum limit , it can soon become unstable to gravitational collapse by accreting matter from the surrounding disk .",
    "such aic to a spinning black hole ( bh ) could be a powerful source of gravitational waves ( gws ) , especially if the accreting matter excites non - axisymmetric modes in the ns before collapse .",
    "to date , no studies of such sources have been reported in full general relativity . on the other hand ,",
    "the collapse of nss ( in vacuum ) to bhs has been the subject of several investigations , including the accurate extraction of the gw signals emitted by these sources  @xcite .",
    "all these simulations have shown that the collapse is essentially axisymmetric and that no torus is left behind after the creation of a spinning bh .",
    "because of this , the gw signals emitted by these sources will be rather weak and detectable only by advanced ligo and virgo if the sources were located in our galaxy .",
    "third generation detectors , such as the planned einstein telescope , could instead detect some of these sources up to a distance of @xmath3 mpc  @xcite .",
    "the aic of an ns to a bh has also been suggested to be behind the central engine of short gamma - ray bursts ( grbs , e.g. , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is that an ns in a low - mass binary system could accrete enough mass from the companion star to produce a spinning bh surrounded by an accretion disk massive enough to power a relativistic jet and hence a short grb .    here",
    "we present the first numerical simulations describing the aic of an ns to bh via fully three - dimensional general relativistic simulations .",
    "we follow the collapse of three initial ns configurations , each with and without an accreting torus , and study the impact of the accreting material on the dynamics of the collapse and its imprint on the gw signal , as well as the post - collapse evolution of the disk . given that this is the first of such studies , we consider non - magnetized nss .",
    "we also note that , while we do not expect magnetic fields to have a strong impact during the collapse ( because , even when considering highly magnetized nss , the ratio of magnetic to gas pressure is much lower than one ) , they can have an important role after bh formation since they may extract energy from the system and power relativistic jets  @xcite .",

    "the dynamics of the collapse is reported in section  [ dynamics ] , while the gw signal emitted during the aic event is described in section  [ gws ] , followed by a discussion ( section  [ em ] ) of possible electromagnetic ( em ) counterparts .",
    "we finally summarize and conclude in section  [ conclusions ] .    throughout this letter",
    "we use a spacelike signature of @xmath39 and a system of units in which @xmath40 ( unless specified otherwise ) .",
    "the initial data are built using the codes ` rns ` @xcite and ` torero ` ( @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , the uniformly rotating ns models are built using the numerical code ` rns `  with a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are pressure and rest - mass density , respectively , while @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the polytropic constant and the polytropic exponent , respectively .",
    "all the initial models are chosen to be on the unstable branch  @xcite in order to be able to compare the gw signal between a collapsing ns with and without a torus . in the former case",
    "we assume that the torus has already accreted enough mass on the ns to make it unstable , and we follow its dynamics after that point .",
    "the ns collapse is triggered by reducing its pressure by @xmath46 at the beginning of the simulations .",
    "when we add an accretion disk to the rotating ns , we use the code ` torero ` , which can compute stationary solutions of axisymmetric disks around spinning bhs by solving the equations described in  @xcite and  @xcite . in these equations the self - gravity of the disk is neglected and hence they are valid only when the mass of the disk is sufficiently small compared to the mass of the central compact object .",
    "we note that , even if the torus is built assuming the spacetime of a spinning bh , the violation of the hamiltonian constraint introduced by having the torus orbiting around a spinning ns is not large enough to affect the dynamics of the system .",
    "this is due to the fact that the tori considered here have masses which are a small fraction of the mass of the ns .",
    "we have further verified that this violation decreases with increasing resolution and that it is negligible compared to the violations introduced during the evolution ( i.e. , the infinity norm of the hamiltonian constraint is similar during the collapse between the models with and without torus ) .",
    "furthermore , the initial violation produced by adding the torus produces a spurious burst of radiation that leaves the grid well before the beginning of the collapse and hence it does not contaminate the gw signal computed from these models .",
    "the tori are built by giving as input parameters to ` torero ` the gravitational mass @xmath47 and the ratio of angular momentum to gravitational mass , @xmath48 , of the ns , and two parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 which define , respectively , the initial value of the constant angular momentum in the disk and the depth level reached by the disk inside the potential well .",
    "a negative value of @xmath50 represents a stable solution , while a positive value would give a torus overflowing its roche lobe .",
    "table  [ tab : id ] lists the relevant properties of the nss and tori studied here . we have chosen tori with masses @xmath51 of the mass of the ns in order to have a non - negligible effect on the dynamics .    the evolution of these ns / torus configurations is computed using the fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic code ` whisky `  @xcite , which adopts a flux - conservative formulation of the equations and high - resolution shock - capturing schemes .",
    "all the results presented here have been obtained by means of the piecewise parabolic method , while the harten - lax - van leer - einfeldt approximate riemann solver has been used to compute the fluxes  @xcite .",
    "all the simulations were performed using an ideal - fluid eos with @xmath45 .",
    "magnetic field effects were not included in these simulations and they will be the subject of future work .",
    "the evolution of the spacetime was obtained using the ` ccatie ` code , a three - dimensional finite - differencing code providing the solution of a conformal traceless formulation of the einstein equations  @xcite .",
    "both the ` ccatie ` and ` whisky ` codes benefit of the use of the einstein toolkit  @xcite .",
    "the simulations were run using the vertex - centered fixed mesh - refinement approach provided by the ` carpet ` driver  @xcite .",
    "we have used seven refinement levels with the finest resolution being @xmath52 and the coarsest resolution being @xmath53 .",
    "the finest grid has a radius of @xmath54 ( which is sufficient to completely cover the ns ) , whereas the coarsest grid extends to @xmath55 .",
    "for all the simulations reported here we have also used a reflection - symmetry condition across the @xmath56 plane and a @xmath57-symmetry condition across the @xmath58 plane and apply a @xmath59-rotational - symmetry boundary condition across the plane at @xmath58 . ] .    [",

    "figure  [ fig : psi4 ] displays the gw signal emitted by the aic of an ns to a bh in our six models , and in particular the dominant @xmath60 mode computed using the weyl scalar @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the blue solid lines refer to the cases without a torus , while the red dashed lines show the signal emitted when the torus is present .",
    "since the collapse is essentially axisymmetric , @xmath60 is the dominant mode , and the signal is given by an exponential increase followed by the ring - down of the bh .",
    "no significant difference can be seen in the signal between the models with and without a torus , except for the fact that the gws emitted by the models with a torus show some small oscillations before the collapse .",
    "these are related to the ns oscillations triggered by the accretion of the disk , as previously mentioned in section  [ dynamics ] .",
    "similarly to the case of the collapse of an ns in vacuum , the gw emission would be detectable by advanced ligo / virgo only if the sources were located in our galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , with the einstein telescope , the signal could be detected for sources at distances of up to @xmath3 mpc .",
    "as described in section  [ dynamics ] , the presence of a rapidly accreting torus left around the newly born bh is a distinctive feature of the aic , differentiating it from the direct collapse of an ns into a bh , which leaves no mass for the bh to accrete from .",
    "the accretion rates that our aic events predict ( cf . figure  [ fig : mass ] ) , on the order of @xmath62 , are within an order of magnitude of those obtained in the merger of two nss ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for a typical mass - to - energy conversion efficiency @xmath63 ,",
    "these aics have luminosities sufficiently high to constitute enticing candidates for short grbs .",
    "in fact , assuming an energy - to-@xmath64-ray conversion efficiency @xmath65 several tens of percent ( as expected for short grbs , e.g. , @xcite ) , our simulated aic events would have peak luminosities in @xmath64-rays on the order of @xmath66  erg  s@xmath67 , compatible with at least a fraction of short grbs .",
    "clearly , the predicted accretion rates are dependent on the torus mass , and a more comprehensive exploration will be performed in future work .",
    "short grbs from the aic of an ns in a binary are envisioned to have the observer located out of the binary plane  @xcite , and a jet launched along the ns rotation axis  either as the result of @xmath68 annihilation ( e.g. , @xcite ) or of magnetohydrodynamic effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; furthermore , they are expected to be more often found in early - type or globular cluster environments @xcite .",
    "a detailed computation of their expected cosmological rates , and a comparison with the observed population of short grbs , is reserved for future work .",
    "in particular , we will examine the dependence of the aic accretion rates on the disk mass , and hence assess the likelihood of their occurrence in x - ray binaries ( where disk masses are smaller than the ones considered here ) and fallback disks around isolated nss ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "finally , within the connection short grbs / aic events , we further note that the observed x - ray flares  @xcite and extended emissions  @xcite , lasting up to several hundreds of seconds , can not be directly explained as the result of activity from the central engine ( which in an aic is much shorter than the flare duration ) , unless the disk undergoes some instability ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have performed the first three - dimensional , fully general relativistic simulation of the aic of an ns to a bh ; we have examined the gw signal expected from such events , and computed the accretion rates onto the newly formed bh .",
    "we find that the main component ( @xmath69 mode ) of the gw signal is very similar to the one from the collapse of an ns into a bh in vacuum .",
    "however , and most importantly , while the direct collapse of a non - magnetized ns onto a bh leaves no mass behind ( hence making unlikely the presence of any em detectable counterpart ) , an aic is followed by rapid accretion of the disk onto the newly formed bh .",
    "our computed accretion rates , comparable to those obtained in simulations of ns - ns mergers , make aic events potential engines for short grbs .",
    "nss in x - ray binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) , isolated nss accreting from fallback disks  @xcite , and nss produced by the aic of a white dwarf  @xcite are astrophysical scenarios which might host the aic of an ns onto a bh .",
