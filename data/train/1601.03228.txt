    "the discovery of high temperature fe - based superconductors(fescs ) is a major breakthrough in condensed matter physics field@xcite . since their great application prospect",
    ", lots of theoretical and experimental researches have been devoted to study the fescs @xcite .",
    "there is an increasing diversity of superconducting materials and more complicated characteristics .",
    "nevertheless , the mechanism of fescs has not been confirmed thoroughly .",
    "iron - pnicitides usually contain both hole and electron pockets which are separated with momentum @xmath6 in 2-fe brillouin zone(bz ) .",
    "theoretically , @xmath3-wave@xcite , which displays a sign change between the superconducting orders on hole pockets and electron pockets , is the most promising candidate .",
    "however , once the fermi surfaces change , @xmath3 is not the leading instability in many theoretical studies .",
    "for example , in the fescs with only electron pockets , such as most iron - chalcogenides@xcite , or only hole pockets @xcite , the @xmath0-wave pairing channel is favored in most theoretical studies based on spin fluctuation mechanism and standard weak coupling treatments@xcite .",
    "in addition , orbital dependent sign change @xmath1-wave@xcite , @xmath7@xcite with sign - reversal between hole pockets , @xmath8-pairing @xmath1-wave@xcite and time - reversal symmetry breaking states including @xmath9 state@xcite and @xmath10 state@xcite have been proposed theoretically .    while most weak coupling approaches have targeted on the change of pairing symmetries depending on the variations of fermi surfaces ,",
    "the relationship between interaction parameters and pairing symmetries has not been well explored . in our paper based on functional renormalization group(frg ) @xcite , an unbiased weak coupling approach , we systematically investigate the effect of interaction parameters on pairing symmetries in a fixed fermi surface topology that exhibits both hole and electron pockets @xcite .",
    "we consider interactions including intra - orbital coulomb coupling @xmath11 , inter - orbital coulomb coupling @xmath12 , hund s coupling @xmath13 , pairing hopping term @xmath14 , nearest - neighbour(nn ) antiferromagnetic(afm ) exchange coupling @xmath4 , and next - nearest - neighbour(nnn ) afm exchange coupling @xmath5 .",
    "we calculate the phase diagrams of the leading superconducting instability . it is found that depending on interaction parameters , all @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 phases can be emerged within the reasonable interaction regions .",
    "this result suggests that the theoretical predicting power from this current theoretical method is rather limited as it is difficult to extract accurate effective microscopic interaction parameters for complex systems such as iron - based superconductors .",
    "we use the frg method to analyze the pairing symmetry with different types of interactions .",
    "frg is a numerical calculation method for weak to moderate electron correlation systems . as it takes into account all virtual two - electron scattering processes and calculates all the electronic instabilities without bias , frg is considered to be a resultful method in calculating the instabilities and pairing symmetries of materials .",
    "the results of frg are known to be sensitive to fermi surface topology and the details of fermi surfaces properties . moreover",
    ", these results also closely rely on the initial type and value of interactions , which is the central focus of this paper . for the sake of convenience of numerical calculation ,",
    "we discretize the momenta by dividing the bz into @xmath17 patches@xcite , here @xmath18 , and each patch contains one fermi surface segment .",
    "so in the numerical process , we treat the particle momentum with the patch index .",
    "approximately , we regard the coupling function as a constant in each patch and ignore the frequency dependence of the vertex function and the self - energy@xcite .",
    "more specifically , frg mainly outputs the effective interaction as the momentum continually tends to the fermi surface .",
    "the form of four - particle effective interaction is @xmath19 where @xmath20 exhibits a four - point interaction vertex with the incoming and outgoing momenta @xmath21 , here we label these particles with the discrete fermi surface patches ; @xmath22 denote the corresponding band indexes of the four particles and @xmath23 are spin indexes .",
    "the energy cutoff @xmath24 is the frg flow parameter which makes the energy finally approach around the fermi surface .",
    "apparently , for the superconducting channel @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the four - point function becomes @xmath27 .",
    "we rewrite the function into eigen - mode , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the decomposition index .",
    "the leading instability of the superconducting channel corresponds to the eigenvalue @xmath30 which is the most diverging one as the decreasing of @xmath24 , and the homologous form factor @xmath31 tells us the detailed information of superconducting order parameter , the pairing symmetry and the gap structure .",
    "we adopt the band structure of the optimally doped 122-iron - pnictides .",
    "the band structure is described by a five - orbital tight - binding model@xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 stand for the five fe @xmath0 orbitals , @xmath34 stands for spin , @xmath35 is the kinetic term , @xmath36 is the onsite energy , @xmath37 creates an electron with spin @xmath34 and momentum @xmath38 in orbital @xmath39 .",
