    "in spite of the fact that the first paper devoted to the quantum mechanics on a circle is most probably the article by condon on the quantum pendulum , dated 1928 [ 1 ] , the coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle have been introduced only recently [ 2,3 ] .",
    "no wonder that there is also not any example of quantum deformations of these states so far .",
    "we recall that the @xmath0-deformation of the standard coherent states was constructed fifteen years ago in [ 4 ] .",
    "the need for such deformations is motivated , among others , by the importance of the non - deformed coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a circle , which have been already applied for example in quantum gravity [ 5 ] . in this work",
    "we introduce the @xmath0-generalization of the coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle .",
    "we first recall the basic facts about the quantum mechanics on a circle .",
    "consider a free particle on a circle @xmath1 . according to [ 2 ] , the best candidate to represent",
    "the position of a particle on the unit circle is the unitary operator @xmath2 ( @xmath3 hermitian ) satisfying the following commutation rule with the hermitian angular momentum operator @xmath4 : @xmath5 = u.\\ ] ] in the hilbert space @xmath6 of @xmath7-periodic functions , specified by the scalar product @xmath8 the operators @xmath9 and @xmath4 act as follows : @xmath10 and @xmath11 consider now the eigenvalue equation @xmath12 demanding the time - reversal invariance of representations of ( 1.1 ) we have only two possibilities left : @xmath13 integer and @xmath13 half - integer [ 2 ] . in this work",
    "we restrict for simplicity to the case of integer @xmath13 . using ( 1.1 )",
    "one finds that the operators @xmath9 and @xmath14 are the ladder operators such that @xmath15 projecting ( 1.6@xmath16 ) on the eigenvector @xmath17 of @xmath9 satisfying @xmath18 we get @xmath19 of course , the vectors @xmath20 are the basis vectors in the representation space @xmath6 .",
    "we finally write down the orthogonality and completeness conditions satisfied by the vectors @xmath21 of the form @xmath22",
    "we now recall the construction of ( non - deformed ) coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle described in [ 2 ] , where the coherent states @xmath23 for a quantum particle on a circle , are introduced as the solution of the eigenvalue equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 the convenient parametrization of @xmath26 consistent with the form ( 2.2 ) of the operator @xmath27 is @xmath28 we point out that the parametrization ( 2.3 ) relies on the deformation of the cylinder ( the phase space ) specified by @xmath29 and then projecting the points of the obtained surface onto the @xmath30 ( complex ) plane .",
    "evidently , we then identify the points of the cylinder with the plane with extracted point @xmath31 ( the origin ) .",
    "the projection of the vectors @xmath32 onto the basis vectors @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 making use of the parameters @xmath35 , and @xmath36 we can write ( 2.5 ) in the following equivalent form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "the coherent states are not orthogonal .",
    "the overlap integral is [ 2 ] @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the jacobi theta - function [ 6 ] .",
    "we first introduce a @xmath0-deformation of the algebra ( 1.1 ) .",
    "the general deformation of the quantum mechanics on a circle was considered in [ 7 ] . in this work",
    "we consider a @xmath0-deformation of the algebra ( 1.1 ) generated only by @xmath9 , @xmath42 and the identity operator , of the form @xmath43 where @xmath9 is a unitary operator representing the position of a quantum particle on a circle .",
    "we also restrict to the case of @xmath44 . the fact that @xmath0 is real follows directly from ( 3.1 ) and the assumed hermicity of @xmath42 and unitarity of @xmath9 .",
    "now , it can be easily verified that the @xmath0-deformed angular momentum satisfying ( 3.1 ) is an element of the enveloping algebra of ( 1.1 ) such that @xmath45 while @xmath9 remains undeformed . clearly , @xmath42 acts on the basis vectors @xmath21 as follows : @xmath46_q |j\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath47_q=\\frac{q^j-1}{q-1}$ ] is a quantum integer .",
    "furthermore , using ( 1.4 ) and ( 3.2 ) we find that the action of the operator @xmath42 in @xmath6 is of the following form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 designates the jackson derivative defined by @xmath50 and we utilized the fact that in the discussed case of @xmath6 spanned by the functions @xmath51 , where @xmath13 is an integer , a @xmath7-periodic function of @xmath52 is assumed to have the fourier series expansion and it can be considered as a function of @xmath53 . furthermore , taking into account ( 3.2 ) we get @xmath54 = -{\\rm i}\\ln q\\,j_q - { \\rm i}\\frac{\\ln q}{q-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath55 .",
    "we remark that the commutator ( 3.6 ) is nontrivially defined except of the case @xmath56 [ 8 ] .",
    "now we are in a position to define @xmath0-deformed coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a circle . proceeding analogously as in the case of non - deformed coherent states discussed in the previous section we define the @xmath0-deformed coherent states as a solution of the eigenvalue equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 using ( 3.6 ) we find",
    "after some calculation @xmath59 taking into account ( 3.7 ) , ( 3.9 ) , ( 3.3 ) and ( 1.6@xmath16 ) we get @xmath60 now , the form of the operator ( 3.8 ) and ( 2.3 ) indicate the following parametrization of a complex number @xmath61 : @xmath62_q+{\\rm i}\\alpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath63_q=\\frac{q^l-1}{q-1}$ ] , where @xmath35 is a real number , is quantum @xmath35 . it should be noted that for @xmath64 , @xmath63_q$ ] is an increasing function of @xmath35 and it has an upper bound @xmath65 approached in the limit @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , ( see ( 2.4 ) ) in the case of @xmath64 , we identify the points of the @xmath0-deformed classical phase space with the @xmath30 plane with extracted disk @xmath67 .",
    "evidently , this disk reduces to the point @xmath31 , i.e.  the origin , in the limit @xmath68 referring to the non - deformed case . in the case of @xmath69 , @xmath63_q$ ] is also an increasing function and it has a lower bound @xmath70 reached in the limit @xmath71 .",
    "therefore in this case we identify the points of the deformed classical phase space with the disk @xmath72 , with extracted point @xmath31 .",
    "obviously , in the limit @xmath68 corresponding to the non - deformed case , the disk is simply the plane @xmath30 with extracted origin .    using ( 3.11 )",
    "we can write ( 3.10 ) in the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 , and @xmath61 referring via ( 3.7 ) to @xmath75 , is given by ( 3.11 )",
    ". clearly , the relation ( 2.6 ) refers to the limit @xmath68 in ( 3.12 ) .",
    "we recall that the functions ( 2.6 ) span the bargmann representation [ 2 ] .",
    "the problem of finding the bargmann representation in the discussed case of the @xmath0-deformed coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle is complicated and it will be discussed in a separate work .    the coherent states are not orthogonal . indeed , making use of ( 3.12 ) and ( 1.10 ) we find @xmath76 in the limit @xmath68 we recover from ( 3.13 ) the following formula [ 2 ] : @xmath77 it follows immediately from ( 3.13 ) that the discussed coherent states are not normalized .",
    "namely , we have @xmath78 for @xmath56 this relation reduces to @xmath79 one can easily check that the series ( 3.15 ) is convergent for arbitrary ( positive ) @xmath0 and ( finite ) @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , by virtue of the schwartz s inequality the series ( 3.13 ) is also convergent for arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath35 .",
    "we finally write down the formula on the coherent states in @xmath6 following directly from ( 1.8 ) , ( 1.10 ) and ( 3.12 ) such that @xmath80 in the limit @xmath68 this formula takes the form @xmath81 notice that in view of ( 3.14 ) , ( 3.16 ) and ( 3.18 ) the series from the right - hand side of ( 3.13 ) , ( 3.15 ) and ( 3.17 ) , respectively , can be regarded as @xmath0-deformations of the jacobi theta functions .",
    "in this section we discuss the parametrization ( 3.11 ) of the deformed phase space in a more detail .",
    "consider the expectation value of the deformed angular momentum operator @xmath42 given by ( 3.2 ) . on using ( 1.10 ) , ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.12 ) we arrive at the following relation : @xmath82 it follows from numerical calculations that there are large regions of the phase space parametrized by @xmath0 and @xmath35 such that @xmath83_q,\\ ] ] where the approximation is very good .",
    "for example , for @xmath84 , and @xmath85 the maximal relative error is of order 1 per cent .",
    "the fact that ( 4.2 ) is not valid for arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath35 is not surprising .",
    "we only recall that in the case of the coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a sphere [ 9 ] we have a condition @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the norm of the vector @xmath88 of the classical angular momentum parametrizing the coherent states , ensuring the ( approximate ) coincidence of the average of the angular momentum operator and @xmath88 . in our opinion ,",
    "the meaning of the approximate relations like ( 4.2 ) is that the coherent states are as close as possible to the classical phase space .",
    "we conclude that the parameter @xmath63_q$ ] in ( 3.11 ) can be regarded as a deformed version of the classical angular momentum .",
    "let us finally recall that in the limit @xmath68 , when ( 4.1 ) reduces to @xmath89 we have a perfect approximation of the classical phase space for arbitrary @xmath35 [ 2 ] .",
    "namely , the maximal error of ( 4.2 ) is of order @xmath90 per cent , and we have the _ exact _ equality in the case with @xmath35 integer or half - integer .",
    "we now examine the role of the parameter @xmath36 in the parametrization ( 3.11 ) . taking into account ( 1.10 ) , ( 1.6@xmath91 ) and ( 3.12 ) we find @xmath92 in the limit",
    "@xmath93 this formula takes the form @xmath94 proceeding analogously as in [ 2 ] we define the relative expectation value @xmath95 where @xmath96 . hence @xmath97 therefore , the parameter @xmath36 labelling the coherent states can be identified with the classical angle .",
    "we now study the distribution of eigenvectors @xmath21 s of the operator @xmath42 in the normalized coherent state .",
    "we recall that in the non - deformed case this is the distribution of energies of a quantum particle moving freely in a ( unit ) circle [ 2 ] .",
    "the computer simulations indicate that the function ( see ( 3.12 ) and ( 3.15 ) ) @xmath98 which gives the probability of finding the system in the state @xmath21 when the system is in the normalized coherent state @xmath99 , has the behaviour the same as in the non - deformed case , that is @xmath100 is peaked at @xmath101 . however , in opposition to the distribution referring to the non - deformed coherent states , when @xmath56 , which is the `` discrete '' gaussian distribution of the form [ 2 ] @xmath102 where the approximation is very good , the distribution ( 4.8 ) is asymmetrical one ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we finally discuss the probability density @xmath103 for the coordinates in the normalized coherent state @xmath104 , of the form ( see ( 3.17 ) ) @xmath105 as with the non - deformed case ( see ( 3.18 ) and ( 3.16 ) ) the function @xmath103 is peaked at @xmath106 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath36 in ( 3.11 ) can be really regarded as the classical angle .",
    "we finally study a generalization of the @xmath0-deformed coherent states discussed above arising from taking into consideration the so called `` squeezed states '' introduced in [ 10 ] .",
    "these states amount a generalization of the non - deformed coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a circle introduced in [ 2 ] and can be regarded as a version of the coherent states on a circle introduced in [ 3 ] .",
    "namely , they can be defined as a solution of the eigenvalue equation generalizing ( 2.1 ) such that [ 10 ] @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 is a real parameter .",
    "clearly , the case of @xmath110 corresponds to the coherent states discussed in section 2 .",
    "an attempt to provide a physical interpretation of this dimensionless parameter was made in [ 3 ] and [ 11 ] , where it is suggested that it controls the ratio of spatial width of the coherent states to the length of the circle .",
    "the counterparts of the relations ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.7 ) are of the form @xmath111 now , we define the generalized @xmath0-deformed coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a circle as the solution of the eigenvalue equation @xmath112 where @xmath113 of course , the states @xmath75 given by ( 3.7 ) refer to the case with @xmath110 . using ( 5.5 ) and ( 5.6 ) we easily obtain the following generalizations of the relations ( 3.10 ) , ( 3.13 ) and ( 3.15 ) , respectively :",
    "@xmath114 applying the dalambert ratio test we find that the series ( 5.9 ) is not convergent for arbitrary ( positive ) @xmath115 .",
    "namely , it follows that it is convergent if @xmath116 , and divergent if @xmath117 .",
    "notice that these conditions seem to distinguish the case @xmath110 discussed earlier , because only if @xmath110 the series ( 5.9 ) is convergent for arbitrary @xmath35 .",
    "in this work we have introduced the @xmath0-deformed coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a circle . the correctness of the construction is confirmed by the quasi - classical character of the coherent states manifested for example by the behaviour of the expectation values of the deformed angular momentum operator .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall that the non - deformed coherent states specified by ( 2.1 ) as well as the coherent states of a quantum particle on a sphere introduced by us in [ 9 ] are concrete realization of the general mathematical scheme of construction of the bargmann spaces introduced in the recent papers [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] and [ 13 ] .",
    "thus , bearing in mind the observations presented herein , an interesting problem naturally arises of finding deformations of coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a sphere .",
    "it should be noted that in view of the observations of dimakis and mller - hoissen [ 14 ] one can relate by the suitable change of variables , the @xmath0-deformation of the quantum mechanics on a circle described by the jackson derivative ( 3.5 ) with a discrete quantum mechanics on a lattice .",
    "we finally remark that the results of this paper would be of importance in the theory of special functions .",
    "we only recall that the formulae ( 3.13 ) , ( 3.15 ) and ( 3.17 ) describe a quantum deformation of the jacobi theta functions .",
