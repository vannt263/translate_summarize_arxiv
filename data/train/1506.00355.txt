    "among the polymer rheologists the notion of internal friction associated with a single polymer chain is more than twenty five years old @xcite .",
    "surprisingly it is only very recently that the topic has gained attention in the chemical and biophysics community .",
    "although some earlier works in chemical physics community did point out the importance of internal friction in single chain dynamics @xcite but did not receive the attention it should have .",
    "however recent experiments on looping and folding dynamics @xcite in proteins have indicated the non - negligible role of internal friction . in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning that loop formation between any two parts of a bio - polymer @xcite is supposedly the primary step of protein folding , dna cyclization and since internal friction affects looping it is obvious that measurements of folding rates in proteins would predict the importance of solvent independent internal friction as well @xcite .",
    "subsequently not only these recent experiments @xcite on polypeptides and proteins showed internal friction to play a pivotal role in the dynamics but also motivated theoretical chemical physicists to come up with statistical mechanical models for single polymer chain with the inclusion of internal friction @xcite and apply these models to investigate the loop formation dynamics .",
    "other than model build up there have been attempts to elucidate the origin of internal friction in proteins based on computer simulation studies @xcite .",
    "a careful literature survey would reveal that it was de gennes @xcite , who introduced the concept of internal viscosity at the single chain level .",
    "rabin and ttinger proposed an expression for the relaxation time , @xmath7 associated with internal viscosity following an idea of de gennes @xcite , which is @xmath8 where , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath3 are the monomer size and chain the length respectively , @xmath0 is the flory exponent @xcite .",
    "therefore in the limit solvent viscosity @xmath11 , it has a non - zero intercept proportional to the internal viscosity @xmath12 .",
    "this is what exactly seen in recent experiments where the plot of reconfiguration time vs solvent viscosity has a finite intercept equal to the time scale for the internal friction .",
    "to the best of our knowledge so far all the theoretical attempts on loop formation in a single chain with internal friction have been restricted to @xmath13 solvent , with @xmath14 , when the chain behaves ideally .",
    "but the experimental conditions remain close to a good solvent rather than a @xmath13 solvent .",
    "there have been few theoretical studies to elucidate the effect of solvent quality on loop formation in single polymer chain @xcite and unfortunately there exists almost no theoretical study to analyze the combined effect of solvent quality and internal friction on the ring closure dynamics in polymer chains other than the very recent simulation by yu and luo @xcite .",
    "apart from the solvent quality , denaturant concentration does play an important role in ring closure dynamics @xcite of proteins as it profoundly affects the compactness of the protein and routinely used in experiments .",
    "very recently samanta and chakrabarti @xcite used a compacted rouse chain model with internal friction to infer the role of denaturant on ring closure dynamics .",
    "but the model works only in the @xmath13 solvent condition where a phantom rouse chain description works .",
    "experiments have been performed with proteins away from the @xmath13 conditions where excluded volume interactions along with the internal friction play important roles . to take care of excluded volume interactions one has to go beyond phantom chain description but",
    "then the many body nature of the problem does not allow an analytical solution .",
    "one possibility would be to perform computer simulation as is recently done by yu and luo @xcite",
    ". other possibility would be to work with a polymer chain where the excluded volume interactions are taken care of at the mean field level .",
    "we take the second route and propose a very general model that takes care of solvent quality as well as denaturant in addition to internal friction .",
    "we call it  solvent dependent compacted rouse with internal friction ( sdcrif ) \" . to take care of solvent effect",
    "we closely follow the work of panja and barkema @xcite where an approximate analytical expression for the end to end vector correlation function for a flexible chain in an arbitrary solvent was proposed based on a series of computer simulations .",
    "the expression carries a parameter @xmath0 similar in the spirit of flory exponent @xcite which takes care of solvent quality .",
    "a value of @xmath14 corresponds to a @xmath13 solvent and in that case the correlation function is exact and reduces to the text book expression for the ideal chain @xcite , on the other hand @xmath15 ( @xmath16 more precisely ) @xcite corresponds to a self avoiding flexible chain ( good solvent ) as is the case with real polymers .",
    "importantly the same expression can be used for a range of values of @xmath0 corresponding to different solvent qualities .",
    "very recently such a mean field flory exponent based model has been used to describe ring polymer dynamics @xcite .",
    "next is the inclusion of internal friction which is done similarly as in case of a phantom polymer chain @xcite .",
    "further to take care of the denaturant which controls the compactness of the protein a confining harmonic potential with force constant @xmath1 is used as is done in a very recent study by the authors @xcite and also in the context of diffusing polymers in microconfinements @xcite or in case of bubble formation in double stranded dna @xcite .",
    "so the novelty of sdcrif remains in its applicability for a range of solvent quality , denaturant concentration and in addition it also takes care of internal friction ( @xmath2 ) when required .",
    "sdcrif reduces to rouse model in the limit @xmath17 and to  compacted rouse with internal friction ( crif ) \" @xcite in the limit @xmath18 .",
    "the looping dynamics is studied within wilemski fixman ( wf ) framework @xcite with sdcrif , assuming the polymer chain to be gaussian .",
    "it is worth mentioning that wf formalism has extensively been used to calculate the average ring closure or looping time in presence of hydrodynamic interactions by chakrabarti @xcite and to elucidate the effect of viscoelastic solvent @xcite and even applied to ring closing of a semiflexible chain @xcite .",
    "the arrangement of the paper is as follows .",
    "the model sdcrif is introduced in section @xmath19 .",
    "section @xmath20 deals with the method used to calculate the reconfiguration and ring closure time . results and discussions",
    "are presented in section @xmath21 and section @xmath22 concludes the paper .",
    "in the rouse model , the polymer chain is treated as a phantom chain @xcite , where the hydrodynamics interactions and the excluded volume effects are not present . if @xmath23 denotes the position of the @xmath24 monomer at time @xmath25 of such a chain , made of @xmath26 monomers , @xmath27 varying from @xmath28 to @xmath3 .",
    "the equation describing the dynamics of the chain is the following    @xmath29    where @xmath30 denotes the friction coefficient and @xmath31 is the spring constant where @xmath32 is the kuhn length .",
    "@xmath33 is the random force with moments    @xmath34    the above equation is solved by decomposing it into normal modes as follows @xmath35 . in the normal mode description",
    "the above force balance equation transforms to the following    @xmath36    the time correlation function of the normal modes is    @xmath37    the above expression is for a phantom polymer chain , a chain in @xmath13 solvent . in reality",
    "@xmath13 condition is rarely achieved and the chain behaves as in a good solvent where the chain swells due to the excluded volume interactions .",
    "for example buscaglia et .",
    "al showed @xcite that to a 11 residue polypeptide chain , 6 m gdmcl and 8 m urea are good solvents but aqueous buffer is very close to a @xmath13 solvent .",
    "it is also not uncommon to encounter a situation representing more of a bad solvent where the chain has a collapsed conformation . to take care of solvent quality we introduce an exponent @xmath0 similar in the spirit of flory exponent @xcite in the above expression for the time correlation function of the normal modes",
    "this inclusion closely follows the work of panja and barkema @xcite .",
    "apart from the solvent quality the presence of denaturant also alters protein conformation .",
    "recently such effects have been taken care of by introducing a confining potential @xmath38 where , @xmath1 is the spring constant .",
    "in addition such a chain can posses what is known as the internal friction , @xmath2 and can be termed as ",
    "solvent dependent compacted rouse with internal friction ( sdcrif ) \" .",
    "earlier works discuss in detail how the inclusion of internal friction is done @xcite . like",
    "the rouse model the end to end distribution of the polymer chain remains gaussian in sdcrif as well .",
    "experiments also showed that gaussian distributions of end to end distances of proteins are not too bad approximations @xcite .",
    "any deviations from the gaussian behavior is negligibly small @xcite . for sdcrif",
    "the basic structure of the correlation function remains the same but has three extra parameters @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath39    where , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the relaxation time for @xmath42 mode is @xmath43 .",
    "as expected with @xmath14 which corresponds to @xmath13 solvent , sdcrif gives back  compacted rouse with internal friction ( crif ) \" @xcite , when @xmath1 and @xmath2 both are nonzero .",
    "a more realistic situation would be @xmath15 corresponding to good solvent .",
    "if the confining potential is removed , the model no longer represents a compacted chain but still remains solvent dependent rouse and can be termed as  solvent dependent rouse with internal friction ( sdrif ) \" .",
    "further if the internal friction @xmath2 is ignored but @xmath44 , the model reduces to solvent dependent rouse ( sdr ) , and as expected , in the limit when @xmath2 , @xmath1 both are zero and @xmath14 , rouse chain is recovered .",
    "another model would be  solvent dependent compacted rouse ( sdcr ) \" when @xmath45 , but @xmath46 .",
    "sdcr can account for denaturant effect even in the absence of internal friction which we have used later to reproduce the reconfiguration time of an idp in high denaturant concentration when internal friction should be negligible . fig .",

    "( [ fig : b ] ) the equilibrium distribution of the end - to - end distance is shown for the polymer at different solvent quality in absence of the confining potential .",

    "the parameters have been chosen in accordance to the work by schuler s group @xcite on cold shock protein ( csp ) and prothymosin @xmath5 ( prot@xmath5 ) and has been mentioned in all the figures . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : c ] ) the same distribution is shown for good solvent but in presence of three different values of @xmath1 .",
    "as the @xmath1 controls the compactness of the polymer , increasing the value of @xmath1 should result in the higher degree of internal friction . since there is no first principle relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we have used an ansatz in our calculation @xcite .",

    "higher the value of @xmath85 poorer the solvent , narrower the distribution .          in order to calculate reconfiguration time one has to calculate the correlation function between normal modes defined in eq .",

    "( [ fig : d ] ) .",
    "this shows how @xmath92 changes with the solvent quality if all the other parameters remain fixed .",
    "the plot shows that @xmath92 ( for @xmath93 ) increases with @xmath0 .",
    "thus for poor solvents corresponding to lower value of @xmath0 , @xmath92 is lower and as one approaches good solvent @xmath92 increases resulting in slower relaxation .",
    "this would definitely lead to slower reconfiguration and looping time in good solvent as compared to bad or poor solvent .",
    "similar trend for the third normal mode can be seen from the plot in the inset of the fig .",
    "( [ fig : d ] ) .",
    "recent simulation also confirm this @xcite and shows an order of magnitude increase in the looping time in the good solvent as compared to the poor solvent .",
    "the reconfiguration times of a chain for different values of @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : e ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that at a value @xmath94 , the reconfiguration time increases by a factor of @xmath95 on changing @xmath73 to @xmath15 .",
    "one aspect of the reconfiguration time is its dependence on solvent viscosity @xcite .",
    "experiments show a linear dependence of reconfiguration time on solvent viscosity @xcite . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : e ] ) the reconfiguration times @xmath101 are plotted against the solvent viscosity at different values of @xmath0 in absence of any confining potential ( @xmath99 ) and non zero internal friction ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the figure clearly shows @xmath103 increases linearly with increasing normalized solvent viscosity @xmath104 , with a positive intercept in the limit @xmath105 , @xmath106 being the viscosity of water .",
    "what is surprising is the value of intercept is practically independent of solvent quality .",
    "this intercept corresponds to the internal friction which is completely dry in this case .",
    "the trend can be fitted with an almost analytically exact expression @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109s have @xmath0 dependence and are @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 for the poor , @xmath13 and good solvent respectively .",
    "thus poorer the solvent lower the slope . in poor solvent reconfiguration time",
    "is not only fast but also less affected by the viscosity of the solvent .",
    "this is presumably because of the collapsed form of the polymer chain .",
    "( [ fig : f ] ) is the plot of @xmath113 vs @xmath104 in presence of a fixed confining potential @xmath114 but at three different values of @xmath0 covering a range of solvent qualities .",
    "interestingly in this case the intercepts are found to be different when the intercepts were magnified as can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "( [ fig : f ] ) .",
    "this is because @xmath115 has @xmath1 as well as @xmath0 dependence as can be seen from the table .",
    "[ tablerouse ] .",
    "so even with the same value of @xmath1 , changing @xmath0 would result a change in the effective force constant , @xmath116 of the chain and hence a change in the value of the intercept . in all the cases @xmath2 remains the same and the time scales associated with the internal friction @xmath115 are changed by very small amount which means the dependence of @xmath115 on @xmath0 is very weak and it can not reproduce the denaturant effect observed in the experiments , which is why we need @xmath1 and the ansatz which connects @xmath1 with @xmath2 to take care of the denaturant effect on a polymer without changing the solvent quality .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : g ] ) where we have looked into the viscosity dependence of @xmath113 in different values of @xmath1 for good solvent ( @xmath15 ) . in this case",
    "the change in the values of the intercepts is very evident because of the different degrees of compactness of the chain .",
    "another important observation is the case with higher @xmath1 value has a higher intercept but it is less steeper making the change in the reconfiguration time less prone to the viscosity of the solvent .",
    "this is how @xmath1 can replicate the experimental results @xcite where it has been found that if denaturant is introduced to a polymer solution , the polymer becomes less compact which results in lower value of internal friction @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath1 controls the compactness of the protein thus connects to the denaturant concentration . the higher the denaturant concentration lower the @xmath1 value .",
    "this is also reflected in our ansatz as increasing denaturant concentration would mean smaller @xmath79 and lower internal friction @xmath2 .",
    "but @xmath1 does not speak for the solvent quality rather it is @xmath0 which accounts for that . in the later section we used sdcrif to compare experimental data on cold shock protein and prothymosin @xmath5 ( prot@xmath5 ) @xcite and",
    "have confirmed this .",
    "we have also looked at the viscosity dependence of the looping time and have found it to be @xmath117 with @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "a detailed study on the viscosity dependence of the looping time can be found in one of our earlier works @xcite .",
    "( [ fig : h ] ) is the log - log plot of the reconfiguration time for a chain with @xmath119 vs chain length @xmath3 of the polymer for different values of @xmath0 , the parameter accounting for the solvent quality .",
    "there is a general trend , @xmath120 as @xmath121 .",
    "this result is expected and can be predicted by looking at the scaling of the end to end vector correlation function with the chain length .",
    "when the same calculations were done in presence of internal friction as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : i ] ) the dependence on the chain length becomes weaker in general but the relative trend remains the same , in poor solvent dynamics is faster .",
    "although the chain reconfiguration in general become slower due to the presence of internal friction . to see how the chain dynamics changes in presence of the confining potential the same calculations were again performed for three different values of @xmath1 but putting internal friction @xmath45 in good solvent ( @xmath15 ) as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : j ] ) . here as @xmath45 therefore ,",
    "@xmath122 and @xmath84 whereas @xmath123 is scaled as @xmath114 .",
    "this result is very interesting as it can be seen from the fig .",
    "( [ fig : j ] ) , that the @xmath3 dependence remains practically unchanged .",
    "the reason for this as follows . we restrict ourselves to a value of @xmath1 such that",
    "the effective force constant @xmath116 is in the same order of magnitude of @xmath124 .",
    "for example a choice of @xmath125 gives @xmath126 .",
    "now since lower normal modes contribute mostly in reconfiguration dynamics @xcite , taking the contribution from @xmath93 normal mode gives @xmath127 and thus leads to unchanged scaling of the reconfiguration time with the chain length @xmath3 for a given value of @xmath0 .",
    "similar calculations have been done for looping time based on the wf approximation @xcite as can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ fig : k ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig : l ] ) .",
    "the same arguments hold for the looping time and the trends are similar .",
    "scaling of the looping time as @xmath128 for the rouse chain @xcite as obtained earlier can be confirmed with a choice of @xmath14 , @xmath99 and @xmath45 and is shown in fig .",
