    ".    such environment induced decoherence process often is explained as supression of off - diagonal elements of reduced density matrix , but may be described using expressions with pure states as well @xcite .",
    "we still have superposition , considered kind of decoherence is not relevant with _ definite outcomes in quantum measurements _ @xcite . on the other hand , there are different kinds decoherence processes @xcite .    for `` not accurate '' separation it may be produced `` classical kind '' of definite outcomes instead of superposition .",
    "such process is possible , because for asymmetric potential we have two energy levels ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wella ] on page ) and if emission with transition to level with lower energy is possible , the system becomes localized in one well .",
    "similar kind of `` radiative '' decoherence processes was already discussed and used above for preparation of initial state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sqpoly ] on page ) .",
    "it should be mentioned also , that after such transition with asymmetric potential , system may stay localized around one minimum even for further coherent evolution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : skewrot ] on page ) .",
    "after separation decoherence processes may not cancel superposition and only hide and even `` lock '' it , formally it produces some analogue of isolated `` everett branches '' @xcite .",
    "the possibility of `` branching '' sometime causes active objections , but except of aesthetical reasons there is still not found any strong evidence against it",
    ". really idea of quantum computer was considered from very beginning as a possible experimental test of everett s interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "anyway such quantum register is not worse for measurements , than some other models , it is rather more convenient for explanation of some standard problems .",
    "if we may guarantee , that separation is performed accurate enough , _ i.e. , _  does not change coefficients @xmath163 and @xmath164 in eq .",
    "( [ condexch ] ) and if we may prepare quantum register in same state @xmath165 arbitrary number of times , we may use standard methods of quantum tomography to find the state .",
    "it is necessary to have possibility not only measure the state @xmath165 , but also perform some set of known quantum gates ( say @xmath166 ) before some measurements in the series .",
    "the same is true for arbitrary number of qubits @xcite .",
