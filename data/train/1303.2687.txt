    "obtaining a complete understanding of topological quantum matter has a fundamental significance across condensed - matter physics as well as potential practical implications within quantum science . on the one hand , characterizing `` non - local '' topological order and unveiling connections with the emergence of `` topologically protected '' edge states are prerequisites for developing a unified classification of matter beyond landau s paradigm of symmetry breaking @xcite . on the other hand , taking full advantage of the distinctive robustness features that the degenerate ground - state manifold enjoys may offer new pathways to fault - tolerance in topological quantum memory and quantum computation @xcite .",

    "our interest , however , is in _ tr - invariant topological superconductivity_. existing proposals for tr - invariant tss have thus far largely relied on the proximity effect between a 3d ti and a conventional ( @xmath0-wave ) superconductor @xcite ( see also ref . for early contributions ) , or on access to unconventional ( @xmath4 and/or spin - triplet ) superconducting order parameter @xcite .",
    "our motivation is to explore whether alternative routes to tr - invariant tss exist based on conventional @xmath0-wave bulk pairing symmetry .",
    "our key physical insight is to take advantage of _ multiband _ superconductivity , directly in the spirit of the original proposal by suhl - matthias - walker ( smw ) for two - band @xmath0-wave superconductors @xcite . following the experimental discovery of mgb@xmath5 in 2001 @xcite ,",

    "we aim to continue our exploration of tr - invariant multi - band ts , with the goal of ( i ) obtaining a more complete characterization of the non - trivial topological features that emerge for this class of hamiltonians ; and ( ii ) gaining a deeper insight on basic aspects of ts and their edge states in general .",
    "the content is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "ii by introducing the relevant class of two - band tr - invariant model hamiltonians for systems of different spatial dimension .",
    "while it is not possible to analytically determine the excitation spectrum for general parameter values , we show how an _ exact _ solution leading to non - trivial topological behavior may be obtained under the assumption that the two _ pairing gaps are @xmath2-shifted _ from one another , including in 3d as long as we focus on the excitation spectrum of tr - invariant modes .",
    "we argue that , as long as two decoupled `` kramers sectors '' are identifiable , restricting to a _",
    "such sectors allows to naturally construct @xmath1 topological invariants applicable when tr symmetry is preserved .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate how topological numbers originally defined in low dimension ( such as , notably , berry phases ) can be extended beyond 1d upon restriction to low - dimensional manifolds in parameter space .",
    "section iii is devoted to characterizing the topological features that emerge in our model as the spatial dimension increases from 1d to 3d .",
    "this is done by first examining the bulk topological response , and then by establishing the extent to which bulk properties relate to the existence of majorana edge states via a bulk - boundary correspondence . in all dimensions ,",
    "we find that a @xmath1 invariant distinguishes topologically trivial from non - trivial ts phases . the latter",
    "are found to support an _ odd number of kramers pairs of counter - propagating ( helical ) majorana modes on each boundary_. we explicitly show that gapless majorana modes existing in topologically trivial phases are generally not robust against perturbations , even if tr - symmetry is preserved .    in sec .",
    "iv , we explore the consequences of explicitly breaking tr according to different mechanisms , with emphasis on determining the conditions under which gapless majorana modes may persist , and characterizing their degree of robustness compared to the tr - invariant case .",
    "we first analyze the effect of a static magnetic field in various physical scenarios , allowing for the field to act in different directions on the bulk or solely on the boundary , respectively .",
    "in particular , we show how the _ full _ excitation spectrum can still be exactly determined in the presence of a longitudinal zeeman field in 2d , and how topological invariants must be appropriately redefined as a consequence of tr symmetry being broken . in general , we find that gapless majorana modes may exist in the presence of applied or impurity magnetic fields .",
    "however , _ their degree of robustness against subsequent perturbations depends in general on both the symmetry and the details of the latter_. similar conclusions apply if tr symmetry is explicitly broken due to a phase mismatch between the pairing gaps relative to the intended value of @xmath2 .",
    "remarkably , the application of a suitable zeeman field may then be used to _ restore gapless majorana modes _ that would be gapped in under a phase mismatch alone , and to induce a topological quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between helical and chiral phases , accompanied by a vanishing bulk gap .    in sec .",
    "v , we present some considerations on the practical feasibility of our proposal in real materials . in particular , we qualitatively discuss implications in the context of the search for topological superconductivity in 3d doped ti materials @xcite , and follow up on our original suggestion @xcite of realizations in iron - based superconductors exhibiting @xmath6 _ pairing symmetry_. we conclude in sec .",
    "vi with a summary of our main results and an outlook to open problems .",
    "additional technical details are included in the appendices .",
    "specifically , appendix [ appa ] presents a complete symmetry analysis of our ts model hamiltonian , thereby defining its symmetry class .",
    "appendix [ self ] briefly discusses the role of the self - consistency constraint in determining the physical accessibility and stability of different phases , whereas appendix [ appb ] shows the explicit form of the hamiltonian matrix when arbitrary static magnetic fields perturb the ts system .",
    "finally , appendix [ appc ] addresses the important problem of a consistent , numerically gauge - invariant evaluation of topological invariants , by discussing berry phase and chern number computations .",
    "our starting point is a class of tr - invariant two - band hamiltonians of the form introduced in ref .  .",
    "consider a regular lattice in @xmath7 spatial dimensions , with orthonormal vectors @xmath8 , where the relevant set of indexes @xmath9 depends upon dimensionality and @xmath10 is the number of lattice sites in the @xmath11th direction ( for example , @xmath12 with a total number of sites @xmath13 in 2d , and so on ) .",

    "( [ spectrum2d ] ) for the corresponding energies @xmath79 .",
    "the phase diagram of the hamiltonian @xmath41 , as the dimension changes from 1d to 3d , will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ rd ] , with appropriate topological numbers being identified and labeling each phase .",
    "two additional remarks are in order in regard to the hamiltonian @xmath41 in eqs .",
    "( [ ham0])-([ham ] ) .",
    "first , the contribution @xmath80 is a _ special case _ of the general smw hamiltonian for a two - band superconductor with @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry @xcite , corresponding to the situation where no inter - band electron - phonon process takes place . in this case , the two superconducting gaps are also associated with two distinct transition temperatures . in principle ( and in fact most likely in real materials ) , an inter - band interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath81 may also be present , in addition to the two intra - band interactions with strength @xmath82 and @xmath83 in eqs .",
    "( [ ham])-([gaps ] ) . within a mean - field description , it is easy to check that the effect of the additional term amounts to a renormalization of the attraction strengths for each band , @xmath84 thus , our analysis can be straightforwardly extended to the general case @xmath85 . in particular , requiring that @xmath86 still yields @xmath87 as a unique solution if @xmath88 , therefore all the results obtained for @xmath89 apply with no modification in this case . while different attraction strengths , as determined by band structure details , can be easily accommodated in principle , we shall show in sec . [ away ] that the specific values of these parameters do not play a crucial role ( cf . fig .",
    "[ mismatch1 ] ) .",
    "thus , for simplicity we shall focus on the already rich behavior emerging for @xmath88 henceforth .",
    "second , as written in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , the superconducting term in @xmath41 involves @xmath0-wave pairing _ in each band _ separately .",
    "consider , however , the following unitary transformation for each mode @xmath90 : @xmath91 }   \\big{\\ } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , at the symmetry point defined by eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) , @xmath41 transforms into : @xmath92,\\ ] ] which can in turn be written in real space as follows : @xmath93 that is , the original intra - band superconductivity is transformed into _ inter - band spin - singlet superconductivity _ , with the original intra - band so interaction being correspondingly transformed into inter - band so interaction . thus , all the results obtained from investigating @xmath41 in the limit @xmath94 can be directly generalized to the class of models described by @xmath95 .",
    "since the hamiltonian @xmath41 preserves tr symmetry , topological invariants that are applicable to the tr - broken case will , in general , fail to characterize the system s topological response .",
    "while different approaches have been pursued @xcite , our strategy is to build on previous work @xcite and construct suitable `` partial '' topological quantum numbers in order to distinguish between topologically trivial and non - trivial phases @xcite .",
    "in particular , in this work we shall focus on three kinds of topological indicators , which we define in what follows .",
    "we anticipate that despite their different form , these indicators are in essence equivalent when applicable , as we will demonstrate for our system in sec .",
    "[ rd ] .    * @xmath96 partial berry phase sum parity .",
    "* consider the simplest 1d case first . by taking advantage of the decoupled structure between tr - pairs in the limit of @xmath2-shifted gaps [ eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) ] , we may consider the sum of the berry phases @xcite for the _ two occupied negative bands of one kramers sector only _ , say , @xmath97 and @xmath98 of @xmath57 , with each berry phase given by ( see also appendix d for more detail on the actual numerical calculation ) : @xmath99 since @xmath100 may only attain the values @xmath42 or @xmath2 ( mod @xmath101 ) for a system with inversion symmetry @xcite , a @xmath1 topological invariant may be naturally constructed as follows : @xmath102    for @xmath103 , the basic idea is to use lower - dimensional topological numbers upon restricting to a lower - dimensional manifold in parameter space @xcite . in 2d , for instance , note that the superconductor in the momentum planes @xmath104 is mapped to itself under inversion and has the topology of a 1d ring under pbc .",
    "thus , it is possible to define a @xmath105 invariant by analyzing the parity of the partial berry phase sum _ restricted to the planes @xmath106_. that is , @xmath107 the 3d case can be treated in a similar fashion and is discussed in more detail directly in sec .",
    "[ 3d ] .    * @xmath96 partial chern sum parity .",
    "* this invariant was originally introduced and used in ref .   for the 2d geometry . in a similar spirit to the above",
    ", the idea is to use the chern numbers ( cns ) of the _ two occupied negative bands of one kramers sector only _ , say @xmath57 as before .",
    "call these cns @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and let @xmath110 denote the band-@xmath111 eigenvector of @xmath57 .",
    "then the cns @xmath112 , @xmath113 , are given by ( see also appendix d for its numerical implementation ) : @xmath114 thus , a @xmath1 invariant may be constructed as follows : @xmath115 again , the extension to the 3d case will be addressed in sec .",
    "[ 3d ] .    *",
    "@xmath96 partial fermion number parity .",
    "* as discussed in ref .",
    ", there is a direct connection between the invariant @xmath116 defined in eq .",
    "( [ invariant1 ] ) and the fermion number parity of the tr - invariant modes .",
    "let us focus on the ground - state fermion number parity of the tr - invariant points @xmath117 in the first brillouin zone . since for these modes , the two tr hamiltonians @xmath118 and @xmath119 are decoupled , we need only concentrate on the ground - state parity property of @xmath118 .",

    "thus , we define a @xmath1 partial fermion number parity invariant as follows : @xmath128 computing the fermion number parity of the tr - invariant modes _ from one representative of each kramers pairs _ is consistent with the fact that only a partial cn ( or berry phase ) sum can detect ts phases in the presence of tr symmetry .",
    "a relevant question regarding the existence of non - trivial ts phases and their physical properties is the role played by spatial dimensionality . in this section",
    ", we will explore the topological response of our hamiltonian @xmath41 as we move from 1d to 3d , first through _ bulk properties _",

    "d. we find that the parity of the partial berry phase sum , @xmath133 , is consistent with the parity of partial chern sum , @xmath116 , in the whole parameter space .",
    "the topological responses for @xmath39 and @xmath140 as representative examples are shown in the two top panels of fig .",
    "[ pd ] , with the integer numbers in parenthesis giving the partial chern sum @xmath141 [ see also fig . 1 in ref . ] . as it will become explicit from analyzing the bulk - boundary correspondence ( sec .",
    "[ bbc ] ) , an odd ( even ) value of @xmath141 corresponds to non - trivial ( trivial ) topological phases , respectively .",
    "we stress that in 2d qpts are present also between phases carrying the _ same _ partial chern sum parity , for instance separating phases with @xmath142 and @xmath143 , as well as @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( blue dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "@xmath146 invariant is necessary in order to identify all the topological phases _ in the bulk phase diagram .",
    "a similar characterization was encountered for the model analyzed in ref . , where , however , tr symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "since the partial berry phase sum is , by definition , a @xmath1 quantity , this also makes @xmath147 inadequate to fully characterize the phase diagram , although @xmath133 still correctly diagnoses the presence of non - trivial topological features .",
    "the 3d hamiltonian @xmath41 is especially interesting in the light of recent discoveries of candidate tis @xcite and investigations of possible ts materials in 3d geometries @xcite . since our 3d superconductor in the momentum planes @xmath148",
    "is mapped to itself under inversion and has the topology of a 2d torus under pbc , we may define a @xmath105 invariant by analyzing the partial chern sum restricted to such planes .",
    "if @xmath149 denotes the corresponding partial chern sum , then we can define the following @xmath105 parity invariant : @xmath150 note that we could choose the partial chern sum on the planes @xmath151 or @xmath106 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the resulting values of @xmath116 would be the same on the planes @xmath151 ,",
    "@xmath106 , and @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , since only the parity of @xmath152 matters , the definition in eq .",
    "( [ invariant2 ] ) is equivalent to the parity of @xmath153 .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the `` strong @xmath105 invariant '' that has been invoked to distinguish strong vs. weak ( trivial ) ti phases @xcite .",
    "the topological phase diagrams for @xmath39 and @xmath140 are shown in the two bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ pd ] , where an odd ( even ) value of @xmath141 corresponds to non - trivial ( trivial ) topological phases , respectively .",
    "notice that although we use , as in 2d , a @xmath146 number to map out the 3d phase diagrams , _ the parity @xmath116 _ ( hence a @xmath1 invariant ) _ suffices to identify all the phases _ , since all the qpt lines now separate phases with different parity , unlike in 2d .",
    "similarly , we may fix @xmath154 , and define the partial berry phase sum parity as : @xmath155 we find that the resulting values of @xmath133 are consistent with both @xmath116 and @xmath156 throughout the phase diagram .",
    "we also recall that in ref .",
    "a many - body generalization of the one - body berry phase was constructed in the presence of interaction , by properly defining twisted boundary conditions .",
    "thus , an interesting possibility for further exploration is whether the partial berry phase sum defined here might still characterize the _ topological response of an interacting system _ with tr and inversion symmetries , provided that only one representative from each tr - pair is selected .    in summary",
    ", we may conclude that the parity of the partial berry phase sum , of the partial chern sum , and of the partial fermion number are all equivalent to one another : @xmath157 thus , any of them can be used to characterize the @xmath105 invariance in our tr - invariant system irrespective of dimensionality , with odd ( even ) parity corresponding to non - trivial ( trivial ) topological phases , respectively .",
    "that being said , if there are qpt lines between phases that share the same parity ( such as in the 2d phase diagram ) , then a @xmath146 invariant ( the partial chern sum ) , is needed to distinguish and label all the phases .",
    "as mentioned , a bulk - boundary correspondence generally refers to the relationship between bulk properties of the system in a given phase and the existence and robustness of the corresponding edge states .",
    "specifically , for our tr - invariant hamiltonian , we formulate the bulk - boundary correspondence in terms of the relation between the bulk @xmath1 topological invariants and the _ parity of the number of tr - pairs of boundary modes _",
    "that is , a bulk phase characterized by odd ( even ) @xmath116 ( or , equivalently , @xmath158 ) is expected to correspond to an odd ( even ) number of tr-_pairs _ of edge states _ per boundary _ , which are robust against perturbations that preserve the symmetry class of the system ( diii in our case ) .",
    "one should , however , notice that there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect that the topological numbers that characterize the phases in the bulk phase diagram should be the same that also characterize the bulk - boundary correspondence .    in order to characterize the bulk - boundary correspondence in our model hamiltonian",
    ", we investigate @xmath41 with open boundary conditions ( obc ) along one spatial direction , while keeping pbc along the remaining direction(s ) .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the bulk property @xmath159 does correspond to an odd ( even ) number of _",

    "the situation is simplest for the 1d system : for instance , when @xmath164 , @xmath165 ( @xmath166 in the phase diagram of fig .  [ 1dpd ] ) , one pair of majorana edge modes exists at each end , while when @xmath167 , @xmath165 ( @xmath168 in the phase diagram of fig .",

    "[ 1dpd ] ) can likewise support two pairs of majorana modes per edge , corresponding to @xmath171 , respectively . since the bulk - boundary correspondence for the 2d case",

    "in fact , since one of the original majorana modes fuses with the bulk and thus only _ one _ edge mode exists on each boundary , this mode retains robustness against the effect of tr - preserving backscattering perturbation , despite tr being explicitly broken .    in order to verify the physical relevance of using relatively strong magnetic fields to restore majorana excitations , we have again also performed self - consistent calculations of the superconducting order parameter @xmath130 for representative situations , in particular for the situation just discussed , corresponding to the bottom panel of fig .",

    "as done above ( @xmath377 ) , a similar calculation shows that the degeneracy between the two majorana modes can not be lifted , despite the fact that they are _ not _ a quasi - tr pair .",
    "this is interesting as it demonstrates that _ `` unpaired '' majorana modes need not be , a priori , less robust than modes forming a ( quasi-)tr pair _ : a tr majorana pair is guaranteed to behave robustly against perturbations that preserve tr symmetry , however , once the latter is broken ( via @xmath236 in our example ) , it may happen that unpaired majorana modes are more robust against additional tr - breaking ( such as a phase mismatch , and possibly even backscattering if only one mode is present on each edge ) .",
    "thus , the robustness of edge modes ultimately depends on the specific form of the perturbations .",
    "as implied by the above discussion , the application of a tr - breaking zeeman magnetic field allows for effectively changing the helical nature of the original tr - invariant edge spectrum of @xmath41 into a chiral one [ figs .",

    "[ mismatch2](bottom ) , it is also possible that upon increasing the zeeman magnetic field , one of the original majorana modes dissolves into the bulk , leaving the system in a topologically non - trivial chiral phase .",
    "interestingly , a topological qpt between a helical quantum spin hall phase and a chiral spin - imbalanced quantum hall state was also predicted in ref .   for a 2d honeycomb fermionic lattice .",
    "while such a qpt is induced by tuning a rashba so coupling rather than a zeeman field , our results point to suggestive similarities between the underlying physics and additional routes for topological phases manipulation .",
    "identifying superconducting materials for which the hamiltonian @xmath41 in eq . ( [ ham ] ) , or its spin - singlet variant @xmath95 in eq . ( [ hamtilde ] ) , may provide an adequate physical model requires an in - depth dedicated study which is beyond our current scope . in this section ,",
    "we nevertheless provide some perspective that may be useful to guide further exploration , also in the context of ongoing experiments .    recently discovered materials such as cu@xmath379bi@xmath5se@xmath380 @xcite and sn@xmath381in@xmath379te @xcite are attracting significant attention as possible tr - invariant ( centro - symmetric ) tss in 3d . in general , strongly so - coupled doped semiconductors are natural candidates to search for topological superconductivity .",
    "the presence of a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) in the measured point - contact spectrum has been interpreted , in particular , as a signature of the surface helical majorana fermions associated with a non - trivial topological behavior .",
    "experimentally , it is observed that such a zbcp has a distinctive magnetic - field dependence , its amplitude being strongly suppressed by a relatively weak zeeman field applied perpendicularly to the cleaved surface , consistent with delocalization of majorana modes @xcite . while a theoretical description of cu@xmath379bi@xmath5se@xmath380 has been proposed based on an unconventional _ spin - triplet pairing with odd parity _",
    "@xcite , scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of the superconducting gap appear to be consistent , at least for current cu concentration , with a fully gapped @xmath0-wave spectrum and no mid - gap energy state .    with reference to our two - band model , there are two aspects we would like to highlight in regard to the above discussion .",
    "first , we have investigated the density of majorana modes ( _ dmm _ ) on the boundary as a function of the magnetic field strength in both 2d and 3d .",
    "suppose , specifically , that the system is originally in a ts phase characterized by cns @xmath382 in 3d and @xmath383 in 2d , in which cases a tr - pair of majorana modes at the dirac cones exist on each edge .",
    "when a weak magnetic field is applied , such that tr is broken but the cns remain unchanged , the two majorana modes become a quasi - tr - pair and may thus be expressed as in eq .",
    "( [ quasitrpair ] ) .",

    "clearly , in our two - band ts , a weak applied magnetic field delocalizes the majorana fermions in both cases , qualitatively similar to the observed zbcp dependence .",
    "second , it is interesting to contrast the _ dmm _ behavior to the one of a quantity which is more directly related to the measured scanning - tunneling spectrum , namely , the local density of states ( ldos ) , computed as @xmath385 , \\label{eqldos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath386 is the single - particle eigenvector corresponding to energy @xmath266 for @xmath387 with pbc in the @xmath388 direction , and obc in the @xmath389 direction . while a more in - depth analysis will be presented elsewhere @xcite , numerical results for the _ ldos _ profile of the same 2d ts considered in fig .",

    "although additional quantitative study is certainly needed before any solid conclusion can be reached ( see also ref .   for a recent proposal on topological superconductivity via proximity effects between @xmath6 wave iron - based superconductor and semiconductors ) , we conjecture that iron - based materials may provide a natural candidate for realizing our model in nature , as first suggested in ref . .",
