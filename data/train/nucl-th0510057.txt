    "the unitary extensions of chiral perturbation theory @xmath6 have brought new light in the study of the meson - baryon interaction and have shown that some well known resonances qualify as dynamically generated , or in simpler words , they are quasibound states of a meson and a baryon , the properties of which are described in terms of chiral lagrangians .",

    "the cross section is relatively independent of the chosen model for the @xmath0 ( solid vs. dashed line ) , and even the the phenomenological potential does not change much the result .",
    "the @xmath60 reaction is calculated in a similar way as for the @xmath61 final state by replacing the @xmath62 final state of the @xmath0 by the @xmath63 one and including a new tree level diagram in analogy to the process described at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : production ] : @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "the cross section for @xmath65 is much smaller than for the @xmath61 final state as fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_section ] shows . this is  among other reasons @xcite  due to the fact that the reaction takes places at much higher photon energies where the dynamically generated @xmath0 is off shell .",
    "in this paper we have studied the reactions @xmath66 and @xmath3 within a chiral unitary framework which considers the interaction of mesons and baryons in coupled channels and dynamically generates the @xmath0 . from the various processes , we find dominant the decay of the dynamically generated @xmath1 resonance into @xmath67 , followed by the unitarization , or in other words , the @xmath68 decay .",
    "a similar term provides also a tree level process which leads , together with the @xmath0 , to a characteristic double hump structure in the @xmath62 and @xmath51 invariant masses at higher photon energies .",
    "a virtue of this approach and a test of the nature of the resonance as a dynamically generated object is that one can make predictions about cross sections for the production of the resonance without introducing the resonance explicitly in the formalism since only its components in the @xmath69 and @xmath70 meson - baryon base is what matters , together with the coupling of the photons to these components and their interaction in a coupled channel formalism .",
    "in particular , the reactions studied here probe decay channels of these resonances such as @xmath71 or transitions like @xmath72 which are predicted by the model and not measured yet .",
    "the measurement of both cross sections is being performed at the elsa / bonn laboratory and hence the predictions are both interesting and opportune and can help us gain a better insight in the nature of some resonances , particularly the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 in the present case .",
