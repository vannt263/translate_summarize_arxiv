    "the combination of recent astrophysical and cosmological observations ( among which are the luminosity distance versus redshift relation up to @xmath0 from type ia supernovae  @xcite , the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies  @xcite and gravitational lensing  @xcite ) seems to indicate that the universe is accelerating and thus that about @xmath1 of the energy density of the universe is made of a matter with a negative pressure ( i.e. , having an equation of state @xmath2 ) .",
    "this raises the natural question of the physical nature of this matter component .",
    "indeed , a solution would be to have a cosmological constant ( for which @xmath3 ) but one will then have to face the well known _ cosmological constant problem _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , the fact that the value of this cosmological constant inferred from the cosmological observation is extremely small  about 120 order of magnitude  compared with the energy scales of high energy physics ( planck , grand unified theory , strong and even electroweak scales ) . another solution is to argue that there exists a ( yet unknown ) mechanism which makes the cosmological constant strictly vanish and to find another matter candidate able to explain the cosmological observations .",
    "indeed it assumes that the cosmological constant problem is somehow solved and replaces it by a _",
    "dark energy problem_.    this latter route has gained a lot of enthusiasm in the past years and many candidates have been proposed ( for recent reviews on see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . among all these proposals ,",
    "quintessence  @xcite seems to be the most promising mechanism . in these models",
    ", a scalar field is rolling down a potential decreasing to zero at infinity ( often referred to as a runaway potential ) hence acting as a fluid with an equation of state varying in the range @xmath4 if the field is minimally coupled .",
    "runaway potentials such as the exponential potential and inverse power law potentials @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 a mass scale , can be found in models where supersymmetry is dynamically broken  @xcite and in which flat directions are lifted by nonperturbative effects .    as clearly explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , all the models for this dark energy have to ( i ) show that they do not contain in a disguise way a cosmological constantlike fine - tuning ( the _ fine - tuning problem _ ) , ( ii ) explain why this kind of matter starts to dominate today ( the _ coincidence problem _ ) , ( iii ) give an equation of state compatible with the observational data ( the _ equation of state problem _ ) and ( iv ) arise from some high energy physics mechanisms ( the _ model building problem _ ) .",
    "quintessence models mainly solved the fine - tuning problem because of the existence of tracking solutions  @xcite ( first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) which are scaling attractor solutions of the field equations and allows the initial conditions for the scalar field to vary by about 150 orders of magnitude . the second tuning ( related to the coincidence )",
    "concerns the mass scale @xmath7 that has to be determined by the requirement that about @xmath1 of the energy density of the universe is in the quintessence field . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of the inverse power law potential , this mass scale is comparable to other scales from high energy physics and the tuning on this mass scale is mild provided the exponent @xmath8 is not too small ( @xmath8 must be bigger than @xmath9 so that @xmath10 ) .",
    "the equation of state depends on the shape of the potential and it is hoped that it will be soon determined by , e.g. , a weak lensing experiment  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that an exponential potential can not lead to an accelerating universe  @xcite and that the equation of state for an inverse power law potential mainly depends on the slope @xmath8 .",
    "as explained above , the model building is also addressed in the framework of supersymmetry    quintessence scenarios , however , have some important problems .",
    "the requirement of slow roll ( mandatory to have a negative pressure ) and the fact that the quintessence field dominates today imply that ( i ) it is very light  @xcite ( roughly of the order @xmath11 and it should induce violation of the equivalence principle and time variation of the gravitational constant ) and that ( ii ) the vacuum expectation value of the quintessence field today is of order of the planck mass .",
    "this latter problem led brax and martin  @xcite to propose that a supergravity correction had to be taken into account leading to the so - called supergravity ( sugra ) quintessence potential @xmath12 which shares the same properties as the inverse power law potential at early time but which stabilizes the quintessence field accounting for a better agreement of the equation of state .",
    "note that the two main features of a quintessence potential is that it must be steep enough for the field to be in a kinetic regime for a large set of initial conditions , hence redshifting faster than radiation and being subdominant at nucleosynthesis , and then to reach a slow roll regime to mimic a cosmological constant .",
    "this latter regime will always ultimately take place and the parameters of the potential have to be tuned so that it happens around today .",
    "the simplest waya to implement this idea are to use inverse power law potentials and exponential potentials which are one parameter potentials .",
    "another solution ( but involving more parameters ) is to consider potentials with a local minimum as was first proposed by wetterich  @xcite .",
    "an underlying motivation to replace the cosmological constant by a time dependent scalar field probably lies in string models in which any dimensionful parameter is expressed in terms of the fundamental string mass scale and the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field .",
    "for instance , string theory has revived the consideration of gravitational - strength scalar fields  @xcite such as kaluza - klein moduli or the dilaton appearing in the low energy limit of the gravitational sector leading to scalar - tensor theories of gravity .",
    "as explained above , the quintessence field is expected to be very light and this points toward scalar - tensor theories of gravity in which a light ( or massless ) scalar field can be present in the gravitational sector without being phenomenologically disastrous .",
    "these arguments lead to consider quintessence models in the framework of scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "indeed , the dilaton and the quintessence field can be two different scalar fields ( as considered , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite in the particular case of brans - dicke theory ) or the same scalar field .",
    "the latter subclass involving a single scalar field ( the quintessence field is also the dilaton ) dictating the time variation of both the gravitational constant and the cosmological constant is attractive ; it involves less free functions and has been focused on much in recent years .",
    "the study of these quintessence models , referred to as nonminimal quintessence  @xcite , coupled quintessence  @xcite , extended quintessence  @xcite or generalized quintessence  @xcite was mainly motivated by the fact that tracking solutions have been shown to exist for nonminimally coupled scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "scalar - tensor theories are the most natural extensions of general relativity , in particular they contain local lorentz invariance , constancy of nongravitational constants and respect the weak equivalence principle .",
    "the most general action for these theories  @xcite for the matter and gravity is given , in the jordan frame , by @xmath13 \\sqrt{-g } { { \\rm d}}^4 x , \\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the lagrangian of ordinary matter ( such as radiation and pressureless matter ) , @xmath15 is the determinant of the metric @xmath16 , @xmath17 the ricci scalar , and @xmath18 is a potential to be discussed below .",
    "the action  ( [ 1 ] ) depends _ a priori _ on three arbitrary functions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath21 is not a trivial function of @xmath17 then one has an additional ( massive ) scalar degree of freedom  @xcite so that the requirement that there is only one scalar partner to the graviton implies @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the bare newton constant .",
    "@xmath25 is a dimensionless function which needs to be positive to ensure that the graviton carries positive energy  @xcite .",
    "now , by a redefinition of @xmath26 we can always choose either @xmath27 or @xmath28 to be unity so that we are left with only two independent functions of the scalar field one being the potential @xmath18 .",
    "choosing @xmath29 , the effective ( time dependent ) constant is related to @xmath24 by @xmath30    as was explained above , authors first considered models with a nonminimally coupled scalar field  @xcite , i.e. , in which the function @xmath19 is decomposed as @xmath31 indeed , as long as we have not fixed the choice of the function @xmath32 , such a decomposition is completely general and always possible .",
    "if the normalization of @xmath32 is chosen in a way that @xmath33 today then @xmath34 gives an order of magnitude of the deviation with respect to general relativity today .",
    "due to the time variation of the gravitational constant , the strength of the coupling @xmath34 can be constrained once the function @xmath35 has be chosen .",
    "chiba  @xcite gave the constraints arising from the post - newtonian ( pn ) parameters and the time variation of @xmath24 for @xmath36 .",
    "in that case the deviation of the scalar - tensor theory from general relativity was fixed but , as pointed out by bartolo and pietroni  @xcite in scalar - tensor quintessence models a `` double attractor mechanism '' can happen , namely , of the scalar - tensor theory towards general relativity ( through the damour - nordtvedt mechanism  @xcite ) and of the quintessence field toward its tracking solution hence allowing for large deviation from general relativity in the early universe .",
    "note that in these models the dilaton is not completely stabilized and is slow rolling in its runaway potential .",
    "many works have then studied the cosmological implications of these models , starting from the study of the perturbations in brans - dicke theory  @xcite and for a nonminimally coupled scalar field  @xcite the computation of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies  @xcite , the properties of the nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "but among all , one of the very interesting results concerns the possibility to rule out some of these models  @xcite : it was shown that because of the positivity of the energy of the graviton , one can mimic a model in which the gravity is described by general relativity with a cosmological constant by a scalar - tensor theory with @xmath37 ( or when certain relation between @xmath18 and @xmath19 are set ) only in a certain range of redshift , hence offering a powerful test on a large class of scalar - tensor models .    in this article",

    "hence , the naive limit  ( [ bbn ] ) can be much more stringent than a detailed ( numerical ) study may show .",
    "as a first example , we consider the case of the nonminimally scalar field introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for which @xmath81 and we choose the function @xmath32 to be @xmath82    in fig .  [ fig0 ] , we depict the typical evolution of the equation of state parameter @xmath83 of the quintessence field and the time variation of the newton constant in the minimally coupled and nonminimally coupled cases . as explained in the appendices , the equation of state parameter of the quintessence field has two distinct contributions : @xmath84 that appears in the minimally coupled case , and an extra contribution @xmath85 that appears only in the non minimally coupled case . @xmath86 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 are related by @xmath87 it can be trivially checked that when the tracking solution is reached , @xmath88 now , a subtlety arises from the fact that depending on the sign of @xmath34 , the quantity @xmath48 can be negative . in this case , @xmath86 does not lie between @xmath85 and @xmath84 . with our conventions , @xmath48 and @xmath34",

    "one finds , however , that the field reaches planck values as it starts to dominate , i.e. , today .",
    "given the form of the coupling function  ( [ coupling2 ] ) , this means that all the departure from general relativity are mostly felt today .",
    "this also implies that these departures are stronger in the case of an inverse power - law than in the case of a sugra potential , mainly because in the latter case the potential is less steep ( due to the exponential term ) so that the scalar field is more stabilized and rolls down slower , implying a smaller time variation of the coupling function @xmath19 .",
    "another interesting feature lies in the fact that @xmath89 changes sign around @xmath90 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we sum up all the preceding constraints in the plane @xmath91 both for the inverse power law ( [ 01 ] ) and sugra potentials  ( [ sugra ] ) . since @xmath92 today , @xmath93 and @xmath34 is then a direct measurement of the deviation from general relativity today from which it follows that @xmath34 must be very small today ( as first pointed out in ref .",
    "the constraints are stronger for inverse power law potentials .",
    "this is easily understood if one notices that for small @xmath34 , the equation of state parameter @xmath20 is higher in the sugra case .",
    "this translates into a stronger time dependence of the quintessence field , which in turn puts more stringent constraints on the coupling between the scalar field and the metric .",
    "this remark therefore extends the bounds obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the most stringent constraint arises from the constraint on the post - newtonian parameter @xmath94 and all these constraints become stronger for high @xmath95 .",
    "another interesting point would be to study how these bounds depend on @xmath8 .",
    "for the ratra - peebles potential , this was already addressed in chiba s work : the bound on @xmath34 varies as @xmath96 , which can be checked numerically .",
    "for the sugra potential , the answer is even simpler : the dynamics of the quintessence field varies very weakly with @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the bound on @xmath34 are not significantly dependent on @xmath8 .      as a second example",
    ", we shall consider the class of scalar - tensor models in which the coupling function @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 with either the inverse power law or sugra potentials as defined in eqs .",

    "note that in this model , the constancy of @xmath108 requires that the coupling function @xmath19 is a polynomial of degree @xmath109 , exactly as in the first example .",

    "[ fig4 ] , we show the luminosity distance vs redshift relation for the two models presented above under the assumption that the universe is spatially flat ( i.e. , @xmath187 ) . in the case of the nonminimally coupled quintessence field , it can be noted that the deviation is more important for positive @xmath34 than for negative @xmath34 .",
    "note that in any case , the net effect of the coupling of the luminosity distance is small ( the most extreme values of @xmath34 and @xmath188 plotted here are already ruled out ) .",
    "however , when fitting the supernovae data , one must also take into account the change in the sn absolute luminosity , which can be as large as @xmath189 for the largest variation of @xmath24 allowed by nucleosynthesis .",
    "we also note that the distance vs redshift relation is more sensitive to the coupling @xmath34 for smaller values of the exponent @xmath8 . from the friedmann equation  ( [ 6 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , we have @xmath190 moreover , _ for constant @xmath26 _ , increasing @xmath34 increases @xmath19 , and therefore the distance traveled by a photon is increased .",
    "this explains why the quantity @xmath191 increases with @xmath34 in fig .",
    "unfortunately , the same reasoning does not apply for the exponential coupling because the hypothesis that the value of the quintessence field @xmath26 does not significantly vary at fixed redshift when one varies the parameter @xmath188 is no longer valid .",
    "( should the field be at rest today , then the hypothesis would still be valid , but this is not the case , as shown in figs .  [ fig0 ] and  [ figevc ] . )    in fig .",
    "[ fig4bis ] we present the distance modulus vs redshift relation taking into account the supernovae luminosity correction due to a variation of the newton constant .",
    "we compare the amplitude of this correction to the standard @xmath121cdm model .",
    "it appears that the allowed values for @xmath34 do not lead to a significant modification of the distance modulus .",
    "this is related to the fact that this model is very strongly constrained by the solar system data . on the contrary , the exponential coupling model allows for a larger deviation of the distance modulus , mainly because it is not limited by the post newtonian constraints .",
    "more generally , any model tuned so to evade the solar system constraints can lead to large deviation in the magnitude vs redshift relation .",
    "another important observational quantity is the angular distance , @xmath192 , which , with the notation of the previous paragraph , is given by  @xcite @xmath193 this distance relates the size of an object to the angle under which it is observed .",
    "naively , the variation of @xmath192 can be related to the position of the first cosmic microwave background acoustic peak .",
    "note also that @xmath194 also enters the probability of lensing  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we depict the variation of @xmath194 both in the nonminimally coupled scalar field models and in the exponential coupling case . indeed , a complete study of the cmb anisotropies will be presented in the following section and these results are just a hint of how the position of the first acoustic peak will be affected in these models . the relative shift in the position of the acoustic peaks",
    "is simply given by the asymptotic part of the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . as for the luminosity distance , the effect of the coupling is rather small .",
    "however , the variation of @xmath24 will lead to an important modification of the peak position as we shall see later .",
    "the background and perturbation equations in a scalar - tensor quintessence model are presented in the appendices . not that these equations are not restricted to the case of the nonminimally coupled scalar field and can be extended easily to the exponential coupling example by simply setting @xmath195 since , as emphasized in the introduction the splitting  ( [ 3 ] )",
    "is completely general as long as the function @xmath32 has not be chosen .",
    "technically , one obtains a set of equations slightly more complicated than in the minimally coupled case , but which can still easily be solved numerically .",
    "we shall first discuss the main properties of the scalar field perturbations before turning to cosmic microwave background properties in the next section .",
    "as for the minimally coupled case , one of the main concern is about the choice of initial conditions for the perturbations .",
    "it happens that this problem is not relevant since the long wavelength scalar field perturbations follow an attractor for the following reason .",
    "first , let us consider the unperturbed and perturbed klein - gordon equations @xmath196   & = & - \\xi ( a^2 r f '' \\delta \\phi + a^2 \\delta r f ' ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath197 is one the two bardeen potential and @xmath198 is a combination of the two bardeen potentials ( see the appendices for more details ) . for an inverse power law potential , one can show that there exists some particular solution to the unperturbed klein - gordon equation , the so - called tracking solution  @xcite , for which the field evolves according to some power law ( the exponent of which depends on the exponent of the potential ) . then , the stability of this particular solution  which is the most useful feature of the quintessence scenarios  is determined by the properties of the `` perturbed '' expression of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "this `` perturbed '' equation actually describes the small departures of an homogeneous field from its tracking solution , and reads @xmath199 obviously , this equation is extremely similar to the above `` real '' perturbed klein - gordon equation : we simply have neglected the metric perturbation terms , and considered the large wavelength limit @xmath200 .",
    "the very nice feature of inverse power law potential is that the solutions to this equation tend to 0 .",
    "therefore , the solutions of the homogeneous part of the real perturbed klein - gordon equation in the large wavelength limit tend to 0 .",
    "now , when one takes into account the metric perturbations , remembering the fact that they are constant in the long wavelength limit ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it appears that the relevant quantities , such as @xmath201 ( the density contrast of the quintessence fluid ) will tend toward constants which will simply be linear combinations of the metric perturbations . although not explicitly stated , this is what was shown in ref .",
    "finally , in the short wavelength limit , the laplacian term ensure that the field follows a wave equation , which is actually damped by the expansion .    as a conclusion ,",
    "as long as the field is subdominant ( which is the case when one fixes the initial conditions and in the tracking regimes ) , its perturbations follow an attractor , thus solving the problem of the choice of the initial conditions , and the field does not show any unstable behavior , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_last ] .",
    "appendix  [ c ] gives the derivation of the modified equations for the evolution of the cosmological perturbations .",
    "as explained in this appendix , the two most important modifications induced by the quintessence field are ( i ) a modification of the background equations which lead to the domination of the scalar field today and ( ii ) a subsequent modification of the late time evolution of the gravitational potentials .",
    "we have implemented the scalar - tensor quintessence equations in a boltzmann code ( which uses the line - of - sight integration method , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and computed matter power spectra as well as cmb anisotropies .",
    "we shall now discuss the observable consequences of these models .",
    "two effects of a quintessence ( minimally coupled or not ) have already widely been discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "these are the following :    * : by modifying the expansion rate of the universe at low redshift , the quintessence modifies the usual angular distance vs redshift relation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this induces a global shift of the acoustic peak structure .",
    "of course , if one adds a quintessence field while keeping fixed the hubble parameter today , then this is equivalent to modifying the redshift of equivalence between matter and radiation , which of course has some influence of the acoustic peak structure ( the same problem occurs for a cosmological constant ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we would have expected the first acoustic peak to be shifted to smaller multipoles since the diameter angular distance is smaller when @xmath202 .",
    "this is indeed not what is observed on fig .",
    "[ fign1 ] .",
    "this is because another , more important effect is that a variation of @xmath24 modifies the friedmann equation at _ early _ times , and therefore the age of the universe ( and , hence , the sound horizon ) is modified .",
    "for example , when @xmath202 , @xmath24 is larger at earlier time ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] ) , and the age of the universe is smaller at recombination , which shifts the peak structure towards higher angular scales . * : when the field starts to dominate , the density parameter of the ordinary matter decay , as well as the gravitational potential .",
    "this leads to the possibility of energy exchanges between photons and gravitational field , hence producing the so - called integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect which will boost the anisotropy spectrum of scales larger than the hubble radius at the epoch of transition between matter and quintessence .",
    "the cross correlation between the sachs - wolfe and the isw terms are difficult to compute , and , as long as the isw term is not too important , one can either have a higher or lower first peak .",
    "for any realistic model , the field is by far subdominant at recombination . as a consequence , the acoustic peak structure of the cmb anisotropies",
    "will not directly be affected by the field dynamic .",
    "however , two new effects arise when one introduces a non minimally coupled quintessence field :    * : at small scales , viscosity and heat conduction in the photon - baryon fluid produce a damping of the photon perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the damping scale is determined by the photon diffusion length at recombination , and therefore depends on the size of the horizon at this epoch , and hence , depends on any variation of the newton constant throughout the history of the universe . * : in the same vein , the duration of recombination is modified by a variation of the newton constant as the expansion rate is different .",
    "it is well known that cmb anisotropies are affected on small scales because the last scattering `` surface '' has a finite thickness .",
    "the net effect is to introduce an extra , roughly exponential , damping term , with the cutoff length being determined by the thickness of the last scattering surface  @xcite .",
    "this thickness is of course determined by the duration of the recombination process .",
    "this process is essentially fixed in redshift units , as it is dominated by boltzmann factors ( and hence , by photon temperature ) and not by standard cosmological parameters .",
    "however , when translating redshift into duration ( or length ) , one has to use the friedmann equations , which are affected by a variation of the newton constant . the relevant quantity to consider is the so - called visibility function @xmath15 , defined as @xmath203 with @xmath204 being the differential opacity , and @xmath205 . in the limit of an infinitely thin last scattering surface",
    ", @xmath152 goes from @xmath206 to @xmath59 at recombination epoch .",
    "for standard cosmology , it drops from a large value to a much smaller one , and hence , the visibility function still exhibits a peak , but is much broader .",
    "a few examples are given in fig .",
    "[ figvis ] for several values of the coupling parameter @xmath34 .",
    "as it can be seen , the height of the visibility function varies with @xmath34 , and therefore , its thickness also varies as the integral of this function is 1 . + * : as for the photon diffusion length , the sound horizon depends on the size of the horizon , at can significantly change if the newton constant is different from now at this epoch .",
    "the net effect is to produce a shift in the doppler peak structure .",
    "more quantitative estimates of all these four effects are difficult to compute analytically , since there is absolutely no reason that there exists any simple solutions to relevant equations .",
    "however , as already noted for the supernovae luminosity distance , the effect of the non minimal coupling one the angular size of the acoustic peaks is small , except for unacceptable large value of the parameters . on the contrary",
    ", the isw effect exhibits a much stronger dependence on @xmath34 and @xmath188 , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fign1 ] .",
    "one also notices significant modifications in the damping at high multipoles .    on fig .",
    "[ fign2 ] , we have plotted the corresponding matter power spectra .",
    "two important observable effect arise here .",
    "first , the normalization of the spectra changes because the usual sachs - wolfe formula @xmath207 which relates the cmb anisotropy to the matter power spectrum amplitudes does no longer hold because of the isw effect .",
    "this is particularly obvious for large , positive values of @xmath34 .",
    "second , the maximum of the power spectrum is shifted by the coupling .",
    "this is because this maximum give the scale that enters into the hubble radius at the epoch of equality between matter and radiation . in all the cases presented here",
    ", this epoch always corresponds to the same redshift but not to the same cosmic time because the friedmann equations are modified .",
    "therefore , the relation @xmath208 is different in all these models .    in practice , the power law coupling  ( [ coupling2 ] ) is already very strongly constrained by the pn parameters . for all acceptable values of the parameters ,",
    "the cmb anisotropies show a negligible deviation from the minimally coupled case ( note that on fig .",
    "[ fign2 ] , the plotted non zero values of @xmath34 are one order of magnitude larger than allowed values inferred from fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . on the contrary , for the exponential coupling where the pn constraints are fulfilled by construction",
    ", the cmb anisotropies can play a significant role in constraining ( or measuring ) the coupling parameters .",
    "in this article , we have investigated the interpretation of cosmological and astrophysical observations in the context of scalar - tensor quintessence . in this class of models ,",
    "the quintessence field induces a time variation of the gravitational constant and the post - newtonian constraints and the constraints on the time variation of the constants of nature where first imposed , as well as the restriction arising from nucleosynthesis .",
    "we then focused on the supernovae and cosmic microwave background dataset . concerning the supernovae",
    ", we extracted , using a simple toy model , the dependence of the maximum of the light curve on the gravitational constant .",
    "we also explained the various effects of this coupling ( mainly the modifications it induces of the newton constant ) on cmb anisotropies and structure formation .",
    "all these features on the cmb angular power spectrum and the matter power spectrum are physically well understood .",
    "all these observational constraints were applied all along the article to two class of models : ( i ) a nonminimally coupled quintessence field and ( ii ) and exponential coupling .",
    "we showed that the first class of models was very constrained mainly because the deviation from the general relativity was fixed and that the constraints were more severe in the case of an inverse power law potential than for the sugra potential .",
    "the second class seems to leave more freedom for parameters and could possibly be constrained using the cmb .",
