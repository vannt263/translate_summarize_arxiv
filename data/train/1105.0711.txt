    "this is relevant for the problem of confinement , a phase where the surface whose border is the wilson loop becomes observable .    in these scenarios , one of the difficulties",

    "the interesting point regarding this generalization is that it allows to relate the different phases of the vortex model with enabled or disabled large dual transformations @xcite , leading to decoupling of the wilson surfaces or turning them surface variables to be integrated together with the other fields , respectively .",
    "in this article , we have considered three dimensional @xmath0 yang - mills theory , and followed polymer techniques to derive a field representation of the partition function for the stringlike center vortices with monopoles at their borders . for this aim",
    ", we have assumed some phenomenological properties such as a vortex stiffness and vortex - vortex interactions .",
    "in addition , vortices naturally interact with the vector field @xmath26 that can be defined in yang - mills theories , and that can be thought of as a dual field describing the off - diagonal charged sector .    in @xmath0 , center vortices and monopoles carry magnetic charge @xmath203 and @xmath204 , respectively , so that configurations in the ensemble are formed by pairs of vortices attached to monopoles and antimonopoles .",
    "initially , we have been able to write the ensemble integration in terms of a buiding block @xmath98 , the weight to be ascribed to the path integral over a center vortex with fixed endpoints and variable length .",
    "then , the obtention of the effective theory becomes subject to the possibility of representing @xmath98 as a vortex field correlator . in the noninteracting case ,",
    "the field representation of the end - to - end probability for a single stiff polymer is originated from the knowledge of the momenta for this distribution , that permits to associate it with a random chain with an effective monomer size . in the interacting case",
    ", we had to adopt more recent techniques developed to study wormlike chains in terms of a fokker - plank equation , describing a diffusion @xmath205 not only in @xmath69-space ( the final end - point ) , but also in @xmath147-space ( the final orientation ) .",
    "after integrating over the lengths , initial and final orientations , we obtained an equation for @xmath98 , that can be approximated by disregarding components with angular momenta @xmath159 in the @xmath147-expansion of @xmath205 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a similar approximation has been implemented for the noninteracting string with stiffness , after associating it with the evolution of a `` rigid body '' in the tangent space .",
    "this can be justified for semiflexible vortices , as for long chains the probability distribution for the final orientation is expected to be nearly isotropic .    as a result of the approximation ,",
    "the weight @xmath98 turns out to be the green s function for a klein - gordon type operator @xmath206 where the usual derivative is replaced by a covariant one , that contains the dual vector field @xmath26 .",
    "finally , by representing this green s function by means of a complex vortex field , and analyzing the dominant terms originated from the functional determinant @xmath207 , we were able to perform the @xmath54 integration , thus obtaining in a controlled manner a recently proposed effective abelian model @xcite for three dimensional @xmath0 yang - mills theory . in this model ,",
    "the coupling with the dual vector field is essential to relate the possible phases of the vortex sector with enabled or disabled large dual transformations , thus permitting the decoupling , or not , of the wilson surface appearing in the petrov - diakonov representation of the wilson loop @xcite .",
    "this formalism could be extended to accommodate new symmetries such as isospin , and to obtain effective field theories for more complex systems containing extended objects .",
