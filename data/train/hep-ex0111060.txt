    "the development of hqet yields an expression for the @xmath70 decay rate in terms of a single unknown form factor .",
    "the form factor is parameterized in terms of @xmath71 , the inner product of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 four - velocities :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are masses of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 meson respectively and @xmath75 . here , and in what follows , @xmath76 stands for the four - momentum vector of the particle in subscript .",

    "@xmath83 is a short - distance correction arising from the finite qcd renormalization of the flavor - changing axial current at the point of zero recoil . the first order term in the non - perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath84 vanishes by virtue of luke s theorem  @xcite , and @xmath85 represents the second order correction .",
    "by contrast , the form factor of @xmath86 decay is not protectected against @xmath84 corrections at zero recoil  @xcite , hence the comparison of results from @xmath87 with @xmath86  @xcite-@xcite provides some measure of the size of corrections to hqet .",

    "the charge conjugate mode is implicitly included .",
    "for this precise measurement we use @xmath4 and not @xmath94 since the electron identification efficiency plateau has a wider range in both momentum and polar angle than that of muons , leading to a better control of systematic uncertainties .",
