    "the cell membrane is a complex bilayer sheet consisting of hundreds of lipid species embedded with numerous surface- and trans - membrane proteins.@xcite its main role is to separate the cell s interior from its surroundings and to act as a conduit for exchanging matter and signaling between the cell and its environment .",
    "the cell membrane is a dynamic object whose conformational variations are associated with biological activities such as cell fission , fusion , and adsorption.@xcite most biological membranes exist in a liquid state where lipid molecules are rather strongly confined to the bilayer plane but can easily diffuse laterally within it .",
    "fluidity allows the membrane to dynamically rearrange its local composition , quickly heal holes , and enable transmembrane transport besides allowing other metabolic functions .",
    "a substantial portion of the transport through the cell membrane takes place via pores.@xcite the presence of a pore changes the topology of a membrane and can significantly influence its conformations and functions.@xcite characterizing the conformations of closed membranes has been a subject of active research over the past four decades with numerous experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite studies .    despite a high molecular complexity , when the length scale is large compared to the bilayer thickness and the energy scale is small compared to the typical intermolecular interactions , the cell membrane shape can be successfully described by a simple model proposed by helfrich nearly forty years ago.@xcite in his seminal paper , helfrich argued that the low - energy large - scale properties of a liquid membrane can be described in terms of a free energy that is a quadratic function of the two principal curvatures expressed in terms of their two invariants : the mean curvature and the gaussian curvature . within the framework of the helfrich theory , various axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric shapes of closed membranes",
    "have been predicted.@xcite in particular , the longstanding physiological puzzle about the biconcave shape typical of the red blood cell has been beautifully solved ; the shape of the red blood cell shape has been understood as the conformation that minimizes the helfrich free energy under a set of prescribed volume and area constraints.@xcite many predictions based on the helfrich free energy have been observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite for example , the theoretical discovery of the thermal repulsion between membranes , that is to prevent sticking of cells , has been confirmed by small angle x - ray diffraction experiment.@xcite    there are various ways to form pores on membranes _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro_. for example , pore - forming toxin proteins exist in a wide range of organisms including bacteria , fungi , plant and animal cells.@xcite by binding at particular sites on a membrane , toxins can create pores via oligomerizing on the membrane surface .",
    "the pores created by toxin proteins are of limited sizes .",
    "for example , the maximum size of the pore formed by secyeg on e. coli is below @xmath0.@xcite recent studies have shown that larger pores can be created on a fluid membrane by detergents@xcite or submembranous protein talin.@xcite note that the size of the pore is controlled by tuning the talin concentration over an appropriate range.@xcite the localization of talin mainly along the pore rim , as observed by fluorescent labelling , is likely responsible for stabilizing the pore .",
    "a recent experiment introduced a method to create pores of about @xmath1 in a lipid membrane.@xcite in a salt - free catanionic solution , charged pores are produced on membranes due to the partial segregation of the anionic surfactant in excess . in this case , the size of a pore can be controlled by tuning the relative amount of anionic and cationic surfactants and thus the charges on a pore .",
    "the size of a stable pore is determined by the competition of the line tension energy @xmath2 and the electrostatic self - energy @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the line tension , @xmath5 is the size of the pore , @xmath6 is the total charge on the pore and @xmath7 is the dielectric constant of the medium , such that @xmath8 .",
    "both the increase of charge and the decrease of line tension can enlarge a pore on membrane .    in this paper , we study how a pore modifies the morphology of a fluid membrane within the framework of the helfrich theory .",
    "we discuss the equilibrium solutions of the helfrich shape equation for fluid membranes with fixed area and pore size . in experiments",
    "the fixed pore size constraint can be realized by introducing stabilizing agents as discussed above .",
    "we find a budding structure in pored membranes , dictated by the mean curvature term in the helfrich free energy . in studies of the conformation of closed single - component liquid membranes ,",
    "the gaussian curvature term in the helfrich free energy can be omitted , as it is a constant that does not depend on the membrane s shape .",
    "however , this is no longer the case if pores are present .",
    "we show that the gaussian curvature term can significantly influence the shape of a pored membrane by imposing a local constraint on the shape of the membrane near the pore .",
    "the gaussian curvature term tends to pull the membrane outside a pore to the plane where the pore loop lies and the membrane near the pore is flattened .",
    "this observation may lead to a simple method to fabricate polyhedral buckled membranes by manipulating the size and position of the pores .",
    "in addition , we propose a scheme to find the ratio of the gaussian rigidity and the bending rigidity from the shape of a pored membrane .",
    "this ratio is usually difficult to measure experimentally.@xcite the proposed scheme successfully passes the test on a pored membrane generated by surface evolver,@xcite and is applied on an experimental case .",
    "furthermore , we briefly discuss the stability of a pore on a membrane by relaxing the constraint of fixed pore size and adding the line tension .",
    "we find that a budding pore may be meta - stable with very shallow energy barrier and over a very narrow range of values of line tension .",
    "therefore , stabilizing agents like talin proteins in the experiment of ref .",
    "are essential for a stable pore on fluid membranes .",
    "finally , the flattening effect due to the gaussian curvature as found in studying pored membranes is extended to two - component membranes .",
    "multicomponent membranes can have a wide variety of morphologies , as has been recently discussed for both liquid@xcite and polymerized membranes.@xcite we find that the flattening effect due to the gaussian curvature can induce budding in two - component membranes when there is sufficiently high contrast between the components gaussian rigidities .",

    "<S> we study the shapes of pored membranes within the framework of the helfrich theory under the constraints of fixed area and pore size . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the mean curvature term leads to a budding - like structure , while the gaussian curvature term tends to flatten the membrane near the pore ; this is corroborated by simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a scheme to deduce the ratio of the gaussian rigidity to the bending rigidity simply by observing the shape of the pored membrane . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is usually difficult to measure experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we briefly discuss the stability of a pore by relaxing the constraint of a fixed pore size and adding the line tension . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the flattening effect due to the gaussian curvature as found in studying pored membranes is extended to two - component membranes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that sufficiently high contrast between the components gaussian rigidities leads to budding which is distinct from that due to the line tension . </S>"
