    "the majority of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are found in giant galaxies with substantial bulges , and there is a dramatic drop in the agn fraction for late hubble types @xcite and for host galaxies with stellar masses below @xmath7 @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this trend is consistent with the generally accepted scenario in which black hole growth and bulge growth are closely coupled , as expected from the correlations between black hole mass and bulge mass @xcite , and between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion ( the @xmath9  relation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the low agn fraction in late - type and low - mass galaxies arises from a combination of factors .",
    "perhaps most important , the black hole occupation fraction in low - mass galaxies is apparently below unity , as demonstrated by the stellar - dynamical non - detections of central black holes in the local group galaxies m33 @xcite and ngc 205 @xcite . for those late - type galaxies that do contain a central black hole , shallow central gravitational potential wells may lead to a low efficiency for fueling black hole accretion . a low - mass black hole ( @xmath10 @xmath8 ) ,",
    "even if radiating at its eddington rate , can not produce a very luminous agn , and such objects can only be readily detected as agns if they are fairly nearby . in optical surveys , dust extinction and blending with circumnuclear star - forming regions",
    "can further hinder the detection of low - luminosity active nuclei in late - type spirals .",
    "if the @xmath9  relation continues toward low masses , then a black hole of @xmath11 @xmath8  would correspond to a host galaxy velocity dispersion of @xmath12 km s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "thus , to explore the intermediate - mass regime for black holes , it is particularly interesting to search for agn host galaxies having @xmath13 km s@xmath2 .",
    "such objects are known to exist , but they are rare . prior to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , there were only two nearby examples of dwarf galaxies known to contain seyfert 1 nuclei : pox 52 , a de galaxy with @xmath14 km s@xmath2@xcite , and ngc 4395 , an sd - type spiral with a central velocity dispersion of @xmath15 km s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the availability of sdss has made it possible for the first time to search systematically for more examples of agns with low - mass black holes and small central velocity dispersions .",
    "greene & ho ( 2004 ; hereinafter gh04 ) carried out the first such survey using data release 1 of the sdss , identifying 19 seyfert 1 galaxies as likely candidates for having @xmath16 @xmath8 .",
    "although host galaxy properties were not considered in the sample selection , the hosts for this sample turned out to be galaxies of relatively low luminosity , on average about 1 mag fainter than @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite measured stellar velocity dispersions for many of the galaxies in this sample and found that they are also low ( @xmath18 km s@xmath2 ) and fall close to the local @xmath9  relation extrapolated toward lower masses .",
    "most previous searches for low - mass agns have concentrated on type 1 ( broad - lined ) objects ( greene & ho 2004 , 2007 ; dong et al .  2006 ) because the broad - line widths and agn continuum luminosity can be used to estimate the black hole mass . however , at low luminosities , most seyferts are type 2 objects @xcite , and a full determination of the demographics of agns with low - mass black holes must take into account the type 2 population . furthermore , without the glare of a bright agn point source , the host galaxies of seyfert 2s are more easily studied .",
    "this can make it possible to examine the central stellar populations and star formation histories of seyfert 2 host galaxies in a level of detail that would be impossible for type 1 agns @xcite .",
    "since searches for broad - lined agns require both the flux and the width of a broad emission line ( such as h@xmath19 ) to be above some detection threshold , surveys for type 2 agns based on measurements of narrow emission lines can potentially probe lower agn luminosities , and therefore may be sensitive to agns in smaller host galaxies , or containing black holes of lower mass than those that can be found in seyfert 1 surveys .",
    "optical spectroscopic surveys such as the palomar survey @xcite have previously identified some examples of very low - luminosity seyfert 2 nuclei in late - type galaxies , such as the sc galaxy ngc 1058 , which has a central velocity dispersion of only @xmath20 km s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "other strategies for finding obscured agns , such as mid - infrared searches for high - ionization coronal line emission from obscured active nuclei @xcite , have contributed further evidence for black holes in late - type spirals . since stellar - dynamical searches for low - mass black holes",
    "are limited to very nearby galaxies ( within a few mpc at best ) , agn surveys remain the best way to examine the demographics of these objects , and to determine the properties of the host galaxies in which low - mass black holes form and grow .",
    "this paper describes new observations of a set of seyfert 2 galaxies selected from data release 2 of the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sdss dr2 ) to have host galaxies with relatively low luminosities and small central velocity dispersions .",
    "we select galaxies spectroscopically identified as having seyfert 2 nuclei ( rather than liner or agn / starburst transition or composite types ) , in order to focus on objects having nuclear emission - line spectra that are clearly and unambiguously dominated by an accretion - powered agn .",
    "these galaxies are in many respects type 2 counterparts of the low - mass seyfert 1 sample found by gh04 , although the two samples are selected by very different criteria .",
    "most of the objects in both of these samples are not small or faint enough to be considered dwarf galaxies , but the objects described here are sub-@xmath17  galaxies that occupy ranges in mass , luminosity , and central velocity dispersion where very few type 2 agns were known before sdss .",
    "we present measurements of the properties of these galaxies from high - resolution spectra taken at the keck observatory .",
    "the small - aperture , high - resolution keck spectra make it possible to confirm the agn classification of these galaxies , to detect weak emission - line features and search for faint broad - line components , to measure stellar velocity dispersions , and to fully resolve the profiles of the narrow emission lines and measure accurate linewidths .",
    "we discuss the properties of these galaxies and the seyfert 1s from the gh04 sample in the context of unified models of agns .",
    "we also describe a search for polarized broad - line and continuum emission in four of these low - mass seyfert 2 galaxies . in this paper , distance - dependent quantities",
    "are calculated assuming @xmath21 km s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 , @xmath22 = 0.3 , and @xmath23 .",
    "our goal for this project was to identify seyfert 2 galaxies having low velocity dispersions , as type 2 counterparts to the seyfert 1 galaxies identified by gh04 .",
    "we initially searched the sdss dr2 archives for narrow emission - line galaxies at @xmath24 with emission - line ratios matching a seyfert 2 classification ( as described below ) , and host galaxies with absolute magnitude fainter than @xmath25 mag . in the gh04 seyfert 1 sample , the host galaxy absolute magnitudes ranged from @xmath26 to @xmath27 mag with a median of @xmath28 mag .",
    "the line - ratio selection was based on two criteria : @xmath29/\\mathrm{h}\\beta ) > 0.61 /      \\{\\log([\\mathrm{n~ii}]/\\mathrm{h}\\alpha ) - 0.47\\ } + 1.19,\\ ] ] and @xmath30 / \\mathrm{h}\\beta > 3,\\ ] ] where [ ] and [ ] refer to the fluxes of the [ ] @xmath31 and [ ] @xmath32 emission lines , respectively .",
    "the first criterion represents the `` maximum starburst line '' of @xcite , which separates the region and agn branches of a @xcite `` bpt '' diagnostic diagram .",
    "the location of this maximum starburst line was slightly modified in later work by @xcite and @xcite , but our sample is not affected by this change . the second criterion was used to identify high - excitation seyfert galaxies and exclude liners or objects with liner/ transition - type spectra , following traditional classification criteria @xcite .",
    "after we had begun some initial keck observations , the sdss dr2 galaxy catalogs of g. kauffmann and collaborators ( the mpa / jhu catalogs ) , based on work described by @xcite , became available to the public .",
    "the mpa / jhu agn catalogs include narrow emission - line galaxies falling above and to the right of the maximum starburst line in the [ ] /h@xmath33  vs. [ ] /h@xmath19  diagram , so their agn samples contain both seyferts and liners . for a description of their agn sample selection and classification criteria ,",
    "see @xcite , which was based on the sdss dr1 sample .",
    "we then used these catalogs to select further candidates , and most of the objects we had initially selected from the sdss archives were included in the mpa / jhu dr2 agn sample .",
    "the mpa / jhu catalogs are an excellent resource for statistical studies of nearby narrow - line agn populations , because of the very large sample size ( 33,589 agns in dr2 and 88,178 in the later dr4 catalog ) and the inclusion of additional data on the host galaxies including stellar masses , stellar velocity dispersions , and the absorption - line indices h@xmath34  and @xmath35 , which are sensitive to the galaxy s star formation history ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) . to ensure that our sample contained galaxies with well - determined agn classifications",
    ", we further selected only galaxies having measurements of [ ] flux with s / n@xmath36 based on the dr2 emission line catalog .",
    "several of the objects in our sample have also been previously identified as seyferts based on sdss spectra by @xcite , but a literature search revealed that only two galaxies in our sample ( 1440 + 0247 and 1032 + 6502 ) were identified as agns prior to the sdss .",
    "a few cases of galaxies with possible broad h@xmath19  emission lines , that otherwise met our selection criteria , were included in the sample .",
    "as described below , we used the keck spectra to test the reality of the broad - line emission .",

    "the redshifts range from @xmath37 to 0.0712 , with a median of 0.042 . since the size of this keck sample",
    "was determined by the available telescope time and the practical need to observe objects distributed over a range of right ascension , the set of objects in this study is not a statistically complete sample , but they should be generally representative of the small population of seyfert 2 nuclei in sub-@xmath17  host galaxies in sdss . in table",

    "we note that the absolute magnitudes listed in table [ sample ] are based on the sdss petrosian magnitudes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for most objects in this sample",
    ", the petrosian aperture magnitudes agreed to within @xmath41 mag with the `` model '' magnitudes based on the best - fitting de vaucouleurs or exponential model .",
    "the magnitudes are not corrected for internal extinction , since for most objects in the sample there is insufficient morphological information to make such a correction .    for the objects selected from the mpa / jhu dr2 catalog , the host galaxy stellar masses ranged from @xmath42 to 10.5 , with a median value of 9.8 .",
    "although the mpa / jhu dr2 and dr4 agn catalogs contain a substantial number of agn candidates with extremely low stellar masses ( i.e. , below @xmath43 @xmath8 ) , we found that the vast majority of these objects do not satisfy the selection criteria given above .",
    "the mpa / jhu dr2 agn catalog contained 90 objects with @xmath44 and 17 with @xmath45 .",
    "inspection of the sdss spectra of these objects revealed that most of them have liner or transition - type spectra , or very weak emission lines with such low equivalent width that the agn classification is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "there were also a few cases of nearby giant galaxies ( including ngc 5775 and ngc 3166 ) being listed in the agn catalog with very low host galaxy masses of @xmath46 .",
    "these appear to be objects for which the sdss catalog magnitudes include only the galaxy s nucleus , resulting in a severe underestimate of the total stellar mass .",
    "the situation for the dr4 agn catalog is similar : at @xmath46 , there are 52 objects in this catalog , most of which are either liner or transition - type objects , objects with emission lines of very low equivalent width , or large nearby galaxies with incorrect total magnitudes .",
    "only a small fraction of the objects in this mass range ( @xmath47 ) would satisfy our seyfert selection criteria .",
    "thus , the population statistics of agns with extremely low - mass host galaxies in these catalogs should be treated with some caution .",
    "the spectroscopic observations described here were obtained with the esi spectrograph @xcite on the keck - ii telescope . most of the this sample was observed during 2005 may 1617 , with a few objects observed during runs on 2003 november 2324 and 2004 october 910 .",

    "the slit was held at a fixed position angle during each observation , corresponding approximately to the parallactic angle for the midpoint of the exposure .",
    "exposure times for the galaxies ranged from 900 to 3600 s ( table [ esidata ] ) .",
    "seeing was mostly in the range 0710 .",
    "one or more flux standards were observed during each night , and several velocity template stars of spectral type ranging from g8iii to k4iii , and also a few a0v stars , were observed during twilight . for wavelength calibration , exposures of hgne , xe , and cuar comparison lamp spectra were taken .",
    "the spectra were bias - subtracted , flattened , and extracted with a fixed extraction width of 1 .",
    "standard ( not optimally weighted ) extractions were used , because optimal extraction routines tend to truncate the peaks of emission - line profiles when the emission - line regions have a different spatial extent from the stellar continuum .",
    "the extracted spectra for the individual echelle orders were wavelength - calibrated and flux - calibrated , and corrected for telluric absorption by dividing by a normalized spectrum of a white dwarf star observed on the same night .",
    "error spectra were also extracted and propagated through the full sequence of calibrations .",
    "finally , the 10 echelle orders were combined into a single spectrum for each galaxy , using a weighted average to combine the overlap regions between orders .",
    "systematic offsets between the flux scales of adjacent orders within the overlap regions were typically smaller than 2.5% .",

    "calibrations were performed using observations of polarized and unpolarized standards @xcite , and flux standard stars observed during twilight . data reduction and polarization analysis followed the methods outlined by @xcite , using a 3-wide spectral extraction . the null standard star hd 57702",
    "was found to be unpolarized to within @xmath51 in both the blue and red side extractions , in close agreement with other recent measurements done with lrisp @xcite .",
    "before measurement of the emission lines from the esi spectra , we applied a simple starlight subtraction procedure to remove the stellar continuum from each spectrum .",
    "the fitting routine used a linear combination of two stellar templates , a k giant and an a0v star , from the library of stellar spectra observed on the same nights as the galaxies .",
    "a featureless , power - law continuum component was added , and the continuum was velocity - broadened by convolution with a gaussian kernel and fitted to the galaxy spectrum using a levenberg - marquardt minimization routine .",
    "the free parameters in the fit included the normalization of the two stellar spectra and the featureless continuum , the stellar velocity dispersion , the power - law index of the featureless continuum , and the reddening ( assuming a galactic extinction law ) .",
    "spectral regions containing emission lines were masked out in the fit .",
    "this procedure was repeated for each galaxy using several different late - type giant stars and a0v stars to find the best - fitting combination . while the starlight - subtracted spectra of some galaxies still contained broad residual features or small jumps at the boundaries between echelle orders ,",
    "this procedure generally yielded a good fit to the continuum shape and the strong stellar features over the region @xmath52  , as illustrated in figure [ starsub ] .",
    "although these fits give an estimate of the stellar velocity dispersion , better measurements of the velocity dispersions are determined from fits to smaller spectral windows in individual echelle orders containing strong absorption - line features ( as described below ) , and we used these global fits primarily for purposes of starlight subtraction to obtain the emission - line spectra .",
    "the fluxes of the h@xmath19 , h@xmath33 , [ ] @xmath31 , [ ] @xmath53 , [ ] @xmath54 , and [ ] @xmath55 emission lines were measured by gaussian fitting to the line profiles in the starlight - subtracted spectra .",
    "each line was first fit with a single gaussian component , and if there were significant systematic residuals , a second gaussian component was added .",

    ", four objects appeared to be likely or possible candidates for having broad h@xmath19emission , and we used a single gaussian component to fit the broad line ( figure [ broadhal ] ) .",
    "two of the broad h@xmath19  candidates were the two objects that were not selected from the mpa / jhu catalog : 1032 + 6502 and 1440 + 0247 . in the case of 1032 + 6502 ,",
    "inspection of the starlight - subtracted esi spectrum clearly confirms the reality of the broad h@xmath19  feature , and the broad component in the esi data has fwhm = @xmath56 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the result of the model fit for 1440 + 0247 is somewhat more ambiguous .",
    "a fit using a double - gaussian narrow - line model left very weak residuals in the wings of h@xmath19 but the residuals only extended in wavelength as far as the gaps between h@xmath19and the [ ] lines on either side . adding a broad h@xmath19component",
    "marginally improved the quality of the fit , and the best - fitting model had a broad component width of fwhm = @xmath57 km s@xmath2 . given the narrowness and low amplitude of this possible broad component , it is not clear whether this represents emission from a distinct broad - line region ( blr ) , and we consider it a tentative detection at most .",
    "the other two broad h@xmath19  candidates were selected from the mpa / jhu catalog .",
    "the first , 0110 + 0026 has an obvious and strong broad h@xmath19emission line that is clearly visible in the sdss spectrum and confirmed in the esi data , with fwhm = @xmath58 km s@xmath2 .",

    "the agn classifications are essentially unchanged between the sdss 3-diameter fiber measurements and the keck @xmath59 aperture extractions . in the smaller keck aperture , only one object falls just slightly below our [ ] /h@xmath33  selection threshold .    in the diagram of [ ] /h@xmath33  vs.  [ ] /h@xmath19 ,",

    "since the individual esi spectra have rather low s / n at the blue and red ends , we created a composite seyfert 2 spectrum by summing the individual spectra ( excluding the three objects with definite or possible broad h@xmath19  emission ) , corrected for galactic extinction and weighted by the s / n of each spectrum .",

    "most of the narrow - line profiles were well described by a narrow core component plus a low - amplitude , blueshifted `` wing '' component .",
    "the wing component was found to be redshifted relative to the core in only 6% of the objects .",
    "in contrast , our sample seems to have an unusually large fraction of objects with redward asymmetries .",
    "eight objects , or 28% of the sample , have red - asymmetric profiles , in the sense of having a single dominant peak with an excess of flux on the red side of the peak relative to the blue side . some other objects ( such as 1112 + 5529 and 1432 + 0046 ) have profiles that are well fit by the double - gaussian model but for which the model components can not be individually labeled as core or wing components , because the broader component contains the majority of the line flux and the velocity difference between the two components is small .",
    "either blueward or redward asymmetries can be interpreted as resulting from radial motion ( inflow or outflow ) of clouds combined with the presence of dust , either within the clouds themselves or in a surrounding medium . in the more common situation of blueward asymmetries ,",
    "a likely explanation is outflowing motion of clouds in a dusty medium , in which the redshifted clouds on the far side of the galaxy nucleus are behind a larger absorbing column of dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , there are possible geometric arrangements of an outflow and dust screen that would lead to a redward asymmetry as well , if the outflow direction is not restricted to be perpendicular to the plane of the dust screen .",
    "alternatively , if the dust is contained within the nlr clouds themselves , then the emission from a cloud would be strongest in the direction facing the central ionizing source , and in an outflow we would have a more direct view of the ionized faces of the redshifted clouds on the far side of the nucleus , rather than the ionized faces of the blueshifted clouds , leading to a redward asymmetry on the line profiles . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", the line profiles do not contain sufficient information to uniquely determine the kinematic state of the nlr or the distribution of dust within it .",
    "more surprising is the detection of double - peaked forbidden - line profiles in three objects .",
    "two galaxies , 0343@xmath700735 and 1006 + 4456 , have fairly symmetric double - peaked [ ] profiles with well - resolved peaks .",
    "the peak - to - peak velocity separation of the two components in these objects is 115 and 275 km s@xmath2 , respectively .",

    "the @xcite study found double - peaked profiles in only about 1% of sdss seyfert 2 spectra .",
    "the relatively high incidence of double - peaked profiles in this sample likely results from a combination of the high spectral resolution of esi , the smaller spectroscopic aperture of the keck observations , and the low intrinsic linewidths for the individual velocity components in these low - mass galaxies . in the sdss spectra ,",
    "velocity splittings much smaller then the instrumental fwhm of @xmath76 km s@xmath2  would be unresolved , and only one of these four objects ( 1006 + 4456 ) exhibits double - peaked lines in the lower - resolution sdss data .",
    "the sdss spectrum for 1629 + 4254 shows a single - peaked but strongly red - asymmetric [ ] profile .",

    "the possibility of a disklike nlr would be difficult to test directly by spatially resolved kinematics or morphology , however , since the diameter of such a disk would be too small to resolve directly in these galaxies .    the linewidths for [ ] were characterized by two different quantities : the line dispersion ( that is , the second moment of the line profile ) and the full - width at half - maximum . given the limited s / n in the profile wings in some objects , we chose to measure the linewidth parameters from the fitted model profile rather than from the data itself , following methods similar to those used by @xcite .",
    "the line dispersion is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the flux - weighted mean wavelength of the emission line .",

    "noise was then added to match the s / n of the original spectrum , and the simulated profile was fitted in the same manner as the original spectrum . the uncertainty on the line dispersion or fwhm was then taken to be the standard deviation of linewidth values measured from the set of simulated profiles .",

    "when visible in the spectra or in the fit residuals , emission lines such as [ ] @xmath89 were masked out from the fits .",

    "thus , the detected polarization almost certainly arises within the host galaxy , but the limited s / n and lack of any polarized line features does not permit a clear interpretation of its physical origin . electron scattering or dust scattering of a hidden agn continuum could be responsible for the observed polarization . if the electron scattering mirror were located interior to the narrow - line region then the narrow emission lines should have a lower polarization than the surrounding continuum .",
    "this is not observed in our data , but would be testable with higher s / n observations .",
    "polarization by transmission through foreground dust in the host galaxy is an alternative possibility , and is the dominant polarization mechanism in some low - luminosity agns with high internal extinction such as ngc 3718 @xcite .",

    "nondetections of polarized emission lines or continuum in seyfert 2 galaxies are unfortunately difficult to interpret ; possible explanations include lack of a blr , lack of a suitable scattering mirror , foreground dust absorption covering the host galaxy s nucleus , or contamination by starlight that dilutes the strength of a scattered - light polarization signal . in starlight - dominated agns with hidden blrs , the broad - line polarization is often @xmath139 above the continuum polarization @xcite , and the s / n of these observations is too low to detect such weak polarized line features .",

    "the largest deviation above the extrapolated @xmath9  relation is found for 1440 + 0247 , which lies approximately an order of magnitude higher than the tremaine et al .",
    "@xmath9  relation extrapolated to @xmath181 km s@xmath2 .",
    "given the substantial uncertainties in the [ ] bolometric correction , these lower limits to @xmath163  should be viewed cautiously on a case - by - case basis , but on the whole these results are consistent with expectations for a sample of black holes of relatively low mass in which many of the black holes are undergoing a significant accretion episode .",
    "these seyfert 2 galaxies and the gh04 seyfert 1 objects do not constitute perfectly matched samples in terms of their nuclear or host galaxy properties , as a result of the very different selection criteria that were used for the two samples .",
    "nevertheless , the two samples do occupy similar and overlapping ranges in some key parameters . as shown in figure [ hostcompare ] , the distributions of @xmath38-band absolute magnitudes are overlapping but not identical ; the seyfert 2s were selected based on an absolute magnitude cut and all have @xmath182 mag , while the gh04 objects were selected without regard to host galaxy properties , and their distribution extends to slightly more luminous galaxies , up to @xmath183 .",
    "the gh04 sample also does not contain any host galaxies as faint as the least luminous seyfert 2 galaxy in this sample , 1109 + 6123 , with @xmath184 . in terms of [ ] luminosity , which is the best available indicator of total agn luminosity , the two samples occupy overlapping ranges with most galaxies in the range @xmath185}}}\\sim 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 8 $ ] @xmath186 ; again , the type 1 sample extends to slightly higher luminosities and the type 2 sample extends to lower luminosities , with the galaxy 1109 + 6123 falling at the low - luminosity end of the distribution .    although the narrow - line ratios of the two samples occupy overlapping ranges , as seen in figure [ bptdiagrams ] , there are some key differences between the type 1 and type 2 objects . from inspection of figure [ bptdiagrams ] ,",
    "it is evident that the seyfert 2 galaxies from this sample have somewhat lower values of [ ] /h@xmath33  on average than the gh04 sample .",
    "the median values of [ ] /h@xmath33  are 7.9 and 4.9 for the type 1 and type 2 samples respectively , and a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test confirms that the two distributions are significantly different , with a 1.4% probability of being drawn from the same parent population .",
    "we also examine the [ ] @xmath187/[]@xmath31 ratio for the two samples , measured from the sdss spectra since the esi spectra do not cover [ ] @xmath187 for most objects ( see figure [ hostcompare ] ) .",
    "the type 1 and type 2 objects have median values for [ ] / [ ] of 0.23 and 0.61 , respectively .",
    "a k - s test shows that the two distributions of [ ] / [ ] have only a @xmath188 probability of being drawn from the same parent population .",
    "the higher [ ] / [ ] ratio in the type 2 objects is intriguing in light of similar trends found recently among high - luminosity agns .",
    "@xcite showed that among the pg quasar sample , the [ ] / [ ] ratio is generally consistent with that expected from agn photoionization , with no evidence for an additional contribution to the [ ] emission from star - forming regions .",
    "following up on this study , @xcite found that luminous type 2 agns from sdss such as those found by @xcite have enhanced levels of [ ] emission relative to what is seen in a corresponding type 1 agn sample from sdss , possibly indicating an elevated rate of star formation in the type 2 objects compared to the type 1 objects .",
    "this observation presents a strong challenge to the simplest unified models , in which type 1 and type 2 agns differ only by orientation and obscuration of the central engine .",
    "the low - mass seyfert 2 hosts evidently follow the same trend of enhanced [ ] emission : the median values of log([]/h@xmath33 ) and log([]/ [ ] ) for the type 2 objects in this sample are 0.69 and @xmath189 , respectively , which fall remarkably close to the values for these line ratios measured from the composite type 2 quasar spectrum of @xcite , as displayed in figure 7 of @xcite .",
    "the lower [ ] /h@xmath33  ratios among the seyfert 2 sample could be another manifestation of a larger contribution of star - forming regions to the spectra , although another possibility is that the seyfert 2 galaxies have slightly lower nlr ionization parameter than the gh04 seyfert 1 galaxies .    aside from the question of the relative amounts of star formation in the type 1 and type 2 samples ,",
    "the more fundamental unification question remains : do they all have intrinsically similar central engines , in which case the presence or absence of broad emission lines would depend primarily on their orientation and the degree of obscuration along our line of sight ? or , alternatively , are some of the type 2 objects `` true '' type 2 agns that intrinsically lack a blr ? there is growing observational evidence that at low luminosities , there is a population of seyfert 2 galaxies that do not exhibit polarized broad - line emission or x - ray absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the line of sight to the nucleus is unobscured and the blr is not present .",
    "one scenario to explain true seyfert 2 nuclei has been proposed by @xcite ; in this model , the blr consists of an accretion disk wind and when @xmath173/@xmath174  falls below a critical value of @xmath190 , the luminosity is insufficient for the disk to form a radiation - pressure dominated region from which to launch the wind . in another model proposed by @xcite ,",
    "there is a maximum blr linewidth of @xmath191 km s@xmath2  above which the blr clouds do not survive , and there is a critical luminosity below which the blr radius shrinks to a size where the corresponding keplerian velocities exceed this maximum linewidth . at present",
    "it is not completely clear whether @xmath173  or @xmath173/@xmath174  is the primary parameter that determines whether a blr forms ( or whether there may be some additional key parameter ) , and further exploration of the properties of the least luminous seyfert 2 galaxies is needed in order to resolve this question . as described above , most of our sample consists of objects with relatively high @xmath173/@xmath174 , and with @xmath173  in the range @xmath192 ergs s@xmath2 ; in both the @xcite and @xcite scenarios these objects would be above the critical luminosity or eddington ratio needed to support blrs .",
    "a closely related question is the nature of the obscuring torus in unified models of agns and whether the properties or existence of the torus depends on agn luminosity or other properties .",
    "one attractive possibility for the origin of the obscuring torus is that it may be the dusty component of a wind driven from the surface of the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have recently examined the dynamics of hydromagnetic disk winds and the dependence of outflow properties on the agn luminosity .",
    "a key prediction of their model is that for agn luminosities below @xmath193 ergs s@xmath2 , the agn is not powerful enough to sustain the torus wind , and the torus should therefore not be present in very low - luminosity agns . while most of our sample is more luminous than this threshold , the least luminous object in our sample ( 1109 + 6123 ) presents a particularly interesting test case .",
    "its narrow - line spectrum and host galaxy are nearly identical to ngc 4395 (  [ individualobjects ] ) , and it is the best type 2 counterpart to ngc 4395 known .",
    "ngc 4395 has a bolometric luminosity of @xmath194 ergs s@xmath2  @xcite , more than an order of magnitude below the typical cutoff luminosity for a wind - driven torus in the elitzur & shlosman model .",
    "while the bolometric luminosity of sdss 1109 + 6123 is unknown , its [ ] luminosity is about 40% smaller than that of ngc 4395 .",
    "this galaxy and ngc 4395 together pose an interesting challenge to models for the obscuring torus : _ the type 1/type 2 dichotomy apparently extends down to the very lowest luminosities seen among nearby seyfert galaxies _ , below @xmath195 ergs s@xmath2 . while this is already well established for massive host galaxies @xcite , the discovery of a near - perfect type 2 analog to ngc 4395 raises the possibility that the obscuring torus might still be present even at these very low masses and luminosities .",
    "the detection of continuum polarization in 1109 + 6123 gives an intriguing hint of an obscured nucleus , and further searches for the presence of an obscuring torus and obscured blr in 1109 + 6123 , including deeper spectropolarimetry , x - ray observations , and mid - infrared spectroscopy , may provide critical new tests for wind - driven torus models .",
    "alternatively , 1109 + 6123 might be a `` true '' seyfert 2 that intrinsically lacks a blr .",
    "in this situation , the question remains : why would a blr occur in ngc 4395 , but not in 1109 + 6123 , which has a similar [ ] luminosity , and presumably a similar black hole mass as well ?",
    "if 1109 + 6123 is a true unobscured seyfert 2 , this would imply that the formation or lack of a blr must depend on some other properties of the agn in addition to @xmath173  or @xmath173/@xmath174 .",
    "obscuration by larger - scale dust lanes within the host galaxies is likely to play some role as well in determining the relative numbers of type 1 and type 2 agns in low - mass disk galaxies .",
    "the sdss images show that three objects in our sample are nearly edge - on disk galaxies , in which host galaxy - scale obscuration could easily explain the lack of broad emission lines in the optical spectrum .",
    "in contrast , in the gh04 seyfert 1 sample , none of the spiral host galaxies are close to edge - on @xcite . this is consistent with trends seen in the general seyfert population ; seyfert 1 nuclei are deficient in edge - on host galaxies relative to face - on hosts @xcite .",
    "similarly , in deep x - ray surveys , the difference between `` optically dull '' x - ray sources and broad - lined agns can be attributed at least in part to host galaxy - scale obscuration related to host inclination @xcite . a search for nuclear dust lanes in high - resolution images would provide some constraints on the impact of host - galaxy scale obscuring material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we describe a sample of low - mass seyfert 2 galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey , having a median absolute magnitude of @xmath0 mag . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies are type 2 counterparts to the seyfert 1 galaxies with intermediate - mass black holes identified by greene & ho ( 2004 ) . </S>",
    "<S> spectra obtained with the _ echellette spectrograph and imager _ at the keck observatory are used to determine the central stellar velocity dispersions and to examine the emission - line properties . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the stellar velocity dispersions are low ( @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) , and we find 12 objects having @xmath3 km s@xmath2 , a range where very few seyfert 2 galaxies were previously known . </S>",
    "<S> the sample follows the correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and fwhm ( [ ] ) seen in more massive seyfert galaxies , indicating that the narrow - line fwhm values are largely determined by virial motion of gas in the central regions of the host galaxies , but the [ ] emission lines exhibit a higher incidence of redward asymmetries and double - peaked profiles than what is found in typical seyfert samples . using estimates of the black hole masses and agn bolometric luminosities , we find that these galaxies are typically radiating at a high fraction of their eddington rate , with a median @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we identify one galaxy , sdss j110912.40 + 612346.7 , as a type 2 analog of the nearby dwarf seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4395 , with a nearly identical narrow - line spectrum and a dwarf spiral host of only @xmath5 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the close similarities between these two objects suggest that the obscuring torus of agn unification models may persist even at the lowest luminosities seen among seyfert galaxies , below @xmath6 ergs s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> spectropolarimetry observations of four objects do not reveal any evidence for polarized broad - line emission , but sdss j110912.40 + 612346.7 has a continuum polarization significantly in excess of the expected galactic foreground polarization , possibly indicative of scattered light from a hidden nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> forthcoming observations of this sample , including x - ray and mid - infrared spectroscopy , can provide new tests of the obscuring torus model for active galaxies at low luminosities . </S>"
