    "in modern society energy has become one among the main fuels for social and economic development . nowadays , the amount of energy used is massive , and it is destined to rise as population and wealth increase . needless to say , energy - related activities have significant environmental impacts .",
    "the main and most addressed issue is the emission of greenhouse - gas that follows the production of energy through fossil fuels as coal , oil and natural gas , and which results in serious damage to climate , biodiversity and human health  @xcite . to avoid the business - as - usual dependence on fossil fuels , a map of future energy mix that incorporates alternative sources is needed .",
    "several low - carbon resources should be part of this sustainable energy portfolio , and among them nuclear energy seems to be one of the few options available at scale to reduce carbon - dioxide emissions while providing a baseload generation  @xcite .    in this scenario ,",
    "the development of improved reactor technologies that will lead to an intrinsically safe nuclear energy production is regarded as a necessary step to ensure a long term sustainable energy supply  @xcite . towards this direction , the generation iv international forum ( gif )  @xcite works since 2001 to identify and select six nuclear energy systems that will be commercially available by 2030 - 2040 .",
    "in addition , the concept of a nuclear subcritical device called accelerator driven system ( ads ) is being developed both for energy production and radioactive waste disposal  @xcite .",
    "the r&d of these new reactor concepts require a level of accuracy and precision that challenges the present knowledge of nuclear data .",
    "the prediction of the behaviour of the reactor cores strongly depends on neutron - induced reaction cross - section data . in this context , the measurement of the @xmath0u radiative capture cross section is of high priority and is part of the nea high priority request list  @xcite , a compilation of the most relevant nuclear data requirements maintained by the nuclear energy agency of the organisation for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath0u constitutes more than 90% of nuclear fuel in power reactors , being one of the most important isotopes for neutron transport calculations in the active zone .",
    "in particular , for ordinary thermal nuclear reactors the uncertainties on fundamental design parameters such as the multiplication factor , the power peak , and the reactivity coefficient significantly depend on the @xmath0u(n,@xmath1 ) reaction cross - section for incident neutron energies from 0.0253 ev to 25 kev .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0u capture cross section uncertainty affects the uncertainty of the pu isotope density at the end of the fuel cycle ( 1.1% for @xmath3pu , 0.2% for @xmath4pu and 0.1% for @xmath5pu  @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of the radiative capture reaction on @xmath0u initiated many measurements of this cross section , mainly at the oak ridge electron linear accelerator ( orela )  @xcite and at the geel linear accelerator ( gelina )  @xcite facilities .",
    "in particular , an evaluation has been made by derrien _",
    "et al . _ in 2005 including the most significative previous capture and transmission measurements  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the fast region of the neutron spectrum , which is fundamental for fast neutron reactor calculations , inconsistencies between published experimental data can reach 15% , and the most recent evaluations disagree with each other by more than the uncertainties of the standards evaluation by carlson _",
    "in addition , a recent project has started , the collaborative international evaluated library organization ( cielo )  @xcite , which aims at producing an evaluated library common to europe , north america and asia .",
    "the focus of this project will initially be on a small number of the highest - priority isotopes , including @xmath0u due to its key relevance within the nuclear industry .    to solve the present inconsistencies and to lower the uncertainty in the cross section down to 1 - 3% in the energy range from 20 ev to 25 kev , complementary experiments , one at the ec - jrc laboratory gelina and two at the cern n_tof facility ,",
    "were scheduled within task 1.2 of the fp7 project andes of the european commission  @xcite .",
    "the proposed objective was to combine results from different detection systems and independent experimental principles , obtained from measurements performed independently in different facilities , so as to minimize the overall systematic uncertainty .",
    "this work presents the determination of high - accuracy radiative capture cross - section of @xmath0u , starting from the measurement performed at the n_tof facility with an array of two c@xmath2d@xmath2 liquid scintillators , which has been optimized with respect to the background induced by sample - scattered neutrons , and takes advantage of the total energy detection technique . this experimental setup , together with the extremely high instantaneous neutron flux of the n_tof facility , opens the possibility of measuring the @xmath0u capture cross - section also for neutron energies above 100 kev , an energy range of extreme interest for new nuclear technologies . in this work the @xmath0u(n,@xmath1 ) cross section",
    "has been analyzed from 1 ev up to 700 kev .",
    "the measurement was performed at the neutron time - of - flight ( tof ) facility of cern , n_tof , which became operative in 2001 and has since been at the cutting edge of neutron cross section measurements .",
    "the pulsed neutron beam at n_tof is produced by spallation of 20 gev / c protons from the cern proton synchrotron accelerator on a water - cooled pb target .",
    "a complete description of the n_tof facility can be found in refs .  @xcite . since the spallation mechanism is a remarkably powerful source of neutrons ,",
    "the instantaneous intensity of the n_tof neutron source of @xmath6 neutrons / pulse , is one of the highest worldwide .",
    "the pulsed neutron source is used together with a moderation system , so that the n_tof neutron beam covers about eleven orders of magnitude in energy from thermal to gev . in 2012 ,",
    "when the @xmath0u(n,@xmath1 ) measurement was performed , borated water was used as moderator to minimize the production of 2.2-mev @xmath1 rays originating from neutron capture in water , which constitutes the main source of background in measurements of capture cross - sections in the kev neutron - energy region .",
    "the facility has been designed on the basis of monte carlo fluka  @xcite simulations , and in particular the neutron source has been fully characterized together with its related @xmath1 background .",
    "the measurement takes advantage of the first beam line operative at n_tof , which is about 200 m long and is designed to clean as much as possible the neutron beam from secondary particles profusely produced in spallation reactions . to this purpose ,",
    "a sweeping magnet is placed at 145 m from the spallation target to deflect the remaining charged particles in the beam , and the beam tube is embedded in massive iron and concrete shielding to stop particles around the beam pipe .",
    "two collimators 72 and 175 m downstream of the spallation target are used for shaping the neutron beam . for capture measurements the inner diameter of the second collimator",
    "is reduced to 1.8 cm to allow for a close geometry between sample and detectors .",
    "the first experimental area ( ear1 ) , where the samples and detection systems are placed , is a 7.9 m long room starting at 182.3 m downstream of the spallation target .",
    "the neutron beam of the n_tof facility is constantly monitored by two independent low - background devices , without significantly affecting the neutron beam : the silicon monitor ( simon )  @xcite , with 4 silicon detectors looking at a 300 @xmath7 m thick @xmath8li foil in the beam , and two micromegas detectors  @xcite , with @xmath9u and @xmath10b as neutron converter .",
    "the neutron flux of the n_tof facility for the 2009 , 2010 and 2011 campaigns has been evaluated combining five independent measurements performed with different detectors , so as to cover the entire energy range with the highest precision reachable .",
    "a detailed description of the method can be found in ref .",
    "the flux related to this measurement , performed in 2012 , was not included in the evaluation procedure , but it has been monitored at the experimental area with simon , showing that the shape of the flux has remained constant within 2% ( i.e within uncertainties ) between 0.1 ev and 150 kev . in addition , the proton current , used to normalize the total neutron output , has been monitored with the pick - up detection system of the cern proton synchrotron .

    "the comparison has been also made using a higher threshold ( @xmath15 mev ) in the analysis of data from this work , the results being in agreement within the uncertainty with the ones obtained with the selected threshold of 250 kev .",
    "the @xmath0u(n,@xmath1 ) reaction cross - section has been measured at the n_tof facility of cern using an array of two deuterated - benzene scintillators .",
    "the purpose was to provide highly precise results to solve the inconsistencies among data in literature and in evaluated libraries .",
    "this cross section is in fact of extreme importance for the calculations of fast and thermal reactor parameters , and in particular the safety of nuclear reactors mainly depends on its uncertainty .",
    "thanks to the low background of the experimental setup , and to the high intensity of the n_tof neutron flux , the cross section could be measured from 1 ev to 700 kev . the measurement has been prepared and the data analyzed with extreme accuracy and precision , in order to provide results with an uncertainty as low as possible . in particular , great efforts have been made in order to evaluate and estimate all sources of background that affected the measurement .",
    "as expected , resonance parameters from this work show very good agreement with data in the jeff-3.2 and endf / b - vii.1 evaluated libraries .",
    "nevertheless , for a few weak resonances significantly higher kernels were found compared to evaluated data .    for neutron energies higher than 3 kev , the cross section has been extracted from the measured yield using average parameters to determine the correction factor for self - shielding and multiple interaction . in this unresolved resonance region ,",
    "the @xmath1 background strongly affects the measurement and , since it is not possible to directly measure its contribution , it has been precisely determined by means of monte carlo simulations .    for energies up to 20 kev results from this work",
    "are in fair agreement with the recent results obtained in gelina from kim _ et al . _ and with the cross section recommended by carlson _",
    "et al . _ , and",
    "up to 630 kev with the recent data by ullmann _",
    "et al._. from 20 to 80 kev the cross section from this work tends to stay slightly below the evaluated data , while for higher neutron energies from 80 to 700 kev the trend is opposite , and this work yields a cross section 15 to 25% higher than the endf / b - vii.1 evaluation , and 21 to 32% higher than the jeff-3.2 evaluation .    a comparison with the spectrum - averaged cross - section obtained by wallner _",
    "et al . _ shows good agreement for the result with the energy distribution centered at @xmath16 kev , while data from this work yield a 16% higher value for the energy distribution peaked at @xmath17 kev .",
    "this work has been fully supported by the the european commission within the fp7 project andes ( fp7 - 249671 ) .",
