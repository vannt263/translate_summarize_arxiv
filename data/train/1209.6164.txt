    "reactions between heavy nuclei at low energy above the barrier are dominated by binary inelastic collisions @xcite .",
    "even the most central collisions ( @xmath3 partial waves ) lead to highly - damped two - body exit channels , and no more fusion is observed .",
    "the attractive pocket in the internuclear potential disappears , as , for large enough values of the charge product of projectile and target,(@xmath4@xmath5 ) , the bombarding energy necessary to overcome the coulomb barrier is such that the repulsive potential is always stronger than the attractive nuclear one . according to the prediction of the classical potential model of bass , applied to the fusion of heavy nuclei ,",
    "the limiting value for fusion is given roughly by the product @xmath4@xmath5 = 2700 - 2800 @xcite .",
    "however , the study of central collisions of heavy nuclei in the intermediate energy regime ( @xmath0 = 20 - 100 @xmath1 ) has shown the existence of compact nuclear sources for which multifragmentation is increasingly the dominant decay channel .",

    "the transition between the two extreme pictures should clarify the mechanism responsible for the formation of such a source .",
    "is it fusion or massive transfer between the two heavy fragments ? does the attractive nuclear potential overcome the repulsive one ?",

    "what is the size of the heaviest fragment which can survive fission ?    in this contribution , we will provide an answer to some of these questions , by reporting on measurements performed with the indra multidetector of quasi - symmetric heavy system @xmath15+@xmath16 having @xmath17@xmath18 at the limit ( 2700 ) at the bombarding energy @xmath0 = 8 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 20 , 25 , 27 and 29 @xmath1 ; and @xmath15+@xmath19 with @xmath17@xmath18 = 4266 at @xmath0 = 15 @xmath1 .",

    "the charge state of the primary beam was 40 + , after the degrader the xe beam , as expected , had a wide distribution of charge states .",
    "we therefore used the alpha - spectrometer of ganil in order to select only one charge state .",
    "the b@xmath20 setting of the spectrometer was optimized for each incident energy .",
    "however for the two lowest energies , @xmath0 = 8 and 12 @xmath1 , more than one charge state were transmitted given uncertainties on these two incident energies .",
    "this uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath21@xmath0 = 0.5 ( 0.2 ) mev for the @xmath0 = 8 ( 12 ) mev beam respectively .",

    "four exit - channel have been identified consisting of 1- , 2- , 3- and 4-fragment .",
    "the relative yield of these exit - channels indicates that fission is the dominant decay mode at the lowest energy .",
    "the fission yield decreases progressively at the highest energy while the 3- and 4-fragment exit - channel increase .",
    "similar probabilities are reached at @xmath0 = 18 - 20 mev for 2-fragment and 3-fragment productions . at this energy",
    "the attractive nuclear potential seems to overcome the repulsive one .",
    "the size of the composite system has been estimated from the sum of the fragment charges .",
    "it can reach 90% of the total system , in contrast with the size of the surviving residues which reaches only 77% .    by using correlation functions",
    "we have estimated the total secondary emission of the lcp by the fragments for the @xmath15+@xmath16 at @xmath0 = 15 mev .",
    "this secondary emission remains almost constant with the number of fragments in the exit - channel , while the primary emission ( prior to the breakup of compound system ) decreases .",
    "this feature indicates that the process to breakup the compound system into 4-fragment starts before the breakup into 3 and into 2 fragments , respectively .",
    "we thank the staff of the ganil accelerator facility for their support during the experiment .",
