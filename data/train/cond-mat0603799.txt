    "according to the opinion expressed by the most part of the scientific community , the present - day situation of the superconductivity theory can hardly be called satisfactory . indeed ,",
    "while the bcs theory @xcite provides a qualitative explanation of phenomena observed in superconductors , it is unable to produce reliable predictions of their quantitative parameters . at the same time , it is implicitly suggested that the bcs theory contains no contradictions in its description of the conventional superconductivity ; problems are only believed to appear in connection with the description of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "that is why recent studies mostly concern high - temperature superconductors alone @xcite .",
    "all these studies include the bcs theory considered as an extreme case ; they only differ in mechanisms producing the attraction between electrons .",
    "therefore , these models do not essentially change the microscopic picture of the phenomenon .    according to the concept of the so called bcs - bec crossover @xcite ,",
    "the phase transition in the bcs theory shares many features with the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) phenomenon , which , eventually , allowed connecting it with the ginzburg - landau theory @xcite .",
    "currently , attempts are being made at providing a more precise description of superconductors within the framework of this concept .",
    "these models also incorporate the bcs model for an extreme case .",
    "it should be noted that , in 1980 - 90s , superconductivity theories unrelated to the bcs theory have been put forward .",
    "most of these models contradict experimental data even at the level of the qualitative description . by the present date",
    ", the interest towards such models has seen a substantial decrease .",
    "the superconductor model to be described in the present paper does not contain the bcs model as an extreme case either , and has nothing in common with the bec phenomenon .",
    "nevertheless , the model under development can already claim , at least , a semi - quantitative agreement with the experiment .",
    "its present - day status is described in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "this approach has been discussed in detail in a number of publications @xcite ; therefore , here we restrict ourselves to a shortest possible description , only indicating its initial differences with currently universally acknowledged concepts .",
    "the goal of the present study is a calculation of the superconducting gap in the framework of the proposed model in order to compare it with the analogous calculation results of the bcs theory .",
    "the study is performed on simple metals belonging to pt .",
    "fitting parameters obtained out of the quantitative calculation have the order of magnitude corresponding to that predicted by the theory .",
    "this agreement makes the approach under consideration look more attractive than the bcs theory .",
    "a procedure of renormalization for a system comprised of electrons and phonons correctly taking into account the singular nature of matrix elements of electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) in the long - wave limit has been performed previously @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a monatomic metal electron system , as obtained from the renormalization , has the following form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7,\\ ] ] @xmath8 and @xmath9 are creation and annihilation operators , respectively , of conductivity band electrons ; @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath11 electron spin indexes ; @xmath12 is the number of conductivity electrons per atom ; @xmath13 is the electron mass ; @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the ion mass ; @xmath16 is a parameter related to the observed sonic speed of the longitudinal polarization @xmath17 as @xmath18 ; @xmath19 is fermi vector ; @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the crystal dimension , and @xmath0 is the statical long - wave limit of the metal dielectric function caused by interband transitions .",
    "the above expression for the initial potential of eei substantially differs from other known results , first of all because @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "evidently , this result can not be obtained within the framework of frhlich model @xcite as this model lacks a consistent accounting for screening effects when calculating the epi hamiltonian terms .",
    "this circumstance has long been known @xcite ; now it is worthwhile to note here that it is the frhlich model that makes a basis for eliashberg equations , which the majority of authors @xcite consider to represent the most integral superconductor description in bcs theory .",
    "the expression ( 4 ) obtained for the initial eei excludes the formation of bound two - electron states in the system at this stage of problem examination .",
    "indeed , the coulomb term is significantly larger than @xmath24 , since @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "as a formation of bound two - electron states of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) appears to be impossible , any bosonization of the system is completely out of question .",
    "that is why the models involving bec to clarify the superconductivity phenomenon @xcite seem to be insufficiently substantiated .",
    "let us assume by definition that the hamiltonian @xmath27,defined as : @xmath28 has the same two - electron excitation spectrum as the initial hamiltonian ( 1 ) accounting for multi - particle effects .",
    "thus , in fact , we rigorously define the notion of the eei effective potential @xmath29 involved in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "we start the procedure of definition of @xmath30 by considering the following transformation : @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 are expressed in terms of wave functions ( wfs ) ) of stationary two - particle states @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the following way : @xmath37 it is easy to demonstrate that the transformation ( 7 ) reduces the hamiltonian @xmath27 to the diagonal form in the two - particle state space : @xmath38 taking into account multi - particle effects in electron gas is performed in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) as follows .",
    "consider the inverse transformation of ( 7 ) : @xmath39 then express the initial hamiltonian ( 1 ) in terms of operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 using the transformations ( 11 ) . in this form , the hamiltonian",
    "comprises terms of the structure @xmath42 , which , in the rpa , can be reduced to the form of @xmath43 .",
    "these terms define additional potentials @xmath44 , which can be included in the equation for effective potentials @xmath45 : @xmath46 eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 12 ) form a self - consistent system for @xmath47 definition .",
    "_ it is important to note that , in the framework of the proposed approach , it is the hamiltonian ( 10 ) which is related to the initial hamiltonian ( 1 ) by the unitary transformation ( 7 ) , and the introduction of the hamiltonian ( 6 ) into the theory is of an auxiliary nature and is used to calculate the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 . _    we should specify more explicitly in which sense we name the transformation ( 7 ) unitary , since the anti - commutators @xmath50 _ + $ ] and @xmath51_+$ ] differ from standard fermion commutation relations in the presence of terms @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is , however , easy to demonstrate that , in two - electron state space , a transition from @xmath54 states to @xmath55 does not alter the wfs scalar products ; therefore , the transformation ( 7 ) for this case should be considered to be unitary .",
    "then , the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( 6,7,11 ) can be considered as two first terms of the series with the number of terms equal to the number of particles in the system .",
    "these series are composed while determining the multi - particle excitation spectrum using the same procedure as invoked above for the calculation of a two - electron excitation spectrum .",
    "of course , the transformation ( 7 ) completed with the terms of the corresponding series is unitary for all states , in which the number of particles is less than or equal to the number of particles in the system .    using the rpa for the examination of an excitation spectrum allows for an introduction the hartree - fock method for calculating of one - electron energies into the above calculation routine . from this point of view",
    ", the proposed approach is essentially a generalization of the hartree - fock approximation for a multi - particle spectrum calculation .",
    "previously @xcite , the above mentioned self - consistent system for the potential ( 4 ) have been formulated and solved using the perturbation theory for solution of eigenvalue problems ( 9 ) .",
    "it should also be noted that considering the coulomb eei alone ( see appendix a ) within the framework of the proposed scheme is well consistent with the modern idea of the effective eei in a degenerate plasma .",
    "this fact confirms the consistency of the proposed approach for treatment of multi - particle problems with interaction .    combining ( a5 ) with previously obtained results @xcite yields the following equation : @xmath56 where @xmath57 . in this form ,",
    "the equation for @xmath30 is valid in two limits : @xmath26 and @xmath23 .",
    "it ensues from eq .",
    "( 13 ) that an attraction between electrons is present in the long - wave limit .",
    "now according to eliashberg equations , cooper pair formation is mainly due to short - wave phonons with a wave vector @xmath58 .",
    "evidently , the authors of the theory were guided by the erroneous hypothesis of absence of electrons attraction in the long - wave limit , which had been suggested based on the plasma model analysis performed back in 1950 s @xcite .",
    "( 9 ) do not allow the appearance of bound states , then @xmath59 , and the theory describes a normal metal .",
    "appearance of bound states with the binding energy @xmath60 allows to simplify the hamiltonian ( 10 ) . neglecting energy corrections @xmath61 for unbound states of electron pairs",
    ", the hamiltonian ( 10 ) for a superconductor can be written as @xcite : @xmath62    it is easily seen that the ground state @xmath63 of the hamiltonian ( 14 ) coincides with the well - known expression for a non - interacting fermi gas : @xmath64 therefore , from the point of view of the new theory , there is no ground for suggesting a possibility of formation of bec , although the theory does discuss wave functions of bound states of electron pairs .",
    "hence , the ginsburg - landau theory @xcite also lacks microscopic grounds .",
    "nevertheless , we take it as evident that main predictions of the ginsburg - landau theory are reproduced within the framework of the proposed theory ; therefore , the absence of bec in the system in question is not to be worried about .    along with the ground state @xmath65 , also the one - electron and one - hole excitations",
    "are the stationary states of hamiltonian ( 14 ) .",
    "this allows to calculate the arising energy gap value @xmath66 in the one - electron spectrum of the ground state .",
    "if there exists only one bound solution with a zero spin and a fixed pair momentum , the value of @xmath67 is calculated as : @xmath68",
    "the expression ( 13 ) is evidently inapplicable for calculation of superconductive properties of metals due to the presence of singularities at @xmath69 and @xmath70 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have not up to now taken into account the hamiltonian terms usually related to scattering processes , which can result in an uncertainty of electron momentum and , consequently , in a removal of singularities even in the initial eei potential @xmath71 .",
    "let us begin with the simplest case of a metal that has been made on the basis of a semiconductor material by implanting electro - active defects into it .",
    "evidently , in this case , the abovementioned momentum uncertainty is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the free path of electrons as determined by the scattering on lattice defects .    in the case of pure pt metals ,",
    "the following considerations should be taken into account .",
    "the renormalization procedure for metals @xcite used only longitudinal phonons with a distinctly expressed singularity of the epi potential in the long - wave limit . however , due to various reasons , the epi terms remaining in the hamiltonian after this renormalization have a weak non - analyticity in the said limit for acoustic phonons . neglecting relativistic effects these terms",
    "have the following form : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the phonon frequency ; @xmath74 and @xmath75 are phonon creation and annihilation operators , respectively , including the case of transversal polarization , @xmath13 and @xmath76 are the phonon mode index and phonon quasi - momentum , respectively , and @xmath77 is the reciprocal lattice vector . as to @xmath78 , it is a piecewise regular function with respect to variations of the arguments @xmath79 and @xmath76 .",
    "taking into account the term @xmath80 radically alters the wfs of stationary one - electron states due to the possibility of spontaneous creation of phonons from electrons , since fermi speed is much greater than the sonic speed .",
    "therefore , from the point of view of calculation of the effective eei , the phonon system acts as a reservoir that electrons can exchange momentum with , which can be accounted for by a regularization of eei potential expressions .",
    "let us try to determine the arising momentum uncertainty from the consideration of the temperature dependence of the specific resistance @xmath81 at temperatures @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is debye temperature . then , according to the fermi s golden rule , the following relation is valid for electron - phonon transition frequency @xmath84 of an electron of momentum @xmath79 : @xmath85 which takes into account that in this case , the transitions are induced by phonons with a distribution function approximately equal to @xmath86 .    of course , what we are interested in is the spontaneous transition frequency @xmath87 .",
    "it can be expressed as : @xmath88 comparison of eqs . ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) yields : @xmath89 where @xmath90 it is important to note that the following relationships are strictly fulfilled for @xmath91 : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the maximum frequency of the phonon spectrum .    on the other hand",
    ", the hamiltonian ( 17 ) is in certain cases the main cause of energy dissipation in electron tunneling between superconductors .",
    "that is why a correct numerical processing of the current - voltage characteristics ( cvc ) in the region where the tunnel junction ( tj ) behaves itself similarly to resistance yields a more precise evaluation of the parameter @xmath91 than the relationship ( 22 ) .",
    "the @xmath94 value can be roughly evaluated from drude formula for specific resistance @xmath81 at high temperatures : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is plasma frequency determined in optical studies of metals in the infrared ( ir ) range , @xmath97 is the derivative of the specific electric resistance over temperature , for which , evidently , @xmath98 . considering that the free path of a single electron in the system is calculated as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is an average electron velocity over the fermi surface , the definitive expression for the sought uncertainty @xmath101 of a stationary single - electron state is : @xmath102    in the further study , taking into account that for the metals considered in the present paper @xmath103",
    ", we use the following regularized expression of the eei effective potential ( cf .",
    "( 13 ) ) : @xmath104 this version of regularization allows to obtain an analytical expression for the eei potential in a coordinate representation , which simplifies the calculation procedure .",
    "equation ( 25 ) is suitable for calculating the superconductivity gap . from the technical point of view",
    ", the task can be reduced to determining the energy of bound states of pairs for a potential that is spherically symmetrical in the coordinate representation , whose fourier transform was defined in eq.(25 ) .    considering the validity of the relationship @xmath105 , it can easily be concluded that in the coordinate representation the first term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 25 ) , which describes a screened coulomb repulsion of electrons , has a form of a delta - shaped function as compared with the second term .",
    "therefore , its existence can be accounted for virtually without affecting the precision of the calculation by introducing the boundary condition of @xmath106 at @xmath107 into the appearing eigenvalue problem : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 is equal to the second term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 25 ) .    having solved eq .",
    "( 26 ) we evaluated the appearing superconductivity gap using eq .",
    "( 16 ) or its generalized form @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the number of the bound state if eq . (",
    "26 ) had multiple bound solutions , as in the case of pb , where two bound states are present , and the ratio of their binding energies is approximately equal to 0.04 .",
    "let us dwell on the problem of estimation of value @xmath113 , introduced in eq .",
    "( 24 ) . to estimate it",
    ", we use the method similar to that suggested by g. p. motulevich @xcite .",
    "namely , consider the parameter @xmath114 , which relates the plasma frequency value @xmath115 , as observed in ir - range measurement to the corresponding value @xmath116 calculated based on the metal valence : @xmath117 assume that the approximate equation @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the area of the fermi surface , is valid for the integral @xmath120 over the fermi surface , where @xmath121 is the electron velocity .",
    "then , according to drude formula : @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are fermi velocity and fermi surface area as calculated based on the metal valence , similarly to @xmath116 . on the other hand , considering the ratio of density of states at fermi level over its value calculated for an ideal electron gas of the same concentration , we obtain : @xmath125 where the parameter @xmath126 can be determined based on the metal electronic specific heat data at low temperatures . comparing eqs .",
    "( 29 - 30 ) yields : @xmath127 which provides a solution of the problem as stated .",
    "the only ill - defined parameter of the calculation is the value of @xmath91 , which is only limited by the relationships ( 22 ) .",
    "that is why the proposed version of the calculation used this value as fitting parameter .",
    "in other terms , the parameter @xmath91 used in the definition of @xmath128 was chosen such as to make the resulting width of the superconductivity gap coincide with its experimentally known values .    table  [ tab : metals ] lists both initial parameters ( @xmath129,@xmath130 , @xmath126 , @xmath0 , @xmath67 ) and the calculated values of the parameter @xmath91 for al , zn , pb , and sn .",
    "an analysis of the ratio @xmath131 , as provided in the same table indicates that fitting parameters @xmath91 have the same order of magnitude as the debye temperature @xmath83 in full accordance with eq.(21 ) . it should be noted here that the initial data of the calculations had a fairly wide variation range : @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 . in view of this fact",
    ", a physicist would normally consider accidental coincidences out of question , and acknowledge the proposed theory .",
    "this circumstance suggests that a discussion on the approximations introduced within the framework of the approach under development , involving experts in both theoretical physics and mathematics , would be quite useful",

    "in this situation , a study of beryllium , for which @xmath143 k , and the transition temperature @xmath144 k , would be of an incontestable interest .    in the framework of the bcs theory ,",
    "such deviations from its predictions are compensated by considering the value of the so - called coulomb pseudopotential @xmath145 , which is used as a fitting parameter @xcite .",

    ", the proposed theory appears to be more advantageous than the bcs theory .",
    "we may note as a conclusion that a calculation of the gap value for superconductors produced from semiconductors can be performed without determining the parameter @xmath91 at all .",
