    "optical excitation of graphene can result in the interband population inversion  @xcite . at sufficiently strong excitation",
    ", the interband emission of photons can prevail over the intraband ( drude ) absorption . in this case",
    ", the real part of the dynamic conductivity re  @xmath0 becomes negative .",
    "due to the gapless energy spectrum of graphene  @xcite , re  @xmath0 can be negative at relatively low frequencies @xmath1 , for instance , those in the terahertz ( thz ) range .",
    "this effect can be used in graphene - based thz optically pumped lasers with the fabri - perot resonators and the resonators based on dielectric or slot - line waveguides  @xcite . as was previously pointed out  @xcite and analyzed  @xcite , apart from the lasing associated with the stimulated generation of electromagnetic modes , the stimulated generation of different plasmons ( with their conversion into electromagnetic radiation ) can also be of practical interest .",
    "the plasma excitations in graphene were considered , in particular , in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the propagation and amplification of surface plasmons ( sps ) in graphene structures under nonequilibrium conditions when re  @xmath2 due to optical pumping .",
    "we consider a single - graphene layer ( sgl ) and a multiple - graphene layer ( mgl ) on a substrate .",
    "as demonstrated recently ( see the review paper  @xcite and the references therein ) , the mgls , which constitute stacks of disoriented ( non - bernal stacked ) gls , exhibit similar electron and optical properties as individual gls , while the electron momentum relaxation time in such mgls can be extremely long .",
    "the latter circumstance implies that the intraband absorption of photons and plasmons can be effectively diminished .",
    "this makes the mgls very prospective for different optoelectronic devices considering that the net dynamic conductivity along gls increases with increasing their number in the mgl structure .",
    "the mgl structures can be particularly effective in lasers in which the thz modes are supported by the external resonator or waveguide  @xcite , thz photodetectors  @xcite , and transit - time thz oscillators  @xcite .",
    "however , sgl and mgl structures can play the dual role : the imaginary parts of their dynamic conductivity provides the mode localization near the sgl or mgl ( i.e. , the formation of sps ) , while the real part provide absorption or amplification of plasmons . due to this ,",
    "the mgl structures as sp waveguides are not always superior over the sgl structures .",
    "+        since the thickness , @xmath3 , of the mgl structure with even relatively large number , @xmath4 , of gls is rather small in comparison with the wavelength of the plasmons under consideration , we shall consider the sgl and mgl structure alike .",
    "the real mgl usually include a highly conducting bottom gl ( at the interface between the substrate and other gls ) with rather high electron density  @xcite .",
    "although this bottom gl can be in some way removed , we will take it into account .",
    "it is assumed that the gl or mgl structure is illuminated from the top by light with the energy of photons @xmath5 . under optical excitation ,",
    "the electron and hole densities exceed substantially their equilibrium values . due to this",
    ", one can consider the electron and hole systems under consideration as characterized by the quasi - fermi energies @xmath6 , respectively , and the effective temperature @xmath7 .",
    "a distinction in the fermi energies in gls with different indices is due to the attenuation of incident optical radiation associated with its absorption in the gls closer to the structure top : @xmath8 .",
    "the electron - hole system in the bottom gl in mgls is characterized by the unified fermi energy @xmath9 determined by the doping of this gl .",
    "if the characteristic time , @xmath10 , of the emission of the optical phonon by an electron or a hole is much shorter than the time of pair collisions , the photoexcited electrons and holes emit a cascade of optical phonons and occupy low energy states in the conduction and valence bands , respectively . in this case , the contribution of optical excitation to the heating of the electron - hole system is small , so that the effective temperature @xmath7 is close to the lattice temperature @xmath11  @xcite . in the opposite case ,",
    "the photoexcited electrons and holes are thermalized , and their effective temperature is determined by the pumping photon energy @xmath5 and the rate of electron and hole energy relaxation .",
    "in such a situation , the effective temperature can be elevated , so that somewhat stronger optical pumping might be needed to fullfil the condition re  @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the net dynamic conductivity in the lateral direction of a structure with @xmath4 gls at the signal frequency @xmath1 can be presented as the sum of the contributions of the individual gls @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and the bottom gl @xmath14 ;    @xmath15    considering the expressions for @xmath12 and @xmath14 obtained previously ( see , for instance , refs ,  @xcite ) , one can arrive at the following :    @xmath16 +   \\displaystyle \\tanh\\biggl(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega - 2\\varepsilon_f^{(k)}}{4k_bt}\\biggr ) -   \\frac{4\\hbar\\omega}{i\\pi}\\int_0^{\\infty}\\frac{g(\\varepsilon , \\varepsilon_f^{k})- g(\\hbar\\omega/2 , \\varepsilon_f^{k } ) } { ( \\hbar\\omega)^2 - 4\\varepsilon^2}d\\varepsilon\\biggr\\ } , % \\ ] ]    @xmath17\\ ] ] @xmath18^{-1 } - \\biggl[1 + \\exp\\biggl(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega/2 + \\varepsilon_f^b}{k_bt}\\biggr)\\biggr]^{-1 } - \\frac{4\\hbar\\omega}{i\\pi}\\int_0^{\\infty}\\frac{g(\\varepsilon , \\varepsilon_f^b)- g(\\hbar\\omega/2 , \\varepsilon_f^b ) } { ( \\hbar\\omega)^2 -   4\\varepsilon^2}d\\varepsilon\\biggr\\}.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath19 is the electron charge , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the electron and hole momentum relaxation times in the bottom and other gls , respectively , @xmath22 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath24 in the case of sgl structure , one should put @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for the mgl structures without the bottom gl , one can use eq .",
    "( 3 ) formally setting @xmath26 .",
    "the quasi - fermi energies in the gls with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , are mainly determined by the electron ( hole ) density in this layer @xmath29 , with @xmath30 ( at sufficiently strong degeneracy of the electron and hole systems ) , i.e. , by the rate of photogeneration @xmath31 by the optical radiation at the @xmath32th gl plane .",

    "in particular , sgls exhibit substantially stronger ( about 50 times in the peaks ) amplification ( higher plasmon gain ) in a wide frequencies range ( from 4 to 8 thz ) at @xmath41  ps .",
    "this is attributed to markedly different values of the sp group velocities in sgls ( relatively small plasmon group velocity ) and in mgls ( in which this velocity is relatively high ) , as shown in fig .",

    "it was demonstrated that at sufficiently strong but realistic optical pumping , the sp absorption coefficient can be negative ( so that the gain is positive ) in the certain range of frequencies .",
    "the absolute value of the sp absorption coefficient ( plasmon gain ) in sgl structure can be fairly large and markedly exceed the gain of electromagnetic modes in the dielectric waveguides with optically pumped sgl or mgl structures .",
