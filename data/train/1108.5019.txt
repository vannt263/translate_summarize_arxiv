    "in this paper , we are concerned with the lagrangian controllability of the three dimensional euler equation for perfect incompressible fluids by means of a boundary control .",
    "the problem under view is the following .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smooth bounded domain of @xmath3 and let @xmath4 be a nonempty open part of its boundary @xmath5 .",
    "given @xmath6 , we consider the classical euler system for perfect incompressible fluids in @xmath2 : @xmath7 as boundary conditions , one usually considers the impermeability condition on @xmath5 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for the unit outward normal vector field on @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the problem under view , the impermeability condition is merely imposed on @xmath10 : @xmath11 consequently , since we do not prescribe boundary values for @xmath12 on @xmath13 , the problem stated as above is underdetermined .",
    "it is in fact an implicit control problem ; in other words , we consider the boundary values on @xmath4 as a control on this system , i.e. a way to influence the fluid in a prescribed way .",
    "if one wants to close the system , as shown by khazhikov @xcite , one may consider as boundary conditions on @xmath4 the following ones : @xmath14 that is , the normal part of the velocity field on @xmath4 and the tangential entering vorticity .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on this notion of boundary values . due to the complexity of this formulation of boundary values , and as in the literature concerning the controllability of the euler equation ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", we prefer not to refer to them explicitely and to look for the solution @xmath15 itself .",
    "once a solution of - is given , its suitable trace on @xmath13 can be thought as the control .",
    "the question that we raise is the possibility of prescribing the motion of a set of particles driven by a fluid governed by - .",
    "it is classical in fluid mechanics that one can describe the motion of a fluid from two different points of view .",
    "one possibility , referred as the eulerian description of the fluid , is to describe the velocity of fluid particles that pass `` through '' a given point .",
    "the other possibility , referred as the lagrangian description of the fluid consists in following fluid particles along the flow . to that purpose",
    "one has to solve the differential equation associated to the velocity field .",
    "the notion of controllability that we consider in this paper is different from the usual notion of controllability and , in some sense , closer to the lagrangian description of the fluid than the usual notion of controllability .",
    "the standard sense of controllability would refer to the possibility of driving the velocity field ( the state of the system ) , from one prescribed value to a fixed target .",
    "the study of the controllability of the euler equation has been initiated by j .-",
    "m . coron in @xcite and @xcite , and then studied by the first author in @xcite and @xcite . also related to the boundary control of the velocity field , the question of asymptotic stabilization of this system around zero was studied by j .-",
    "m . coron in @xmath16-d simply connected domains ( see @xcite ) and by the first author for what concerns more general @xmath16-d domains ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , we consider the problem of prescribing the displacement of a set of particles , rather than the velocity field in final time . in @xcite , the authors showed that in @xmath16-d , one can indeed prescribe approximately the motion of some specific sets of fluids .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to consider the case of the dimension @xmath0 .      in this section",
    ", we fix the notations and give the basic definitions .    in the sequel ,",

    "we now recall some definitions from differential geometry ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a jordan surface @xmath30 in @xmath1 is the image of @xmath31 by some homeomorphism @xmath32 . according to the jordan - brouwer theorem ( see @xcite or @xcite )",
    ", @xmath33 has two connected components , one of which is bounded and will be denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "moreover when the homeomorphism @xmath32 is a diffeomorphism , we have a unit outward normal vector field on @xmath30 , which we will denote by @xmath35 .    two jordan surfaces @xmath36 and @xmath37 embedded in @xmath38 are said to be isotopic in @xmath2 , if there exists a continuous map @xmath39\\times { \\mathbb{s}}^2\\to \\omega$ ] such that @xmath40 , @xmath41 and for each @xmath42,\\,\\mathfrak{i}(t,\\cdot)$ ] is an homeomorphism of @xmath31 into its image .",
    "when , for some @xmath43 , this homeomorphism is a @xmath44-diffeomorphism with respect the space variable , @xmath45 will be said to be a @xmath46-isotopy , or , when @xmath47 , a smooth isotopy .",
    "a one - parameter continuous family of diffeomorphisms of @xmath2 is called a diffeotopy of @xmath2 .    when their regularity is not specified , the geometrical objects are considered to be smooth in the sequel .",

    "[ rem.1 ] it is easy to see that the conditions that @xmath36 and @xmath37 should be isotopic and enclose the same volume are necessary in order that a smooth volume - preserving flow drives @xmath55 to @xmath56 . in particular @xmath60 comes from the incompressibility of the fluid",
