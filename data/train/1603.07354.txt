    "two particle correlations in high - energy collisions have played significant role to unravel qcd novel phenomena @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of the so - called ridge phenomenon , namely di - hadron collimation in the relative azimuthal angle @xmath0 between pairs at near - side @xmath1 ( and at away - side @xmath2 ) which extend to a large pseudorapidity separation between pairs @xmath3 , in high - multiplicity events selection in both proton - proton and proton(deuteron)-nucleus collisions at the lhc and rhic @xcite and more recently in @xmath4 collisions at rhic @xcite , triggered an on - going debate about the underlying dynamics of high - multiplicity events in small colliding systems .",
    "strikingly , such correlations when triggering on rare events with high multiplicities ( not present in minimum bias proton - proton collisions ) show great deal of similarity to that measured in semi peripheral nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "the observation of a ridge in high - multiplicity p+pb collisions @xcite was less surprising compared to the same effect in proton - proton ( p+p ) collisions @xcite , but it was unexpected that the strength of the correlation is almost as large as the ridge in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the ridge - type structure in nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions at rhic and the lhc is fairly understood as a phenomenon related to hydrodynamical behavior of the quark - gluon - plasma , see for example refs.@xcite .",
    "however , it is still an outstanding problem to understand how ( and why ) a small system like the one produced in p+p collisions , an order of magnitude smaller than in heavy - ion collisions , exhibits a hydro type behavior @xcite .",
    "the initial - state color - glass - condensate ( cgc ) effective field theory approach provides an alternative description of the ridge effect in small colliding systems @xcite . within the initial - state cgc framework",
    ", it was shown that the ridge effect can arise from three rather different mechanisms : glasma graphs @xcite , local anisotropy of target fields @xcite and spatial variation of partonic density @xcite . in principle",
    ", all these three mechanisms can be relevant to understanding the true physical origin of the ridge in p+p(a ) collisions @xcite .",
    "note that it was recently shown that the calculation based on the glasma graphs @xcite can be understood in terms of bose enhancement of gluons in the hadronic wave - functions @xcite .",
    "a complete analysis of the observed ridge effect in p+p(a ) collisions which incorporates all above - mentioned contributions is still missing . for recent reviews on the ridge effect ,",
    "see refs.@xcite .",
    "it is currently unknown whether the ridge is a universal phenomenon , for all different two - particle productions such as di - hadron , photon - jet , di - jet and di - photon production in p+p(a ) collisions , see ref.@xcite . in this paper , for the first time , we investigate whether based on the initial - state physics there is a ridge - type structure for prompt photon and jet pair production in high multiplicity p+p(a ) collisions at rhic and the lhc .",
    "we show near - side collimation of photon - jet production in p+p(a ) collisions strongly depends on the gluon saturation dynamics and such measurements can help to understand the true origin of ridge effect in high - multiplicity events .",
    "photons radiated in hard collisions not via hadronic decays are usually called prompt photon",
    ". there are advantages to studying prompt photon and jet pair production as compared to di - hadron ( and di - jet ) production .",
    "it is theoretically cleaner ; one avoids the difficulties involved with description of hadronization and possible initial - state - final - state interference effects which may be present for hadrons pair production .",
    "in particular , in the inclusive di - jet production at leading - order approximation , higher number of wilson lines , the weizscker - williams and the dipole gluon distributions are involved @xcite while in diffractive dis di - jet @xcite , photon - jet @xcite and prompt di - photon @xcite cross - sections , only dipole gluon distribution appears which is both experimentally and theoretically well - known , see for example refs.@xcite .",
    "moreover , in contrast to gluons , prompt photons do not scatter on the target gluon field , but rather decohere from the projectile wavefunction due to scatterings of the quarks .",
    "therefore , the underlying mechanism of prompt photon and quark pair production is quite different from two gluons ( and quark - gluon ) pair production , and such measurements can provide vital complementary information to address whether it is the initial or final state effects that play dominant role in formation of the ridge collimation in p+p(a ) collisions . note that the photon - hadron ( and photon - jet ) correlations have also been a very powerful probe of the in - medium parton energy loss in high - energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that the correlation of the back - to - back photon - hadron pair production in high - energy p+p and p+a collisions can be used to probe the gluon saturation at small - x region and to study the physics of cold nuclear matter in dense region . however , in the previous studies , photon - hadron correlations were only studied in a small kinematic window ( concentrating mostly in away - side correlations at @xmath5 ) in minimum bias ( or medium impact parameters ) collisions . here ,",
    "we extend the previous cgc studies , and analysis in details photon - jet and photon - hadron pair correlations in p+p and p+a collisions at finite rapidity separations between prompt photon and jet @xmath6 for arbitrary azimuthal angle @xmath7 between the pairs in high multiplicity events .",
    "we show that due to gluon saturation dynamics the photon - jet pairs within forward rapidity separation about @xmath8 are collimated in the relative azimuthal angle between pairs at near - side @xmath9 at low transverse momenta of pairs in high multiplicity collisions .",
    "these ridge - like features are strikingly similar to the observed ridge effect for di - hadron correlations @xcite at rhic and the lhc .",
    "we provide various predictions for photon - jet correlations ( and the ridge ) which can be tested at rhic and the lhc .",
    "the asymmetric nature of photon - hadron ( and photon - jet ) production , and the fact that in semi - inclusive photon - hadron production , qcd and electromagnetic interactions are inextricably intertwined , make correlations very intriguing .",
    "we show that the hadronization of jet has non - trivial effects on the photon - jet correlations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows ; in sec .",
    "ii , we first provide a concise description of theoretical framework by introducing the main formulas for the calculation of the cross sections of photon - jet and photon - hadron pair production within the cgc approach . in sec .",

    "it is generally believed that a system of gluons at high energy or small bjorken - x forms a new state of matter where the gluon distribution saturates @xcite . such a system is endowed with a new dynamical momentum scale , the so - called saturation scale at which non - linear gluons recombination effects become as important as the gluon radiation .",
    "the saturation scale controls the general features of bulk of particles produced in small - x region .",
    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) approach has been proposed to study the physics of gluon saturation at small - x region @xcite .",
    "the cgc formalism is an effective perturbative qcd theory in which one systematically re - sums quantum corrections which are enhanced by large logarithms of 1/x and also incorporates density effects .",

    "the cross - section for production of a quark and prompt photon in dilute - dense scatterings such as proton - nucleus collisions was obtained within a hybrid approximation in the cgc framework by three independent groups of gelis - jalilian - marian @xcite , baier - mueller - schif @xcite and kovner - rezaeian @xcite . in the hybrid approximation @xcite ,",

    "we showed that the collimation of long - range in the relative rapidity @xmath147 of pairs of prompt photon and jet at the near - side @xmath9 , the ridge effect , strongly depends on the saturation dynamics and is directly related to the existence of a maximal occupancy ( a peak ) in the phase space distribution of gluons in the target wavefunction ( or gluon saturation ) .",
    "the photon - jet collimation at near - side is maximum at kinematics that the value of typical total transfer momentum to the target is similar to the value of the saturation scale in the system @xmath195 , see .",

    "we also studied the near - side photon - hadron correlations , and showed that the hadronization of the jet has non - trivial effects on the correlation .",
    "the photon - hadron correlations defined via eqs.([cp1],[az ] ) is not symmetric with respect to replacing the rapidities of the produced prompt photon and hadron ( @xmath199 ) when transverse momentum of photon and hadron is equal @xmath200 .",

    "we showed that this effect can be traced back to the rapidity dependence of average total transfer momentum @xmath190 satisfying the condition in , see .    the prompt photon and jet pair correlations at forward rapidities in the away - side region exhibit decorrelation at low transverse momenta , and double ( or single ) peak structure at high transverse momenta , see .",
    "the existence of a double - peak structure at away - side seems to be a universal feature of electromagnetic probes , and was also reported for photon - hadron @xcite , dilepton - hadron @xcite , and di - photon @xcite correlations in high - energy p+pb collisions .",
    "although di - hadron ridge was observed in p+p and p(d)+a collisions @xcite both at the lhc and rhic , the photon - jet and photon - hadron correlations have not yet been measured at the lhc and rhic .",
    "our study here shows that the energy , density and transverse momenta dependence of photon - jet ( and photon - hadron ) correlations both at near side and away side provide essential complementary information to understand the true underlying dynamics of ridge phenomenon in high - energy collisions .",
    "it was shown that the di - hadron ridge effect can be understood entirely within the framework of the initial - state cgc physics @xcite , see also refs .",
    ". there are also competing mechanisms based on the final state effects , like hydrodynamics approach @xcite , which provide excellent description of the same data .",
    "our study here may indicate that the ridge effect in high - multiplicity p+p(a ) collisions is universal for different two - particle production , see also @xcite .",
    "note that here we only considered prompt photon and quark pair production due to scatterings of a single quark ( antiquarks ) to the cgc target @xcite .",
    "the actual cross section of photon - jet production also contains contribution of jets ( quarks and gluons ) and prompt photons produced independently from different quarks and ( antiquarks ) .",
    "however , one may not expect any long - range correlated emissions from independent production .",
    "it will likely amount to an uncorrelated pedestal proportional to the product of single photon ( or single jet ) inclusive cross sections .",
    "nevertheless , this effect remains to be investigated in details in future .",
    "the main building part of photon - jet production in electron - nucleus collisions is similar to the ones in quark - nucleus collisions at small - x .",
    "therefore , our general outcome here can also be tested in a future electron - ion collider @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate long range rapidity correlations of pairs of prompt photon and jet in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions at rhic and the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we show that photon - jet correlations exhibit long - range azimuthal collimation at near - side for low transverse momenta of the produced photon and jet in high - multiplicity events . </S>",
    "<S> these ridge - like features are strikingly similar to the observed ridge effect for di - hadron correlations at rhic and the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we show that correlations in the relative rapidity and the relative azimuthal angle between pairs of prompt photon and jet strongly depend on the gluon saturation dynamics at small - x kinematics and such measurements can help to understand the true origin of the observed di - hadron ridge in p+a collisions , and address whether the ridge is a universal phenomenon for all two particle correlations at high energy and high multiplicity events . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate if there is a ridge - like structure for photon - hadron pair correlations at rhic and the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the hadronization of jet has non - trivial effects on the photon - jet correlations . </S>"
