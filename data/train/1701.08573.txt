    "mathematicians have been interested in parlor games since the time of plato .",
    "it was euler who started the new field of graph theory with a game theoretic notion- what would be the smallest path through the seven rivers of konigsberg @xcite .",
    "however , it was left to john von neumann to put parlor games in mathematical language under the guise of game theory@xcite .",
    "game theory when it started out was a remarkable concept which enabled economists , social scientists , statistical physicists to propose game theoretic solutions to economic , social and statistical physics problems @xcite .",
    "although , quantum theory was ante - natal to game theory , quantum physicists were late in employing game theoretic techniques in quantum problems .",
    "it was not until quantum information theory came into being that quantum game theoretic problems came in to vogue@xcite .",
    "however , a rude blow was struck on quantum game theory by the work of van enk and pike @xcite who purported to show that quantum games do not have anything extra to offer than classical games , albeit with the caveat that they might have a relevance to quantum algorithms .",
    "this work led to an embargo in certain journals@xcite regarding game theory papers .",
    "van enk and pike s argument is on the basis of the prisoner s dilemma both the classical and the quantum version@xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to provide an alternative to van enk - pike s case study on prisoner s dilemma .",
    "we show that the van enk - pike work is just an one - off and by no means universal , in fact we provide an alternative game- the quantum hawk - dove game which indeed gives a better solution than the classical equivalent .",
    "this paper is organized as follows- section ii reviews the concept of quantum games , where we briefly describe nash equilibrium and pareto optimality using prisoner s dilemma as an example .",
    "we elucidate the van enk - pike s criterion and the motivation behind this work in subsequent subsections .",
    "section iii introduces and solves the quantum hawk - dove game and we show that how a random strategy in a quantum hawk - dove game gives us both a better payoff as well as pareto optimality .",
    "this is followed in section iv with a brief discussion on our results and finally in the appendix we implement the random strategy on quantum prisoner s dilemma where it is shown that we do not get better payoffs then what is classically possible .",
    "according to eisert , et .",
    ", any situation @xcite wherein a quantum system steered by two or more parties , results in the quantification of utilities , can be formulated as a quantum game . in general",
    ", a game @xmath1 in the strategic form is a triplet@xcite- @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ game ] ) , @xmath3 defines a finite set of players , @xmath4 is the set of strategies of player @xmath5 , for every player @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the real space ) is a function associating each vector of strategies @xmath9 with the payoff @xmath10 of player @xmath5 , for every player @xmath6 .",
    "for a two player strategic game , it is convenient to write equation eq .",
    "( [ game ] ) in bimatrix form- + @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ asd ] ) , @xmath12 represents strategy profile with @xmath13 being the player s profile and @xmath14 the strategy for each player .",
    "a pair @xmath15 represents the payoffs for the player 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "a two player quantum game @xmath16 can be enumerated as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 describing the hilbert space of the physical system , @xmath19 the initial state and the sets @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the permissible quantum operations of the two players . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the utility functionals or payoff operators which specify the utility for each player and operations @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the strategies for each player .",
    "one of the most widely used methods for predicting the outcome of a strategic - form game is nash equilibrium @xcite .",
    "it is a strategy profile from which no player has a profitable deviation .",
    "a strategy vector @xmath26 is a nash equilibrium if for each player @xmath27 and each strategy @xmath28 the following is satisfied : @xmath29    nash equilibrium exists when each player s strategy is his / her best response to the predicted strategies of opponents .",
    "when such a equilibrium exists , no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from it . in other words ,",
    "two players are mutually better off when neither person can gain additional utility by unilaterally changing his / her strategy , this outcome is then a nash equilibrium .",
    "the idea of nash equilibrium is also intimately connected to the concept of pareto optimality .",
    "if two or more players follow strategies to the extent that no other combination of strategies can increase at least one person s payoff without reducing the payoffs of others , then the outcome is pareto optimal .",
    "in other words , an outcome is pareto optimal if no other outcome can help some players without adversely affecting others .",
    "but in many cases , it is not guaranteed that a nash equilibrium is also pareto optimal .",
    "the most famous example where nash equilibrium and pareto optimality differ is prisoners dilemma .",
    "in the traditional version of the prisoner s dilemma , the police have arrested two suspects ( alice and bob ) and are interrogating them in separate rooms . each has two choices ( i ) to cooperate with each other and not confess the crime ( @xmath30 ) , and ( ii ) to defect to the police and confess the crime ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "payoff matrix for this game reads : @xmath32 the values in the above table can be explained as follows- @xmath33 means 1 year in jail while @xmath34 means 10 years in jail . 0",
    "represents the life sentence while 5 implies not to spend any time in jail .",
    "no matter what the other suspect does , each can improve his own position by defecting to the police . if the other defects , then one had better do the same to avoid the harsh punishment ( 0 payoff or life sentence ) .",
    "if the other cooperates , then one can obtain the favorable treatment accorded a state s witness by defecting to the police(a payoff of 5 implieng no jail term ) .",
    "thus , defecting is the dominant strategy for each .",
    "but when both defect , the outcome is worse for both than when they both cooperate . thus cooperate , i.e. , @xmath35 is pareto optimal strategy .",
    "the aforesaid is the description of pure strategies in classical prisoner s dilemma .",
    "lets find out what happens if both play a mixed strategy .",
    "lets consider a repeated play of the game in which @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the probabilities with which @xmath30 is played by alice and bob , respectively . the strategy @xmath31 is then played with probability @xmath38 by alice , and with probability @xmath39 by bob , and the players payoff relations read @xmath40 the strategic pair @xmath41 is nash equilibrium when @xmath42 for the payoff matrix ( [ pd ] ) these inequalities generates a strategic pair @xmath41 = @xmath43 i.e , @xmath44 is the nash equilibrium for mixed strategies too @xcite .",
    "one of the first things to be considered in quantum games was the advantage of a player with access to a full set of quantum strategies over one who is restricted to only classical strategies .",
    "s. j. van enk and r. pike in @xcite compare quantum games to classical games as regards their utility to quantum information processing .",
    "firstly , they question the extent to which a quantum game solves the classical game .",
    "they argue that in a quantum game scenario , we can not obtain a better payoff using a quantum strategy over a classical pure strategy .",
    "secondly , they argue that introduction of an entangled state allows players to make use of correlations present in such a state . hence , violating the spirit of non cooperative games .    in order to illustrate this , they consider a two - player prisoner s dilemma game between alice and bob denoted by the payoff matrix ( [ pd ] ) .",
    "the dilemma is that , @xmath45 is the dominant equilibrium or nash equilibrium , but both players would prefer @xmath46 , i.e. , it is pareto optimal .",
    "the general quantization procedure as suggested in @xcite would yield a quantum payoff table :    @xmath47    where , @xmath48 is a quantum strategy defined as @xmath49 and played on a quantum game with a maximally entangled state .",
    "@xmath50 is the solution to the quantum prisoner s dilemma game wherein @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "according to the van enk - pike criterion , the quantum solutions obtained by considering the quantum strategies over an entangled state does not give a better payoff than what is possible in the classical game itself .",
    "payoffs as obtained by players playing the quantum game are expected to be greater than the players playing the classical game , but van enk - pike show that it is not the same with games like quantum prisoner s dilemma .",
    "we would like to challenge this criterion of van enk - pike , especially the fact that quantum games do nt deliver better payoffs then classical games .",
    "this is substantiated by playing a completely random strategy over an entangled quantum state using two - player hawk dove game as an example , delineated in the next section .",
    "we show that playing a random strategy over a maximally entangled state yields a better payoff then what is possible in the equivalent classical game . the main take home message of our work is elucidated in payoff table ( [ qhawkdove ] ) . in this way",
    ", we debunk van enk - pike s hypothesis that quantum games do not give higher payoff s than classical games . in our case the quantum game - `` non locally entangled game of hawk - dove '' does give better payoffs for both alice and bob than that is classically possible for both .",
    "secondly , van enk - pike s comment regarding non - local correlations violating the spirit of a non - cooperative game is fallacious .",
    "there is no stopping classical correlation being present in the classical prisoner s dilemma game .",
    "the two prisoners could be two brothers or husband - wife but that does not change the definition of the classical prisoner s dilemma game . in the quantum version too the process of introduction of quantum entanglement does not change the game .",
    "the two parties are not aware of the fact that the entangled state is distributed between them .",
    "the introduction of entanglement induces correlations non locally .",
    "finally , van enk - pike make a comment comparing the solution of the factorization problem via quantum shor s algorithm to quantum game theory . in their own words",
    "-\"no classical solution for the game of efficiently factoring large numbers is known , so quantum mechanics provides a truly novel solution . ",
    "we completely debunk this argument via our example of quantum hawk - dove game and show that the quantum game does indeed have a much higher payoff than what is possible in the classical game . in the next section",
    ", we solve the quantum hawk - dove game in detail which is followed by a discussion .",
    "in our work we debunk the van enk - pike s criterion by showing that a completely random strategy can solve the quantum game by yielding a better payoff when being operated over a maximally entangled state . in order to show that , consider a two player strategic form hawk - dove game with complete information @xcite .",
    "hawks are aggressive and always fight to take possession of a resource .",
    "these fights are brutal and the loser is one who first sustains the injury .",
    "the winner takes sole possession of the resource .",
    "however , doves never fight for the resource , displaying patience and if attacked immediately withdraw to avoid injury .",
    "thus , doves will always lose a conflict against hawk but without sustaining any injury . in case ,",
    "two doves face each other there will be a period of displaying patience with some cost ( time or energy for display ) to both but without any injury .",
    "it is assumed that both the doves are equally good in displaying and waiting for random time . in a dove - dove contest ,",
    "both have equal probability of winning .",
    "the winner would be the one with more patience .",
    "the classical payoff matrix is represented as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath5 are the value of resource and cost of injury , respectively .",
    "the cost of displaying patience and waiting is @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "for these set of values the payoff table when both alice and bob persue pure strategies @xmath59 nash equilibrium for the classical hawk dove game is @xmath44 which is also pareto optimal . to introduce the quantum version of hawk - dove game we follow marinatto and weber s scheme @xcite .",
    "this scheme has been extended to include various forms of hawk - dove game with initially entangled states in reference @xcite .",
    "the initial state @xmath60 is taken to be a maximally entangled state , @xmath61 with @xmath62 the two entangled qubits are then forwarded to alice and bob respectively who perform unitary operation on the initial state to get- @xmath63 @xmath64 describes a general strategy represented by a @xmath65 unitary matrix parametrized by two parameters @xmath66 $ ] and @xmath67 $ ] , and is given as @xmath68    the payoff operators for alice and bob are defined as @xmath69 @xmath70 the payoff functions for alice and bob are the mean values of the above operators , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "the expected payoff for either alice and bob reads @xmath72 the strategy corresponding to hawk(@xmath73 ) is represented by identity matrix @xmath74 and that corresponding to dove(@xmath31 ) is @xmath75 , the not operator , i.e. , @xmath76 + now , lets consider the strategy represented as `` @xmath77 '' as defined in @xcite : @xmath78    the solution to the game using this strategy is presented in the payoff table obtained using eqs .",
    "( [ payoffoperator ] ) , ( [ quantum strategy ] ) : @xmath79 from the payoff table ( [ qhd ] ) it turns out that the previous nash equilibrium @xmath44 is no longer the sole equilibrium solution , as both players can shuttle between `` @xmath31 '' and `` @xmath77 '' . the fact that @xmath80 = @xmath81 = @xmath82 , implies that it is pareto optimal too , but it does not give a better solution than the classical game .",
    "we now establish that using a random mixed strategy on a maximally entangled state in a quantum game scenario one can obtain a better solution .",
