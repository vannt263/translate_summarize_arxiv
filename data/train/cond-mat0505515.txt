    "the magic of a quantum computer@xcite is that it makes a virtue out of a vice .",
    "the numerical simulation of even simple quantum systems requires exponentially large storage space and exponentially long computation times .",
    "the quantum state of a collection of @xmath6 spin-@xmath7 particles , or qubits , requires @xmath8 classical variables for its description , and solving the schrdinger equation to follow its time evolution requires a conventional computer to perform up to @xmath9 operations per time step .",
    "conversely , a computer built out of quantum components would be able to exploit the massive parallelism inherent in quantum time evolution to provide fast solutions for problems that would require exponential time on conventional machines .",
    "the difficulties to be overcome in building a quantum computer are many .",
    "the quantum system at its core must be strongly isolated from the environment so as to avoid decoherence ; the unitary transformations that constitute the elementary computational steps must be performed with sufficient precision that error - correcting codes @xcite remain effective ; and , after all the quantum computation has been performed , the system must be capable of being reconnected to the outside world in such a way that the output can be read off _ via _ a measurement process that does not disturb the result .    a particularly appealing scheme for quantum computation exploits topologically protected macroscopic quantum states in many - body systems @xcite .",
    "the first examples of such topologically ordered and protected many - body quantum states were found by xiao - gang wen and qian niu @xcite in the context of the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "wen and niu observed that if we place a filling - fraction @xmath10 quantum hall state on a genus @xmath11 riemann surface ( a thought experiment only ! ) then there are @xmath12 degenerate , and essentially indistinguishable , ground states .",
    "they also observed that by creating a vortex antivortex pair in the hall fluid and then moving the vortex around one of the homology generators of the surface they could cause the system to roll over from one degenerate state to the next . since the degeneracy is lifted only by the exponentially suppressed tunneling of vortices around the generators , the coherence of a linear superposition of such states is _ topologically protected_. furthermore , as described above , such superpositions can in principle be manipulated by controlling the motion of their vortex defects , and so inducing on them representations of the braid group of vortex world - lines .    for simple systems , such as the @xmath10 hall state on a simply - connected surface ,",
    "these braid - group representations are abelian , interchange and braiding giving rise only to a phase factor .",
    "this is not sufficient for a universal quantum computer @xcite .",
    "we need a non - abelian representation_i.e . _ particles with non - abelian statistics @xcite .",
    "there are a various two - dimensional physical systems that should , in theory , have excitations with non - abelian statistics .",
    "those closest to being realized in practice are all associated with many - body wavefunctions that contain a pfaffian factor .",
    "these candidates are : i ) a quantum hall effect state seen at filling - fraction @xmath13 @xcite , ii ) an anticipated , but as yet unobserved , phase of a rapidly rotating atomic bose gas , iii ) a two - dimensional @xmath2 superconducting state  an example of which has possibly been observed in the layered sr@xmath14ruo@xmath15 superconductor @xcite . while the non - abelian statistics of these pfaffian states is still not quite adequate for the construction of a universal computer , it is still worthy of study .",
    "the mathematical origin of the non - abelian braiding in the first two candidate systems is quite technical , involving complicated linear dependences among various pfaffian wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian braid statistics of the @xmath2 superconductor is much easier to understand physically .",
    "the mechanism has been beautifully explained by ivanov @xcite and further clarified by stern _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the essential ingredient is that the core of an abrikosov vortex in any superconductor contains localized low - energy bound states whose existence is guaranteed by an index theorem that relates the phase winding number @xmath16 of the vortex to the number of branches of low energy excitations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 superconductor is unusual in that it can host a `` half - quantum '' vortex @xcite , where the phase winding is seen by only one of the two components of the electron spin .",
    "the quasiparticles bound in the core of a two - dimensional version of such a vortex are majorana , _",
    "i.e. _ they are identical to their antiparticles .",
    "further , for odd phase winding numbers , each vortex binds a zero energy mode whose field - expansion coefficient is hermitian . in the presence of @xmath17 such vortices ,",
    "the many - body hilbert space of zero - energy states is @xmath18 dimensional .",
    "this number is in contrast with the nave count of @xmath19 dimensions that would come from ( wrongly ) supposing that each single - particle zero - energy mode must be either occupied or unoccupied .",
    "because these @xmath18 independent states can not be associated with any individual vortex , the many - body state encodes highly non - local information .",
    "ivanov @xcite demonstrated that the operation of braiding or interchanging the vortices acts on this zero - energy space in the same way that braiding acts on the @xmath18 dimensional space of @xmath6-point conformal blocks in the level @xmath20 , @xmath21 wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) model .",
    "it is not surprising that this particular wzw model plays some role .",
    "it is known that it describes the low energy physics of pfaffian quantum hall state @xcite .",
    "it also describes the low energy physics of the bose gas pfaffian state @xcite , and is a component of the low energy effective action of the two - dimensional @xmath2 superconductor @xcite .    because the zero - energy states consist of an equal superposition of particle and hole , they are electrically neutral .",
    "they are also nonlocal . as a consequence they should be little affected by local impurities and external fields , and",
    "so be topologically protected .",
    "the vortices binding them , however , carry magnetic flux and so might manipulable by external probes such as stm tips .",
    "these vortices are thus potential candidates for the basic building blocks of a quantum computer .",
    "the problem is that the internal state in the @xmath18-dimensional protected zero - energy space is so decoupled from the outside world that it is hard to see how it can be measured .",
    "this read - out problem is not unique to non - abelian braid statistics .",
    "there is as yet no completely convincing experimental demonstration of even the abelian `` anyonic '' statistics in the @xmath10 hall state  although no theorist doubts that it is present .",
    "an experiment that can detect non - abelian statistics is even harder to perform .",
    "we need some method of accessing the non - abelian state by reading out the information in the protected space .",
    "one approach , at least in principle , is to use the `` fusion rules '' of the vortices to re - connect the protected states to something measurable .",
    "the vortex fusion algebra contains , in addition to the obvious rule that phase - winding number adds , a @xmath22 factor that is essentially that of the ising model primary - field operators @xmath23 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 @xcite , or of the analogous affine primary fields ( of spin zero , one - half , and one respectively ) in the @xmath24 wzw model : = , = + , = .",

    "hence @xmath25 .",
    "slightly less obvious is the identification of @xmath0 with the odd - winding - number vortex .",
    "this comes about because a pair of vortices is associated with a single zero - energy state that can be occupied ( @xmath1 ) or unoccupied ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "hence @xmath27 . the third product , @xmath28 ,",
    "is then determined by the associativity of the fusion - product algebra .",
    "the principal claim of this paper is that it is possible to use this algebra to determine some of the information in the topologically protected space by physically fusing a vortex with an antivortex and seeing if they leave behind a real quasiparticle @xmath1 .    in subsequent sections",
    ", we will fill in the details of this process . in section two",
    "we discuss the form of the zero energy solutions to the single - particle bogoliubov - de - gennes equation , focusing on the sign ambiguities which are the ultimate source of the particle - creation legerdemain . in section three",
    "we show how tunneling between nearby vortices can be used to resolve the sign ambiguity , and how braiding followed by fusing reveals details of the protected state .",
    "section four is a conclusion and discussion .",
    "an appendix describes some necessary , but technical , aspects of berry transport in a superconducting state .",
    "the topological objects that have the properties we seek to exploit are the `` half - quantum '' vortices of a thin film of @xmath2 spin - triplet superfluid , such as @xmath29he - a , or possibly the superconductor sr@xmath14ruo@xmath15 .",
    "the order parameter in such a superfluid contains an angular - moment vector @xmath30 , a vector @xmath31 characterizing the cooper - pair spin state , and an overall phase - factor @xmath32 . in a half - quantum vortex the vector @xmath30 lies along the vortex axis and the vector @xmath31 lies in plane which , for convenience , we imagine to be perpendicular to @xmath30 . as we encircle the vortex the phase @xmath33 increases by @xmath34 while the @xmath31 vector rotates through @xmath35 .",
    "although @xmath32 and @xmath31 separately change sign , it is their product that appears in the order parameter , and this is single - valued .",
    "the effect of the combined rotation is that the spin - up fermions see the order parameter phase wind through @xmath36 , while the spin - down fermions see no phase change at all .",
    "andreev reflection off the winding phase will bind low energy spin - up quasiparticles modes in the vortex core , but there will be no spin - down quasiparticle states with energy significantly less that the gap @xmath37 .",
    "because only one component of spin is involved in the low energy physics , we will from now on regard the fermions as being spinless .",
