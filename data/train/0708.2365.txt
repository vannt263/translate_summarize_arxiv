    "over the last three decades , evidence has mounted that luminous infrared ( ir ) galaxies ( lirgs ) may signpost important events in understanding the wider picture of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "first hinted at by ground based studies in the 1970s @xcite , the importance of infrared - luminous activity in galaxies was clearly demonstrated by surveys with _ iras _",
    "@xcite , which found large numbers of extragalactic sources that were bright at mid / far - ir wavelengths , and varied substantially in nature as a function of infrared ( 81000@xmath4 m ) luminosity .",
    "those sources with ir luminosities less than about @xmath5 were mainly either dwarf galaxies or relatively dustless ellipticals , where the ir emission arose almost entirely from dust grains heated by ambient interstellar light .",
    "sources with ir luminosities in the range @xmath6 contained a significant fraction of ellipticals , but with a rising number of ir - luminous disk galaxies and galaxy mergers . at ir luminosities of @xmath7 however , mergers were almost ubiquitous , with very few undisturbed disk or elliptical systems . in the bulk of these systems the ir emission was thought to arise from some combination of dense , compact starbursts , and deeply buried agn .",
    "surveys with _ iso _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and scuba ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then showed that lirgs become increasingly common with increasing redshift , going from of order a few hundred examples over the whole sky at @xmath8 to several hundred per square degree at @xmath9 .",
    "these distant lirgs seem similar , at least superficially , to their low redshift counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "excellent reviews of the properties of lirgs can be found in @xcite , and more recently in @xcite .    that the luminous end of lirgs were discovered to be almost invariably mergers containing obscured starbursts and agn linked them to several important galaxy transformational processes , but also raised many questions .",
    "numerical simulations suggested that mergers could serve to transform disk galaxies into elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , potentially linking lirg activity to a key step in the formation of the familiar galaxy morphologies seen locally , but some recent simulations have found evidence that this may not always be the case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the exact number of merger progenitors is also controversial , with some studies finding that lirgs are mostly mergers between two galaxies @xcite , and others finding evidence for multiple mergers in a significant number of lirgs @xcite .",
    "the starbursts and agn in lirgs are obviously candidates for building up the stellar masses and large central black holes seen in ellipticals , but exactly how and when starburst and agn activity are triggered as a function of merger stage , how the star formation is distributed spatially and evolves in time , and how the starburst and agn contributions to the total ir emission can be disentangled , are still debated .",
    "two examples include the longstanding debate over the links between lirgs and qsos @xcite , and the recent suggestion that the far - ir emission from lirgs is determined more by whether the starburst or agn is the dominant feedback mechanism , rather than which is more intrinsically luminous @xcite .",
    "the issue of feedback in lirgs , in particular large - scale outflows , is also important for determining how lirgs may contribute to the enrichment of the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "the central position that lirgs seem to play in galaxy evolutionary processes at all redshifts makes their in - depth understanding of great interest . when considering studies of local lirgs there are , broadly , two approaches ; population studies of large samples to assess trends , and concentrated studies of single objects using panchromatic datasets .",
    "in this paper we adopt the latter approach , utilizing a comprehensive library of imaging and spectroscopic data to study the dynamics and power source within a nearby gas - rich interacting lirg , to understand how merger dynamics are affecting , and have affected , its starburst and agn activity .",
    "our dataset comprises imaging from the advanced camera for surveys onboard the hubble space telescope ( acs / hst ) , deep optical spectroscopy from the newly commissioned southern african large telescope ( salt ) , adaptive optics near - infrared ( nir ) imaging from the very large telescope ( vlt ) , and mid - infrared photometry and spectroscopy from the instruments onboard _",
    "spitzer_. using this dataset we ( 1 ) construct a detailed picture of the merger dynamics in this system , ( 2 ) estimate the number of merger progenitors , ( 3 ) deduce the luminosities and other relevant parameters for starburst and agn activity , ( 4 ) search for evidence for outflows , and ( 5 ) discuss scenarios of the system s evolution .",
    "we assume a spatially flat cosmology with @xmath10 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the luminous infrared galaxy iras 19115 - 2124 , also known as eso 593-ig 008 , lies at a redshift @xmath13 .",
    "it has an ir luminosity of @xmath14 @xcite , making it fall just short of a formal ulirg classification of @xmath15 , and a molecular hydrogen mass of @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "the visual wavefront sensor in mode vis - wfs 2 - 7 using a @xmath19 mag natural guide star 22 arcsec southwest of the target was used for the ao correction .",

    "this time coherent energies for the reference star ranged between 36 and 51 per cent in the individual frames , yielding sr@xmath210.18 at the location of the target galaxy in the final image .",
    "the ( auto)jittered frames were median combined to form a sky image using iraf .",
    "the sky subtracted images were then de - dithered using the centroid of a bright field star .",
    "the ao correction was sufficiently stable over the whole observation that 23 out of the 24 frames obtained on april 13 were used to median combine the final image .",

    "were median combined to form the final frame with 2160 sec total integration time .",

    "the resulting zero - point is also consistent with the eso provided photometric standard star calibration , and we estimate the absolute vega - based magnitude to be accurate to within @xmath22 mag . the astrometric solution was found using gsc2 field stars .",
    "four were available in the fov , and the rms of the fit was 0.09 arcsec ; the absolute gsc2 system has an uncertainty in the range 0.20.5 arcsec for individual stars .",

    "can masses determined from velocity dispersions and rotational velocities calculated from optical emission lines be trusted for dynamical mass estimates ?",
    "the answer depends very much on how closely the velocities and structures of warm ionized gas are coupled to the stellar stuctures and velocities . from the outset , there is no reason to expect closely matching correlations since the optical emission lines trace regions well outside the more extincted nuclei and since the very clumpy and disturbed nature of nuclear regions in ( u)lirgs make correspondences highly complicated .",
    "recently @xcite presented a detailed study of a sample of 11 ulirgs with angular resolutions of approximately 1 kpc throughout , and covering a range of ulirg types , utilizing optical integral field spectroscopy ( tracing the gas distribution with h@xmath31 light ) , medium - resolution keck and vlt near - ir spectroscopy ( tracing stellar light with co absorption bands ) , and millimetre co observations ( tracing the cold gas structures ) .",
    "they find , as expected , that in general over a few kpc the ionized gas has a complex velocity structure , with the peak - to - peak velocity differences , and often also velocity dispersions , dominated by tidal tails and tidally induced flows , rather than rotational systems ( though they do find ionized gas matching stellar velocities much more accurately than the molecular gas ) .",
    "however , they also show that the _ central _ warm gas velocity dispersion correlates well with the stellar velocity dispersion ( they find a ratio of @xmath32 ) and conclude that the central ionized gas velocity dispersion is , in fact , a robust tracer of dynamical mass of these systems , _ provided _ the emission lines in question can be spatially associated with the true nuclei identifiable virtually only by high - resolution near - ir imaging .",
    "we also note that @xcite found a good correlation between the widths of emission lines , the ca ii triplet widths , and of the absolute k - band brightness of their sample of ulirgs .    during this study",
    "we have seen exactly the problems posed in the @xcite work  without the extremely high quality near - ir imaging it would have been impossible to determine which features in the optical spectra correspond to nuclear and surrounding locations .",
    "for example , we are now able to tie the systemic velocity to the nucleus of a major component , rather than a bright off - centre region where the literature value seems to have originated from .",
    "we have furthermore been very conservative in deblending velocity structures in spectral profiles within the nir ao - determined nuclear regions to account for outflows and thus avoided over - estimating masses by factors of 24 because of them .",
    "we thus conclude that the optical spectroscopic method of defining kinematics and dynamics of the bird system , in conjunction with nir ao imaging , should be robust and reflect true dynamical masses within observational errors .",
    "the heart spiral galaxy has an absolute brightness of @xmath33 and its rotation velocity is @xmath34 km s@xmath2 .",
    "placing these values into a @xmath3-band tully - fisher relation diagram @xcite , we see that it lies well inside the expected 3@xmath35 region of normal disk galaxies , on the fainter and/or faster rotation side of the relation ; the small offset might be partially explained by under - estimated brightness due to extinction , or perhaps by dynamical effects due to the on - going interaction .      averaged within the respective half - light radii of the heart ( 1.2 kpc ) and body ( 2.5 kpc ) components ,",
    "we calculate @xmath3-band surface brightnesses of 14.8 mag arcsec@xmath36 and 15.8 mag arcsec@xmath36 . positioning these on the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies , we find them both to occupy typical regions of ( u)lirgs @xcite , i.e.  well within the scatter of the relation over different types of objects , but typically 12 mag brighter than ordinary hot e / s0 galaxies . that our nuclei , together with other ( u)lirgs , occupy regions relatively close to the fundamental plane is commonly interpreted as evidence that these objects are ellipticals in formation .",
    "following @xcite we define an escape velocity @xmath37 at radius @xmath38 for a singular isothermal sphere truncated at @xmath39 as @xmath40^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the rotation speed of an object in orbit .",
    "the escape velocity is not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath42 , though this ratio is likely to be large ( @xmath43 ) since the dark matter halo extends far from the optically observable galaxy .",
    "choosing @xmath44 and using @xmath45 km  s@xmath2 ( heart rotation ) as the extreme case , we get @xmath46 km  s@xmath2 . if the radial velocities of the components are close to the true relative velocities , it would be unlikely that any significant fraction of the outflow material or sub - systems are escaping into the intergalactic medium",
    ". the 350400 km  s@xmath2 relative radial velocity offsets of the head and the nw wing are , however , sufficiently close to the @xmath37 that it is difficult to say whether they are truly bound or not . if one considered only the velocity dispersions in the two nuclei , which are at most @xmath47 km  s@xmath2 , the escape velocity would be @xmath48 km  s@xmath2 meaning that the head , wings , and much of the outflows would be heading out of the system based on radial velocities only .",
    "the bird consists of two massive components , one still a clear spiral , and the other a disturbed disk / bulge system , of two tidal tails / wings , and an extra , but rather massive , irregular component with many individual bright star - forming regions .    though there have been reports of a significant fraction of ( u)lirgs being mergers of multiple components @xcite ,",
    "most surveys tend to agree that they usually are interactions and mergers of two galaxies , with the incidence of multiple mergers less than 5 per cent @xcite .",
    "the complicating factor , acknowledged in all ( u)lirg studies , is that any studies made in the optical regime , even at i - band , suffer from very complex extinction effects making photometric or morphological identification of nuclei difficult . in the case of the bird ,",
    "if only the @xmath24-band were considered , we would have 6 bright clumps ( measured in 600 pc diameter radii ) of @xmath49 mag , which was selected as the cut - off between legitimate nuclei and giant star - forming regions in ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "only our naco image reveals that three of those clumps are in fact the nucleus and two spiral arms of the same galaxy , and one of the clumps is a bright knot within the tail of the bird , clearly a minor feature in the system .",
    "it is the more irregular feature , the head of the bird , which we are now concerned with .",
    "is it a legitimate nucleus , a remnant of a pre - existing galaxy , or merely a collection of star clusters , formed out of the material of the other two main components during the interaction , for example a tidal dwarf galaxy ( tdg ) ?",
    "it is clear that the differences in brightness are not that large between the three components . in the b - band and i - band , the head is in fact the brightest single feature in the whole interacting system . even in the @xmath3-band , which more closely follows the underlying mass ,",
    "the head is only 1 mag fainter than the brightest component of the whole system .",
    "the dynamically derived mass for the head ranges from one - third to one - sixth of the most massive component , depending on the method used .",
    "the co - line measurements of @xcite indicate an h@xmath50 mass for the head of not less than half of the most massive h@xmath50 component ( fig .",
    "[ mirafig ] ) . finally , even the brighest nir knot alone , which is totally obscured in the @xmath23-band image , has @xmath51 and @xmath52 , making it very close to the e.g.  the @xcite criterion for individual nuclei .",
    "furthermore , the head is kinematically totally separate from the heart and body structures , with a difference in velocity nearly 400 km  s@xmath2 ( see fig .  [ rotdispvel ] ) .",
    "it also has evidence of rotation , suggesting a self - gravitating body .",
    "the appearance of the optical morphology is that of two gas rich disks colliding almost perpendicularly , with the nir image revealing the heart nucleus to be likely associated with the horizontal disk component ( the wings ) and the body nucleus being more likely associated with the vertical structure comprising also the tail  and potentially the head .",
    "however , given the clearly discrepant velocity ( and the significant stellar mass of the head ) , it is difficult to imagine the head being material merely ripped off a galaxy that originally had the body component as its nucleus , and that component remaining such a conspicuous single nucleus .",
    "in fact , the optical images show a large obscuring dust region crossing perpendicularly the e - wing , and also extending some 6 kpc to the e and ne of the head .",
    "this structure looks as if it could be separate from the two major horizontal and vertical components ; and if this is true , it could be material from the same structure as the stellar component associated with the head .",
    "the gas velocity ( @xmath53 km  s@xmath2 ) of this structure can be traced 4 kpc north out of the main head area in nir ( pa=192 ; fig  [ rotdispvel ] ) and together with the velocity at the eastern tip of the e - wing ( @xmath54 km  s@xmath2 ) , suggest a common kinematic origin with the head ( @xmath55 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "though the final answer warrants detailed dynamical merger simulations out of the scope of this paper , we propose that the data presented here strongly suggests a near - ulirg merger of three pre - existing major components . the bird would be , to our knowledge , the most - detailed studied case thus far . for",
    "a possible triple merger case of a lower luminosty lirg see @xcite .      we discuss next whether there is a possibility of an agn contribution to the overall luminosity of the bird , based on both optical and mir considerations .",
    "first of all , there are no broad lines anywhere in the optical rss spectra , nor do the line ratios suggest clear agn activity .",
    "some line ratios close to the vs.  liner dividing region come from areas associated with outflows , and thus may be attributed to shock - heating . on the other hand , while most irac mid - ir colours of the bird are those of normal spiral galaxies , along with strong pah emission expected in starbursts contributing to the 8 @xmath56 m band , the head is redder than the other components in all irac colours , suggesting a hotter dust contribution .    to differentiate between agn and starburst origin",
    ", we examine the irs spectrum .",
    "following @xcite we calculate diagnostic line ratios : [ ] / [ ]  @xmath57 , [ ] / [ ]  @xmath58 ( the [ ] line is totally within the wide silicate absorption feature ) , and [ ] / [ ]  @xmath59 ( the [ ] line is a rather marginal detection ) .",
    "the neon line ratio by itself , and also together with the sulphur line ratio , indicates a medium excitation starburst .",
    "the marginal detection of [ ] raises the possibility of some agn contribution , but the [ ] / [ ] ratio restricts this to definitely less than 5 per cent .",
    "in addition to the fine structure recombination line ratios , the strengths of the 6.2 @xmath56 m pah feature and the 9.7 @xmath56 m silicate absorption feature ( @xmath60 ) place the bird firmly in the starburst dominated ulirg section of diagnostic diagrams in @xcite and @xcite .    thus , if there is any agn contribution from the head ( and this would perhaps be the more unlikely location considering the other two nuclei are more massive ) it is negligible compared to the total ir output of the bird .",
    "we next estimate the star formation rate using the ir data available .",
    "first , we have fitted models @xcite to the full ir sed of the bird , from nir naco and 2mass data , to the fir irs , mips , and _ iras _ data .",

    "however , in the case of ordinary core - collapse sne and the same extinction , a detection would have been possible only near maximum light .",
    "if the extinction was considerably lower , a@xmath72 @xmath73 5 , we would have detected also ordinary events anytime between the epochs of the two images or up to 5 months before the first epoch image .    given the estimated core - collapse sn rate of 1.3 yr@xmath2 we estimate a poissonian probability of 16 per cent for a sn non - detection assuming that all the core - collapse sne within the nuclear regions of the bird were slowly - declining and suffered from extinctions of less than a@xmath72 = 30 .",
    "recent observations of luminous radio sne within nuclear regions of nearby ( u)lirgs @xcite show that these events have exploded within a dense circumstellar / interstellar environment .",
    "therefore , a high rate of slowly - declining ( in nir ) sne might be expected in such environments . however , if most of the sne within lirgs behave similarly to sne observed outside nuclear starburst regions , the fact that no sne were detected is not surprising , since we were sensitive to ordinary core - collapse sne with high extinctions only near the epoch of maximum light .",
    "we next discuss possible evolutionary sequences of the bird system aided by numerical merger simulations .",

    "[ ulirg_sims ] we see that relative velocities in excess of 400 km  s@xmath2 are possible for both 1:1 and 3:1 mergers ; the body / heart : head system would more closely resemble a 3:1 merger .",
    "the peak in the relative velocity is associated with the first passage of the galaxies , which also produces a clearly defined peak in the relative star formation rate at the same time of @xmath82 ( we did not attempt to model the level of sfr here , merely the pattern as a function of time ) .",
    "it is thus possible that the star formation of the whole system is dominated by the first triggering of star formation in the head component , while the other nuclei are further into the merger and in between starburst phases .",
    "the locations of the bright nir star clusters within the very extincted regions of the head , at the edge closest to the other components , might be an indication of just such infall of the component through the tidal ism .",
    "one of the weak points of this scenario is the strikingly normal appearance of the heart nucleus .",
    "however , given that the head is lower in mass by at least a factor of three than the heart , it is plausible that the head is experiencing stronger tidal effects compared to the heart , leaving it more or less undisturbed .    using the masses for individual components from section  [ masses ]",
    ", the minimum mass for the end result , derived from dynamics , would correspond to a @xmath83 galaxy ; total system mass from m / l relations is of the order @xmath84 .",
    "the end result masses are quite high , though not exceptional .",
    "numerous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate the end products of gas - rich spiral mergers , seen as lirgs and ulirgs , will be intermediate mass sub-@xmath85 ellipticals .",
    "the iras  19115 - 2124 system is thus towards the high end of masses of local ir bright systems , but nevertheless still well below the classification of a giant elliptical @xmath86 .",
    "finally , there are numerous bright concentrations within the bird , and we have not studied them in detail in this work .",
    "we note , however , that many of them might be candidates for being , or becoming , tidal dwarf galaxies . as an example the blue concentration within the tail , 3.5 arcsec south of the body , is compact , distant , and massive ( from nir light ) enough to satisfy the survival criteria for tidal dwarfs @xcite .",
    "as far as the ( u)lirg phenomenon is concerned , the accummulated wisdom indicates that the source of the huge ir luminosity comes from either agn or nuclear star formation , or both , and in the case of the bird we have shown that the star formation ovewhelmingly dominates .",
    "for both cases the idea is that the central engine is fed by infalling gas from the gas - rich progenitor disks , and that this infall is greatly facilitated by bars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references ) .    somewhat surprisingly , however , the majority of mir output of the bird system is not coming from either the major nir bright galaxy nucleus ( body ) with its embedded bar - like structure , or from the barred spiral nucleus ( heart ) .",
    "the irac and mips imaging clearly indicate that the head is the source of the bulk of mir flux , with secondary contribution from the heart , while the contribution from the body is negligible .",
    "the reason for non - conspicuous star formation in the major nuclei is not the dearth of fuel for star formation ; the co observations clearly show that there is an ample reservoir of molecular hydrogen in all of the major components ( fig .",
    "[ mirafig ] ) .",
    "this would indicate that none of the nuclei have yet experienced the second , or later , star formation peaks expected from merging models ( see fig  [ ulirg_sims ] ) .",
    "there are recent reports of major off - nuclear and disk ( rather than centrally concentrated ) star formation in interacting galaxies , @xcite , and even cases of non - enhanced or very moderate star formation connected with interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies highlight the fact that the triggering mechanism of star formation in interactions is still far from understood .",
    "all these cases are , however , in lower luminosity systems .",
    "the bird is thus quite unique in the sense that it is so close to being classified as an ulirg , and still is not dominated by a central starburst in the major components . or , if the head component were to be considered as a major nuclear location , the starburst is not associated with those gas - rich locations with bar structures .",
    "that strong star formation is present in the head need not , of course , be surprising in itself ; as discussed above , we may be witnessing the head interaction during its first passage by the two other nuclei that are further along their merging sequence .",
    "it is the timing which is more unique ",
    "ulirgs are typically observed in later stages of interactions , and first passage starburst moments with associated large relative velocities are rarely seen @xcite .",
    "in summary , the existence of large gas reservoirs and connected bar structures in merging disk galaxies do not automatically imply a central star - burst in that location . on the other hand",
    ", general merger modelling does predict epochs of lower sfr in between more intense episodes . in the case of the bird",
    "it seems that the more massive nuclei are in such a phase , while the least massive component is caught virtually in the act of first high - speed fly - by .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate further what are the factors inhibiting the ( u)lirg phase in the body nucleus , for example , or why exactly it has switched off .",
    "we have studied in detail the spectacular luminous infrared galaxy iras  19115 - 2124 , which we have dubbed the bird . using near - diffraction limited adaptive optics imaging in the k - band ( vlt / naco ) , and matching space - based optical imaging ( hst / acs ) , combined with ground - based optical spectroscopy ( salt / rss ) , we find the bird to be a pre - merger of three components .",
    "two of the components have unambiguously identifiable galaxy nuclei .",
    "one has the quite regular composition of a barred spiral disk galaxy ( heart ) while the other ( body ) has a more disturbed nuclear region , with hints of both spiral / arm structure and a surface brightness profile intermediate to that of disks and ellipticals .",
    "the third component ( head ) appears to be an irregular galaxy  our kinematical and dynamical data , however , strongly suggest that it is not merely a tidal dwarf borne out of the interaction of the other two , but rather a pre - existing less massive galaxy intimately involved in the interaction .",
    "the ao nir imaging is crucial in classifying sources and nuclei due to the extremely clumpy nature of sources of this kind in the optical .",
    "in addition , we see strong tidal tails ( the wings ) and numerous concentrated knots , some of which may be candidate tdgs , and find a bright luminosity function for candidate sscs .",
    "the combination of high - resolution imaging and spectroscopy has resulted in the refinement of the systemic velocity of this lirg , @xmath87 km  s@xmath2 , and we have listed the kinematics of all the components .",
    "we have also investigated the line ratios , equivalent widths , and profiles of the important emission lines and find them to show characteristics of an type galaxy .",
    "we identify blueshifted  d absorption doublets mainly from the heart , head , and body components .",
    "we interpret these to be due to gas outflows from the bird , with velocities typically in the range @xmath88 km  s@xmath2 , but possibly some flows ranging up to 600 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "consistently , we also identify elevated [ ] /h@xmath31 levels in blueshifted wings of emission lines from the nuclear components , suggesting shock - heating associated with outflows .    by utilizing _",
    "irac and mips imaging , we are able to pinpoint where the mir flux and the non - stellar emission is originating from .",
    "the heart and especially the head components are the regions producing most of the mir flux .",
    "there is a hotter dust component affecting the @xmath89 m bands at the location of the head : _ spitzer _ irs spectroscopy is used to confirm the classification suggested by our optical spectroscopy , that this location , and the bird system as a whole , is a star formation dominated system , with any agn contribution below 5 per cent .",
    "the star formation is estimated to be @xmath90 , corresponding to a core - collapse supernova rate of @xmath731.3 yr@xmath2 .",
    "we detected no supernovae brighter than @xmath91 in nir images separated by 5 months .",
    "we estimate averaged extinction over the system to be of the order a@xmath92 , while the extinction derived from mir diagnostics of the deeply embedded nuclear system results in a@xmath93 .",
    "gas masses inferred are up to a level of @xmath94 .",
    "we have determined the component masses of the bird system using rotational as well as central velocity dispersion information .",
    "we note that without the high - resolution nir imaging it would have been very difficult to differentiate between velocity components related to nuclear bulges from those originating e.g.  from regions in tidal regions or outflow components .",
    "using conservative deblending of components we arrive at masses of 0.27  @xmath85 , 0.36  @xmath85 and 0.08  @xmath85 for the body , heart , and head , respectively . alternatively , using k - band light as a tracer , we find masses of 0.40  @xmath85 , 0.25  @xmath85 and 0.16  @xmath85 for the inner 1  kpc regions of the same three regions , and 2.1  @xmath85 for the total system .    in summary , most optical , nir , mir , and",
    "fir emission characteristics , as well as kinematical and dynamical attributes place iras  19115 - 2124 among typical ulirg samples , even though it is not technically quite a ulirg with an ir luminosity of @xmath95 .",
    "the main differences are that it appears to be a three - component merger , and that its total dynamical mass is of the order of @xmath96 , or more , i.e.  at the upper end of typical ulirg merger remnants . finally , we find the likely origin of the ulirg phase engine to be the head , the least massive of the three merger components , and the only one without signs of spiral arms and bars , which often are regarded as tell - tale signs of inflowing gas to central starburst regions .",
    "a possible sequence of events is such that the heart and body met first ; the body especially is already in the process of morphing into an elliptical like structure .",
    "the head is observed during its first high - speed approach to the system , making it the strongest starburst at this time  the general characteristics of this scenario are consistent with numerical merger simulations .",
