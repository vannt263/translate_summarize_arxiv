    "natural proteins reach their native conformation in biologically relevant time scale of about a second or less starting from an ensemble of denatured conformations @xcite .",
    "the native state of proteins is also stable ( albeit marginally ) under physiological conditions @xcite .",
    "the underlying energy landscape of random sequences is far too rugged @xcite to be navigated in biologically relevant time scale .",
    "thus , it is believed that protein sequences have evolved so that the dual requirements of stability and kinetic accessibility of their native states are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "an important question that arises from this observation is : what are the sequence dependent properties of proteins that govern their foldability ?",
    "the sequences that satisfy the above stated dual requirements are considered to be foldable , and hence are biologically competent .",
    "this and related questions have attracted considerable theoretical attention over the last several years @xcite .",
    "minimal protein models @xcite , which capture some but not all the energetic balances in proteins , are particularly suited to provide a detailed answer to the question posed here .",
    "there have been three proposals in the literature , which have attempted to identify the characteristics of sequences that give some insight into the foldability .",
    "below we briefly describe the three criteria following the order of their appearance in the literature :    1 .   by using the random energy model ( rem ) as a caricature of proteins",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that foldable sequences have large values of @xmath10 where @xmath3 is the folding transition temperature and @xmath11 is an equilibrium glass transition temperature , which in the original rem model is associated with the temperature at which the entropy vanishes .",
    "it has been subsequently realized that in order to utilize this criterion in lattice models @xmath11 has to be replaced by a kinetic glass transition temperature @xcite .",
    "theoretical considerations and lattice and off - lattice model simulations show that for optimal foldable sequences the collapse transition temperature is relatively close to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in other words , sequences that fold extremely rapidly have small values of @xmath12 where @xmath2 is the temperature at which the polypeptide chain makes a transition from the random coil state to a set of compact conformations .",
    "the characteristic temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath3 are _ equilibrium properties _ that can be altered by not only changing the external conditions , but also by mutations @xcite .",
    "the collapse transition temperature is , in principle , measurable from the temperature dependence of the radius of gyration , which can be measured using small angle x - ray scattering ( or neutron scattering ) experiments .",
    "we have shown that , depending on the values of @xmath8 , the very nature of the folding kinetics can be dramatically altered @xcite .",
    "in particular sequences for which @xmath13 ( here the process of collapse and the acquisition of the native state is _ indistinguishable _ )",
    "fold by two state kinetics .",
    "such sequences are also stable over a wider variety of external solvent conditions . on the other hand , sequences ,",
    "for which @xmath8 is relatively large , exhibit more complicated kinetics @xcite .",
    "finally it has been argued that the `` necessary and sufficient '' conditions for a sequence to be foldable is that there be a large energy gap ( with dimensions @xmath14 ) or the native state be a `` pronounced '' minimum in energy @xcite . the validity of this criterion , even for lattice models , has been questioned in several articles @xcite .    in general , sequences which fold rapidly ( small values of @xmath8 )",
    "are most easily generated by performing some sort of optimization in sequence space .",
    "one popular way of getting optimized sequences is to minimize the dimensionless @xmath9-score @xcite defined as @xmath15 where @xmath5 is the energy of the native state , @xmath6 is the average energy of the misfolded ( or partially folded ) states , and @xmath16 is the dispersion in the contact energies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate if the folding rates are correlated with the @xmath9-score in a manner similar to the correlation between folding times @xmath17 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we show , using a database of several lattice models of proteins , that there is a significant correlation between @xmath0 and the _ dimensionless quantity _ @xmath9-score .",
    "the correlation , however , is not as strong as that seen between @xmath0 and @xmath8 at least in these models .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the models and the computational protocol . in section",
    "iii the stability of the native state under the simulation conditions is established .",
    "the correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath8 and the @xmath9-score are also discussed .",
    "we also establish an appropriate relationship between @xmath8 and the @xmath9-score .",
    "the paper is concluded in section iv with some additional remarks .",
    "we model a protein sequence as a self - avoiding walk on a cubic lattice with the spacing @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "a conformation of a polypeptide chain is given by vectors @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the value of @xmath21 for three sequences is 36 and for the remaining nineteen sequences , @xmath22 . if , two nonbonded beads @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are nearest neighbors on a lattice , i.e. , @xmath26 , they form a contact .",
    "the energy of a conformation is given by the sum of interaction energies @xmath27 associated with the contacts between beads @xmath28 where @xmath29 is unity , when @xmath30 and is zero , otherwise .",
    "we have used three forms for the contact matrix elements @xmath27 which mimic the diversity of interactions between various amino acids .",
    "sixteen sequences with @xmath22 in this study have the contact matrix elements @xmath27 obtained from a gaussian distribution @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the average attraction interaction and the dispersion @xmath33 gives the extent of diversity of the interactions among beads .",
    "the energies for these sequences are measured in terms of @xmath33 which is set to unity ; @xmath32 is taken to be @xmath34 .",

    "an additional rb 27-mer sequence was included in our database during the course of this work to expand the range of @xmath8 values .",
    "of the sixteen sequences nine have maximally compact native states , while the remaining seven sequences have non - compact native structures .",

    "we perform monte carlo simulations ( for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and determined @xmath2 and @xmath3 using multiple histogram technique @xcite , which is described in the context of protein folding elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , @xmath2 is associated with the peak of the specific heat @xmath36 as a function of temperature . such estimates of @xmath2 coincide with the peak in the derivative of the temperature dependence of the radius of gyration @xmath37 @xcite .",

    "so that @xmath43 ( see eq . ( [ sigmat ] ) ) for this sequence is 0.30 .",
    "we also computed the @xmath9-score ( see eq .",
    "( [ zscore ] ) ) for the twenty two sequences .",
    "the values of @xmath44 were calculated as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of contacts in the misfolded structures and @xmath47 is the average contact energy for a particular sequence .",
    "the dispersion @xmath16 is determined from @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the average of the square of contact energies . in general",
    ", @xmath46 is equal to the number of contacts in the native state which for maximally compact structures is 28 for @xmath22 and 40 for @xmath35 .",
    "the kinetic simulations are done at sequence dependent temperatures @xcite , which were determined by the condition @xmath50 .",
    "this criterion for choosing @xmath51 allows several sequences to be compared on equal footing regardless of topology and the nature of interaction potentials used .",
    "the value of @xmath52 is chosen so that @xmath53 for all sequences .",
    "this ensures that the native conformation or more precisely the native basin of attraction is the most dominant at @xmath54 .",
    "the folding times are calculated from the time dependence of the fraction of unfolded molecules , @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath55 may be computed from the distribution of first passage times .",
    "operationally for every sequence an ensemble of initial denatured conformations ( obtained at @xmath56 ) is generated .",
    "for each initial condition the temperature is reduced to @xmath51 and the dynamics is followed till the first passage time is reached .",
    "typically we generated between 200 to 500 independent trajectories in order to reduce the statistical error in determining @xmath0 to about 5% .",
    "* ( a ) stability of the native basin of attraction : * due to the discrete nature of spatial and energetic representation the native state of lattice models of proteins is a single microstate . in the coarse grained energy representation",
    "every term in the energy function has ising like discreteness ( see eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) ) .",
    "since these models represent a coarse grained caricature of proteins it is useful to define a native basin of attraction ( nba ) .",
    "this is necessary because the idea that the native state is a single microstate is clearly unphysical .",
    "the native basin of attraction has a volume associated with it .",
    "the larger such a volume is the smoother one expects the underlying energy landscape to be .",
    "the probability of being in the nba is defined as @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the value of the overlap function at the folding transition temperature @xmath3 , @xmath59 is the energy of the conformation @xmath23 , and @xmath60 is the corresponding value of the overlap .",
    "the overlap function is defined as @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the distance between the @xmath23 and @xmath24 beads and @xmath63 is the distance between the same beads in the native conformation . according to eq .",
    "( [ pnba ] ) all conformations with overlaps less than @xmath58 map onto the nba , which implies that a steepest descent quench would directly lead these conformations to the nba .",
    "the above definition of nba is physically appealing .",
    "for all the sequences @xmath3 , obtained from the peak of fluctuations in the overlap function , nearly coincides with @xmath3 determined using @xmath64 .    in order to demonstrate the stability of the nba we have calculated @xmath65 for all the sequences .",
    "recall that the sequence dependent temperatures at which the simulations are performed are chosen so that @xmath66 . in fig .",
    "( 2a ) we show @xmath65 for the twenty two sequences .",
    "for all the sequences the probability of being in the nba exceeds 0.5 , which implies that for the simulation conditions employed here the _ stability of the native state is automatically ensured_. among the nineteen 27-mer sequences fifteen are exactly the same ones as reported in our previous work @xcite , and the temperatures of the simulations are identical to those used in our earlier studies .",
    "thus , even in our earlier work the stability of the nba at the simulation temperatures has been guaranteed .    *",
    "( b ) dependence of folding times on @xmath8 : * the folding times for the 22 sequences considered here have been computed using methods described in detail elsewhere @xcite . in fig .",
    "( 2b ) we plot the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath8 .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the folding times correlate extremely well with @xmath8 under conditions when the nba is stable ( see fig .",
    "a relatively small change in @xmath8 can lead to a dramatic increase in folding times .",
    "for example , an increase in @xmath8 by a factor of four results in three orders of magnitude increase in @xmath17 .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the dual requirements of thermodynamic stability of the nba and kinetic accessibility of the nba are satisfied for the sequences with relatively small values of @xmath8 .",
    "this verifies the _ foldability principle _ which states that fast folding sequences with stable native states have @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "there are two important points concerning the results presented in fig .",
    "( 2b ) : ( 1 ) the excellent correlation shown in fig .",
    "( 2b ) should be considered as statistical i.e. , we expect to find such dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath68 only if a number of sequences over a range of @xmath8 is examined .",
    "this implies that it is not possible to predict the relative rates of folding for sequences whose @xmath8 values are close .",
    "such sequences are expected to fold on similar time scales .",
    "( 2 ) foldable sequences with small values of @xmath8 reach the nba over a wider range of external conditions than those with moderate values of @xmath8 .",
    "since not all naturally occurring proteins fold rapidly it follows that there are proteins with moderate values of @xmath8 that reach their nba by complex kinetics @xcite .",
    "this involves , in addition to the direct pathway to the native state , off - pathway processes involving intermediates .",
    "such sequences reach the nba by a kinetic partitioning mechanism @xcite .    * ( c ) relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath9-score : * the folding times as a function of the @xmath9-score for our database of sequences are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that there is a significant correlation between the two .",
    "however , the correlation here is not as good as that in fig .",
    "the plausible reasons are given in the next subsection in which the relationship between @xmath9-score and @xmath8 is explored .",
    "it is tempting to think that because the numerator of @xmath9-score is some measure of the so called stability gap one can conclude that folding rates are linked just to @xmath69 .",
    "we show below that this is not the case .    *",
    "( d ) relationship between @xmath9-score and @xmath8 : * the significant correlations between the folding times and @xmath8 and @xmath9-score suggest that there might be a relationship between these two _ dimensionless quantities_. we arrive at an approximate relationship between the two which also explains the reasons for the superior correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "the rationale for using @xmath8 as a natural criterion that satisfies the dual requirements of stability and kinetic accessibility is the following @xcite .",
    "the transition from compact states to the native state at @xmath3 is usually first order , and neglecting the entropy associated with the native state @xmath3 is approximately given by @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is roughly the stability gap and @xmath72 is the entropy of the ( non - native ) states whose average energy is roughly @xmath73 above the nba .",
    "if there is considerable entropy associated with the nba this has to be subtracted from the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ esttf ] ) .",
    "since our arguments do not really depend on this , we ignore it here .",
    "the transition from the random coil states to the collapsed states occurs at @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , is the driving force , that places the hydrophobic residues in the core and the polar residues in the exterior creating an interface between the compact molecule and water .",
    "the entropy of the intervening non - native states is a function of @xmath75 .",
    "consider the case of large @xmath75 . in this case",
    "the polypeptide chain will undergo a non - specific collapse into one of the exponentially large number of compact conformations .",
    "this renders @xmath72 extensive in @xmath21 , where @xmath21 is the number of amino acid residues in the polypeptide chain .",
    "this makes @xmath3 very low even for moderate sized proteins . in the opposite limit ,",
    "when d is small , there is not enough driving force to create a compact structure . here",
    "again @xmath72 is extensive and as a result @xmath3 becomes low .",
    "thus an optimum value of @xmath75 , which reflects a proper balance of local interactions ( leading to secondary structures ) and long range interactions ( causing compaction and formation of tertiary structure ) is necessary @xcite so that @xmath72 be small enough .",
    "this would make @xmath3 as large as possible without exceeding the bound @xmath2 .",
    "thus , optimizing @xmath76 , @xmath72 , and @xmath75 ( hence @xmath2 ) leads to small values of @xmath8 , which therefore emerges as a natural parameter that determines the folding rates and stability .    consider the spectrum of states of protein - like heteropolymers .",
    "it has been suggested , using computational models @xcite and theoretical arguments @xcite , that generically the spectrum of states consists of the nba separated from the non - native states by @xmath16e@xmath77 . above the manifold of non - native states",
    "one has the ensemble of random - coil conformations .",
    "a lower limit of the energy separating the random coil conformations and the non - native compact structures is @xmath16 , which is the dispersion in the energy of the non - native states .",
    "( in lattice models @xmath16 is associated with the dispersion in the contact energies ) . thus @xmath78 . assuming",
    "be positive .",
    "for example , if @xmath79 , then @xmath80 $ ] , where @xmath81 is a suitable constant . ] that the density of non - native structures in the energy range @xmath82 is @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 is an even integer ) we get @xmath85 , where @xmath81 is a sequence dependent constant . from these arguments",
    "it follows that @xmath86 if @xmath71 is identified with @xmath87 .",
    "thus , maximizing the ratio @xmath88 ( or minimizing @xmath8 ) is _ approximately _ equivalent to minimizing the ratio @xmath89 .",
    "it is perhaps the neglect of the entropy of the non - native states that leads to the poorer correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath9-score as compared to correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath8 ( see figs .",
    "( 2b ) and ( 3a ) ) .    *",
    "( e ) linking @xmath0 to various definitions of the energy gap : * since the numerator of the @xmath9-score is an estimate of @xmath90 , it might be tempting to conclude that there is relationship between @xmath0 and the associated energy gap . in the context of minimal models of proteins a number of definitions of the `` energy gap ''",
    "have been proposed .",
    "it is useful to document these definitions :    1 .",
    "_ standard energy gap : _ the time honored definition of the energy gap for any system ( not consisting of fermions ) is @xmath91 ,",
    "where @xmath5 is the energy of the ground ( native ) state and @xmath92 is that of the first excited state .",
    "this definition is usually deemed inappropriate for protein - like lattice models because a flip of one of the beads can lead to a trivial structural change especially for non - compact native states .",
    "such structures would belong to the nba ( see eq .",
    "( [ pnba ] ) ) . in real models in water",
    ", even a casual flip of a residue could involve substantial solvent rearrangements , resulting in significant energy ( or enthalpy ) penalty .",
    "compact energy gap : _ the compact energy gap is @xmath93 @xcite , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the energies of the native state and the first excited state respectively .",
    "the superscript @xmath96 indicates that these conformations are restricted to the ensemble of maximally compact conformations .",
    "it has been shown that the ground states of many sequences are non - compact @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in several cases the lowest energy of the maximally compact conformation is much greater than those of the manifold of non - compact non - native structures @xcite . the correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath97 is , at best , poor ( see fig .",
    "( 22 ) of ref .",
    "stability gap : _ the notion that @xmath71 should play an important role in determining both the stability and the folding rates is based on sound physical arguments @xcite .",
    "we believe that its close relation to @xmath3 makes the stability gap a very useful physical concept .",
    "@xmath9-score gap : _ this is defined as @xmath98 , which is the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ zscore ] ) .",
    "this is closely related to @xmath71 , and for practical purposes may be identical .",
    "the precise value for @xmath6 depends on the given sequence , and even the practitioner .",

    "for these two purposes the precise values of @xmath99 do not appear to be very important .",
    "since @xmath6 can be altered freely the definition of @xmath100 is somewhat ambiguous . in this article",
