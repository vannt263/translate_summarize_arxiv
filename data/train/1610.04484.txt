    "the quark substructure is not visible .",
    "the nucleons are bound together by the strong force .",
    "the replacement of nucleons by @xmath1- or @xmath2-hyperons was successfully studied , by producing them via recoil - free kinematics , i. e. they are produced at rest .",
    "bound system consisting of an atomic nucleus and another negatively charged particle , where binding appears due to the coulomb interaction , are atoms .",
    "the successful method of producing pionic atoms was again recoil free kinematics .",
    "we will come back to this point .    since the @xmath0 is electrical neutral , binding can occur only via the strong interaction .",
    "the observation of an @xmath0 bound state would be the first time that a boson is bound in a nucleus . since a boson is not effected by the pauli principle",
    ", it can be in a state where the nucleon density is maximal .",
    "observation of such a state would allow to study the in medium properties of bound objects . the @xmath0 is short lived ( @xmath3 s ) and therefore secondary beams of the are impossible .",
    "it is well known that the delta resonance @xmath4 plays a dominant role in case of pion production .",
    "it seems that the @xmath5 plays a similar role in case of @xmath0 production although cross sections in this case are much smaller .",
    "the scattering lengths of the pion - nucleon interaction is rather small and as a result the strong interaction shift in the @xmath6 state of pionic atoms is repulsive .",
    "contrary to this , the @xmath0-nucleon interaction at small momenta is attractive and rather strong .",
    "this was first pointed out by bhalerao and liu @xcite and later applied by haider and liu @xcite to predict quasi bound @xmath0 mesons in atomic nuclei for mass numbers @xmath7 . in the following text",
    "we apply the standard sign convention in meson physics @xcite for the @xmath8 wave scattering parameters @xmath9 with @xmath10 the @xmath0 momentum , @xmath11 the @xmath8 wave phase shift , @xmath12 the scattering length and @xmath13 the effective range . for",
    "a real attractive potential @xmath14 means binding .",
    "contrary to the @xmath15 systems where the scattering length is real at very small energies here the @xmath16 channel is always open and hence the scattering length is complex . from such large values for the scattering length @xmath17 , haider and liu@xcite have shown that @xmath0 can be bound in nuclei with a @xmath18 12 . in the following text we frequently use the term bound state instead of the more strict quasi bound state .",
    "this is common in the literature .",
    "a state is called a bound state in the usual sense when the sum of its constituent masses is larger than the mass of the composite . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics binding",
    "is represented by an attractive potential and the state is a solution of the radial klein - gordon equation .",
    "these solutions lie on the imaginary axis in the momentum plane with @xmath19 however , a possible @xmath0 bound state is not stable since always the interaction @xmath20 with a nucleon @xmath21 is possible .",
    "if the @xmath0 bound state was in a @xmath8-state the energy of the final state is @xmath22 with @xmath23 the kinetic energies in the final state and @xmath24 the binding energy . here",
    "we have neglected fermi motion of the nucleon and the recoil of the residual nucleus . assuming a binding energy @xmath25  mev , this leads to @xmath26  mev and @xmath27  mev .",
    "these energies are clearly too large for the two final state particles to stay in the nucleus . because of the possible decay of the state it is a quasi bound state and this fact is accounted for by a complex potential .",
    "the task is now to produce a complex potential for elastic scattering @xmath28 , construct from this a complex @xmath29 potential and then search for poles in the upper part of the second quadrant in the complex plane .",
    "the @xmath0-nucleon scattering length @xmath30 or more generally the matrix @xmath31 is quite poorly known . as stated above the lifetime of @xmath0 s",
    "is short , so @xmath17 or @xmath31 has to be extracted in rather indirect ways .",
    "the inputs are production cross sections of @xmath32 and @xmath33 reactions",
    ". also decays into the channels @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 were considered .",
    "the major mechanism that generates the imaginary part of @xmath38 is the reaction @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the nucleon resonance @xmath41 with a strong coupling to both the @xmath0 and the pion @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the deduced values for the scattering length range from @xmath42 fm to @xmath43 fm .",
    "the standard approach is to construct from the @xmath0-nucleon scattering length an optical potential for the @xmath0-nucleus interaction with @xmath44 the mass number of the nucleus , and then to solve a wave equation with this potential @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the complex optical potential is given by @xmath45 with @xmath46 the reduced @xmath37 mass , @xmath31 the @xmath0-nucleon transition matrix and @xmath47 the nuclear density .",
    "we will call this relation as the @xmath48 approximation . in the impulse approximation the relation @xmath49 with @xmath50 holds . for a bound state one needs to know the @xmath23 matrix at @xmath51 i.e. below threshold .",
    "different groups employed different wave equations to search for poles .",
    "this leads of course to different results .",
    "another source of ambiguities are the different @xmath0 nucleon scattering lengths .    here",
    "we study the importance of the input on the final result .",

    "one can either measure the @xmath0 or the fused nuclear system .",
    "the measurement of the decay of the @xmath0 into photons does not allow the conclusion that the nuclear system is in its ground state due to the limited resolution in the two photon detection .",
    "instead one measures the four vector of the fused nucleus together with particle identification and reconstructs the properties of the @xmath0 .",

    "the decomposition of the total cross section into partial waves is possible from the knowledge of spin observables in addition to cross sections . in the following paragraphs",
    "we will give some theoretical prerequisites allowing to extract the @xmath8 wave contribution from measurements .",

    "this method , originally developed in the production of hypernuclei @xcite , was successfully applied in the study of pionic atoms @xcite . in order to transfer the beam momentum almost completely to the emerging particle it has to be emitted in the forward direction close at zero degree .",
