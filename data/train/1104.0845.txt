    "loop  top flare kernels are the main sources of soft x - ray ( sxr ) emission near flares maximum and during their decay . in order to investigate energy balance of the kernels it is necessary to have reliable estimates of plasma density inside the kernels .",
    "a \" standard  method of determining the electron number density , @xmath0 , consists in a few steps :    1 .",
    "usually , the temperature , @xmath2 , is estimated from the ratio of sxr fluxes measured with two different filters : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are measured x  ray fluxes , @xmath6 are response functions for measurements with two filters ( i=1,2 ) and @xmath7 is the estimated value of the temperature . in the case of observations with the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _",
    "( rhessi , ) the temperature is estimated from the slope of sxr spectrum .",
    "+ flare kernels are multithermal ( non - isothermal ) , _",
    "i.e_. @xmath8 where @xmath9 is differential emission measure ( dem ) .",
    "therefore obtained values of @xmath7 depend on instrumental response functions @xmath6 and we obtain different values of @xmath7 from measurements with different instruments ( see table [ table ] ) .",
    "next the emission measure is calculated from the formula : @xmath10 + in many cases the response function , @xmath11 , steeply depends on temperature",
    ". then random errors of determination of mean temperature , @xmath12 , may cause significant errors of @xmath13 . to improve this standard method of @xmath13 determination , we recommend that observations having flat response functions ( low @xmath14/@xmath15 in the investigated range of temperatures ) should be used to determine @xmath13 from equation ( [ em ] ) ( see section 2 ) .",
    "then we have : @xmath16 _ i.e. _ we will obtain reliable @xmath13 from equation ( [ em ] ) , despite that the emitting plasma is multithermal .",
    "the electron number density is estimated as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the volume of emitting plasma . in order to estimate the volume",
    "@xmath18 it is necessary to assume what is the extension of emitting plasma along the line of sight .",
    "this introduces significant uncertainty into estimates of electron density from equation  ( [ n ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty is high when the shape of a flare kernel is elongated ( elliptical ) or irregular , since then it is most difficult to guess what is the extension of emitting plasma along the line of sight .",
    "+ additional drawback of standard method of density determination is due to the fact that it gives values averaged over whole volume of a kernel . in reality",
    ", the emitting plasma can have higher density if it occupies only a part of kernel volume , _",
    "i.e. _ if its filling factor is smaller than 1 .",
    "+    in our previous paper ( , hereafter paper i ) we have proposed a new method of electron density determination in which ( 1 ) it is not necessary to assume what is the extension of the emitting plasma along the line of sight and ( 2 ) which gives actual values of the electron density of emitting plasma .",
    "+ investigated models of steady - state coronal loops and they have found a `` scaling law '' of these models which can be written in the form : @xmath19 where @xmath2 is the temperature at the top of a loop , @xmath20 is the semilength of the loop and @xmath21 is the electron number density within the loop .",
    "+ those authors have found that equation ( [ rosner ] ) is also valid for hot `` post - flare loops '' having temperature up to 10 mk ( see their figure 9b ) .",
    "this last finding has been explained by who carried out hydrodynamic modeling of the evolution of hot flaring loops .",
    "they have found that if the heating rate , @xmath22 , of a flaring loop decreases slowly during decay phase , the loop evolves along a sequence of steady - state models [ quasi - steady - state ( qss ) evolution ] and then equation ( [ rosner ] ) is valid during this evolution .",
    "therefore this equation ( [ rosner ] ) can be used to determine densities @xmath0 during the qss evolution .",
    "the aim of the present paper is : ( 1 ) to improve the two methods of density determination , ( 2 ) to compare the densities obtained with the two methods .",
    "we have selected a number of flares which showed qss evolution during the decay phase .",
    "for these flares the electron density , @xmath0 , has been derived by means of standard method and with our qss method .",
    "comparison of the @xmath0 values obtained with the two different methods allowed us : ( 1 ) to test the obtained densities , ( 2 ) to evaluate the volume filling factor of the sxr emitting plasma .",
    "observations and their analysis are described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 contains summary and conclusions .",
    "long time ago it has been shown that it is useful to display flare evolution in temperature - density diagnostic diagrams ( @xcite ( @xcite ) ) . in such diagrams",
    "the qss branch of flare evolution is a straight line of inclination @xmath23 .",
    "soft x - ray images show that size of loop - top sources does not change significantly during decay phase of many flares ( _ i.e _ their volume @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore in paper  i we have found that simplified diagnostic diagrams ( where @xmath25 is replaced by @xmath26 ) derived from goes ( _ geostationary operational environmental satellites _ ) observations , are very useful for detection of the qss evolution ( see figure [ diagn ] ) .",
    "correct inclination , @xmath27 , of the qss branch in these diagrams indicates that temperature , @xmath28 , derived from _ goes _ observations , adequately represents mean temperature of emitting plasma during the qss flare evolution and therefore we should use this temperature in equation  ( [ rosner ] ) .    in paper",
    "i we have also found that temperatures @xmath29 are usually lower than @xmath28 ( sxt is the _ yohkoh_/soft x - ray telescope - see ) .",
    "this is caused by the fact that sxt has narrower spectral range of sensitivity ( @xmath30@xmath31 kev for be @xmath32 al12 filters ; @xmath33@xmath34 kev for goes ) .",
    "low values of @xmath29 result in low inclination ( @xmath35 ) of the qss branch derived with this temperature ( see and our paper i ) .     and",
    "@xmath21 for @xmath36 selected flares .",
    "estimates of random errors are given in table 1.,width=453 ]      using _ yohkoh_/sxt and goes observations we have selected @xmath36 flares which are limb or near - the - limb flares and their goes diagnostic diagrams show clear qss branch . for the beginning of the qss branch ( near point e in figure [ diagn ] ) we have determined temperature , @xmath29 and @xmath28 , and densities , @xmath37 and @xmath21 , using the sxt images and goes data .",
    "the flaring loop semilength , @xmath20 , has been calculated as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the loop height measured in the sxr image .",

    "yohkoh_/sxt with al12 filter changes only a little in wide range of temperature , @xmath48 mk [ see curve @xmath49 in figure 9 in ] .",
    "therefore , the emission measure , calculated according to equation ( [ em ] ) , only weakly depends on temperature @xmath12 . to illustrate this effect ,",
    "we have assumed a constant value of the x - ray flux , @xmath50 , and calculated @xmath13 for various values of temperature ( figure [ emvst ] ) .",
    "for al12 filter the dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath2 is weak in the range of flare temperatures .",
    "dependence of the electron density , @xmath37 , on temperature is even weaker , since @xmath51 .",
    "this explains why we obtain correct values of @xmath37 , despite of the fact that @xmath29 and @xmath52 are systematically too low .     for various values of temperature .",
    "the calculations have been carried out for a constant value of the sxr flux , @xmath50 , measured with the al12 filter ( @xmath53 dn).,width=377 ]    figure [ emvst ] displays function @xmath54/f_{i}(t)$ ] for sxt observations with al12 filter .",
    "we have calculated values of this function for @xmath29 values which are presented in table 1 . from these values of the function we obtained its mean value and random ( _ r.m.s .",

    "is due to the fact that we should assume what is extension of a sxr kernel along the line of sight .",
    "main source of random errors in the qss method of density determination is due to uncertainty in estimates of the flaring - loop semilength , @xmath20 .",
    "estimates of @xmath20 are usually based on assumption that the shape of the loop is semicircular and ( in the case of limb flares ) that the loop lies in the plane of image .",
    "deviations from these assumptions are the main source of random errors in the qss method of electron density determination .",

    "the values of the ratio @xmath47 are given in table [ table ] and their distribution is shown in figure [ hist ] .",
    "we see that for two flares ( no .",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 ) the values of @xmath47 are highest ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "sxr images of these two flares are shown in figure [ 18_19aug98 ] .",
    "we see that their sxr kernels are elongated .",
    "the volumes , @xmath18 , of such kernels were calculated under assumption that they have `` sausage - like '' shape _",
    "i.e. _ that they are ellipsoids with semiaxes @xmath71 .",
    "the high values of the ratio @xmath47 suggest that actual volume of the sxr emitting plasma is significantly larger , _",
    "i.  e. _ the third semiaxis is larger than @xmath72 .",
    "this indicates that estimates of @xmath37 for such elongated kernels can be loaded with highest random errors .",
    "therefore , we have excluded these two large values of @xmath47 from calculation of the mean value @xmath73 . we have obtained : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is random ( r. m. s. ) error of single estimate of @xmath47 .        in figure [ hist ]",
    "we see that @xmath47-values are concentrated around this mean value .",
    "the value of @xmath73 which is close to one , confirms the good agreement between @xmath37 and @xmath21 values .",
    "we see that random ( _ r.m.s .",
    "_ ) error , @xmath75 , of @xmath47-values is about @xmath76 .",
    "assuming that contribution of random errors of @xmath37 and @xmath21 to this random error of @xmath47 are similar in size , we conclude that random error of a single determination of @xmath37 or @xmath21 is about @xmath77 .",
    "the values of @xmath37 , obtained with the standard method , are mean electron number densities averaged over the sxr - kernel volume .",
    "but the qss method of density determination provides actual density of the emitting plasma .",
    "therefore , the ratio , @xmath66 , provides an estimate of the fraction of kernel s volume which is filled with the sxr emitting plasma ( `` filling factor '' ) . in figure [ hist ]",
    "we see that @xmath47-values are concentrated around @xmath78 which means that , typically , near the flare maximum the kernel s volume is nearly entirely filled with the hot sxr emitting plasma .",
    "remaining , ( @xmath79 ) , fraction of the volume can be filled with plasma of lower temperature , @xmath80 mk , whose contribution to the investigated sxr emission is marginal .",
    "values @xmath81 are due to random errors in both methods of density determination .",
    "we have found that simplified diagnostic diagrams ( @xmath2 vs. @xmath82 ) , derived from goes observations , are adequate to identify quasi - steady - state ( qss ) phase of flare evolution .",
    "correct inclination , @xmath27 , of the qss branches in the diagnostic diagrams shows that the temperature , @xmath28 , derived from the goes observations adequately represents mean temperature of the hot , sxr emitting plasma .    for the qss branch of flare evolution we were able to determine electron number density , @xmath0 , for sxr loop - top flare kernels , with two independent methods which are described in sections 1 and 2 .",
    "good agreement of the @xmath0-values obtained with the two methods confirms reliability of the densities derived from _ yohkoh_/sxt images . in section 2",
    "we have explained why we obtain correct @xmath37 electron densities , despite of the fact that _ yohkoh_/sxt temperatures are systematically too low .",
    "we have obtained that electron density near the sxr flare maximum falls within the limits of ( @xmath57)@xmath83 cm@xmath59 , but in one case of strong , compact flare it was extremely high ,",
    "@xmath85 @xmath86 cm@xmath59 .    densities , @xmath37 , derived from sxr images , are mean electron densities averaged over sxr flare kernels . but the densities , @xmath21 , obtained with the second ( qss ) method , provide actual densities of emitting plasma .",
