    "the recent detection of extended red emission ( ere ) in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy by gordon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the spectroscopic confirmation of its luminescence band nature by szomoru & guhathakurta ( 1998 ) fundamentally changed our perception of the ere as an interstellar process in several ways .",
    "one , the ere is no longer seen as a phenomenon limited to localized special environments , such as reflection and planetary nebulae . as a galaxy - wide process ,",
    "its characteristics must now be imposed as an additional observational constraint on models for interstellar dust in the diffuse ism .",
    "two , by correlating the ere intensity with the column density in the diffuse ism at intermediate and high galactic latitudes , and thus with the dust column density , it has become possible to determine the efficiency with which uv / visible photons of the interstellar radiation field absorbed by interstellar dust are converted into ere photons . an ere photon conversion efficiency of ( @xmath1)% ( gordon et al.1998 ; szomoru & guhathakurta 1998 ) was derived by assuming the the ere agent consumes _ all _ photons absorbed by dust in the 91.2 - 550  nm wavelength range . to the extent that we know of the existence of other dust components which are not expected to contribute to the ere",
    ", this assumption is false .",
    "the ere agent , most likely , is not responsible for the absorption of all absorbed uv / visible photons .",
    "thus , the derived efficiency is only a lower limit to the true , intrinsic , efficiency of the photoluminescence ( pl ) process seen as ere . however , even if the intrinsic efficiency is as high as 50% , a reasonable upper limit for naturally occurring pl , the ere agent still needs to absorb about 20% of all absorbed uv / visible photons in the diffuse ism .",
    "this can only be , if the ere agent consists of a cosmically abundant material which is capable of highly efficient pl .",
    "it appears that only carbon- or silicon - based materials fit these criteria . in this letter , we present the case for silicon nanoparticles being the component of the ism responsible for the ere .",
    "we briefly summarize the observed characteristics of the ere and refer to the original sources for the details of the observations .    1 .",
    "ere manifests itself through a broad , featureless emission band of 60 @xmath2 fwhm @xmath2 100 nm , with a peak appearing in the general wavelength range @xmath3  nm . the presence of ere has been established spectroscopically in many dusty astronomical environments , e.g.  the diffuse ism ( szomoru & guhathakurta 1998 ) , reflection nebulae ( witt & boroson 1990 ) , planetary nebulae ( furton & witt 1990,1992 ) , the orion nebula ( perrin & sivan 1992 ) , the high - b dark nebula l1780 ( chlewicki & laureijs 1987 ; mattila 1979 ) , and the starburst galaxy m82 ( perrin et al .",
    "the ere was first clearly recognized in the peculiar reflection nebula called red rectangle by schmidt et al .",
    "( 1980 ) .    2 .",
    "the ere peak wavelength varies from one environment to another , and even within a given object , the peak shifts with distance from the illuminating source .",
    "the density and hardness of the incident radiation field appear to be the determining factors .",
    "the shortest peak wavelength is seen for the ere in the diffuse ism ( @xmath4610  nm ) in the case of the relatively weak interstellar radiation field , the longest ( @xmath4820  nm ) is found on the orion nebula bar adjacent to the trapezium stars , where the radiation density is several orders of magnitude higher .",
    "the photon conversion efficiency of the ere , calculated on the basis that all photons absorbed by dust in the 91.2 - 550  nm wavelength range in a given system are absorbed by the ere agent , with the absorption of one uv / visible photon leading to the emission of at most one ere photon , has been determined to be near ( @xmath1)% in the diffuse ism ( gordon et al .",
    "1998 : szomoru & guhathakurta 1998 ) , and it is at least this high in the red rectangle and not much lower in the orion nebula and a number of reflection nebulae .",
    "this implies that the ere agent must absorb a significant fraction of the uv / visible photons in the diffuse ism and , simultaneously , possess an exceedingly high intrinsic pl efficiency , @xmath510% .",
    "since only part of the energy of an absorbed photon is converted into ere , the energy conversion efficiency of the ere agent is only about ( @xmath6)% .",
    "4 .  no ere is seen shortward of the wavelength of 540  nm .",
    "a sensitive search for pl by dust in several reflection nebulae in the 400 - 500  nm range , carried out by rush & witt ( 1975 ) , produced a null result .",
    "while found in many dusty environments , ere is essentially absent in some , e.g.  the merope reflection nebula .",
    "the absence of ere in an otherwise normal dusty interstellar environment has not been explained .",
    "5 .  among planetary nebulae ,",
    "ere was detected only in objects currently thought to be carbon - rich , in the sense that c / o @xmath7 ( furton & witt 1992 ) .",
    "this was thought to be a strong argument in favor of the carbonaceous nature of the ere carrier .",
    "this argument can no longer be maintained in light of the iso observations of c - rich planetaries ( waters et al .",
    "1998a ) which show the presence of strong spectral features of crystalline silicates in the mid - ir wavelength region . in these planetaries , the oxygen - rich dust appears to be present in the outer parts of the envelopes where material from earlier mass - loss episodes resides . in ngc 7027 ,",
    "the only planetary in which spatially resolved ere observations have been made , the ere is found most strongly enhanced in the outermost envelopes ( furton & witt 1990 ) . in a similar way , iso observations of the red rectangle by waters et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , showing the presence of oxygen - rich dust there as well , have greatly diminished the argument that the currently c - rich stellar mass outflow implies a carbonaceous nature for the ere carrier in that object .",
    "one important aspect of the ere in planetary nebulae is that the ere band is seen superimposed upon the atomic continuum only , i.e.  there is no evidence of a scattered light component .",
    "this would indicate that the dust particles in these objects are sufficiently small to be in the rayleigh limit , where scattering becomes inefficient .",
    "ere observations in planetary nebulae , therefore , imply that the origin of ere is connected with very small grains .",
    "6 .  in clumpy reflection nebulae ,",
    "e.g.  ngc 2023 and ngc 7023 , ere appears strongly enhanced in filamentary structures , coincident with surfaces of clumps seen in projection ( witt & malin 1989 ) .",
    "it was suggested that the ere in these filaments becomes activated by the exposure of carbonaceous materials to warm atomic hydrogen and uv radiation in molecular hydrogen photodissociation zones ( furton & witt 1993 ) .",
    "however , high spatial resolution observations of h@xmath8 vibrational fluorescence in ngc 2023 by field et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1998 ) showed that the correlation between ere and h@xmath8 structures is not strong .",
    "in addition to some clearly correlated structures , there are ere filaments without corresponding h@xmath8 filaments .",
    "this lack of correlation is not explainable by optical depth effects , as is the also observed case of h@xmath8 filaments without ere filaments .",
    "an analogous result was found when high - resolution h@xmath8 observations of ngc 7023 were compared to ere structures in that nebula ( lemaire et al .",
    "frequently , interstellar environments exhibiting ere also emit the near - ir emission bands ( uir bands ) attributed to large aromatic molecules , e.g.  pahs . often ( e.g.  in ngc 2023 , 7023 , 7027 , orion nebula ) both emission phenomena are seen in photodissociation zones , but their intensities are poorly correlated .",
    "in particular , in the orion bar , where both ere and uir bands have been observed , there is no correlation between their respective intensities ( perrin & sivan 1992 ) .",
    "there is therefore little support to connect the emitters of the ere and of the uir bands , except that they both occupy the same general environments and that they respond to stellar uv illumination .",
    "published models for materials causing the ere have relied on carbon - based substances , either solid - state carbonaceous solids or carbon - based molecules .",
    "the former include hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) ( duley 1985 ) , quenched carbonaceous composite ( qcc ) ( sakata et al .",
    "1992 ) , and coal ( papoular et al .",
    "1996 ) ; the latter category includes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( dhendecourt et al .  1986 ) and",
    "c@xmath9 ( webster 1993 ) .",
    "common problems are the failure to match the observed ere spectra with the required pl efficiency .",
    "the most widely advocated model involves hac ( duley et al .",
    "1997 ; furton & witt 1993 ) ; it relies upon amorphous carbon , which is already a component of several interstellar dust models .",
    "the hac pl peak varies in wavelength in response to varying the conditions of production and subsequent treatment ; the absorption spectrum in the blue and uv is smooth and does not introduce troublesome absorption features unobserved in the ism .",
    "it also explains the 3.4  @xmath0 c - h stretch feature observed in absorption along large lines of sight in the diffuse ism .",
    "the qcc model is similar in all of these respects .",
    "recent detailed laboratory studies of hac ( robertson 1996 : rusli et al .",
    "1996 , and refrences therein ) , however , have led to quantitative results which cast doubts upon hac as the ere carrier .",
    "hac is a highly efficient photoluminescing material when its bandgap is large , near 4.4 ev . when illuminated by uv radiation , this hac luminesces strongly in the blue region of the spectrum , which makes it unsuitable as an ere analog .",
    "narrowing the bandgap , e.g.  by dehydrogenation , reduces the pl efficiency of hac exponentially , so that the hac pl efficiency drops to a few @xmath10 of its maximum value when the bandgap is small enough to yield pl emission in the wavelength region where ere is observed .",
    "hac s principal problem , therefore , is its inability to meet the spectral characteristics of the ere and the ere efficiency simultaneously .    the pah model ( dhendecourt et al .",
    "1986 ) was a competing early suggestion , which attributed the ere in the red rectangle to luminescence by large pah molecules .",
    "however , even a large pah like the 13-ring hexabenzocoronene exhibits a sharply structured pl spectrum peaking near 500  nm wavelength , and smaller pahs luminesce generally at still shorter wavelengths . to obtain a broad , unstructured band as observed in the ere , dhendecourt et al .",
    "rely upon a poorly studied process of intramolecular vibrational energy randomization .",
    "the fact that ere is seen only with peaks in the 610 - 820  nm wavelength range would require substantially larger pahs than hexabenzocoronene , with a total absence of smaller pahs .",
    "a further problem with all organic luminescing materials is that their absorption spectra are highly structured as well , which should lead to observable absorption bands in the blue and uv spectral regions of highly reddened stars , which so far remains undetected . on the other hand ,",
    "the pah model has had considerable success in explaining the near - ir emission bands at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3  @xmath0 .",
    "the c@xmath9 model ( webster 1993 ) can produce reasonable spectral matches with the observed ere , especially if mixtures of differently sized fullerenes were used , but its fatal weakness is the measured pl efficiency of @xmath11 for the c@xmath9 fluorescence ( kim et al .",
    "the ere efficiency requirement is particularly difficult to match for any molecular / organic luminescent material which does not exhibit a broad continuous absorption spectrum covering the 90 - 550  nm spectral range .",
    "the ere requires the presence of a material with a bandgap near 2 ev , which naturally absorbs photons of higher energy and which converts part of the absorbed energy of these photons into ere photons with an efficiency of not less than ( @xmath12)% .",
    "in this section , we shall discuss the pl characteristics of silicon nanoparticles and how these meet the requirements posed by astronomical observations of ere . in the next section",
    ", we will explore whether such particles can form under astronomical conditions and whether cosmic abundances will permit the existence of sufficient numbers of particles of this type .    in order for materials to be efficient photoluminescing sources ,",
    "two requirements must be met : the electronic excitation resulting from the absorption of a photon must be confined spatially , and possibilities for non - radiative recombinations must be minimized . in organic luminescent materials such as pahs the confining units are individual molecules , and photon yields can be as high as 99% in some instances ( krasovitskii & bolotin 1988 ) . in the case of hac ,",
    "small aromatic islands embedded in a sp@xmath13-coordinated amorphous carbon matrix are the absorbing entities . the much higher band gap energy of the surrounding matrix confines the excited electrons to the aromatic islands , where the pl can then occur ( robertson 1992 , 1996 ) .",
    "the observation of ere in planetary nebulae , which occurs in the absence of visible scattering , confirms that the luminescing particles are small compared to conventional interstellar grains .",
    "silicon nanoparticles , which consist of crystalline silicon cores of 1 - 3  nm diameter , surrounded by a sio@xmath14 mantle , are known to be remarkably efficient pl emitters in the 1.5 - 2.0  ev energy range ( e.g.wilson et al .",
    "the quantum confinement in such zero - dimensional crystallites is responsible both for shifting the bandgap from a value near 1.1  ev in bulk crystalline silicon to values of 2.0  ev and above ( brus 1986 , 1994 ; delley & steigmeier 1993 ; delerue et al .",
    "1993 ) and for greatly enhancing the pl efficiency ( efros & prigodin 1993 ) to laboratory - measured values as high as 50% at temperatures around 50  k ( wilson et al .  1993 ) .",
    "a series of recent investigations using size - selected silicon nanostructures ( schuppler et al .  1994 , 1995 ;",
    "ehbrecht et al .",
    "1997 ; lockwood et al .",
    "1996 ) have established the correlation between the structure size and the wavelength of peak pl emission . according to these studies , silicon nanoparticles in the 1.5 - 5  nm diameter range luminesce strongly in the 600 - 850  nm wavelength range .",
    "the reported maximum pl efficiencies ocurred for sizes near 1.6  nm , corresponding to 664  nm wavelength , for two - dimensional silicon nanostructures ( lockwood et al .",
    "1996 ) and for sizes near 3.9  nm , corresponding to 726  nm wavelength , for zero - dimensional nanoparticles ( ehbrecht et al .",
    "1997 ) , and both studies reported a rapid drop in pl efficiency when going to both larger and smaller size parameters .",
    "fig .  1  the observed ere spectrum of ngc 2327 ( witt 1988 ) is plotted along with the photoluminescence of film b at room temperature from guha ( 1997 ) .",
    "film b had a porosity of 70% which corresponds to a particle size of 4  nm .",
    "we conclude from the published experimental results that silicon nanoparticles luminesce extremely efficiently ( up to 50% ) in the 600 - 850  nm range when they occur in a very limited size range from 1.5 - 5.0  nm , and not otherwise .",
    "the width of the pl band depends on the width of the size distribution present , and the wavelength of maximum pl intensity is determined by the dominant size within the distribution .",
    "the published pl spectra of silicon nanoparticles match those observed in ere sources extremely closely ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "environmental effects , such as vaporization of the smaller particles in intense radiation fields , will lead to a gradual shift of maximum pl toward longer wavelength , as observed . on the other hand",
    ", the diffuse ism with the lowest radiation densities will allow the existence of the smaller particles as well , with a resultant maximum efficiency and a very broad pl spectrum .",
    "any interstellar dust component candidate must provide positive answers to two fundamental questions .",
    "can the grains form naturally in an astronomical environment ? is the required total grain mass consistent with the cosmic elemental abundances of the constituents ?",
    "silicon monoxide ( sio ) is one of the most abundant and most strongly bonded molecules in the outflows from oxygen - rich stellar sources ; virtually all silicon in the gas phase is initially locked up in this form ( gail & sedlmayr 1986 ) .",
    "the nucleation of silicates is thought to be precipitated by the initial formation of sio clusters ( nuth 1996 ) , a conclusion supported by laboratory evidence regarding the condensation of sio ( nuth & donn 1982 ) , which showed the condensate to contain elemental silicon plus silicon oxide sio@xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that sio@xmath8 is the energetically preferred form of silicon oxide in the solid phase , while sio is preferred in the gas phase .",
    "the competition for additional oxygen atoms in the condensing cluster will leave half of the silicon atoms ultimately without a partner , if the change of state can complete itself .",
    "since this condensation occurs in a high - temperature environment ( @xmath4500 - 1000  k ) , we postulate that the resulting annealing of the condensing sio clusters will lead to a separation of the elemental silicon into a core and the sio@xmath8 into a mantle , to form the basic structure of silicon nanocrystals with oxygen passivation ( littau et al .",
    "1993 ) , i.e.  in which the dangling bonds at the surface of the silicon core are connected to oxygen atoms in the sio@xmath8 mantle .",
    "as we will show , only 5% of the total dust mass needs to remain in the form of silicon nanoparticles ; the overwhelming fraction of the condensing particles can , therefore , remain involved in the condensation of various silicates and metal oxides , as supported by astronomical observations .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that silicon nanoparticles are a product of the initial dust formation process occurring in one of several oxygen - rich outflow environments , e.g.  m - type supergiants , wn stars , type ii supernovae , and agb stars .",
    "in addition to producing the ere , these silicon nanoparticles will be subject to temperature fluctuations , resulting from absorptions of individual uv photons , and thus contribute to the near- and mid - ir thermal background radiation received from the diffuse ism .",
    "the temperature increases expected from the absorption of individual 10 ev photons ( the absorption peak of the si cores is near 125 nm ) by si nanoparticles in the 1.5 - 5 nm size range are 170 k - 60 k ( purcell 1976 ) .",
    "these are upper limits because part of the absorbed energy reemerges as ere photons , and the actual particle mass is larger than assumed here by the amount of sio@xmath8 contained in the mantle .",
    "the si nanoparticles required for efficient ere production are therefore not hot enough to cause significant emission in the 9.5 @xmath0 si - o band from their sio@xmath8 mantles .",
    "that would require temperatures in excess of 230 k. our proposal is therefore not in conflict with the conclusion of desert et al .",
    "( 1986 ) that the smallest interstellar grains are most likely carbonaceous in nature .",
    "however , the sio@xmath8 mantles should contribute to the si - o features at 9.5 @xmath0 and 20 @xmath0 in absorption , which are generally referred to as the interstellar silicate features ( whittet 1992 ) .",
    "to conclude , in contrast to some other ere candidates , silicon nanoparticles are not expected to produce spectral features which are not already observed in the diffuse ism .",
    "the question of abundance is of particular importance , especially in view of the suggested reductions in the interstellar heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen ( snow & witt 1996 ) , compared to formerly used solar abundances .",
    "silicon absorbs strongly at energies above 3  ev , with an average absorption coefficient of @xmath17  @xmath18 throughout the uv ( landolt - bornstein 1982 ) . with a density of 2.42  g  @xmath19 for crystalline silicon ,",
    "we derive a cross - section per si - atom of @xmath20  @xmath21  si@xmath22 .",
    "silicon nanoparticles luminesce with an intrinsic efficiency of about 50% ( wilson et al .",
    "coupled with the observed lower limit to the ere photon conversion efficiency of ( @xmath1)% ( gordon et al .",
    "1998 ) , this suggests that silicon nanoparticles are responsible for 20% of the uv / visible absorption in the ism . hence ,",
    "along a typical interstellar sightline of 1  kpc with an extinction of 3  mag  kpc@xmath22 in the uv and a typical dust albedo of 0.5 , silicon nanoparticles contribute about 0.3 magnitudes of uv / visible absorption .",
    "this absorption and the cross - section per atom leads to a density of silicon atoms required for nanoparticles of @xmath23  si  @xmath19 , while the hydrogen density for the chosen environment is about 1  h  @xmath19 .",
    "a similar number of silicon atoms and twice that number of oxygen atoms will be needed for the sio@xmath8 mantles .",
    "the total amount of silicon in dust is @xmath24 relative to hydrogen ; thus , by number only 36% of the interstellar silicon atoms present in interstellar dust need to be present in the form of silicon nanoparticles in order for the ere observations to be explained .",
    "the total mass of the silicon nanoparticles with mantles , when compared with the total mass of depleted interstellar atoms ( snow & witt 1996 ) amounts to less than 5% .",
    "we have examined the observed characteristics of the ere , a photoluminescence phenomenon associated with interstellar dust and seen in a wide variety of astronomical environments as excess radiation in the 600 - 850  nm wavelength range . in the diffuse ism ,",
    "about 10% of absorbed uv / visible photons contribute to the ere .",
    "the ere carrier must be a cosmically abundant material exhibiting highly efficient photoluminescene properties .",
    "silicon nanoparticles containing a few hundred silicon atoms each , surrounded by a sio@xmath8 shell , match the constraints regarding the spectrum and efficiency of the ere .",
    "interstellar silicon abundances easily suffice to provide the needed material quantities , and the nucleation of sio in oxygen - rich stellar outflows provides a likely source for their formation .",
    "we suggest that silicon nanoparticles are an abundant component of the interstellar dust spectrum .",

    "<S> the spectral nature and the photon conversion efficiency of the ere identify the underlying process as highly efficient photoluminescence by an abundant component of interstellar dust . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared the photoluminescence properties of a variety of carbon- and silicon - based materials proposed as sources for the ere with the observationally established constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we found that silicon nanoparticles provide the best match to the spectrum and the efficiency requirement of the ere . </S>",
    "<S> if present in interstellar space with an abundance sufficient to explain the intensity of the ere , silicon nanoparticles will also contribute to the interstellar 9.7  @xmath0 si - o stretch feature in absorption , to the near- and mid - ir nonequilibrium thermal background radiation , and to the continuum extinction in the near- and far - uv . </S>",
    "<S> about 36% of the interstellar silicon depleted into the dust phase would be needed in the form of silicon nanoparticles , amounting to less than 5% of the interstellar dust mass . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that silicon nanoparticles form through the nucleation of sio in oxygen - rich stellar mass outflows and that they represent an important small - grain component of the interstellar dust spectrum . </S>"
