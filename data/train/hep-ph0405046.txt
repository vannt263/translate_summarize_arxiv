    "<S> radiation from high energy electrons in an oriented crystal can be considered in a frame of the quasiclassical operator method which appears to be a most satisfactory approach to the problem . under some quite generic assumptions </S>",
    "<S> the general expression is derived for the probability of circularly polarized photon emission from the longitudinally polarized electron in oriented crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the particular mechanism of radiation depends on interrelation between the angle of incidence @xmath0 ( angle between the momentum of initial electron and axis ( plane ) of crystal ) and angle @xmath1  ( @xmath2 is the scale of a potential of axis or a plane relative to which the angle @xmath0 is defined ) . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath3 one has magnetic bremsstrahlung type of radiation ( with corrections @xmath4 which are due to inhomogeneous character of field in crystal ) . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath5 one obtains the theory of coherent bremsstrahlung , while for @xmath6 one arrives to the modified theory of coherent bremsstrahlung . at high energy radiation in oriented crystals </S>",
    "<S> is strongly enhanced comparing with standard bremsstrahlung . </S>"
