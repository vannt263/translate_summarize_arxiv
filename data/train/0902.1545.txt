    "this weak compactness theorem already verifies the hamilton - tian conjecture on fano surfaces ( c.f .",

    "[ theoremin : centerwcpt ]    this is very reminiscent of the structure of the moduli space of einstein metrics with similar constraints .",
    "it is appropriate for us to comment now on some historic background in this subject .",

    "they showed that a sequence of noncollapsed einstein manifolds @xmath20 with bounded scalar curvature and energy ( riemannian curvature s @xmath21-norm ) will subconverge to an einstein orbifold in the cheeger - gromov sense .",
    "these works are fundamental and they were followed by many other papers in the following two decades .",
    "of course , they are natural extension of earlier works of cheeger  @xcite and gromov  @xcite . in  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "tian and viaclovsky studied the moduli space of a class of critical metrics , e.g. , bach - flat metrics , constant scalar curvature khler metrics , etc .",
    "one of the major difficulties there is to obtain the local volume ratio upper bound without ricci curvature control .",
    "tian and viaclovsky obtained this estimate by blowup arguments .",
    "the work of anderson s",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite also elaborated on this theme .",
    "using similar idea but more complicated estimates , in  @xcite , the first named author and brian weber showed that the moduli spaces of extremal metrics ( in the sense of calabi , c.f .",
    "@xcite ) under similar conditions are also weakly compact . in  @xcite ,",
    "bando studied the  bubble tree \" structure of the moduli space of einstein metrics , where every  bubble \" means a limit einstein orbifold .",
    "this study was generalized in  @xcite and  @xcite , where the bubble tree structure of more general moduli spaces were studied .",
    "+ in order to obtain theorem  [ theoremin : centerwcpt ] , we need two essential estimates : local volume ratio upper bound and @xmath22-regularity , i.e. , @xmath23 whenever @xmath24 . in the case of einstein metrics ,",
    "local volume ratio upper bound is an application of bishop s volume comparison theorem .",
    "@xmath22-regularity is implied by elliptic moser iteration for curvature operator since it satisfies a second order elliptic equation .",
    "if we replace einstein metrics by some other metrics whose curvature operators satisfy some second order elliptic equations , by similar method , @xmath22-regularity is still manageable . now in our case",
    ", the curvature operator only satisfies a parabolic equation .",
    "it s hard to use parabolic moser iteration to prove @xmath22-regularity property here .",
    "the difficulties come from two aspects .",
    "first , in order to control @xmath25 s @xmath26-norm by parabolic moser iteration , one requires more than @xmath21-norm of @xmath25 in a fixed geodesic ball .",
    "one needs either @xmath27-norm ( @xmath28 ) control of @xmath25 in a fixed geodesic ball , or @xmath29-norm control of @xmath25 in a ball of spacetime .",
    "neither of them is a natural condition in our setting .",
    "second , even if we can apply parabolic moser iteration , it s hard to control the local sobolev constants . note that the local sobolev constant is determined by the geometry of each unit geodesic ball .",
    "however , the unit geodesic balls at different time slices are hard to compare since we do nt have ricci curvature bound .",
    "the way we prove @xmath22-regularity is to separate it into two properties :    * _ energy concentration : _ if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 for some uniform constant @xmath22 . * _ backward pseudolocality : _ if @xmath32 , then @xmath33 for some uniform constant @xmath34 whenever @xmath35 .",
    "these two estimates together with shi s estimates on ricci flow solutions imply the @xmath22-regularity .",
    "so our object is to show that volume ratio upper bound , energy concentration and backward pseudolocality hold simultaneously for the metric @xmath36 .",
    "we ll setup these estimates by bubble analysis and contradiction arguments .",
    "our contradiction arguments follow perelman s proof of canonical neighborhood theorem ( theorem 12.1 of  @xcite ) .",
    "this means that blowup and contradiction arguments will be used repeatedly even in one proof . since the blowup arguments appear so many times , we find it is convenient to study a unique sequence of ricci flow solutions blown up from the moduli space @xmath14 first .",
    "we call such a sequence as a refined sequence . note that volume ratio , energy and backward pseudolocality are all rescaling invariant , so it will be sufficient to prove these three estimates for a refined sequence . however , a refined sequence is strongly related to a sequence of ricci flat manifolds , so the proof of such estimates is much easier .",
    "+ actually , by this arrangement , the proof of every rescaling invariant property of the moduli space @xmath14 can be reduced to the proof of this property on a single refined sequence .",
    "we believe this method is efficient and it works for every geometric flow .",
    "+ using theorem  [ theoremin : centerwcpt ] , we can build up the bubble tree for every sequence in @xmath14 .",
    "the only difficulty here is to understand the  neck \" structure .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by an application of a gap lemma ( lemma  [ lemma : gap ] ) and blowup arguments with delicate choice of blowup scales .",
    "note that isoperimetric constant is a rescaling invariant , as an application of the bubble tree , we can obtain the following estimate .    if @xmath37 and @xmath38 , then @xmath39 for some positive constant @xmath40 depending on @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "[ theoremin : centersob ]    actually , this estimate only depends on the bubble tree structure .",
    "so it can be generalized to estimates on moduli spaces of other critical metrics without too much modification .",
    "perelman ( c.f .",

    "if @xmath45 is uniformly bounded , we can apply theorem  [ theoremin : centerwcpt ] to obtain weak compactness along khler ricci flow . however ,",
    "if @xmath46 and @xmath45 is uniformly bounded , it is proved in  @xcite that riemannian curvature is actually uniformly bounded on khler ricci flow.therefore every sequence @xmath47 must subconverge to a smooth manifold @xmath48 . if @xmath49 , @xmath50 bounded is a natural condition .",
    "actually , since @xmath51 is a topological invariant ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) and scalar curvature is uniformly bounded along the flow , we know @xmath50 is uniformly bounded .",

    "this ricci bounded condition , weak compactness theorems have been studied in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "there are several new ingredients in this paper .",
    "first , we prove the energy concentration without the direct use of moser iteration on the flow .",
    "instead , we find the relation between the energy concentration of ricci flow and the energy concentration of einstein metrics , which are the critical metrics of the ricci flow . as the energy concentration of einstein metrics",
    "is well known , we can use this relation to prove energy concentration property of the ricci flow .",
    "this method should apply on general geometric flows .",
    "second , we find the  backward pseudolocality \" under special conditions .",
    "it means that a very nonflat part can not become almost euclidean in a short time under the flow",
    ". it will be interesting to see exactly what conditions can guarantee the happening of this  backward pseudolocality \" .",
    "third , we can control the  neck \" structure in bubbles without knowing precisely the order of curvature decaying around singularities .",
    "this gives us more freedom to build up the bubble tree .",
    "fourth , we re able to control the isoperimetric constants by bubble tree analysis . actually , after the bubble tree is established , the geometry at different levels of the bubble tree can be estimated by each other .",
    "therefore every rescaling invariant geometry of the moduli space can be controlled by it s deepest bubble and  neck \" structure .",
    "in particular , the isoperimetric constants can be controlled .",
