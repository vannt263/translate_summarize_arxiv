    "in fractional calculus the orders of integration and derivation are real numbers rather than natural ones . thereby , besides the conventional derivatives of order @xmath0 , one is able to evaluate derivatives of orders as arbitrary as @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "the fractional derivatives are non - commutative and non - associative in general . moreover , applied on a product of functions , they usually give rise to infinite series with derivatives and integrals of diverse non - integer orders ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although such properties seem ` counterintuitive ' , they find immediate application in describing systems with nonlocal properties of power - law type and are useful in different branches of physics and engineering ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "quite recently , the feynman path integral approach was extended to the fractional case @xcite , the main idea was to replace the involved brownian trajectories by lvy flights . as a consequence , a space - fractional version of the well known schrdinger equation",
    "has come to light @xcite . besides the cases of the quantum oscillator @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and the hydrogen - like potential @xcite , the space - fractional schrdinger equation has been solved for some piece - constant potentials @xcite , and has been extended to the time - fractional case @xcite .",
    "interesting discussions about the physical implementation of the quantum fractional oscillator can be found in @xcite .",
    "the physical realization of other fractional quantum systems is , as far as we know , an open problem .    with the present communication",
    "we extend the applicability of the factorization method @xcite to the case of fractional - differential hamiltonians . without loss of generality , we pay attention to the one - dimensional oscillator and show that the ` factorization energy ' , which is a constant in the conventional factorization , must be replaced by a fractional - differential operator in the extended fractional formulation .",
    "this last permits the application of algebraic methods to determine the energies and wave - functions of the quantum fractional oscillator .",
    "remarkably , it is found that the energy eigenvalues are expressed as power - laws of the momentum in terms of the non - integer differential order of the eigenvalue equation . as indicated above ,",
    "our method is not restricted to the oscillator - like interactions , it is also useful in solving the fractional eigenvalue problem of other one - dimensional potentials .",
    "for one - dimensional systems the time - independent , space - fractional schrdinger equation @xcite is of the form @xmath3\\psi(x)=e\\psi(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the lvy index ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 is the riesz fractional derivative of order @xmath4 , and @xmath7 is a scale constant . the conventional schrdinger equation is recovered if @xmath8 . from now on we use proper units such that @xmath9 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the fractional oscillator potential is defined as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 . here , for the sake of clarity",
    ", this parameter is fixed as @xmath12 .",
    "the arbitrariness of @xmath13 makes no substantial difference in the method and can be retrieved in a further step .",
    "therefore , the fractional - differential equation to be solved is given by @xmath14\\psi(x)=e\\psi(x ) , \\quad 1 < \\alpha \\leq 2 .",
    "\\label{es1}\\ ] ] as this will be clear in the sequel , it is useful to express ( [ es1 ] ) in momentum - representation @xmath15\\phi(k)=e\\phi(k ) .",
    "\\label{es2}\\ ] ]      we look for a pair of operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that @xmath18 where @xmath19 can be either a number ( as in the conventional factorization ) or a fractional - differential operator",
    ". the explicit form of the factors can be as general as in the conventional factorization whenever the identity ( [ factor1 ] ) is fulfilled . here",
    "we present just one of their simpler expressions .",
    "namely , @xmath20 give @xmath21 comparing ( [ factor2 ] ) with ( [ es1 ] ) we see that ( [ factor1 ] ) is fulfilled if @xmath22 that is , for @xmath23 , the factorization energy @xmath19 is a fractional - differential operator of order @xmath24 rather than a constant .",
    "notice that @xmath25 leads to the conventional result @xmath26 , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 the boson operators of the ( mathematical ) quantum oscillator @xmath29 .      to identify the kernel of @xmath16 we have to solve the fractional - differential equation @xmath30\\psi_{0}^{(\\alpha ) } ( x)=0 . \\label{ker1}\\ ] ] equivalently , one can solve this last equation in position - representation @xmath31\\phi_{0}^{(\\alpha ) } ( k)=0.\\ ] ] substituting the solution @xmath32 into ( [ es2 ] ) we obtain an expression for the related energy @xmath33 thus , the wave - function @xmath34 and energy @xmath35 have a power - law dependence on the momentum @xmath36 that is determined by the lvy index @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the solutions for the ground state @xmath37 of the ( mathematical ) quantum oscillator are recovered if @xmath25 .",
    "similar results have been reported for the ` cauchy oscillator ' by using the so called strang splitting method in @xcite . in our case ,",
    "( [ phi0 ] ) and ( [ e0 ] ) are just a consequence of the factorization ( [ factor1 ] ) . indeed , introducing ( [ ker1 ] ) in ( [ factor1 ] ) and using ( [ es1 ] ) , one obtains the equation @xmath38\\psi_0^{(\\alpha)}(x ) = 0.\\ ] ] in momentum - representation this last acquires the form @xmath39 \\phi_0^{(\\alpha ) } = 0 .",
    "\\label{ke0}\\ ] ] clearly , the function ( [ phi0 ] ) is solution of ( [ ke0 ] ) , so that our approach is self - consistent .",
    "1ex    the behaviour of the ( numerically calculated ) fourier transform @xmath40 of ( [ phi0 ] ) and the energy ( [ e0 ] ) are depicted in figure  [ ground](a ) and ( d ) for two different values of the lvy index",
    ". note that the variations of @xmath41 with respect to the parameter @xmath4 are almost negligible ( the power - law dependence on @xmath36 is in the argument of an exponential function ) .",
    "the situation for the energy eigenvalue @xmath35 is quite different because the power - law dependence on @xmath36 is in the denominator of ( [ e0 ] ) .    as in the conventional factorization , the proper application of the operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 give rise to the other solutions of the problem .",
    "for instance , to get the first excited state @xmath42 we apply @xmath17 on @xmath34 .",
    "after some calculations one gets @xmath43 and using ( [ es2 ] ) we arrive at the expression for the energy @xmath44 a similar procedure is used to construct the other excited sates . in particular , the second excited state @xmath45 belongs to the energy @xmath46\\ ] ] the behaviour of these solutions can be appreciated in figure  [ ground ] . in all cases",
    "the conventional results of the quantum oscillator are recovered if @xmath25 .",
    "note that the dependence of the wave - functions on the lvy index @xmath4 starts to be significative for the excited states .",
    "with some further modifications , the method can be immediately applied to solve the eigenvalue problem of the fractional potential @xmath10 , @xmath11 , discussed in @xcite . in such a case ,",
    "the solutions depend on the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath13 , and behave quite similar to the ones presented in this communication .",
    "noticeably , one can use more general fractional - differential operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with lvy indices @xmath49 and @xmath50 , such that the identity @xmath51 is true .",
    "this last includes the case in which @xmath25 from the very beginning .",
    "that is , the case in which we look for the fractional - factorization of the conventional hamiltonian in quantum mechanics .",
    "as expected , even in this last case , the fractional - factorization program gives rise to new algebraic properties of the factorizing operators @xcite .",
    "this last opens new possibilities for the trends in supersymmetric quantum mechanics as this last is based fundamentally in the factorization method .",
    "other possible applications of the fractional - factorization presented in this paper include the paraxial theory of optical beam propagation @xcite .",
    "further progress in these subjects will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we have introduced an algebraic technique to solve the eigenvalue problem of the laskin time - independent , space - fractional schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "this is based on a modification of the well known factorization method and requires that the factorization energy , which is a constant in the conventional factorization , be expressed as a differential operator of non - integer order .",
    "although we have specialized our discussion in the case of the ( mathematical ) oscillator potential @xmath52 , the generalities of the method can be glimpsed from the expressions derived in section  [ gral ] .",
    "thus , with the appropriate refinements , the fractional - factorization can be implemented in practically all the cases where the conventional factorization is known to work . of special interest",
    ", we have shown that the energies of the quantum fractional oscillator studied here depend on the momentum in terms of a power - law that is determined by the non - integer order of the fractional eigenvalue equation .",
    "some insights of such a behaviour can be obtained from the classical fractional version of the same potential for which a dissipative - like term is included in the motion equation @xcite .",
    "definitive conclusions on the matter are in progress ."
