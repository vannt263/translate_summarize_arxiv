    "deep near - ir imaging has an important role in the studies of very distant objects , whose redshift moves the rest frame visible light into the near - ir .",
    "in fact , from @xmath2 the wavelength range where normal stars emit most of their energy and have their prominent spectral features ( 4000 @xmath3 10000  ) is shifted in the near - ir , between 1 and 2.5 @xmath4 m .",
    "in addition , the stellar light of @xmath5 galaxies observed in the near - ir is less likely to be affected by extinction and by an active nuclear component ( i.e. a dust scattered agn ) than in the optical and is not contaminated by thermal dust emission",
    ". therefore the near - ir is of fundamental importance in order to investigate the stellar component of high redshift galaxies .",
    "this paper describes the results of ir imaging of sources selected from the _ westerbork  northern  sky  survey _",
    "( wenss , rengelink et al .",
    "@xcite ) , a new large - scale low - frequency radio survey that covers the whole sky for @xmath6 degree at 325 mhz , and about a quarter of this region at 609 mhz , to a limiting flux density of 18 and 15 mjy respectively .",
    "contrary to previous ir works concentrated mostly on powerful radio sources ( e.g. lilly & longair @xcite , rigler et al .",
    "@xcite , dunlop & peacock @xcite ) , the radio catalogue from which we selected our sources extends to low flux densities and therefore to galaxies with a much lower level of nuclear activity .",
    "the use of ir imaging allows one to address three important questions : first , the identification of the sources in these sub - samples with their optical / ir counterparts . at high redshift ( @xmath5 )",
    "the peak of the spectral energy distribution of galaxies is shifted in the near ir where their flux density is therefore larger than in the optical by orders of magnitude .",
    "so it is easier to identify sources , which correspond to distant galaxies , in the ir than in the optical .",
    "secondly , ir imaging allows the study of the ir `` alignment effect '' , i.e. the alignment of the ir morphology with the radio axis , as a function of the redshift and radio power . the alignment effect",
    "( see mccarthy @xcite for a review ) has been discovered in the optical , and demonstrates a strong influence of the agn on the optical morphology and luminosity . however , its origin is still matter of debate and its extension to the ir is important to understand it .",
    "dunlop and peacock ( @xcite ) have detected a clear ir alignment effect in a 3cr sample of radio galaxies in the redshift range @xmath7 ( they show the ir - radio and the optical - radio alignment histograms for this subset , claiming that the alignment effect is just as clear at @xmath1 as in the optical ) in contrast with the conclusions of rigler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for the same sub - sample of objects .",
    "therefore it is necessary to study the ir alignment in different samples to shed some light on the origin of this discrepancy ( probably , much of the apparent discrepancy arises from different methods of analysis ) and on the possible presence of different components which dominate in the ir and in the optical , respectively .",
    "finally , the ir observations enable the study of the stellar populations of distant galaxies through the analysis of the light emitted by normal stars , in order to determine , modelling their spectral energy distributions by means of stellar population synthesis models , the age of the oldest stars and therefore provide us with information about the epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "we emphasize that the starlight analysis is easier and more productive in the samples at lower radio power , as are the ones selected from the wenss survey , since the properties of the stellar populations are less contaminated by the agn component .    in the next paragraph",
    "we discuss the selection criteria of our samples",
    ". then we report on our observations and immediate results for individual sources .",
    "we then analyse the radio - ir alignment and discuss the results obtained for a gravitational lens system .",
    "our work is part of a large collaboration for optical and infrared studies of radio sources from the wenss catalogue . for this purpose ,",
    "three samples of the wenss catalogue have been defined :    1 .   ultra steep spectrum ( uss ) radio sources with a flux density @xmath8 mjy and a steep spectral index cut - off of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "optical and infrared follow - up work has been limited to the 95 per cent of this sample which has no identification on poss .",
    "these objects are powerful tracers of high redshift galaxies . 2 .",
    "gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio sources located in two regions of the survey : one at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which is called the _ mini - survey _ region ( rengelink et al .",
    "@xcite ) , centered on the north ecliptic pole , and the other at @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these sources have a spectral index cut - off of @xmath15 with a convex radio spectrum peaked at a frequency of about 1 ghz ( snellen et al .",
    "they are compact luminous objects , at intermediate and high redshift , which are interesting both as a special class of agn and as probes of galaxy evolution .",
    "flat spectrum ( fs ) radio sources with an initial selection from the greenbank surveys ( condon & broderick @xcite , gregory & condon @xcite ) at 5 ghz ( @xmath16 mjy ) .",
    "the coordinate limits are @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the spectral index cut - off @xmath19 .",
    "they are mostly quasars , up to the highest redshifts , along with a useful number of radio - faint bl lacs .",
    "the sub - samples of sources to be observed in the ir were defined from the above samples in the following way :    1 .",
    "uss sources : 1 .",
    "sub - sample a with @xmath20 and @xmath18 and spectral index @xmath21 . at the time of selection optical @xmath22-band images and spectra",
    "were already available .",
    "sub - sample b with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "for these objects we had also @xmath22-band images and vla maps .",
    "sub - sample c with @xmath25 .",
    "it is a high flux control sample supplied by richard saunders .",
    "it was selected to have a flux density larger than 0.9 jy at 365 mhz , to be about a factor 5 - 10 brighter in the radio than the sources in the rest of the sample .",
    "for these objects we had only vla maps . + given they overlap in right ascension range with the gps and fs sources , we observed in the ir only 9 out of the 69 objects in sub - sample a. on the other hand , we observed most objects of sub - sample b ( 20 out of 30 ) and all 7 objects of sub - sample c. 2 .",
    "gps sources in the _ mini - survey _ region further constrained to @xmath26 , with optical identification in the @xmath22-band .",
    "we have imaged in @xmath1-band all the 14 objects in this sub - sample .",
    "8 of them were also imaged in the @xmath0-band .",
    "no further selection was applied a priori on the fs sample .",
    "however given the available observing time , we imaged in @xmath1-band 13 out of the 67 sources in the fs sample .",
    "these were chosen to cover the full range of flux densities at 5 ghz in the sample and to contain a fair number ( 5 ) of sources not identified on deep ccd frames in the @xmath22-band .",
    "the observations were performed in two runs ( august and september 1995 ) , using the nordic optical telescope ( not ) at la palma , equipped with the arcetri near - infrared camera ( arnica , lisi et al .",
    "@xcite ) and they were part of the 1995 international time programme for the telescopes on the canary islands on optical / ir follow - up studies of wenss sources .",
    "arnica relies on a 256x256 hgcdte nicmos array and was used with a scale of 0.55 arcsec / pixel and a field of view of 2.35 arcmin .",
    "tables 1 , 2 , 3 list the observed sources for the uss , gps , and fs samples respectively . in the first columns of the tables we give some information from other authors on the optical identifications of the three samples .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath27lensing galaxy only    we would like to stress that the photometric information on the lensing galaxy which we extract from our data is based on the vla and hst astrometry and on the radio flux ratio for the two quasar images and is only partially affected by our relatively poor detector sampling .",
    "the stated accuracy in the lensing galaxy magnitude takes into account the uncertainty in the registration of the positions of the quasar images on the pixel grid .",
    "we presented the results of deep ir imaging for three sub - samples of radio sources of the wenss catalogue : 36 uss , 14 gps and 13 fs sources .",
    "we show images in the @xmath0- or @xmath1-bands of the identified objects : 29 uss sources , 13 gps sources and 10 fs sources .",
    "we have found ir counterparts for 44% of uss sources , 93% of gps sources and 77% of fs sources .",
    "in addition , there are uncertain ir counterparts for 36% of uss sources and 15% of fs sources . in some cases , we find the ir counterparts of radio sources still lacking optical identifications .",
    "we remark that for the uss sources we find a larger percentage of certain ir identifications for the a and b sub - samples than for the high flux control sub - sample c.      finally , we present the @xmath0-band image of the gravitational lens system 1600 + 434 , before and after subtraction of the quasar images . this procedure",
    "allow us to provide an estimate of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-magnitudes of the lensing galaxy ."
