    "one of the simplest way to experimentally modify the surfaces of zno is by heating it to elevated temperature ( but not exceeding its melting point ) .",
    "heating zno can be easily carried out in practice , and many works had been reported along this line @xcite .",
    "zno crystals are dominated by four low miller indices surfaces : the non - polar ( 1 0 @xmath4 0 ) and ( 1 1 @xmath5 0 ) surfaces and the polar surfaces which are comprised of zinc - terminated surface ( 0 0 0 1 ) and the oxygen terminated surface ( 0 0 0 @xmath4 ) .",
    "the polar surface of ionic crystals will have a surface energy that diverges with sample size due to the generation of a macroscopic electrostatic field across the crystal @xcite , or the cleavage energy is infinite in the ionic crystals .",

    "sublimation of atoms from the polar surfaces , driven by temperature effect , was studied using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation , where the trajectories of all atoms at a given temperature @xmath2 were followed quantitatively . in the md simulated annealing , in which the reactive force field ( reaxff ) for zno is used ,",
    "sublimation of o atoms from zno polar surface is observed .",
    "the occurrence of sublimation was attributed to the novelty of zno reaxff that allows for bond formation and charge transfer among the participating atoms .",

    "we observed that o atoms began to leave the ( 0 0 0 1 ) surface , mostly in pair , for simulation running with @xmath2 = 800  k or above .",
    "sublimation of the o atoms occurs only during the temperature plateau phase .",
    "no atom other than the o atoms on the ( 0 0 0 1 ) surface sublimates from the slab .",
    "in particular , no zn atom sublimates from either surfaces of zno . such observation tallies with the experimental measurement that only oxygen vacancies were created but not zn upon heating a zno sample ( see the related discussion in subsection  [ comparison ] ) .",

    "it was also observed that most of the sublimated o atoms will leave the ( 0 0 0 1 ) surface in pairs",
    ". a closer investigation of the simulated snapshots revealed that the two oxygen atoms forming a pair during sublimation were neighbors to each other before both left the surface .",
    "however we also observed a tiny portion of sublimated o atoms leaving the surface alone and did not form pairs .",
    "the formation of oxygen atom pairs during sublimation was made possible in the md simulation due to the novel capability of the reactive force field to allow bond formation between neighboring o atoms . from theoretical point of view , surface atoms are under very different conditions than that for the bulk atoms , give rise to the presence of dangling bonds in the former . as a result , the polar surface which consists of o atoms have higher tendency to form bond with a neighboring o atoms from the same surface layer . when sublimated , these dimers form oxygen pairs as observed in the md simulation .",
    "based on our md results , we conclude the following microscopic picture : dimers of o atoms will be formed on the wurtzite ( 0 0 0 1 ) zno surface when it is heated up .",

    "the origin of the broad pl secondary peak , i.e. green emission centered at 536 nm , remains a debatable issue .",
    "it could be interpreted as a reliable indicator of the abundance of point defect present on the surface or otherwise . in either case",
    ", it is reasonable to reckon that the intensity of the green emission is related to the presence of point defects .",
    "the only issue is the quantitative extent of the contribution of the point defect apart from other possible causes . in this paper",
    "we adopt the viewpoint that the intensity of the secondary pl peak is taken as a qualitative indicator of the abundance of point defect present on the surface . such a viewpoint is consistent with the other reports @xcite .",
    "ahn et al . had explained that the broad green peak centered at 536 nm is due to band transition from zinc interstitial ( zni ) to oxygen vacancy ( vo ) defect levels in zno @xcite .",
    "al . reported the band transition from zni to vo level is approximately 2.31 ev ( green emission ) based on the full potential linear muffin - tin orbital method @xcite .",
    "we shall interpret the pl data by making the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the larger the abundance of oxygen point defects on the surface the higher the intensity of the secondary peak ; 2 .",
    "the primary peak contribution to the oxygen vacancies on the surface is not to be considered in present analysis ( which is still qualitative )    fig .",
    "[ pl_vs_temperature ] shows the intensities of green luminescence ( gl ) at wavelength 512 nm of the zno-1 and zno-2 samples as a function of temperature .",
    "the zno samples at @xmath25  k , @xmath26 573 k , 673  k , 773  k and 873  k display a low intensity .",
    "there is a pronounced increase of gl luminescence at @xmath2 = 973  k and @xmath2 = 1073  k , with the intensity at the latter temperature higher than the former .",
    "when @xmath2 crosses 873  k to 973  k , both zno-1 and zno-2 samples ( with different morphologies ) display the same threshold effect of abrupt increase in the gl intensity .",
    "a temperature threshold effect is clearly being triggered between @xmath2 = 873  k and @xmath2 = 973  k , which is to be compared with @xmath27 800  k predicted by the md simulation .",
    "the predicted threshold temperature is based on idealized model in a md simulation that can not exactly describe what actually happened in a real experiment .",
    "since the parametrisation of the zno reaxff does not include sublimation of o atoms from zno surfaces , the value of @xmath19 from md falls so closely to the experimentally measured range of @xmath28 973  k is a very suggestive finding .",
    "if we accept an uncertainty of @xmath29  k in the threshold temperature , which is reasonably acceptable for a typical md calculation , then the following picture seems appropriate ( at least qualitatively ) : ( _ i _ ) oxygen point defects on the wurtzite zno ( 0 0 0 1 ) surface are created only at or above the threshold annealing temperature of @xmath19 , and ( _ ii _ ) the abundance of oxygen point defects on the surface increases as the annealing temperature @xmath2 increases ( where @xmath3 ) . apart from the pl data as reported above , the md simulation results are also consistent with a previous experiment @xcite which was conducted by two present authors ( c.a.l and s.m ) . in @xcite , two different zno nanostructures ( in wurtzite phase )",

    "it was found that the density of zn atom count is similar for both annealed and unannealed samples . however , the density of o atom count for the annealed sample has clearly decreased compared to the unannealed sample .",
    "the esi images are consistent with the notion that o atoms will be sublimated at a temperature @xmath32 , while zn atoms will not .",
    "although the zno samples were measured for only two temperatures ( one at ambient and the other at 973 k ) in @xcite , the data is ubiquitously consistent with the present md results .",

    "[ partialcharge_vs_z1300 ] ) displays an oscillation pattern .",
    "the oscillation is due to the fact that the sign of partial charges from the same atom type at a common layer is opposite to that of adjacent layers occupied by the other atom type . in our md simulations",

    "<S> we have also simulated the annealing on the ( 1 0 0 0 ) and ( @xmath0 0 0 0 ) surfaces but found no robust sign of sublimation . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal behavior of a zno slab revealed by our md simulation based on the reaxff is consistent with experimental observations .    </S>",
