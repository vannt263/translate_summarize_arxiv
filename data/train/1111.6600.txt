    "<S> it has been realized that topological superconductors provide one of the conceptually simplest platforms for the solid state realization of mfs . </S>",
    "<S> more recently it was shown that topological superconductors with mfs can occur fairly generically in systems containing the three ingredients of conventional @xmath0-wave superconductivity , time - reversal breaking ( _ e.g. _ via a magnetic field ) , and spin - orbit coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a simple topological superconducting ( ts ) system supporting mfs , which has attracted serious experimental attention @xcite , consists of a semiconductor nanowire in a magnetic field placed on an ordinary superconductor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-wave proximity effect on a inas quantum wire , which also has a sizable so coupling , has already been realized in experiments @xcite , and the search for the corresponding ts phase , in the presence of a magnetic field , with localized majorana modes in semiconductors is actively being pursued in many laboratories worldwide . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical demonstration  @xcite that such 1d systems can show non - abelian statistics has made these systems viable components for quantum information processing .    </S>",
    "<S> while the proposal for the realization of mfs in semiconductor structures has generated considerable theoretical interest and even inspired significant experimental efforts @xcite , a few key challenges relating to non - idealities in realistic systems remain . </S>",
    "<S> one such practical challenge is whether it is possible to control the chemical potential of a semiconductor wire , which is absolutely essential to tune the system into the ts phase , since it is in contact with a superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the other key challenge arises from the fact that the ts gap is typically suppressed by strong disorder @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the present proposals for realizing mfs would either require clean semiconductor systems or a spin - orbit coupling which is large enough to dominate over the disorder scattering effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is completely unclear at this stage whether these key obstacles of chemical potential tuning and low disorder can be overcome in the currently studied semiconductor nanowire structures unless substantial materials development occurs first . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal in this paper overcomes both of these problems completely in one stroke by coming up with a new architecture ( i.e. topology ) for creating the majorana additionally , our proposal involves using semiconductor quantum dots coupled to superconducting grains which is in many ways a simpler system to work with than the earlier two - dimensional @xcite or one - dimensional structures @xcite for observing the ts phase . </S>",

    "<S> this level structure is qualitatively independent of local disorder potential . ]    in this paper we describe a new system composed of a linear quantum - dot(qd)/superconductor ( sc ) array ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ) to realize non - abelian majorana fermion modes at the ends of the array . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of disorder in the qd / sc array are suppressed in a transparent way because the topological state can be formed as long as the electron can hop from one qd to a neighboring qd in the array , which is a much easier condition to satisfy than the near ballistic transport condition necessary through a wire . </S>",
    "<S> strong disorder can typically renormalize the hopping across qd or sc islands , however as long as the disorder energy scale is less than the fermi energy , one can choose the qd / sc to be shorter than the localization length to enable significant transmission probability . </S>",
    "<S> the confinement potential of the qd separates the electronic energy levels in the dots as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , the chemical potential can be adjusted by using gate voltages ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ) so that only a single level in each qd participates in transport through the qd / sc array structure . as in the ts phase of other @xcite superconductor - semiconductor structures , spin - orbit coupling plays a crucial role in determining the superconducting gap in the ts phase . because the single levels in each qd are spin - polarized almost in the same direction , spin - orbit coupling is necessary to lead to a rotation of the spin - polarization between the left and right end of the qd ( as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) ) so as to allow a proximity - induced sc coupling between neighboring qds . </S>",
    "<S> note that the on - site proximity - induced sc coupling in the same qd is forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , coulomb charging effects can be ignored in the qd since we are operating in the parameter regime containing a single active level per qd . </S>",
    "<S> we mention that the number of electrons per dot ( they could be as few as a few 10s ) , whether the dots are identical or not , whether hopping through the whole linear array is coherent or not , how many dots there are in the system ( as few as 5 - 10 should work ) are all non - issues for the realization of the ts phase ( as we have explicitly verified numerically) the only constraints are that there should be only one electron at the chemical potential in each dot ( which can be secured by adjusting the local gates individually on each dot ) and there should be enough hopping to ensure local proximity effect .    </S>",
    "<S> while for perfectly periodic qd / sc arrays , the condition for realizing a ts systems is given by whether there are an odd number of partially filled levels in each qd , one must understand the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian of the qd / sc array more generally to understand the condition for the emergence of mfs in the disordered qd / sc array . in the limit of weak ( compared to level spacing in the qd ) qd / sc tunneling , </S>",

    "<S> , the magnitudes of @xmath15 can be controlled to a certain degree by controlling the qd / sc tunneling . however , the magnitude of @xmath16 or the signs of @xmath21 are more difficult to control given the disorder in the sc islands and the short fermi wave - vectors of electrons in the sc islands . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , such a strongly disordered kitaev chain is expected to have a large number of low - energy states , similar to a disordered topological superconductor , hindering the observation of non - abelian statistics and consequently topological quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that these low - energy states can be eliminated by shifting the phase of the superconducting order parameters on a sub - set of the sc islands by @xmath22 . by applying the appropriate phase shifts </S>",
    "<S> a robust ts phase with end mfs and a bulk gap of order @xmath23 with mfs at the ends can be obtained in the disordered 1d qd / sc array whenever the conditions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are satisfied . more generally , we show in the appendix that localized mfs are obtained whenever the localization length of an effective hamiltonian is longer than the superconducting coherence length . since @xmath16 and @xmath15 are of the same order this turns out to be easy to satisfy as demonstrated by the exact diagonalization of large number of short kitaev chains . </S>",

    "<S> the use of sc grains can potentially introduce random @xmath22 junctions in the chain , which can produce sub - gap states . </S>",
    "<S> these effects of strong disorder are avoided by adding an array of gates and removing accidental @xmath22 junctions by phase shifting the superconductors . in addition , the chemical potential in each dot is tuned individually with gates , thus completely eliminating any gating problem of the semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> finally , structures similar to the qd / sc array being proposed in this work are already in use in various conventional quantum computing architectures such as quantum dot spin qubits and superconducting cooper pair box qubits , thus making this a relatively practical ( as well as extremely robust ) proposal for creating non - abelian modes in the laboratory .    </S>",
