    "field emission tips are extremely high brightness emitters @xcite with large transverse coherence length @xcite and small energy spread @xcite .",

    "@xcite femtosecond field emission sources are being developed by triggering electron emission with ultrafast laser pulses .",
    "@xcite these sources have extremely small emission areas in comparison with existing ultrafast electron sources@xcite based on flat photocathodes and should therefore lead to better resolution for diffraction and imaging .",
    "furthermore , the small source size leads to the high transverse coherence required for electron interferometry and holography .",
    "@xcite ultrafast laser - triggered tips promise to extend the full range of electron microscopy imaging techniques to the femtosecond time - scale , creating tools for the study of chemical and physical transformations of materials with atomic - scale resolution .",
    "a number of areas have already benefited from laser - triggered emission from sharp tips .",
    "optical field enhancement at the tip apex has allowed exploration of strong field physics in solid state systems without the need for laser amplifiers .",
    "@xcite due to the extreme sensitivity of current to the light intensity at the emission site , field emission tips have been used to study the temporal dynamics of the optical near - field induced by the tip itself @xcite and map optical fields in nearby nano - structures @xcite with nanometric spatial resolution .",
    "ultrafast laser - triggered emission has also been used as a source of electron pulses for experiments that verified the dispersion - less nature of the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite and is being developed as an electron source for ultrafast scanning electron microscopy .",
    "@xcite these sources could also enable laser - based electron accelerators @xcite and a table - top ultrafast x - ray microfocus source .",
    "hafnium carbide ( hfc ) is an attractive material to use for ultrafast laser - induced electron emission because of its low work function ( @xmath0  ev ) , which makes it easier to liberate electrons , and its good mechanical stability at high temperatures .",
    "@xcite the low work function relaxes laser intensity requirements for electron emission , which would allow devices that use low power fiber lasers to excite the electrons or devices where electron optics elements near the tip preclude high numerical aperture focusing of the laser . here , we confirm this by showing that to generate one electron per pulse ( an important regime for avoiding space charge while maintaining the maximum possible flux ) hfc requires one quarter of the pulse energy as results reported in tungsten @xcite and gold .",
    "@xcite hfc has been demonstrated to have higher emission current densities than tungsten in stable dc operation , @xcite and it may be annealed more aggressively than tungsten to create clean surfaces .",
    "the low thermal conductivity of hfc is , however , a disadvantage if higher repetition frequencies or greater numbers of electrons per pulse are desired ; it results in higher average temperatures and longer - lasting elevated temperature transients for pulsed laser heating in comparison with materials like gold or tungsten .",
    "several ultrafast laser - induced electron emission processes have been observed in field emission tips , and these in general transfer the precise timing of the laser pulses to the electrons . in the perturbative regime ,",
    "photo - assisted field emission @xcite and multi - photon emission @xcite are prompt with respect to the laser intensity envelope .",
    "work in tungsten @xcite and gold @xcite has explored higher pulse fluences , where for sufficiently short optical pulses the emission profile is predicted to have sub - optical cycle features .",
    "@xcite    here , we show that laser - induced electron emission from hfc is due to two - photon emission over a broad range of laser power and bias field , yielding up to several electrons per pulse at 150  mhz .",
    "however , for certain parameters we observe thermally - enhanced field emission ( tfe ) , which we describe as a transient current pulse ( transient tfe ) superimposed on a steady - state background ( dc tfe ) .",
    "dc tfe arises from a significantly elevated average apex temperature due to the low thermal conductivity of hfc and the laser s high repetition rate .",
    "a transient tfe pulse could arise from rapid heating of the electrons by each laser pulse , followed by electron - phonon coupling on a ps timescale and cooling by conduction .",
    "the sub - ns timescale of conduction following laser - induced heating is known to play a role in ultrafast laser - assisted field evaporation , @xcite which is used for atom - probe tomography . however , until now there have been no investigations of the effects of a laser - induced elevated electron temperature on the timing properties of electron emission from fs - laser - triggered tips . by comparing the scaling of dc and transient tfe with that of multiphoton emission , we show that over the parameter range of our experiment , the transient effect is not a dominant source of current .",

    "for @xmath86-polarization in hfc , the heat is primarily deposited slightly away from the apex ( see fig . [ modeldetails](d ) ) , so that , without electron - phonon coupling , the apex temperature continues to rise after the optical pulse due to thermal conduction .",
    "third , for gold and tungsten , the apex cools via diffusion much more rapidly than hfc in the absence of electron - phonon coupling .",
    "this is due to both the higher electronic thermal conductivities of these two materials and the fact that the heating is initially more narrowly confined ( smaller optical skin depth ) . in gold , because the mean free path of the excited electrons is larger than the optical skin depth , ballistic transport would reduce the apex temperature even further.@xcite      the fractional contribution of transient tfe to the pulsed current ( measured by @xmath11 ) , as well as its scaling with laser power , should be compared with that of multi - photon emission in order to understand the regimes in which the tip can be operated as a fs - timescale emitter .",
    "we note that the field dependence of @xmath11 ( figs .",
    "[ figure : tfe1 ] , [ tfe2 ] ) is accurately fit by two - photon emission using eq .",
    "[ mpeq2 ] throughout the parameter regime accessible in our experiment ( limited to @xmath117  mw , above which the degree of dc tfe induced by small mis - alignments of the beam is much larger than the pulsed current ) .",

    "this requires an estimate of the field dependence of the transient tfe , as follows : first , the measured dc thermal emission at room temperature is used to calibrate the family of tfe curves @xmath41 for this particular data set , as in fig .",
    "[ figure : tfe1](b ) .",
    "next , a conservative upper limit to the transient tfe as a function of bias field is estimated as a square current pulse lasting for a time @xmath61 , due to the peak electron temperature before coupling with the phonons . therefore , the upper limit to transient tfe is @xmath121 , where average current has been used for comparison with experimental @xmath35-@xmath36 data .",

    "the @xmath1530-fold increase in two - photon emission was directly measured , as in fig .",

    "explicitly , fig .",
    "[ figure : trans_bound](b ) shows @xmath134 as a function of pulse fluence , for two values of bias field .",
    "we find that transient tfe is negligible over a wide range of pulse fluences , though it may become important as the power increases to the intermediate regime ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "scaling of two - photon emission is expected to give way to a higher order nonlinearity , so that emission might again be dominated by prompt processes . on the other hand , the extremely elevated transient electron temperatures that would be obtained ( @xmath136  k ) would lead to lattice temperatures above the melting point of the tip , as well as deviations from the thermally - enhanced field emission model used here , which approximates the electronic density of states as that of a free - electron metal . ]",
    "we have measured two - photon emission from a hafnium carbide tip induced by sub-10  fs laser pulses . hfc s low work function and demonstrated stability for high current density emission make it an excellent candidate tip material for ultrafast laser - triggered electron emission applications , particularly those with constraints on available peak laser intensity . at a repetition rate of 150  mhz , the maximum current achieved is 5 electrons per pulse , limited by the onset of thermally - enhanced field emission due to an increase in the average temperature of the tip .",
    "we estimate that for light polarized parallel to the axis of the tip under the conditions studied , transient tfe contributes negligibly to the total current .",
    "we present a simple framework for understanding the relative scaling of multiphoton emission and thermally - enhanced field emission with changing laser parameters and bias field .",
    "there are two complementary regimes for time - resolved pump probe measurements involving electrons .",
    "one end of the spectrum uses large numbers of electrons in a pulse in order to achieve single - shot measurements . at the opposite extreme ,",
    "space - charge broadening may be completely eliminated by operating in a single - electron - per - pulse regime , with high repetition rates to reduce acquisition time . both of these regimes may be affected by the thermal effects studied here , at least in principle : at high repetition rates , the dc temperature rise of the tip can result in significant dc tfe , while at very high pulse fluence",
    ", one should consider the possibility of large temperature rises for @xmath137 and accompanying transient tfe .",
    "the transient effect is more insidious since the resulting picosecond - timescale pulse would still be below the time resolution of standard electronic detection .",
