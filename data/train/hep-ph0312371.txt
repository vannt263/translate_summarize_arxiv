    ", @xmath16 increases as @xmath17 decreases , so that the total condensate @xmath271 is a smoothly varying function of @xmath3 .",
    "the understanding based on the approximate symmetry between the chiral and pion condensates is thus valid .",
    "an interesting observation is that @xmath16 , although it is a continuous function of @xmath3 , has a cusp shape associated with the phase transition of the pion condensate .",
    "finally let us compare the results for @xmath19 and those for @xmath269 in fig .",
    "[ fig : condensates ] .",
    "looking at the two figures at the same @xmath3 or @xmath5 , we find that the pion condensate @xmath17 for @xmath19 and the total condensate @xmath271 for @xmath269 have almost the same behavior .",
    "this indicates that , although the current quark mass suppresses @xmath17 , the price to pay is an increase in @xmath16 , so as to make the total condensate insensitive to the presence of small @xmath7 .",

    "the phase transition is of second order on these critical lines .",
    "the chiral condensate @xmath16 is everywhere zero for @xmath19 , while it is everywhere finite for @xmath282 . in the latter case",

    "[ fig : pd_isospin-3d ] .",
    "the pion condensate has a nonvanishing value inside the critical surface and the phase transition is of second order everywhere on this critical surface .",
    "the second order phase transition is consistent with other analyses employing the mean field approximation @xcite . on the other hand , monte carlo simulations of qcd with finite @xmath5 @xcite",
    "show an indication of the presence of a tricritical point in the @xmath3-@xmath5 plane at which the property of the phase transition line changes from second order to first order as @xmath5 increases . clarifying what induces such",
    "a first order phase transition is an interesting open problem .    the plane at @xmath121 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_isospin-3d ] shows the phase diagram in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "the lower left of the plane corresponds to the vacuum with no isospin density present , @xmath283 . on the other hand",
    ", the upper right of the plane corresponds to the saturated system , @xmath274 , in which every lattice site is occupied by three pions .",
    "there is a pion condensation phase ( a superfluid phase of isospin charge ) with @xmath281 and @xmath284 bounded by the above two limiting cases .",
    "they are separated by the two critical lines given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : threshold ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that we can see the corresponding system in the context of condensed matter physics ; the hard - core boson hubbard model has a similar phase diagram in which a superfluid phase is sandwiched by mott - insulating phases with zero or full density @xcite .",
    "here we can give a physical explanation for the saturation effect , that is , why the saturated isospin density forces the pion condensate to disappear .",
    "suppose that one imposes a small external field for the isospin charge on the system in which every lattice site is occupied maximally by pions .",
    "however , a pion at one site can not hop to the next site , owing to the pauli principle of constituent quarks , and thus the isospin current never appears .",
    "this results in a zero condensate because the superfluid current is proportional to the square of the absolute value of the condensate .",
    "this is nothing but an analogous phenomenon to the mott insulator .",
    "the fact that @xmath11 qcd at finite isospin density has the same phase structure as that of @xmath12 qcd at finite baryon density can be understood from the aspect of the symmetry and its breaking pattern .",
    "@xmath11 qcd at @xmath188 and @xmath19 has chiral symmetry between the chiral condensate and the pion condensate .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath12 qcd at @xmath10 and @xmath19 has pauli - grsey symmetry between the chiral condensate and the diquark condensate . in both theories ,",
    "the introduction of @xmath7 breaks the symmetries so that the chiral condensate is favored , and the introduction of @xmath5/@xmath4 breaks the symmetries so that the pion / diquark condensate is favored .",
    "this is the reason why these two theories have similar phase structures at finite density .",
    "in this paper , we studied the phase structure of hot and dense qcd with @xmath25 and @xmath285 in the strong coupling limit , formulated on a lattice .",
    "we employed the @xmath56 expansion ( only in the spatial direction ) and the mean field approximation to derive the free energy written in terms of the chiral condensate @xmath16 and the pion condensate @xmath17 at finite temperature @xmath3 , baryon chemical potential @xmath4 , isospin chemical potential @xmath5 and quark mass @xmath7 .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : baryon ] , we investigated the phase structure with @xmath15 in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane , and the phase transition of chiral restoration was found to be of second order in the high temperature region and of first order in the low temperature region .",
    "analytical formulas for the critical line of the second order transition and the position of the tricritical point were derived .",
    "the critical temperature at small quark chemical potential @xmath156 can be expanded as @xmath286 , and the slope was found to be much larger than that calculated in monte carlo lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "we discussed how this difference could be understood as a result of the strong coupling limit @xmath158 and the chiral limit @xmath19 .",
    "we also studied the effect of finite quark mass on the phase diagram : the position of the critical end point has a relatively large dependence on the quark mass . in paticular for small @xmath7 , the critical end point shifts in the direction of smaller @xmath3 and smaller @xmath4",
    "this is because the gradient of the phase transition line near the tricritical point is positive ; how this feature in the phase diagram of qcd is affected by the introduction of dynamical baryons beyond the leading order of the @xmath56 expansion should be studied in future work .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : isospin ] , we derived the free energy including @xmath5 by extending the formulation studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : baryon ] with two species of staggered fermion ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "first , we observed that the critical temperature of chiral restoration decreases on increasing the number of quark flavors due to the thermal excitations of mesons .",
    "then we studied the effect of @xmath5 on the phase diagram in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane at finite quark mass : the introduction of @xmath5 splits and shifts the first order phase transition line in opposite directions of @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , @xmath5 moves the two critical end points to higher temperatures than that for @xmath188 .",
    "this is a nontrivial effect originating from integration over the temporal gauge link variable at finite temperature , which couples the up and down quark sectors .    finally , we studied the phase structure in the space of @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 and found a formal correspondence between color @xmath11 qcd with finite isospin density and color @xmath12 qcd with finite baryon density .",
    "such a correspondence can be understood by considering the symmetry and its breaking pattern : chiral ( pauli - grsey ) symmetry at @xmath19 and @xmath188 ( @xmath10 ) is broken by the quark mass in the direction of chiral condensation , while it is broken by the isospin ( baryon ) chemical potential in the direction of pion ( diquark ) condensation .",
    "although our results are in principle limited to strong coupling , the behavior of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath273 in the @xmath3-@xmath5-@xmath7 space has qualitative agreement with recent lattice data .",
    "we also found that the disappearance of pion condensation with saturated density can be understood as a mott - insulating phenomenon .",
    "the remaining work to be explored is to investigate the phase structure with finite @xmath4 and finite @xmath5 as well as with @xmath3 and @xmath7 , where a nontrivial competition between the chiral and pion condensates takes place . in our formulation ,",
    "such a study is possible by using the effective free energy given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : free_energy - iso ] ) with numerical summation over the matsubara frequency and numerical integration over the temporal gauge link variable . how the chiral condensate at finite @xmath4 is replaced by the pion condensate as @xmath5 increases",
    "is one of the most interesting problem to be examined .",
    "the author is grateful to t.  hatsuda , k.  fukushima and s.  sasaki for continuous and stimulating discussions on this work and related subjects .",
    "he also thanks s.  hands for discussions on the parity transformation of staggered fermions .",
    "in this appendix , we give the formula for the product over the matsubara frequencies of the expression @xmath287   = \\prod_{n=1}^{n_\\tau}\\left[\\sin^2\\bar k_n+\\lambda^2\\right]^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath288 and @xmath289 an even integer .",
    "let us first take the logarithm of the above expression and differentiate it with respect to @xmath290 : @xmath291 because @xmath292 is invariant under the shift @xmath293 , we can make the summation of @xmath84 over the range @xmath294 to @xmath295 with an appropriate degeneracy factor @xmath296 .",
