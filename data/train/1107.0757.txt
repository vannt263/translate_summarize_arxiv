    "understanding how galaxies were formed and have evolved remains one of the basic problems to be solved in astrophysics . in this context , extragalactic globular clusters ( gcs )",
    "play an important role because their formation is associated with the physical processes occurring before galaxies were entirely assembled ( see brodie & strader 2006 for a review ) .",
    "it has been recognised for some time that massive galaxies have bimodal gc colour distributions ( ashman & zepf 1993 ) .",
    "this suggests two modes , or phases , of gc formation .",
    "indeed , several models have been proposed to explain the different modes in terms of variations in the epoch of gc formation , stellar population properties and the timescale of galaxy assembly ( ashman & zepf 1992 ; zepf & ashman 1993 ; forbes et al .",
    "1997 ; cote et al . 1998 ; beasley et al .",
    "as most gcs appear to be very old ( see review by brodie & strader 2006 ) , the bimodality in colour is normally assumed to translate directly into a bimodality in metallicity . however , doubt has recently been cast on this interpretation by some ( e.g. yoon et al .",
    "( 2006 ; blakeslee , cantiello & peng 2010 ) .",
    "depending on the degree to which the transformation of colour into metallicity is non - linear , it is possible for an instrinsically unimodal metallicity distribution to appear bimodal in colour space .",
    "if correct , this would have direct implications for the observed blue tilt ( a trend for redder colours with higher luminosities in the blue gc subpopulation ) and the correlation of the mean gc colour with galaxy luminosity .",
    "it would also radically change current ideas for two modes of gc formation .    as noted by blakeslee et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , _ `` very little is actually known about the detailed metallicity distributions of gcs in giant ellipticals.''_. two giant ellipticals with optical spectroscopic metallicities derived for their gc systems include m49 with 47 measurements ( strader et al .",
    "2007 ) and ngc 5128 with over 200 gc spectroscopic metallicities ( beasley et al . 2008 ) . in both cases",
    "the distribution of gc spectroscopic metallicities are bimodal .",
    "the gc systems of these galaxies also have bimodal optical colour distributions , as do most but not all galaxies ( see e.g. foster et al . 2010 ) .",
    "interestingly , the infrared study of gcs in ngc 5128 by spitler et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , which is more sensitive to metallicity than optical colours , also revealed colour bimodality in the 146 gcs they studied .",
    "along similar lines , kundu & zepf ( 2007 ) used optical - infrared colours of 80 gcs in m87 to show their distribution was bimodal .",
    "thus these giant ellipticals with optical spectra and/or infrared colours of gcs show metallicity bimodality .",
    "recently attempts have been made to derive spectroscopic metallicities using the infrared calcium triplet ( cat ) lines ( at 8498 , 8542 , and 8662 @xmath2 ) for the gc systems of two giant ellipticals ( foster et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) . in the case of ngc 1407 ,",
    "the cat metallicity distribution of 144 gcs is better described as unimodal , whereas cenarro et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested that the distribution was bimodal based on metallicities from optical wavelength spectra of just 20 gcs . for ngc 4494",
    ", the cat metallicity distribution again appears unimodal .",
    "unfortunately , there is no published work based on optical wavelength metallicities for the gc system in this galaxy .",
    "clearly a large sample study of gc metallicities derived from both blue and infrared absorption lines is needed to resolve these issues ( see foster et al .",
    "2010 for a complete discussion of potential factors affecting the cat derived metallicities ) . in summary",
    ", it appears that at least _ some _ elliptical galaxies reveal the presence of two metallicity subpopulations in their gc systems but the number of systems studied remains small .    for late - type spiral galaxies , only two are well - studied ( i.e. the milky way and m31 ) and both reveal bimodal spectroscopic metallicity distributions for their gc systems ( e.g. zinn 1985 ; barmby et al",
    ". 2000 but see also caldwell et al .",
    "no early - type spirals have published spectra for large numbers of gcs .",
    "the nearest spiral galaxy with a large gc system is the sombrero galaxy ( m104 , ngc 4594 ) , which lies a distance of 9.0 @xmath3 0.1 mpc ( see table 4 of spitler et al .",
    "2006 for a summary ) .",
    "although classified as an edge - on sa galaxy , it has a bulge - to - total ratio of 0.8 ( kent 1988 ) and hence might be better described as a massive bulge plus an extended disk .",
    "this galaxy hosts some 1900 gcs that extend to a projected radius of 50 kpc ( rhode & zepf 2004 ; spitler et al .",
    "2006 ) and one ultra compact dwarf ( hau et al . 2009 ) .",
    "a number of previous studies have obtained spectra of sombrero gcs ( bridges et al . 1997 ; larsen et al .",
    "2002 ; held et al . 2003 ; bridges et al .",
    "2007 ) , however the number of spectra of sufficient signal - to - noise ( s / n ) to measure individual gc metallicities was very limited .",
    "the keck spectra of larsen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) confirmed that the dozen luminous gcs they studied were all old .",
    "in this paper we present keck integrated spectra for over 200 globular clusters in m104 .",
    "this is the largest sample of gcs in the sombrero galaxy homogeneously analysed to date .",
    "our main goal is to obtain radial velocities to confirm association with the sombrero galaxy and to obtain spectroscopic metallicities .",
    "a future paper will investigate the kinematic properties of the gc system .",
    "gc candidates were selected from two published photometric studies . in the inner regions we used the @xmath4 hst / acs mosaic of spitler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which covers approximately the central 10@xmath5 7  of the galaxy with minimal contamination . beyond this area",
    ", we used the ground - based @xmath4 catalogue of rhode & zepf ( 2004 ) .",
    "this latter catalogue has higher contamination but extends to the apparent edge of the gc system at a projected radius of 19  and so is necessary to complement the wide field - of - view ( 16@xmath5 5 ) of the deimos spectrograph .",
    "the central dust lane of ngc 4594 was excluded from our target selection .",
    "target selection was made using both magnitude and colour .",
    "the colour selection using the @xmath4 filters was performed using previously published gcs as a guide ( bridges et al .",
    "1997 ; larsen et al . 2002 ; held et al . 2003 ; bridges et al .",
    "four masks were designed , with a total of 404 gc candidates .",
    "the median candidate had @xmath6 with both colour subpopulations well - represented .",
    "the masks included candidates with a wide radial range ( extending to @xmath7 ) and a moderate range in position angle , with the ne and sw quadrants of the galaxy well - covered .",
    "all four masks were observed during a single run from 2006 april 2629 .",
    "total exposure times for each mask ranged from 34.5 hr , divided into individual exposures of 30 min .",
    "all spectroscopic observations were made with the 900 l / mm grating , blazed at 5500  .",
    "slits were milled to a width of 1.0 , yielding a resolution of 2.1    ( fwhm ) .",
    "seeing was variable during the run , ranging from 0.61.1 .",
    "the deimos data were reduced using the deep2 spec2d package , adapted for our instrument setup .",
    "the nominal spectral coverage for an object in the center of the mask was @xmath86900 @xmath9 , but the throughput toward the blue was low , so the useful spectral range was somewhat smaller .",
    "the wavelength scales were calibrated using arc spectra and fitting a 4th degree polynomial to the wavelength solution .",
    "the spectra were divided into two regions (  blue `` and ' ' red \" ) and the wavelength solutions calculated separately , with an rms scatter of 0.08 @xmath9   in the blue and 0.06 @xmath9   in the red , corresponding to roughly 5 and 3 kms@xmath10 respectively .",

    "heliocentric radial velocities were obtained using the iraf task fxcor .",
    "fxcor performs fourier cross - correlation of input object spectra against a specified template spectrum . for the cross - correlation of the deimos spectra we used the spectrum of the k giant star arcturus as the template .",
    "we were able to measure radial velocities for 258 gc candidates .",

    "the uncertainties quoted are derived from the width of the cross - correlation peak , normalized using the distribution of the differences between the blue and red velocities as a function of magnitude , with a minimum value of 8 kms@xmath10 .",
    "these uncertainties primarily reflect the random component of the error ; we estimate our systematic error , due primarily to zero - point uncertainties , to be @xmath12 20 kms@xmath10 .    to obtain the galactocentric coordinates ( x , y ) and projected distances for our sample we adopted a distance to sombrero of 9.0  mpc ( spitler et  al .",
    "2006 ) . at this distance",
    ", 1 arcmin corresponds to @xmath1 2.62 kpc .",
    "we used a central position of @xmath13 = 12@xmath1439@xmath1599@xmath16.43 , @xmath17 = @xmath1811@xmath193723  . the position angle for the x - coordinate",
    "is taken as 90@xmath19 ( e.g. , de vaucouleurs et al .",

    "figure [ f : vrmag ] shows the radial velocities as a function of v magnitude , @xmath21 colour , and the radial velocity distribution for the 258 gc candidates .",
    "the mean velocity of the gc candidate sample is v@xmath22 = 1075 @xmath3 359 kms@xmath10 .",
    "this is similar to the systemic velocity of sombrero itself ( 1024 kms@xmath10 ; smith et al",
    "furthermore , the radial velocity distribution for the bulk of the objects is roughly gaussian , which is expected for a bound gc system .",
    "thus we can conclude that the bulk of the objects with measured velocities are probable members of the sombrero gc system .",
    "the tail of objects with very low and high radial velocities in this figure are likely foreground stars and background galaxies respectively .",
    "given the clear gap between the bulk of the objects and those with high velocities , we have chosen to restrict our sample to v@xmath23 @xmath0 2000 kms@xmath10 ( the highest measured velocity , at @xmath24 kms@xmath10 , is likely spurious ) .",
    "we note that the gc candidates show no obvious trend of velocity with either magnitude or colour .",
    "figure [ f : vrgal ] displays the radial velocities versus the projected galactocentric distance for gc candidates .",
    "the bulk of objects have velocities around 1100 kms@xmath10 irrespective of galactocentric distance , although the dispersion decreases with radius .",
    "such behaviour is similar to that seen by bridges et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in their study of the sombrero gc system .",
    "we exclude a further 14 objects with low velocities that lie at large projected distances ( these are likely to be foreground stars ) .",
    "there are also five objects at large distances with somewhat higher velocities than the spread in velocities at that radius .",
    "these objects may be gcs with anomalous velocities . for the purposes of this spectroscopic metallicity analysis we adopt a conservative approach and exclude them from selection . for a kinematic analysis , in which outliers can have a large effect on results",
    ", a more sophisticated selection process will be required .    to quantify the velocity dispersion we binned our sample into three different radii ( 0 @xmath0 r@xmath25 @xmath26 10 kpc , 10 @xmath0 r@xmath25 @xmath26 20 kpc and r@xmath25 @xmath27 20 kpc ) , which was a purely arbitrary choice .",
    "we measure @xmath28 = 249 km@xmath29 in the first bin , @xmath28 = 183 km@xmath29 in the second , and @xmath28 = 131 km@xmath29 in the third one .",
    "the excluded objects lie at least 2@xmath20 away from the mean velocity in each bin . after excluding the probable foreground stars , background galaxies and high velocity objects we have a sample of 239 velocity confirmed gcs associated with the sombrero galaxy .",
    "we have reliable radial velocities for 37 gcs with previously published data .",
    "we compare our new velocities to those from the literature in fig .",
    "[ f : vel_lit ] , in which the different studies are coded by symbol type .",
    "nearly all of the repeats are from the 2df and wht studies of bridges et al .",
    "( 1997 ; 2007 ) . there is no evidence for a zeropoint offset in the velocity scales , with median differences ( in the stated sense of new@xmath18old ) of @xmath30 and @xmath31 kms@xmath10 for the two studies respectively .",
    "in addition , the distribution of velocities differences generally seems consistent with that expected from the stated uncertainties , excepting a small number of outliers .",
    "the radial velocities from larsen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are systematically higher than ours ( @xmath32 in the median ) , but with only four gcs in common , this conclusion is not strong .          in order to derive spectroscopic metallicities for our moderate resolution and moderate signal - to - noise ( see fig .",
    "1 ) data we adopt a similar approach to that of perrett et al . ( 2002 ) and brodie & huchra ( 1990 ) who studied the gcs of m31 .",
    "aiming to measure the metallicities of extragalactic gcs , brodie & huchra ( 1990 , hereafter bh90 ) defined a set of calibrations based upon six different absorption - line indices , which were strongly sensitive to metallicity .",
    "their metallicity calibrations were tied to the milky way gc system and therefore the assumption that the gcs are mostly old ( i.e. @xmath33 10 gyr ) .",
    "originally , bh90 measured the metallicity of globular clusters by taking the weighted mean of the six elemental absorption - line indices , which lead to estimated metallicities with an accuracy of approximately 15 per cent . however , perrett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) used the same method employed by bh90 but extended their analysis to 12 absorption - line indices . comparing the line indices with published ( and independent ) metallicities of gcs in m31 , perrett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the ch ( g band ) , mgb and fe53 line indices were the best metallicity calibrators .",
    "consequently , they calculated the final metallicities of their sample by adopting an unweighted mean of these best [ fe / h]-indicators .",
    "as we are dealing with uncalibrated flux spectra , we have preferentially used the relatively narrow metallicity indices ch , mgb and fe5270 , as they are less sensitive to index calibration errors .",
    "in addition , ch and mgb constitute some of the strongest features in the integrated spectra of late - type objects",
    ". however , it is worth emphasizing that due to the different slit positions in the masks , the deimos spectra cover different wavelengths , and thus it was not possible to calculate the three indices for all gcs .",
    "the feature passbands , pseudocontinua and [ fe / h]-calibrations adopted in this work are exactly as defined in bh90 .",
    "the three indices were measured automatically by employing a modified version of the lector code , which was made available by alexandre vazdekis .",
    "the code takes into account the index - band definitions ( see table [ t : index ] ) and the radial velocities to calculate the line indices and their errors accordingly . in fig .",
    "1 we show the location of the three indices on example spectra .    in table",
    "b we list the gc magnitudes , colours , raw indices and spectroscopic metallicities obtained by following the prescription above .",
    "the values given in brackets ( when possible ) correspond to the estimated uncertainty on the indices and metallicities .",
    "the former corresponds to the poisson noise errors , while the latter was estimated by propagating these errors and those associated with the metallicity calibrations themselves ( see last column of table [ t : index ] ) in quadrature .",
    "note , however , that these uncertainties could be underestimated since we are not taking into account other possible sources of error . in fig .",
    "[ f : errorindex ] we show the poisson errors as a function of magnitude for each index . as expected , the uncertainties are higher for the fainter objects , since they have lower s / n ."
