    "very young , massive star clusters ( hereafter vymcs ) , which are compact associations of stars of mass @xmath0 and up to a few myr old , are typically found in locations of high star - formation activity ( or `` starburst regions '' ) in our milky way and external galaxies .",
    "the classical notion implies that such systems form through a single episode of starburst . in this scenario ,",
    "efficient cooling processes within a dense parent gas - cloud lead to the formation of a number of proto - stellar cores .",
    "such an infant star cluster consists of massive main sequence ( ms ) and lower - mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars embedded within the residual gas .",
    "the radiation and winds from the ms and pms stars inject energy into this gas until the latter becomes unbound and escapes the system .",
    "the associated rapid dilution of the potential well causes the system to expand which loses a fraction of its stars depending on its initial mass and concentration @xcite .",
    "the remaining gas - free system may eventually attain a state of virial equilibrium .",
    "such a `` monolithic '' formation scenario has successfully explained the structure and kinematics of galactic and extra - galactic vymcs like the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) and r136 and intermediate - aged clusters like the pleiades and hyades @xcite .    in this study",
    "we incorporate the same properties and parameters ( see below ) of the gas expulsion process as those in the earlier studies @xcite in our realistically detailed model calculations of the time - evolution of star clusters .",
    "we find good and consistent agreement between these model computations and detailed measurements of the central young cluster ( hd 97950 ; hereafter hd97950 ) of the galactic starburst region ngc 3603 which are based on infrared and optical observations with the eso / vlt ( very large telescope ) and the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "in particular , we closely reproduce its observed ( a ) mass density profile @xcite , ( b ) central velocity dispersion @xcite , ( c ) present - day stellar mass function ( pdmf ; @xcite ) , and as well ( d ) the spatial distribution of stars from the crude data @xcite , simultaneously from one individual model calculation .",
    "this not only strongly points to a single - episode formation of hd97950 as envisaged previously @xcite but it also affirms the monolithic formation channel for vymcs in general and suggests that such systems evolve according to universal principles .",
    "we perform time ( @xmath1)-evolutionary calculations that mimic gas - dispersal from model star clusters beginning from their gas - embedded phase .",
    "the star clusters are initialized by distributing stars over a highly compact ( see below ) and spherically - symmetric plummer phase - space distribution @xcite of total stellar mass @xmath2 .",
    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) follows the canonical two - part power - law @xcite .",
    "the dominant physical effect of the embedding gas is taken into account by applying an external potential from a spherically - symmetric mass distribution of total mass @xmath3 following the same plummer distribution as the stars . the gas - depletion is implemented by asymptotically reducing @xmath3 with a timescale @xmath4 after an embedded - phase time - span of @xmath5 as in @xcite .",
    "observations indeed indicate plummer - like sections @xcite of highly compact ( about 0.1 pc in section ) gas filaments within which ( and at their intersections ) the spherical / spheroidal proto clusters form via gravitational fragmentation and collapse @xcite .",

    "[ discuss ] ) .",
    "the timescales @xmath5 and @xmath4 depend on the complicated physics of gas - radiation interaction . for simplicity , we estimate @xmath4 by taking the average radial speed of the expelling gas to be the sound speed in ionized hydrogen ( _ i.e. _ , that of an hii region ) , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath20 . this sound speed corresponds to the typical temperature of @xmath21 k of an hii region @xcite k is the thermal equilibrium temperature where the heating by the ionizing uv radiation ( primarily from the ob stars ) is compensated by the cooling due to the free electrons ( mostly via free - free and free - bound transitions ) in the ionized medium .",
    "neutral hydrogen ( hi ) regions , on the contrary , are much colder ( @xmath22 k ) .",
    "the effective ionization in hii ( by uv ) causes efficient coupling of the radiation flux with the free electrons and hence results in much more efficient energy transfer than that in hi . ] . in other words , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the initial half - mass radius ( @xmath25 virial radius for a plummer model ) of the stellar cluster / gas .",
    "the residual gas begins to launch when it becomes ionized by the ( proto-)stellar radiation so that the latter is coupled efficiently with the gas .",
    "the coupling of the radiation with the resulting hii medium substantially overpressures the latter and can even make it radiation - pressure - dominated ( rpd ) which might briefly drive the gas supersonically in the beginning @xcite .",
    "the expanding gas continues to move out with the sound speed of an hii region once it becomes gas - pressure - dominated ( gpd ) @xcite .",
    "this initial rpd phase is essential for launching the gas from massive clusters whose escape speed exceeds the hii sound speed .",
    "therefore , for massive clusters , the above @xmath4 , from @xmath26 km s@xmath27 , gives an upper limit ( also see @xcite ) ; it can be shorter depending on the duration of the rpd state ( also see sec .",
    "[ discuss ] ) .",
    "this @xmath4 is typically comparable to the dynamical time ( or crossing time over half - mass radius ) @xmath28 of the embedded cluster .",
    "this makes the gas expulsion process `` explosive '' @xcite , where the cluster is unable to adjust itself to the varying gas potential and hence expands `` violently '' .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that for moderate to massive clusters , the energy ( wind+radiation ) injected in the gas by the ob stars within a dynamical time is sufficient to make the gas unbound , supporting an explosive nebula disruption .",
    "as for the delay - time , we take @xmath29 myr as a representative value @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath5 again depends on gas - radiation interaction .",
    "an estimate of @xmath5 can be obtained from the lifetimes of the ultra compact hii ( uchii ) regions which can be upto @xmath30 yr ( 0.1 myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the highly compact pre - gas - expulsion clusters ( sec .  [ res ] ) have sizes ( @xmath24 ) only a factor of @xmath31 larger than the typical size of a uchii region ( @xmath32 pc ) .",
    "if one applies a strmgren sphere expansion scenario ( @xcite and references therein ) to the compact embedded cluster , the estimated delay - time , @xmath5 , before a sphere of radius @xmath24 becomes ionized , would also be larger by a similar factor and hence close to the above representative value .",
    "once the gas gets ionized , it couples efficiently with the radiation ( pressure ) from the o / b stars and is launched immediately ( see above ) .",
    "high - velocity outflows from proto - stars @xcite additionally aid the gas expulsion . a more elaborate calculation of the expansion of a strmgren front through the proto - cluster gas is underway ( pflamm - altenburg , in preparation ) .",
    "admittedly , the above arguments ignore complications such as unusual morphologies of uchiis and possibly non - spherical ionization front , among others , and only provide basic estimates of the gas - removal timescales .",
    "observationally , galactic @xmath33 myr old gas - deprived vymcs such as the onc and the hd97950 imply that the embedded phase can be @xmath34 myr .",
    "the above widely - used analytic gas - expulsion model does realize the essential dynamical effects on the star cluster after the residual gas is depleted .",
    "moreover , the above same values of @xmath35 , @xmath29 myr and @xmath23 ( @xmath20 ) that reproduced the onc and the pleiades @xcite as well as the r136 @xcite also fair excellently with the hd97950 as we shall see in the following sections .",
    "apart from initial systems consisting of only single stars as above , we also create initial systems with primordial binaries which is the realistic case . here",
    "we use a @xmath36% primordial binary fraction at @xmath19 @xcite . for stars of mass @xmath37",
    ", the orbital period ( @xmath38 ) distribution of such binaries is given by the `` birth period distribution '' @xcite which spans over a wide range of period between @xmath39 where @xmath38 is in days @xcite .",
    "we take a thermal distribution of binary eccentricities . with the dynamical evolution and eventual disruption ( by the galactic tidal field ) of the parent cluster ,",
    "such primordial binary population gives rise to the appropriate period distribution observed for low - mass stellar binaries in the solar neighborhood @xcite .    for massive stars of @xmath40",
    ", we adopt a much tighter and narrower initial period distribution given by a ( bi - modal ) pik law ( uniform distribution in @xmath41 ) that spans over the range @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by the observed period distribution of o - star binaries in nearby o - star rich clusters @xcite .",
    "it is currently unclear at which stellar mass the orbital period law changes and how it changes and the above discontinuous switching of the @xmath38-distribution at @xmath43 , therefore , had to be chosen somewhat arbitrarily .",
    "the consistency of the resulting break in the stellar mass function of the computed clusters with the observed one ( see sec .",
    "[ bincomp ] ) provides a justification to the above switching .",
    "apart from the mf - break , our results , as discussed below , are largely insensitive to the switching point of the period law ( in the range @xmath44 , see below ) .",
    "for @xmath40 , we furthermore use biased / ordered pairing in which the stars , picked by optimally sampling @xcite the canonical imf , are arranged in order of @xmath45 and paired sequentially .",
    "this is motivated by the observation that o - stars are typically found in binaries with o / b stars @xcite . for lower @xmath45 ,",
    "the stars are paired by picking each component randomly and independently from the canonical imf .",
    "this is consistent with all available data on young and old galactic field systems @xcite . finally , for",

    ".    it should be noted , however , that the above monolithic cluster formation scenario has nevertheless successfully reproduced onc , pleiades and hyades clusters previously @xcite and as well the r136 @xcite and the hd97950 cluster as in here .",
    "this indicates that although deprived of the details of star - formation and radiation - hydrodynamic processes due to technological bottleneck , the adapted simplified gas - expulsion model and the choices of the parameters might still be an appropriate description of the overall gas expulsion process .",
    "indeed , in a comparative study , @xcite found that analytic gas - potential reduction has essentially the same effect on the cluster evolution as in an sph computation ( for a given sfe ) where the gas is removed via shock heating .",
    "the present work thereby provides another pillar to the to - date widely used classical gas expulsion scenario .    as such , the current state - of - the - art in theoretical research on star formation",

    "the present work provides a plausible set of physical conditions that compellingly evolve to reproduce the detailed observed properties of hd97950 , subject to its photometric and age constraints . _",
    "they comprise a _ solution _ since the same computed model reproduces multiple observed properties of the cluster ( it s density profiles , velocity dispersion and stellar mass function ) . remarkably , the same conditions ( @xmath35 , @xmath87 , @xmath23 , @xmath29 myr ) that reproduced the known properties of the onc and pleiades @xcite also works for the much more massive r136 and hd97950 clusters ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the present work thereby serves as an intriguing evidence that these clusters might have formed monolithically with the chosen parameters being an appropriate description of the overall gas expulsion process .",
    "several authors alternatively propose vymcs to be formed via hierarchical merging of sub - clusters / structures @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite have demonstrated agreements with observed radial cumulative distributions of massive stars and merger products in hd97950 .",
    "this work , although interesting , can not be taken as a vivid counterexample because of notable drawbacks . here",
    ", the representative age of hd97950 has been taken to be 2.5 myr which is far too old compared to the best - fitting age of @xmath33 myr with only a small age spread , as obtained from the cluster s pms - ms cmd @xcite . in 1 myr , the substructures hardly merge to form a single cluster ( _ c.f .",

    "furthermore , no attempt has been made to compare directly measurable quantities like the structure and kinematics of the merged cluster with observations .",
