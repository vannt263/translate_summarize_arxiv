    "called motifs and elements of the _ secondary structure _ @xcite .",
    "the secondary structures are usually characterized as segments of the protein chain possessing a strong regularity in the values of the ramachandran angles @xcite .",
    "the most common of such structures are the @xmath0-helix and the @xmath1-sheet .",
    "there is a general view that the microscopic chirality of individual amino acids is responsible for the twisted shape of @xmath1-sheets in globular and fibrous proteins @xcite .",
    "apart from the flat conformation described by pauling and corey @xcite , a @xmath1-strand can acquire a nonzero degree of helicity with a finite twist along the principal axis of the polypeptide chain .",
    "furthermore , the helical structure of a single strand directly relates to the _ macroscopic _ twisted shape of the whole @xmath1-sheet .",
    "the @xmath1-sheet conformation has been recently exploited as a reference structure for the novel biomaterials produced by large ",
    "scale self ",
    "assembly of oligopeptides in solution @xcite . in the latter refs .",
    "it has been shown that oligomeric peptides can be rationally designed so that they self  assemble unidirectionally in solution forming helically twisted @xmath1-sheet tapes stabilized by a regular arrangement of hydrogen bonds .",
    "the main factors which stabilise the tape structures are : the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the polypeptide backbones , cross  strand attractive forces between sidegroups ( hydrogen bonding , electrostatic and hydrophobic ) and lateral recognition ( steric and @xmath2-@xmath2 interactions ) between the adjacent @xmath1-strands .",
    "the tape structure is regarded as only the first in the hierarchy of equilibrium structures observed with increasing oligopeptide concentration such as the double tapes , fibrils , fibers , and eventually nematic gels @xcite .",
    "this novel route towards engineering of biomaterials is an alternative to some approaches which caused controversy and provides a possibility for simple equilibrium control of the biomaterials architecture , their functional and mechanical properties , as well as the kinetics of their formation in response to ph , temperature and other triggers . among different applications of these biomaterials which could be envisaged",
    "one can mention their current use as three  dimensional scaffolds for tissues growth @xcite .",
    "moreover , these oligopeptides  based assemblies serve as a simple experimental model system which could be used for providing valuable insights into the self  assembly and aggregation mechanisms of natural proteins and , in particular , formation of plaques of @xmath1-amyloids @xcite and fibrous proteins structures .    in terms of computer simulations , a number of molecular dynamics studies of oligopeptide systems were reported recently @xcite .",
    "these works have explored the ( meta)stability of relatively small aggregates over fairly short computing times accessible to simulations , thereby providing valuable structural information which is difficult to extract from the experiment .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to establish whether those structures were sufficiently well equilibrated over such short run times and only several particular oligopeptide sequences were considered .    at present",
    ", there is still no full understanding regarding the details of the functional relationship between the chiral nature of the single @xmath1-strand and the helical geometry of the @xmath1-tape .",
    "more generally , only in recent years the connection between the molecular handedness and the morphology of supramolecular assemblies was examined @xcite .",
    "researchers have found that chirality controls the shape of the macroscopic assemblies not only in natural and synthetic peptides , but also in other biological systems such as lipids , fatty acids , and nucleic acids ( see ref . for a review on models for the formation of helical structures made up of chiral molecules ) .",
    "recently , nandi and bagchi @xcite have proposed a model for the assembly of chiral amphiphilic molecules .",
    "the latter is based on a simplified representation of either the geometry or the potential energy , which is then minimized in order to find the most efficient packing . their results , which are consistent with the experiment , show that chiral tetrahedral amphiphiles of the same handedness assemble at a finite angle with respect to their neighbors , driving the formation process of helical clusters . in @xmath1-sheet tapes a similar behaviour is found , where the microscopic chirality arises from the intra  molecular interactions .",
    "the intermolecular forces then stabilize the tape structure with a finite twist angle observed between the neighboring strands .",
    "this twist angle transfers the chirality from the single strands to the level of the mesoscopic assembly , which hence possesses chirality as well .",
    "this type of the secondary structure could be rationalised as a compromise between the _ out  of  plane _ energy term originated from the chirality of the single peptides and the inter ",
    "molecular ( mainly hydrogen bonding ) energies of the backbones atoms , preferring a flat arrangement .",
    "the main goal of this work is to achieve a fundamental understanding of the way in which the microscopic chirality of single peptide molecules manifests itself at a larger supramolecular scale of the self  assembled tapes . in practice",
    ", we would like to construct a _",
    "minimal _ model capable of capturing the most essential features of this phenomenon . for this",
    ", we shall adopt a simplified coarse  grained description for the rod  like oligopeptides with a nonzero degree of helicity .",
    "our computational study will be based on classical monte carlo simulations in continuous space with the use of the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite much used in polymer simulations .",
    "to describe the inter  molecular hydrogen bonding occurring within two ",
    "dimensional @xmath1-tapes we shall use a coarse  grained description via a combination of the soft  core repulsion terms and short  ranged attractive terms .",
    "furthermore , the microscopic chirality is introduced via an _ ad hoc _ quadratic term .",
    "the functional dependence of the macroscopic twist on the strength of the latter will then be analysed .",
    "the explicit forms for different potential energy terms , including those describing the bonded interaction , and motivation for their choice are detailed in the next section .",
    "a peptide @xmath1-sheet is a regular secondary structure characterised by values of the ramachandran angles lying within the upper left quadrant of the ramachandran plot @xcite .",
    "its basic units are short peptide segments ( called @xmath1-strands ) which are stabilized by an ordered network of hydrogen bonds between the atoms of the backbone .",
    "the spatial sequence of the @xmath1-strands can follow a _",
    "parallel _ or _ antiparallel _ pattern , depending on the reciprocal arrangement of the strands termini .    whether @xmath1-sheets are formed by @xmath1-strands connected via loops regions within the same chain ( intra  molecular sheets ) or from many oligomeric peptides ( inter  molecular sheets ) , as e.g. in synthetic peptides assemblies and @xmath1-amyloids , they all conform to a variety of twisted and curved geometrical surfaces @xcite .",
    "the twisting appears in @xmath1-sheets due to the nonzero chirality of the single strands , the backbone geometry of which can be well approximated by a circular helix . the mathematical definition for the latter is given by the classical differential geometry of curves @xcite .",
    "while fully atomistic computational studies of proteins are quite common , there is also a tradition of using simplified off ",
    "lattice models in the literature @xcite . the latter facilitate simulations by retaining the _ most essential features _ of the peptides and overcome the difficulty with rather excessive equilibration times of the fully atomistic systems , which often raise doubt as to the validity of the final results for them .",
    "a number of important results on fast  folding proteins and peptides have been obtained in the last decade via such coarse  grained approaches @xcite .    in the search of a suitable simplified model for the @xmath1-strand capable of generating a stable two  dimensional tape",
    ", one can use the so  called @xmath3 models @xcite , which retain one interaction site per residue . then the inter ",
    "molecular hydrogen bonds could be incorporated , for example , via the angular  dependent effective potential @xcite .",
    "another direction is to consider a different class of the so  called @xmath3-@xmath4 intermediate level models @xcite , in which two or three interaction sites are retained per residue in the backbone . a two  dimensional aggregate can then be generated by mimicking the hydrogen bonding via a sum of effective lennard  jones terms @xcite , also incorporating the steric effects of the side chain .",
    "although this is still a crude representation for the hydrogen bond , we find the second route quite satisfactory for our purposes .      in our model ,",
    "the coarse  grained geometry of the single @xmath1-strand retains three interaction sites per residue .",
    "the backbone of the single amino acid is represented by two beads named @xmath5 and @xmath6 , standing for the moieties @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "each sidegroup ( amino acid residue ) is then modeled by a bead @xmath9 bonded to @xmath5 .",
    "one could also easily introduce many types of the sidegroups , but we shall defer studying more complicated sequences to the future publications until we are fully satisfied with the performance of the simplest models of homogeneous sequences .",
    "we shall introduce all of the energy parameters of our coarse  grained models in units of @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that these parameters are _ effective _ as we have reduced the number of degrees of freedom considerably by introducing united atoms and by describing the solvent implicitly .",
    "thus , these parameters are temperature  dependent , and so are the equilibrium conformations , even though @xmath10 cancels out formally from the boltzmann weight @xmath11 . in principle",
    ", one could determine how the coarse  grained parameters are related to the fully atomistic ones at a given temperature via a procedure analogous to that of ref . .",
    "however , as any inverse problem , it is a considerably difficult task .    in practice",
    ", we have chosen the temperature equal to @xmath12 k and the numerical values of most of the energy parameters so that they broadly correspond to the typical values in the fully atomistic force fields . concerning the purely phenomenological parameters , such as the chirality parameter , their values",
    "were chosen so that a reasonable experimental range of the twist in the structures is reproduced .",
    "the first choice for the potential energy model follows the guidelines of the model proposed by thirumalai and honeycutt @xcite in their mesoscopic simulations of @xmath1-barrels .",
    "minimal _ forcefield model adopts functional forms of interactions akin to those typically employed in fully atomistic molecular mechanics models .",
    "the length of each bond connecting two monomers is restrained towards the equilibrium value via a harmonic potential : @xmath14 in which @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "bond angles defined via triplets @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are controlled via a harmonic potential of the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 for angles centered at @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively @xcite .",
    "dihedral angle @xmath0 is defined by the following formula : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 torsional degrees of freedom are constrained by a sum of terms associated with quadruplets of successive @xmath5 beads and having the form @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "an additional dihedral term is introduced to force planarity between pairs of subsequent @xmath9 beads : @xmath30 it is applied to the quadruplets @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the presence of this term , increases the stability of the structures , by enhancing the steric hindrance due to the side chains . as mentioned above",
    ", this excluded volume effect is quite essential for generating a two  dimensional tape as the inter ",
    "molecular hydrogen bonds have no directional dependencies in our model .",
    "handedness is introduced in the model via a quadratic term involving only quadruplets of successive @xmath5 beads , that is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is equal to the normalized numerator of the analogous quantity defined in frenet  serret picture of spatial curves @xcite : @xmath36 the dependence of the chirality parameter on the temperature is expected to be relatively weak .",
    "this is in qualitative correspondence with the experimental data @xcite , which has revealed high structural stability of tape assemblies , in a wide range of temperatures , essentially while water remains liquid .",
    "however , more experimental data is required in order to determine how exactly @xmath37 depends on the temperature .      a short  ranged lennard ",
    "jones term is used here in order to represent , in a highly simplified way , the inter  molecular hydrogen bonding typical of @xmath1-sheet structures : @xmath38,\\ ] ] where the energy constant is @xmath39 for all the interactions involving the backbones beads .",
    "the van der waals radius is taken as @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 inter  molecular interactions and as @xmath43 for @xmath44 pairs . a small attractive well",
    "is introduced between pairs of @xmath9 united atoms by choosing @xmath45 and @xmath46 in order to mimic various attractive forces between the sidegroups",
    ".    finally , a soft core ( steric ) repulsion , for all pairs involving @xmath47 and @xmath48 is added : @xmath49 we should emphasise that the intra  molecular non  bonded interactions are only included for pairs of sites connected via more than or equal to three bonds .",
    "the second choice for the potential energy function outlined here provides a more phenomenological approach to the behaviour of the coarse  grained systems from the basic geometrical principles . for details of the frenet  serret picture of curves we refer the interested reader to ref . .",
    "we shall attempt to exploit and generalise yamakawa s geometrical ideas for helical wormlike chain model @xcite .    here",
    "the bond length potential and the non  bonded interactions retain the same functional form as in the model a. the remaining bonded interactions are modeled as follows .",
    "the bond angle potential consists of a sum of harmonic terms involving the curvature @xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , for angles centered in @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively and with the curvature @xmath51 defined as : @xmath56 this definition of curvature is slightly different from the one used by yamakawa as his definition also depends on the pitch of the helix due to a different normalisation condition @xcite .",
    "backbone is constrained towards a planar conformation by the terms : @xmath57 involving only @xmath5 monomers , with @xmath58 .",
    "chirality is introduced here via the term : @xmath59 applied to the quadruplets @xmath60 with @xmath61 .      for simulations we used the in  house monte carlo ( mc ) code named polyplus with the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite and local monomer moves , which represents a straightforward extension to a more generic force ( energy ) field of the implementation described by us in ref .  .",
    "this was extensively used in the past and was quite successful in tackling a wide range of problems for different heteropolymers in solution .",
    "note that the periodic boundary were unnecessary in the present study as we are dealing with an attractive cluster .",
    "therefore , no boundary conditions were required as the centre  of - mass of the system was maintained at the origin .",
    "first , single coarse ",
    "grained @xmath1-strands made of @xmath62 residues are placed into a planar , antiparallel arrangement .",
    "starting from this initial conformation , systems of three different sizes ( namely composed of @xmath63 and @xmath64 strands ) have been studied , using either the potential energy model @xmath13 or @xmath50 and with varied values of the chirality parameter @xmath65 . specifically , we ran simulations in which @xmath65 takes values in the two sets @xmath66 and @xmath67 within the potential energy models @xmath13 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "the difference between the two chosen sets is due to the different way in which the bonded interactions are implemented in both models .",
    "simulations times varied from @xmath68 to @xmath69 monte carlo sweeps .",
    "about one fifth of that was required to achieve a good quality of equilibration , which was carefully monitored by analysing the trends in the potential energy , the radius of gyration of the tape , and the wave number @xmath70 values ; and the rest four fifth of the run time were the production sweeps used for sampling of all observables .",
    "thus , we were able to achieve both a good equilibration and a good sampling statistics for the observables of interest .",
    "the circular helicoid is the minimal surface having a circular helix as its boundary @xcite .",
    "it can be described in the parametric form by : @xmath71 the circular helicoid ( see fig .",

    "the pitch wave number is , by convention , negative if the helix is left  handed and positive in the opposite case .    in order to find a connection between the helicoid and the tapes generated in our simulations , we require a consistent definition of the segment the motion of which in space sweeps the surface . for this purpose",
    ", we can state that each strand s backbone lies along the vector @xmath77,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is taken as the pitch axis of the tape .",
    "furthermore , we have to assume that @xmath79 varies in a discrete way along the tape with @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the _ inter  strand distance _ , ( i.e. distance between the nearest  neighbor strands ) .",
    "this somewhat modifies the calculation of the pitch , namely @xmath82 .",
    "finally , three parameters are necessary to fully identify the vector @xmath83 and the circular helix which delimits the surface .",
    "the instantaneous values of @xmath74 ( the _ tape radius _ ) , @xmath70 and @xmath81 are calculated by taking the vector @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the position of monomer @xmath5 in the @xmath86th residue within the @xmath87th strand ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:0]b for details ) .",
    "the use of the vector @xmath88 is justified because the molecules behave themselves essentially as rigid rods . in more details : @xmath89 this calculation of the parameter @xmath70 , which is related to a cosine , misses the correct evaluation of the sign . to overcome this , an analogous measure related to a dihedral angle",
    "is needed . the _ local dihedral angle _",
    "@xmath90 is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dihe ] ) with @xmath91 monitoring the sign of this quantity gives information about the handedness of the helical cluster .",
    "thus , the complete formula for the calculation of the pitch wave number is : @xmath92 in tab .",
    "[ tab : exp ] we exhibit typical experimental values of the pitch wave number @xmath70 for some of oligopeptide  based supramolecular clusters .",
    "these values were obtained from atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy data .",
    "tape structures in both models @xmath13 and @xmath50 appear to be perfectly stable with single strands packed side by side along the backbone axis .",
    "therefore , the simplistic representation of the hydrogen bonding adopted by us is successful in keeping the strands aligned .    with the increase of the chirality parameter @xmath93",
    "the single strands acquire a somewhat regular twisted geometry .",
    "the handedness and the magnitude of this twist have been quantified by calculating the value of the dihedral angles @xmath94 defined by the quadruplets @xmath95 where @xcite @xmath96 .",
    "right  handed twist and left  handed twist are associated with positive and negative values of @xmath97 respectively .",
    "the averaged values ( over the production monte carlo sweeps , over all but the terminal strands , and over the 7 different @xmath87 ) of these dihedral values and the standard deviations are shown in tabs .  [ tab:0a ] and [ tab:0b ] for the models a and b respectively .",
    "one can see a systematic increase of @xmath97 with the chirality parameter @xmath98 , irrespective of the model choice .",
    "increasing the chirality parameter @xmath98 leads also , as expected , to a persistent macroscopic twist of the tapes , which monotonically increases with the value of @xmath65 .",
    "the numerical measure of the handedness of this twist could be expressed in terms of @xmath99 defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dihe],[eq : lda1],[eq : lda2],[eq : lda3 ] ) .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows that , when chirality is introduced , the sign of lda becomes well  defined and that the absolute value of lda increases with @xmath65 .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark also , as a proof of the consistency of our procedure , that the achiral structure has no well  defined sign for @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , one can observe that after changing the sign of the chirality parameter @xmath65 the sign of @xmath99 , and hence the handedness of the tape , will be reversed ( data not shown ) .",
    "[ fig:2],[fig:3 ] also show averaged equilibrium snapshots related to the systems with different values of the chirality parameter @xmath65 in the models @xmath13 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "> from these one could see how the structures change from a flat into more and more twisted tapes as @xmath65 increases .",
    "next , we would like to compare our simulated structures with the geometry of a left  handed circular helicoid , the definition for which was given in sec .",
    "[ sec : defs ] . specifically , we are interested in characterizing the circular helices which sweep the boundaries of that surface .",
    "the details of calculation of the three parameters , @xmath70 , @xmath81 and @xmath74 , which are necessary for connection of the _ idealized _ geometry with that of the simulated tapes , can be also found in sec .",
    "[ sec : defs ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] .",
    "these values we can calculate from the coordinates of each two consequent strands .",
    "clearly , the chains at the boundaries of the tape behave in a somewhat different way from those buried inside .",
    "more generally , despite of the intra  molecular origin of chirality , the conformation of single strands within a tape also depends on their interactions with nearest ",
    "neighboring strands . as chirality",
    "is increased , the deformation of the flat geometry of a single strand progresses .",
    "therefore , for fairly short tapes with small @xmath100 we could quite significant finite size effects leading to considerable deviations from the regular geometrical surfaces .",
    "thus , we shall compute the average values and the standard deviations of the quantities @xmath70 , @xmath81 and @xmath74 over the span of the tape ( with the exception of the two terminal strands on both edges to reduce the boundary effects ) , as well as over the production sweeps , in order to understand at what extent they vary along the tape .",
    "these values are presented in tabs .",
    "[ tab:1 ] and [ tab:2 ] for the models @xmath13 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "the values of the helix radius @xmath74 does not seem to vary significantly along the tape , which is reflected in a relatively small value of its standard deviation @xmath101 .",
    "evidently , the average value of @xmath74 is essentially independent of the number of strands @xmath100 or the chirality parameter @xmath98 as it is related to the conformation of a single strand . while the standard deviation of the distance between two strands @xmath81 is relatively large",
    ", we do not observe any systematic dependencies of its values on either the location within the tape or the value of the chirality parameter @xmath98 .",
    "a large value of @xmath102 could be attributed to the inter ",
    "molecular interactions contribution to the distances between nearest close  packed strands .    however , the pitch wave number @xmath70 is strongly dependent on the location of the strands pair used in its calculation inside the tape , which is especially striking for small systems made of @xmath103 and @xmath104 chains since they do not as yet complete a full turn of the helicoid .",
    "the results of the calculations of the average and standard deviation of the pitch wave number @xmath70 shown in tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] , tab .",
    "[ tab:2 ] were thus obtained by taking only the three central strands , which has the advantage that the results become less sensitive to the edge  effects .",
    "clearly , the central area of the tape of different sizes @xmath100 behaves , as far as the pitch wave number is concerned , in a similar way and numerically approaches the value of @xmath70 in the tape of @xmath105 strands .",
    "this can also be seen from the histograms ( probability distributions ) of @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "note that the location of the peak of these shifts to the right with @xmath100 somewhat .",
    "the values of @xmath70 which we have obtained in the range of the studied chirality parameter @xmath98 choices correspond to the experimental values of @xmath70 shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : exp ] .",
    "thus , we need about @xmath106 for @xmath107 in our model in order to obtain the highest of the known experimental values of @xmath70 . to check the quality of our parameters",
    ", we then performed , for each system , a self  consistent fitting procedure , in which we considered two data sets , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which are related to the two respective edges of the tape .",
    "these data sets comprised a sequence of the average positions @xcite . of the penultimate monomers in consecutive strands within the tape .",
    "note that the penultimate monomers were considered rather than the end monomers to reduce the `` end effects '' .",
    "also , because the strands were assembled in an antiparallel pattern , one typical sequence of positions would comprise monomers @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 ,  , @xmath114 .",
    "these were fitted with a regular helix described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : helix ] ) sweeping the end of the regular helicoid with the parameters @xmath81 , @xmath74 and @xmath70 calculated from the simulation data .",
    "the fitting procedure for each system produces , as the final output , the two mean displacements @xmath115 and @xmath116 between the _ regular _ helix and the data sets @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively . since the data sets @xmath108 and @xmath109 are statistically equivalent we calculated the mean displacement of our points from the regular helix , @xmath119 , averaged over the two values . as can be seen from tab .",
    "[ tab:3 ] , the resulting mean displacements are relatively small compared to the size of the van der waals radius of various monomers for the systems made of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , our overall procedure is quite satisfactory .",
    "note that a somewhat larger values of @xmath119 for the systems made of @xmath105 strands can be related to the need for a better equilibration in this largest of the studied systems , which was also seen from monitoring the trends in the global observables such as the squared radius of gyration of the tape .",
    "thus , overall , we conclude that both of the potential models suggested here are successful in generating chirality within a stable tape cluster .",
    "in this paper we have proposed two coarse  grained models for short peptides in an extended @xmath1strand  like conformation .",
    "we also have studied these strands self  assembled into a supramolecular @xmath1-tape in case of the model oligopeptides with identical side groups attached .",
    "a fine tuned combination of lennard  jones potential terms was successful in stabilizing the chains within such a two  dimensional structure .",
    "chirality was then introduced on a molecular level with resulting in a regular twist of the surface of the tape .",
    "within the two different models we have investigated the effect of changing the values of the chirality parameter @xmath65 . as we only considered homogeneous sequences yielding tapes with identical sides , the equilibrium structures obtained at the end of the simulations had a geometry of a circular helicoid with the pitch wave number @xmath70 increasing linearly with @xmath65 .    in model",
    "@xmath13 the chirality term is added as a simple asymmetric contribution to the three  folded dihedral potential which is typically used in coarse  grained models of @xmath1-sheets @xcite . the remaining bonded interactions in their analytical expressions and in the numerical strength were taken akin to those of the fully atomistic force fields .",
    "therefore , in essence , here we were introducing chirality into a well  established potential energy model .",
    "model @xmath50 , conversely , is more coarse  grained and relies on the principles of the differential geometry of curves and surfaces @xcite .",
    "importantly , in this model we still have obtained the results comparable to those of the more detailed model @xmath13 .",
    "this establishes a degree of universality in the transfer of chirality from the intra ",
    "molecular to the supramolecular level . despite the difference in the way how chirality was introduced in the both models ,",
    "a macroscopic regular twist was generated equivalently .",
    "both models could be easily extended to include hydrophobic / hydrophilic and explicitly charged sidegroups leading to the difference of the tapes sides , something we would like to study in the future .",
    "such an extended study of different coarse  grained oligopeptide sequences of interest should allow us to describe higher order self  assembled structures ( ribbons , fibers and fibrils ) in detail , providing valuable insights for the experiment .",
