    "an access reservation protocol is instrumental in any multi - user communication system in order to enable users to connect asynchronously or transmit intermittently  @xcite .",
    "the long term evolution ( lte ) system  @xcite uses an access protocol consisting of two phases : a _ contention phase _",
    ", where each user contends by activating a particular reservation token chosen from the set of available tokens ; and a _ data phase _",
    ", where the reservation tokens ( i.e. , token holders ) detected by the base station ( bs ) get assigned resources for the data transfer . the asynchronous access in lte gains importance as the needs to support traffic related to machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communications gets increasingly important . in many cases ,",
    "m2 m traffic is a real - time traffic , where data packets become obsolete after a deadline and thus may undergo only a single contention and data phases , i.e. , unsuccessful transmissions can not be postponed for later contention or scheduled to a later data phase .",
    "the available analysis of the two - phase access reservation protocols typically assumes that : ( 1 ) there are sufficient resources in the data phase to serve all detected reservation tokens ; ( 2 ) the bs is able to discern between reservation tokens activated by one or more than one users , i.e. , the contention phase has a ternary output ( idle , single or collision ) .",
    "however , assumption ( 1 ) does not hold in cellular networks such as lte , where the data phase has limited number of resources , while the network load is variable ; this implies that there is a possibility that the users with real - time traffic that contended successfully may not be assigned a data transmission slot at all  @xcite .",
    "assumption ( 2 ) , by default does not hold in lte , as the bs may not able to discern if a token was activated by one or multiple users  ( * ? ? ? * sec .",
    "17.5.2.3 ) .",
    "in other words , there are practical setups in which the bs can `` see '' that a preamble has been activated , but it does not know how many users activated it .",
    "this implies that in the contention phase , collisions `` over '' tokens are treated as singles , i.e. , the output of the contention phase is binary ( idle or active ) instead of the commonly assumed ternary output ( idle , single or collision ) .    in lte ,",
    "a reservation token is activated by transmitting a specific preamble in the random access sub - frame  @xcite .",
    "the preambles are chosen from the orthogonal set of preambles obtained from zadoff - chu sequences  @xcite . due to orthogonality of the preambles ,",
    "the lte contention phase can be modeled as a framed slotted aloha scheme , where `` slots '' represent preambles over which the users contend .",
    "asynchronous m2 m communications based on lte are considered in several works found in the literature . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose a preamble retransmission method , subject to optimization of the transmission rate . in  @xcite ,",
    "a packet aggregation method is proposed . here",
    ", m2 m devices do not necessarily transmit their packets immediately , but buffer them until a certain threshold .",
    "a closed form expression of the collision probability of m2 m traffic at the lte contention phase is provided in  @xcite . a recent work using a combinatorial model to study the random access in lte is given in  @xcite .",
    "different from  @xcite , we also consider the data phase in our analysis .",
    "an early study of the aloha protocol in a reservation framework was done in  @xcite , and  @xcite consideres two reservation methods based on framed aloha .",
    "access reservation protocols with several parallel data channels have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "herein , the authors find the optimal ratio of control to data channels , and the optimal number of data channels , in terms of throughput .",
    "note that in contrast to  @xcite , in this letter , we consider collisions in the contention phase to be non - destructive .",
    "finally , we point out a recent analysis of random access protocols in the context of rfid systems given in @xcite ; the results presented therein are directly applicable to the contention phase of the access reservation protocol and are used as a starting point for the analysis presented in the paper .    in this letter",
    ", we derive the exact probability mass function ( pmf ) that a number of reservation tokens activated by a single user are assigned resources in the data phase , when assumptions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) do not hold .",
    "based on the obtained results , we calculate the corresponding one - shot success rate and efficiency of the lte access reservation scheme . the presented analysis and derived results are directly applicable to the lte access reservation scheme for the increasingly important case of asynchronously served users with real - time constraints .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "systemmodel ] , we present the system model .",
    "section  [ sec : analyticalmodel ] elaborates the method to obtain the exact pmf of the number of reservation tokens that are activated by a single user and that are assigned resources in the data phase , following by the derivation of the success rate and efficiency .",
    "examples demonstrating derived results are given in section  [ sec : numericalexamples ] , while the letter is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "[ fig : systemmodelreduced](a ) shows a simplified version of the lte access reservation protocol that captures the details essential for the presented analysis  @xcite .",
    "the access reservation is composed of a contention phase and data phase .",
    "the contention phase lasts a single slot and is modeled as a variant of a framed slotted aloha , where users contend over a set of of available tokens ; we assume that in this slot , there are available @xmath0 reservation tokens for contention .",
    "the data phase is a actually a time division multiplexing ( tdm ) scheme and we assume that there are available @xmath1 resource slots ( i.e. , @xmath1 tdm slots ) .",
    "the combination of the two phases is denoted as an access frame , consisting of @xmath2 slots in total .",
    "finally , we assume that there are @xmath3 users contending for the available resource slots .",
    "the access reservation protocol operates as follows :    1 .",
    "each of @xmath3 users activates randomly and independently one of the @xmath0 available tokens .",
    "a token can be activated by more than one user .",
    "base station ( bs ) detects all activated tokens , irrespective whether they have been activated by one or several users  ( * ? ? ?",
    "17.5.2.3 ) .",
    "the bs chooses uniformly randomly @xmath1 tokens from the set of detected tokens .",
    "the selected tokens are assigned a resource slot each and the corresponding users , i.e. , token holders , are informed about the respectively assigned slots through the feedback channel .",
    "the selected token holders transmit their data packets in the assigned resource slots .",
    "if two or more holders activated the same token and thus were assigned the same resource slot , their transmissions collide and are considered as lost .    the assumption that the bs is unable to detect collision in contention phase holds in small cells  ( * ? ? ?",
    "17.5.2.3 ) , and refers to the worst case scenario where the detected preamble does not reveal anything about the number of users that transmitted it .",
    "obviously , if the bs knows that there are two or more users using a certain preamble , then a straightforward way to operate is not to assign any resource slot to the preamble , thus preventing collisions and the respective resource waste in the data phase .",
    ".definition of used variables . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the conditional probability of having assigned @xmath4 contention tokens used exactly by one user each from the contention phase of size @xmath0 to the data phase of size @xmath1 when @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath6 , is derived in this section .",
    "the parameters used in the derivation are listed in table  [ tab : descriptionoftherachmodelvalues ] .",
    "@xmath7    suppose that out of the @xmath0 available tokens , @xmath8 are used by exactly one user each ( singles ) , and @xmath9 are used by two or more users ( collisions ) , where @xmath10 .",
    "from the @xmath0 available tokens , @xmath8 single tokens can be selected in @xmath11 ways .",
    "when @xmath12 .",
    "] further , as the tokens are distinguishable , the number of ways in which @xmath8 of the @xmath3 users can be selected is @xmath13 ways .    from the remaining @xmath14 tokens , we choose @xmath9 for the colliding users , which can be done in @xmath15 ways .",
    "as the tokens are distinguishable , we need to count all permutations of them , which equals @xmath16 .",
    "further , the number of ways in which @xmath17 users can be distributed among @xmath9 tokens such that there are at least two users selecting each token is given by the 2-associated stirling number of the second kind @xmath18 @xcite , which can be computed using the recurrence relation   exposed in the appendix .",
    "the total number of ways in which @xmath3 users can select among @xmath0 tokens without restriction is @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the probability of the @xmath3 users selecting among @xmath0 tokens such that there are @xmath8 tokens used by exactly one user each , and @xmath9 tokens used by two or more users each , equals @xmath20 as similarly derived in  @xcite , although in a different context .    in the data phase , the @xmath21 used tokens are mapped randomly to the @xmath1 resource slots . here",
    "we distinguish between two cases , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the first case ,",
    "all used tokens are assigned to data slots . in the second case , @xmath1 out of the @xmath21 tokens",
    "are randomly selected and assigned to the data slots .",
    "we then have that the probability of selecting @xmath24 slots out of the @xmath1 , such that the selected slots are used by one user each , is given by the hypergeometric distribution @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "note that when @xmath27 , then eq .",
    "equals @xmath28 when @xmath29 , and @xmath30 otherwise .",
    "the probability of selecting @xmath24 slots containing one user each , given that @xmath31 users transmit , is obtained by summing over all cases of @xmath8 and @xmath9 such that @xmath32 , which yields the complete expression of @xmath33 presented in eq .",
    ", where @xmath34 and @xmath26 .",
    "we conclude by noting that holds when @xmath35 and also when @xmath36 .",
    "we use the pmf derived in the previous subsection in obtaining an expression for the success rate , defined as the expected value of @xmath37 given a number of transmitting users @xmath3 @xmath38}{t } = \\frac{1}{t } \\sum_{s=0}^{\\min\\{k , m\\ } } s \\cdot p(s_{d } = s \\vert t = t).\\ ] ] as defined , the success rate takes into account both phases of the lte access reservation scheme and measures the expected fraction of successfully accessing users .    in order to assess how well the slots of the access frame ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : systemmodelreduced](a ) ) are utilized , we define the efficiency , given @xmath31 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , as @xmath39}{k+1}\\ ] ] where the denominator corresponds to the length of the access frame in slots .",
    "in this section , we give examples of the pmf in eq.([eqn : pmftwocol ] ) , the success rate in eq.([eq : throughput ] ) and efficiency in eq.([eqn : efficiency ] ) , both for the cases when @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we first describe the method to obtain the pmf from the simulation .",
    "the method can be summarized in the following three steps .    1 .",
    "let the @xmath3 users select their tokens randomly and independently . for every token , count the number of times this token is selected by the users .",
    "2 .   to simulate a limited data phase , select a random subset of size @xmath1 from the set of tokens .",
    "count the number of successful tokens in this subset , i.e. tokens used by one user . call this number @xmath40 .",
    "3 .   let @xmath41 be the value of @xmath40 obtained in iteration @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the total number of iterations .",
    "the simulated pmf is then @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an indicator function , giving @xmath46 if @xmath47 , and @xmath30 otherwise .     and @xmath36 .",
    "]            fig .",
    "[ fig : probdistcompare ] compares the analytical and simulated pmfs for @xmath48 accessing users , when number of tokens is set to @xmath49 and the number of resource slots is @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ". the analytical pmf is obtained from eq .  , while the simulated one is obtained from running @xmath52 simulation iterations .",
    "we observe a correlation between the analytical and simulated pmfs , validating the presented analysis .",
    "[ fig : expectednumberofsuccessescompare ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : efficiencycompare ] show respectively the success rate @xmath53 , eq .  , and the efficiency @xmath54 , eq .   as functions of number of users @xmath3 , for @xmath49 and varying @xmath1 .    from fig",
    "[ fig : expectednumberofsuccessescompare ] it can be observed that success rate decreases as the number of users @xmath3 increase ; this is due to increasing probability of multiple users selecting the same tokens and , consequently , increasing number of collisions happening in the data phase . on the other hand ,",
    "increasing the number of available resource slots @xmath1 increases the success rate at first , until @xmath1 reaches the number of available tokens @xmath0 .",
    "afterwards , there is no benefit in increasing @xmath1 , as no more than @xmath0 users can be successfully detected and admitted in the system and @xmath55 resource slots will always be left unassigned .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : efficiencycompare ] it is clear that the higher efficiency is achieved when is @xmath1 considerably lower than @xmath0 , which is not a straightforward conclusion .",
    "again , this is because of multiple users selecting the same preambles , which results both in _ collision _ and _ idle _ slots in the data phase ; the chances for the latter increase with the number of available resource slots @xmath1 .",
    "we end this section by noting that , by using the framework presented in paper , the optimal number of resource slots @xmath1 that maximizes the efficiency can be calculated , for fixed number of tokens @xmath0 and number of users @xmath3 .",
    "in this letter we studied a lte based access reservation protocol and provided a method to obtain the exact pmf describing the number of reservation tokens activated by a single user that gets assigned resources in the data phase .",
    "the obtained results are applicable to the case where there are not enough resources in the data phase to serve all detected reservation tokens , and when the base station is not able to discern between reservation tokens selected by one or more than one user ; both assumptions may occur in practice , affecting the operation of the access reservation protocol .",
    "further , based on the presented method we derived the one - shot success rate and efficiency of the scheme , which can be used as performance measures of the constrained access reservation systems , such as lte , in the emerging scenarios with real - time m2 m communication , when there is a limited time to carry out the contention and the data transmissions .",
    "finally , it was observed that although the success rate is maximized when there are the same number of contention and data resources , there is a non - negligible efficiency tradeoff for doing so .    here",
    ", a method to compute the 2-associated stirling numbers of the second kind is presented , based on  @xcite . by definition",
    ", @xmath56 is the number of ways in which @xmath57 objects can be put into @xmath58 boxes , such that each box contains at least @xmath59 objects .",
    "the values of @xmath56 can be computed using the recurrence relation @xmath60 with initial condition @xmath61 . if @xmath62 , @xmath63 or @xmath64 , then @xmath65 .",
