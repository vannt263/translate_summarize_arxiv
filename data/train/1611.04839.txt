    "let @xmath0 be a shimura datum , and @xmath1 the shimura variety attached to @xmath0 and a compact open subgroup @xmath2 of @xmath3 .",

    "we fix a prime number @xmath5 and a place @xmath6 of @xmath4 above @xmath5 , and write @xmath7 for the completion of @xmath4 at @xmath6 .",
    "the main theme of this article is the `` potentially good reduction locus '' of @xmath8 .",
    "to explain what this locus is , let us first assume that @xmath0 is of pel type , in which case @xmath1 parametrizes abelian varieties with additional pel structures .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the universal abelian scheme over @xmath1 .",
    "if moreover the pel datum is unramified at @xmath5 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is hyperspecial , by extending the moduli problem to @xmath12 , we can obtain a good integral model @xmath13 of @xmath1 over @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this model is quite important in the study of the @xmath14-adic cohomology of shimura varieties ; see @xcite for instance .",
    "let us denote by @xmath15 the formal completion of @xmath13 along its special fiber , and by @xmath16 the rigid generic fiber of it .",
    "then , @xmath16 is naturally identified with a quasi - compact rigid - analytic open subset of @xmath17 . for a finite extension @xmath18 of @xmath7 , an @xmath18-valued point @xmath19 of @xmath17",
    "lies in @xmath16 if and only if the abelian variety @xmath20 over @xmath18 has ( potentially ) good reduction . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath16 can be considered as the locus over which @xmath9 has ( potentially ) good reduction . by this reason ,",
    "we will write @xmath21 , and call it the potentially good reduction locus . we also have a rigid - analytic open subspace @xmath22 of @xmath17 for a compact open subgroup @xmath2 whose @xmath5-part is smaller than @xmath11 , by taking the inverse image .",
    "the @xmath14-adic cohomology of @xmath22 can be computed by using the cohomology of the nearby cycle complex , provided that @xmath17 has a suitable integral model over @xmath12 .    in this paper",
    ", we will introduce the notion of the potentially good reduction locus for a general shimura variety .",
    "the rough idea is as follows .",
    "let us fix a prime number @xmath14 .",
    "in the pel type case , let @xmath23 be the @xmath14-adic automorphic tale sheaf on @xmath1 attached to the standard representation of @xmath24 .",
    "then , for a finite extension @xmath18 of @xmath7 and an @xmath18-valued point @xmath19 of @xmath1 , the stalk @xmath25 can be identified with the rational @xmath14-adic tate module @xmath26 . by the neron - ogg - shafarevich criterion",
    ", we conclude that @xmath20 has potentially good reduction if and only if @xmath25 is potentially unramified ( resp .",
    "potentially crystalline ) when @xmath27 ( resp .",
    "@xmath28 ) .",
    "this observation urges us to define in the general case that an @xmath18-valued point @xmath19 of @xmath17 is of potentially good reduction if @xmath25 is potentially unramified / crystalline for every automorphic tale sheaf @xmath23 . actually in the paper , we look at the torsor over @xmath19 obtained as the pull - back of @xmath29 , which is more concise but essentially equivalent to the above way by the tannakian duality .",
    "our potentially good reduction locus is defined as a quasi - compact open subset of the adic space @xmath30 attached to @xmath17 , whose @xmath18-valued points consist of those of potentially good reduction for every @xmath18 .",
    "it is unique , if exists .",
    "we will show the existence of the potentially good reduction locus @xmath22 when the shimura datum @xmath0 is of preabelian type .",
    "recall that @xmath0 is said to be of preabelian type if there exists a shimura datum @xmath31 of hodge type such that @xmath32 .",
    "this class contains almost all shimura data in practice . as in (",
    "* introduction ) and @xcite , a shimura variety is believed to have a moduli interpretation by motives , if the weight homomorphism for @xmath0 is defined over the rational number field . the subset @xmath33 is expected to parametrize motives with potentially good reduction at @xmath6 .",
    "we are also interested in what happens outside the locus @xmath33 . in the pel type case ,",
    "degenerations of abelian varieties occur ; if a shimura variety parametrizes motives , then degenerations of motives should occur . based on this observation",
    ", we will construct a partition of @xmath34 into finitely many locally closed constructible subsets labeled by conjugacy classes of certain kind of adelic parabolic subgroups of @xmath24 , so that the piece corresponding to @xmath24 equals @xmath33 .",
    "it is closely related to the theory of integral toroidal compactifications .",
    "actually , in the pel type case , we may also use the integral toroidal compactification developed in @xcite to construct our partition ( see @xcite ) ; there should be some more cases to which the method in @xcite can be applied ( for example , @xcite ) . however , our argument here is almost totally rigid - geometric , and requires only the existence of the integral toroidal compactifications of the siegel modular varieties with hyperspecial level at @xmath5 ( @xcite ) as an input from the integral theory .",
    "note also that our partition is independent of any choice , unlike the toroidal compactification that depends on the choice of a cone decomposition .    by using the partition above",
    ", we can compare the @xmath14-adic cohomology of the tower @xmath35 and that of @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that @xmath37 is of preabelian type and satisfies the condition sv6 in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 be a prime number different from @xmath5 , and @xmath23 an @xmath14-adic automorphic tale sheaf on @xmath1 corresponding to an algebraic representation of @xmath38 over @xmath39 , where @xmath38 is the quotient of @xmath24 defined in @xcite .",
    "the statement is as follows :    [ thm : main - thm - intro ] in the kernel and the cokernel of the natural map @xmath40 no irreducible supercuspidal representation of @xmath41 appears as a subquotient for any prime number @xmath42 .",
    "recall that an irreducible smooth representation of @xmath41 is said to be supercuspidal if it does not appear as a subquotient of the parabolically induced representations from any proper parabolic subgroup . loosely speaking",
    ", this theorem is a consequence of the observation that the partition of the complement @xmath43 is `` geometrically induced '' from proper parabolic subgroups of @xmath41",
    ". it will be worth noting that our method is totally geometric , so that it is also valid in the torsion coefficient case . see theorem [ thm : main - thm - mod - l ] for an analogue of theorem [ thm : main - thm - intro ] with the @xmath44-coefficients .    we have already mentioned that in the pel type case the @xmath14-adic cohomology @xmath45 can be computed as the cohomology of a nearby cycle complex .",
    "hence , in this case the theorem above says that the nearby cycle cohomology is isomorphic to the compactly supported cohomology up to non - supercuspidal representations .",
    "this result is useful , since it connects the cohomology of shimura varieties and that of rapoport - zink spaces ; see section [ subsec : example ] for a simple example in this direction . recently ,",
    "during the preparation of this article , lan and stroh obtained a stronger result that the nearby cycle cohomology is isomorphic to the compactly supported cohomology in the cases where reasonable integral toroidal compactifications exist ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , we have decided to include our weaker result in this paper , since the argument is totally different .",
    "we sketch the outline of this paper . in section [ sec : gal - rep ] , we consider galois representations of a @xmath5-adic field with values in a general connected reductive group @xmath24 . under some condition , we attach a parabolic subgroup of @xmath24 to such a representation . in section [ sec : rig - semi - ab ] , we give some preliminary results on adic spaces and semi - abelian schemes . in section [ sec : shvar ] , we recall some notation and results on shimura varieties . in section [ sec : partition ] , we construct a partition of the adic space associated to a shimura variety of preabelian type by using results obtained in section [ sec : gal - rep ] .",
    "the potentially good reduction locus is introduced here , as a piece of the constructed partition . in section",
