    "we have found self - consistent steady - state solutions for the velocity function and size distribution of collisional cascades in the super - hill regime .",
    "these solutions occur when mass conservation is satisfied and when viscous stirring balances velocity damping .",
    "three kinds of velocity equilibrium may occur .",
    "for the biggest bodies , which have velocities slower than their escape velocities , viscous stirring and dynamical friction balance .",
    "these bodies velocities increase with decreasing size until the size at which the velocity and escape velocity are equal . since dynamical friction is inefficient for bodies with velocities faster than their escape velocities , stirring balances damping by direct collisions for all smaller bodies .",
    "bodies just smaller than this first transition size have velocities faster than both their escape velocities and the velocity of the largest bodies in the system .",
    "a second transition occurs at the body size whose velocity equals that of the largest bodies in the system .",
    "bodies smaller than this second transition have velocities slower than the largest bodies in the system , so their stirring requires a different cross - section .",
    "the resulting size distributions for the gravity- and strength - dominated regimes are steeper than the ones expected with size - independent velocities .",
    "we find good agreement between the predictions of our theory and the results of our numerical simulations .    to our knowledge ,",
    "previous analytic treatments of collisional cascades have not considered velocity stirring or damping . @xcite and @xcite study disks in which the cascade start time depends on orbital radius because the large bodies needed to excite the velocity dispersion and initiate a cascade take longer to accrete at larger orbital radii .",
    "however , they do not consider the effects of stirring or damping on colliding bodies velocities as the cascade proceeds .",
    "@xcite do account for simultaneous velocity and size spectrum evolution in their coagulation / fragmentation code .",
    "our results here are not directly comparable to theirs because they do not account for energy lost during catastrophic disruptions and because the largest bodies in their simulations continue to accrete while their collisional cascades operate .",
    "we plan to extend and modify our calculations to enable comparison with their findings .",
    "other areas for future investigation include incorporating velocity stirring and damping into collisional cascades covering both the gravity and strength regimes as well as the waves induced in the size and velocity power laws due to transitions between regimes",
    ". a good knowledge of the size and velocity distributions will also allow us to predict observables such as the dust production rate as a function of time and the scale height of the disk as a function of size or , for the smallest bodies , observing wavelength .",
    "ongoing surveys of the kuiper and asteroid belts provide observational size distribution and velocity data to which we can compare our results .",
    "kuiper belt surveys indicate that its size spectrum follows a broken power law whose break falls at a body size of several tens of kilometers @xcite ; this break is interpreted as the top of a collisional cascade .",
    "typical kuiper belt velocities are about 1  km / s , of order 30 times larger than the escape velocities from the largest bodies in the cascade , so the typical bullet / target size ratio is far from unity .",
    "then cooling by catastrophic collisions should be ineffective .",
    "also , the timescales for the observed kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) to collide with bodies of equal size are longer than the age of the solar system .",
    "these kbos have therefore not had time to cool ; we would expect their average velocities should be very similar to those of the primordial kbos .",
    "indeed , small kbos eccentricities and inclinations show no significant trends with size . as for the size distribution , assuming the break exists , surveys find a range of size distributions @xmath161 for kbos smaller than the break size @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath2 we expect if @xmath162 but not strongly constraining . in the asteroid belt , typical relative velocities of @xmath885  km",
    "/ s suggest catastrophic collisions are likewise ineffective at cooling .",
    "surveys of the asteroid belt indicate a size distribution of @xmath163 for large bodies of @xmath164 magnitude smaller than about 15 , or size larger than @xmath881  km ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . for smaller bodies ,",
    "however , the slope becomes shallower ; different surveys report slopes ranging from @xmath165 to @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "while the overall size distribution slope is roughly consistent with the expected @xmath2 , we would predict that the average slope steepen for bodies smaller than about 100  m in size .",
    "still , our theory alone suggests several possible causes for waves that might explain the observed break and its location .",
    "this again makes strong constraints difficult without further data on smaller bodies .",
    "we look forward to future observations of smaller kbos and asteroids whose cooling time may be shorter than the belts lifetimes and which will provide a longer size baseline with which to compare our theory .",
    "future survey results of this kind will provide more stringent tests of our results and may shed light on the catastrophic collision process in our solar system . in particular , measurements of the slopes of the size and velocity distributions would provide a direct probe of the bodies strengths .",
    "similarly , observations of debris disk scale heights as a function of wavelength at millimeter wavelengths , for example with _",
