    "finding the correct model for the formation of structure in the universe is currently a subject of intense study .",
    "it is generally believed that cosmic structures are the result of the gravitational amplification of initially small density fluctuations in the early universe .",
    "there are candidate mechanisms for producing the primordial fluctuations , _",
    "e.g. _ , inflation and topological defects , which must be tested against observations of the current universe . to test these primordial mechanisms",
    ", one has to evolve the perturbations up to the present day .",
    "this task is complicated by the fact that the amount and composition of dark matter is not known , so potentially a large number of possibilities may exist which need to be checked against observations .",
    "the two main pieces of information required for testing theories are the predicted power spectra of the temperature and matter fluctuations .",
    "various prescriptions for how to calculate these exist in the literature ( kodama & sasaki , 1984 : sasaki & gouda , 1986 ; bond & efstathiou , 1987 ; mukhanov , feldman , & brandenberger , 1987 ; durrer & straumann , 1988 ; stompor , 1994 ) .",
    "the problem with these treatments is that either they do not span the current range of models or they that use variables which are unsatisfying in that the physical nature of the initial conditions in is not transparent .",
    "many of the treatments do not include equations for how to deal with the free streaming of massive collisionless relics such as few ev mass neutrinos , an element which is indicated in critical density universe models based on inflation ( schaefer & shafi , 1994 ; pogosyan & starobinsky , 1994 ; liddle & lyth , 1994 ) .",
    "some gauge - invariant treatments which include a treatment of collisionless relics ( durrer & straumann , 1988 ; stompor , 1994 ) use a generalized density perturbation variable ( there are several reasonable candidates ) which has a complicated behavior outside of the horizon and thus makes it inconvenient for specifying initial conditions . here",
    "we present a unified treatment of the evolution of matter and temperature perturbations , which include free streaming massive neutrinos , and use a density perturbation variable which is most natural to use from the point of view of matter perturbations .",
    "we also have attempted to put this into a form which can be easily used by someone to get results without the need to slog through the subtleties of the general relativistic underpinnings of the formalism .    for the sake of brevity",
    "we have only treated flat universes here .",
    "we expect to follow this paper with another which covers universes with curvature .",
    "we begin in section 2 by constructing a gauge - invariant definition of the distribution function , in a slightly different form than that of durrer & straumann , ( 1988 ) .",
    "we then recast the generally covariant boltzmann equation for this distribution function into a more useful form , and this is the basis for the rest of the paper .",
    "we also derive fluid equations for the first three moments of the distribution function . in section 3",
    "we discuss how to treat relativistic collisionless particles , _",
    "e.g. _ massless neutrinos and decoupled photons , using only fluid variable equations .",
    "section 4 explains how to derive initial conditions . in section 5",
    "we discuss how to treat the baryon - photon fluids which are coupled early on , and then show how to calculate the present day temperature anisotropies .",
    "section 6 gives examples of numerical implementation of these equations , and some details about the numerical computations .",
    "we end with a summary of our main results .",
    "lastly , there is an appendix which gives a quick way to calculate transfer functions for some models .",
    "collisionless massive relic particles can not be adequately described in a fluid formulation of the gravitation equations , ( unless the particles are  cold \" on the scales of interest , _ i.e. _ their thermal energy is much less than the gravitational potential of a density perturbation .",
    "one must go back to the boltzmann equation .",
    "since we are working in a regime in which general relativistic effects are important , the best place to start is with the generally covariant boltzmann equation .",
    "this equation has been derived and discussed in many places ( see e.g. , lindquist , 1966 ; ehlers , 1969 ; stewart , 1971 ; kodama & sasaki , 1984 ; durrer & straumann , 1988 ) , and we need not repeat the details here . [ an interesting approach to solving this equation in power series form has also been explored ( rebhan & schwartz , 1994 ) . ] we will only sketch the pertinent parts of the derivation of the perturbed boltzmann equation .",
    "small perturbations of the distribution function of the particles are not in general gauge invariant .",
    "we will remove the gauge dependent part from the distribution function .",
    "next we expand the gauge - invariant distribution function in terms of angular moments , the first three of which are associated with gauge invariant fluid variables : the density , velocity , entropy , and anisotropic pressure perturbations .",
    "we will then discuss the correspondence of the initial values of these moments to the initial fluid variable values .",
    "we end this section with some remarks on the physical interpretation of the equations .",
    "the non  relativistic distribution function specifies the number of particles at time @xmath0 with velocity between @xmath1 and @xmath2 and position between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "since we intend to describe the behavior of relativistic particles in a perturbed spacetime , we need to use a generally covariant formulation , so we must take care that our definition of the distribution function is also generally covariant . for the setup of the boltzmann equation , we follow the treatment of kodama & sasaki , ( 1984 ) .",
    "we will also borrow from durrer & straumann , ( 1988 ) .    in the general relativistic version of kinetic theory",
    ", we use the invariant volume elements to define the distribution function . here",
    "we will need the space - like covariant version of the volume element @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an arbitrary time like vector field and @xmath8 is the totally antisymmetric tensor with @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the metric .",
    "greek indices run from 0 to 3 , while latin indices i through m will run from 1 to 3 .",
    "the other latin indices will be used to distinguish the different component fluids .",
    "the invariant momentum space volume element for a particle with mass @xmath11 is @xmath12 @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the contravariant momentum , the @xmath15 function enforces the relation among energy mass and momentum ( keeps the particle momenta  on the mass shell \" ) , and the heavyside ( @xmath16 ) function restricts us to the regime of positive energies for the particles .",
    "the number of particles crossing a unit hypersurface element @xmath5 within a momentum space volume @xmath12 is given by @xmath17 conservation of @xmath18 along a particle trajectory is guaranteed by the liouville theorem .",
    "any change in @xmath19 due to interparticle collisions can be represented by @xmath20 the relativistic boltzmann equation becomes @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the linear operator which is the total derivative of the distribution function with respect to an affine parameter @xmath23 which traces geodesics . in non - relativistic theory @xmath23",
    "would be identified with the time variable . in our relativistic version ,",
    "@xmath24 is @xmath25 where the momentum is defined , as usual , by @xmath26 and the particles follow geodesics which satisfy @xmath27 the @xmath28 are the metric connection coefficients .",
    "since we are initially interested in collisionless particles we will set @xmath29 . in section 5",
    "we will revisit the collision term for baryon ",
    "photon scattering .",
    "eventually , we will need to relate this microscopic distribution function to macroscopic quantities like the density and pressure .",
    "this is done by taking momentum averages .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor can be obtained from the formula @xmath30 in order to evaluate these integrals and solve the boltzmann equation , one usually introduces a tetrad ( or vierbein ) frame which is convenient for the purpose , usually the one which looks like flat space so that dot products are vectors contracted with the minkowski metric .",
    "kodama & sasaki ( 1984 ) introduce a set of tetrads on which the momentum is physical and redshifts with the universal expansion .",
    "bond & szalay ( 1983 ) and durrer & straumann ( 1988 ) use a tetrad frame on which the momentum are comoving in flat expanding space , which has the advantage that the spatial momentum components are constant in time . here",
    "we will follow the latter convention , and refer interested readers to the original works for more details about the boltzmann equation .",
    "one can define in a covariant way the one - particle distribution function @xmath31 as a scalar function of ( conformal ) time @xmath32 , the comoving three - space coordinates @xmath33 , and the three - momentum @xmath34 ( for particles on the mass shell ) .",
    "we want to consider perturbations on a homogeneous and isotropic background universe , so we split the distribution function into background @xmath35 perturbation .",
    "the spatial dependence of the perturbations can be expanded in terms of harmonic functions @xmath36 , which for flat space ( e.g. , critical density universes ) is like fourier transforming the equations , as @xmath37 .",
    "we then split the distribution function into @xmath38 where the perturbation @xmath39 depends on the fourier wavevector @xmath40 , the time @xmath32 and the three momentum .",

    "the dot ( @xmath49 ) over a variable denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath32 .",
    "the conformal time is more convenient for doing these calculations than the real time @xmath0 .",
    "the conformal time is , in fact , the co - moving horizon size .",

    "in this notation the density and pressure are given by @xmath66 and @xmath67    since on average the universe is homogeneous and isotropic , the background distribution function must also be homogeneous and isotropic and is fixed when ( and if ) the particles were in thermal equilibrium in the very early universe : @xmath68 where the @xmath35 is for fermions and the @xmath69 is for bosons , and @xmath70 is planck s constant divided by @xmath71 .      the boltzmann equation for the perturbation to @xmath31 in eq .",

    "durrer & straumann ( 1988 ) showed how to construct a gauge invariant version of the distribution function perturbation .",
    "the full procedure for doing this is given there .",
    "operationally , all we need to know is that we must add something to @xmath39 so that the appropriate integrals of @xmath39 yield the gauge  invariant density and velocity perturbations .",
    "the construction in durrer & straumann ( 1988 ) was not unique , as one could subtract off the gauge dependence in other ways .",
    "in fact they chose the combination such that when one converts the distribution function perturbation to its corresponding fluid variable density perturbation by integrating over momentum , one would get the density perturbation variable called @xmath76 by kodama & sasaki , ( 1984 ) , @xmath77 by bardeen , ( 1980 ) , and @xmath78 by mukhanov , feldman , & brandenberger , ( 1991 ) .",
    "@xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "instead we would like to make another choice for a gauge  invariant distribution function in which the corresponding gauge invariant density perturbation is the variable called @xmath78 by kodama & sasaki ( or @xmath81 for a particular component ",

    "@xmath83 this variable is @xmath84 in bardeen s notation .",
    "it is the density perturbation on the spacelike hypersurfaces which are the local matter rest frame , and hence is the most natural variable to use from the point of the matter fluctuations . using this variable",
    ", the fluid equations most resemble their newtonian counterparts for a fluid under the action of a gravitational perturbation in expanding coordinates .",
    "also , this is the density perturbation which hu & sugiyama ( 1995 ) used in order to untangle the various effects which contribute to the cosmic microwave anisotropy .",
    "we will comment on this aspect in more detail later .",

    "first of all we see in panel a ) that the cdm component experiences growth which is damped ( relative to figure 1 ) by the effects of photons and neutrinos during the radiation dominated epoch and by the free streaming of the massive neutrinos in the matter dominated epoch .",
    "the time of radiation matter equality is @xmath362 mpc .",
    "the photon ",
    "baryon system undergoes acoustic oscillations maintaining the adiabatic condition @xmath363 until decoupling .",
    "note that the velocity and density perturbations are 90@xmath364 out of phase ,",
    "as the particles flow in and out of the perturbation , the density contrast must lag the velocity . as the photons and baryons begin to decouple",
    ", they undergo viscous ( silk ) damping .",
    "after decoupling , the baryons fall into the potential wells of the cdm component .",
    "the massive neutrinos free stream , but slowly settle into the cdm potential wells as the neutrino momenta redshift .",
    "we next consider a case with isocurvature perturbations , the isocurvature hot dark matter ( ihdm ) model .",
    "we begin the model with the initial conditions as specified in eqs .",
    "( [ dleading ] - [ isosoln ] ) .",
    "again we plot the results in figure 3 for @xmath365 mpc@xmath299 and in figure 4 for @xmath366 mpc@xmath299 .",
    "here there is no cdm component and with @xmath351 we have @xmath367 with a neutrino of mass @xmath368 ev . in panel c ) we plot the total entropy @xmath89 , because of its role in driving the density perturbation growth . in figures 3 and 4",
    "we see that @xmath253 is approximately constant until the induced adiabatic curvature perturbation @xmath78 becomes of the same order . outside the horizon",
    "the neutrino and photon perturbations scale with the ratio of the matter density over the radiation density , while the total perturbation is down by a factor @xmath369 as in eq .",
    "[ isotsoln ] .",
    "the velocities and anisotropic pressure perturbations scale with the amplitude of the induced adiabatic perturbations .    in figure 4 , again we see that @xmath253 remains constant until the induced adiabatic perturbation amplitude becomes comparable .",
    "now we also see that despite the different amplitudes of @xmath253 and @xmath229 the velocity perturbations oscillate together in the same way as in an adiabatic perturbation .",
    "we also see the viscous damping effect , and as in figure 2 the massive neutrinos gradually fall into the potential wells set up by the baryons .    as an example of using our formalism for calculating temperature anisotropies",
    ", we also calculate the multipole moments @xmath292 for gaussian @xmath194 spectra in an adiabatic cdm ( figure 5 ) and an isocurvature hdm universe ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the multipole moments in figure 5 show nearly a horizontal line for the low @xmath320 , as expected from the sachs - wolfe approximation of section 5.2 .",
    "we have normalized the moments to cobe , using the quadrupole ( @xmath370 ) with the value @xmath371 k.",
    "we have presented a simple formalism for following the evolution of density perturbations in the early universe .",
    "our treatment includes the important case of collisionless relic particles like massive neutrinos , which can not be accurately described as a fluid .",
    "the density perturbations variables have properties which make their evolution appear to be newtonian with an expanding space .",
    "this makes it much easier to understand the physics of the evolution , and we find this formalism to be very attractive for this feature alone .",
    "we have demonstrated the use of these equations for transfer functions and temperature anisotropies in both adiabatic and isocurvature models .    we have shown examples here which demonstrate how the formalism works .",
    "the equations here can be easily modified to incorporate other cases , as we have shown elsewhere ( de laix , scherrer , & schaefer , 1995 ) .",
    "the initial conditions are particularly easy to specify here ( especially in isocurvature models ) .",
    "we have presented this new formalism as a working man s set of equations which do not require a deep understanding of general relativity to comprehend the behavior the perturbations under the action of gravity .",
    "lastly , if one is interested in approximate transfer functions we have presented a modified set of equations ( in the appendix ) which can be integrated extremely quickly on a computer .    *",
