    "in living cells , many enzymes consist of several subunits , each of which can bind and hydrolyze atp by itself @xcite . because of the positive or negative cooperativity among the enzyme subunits , this atp hydrolysis process is usually studied by monod - wyman - changeux ( mwc ) model or koshland - nemethy - filmer ( knf ) model @xcite .",
    "however , recent experimental measurements of the mammalian type ii chaperonin tric / cct , which consists of two ring - shaped cavities with lids composed of eight different subunits each , found that the bound adp number presented on a single enzyme can not be well described by the usual cooperative models , mwc model or knf model @xcite .    in experiments",
    "@xcite , the stoichiometry of hydrolyzed atp ( in the form of either bound adp or the transition state mimic , adp@xmath0alfx ) in a single tric enzyme is firstly measured , and then the hydrolyzed atp number distribution is extracted . in this study , we assumed that all the bound atp molecules will be hydrolyzed , and so the number distribution of hydrolyzed atp is just the number distribution of atp bound to one enzyme . as had been concluded @xcite , many standard cooperative models can be ruled out by the measured shape of atp number distribution . in this study , we will not try to give a modified and so more complicated mwc or knf model to fit the experimental data .",
    "on the contrary , we will present a simple thermodynamic model which is only based on boltzmann s law .",
    "in our model , the enzyme tric / cct is regarded as a double - ring with its two rings stack perfectly on one another ( see [ figschematic ] @xcite ) .",
    "each ring consists of 8 cct subunits which can bind and hydrolyze atp by itself .",
    "the potential of each empty subunit ( i.e. without atp molecule ) is denoted by @xmath1 , and the potential of each free atp molecule is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the ( information ) entropy of @xmath3 free atp molecules is denoted by @xmath4 . for the atp bound subunits ,",
    "the potential of the atp - subunit complex depends on the state of its adjacent subunits . for convenience ,",
    "the two subunits which lie in different rings but be adjacent to each other , i.e. the two subunits with the same label number ( see the schematic depiction in [ figschematic ] ) , are said to be _ mirror subunit _ to each other . in the model",
    ", we assume that the two rings of tric are perfectly stacked , i.e. each subunit has and only has one adjacent subunit which lies in the different ring . for one atp bound subunit , if its _ mirror subunit _ is empty and there are total @xmath5 atp bound adjacent subunits , the potential of this atp - subunit complex is denoted by @xmath6 , for @xmath7 . on the other hand , if its _ mirror subunit _ is atp bound , and there are altogether @xmath5 atp bound adjacent subunits , the potential of this atp - subunit complex is denoted by @xmath8 , for @xmath9 ( see [ figpotential ] ) .",
    "since each subunit of chaperonin might be empty ( denoted by 0 ) or atp bound ( denoted by 1 ) , for the double - ring chaperonin tric / cct with @xmath10 subunits ( generally , @xmath11 is between 14 and 18 ) , there are altogether @xmath12 states , denoted by @xmath13 . , @xmath14 denotes the state @xmath15 of chaperonin which satisfies @xmath16 , where @xmath17 or 1 for any @xmath18 . ]",
    "the total potential of the system with chaperonin in state @xmath14 , including potential of the chaperonin subunits and potential of the @xmath19 atp molecules which are bound to or are around enzyme chaperonin , is given as follows , @xmath20 where @xmath21 for @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) is the number of atp bound subunits which have @xmath5 adjacent atp bound subunits ( in the same ring ) , and its _ mirror subunit _ is empty ( or atp bound ) .    based on boltzmann s law ,",
    "the probability of chaperonin in state @xmath14 is @xmath25 since the potential @xmath26 can be reformulated as follows @xmath27 for a given system ( i.e. with fixed @xmath11 and @xmath19 ) , the expression [ eq2 ] of probability @xmath28 can be simplified as follows @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 one can easily show that , the probability @xmath32 that one single chaperonin is bound by @xmath33 atp molecules can be obtained as follows @xmath34 where @xmath35 obviously , there are @xmath36 numbers in set @xmath37 , so intuitively , the maximum of probability @xmath32 will be attained at a number around @xmath38 [ specially , if @xmath39 , @xmath32 is binomial distributed , i.e. @xmath40 . for further details ,",
    "see the langmuir adsorption model @xcite ] .",
    "the average number of atp molecules bound to one chaperonin is @xmath41 where @xmath42    with the model parameters listed in [ table1 ] , theoretical predications of average value @xmath43 and probability @xmath32 are plotted in [ figaveragen ] and [ figprobabilityn ] , which imply that this simple statistical thermodynamics model can fit the experimental data of chaperonin tric / cct well @xcite .",
    "if chaperonin tric / cct is incubated in low [ atp ] solutions , the average value @xmath43 increases rapidly with [ atp ] , but in saturating atp solutions it tends to a constant 8 . for convenience , we denote the state of chaperonin tric / cct by @xmath44[i'_1i'_2\\cdots i'_7i'_8]$ ] , and define @xmath45 , @xmath46 . the plots in [ figmaxprob ] indicate that , for low atp concentration , the dominant state is @xmath47[0\\cdots0]$ ] , but for intermediate and high atp concentration ( [ atp]@xmath48 m ) the chaperonin tric / cct most likely binds @xmath49 atp molecules . by further numerical calculations",
    ", we found that for high [ atp ] , the dominant state of tric / cct is @xmath50[00000000]$ ] or @xmath51[11111111]$ ] .",
    "one also can see from the figures that , although in saturating atp solutions the average value @xmath43 tends to 8 ( see [ figaveragen ] ) , the probability @xmath52 tends to a limit which is less than 0.4 ( see [ figprobabilityn ] and [ figmaxprob ] ) .    since @xmath53 ( see [ table1 ] ) , if there is only one subunit of the present tric / cct which is atp bound , the new arrival atp molecule will most likely attach to one of its adjacent subunits ( in the same ring ) , or for simplicity , denote such process as follows @xmath54[000\\cdots0]+1\\rightarrow [ 011\\cdots0][000\\cdots0]$ ] or @xmath55[000\\cdots0]$ ] .",
    "similarly , one can easily show that , @xmath56[000\\cdots0]+1\\rightarrow [ 01110000][000\\cdots0]$ ] or @xmath57[000\\cdots0]$ ] ( since @xmath58 ) , and @xmath59[000\\cdots0]+1\\rightarrow [ 01111000][000\\cdots0]$ ] or @xmath60[000\\cdots0]$](since @xmath61 ) , etc .",
    "one can also verify that for @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , if bound atp number @xmath64 , the most likely state of tric / cct is that , all these @xmath33 atp molecules are in the same ring and adjacent to each other .",
    "moreover , one can easily show that for any @xmath65 , all the bound atp molecules will most likely gather together ( see [ figstaten ] ) . since @xmath66 , the atp binding to the same ring is positively cooperated .",
    "however , @xmath67 , @xmath68 but @xmath69 implies that the atp binding to different rings is negatively cooperated .",
    "in conclusion , from the viewpoint of statistical thermodynamics , a simple method to describing the atp binding process to multisubunit enzymes is present",
    ". each subunit of enzymes might be in empty or atp bound state , so there are altogether @xmath12 states for one single enzyme with @xmath11 subunits .",
    "the potential of each subunit depends not only on atp binding to itself but also on atp binding to its adjacent ( and _ mirror _ ) subunits .",
    "the probability of enzyme in a special state can be obtained by the boltzmann s distribution .",
    "consequently , the probability of bound atp number in one single enzyme and the corresponding average value of atp number can be obtained .",
    "this model can fit the recent experimental data for chaperonin tric / cct well @xcite .",
    "we find that , in saturating atp solutions , the average number of atp bound to one single tric / cct tends to 8 , and the maximum of probability @xmath32 that there are @xmath33 atp bound to one single tric / cct tends to a value less than 0.4 .",
    "the most likely state of tric / cct is that , all the bound atp molecules are adjacent ( or _ mirror _ ) to each other , and for atp number @xmath70 , all the bound atp molecules will most likely be in the same ring .",
    "the cooperation of atp binding to the same ring of tric / cct is positive , but it is negative for atp binging to the different rings .",
