    "inelastic low - energy raman and high - energy x - ray scatterings have become powerful tools to study the strong electronic correlations in matter@xcite . while the instrumental technique of the light scattering is in rapid progress , the theoretical study of the scattering spectrum is in less development .",

    "the other difficulty lies in the description of the inelastic light scattering processes . unlike the single - particle scattering technique such as the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , neutron scattering etc . , raman and x - ray scatterings involve two - step photon - in photon - out processes .",
    "the cross section of the arpes or neutron scattering is determined by the scattering correlation function which can be studied in perturbation formalism by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "however , a simple extension of this formalism for the two - photon scattering is fail because the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is now invalid .",
