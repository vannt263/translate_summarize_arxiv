    "the planning and success of these experiments relies critically upon understanding the large - scale topology of reionization , i.e. the size- and spatial distribution of the ionized and neutral patches , which is best derived by large - scale simulations .",
    "recently we presented the first large - scale , high - resolution radiative transfer simulations of cosmic reionization @xcite . here",
    "we summarize our basic conclusions about the character of the reionization process , along with some of our recent results on its observability .",
    "the key results for the nature and features of reionization could be summarized as follows :    * reionization proceeds in an inside - out fashion , whereby the high density regions are ionized first and the deepest voids - last , due to the galaxies preferentially forming in and around the high density peaks of the density distribution @xcite . *",
    "the process is thus highly - inhomogeneous and patchy on large scales , with very complex geometry .",
    "it is strongly modulated by the long - wavelength density fluctuations . as a consequence ,",
    "small - volume simulations , which do not include these large - scale fluctuations underestimate the source biasing and the reionization patchiness @xcite . *",
    "the reionization parameters , like source efficiencies ( dependent on the stellar imf , star formation efficiencies and escape fractions ) and small - scale gas clumping , are only weakly constrained at present .",
    "both the overlap epoch , @xmath13 and the integrated optical depth @xmath6 are readily reproduced by a wide range of reasonable reionization scenarios @xcite . *",
    "the h  ii regions have typical scales of 5 - 20 comoving mpc ( dependent on still - uncertain parameters ) . although the high - redshift sources are typically very low - mass , their strong clustering results in the formation of such large ionized patches ( see figures  [ pencil ] and [ peak_evol ] ) .",
    "these characteristic scales are directly reflected in many of the predicted reionization observables @xcite .",
    "* reionization is strongly self - regulated through jeans - mass filtering of the low - mass sources : more efficient low - mass sources ( e.g. due to top - heavy imf ) result in more suppression of the same sources , thereby largely cancelling the effect of the higher efficiency , and vice versa @xcite .",
    "* this process of self - regulation has the effect that @xmath6 and @xmath13 , the overlap redshift are only loosely related and do not impose very strong constraints on the possible reionization scenarios .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath13 depends on the abundances and efficiencies of the high - mass sources , whose formation is not suppressed by reionization , unlike @xmath6 , which depends on both types of sources .",
    "varying the ionizing efficiencies of low - mass sources yields a wide range of @xmath6 values for the same @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "observations of the high - redshift ly-@xmath0 sources , galaxies and qso s , have already provided us with a wealth of information about the state of the igm and the nature of the luminous galaxies at the end of reionization and still hold a lot of promise for the future .",
    "in addition to probing the igm and the source luminosity function ( and thus , indirectly , the halo mass function and ionization source properties ) , they may also be used to constrain the reionization geometry .",
    "the first rare objects form in the highest peaks of the density field .",
    "the statistics of gaussian fields predicts that density peaks are strongly clustered , especially at high redshift . as a consequence , each high - redshift ,",
    "massive galaxy was surrounded by numerous smaller ionizing sources .",
    "self - consistent simulations of such regions require following a large enough volume while at the same time resolving all the low - mass halos which drive reionization , which has not been possible until recently .    in figure  [ peak_evol ]",
    "we illustrate several stages of the reionization history of a high density peak .",
    "the most massive source in our volume ( at @xmath14 ) is shifted to the centre using the periodicity of the computational box . at redshift",
    "@xmath9 the h  ii region is small and the source is invisible due to the damping wing due to the neutral gas outside . by redshift",
    "@xmath15 many more haloes have formed , most of them in large clustered groups .",
    "the h  ii region surrounding the central peak is among the largest , but the central source emission is still strongly affected by damping . only by redshift @xmath16 is the ionized region large enough to render the source unaffected by damping and potentially visible .",
    "the reionization geometry becomes quite complex , most ionized bubbles are interconnected , but large neutral patches remain between them .",
    "finally , by the nominal overlap @xmath12 all ionized regions have merged into one topologically - connected region , although substantial neutral patches remain interspersed throughout our volume , which remains largely optically - thick to both ly-@xmath0 and ionizing continuum radiation . only by @xmath17",
    "this volume becomes on average optically - thin to ionizing radiation .",
    "in figure  [ spectra ] ( left and center ) we show some sample spectra for the same luminous source .",
    "the spectra exhibit extended high - transmission ( 10 - 60% transmission ) regions in the highly - ionized proximity zone of the luminous source , within 5  mpc@xmath18 ( @xmath19   ) .",
    "the center of the peak itself is optically - thick due to its high density .",
    "the infall around the central peak blue - shifts photons , resulting in some absorption behind the redshift - space position of the source . away from the proximity region",
    "the absorption is largely saturated , but there are a number of transmission gaps with up to a few per cent transmission . in figure  [ spectra ] ( right )",
    "we show the ly-@xmath0 source luminosity function at the same redshift . for the weaker sources",
    "roughly half of the intrinsic luminosity is transmitted ( the red wing of the line ) , while the most luminous sources suffer from additional absorption due to the gas infall that surrounds them .",
    "future work will quantify the statistics of these features and its evolution ."
