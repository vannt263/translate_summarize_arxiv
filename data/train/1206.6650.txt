    "inferring patterns of dependence from high throughput geneomic data poses significant challenges .",
    "statistically , the problem is one of learning about dependence structures in high dimension , with relatively low signal . a  promising direction for strengthening this inference is the explicit consideration of information from known `` pathways''biochemical processes described in terms of a series of relationships among genes and their products .",
    "in this paper we take this perspective , and propose a bayesian approach to achieve three related goals in the context of gene expression analysis : to use prior knowledge about pathways to anchor inference about dependence among genes ; to account for this dependence while making inferences about differences in mean expression across phenotypes ; and to explore differences in the dependence itself across phenotypes .",
    "the proposed model builds on the poe model ( @xcite ) and integrates inference about probability of differential expression with inference about dependence between genes through the formulation of a coherent probability model .",
    "our proposed inferences are local in the sense that the model is centered around a specific pathway .",
    "formally , variable selection is used to remove and add structure relative to the centering pathway .",
    "this is in contrast to approaches aimed at learning dependence structures de novo from expression data , without guidance by a prior pathway structure .    some of the existing approaches for probabilistic modeling of dependence structures attempt to explore the space of all possible graphical models , often restricted to directed acyclic graphs ( dags ) or bayesian networks ( bn ) ( @xcite ) and decomposable models ( @xcite ) .",
    "a  comprehensive review of statistical methodology for network data is provided in @xcite .",
    "recent literature includes the application of bn and dynamic bn to microarray data ( @xcite , @xcite ) , with applications and extensions of this methodology reported in @xcite and @xcite , among others . although appealing , these techniques have computational and methodological limitations related to modeling conditional independence under the `` large  @xmath0 , small  @xmath1 '' paradigm and the difficult specification of consistent prior models across dimensions ( @xcite ) .",
    "other authors ( @xcite , @xcite ) have reported difficulties with the performance of standard trans - dimensional mcmc methods ( @xcite ) in the exploration of the model space , and suggested alternative stochastic search schemes . for a decision theoretic",
    "perspective on graphical model selection see @xcite .    to overcome these problems",
    ", we focus on variations of a baseline model that represents known dependence structures .",
    "the centering anchors the model space to a prior path diagram elicited from sets of molecular interactions derived by previous experiments .",
    "our idea is similar to the modeling approaches described in @xcite and @xcite , who introduced conditional independence between genes , via a markov random field defined over binary hidden states of differential expression .",
    "these authors propose to consider a fixed markov random field mirroring exactly the topology of a prior pathway and ignoring the directionality of the edges .",
    "the construction of dependence patterns based on hidden markov random fields had also been previously explored by @xcite in the analysis of cgh microarrays .",
    "we contrast the approach of wei and li ( @xcite ) in three fundamental ways .",
    "first , we provide an alternative interpretation of the connections encoded into a prior pathway .",
    "we develop a prior model for the dependence structure , that is , based on the reciprocal graphs ( @xcite ) .",
    "this class of graphical models takes account of the directionality of the edges included in the pathway and allows for the markovian characterization of cycles , which often arise in biological depictions of genetic interactions . also , recognizing that a known pathway is often summarizing results obtained under different experimental conditions , we allow for significant deviations from the prior dependence structure .",
    "this extension requires explicit consideration of a  model determination strategy , but enables inference on the model parameters as well as inference on the dependence structure between genes . finally , our focus is on identifying significant interactions between genes in a prior pathway , as opposed to identifying differentially expressed genes in a given pathway .",
    "the proposed methodology finds motivation in the analysis of gene expression of epithelial ovarian cancer ( eoc ) patients . in this setting ,",
    "the complement and coagulation cascade pathway ( figure [ fig : pathway ] ) represents a key study target , as disease progression is thought to be highly linked to inflammation and vascularization processes [ @xcite ] .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : poe ] we introduce the proposed model .",
    "section [ sec : inference ] discusses estimation and inferential details associated with the proposed model .",
    "we validate our approach with a simulation study in section  [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "section [ sec : analysis ] employs the model for the analysis of epithelial ovarian cancer expression data , to derive inference about active genetic interactions . in the example",
    ", a well - known molecular pathway provides prior information on the dependence structure .",
    "a final section concludes with a critical discussion of limitations and possible extensions .",
    "in section  [ sec : dependence ] , we discuss graphical models and notation , and in section [ subsec : poe ] , we review the poe ( probability of expression ) model @xcite , which defines biological events via latent three - way indicators of relevant biological states .",
    "the original poe model assumes independence across genes , conditional on hyperparameters .",
    "we extend the original model by formalizing more complex relationships among variables via a cascade of conditional dependences , guided by a predefined interaction map .",
    "the predefined interaction map is formally represented as a graph . in section",
    "[ sec : pg ] we introduce a prior probability model on this graph .",
    "networks of relationships among expression levels can be represented as graphs that describe how genes influence each other [ for an example in ovarian cancer see @xcite ] .",
    "more formally , a graph is often characterized as an algebraic structure @xmath2 , composed of a set of nodes @xmath3 , in our case genes , and a  set of edges @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 denotes a directed edge from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denotes an undirected edge .",
    "a graph @xmath9 defines the markov properties of a statistical model in a graphical fashion , via the specification of a set of conditional dependencies .",
    "biochemical networks often include the presence of cycles and feedback relationships .",
    "this requires some care when trying to characterize a coherent probabilistic model that accurately portrays prior biochemical knowledge . for this purpose ,",
    "we focus on a class of graphical models known as reciprocal graphs [ @xcite ] .",
    "reciprocal graph are defined as a natural generalization of other well - known classes , including directed acyclic graphs ( dag ) and markov random fields , among others .",
    "reciprocal graphs are defined through the coherent probabilistic interpretation of directed @xmath10 , undirected @xmath11 and reciprocal edges @xmath12 . here ,",
    "for simplicity , we consider a subset of the reciprocal graph family excluding undirected edges .",
    "the restriction to only directed edges will later be important to facilitate the mapping of @xmath9 to a simultaneous equation model .",
    "the proposed model and inference is based on the directed graph @xmath9 .",
    "but sometimes it is of interest to describe the implied conditional independence structure , that is , the markov properties .",
    "when desired , the markov properties of our model are defined in terms of an undirected graph @xmath13 elicited via moralization [ @xcite , @xcite ] of a graph @xmath9 . in substance , the moralization procedure consists in adding an undirected edge between parents of a common child and replacing the remaining directed edges with undirected ones . in @xmath14 ,",
    "standard markov field properties hold , in the sense that two genes @xmath15 and @xmath16 are disconnected when they are conditionally independent , given the rest of the genes [ @xcite ] .",
    "for example , consider the reciprocal graph @xmath17 represented in figure [ fig : reciprocalmoral ] .",
    "the class of markov equivalent models spanned by @xmath17 may be represented with the moral ( undirected ) graph @xmath14 , for which the following markov property holds : @xmath18 , that is , @xmath19 .",
    "the correspondence between  @xmath17 and  @xmath14 is not 1-to-1 as @xmath14 could arise from the moralization of an entire class of markov equivalent reciprocal graphs .",
    "further details about moralization in reciprocal graphs and covariance equivalence are discussed in @xcite and @xcite . here , our inference will be based on @xmath9 only , and the directionality will be based on prior knowledge .",
    "the undirected graph @xmath20 provides a convenient summary of the conditional independence structure if desired .",
    "following @xcite , we consider data in the form of an @xmath21 expression matrix @xmath22 , with the generic element @xmath23 denoting the observed gene expression for gene @xmath15 in sample @xmath16 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we introduce latent variables @xmath26 indexing three possible expression categories for each entry in @xmath22 .",
    "for example , if @xmath22 represents ratios of expression level relative to a normal reference , they can be interpreted as high , normal and low . given  @xmath27 , for each gene @xmath15 and each sample",
    "@xmath16 we assume a mixture parameterized with @xmath28 as follows : @xmath29    in words , we assume that the observed expressions arise from a mixture of a gaussian distribution and two uniform distributions designed to capture a broad range of departures relative to the gaussian .",
    "the interpretation of the gaussian component varies depending on the experimental design and sampling scheme , and can be trained in a supervised way if data are available ( @xcite ) .",
    "when the technology used for measuring expression has an internal reference , as in section  [ sec : analysis ] , the high ( low ) class can be interpreted as over- ( under ) expression compared to the reference .",
    "the upcoming definition of a dependence structure will focus on the latent  @xmath27 and define dependence at the level of these indicators .",
    "in other words , the proposed model could be characterized as a boolean network on the latent  @xmath27 .    in ( [ eq : poe ] ) , @xmath30 is a sample - specific effect , included to adjust for systematic variation across samples ; @xmath31 is a gene - specific effect , modeling the overall abundance of each gene , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 parameterize the limits of variation in the tails . finally , @xmath34 is the variance of the normal component of the distribution of gene @xmath15 .",
    "we follow @xcite in defining a  conditionally conjugate prior for @xmath31 , @xmath34 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath35 denote a  gamma distribution with expectation @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the restriction on @xmath40 and @xmath41 ensures that the gene - specific mixture distribution has heavier tails than its normal component , preserving interpretability of the three - way latent classes . for the sample - specific effect @xmath30",
    ", we impose an identifiability constraint @xmath42 with @xmath43 .    specifying a prior model for @xmath27",
    ", we deviate from @xcite , defining the model in terms of latent normal variables [ @xcite ] . for each gene and sample",
    "we introduce a latent gaussian variable  @xmath44 , and define @xmath45 where the distribution of @xmath44 is defined by the following simultaneous equations model ( sem ) : @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the @xmath0-dimensional vector of latent probit scores associated with sample @xmath16 . also , let @xmath49 be the matrix whose diagonal elements are unity and whose off - diagonal @xmath50 components are @xmath51 .",
    "provided @xmath52 is nonsingular , the process above defines a proper joint probability density function [ @xcite ] .",
    "more precisely , defining the marginal precision matrix @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",

    "we use notation @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    in the context of this sem ,",
    "we propose to use a reciprocal graph , @xmath69 , to describe a dependence structure among the three - way indicators  @xmath27 that reflects a priori knowledge about a pathway .",
    "relationships between genes are captured via a set of conditional independences over the joint distribution of the classes @xmath70 .",
    "this is implemented by structuring the matrix @xmath52 so that the off - diagonal element @xmath50 is null ( @xmath71 ) , if and only if the edge @xmath72 is not in @xmath73 [ @xcite ] .",
    "the resulting concentration matrix @xmath74 will have zero off - diagonal elements @xmath75 structured compatibly with the markov properties encoded in the moral graph @xmath76 [ @xcite ] . in summary",
    ", we use the sem to define a probability model that matches the conditional independence structure given by @xmath9 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath52 of the sem index a  family of probability models that adhere to a given independence structure  @xmath9 , including an interpretation of the edge directions .    for each gene and sample , the mean @xmath77 may be modeled as a linear function ( @xmath78 ) of , say , a design vector @xmath79 .",
    "this allows for comparisons across groups .",
    "for example , if @xmath80 and @xmath81 for samples under two different biologic conditions , then the posterior distribution for @xmath82 formalizes inference on the differential expression of gene @xmath15 under the two conditions , adjusting for the dependence among the genes .",
    "finally , the autoregressive scheme in ( [ eq : sem ] ) implicitly assumes that genetic interactions are invariant across all the cross - sample biological variation represented in the study .",
    "relaxing this assumption is important and can be achieved by including an interaction term relating the covariate or phenotype information in @xmath83 with the neighboring probit scores @xmath84 in ( [ eq : sem ] ) . in summary , we assume a mixture model for the observed gene expressions  @xmath23 .",
    "the noisy data @xmath23 is reduced to latent trinary indicators which are used to define the dependence structure . because of the nonlinear shrinkage induced by the mixture model , the @xmath23 do not come from a multivariate normal , and the patterns of dependence",
    "could be more complex .",
    "we define a prior probability model for the dependence structure @xmath9 . in words ,",
    "the prior is based on a pathway diagram that summarizes substantive prior information about the pathway of interest .",
    "we interpret the pathway as a reciprocal graph @xmath85 ( see example in section [ sec : dependence ] ) .",
    "the prior on @xmath9 is defined on the set of all graphs that can be obtained by deleting edges from @xmath86 .",
    "more formally , we define the model space generated by @xmath86 as @xmath87 .",
    "if  @xmath88 comprises a total number of @xmath89 edges , then @xmath90 includes @xmath91 possible models .",
    "the definition of the the prior @xmath92 can be seen as stating joint probabilities for the multiple hypothesis testing problem implicitly defined by inclusion versus exclusion of all possible edges .",
    "following the standard bayesian variable selection scheme [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , we can consider edge inclusions as exchangeable bernoulli trials with common inclusion probability @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath94 is the number of edges included in @xmath9 , it follows that @xmath95 .",
    "when the inclusion probability @xmath93 comes from the beta family ( @xmath96 ) , @xcite and @xcite show that this class of prior model probabilities yield a strong control over the number of `` false '' edges included in @xmath9 .",
    "the associated marginal prior on  @xmath9 becomes @xmath97 .",
    "a key feature of the proposed prior is the restriction to subsets of @xmath86 .",
    "inference under the proposed model populates existing pathways with probabilistic information associated with a biological system at a temporal cross section of its dynamic .",
    "the restriction to @xmath90 is important to keep mcmc posterior simulation across the model space practicable . for global searches , without restriction to a focused set of models , trans ",
    "dimensional mcmc becomes impracticable .",
    "local focus does not preclude some extensions beyond @xmath90 to facilitate discovery of previously unknown interactions .",
    "for example , consider an arbitrary graph @xmath9 , without restriction to @xmath90 , and let @xmath98 denote the number of deleted _ and _ added edges relative to @xmath86 .",
    "one could replace @xmath99 in the prior by @xmath98 and allow for graphs beyond @xmath86 .",
    "little would change in the proposed inference . but centering on models close to  @xmath86 is important .",
    "see also related comments in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our model is completed defining priors over the nonzero parameters @xmath100 @xmath101 .",
    "this defines a conjugate prior for the normal model  ( [ eq : sem ] ) .",
    "this formulation is derived as a natural characterization of the sem in ( [ eq : sem ] ) .",
    "we recognize that assuming full exchangeability over the edges does not make active use of potential prior information on inter - gene relationships , possibly available through public data - bases like kegg or gene ontology .",
    "we note , however , that fine scale prior information on individual interactions is easily included in the proposed inferential framework defining partially exchangeable or independent bernoulli trials with interaction - specific inclusion probabilities , say , @xmath102 . if desired , the model can be extended with @xmath103 for @xmath102 , with hyperparameters chosen to reflect interaction summaries perhaps elicited through available tools like the ` r ` package ` gosim ` .",

    "starting from the complement and coagulation cascade pathway , we identify a set of 24 genes exhibiting patterns of dependence in their differential expression profiles across healthy and tumor tissues .",
    "to interpret our findings , we searched the scientific literature using the information hyperlinked over protein ( ihop ) tool implemented by hoffman [ @xcite ] , available at : http://www.ihop-net.org/unipub/ihop/[www.ihop-net.org ] .",
    "for example , our study confirms the centrality of the peptide il8 ( inteleukin-8 ) in the regulation of the chemokine ( cxc and cc motifs ) genes .",

    "modeling dependence between latent indicators of class membership is likely to represent a more sensible approach for this kind of data , when compared with methods that model correlations between observables directly . acknowledging that a known pathway represents only prior information , we seek posterior inference for the model parameters as well as for the pathway itself via an rj - mcmc scheme .",
    "we showed , through simulation studies , that our model enables the recovery of the true dependence structure , even under a misspecified prior pathway .",
    "our model of mrna abundance relies on the probability of expression ( poe ) model of @xcite , and assumes that the variability of expression across tissue samples can be fully characterized by heavy tailed mixtures of normal and uniform random variables .",

    "the general framework presented in this article is also adaptable to other models of gene expression analysis .    in the construction of the dependent probability model , it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the information provided in a biochemical network .",
    "in fact , a pathway may not necessarily describe relations among transcript levels , although it carries some information about it .",
    "the proposed methodology is currently restricted to known biochemical pathways . nevertheless",
    ", structural restrictions to one or more pathways of interest substantially simplifies computational tractability .",
    "the proposed model complexity is , in fact , only linear in the number of genes and interactions included in the prior graph . in our simulation example",
    "this provided substantially higher power in the detection of meaningful interactions , when compared to standard global search strategies .",
    "computational scalability of the proposed methodology could , however , be an issue , when considering highly saturated pathways including a large number of genes . in these cases , methods based on simplifying assumptions and approximate inference",
    "may indeed prove more feasible as exploratory analytical tools [ @xcite ] .",
    "our model could be extended to discover novel genetic interactions , by allowing the adding of new edges between nodes in the prior graph @xmath86 .",
    "this extension would , however , come at a substantial computational cost and would require a challenging reformulation of the prior over graphs @xmath92 , to penalize for model complexity and , at the same time , to favor models closer to the structure of the prior pathway @xmath86 .",
    "initial progress in this direction was reported by @xcite and , in the context of bayesian networks , by @xcite and it is the subject of active research .    in this article we model dependence between three - way variables as dependence between latent gaussian quantities .",
