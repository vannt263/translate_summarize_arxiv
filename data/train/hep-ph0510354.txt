    "searching for new heavy particles beyond the energy scale of the standard model ( sm ) is an important problem of modern high energy physics . in particular , in recently finished experiments at lep either model dependent or model independent searches for different heavy virtual states were carried out and the masses and couplings of numerous particles entering a number of popular models extending the sm have been restricted @xcite . as a general observation",
    "it was found that the low bounds on the mass of a specific particle are strongly model dependent ones and vary in a wide energy range .",
    "for instance , the lower limit on the mass of the @xmath0 gauge boson changes from @xmath2 gev to @xmath3 tev @xcite . at the accelerators of the next generation ( the lhc , in particular ) the signals of new heavy particles",
    "are expected to be clearly detected and some of them could be discovered .",
    "but the underlying theory beyond the sm will hardly be settled .",
    "these circumstances may serve as a motivation for the model - independent description of new heavy virtual particles with specific quantum numbers .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the approach to pick out uniquely the @xmath0 gauge boson in different scattering processes at low energies has been developed and applied @xcite to analyze the data of the lep2 experiments .",
    "it is based on two main principles : 1 ) the renormalizability of an underlying model extending the sm is assumed ; 2 ) the kinematics features of the specific processes in which the @xmath0 appears as a virtual state are accounted for . the former requirement results in the specific relations between the low energy couplings of the @xmath0 with the particles of the sm called the renormalization group ( rg ) relations and decreasing a number of independent parameters .",
    "the latter gives a possibility to introduce the observables which uniquely determine this state in different scattering processes .",
    "it is important to notice that at each stage of this analysis one also has to take into consideration the derived correlations .",
    "the detailed analysis of the existing in the literature @xcite experimental data for the annihilation @xmath4 processes and the bhabha process , @xmath5 , having as a goal searching for signal of the abelian @xmath0 boson , showed @xcite : 1 ) in the annihilation processes , the present day data are in accordance with the @xmath0 existence , but the data set is not bulk enough to detect the signals at more than the @xmath6 confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "2 ) in the bhabha process , the signals can be determined at the @xmath7 cl .",
    "the mass of the particle was estimated to be @xmath8 tev .",
    "so one has to expect that the increase of the data set could make the signals more evident .",
    "an important finding in ref @xcite was the result that at low energies there are two types of the @xmath0 interactions with the sm fermions compatible with the rg equations .",
    "the first is the well known abelian @xmath0 boson .",
    "and the second one is the `` chiral @xmath0 '' interacting with the left - handed species , only .",
    "the rg relations are different for these cases .",
    "correspondingly , different observables must be constructed in order to pick out the signals of these states .",
    "so , searching for the chiral @xmath0 is of interest as a possibility of new physics beyond the sm .    in the present paper",
    "the effects of the chiral @xmath0 boson in the bhabha process @xmath9 are investigated .",
    "we introduce the one - parametric observable to pick out the low energy coupling of the @xmath0 to the left - handed electrons . because of a few independent couplings entering the cross - section there is other interesting possibility of two - parameter fits .",
    "we find that in both cases the lep2 data show no signals of the chiral @xmath0 boson .",
    "to be self - contained , let us remind the necessary results on the description of the @xmath0 interactions at low energies .",
    "suppose that all new heavy particles are decoupled and the @xmath0 boson is associated with some low - energy gauge subgroup .",
    "then , as it was shown in ref @xcite , its couplings to the sm particles satisfy so - called rg relations required by the renormalizability of the underlying theory beyond the sm . by accounting for the relations the number of independent parameters describing cross - sections can be significantly reduced . notice that all popular @xmath10-based @xmath0 models are embedded into the mentioned relations .    to describe the types of the @xmath0 boson predicted by the rg analysis",
    "let us introduce the phenomenological parametrization of the low - energy @xmath0 couplings to the sm particles @xcite .",
    "the couplings to the sm fermion left - handed doublets and right - handed singlets @xmath11 are described by the lagrangian @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the eigenstate of the @xmath0 gauge group , @xmath14 stands for the charge corresponding to the group , and @xmath15 are the unknown generators characterizing the model beyond the sm .",
    "the generators are diagonal @xmath16 matrices for the fermion doublets and numbers for the fermion singlets . in the same manner ,",
    "the @xmath0 couplings to the scalar doublet @xmath17 are derived by adding the appropriate term to the standard electroweak covariant derivative : @xmath18 where the generator @xmath19 is the diagonal @xmath16 matrix .",
    "the rg relations predict two types of the @xmath0 boson  the abelian and the chiral one .",
    "the couplings of the abelian @xmath0 boson is restricted by the relations @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath16 unit matrix , and @xmath22 is the third component of the fermion weak isospin . as is seen , the set of independent couplings consists of one number for each sm doublet ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) . introducing the @xmath0 couplings to the vector and axial - vector currents ,",
    "@xmath25 we see that the @xmath0 couplings to the axial - vector currents have the universal absolute value , related to the @xmath0 coupling to scalars .",
    "so , we can also use as an independent set of parameters the @xmath0 couplings to the vector fermion currents ( @xmath26 ) and the @xmath0 coupling to the electron axial - vector current ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the second possibility is the chiral @xmath0 .",
    "it is characterized by the constraints @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the third pauli matrix .",
    "the chiral @xmath0 interacts with the sm doublets only that can be described by one parameter for each doublet ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 couplings to the sm scalars necessarily leads to the mixing of physical @xmath1 and @xmath0 states .",
    "it is given by the relation @xcite @xmath30 for both the abelian and the chiral @xmath0 bosons , where @xmath31 is the sm value of the weinberg angle .",
    "as estimates fulfilled at lep2 energies showed , in spite of the smallness , the @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing affects the @xmath1-boson couplings and can produce the effects of the order of that induced by the @xmath0 exchange diagrams .",
    "so it can not be neglected .",
    "due to a reduced number of independent couplings it is possible to pick out the @xmath0 signals in leptonic processes and efficiently constraint the parameters of this particle . in our previous papers",
    "@xcite we have analyzed the signals of the abelian @xmath0 for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 processes .",
    "we constructed the one - parametric sign - definite observables responsible for @xmath35 coupling for each of the processes .",
    "it was also possible to provide the one - parametric sign - definite observable for @xmath36 in the bhabha process @xmath32 .",
    "the lep2 data on @xmath37 processes show the signal for @xmath35 at the 1@xmath38 cl .",
    "the bhabha process is mainly sensitive to the vector coupling @xmath36 , for which the signal is found at the 2@xmath38 cl .",
    "below we turn to the analysis of the bhabha process with the aim to search for the chiral @xmath0 gauge boson .",
    "in four - fermion scattering processes @xmath39 there are two leading - order ( in the improved born approximation ) effects related to the @xmath0-boson existence .",
    "the first one is the amplitude with the virtual @xmath0 exchange @xmath40 . in the lowest order in @xmath41",
    "it is resulted in four - fermion contact couplings , which are various quadratic combinations of @xmath42 for all possible generators @xmath43 for the considered type of the @xmath0-boson .",
    "the second effect is originated by the @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing .",
    "the mixing affects the @xmath1-boson exchange diagram , @xmath44 , by terms of order @xmath45 .",
    "since the mixing angle is proportional to @xmath41 , in the amplitude the leading - order terms are described by the products @xmath46 for all generators @xmath43 .    in what follows",
    "we will use the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath47 as well as the couplings to the vector and axial - vector fermion currents , @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 then , the @xmath0-induced contact couplings are just the quadratic combinations of @xmath51 , @xmath52 ( or , alternatively , @xmath49 and @xmath48 ) , and the @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing effects are described by @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "the above introduced coupling constants are related to the traditional four - fermion contact couplings ( usually marked as @xmath57 ) through the expressions @xmath58 and @xmath59 finally , the @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing angle is determined by @xmath60 as follows , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the leading effects in the cross - section are originated from the interference of the sm amplitude with the new physics amplitude .",
    "for the bhabha process , the generic @xmath0-inspired deviation of the cross - section from its sm prediction is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the cosine of the scattering angle , and @xmath65 are known functions of the center - of - mass energy and the scattering angle .",
    "it can be also expressed in terms of the vector and axial vector couplings : @xmath66    for a fixed @xmath64 the factors @xmath67 are smooth functions of @xmath68 .",
    "however , each factor @xmath69 grows infinitely at @xmath70 .",
    "this is caused by the photon exchange in the @xmath71-channel . due to this singular behavior",
    "the experimental values and the uncertainties change significantly with increasing of @xmath64 . as it was shown in @xcite , it is possible to make the factors finite for all the values of the scattering angle by dividing the differential cross - section by some known monotonic function .",
    "for instance , the factor @xmath72 is a positive monotonic function of @xmath64 .",
    "so it can be chosen for normalization of the differential cross - section : @xmath73 @xmath74    this normalization gives us two benefits .",
    "first , the obtained factors @xmath75 are finite for all values of the scattering angle @xmath64 .",
    "second , the experimental errors for different bins become equalized that provides the statistical equivalence of different bins .",
    "the latter is important for the construction of integrated cross - sections .",
    "the chiral @xmath0 boson does not interact with the right - handed species .",
    "so , only the factors @xmath76 and @xmath77 survive in eq .",
    "( [ dcs - ch ] ) .",
    "they are plotted in fig . 1 for the center - of - mass energy 200 gev .    [ fig - dcs - ch ]    as it was mentioned above , the factors are singular at @xmath78 . on the other hand ,",
    "the normalized deviation of the differential cross - section from its sm prediction , @xmath79 is determined by two finite factors , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dcs - ch - norm ]    as it is seen , the four - fermion contact coupling @xmath82 contributes mainly to the forward scattering angles , whereas the @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing term affects the backward angles . at the lep energies they can be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the contribution of the mixing vanishes with the energy growth .",
    "the key problem of the data treatment is the number of independent parameters which should be determined in an experiment .",
    "a large number of them disperses the experimental statistics leading to significant uncertainties .",
    "this difficulty usually prompts one to consider various restricted models , supposing some couplings to be zero . in those cases",
    "the loss of generality is the price of the statistical adequacy of fits .",
    "the effects of the chiral @xmath0 boson in the bhabha process are described by two unknown parameters , only .",
    "so , we have a possibility to derive the effective experimental constraints on them without any additional restrictions .",
    "first , let us construct a one - parametric observable which is most preferred by the statistical treatment of data .",
    "as is clear , it is impossible to separate the couplings @xmath82 and @xmath83 in any observable which is an integrated cross - section over some interval of @xmath64 .",
    "however , the mixing contribution can be eliminated in the cross - section of the form ( which is inspired by the forward - backward asymmetry ) @xmath84 where the boundary value @xmath85 should be chosen to suppress the coefficient at @xmath83 .",
    "the maximal value of the scattering angle @xmath86 is determined by a particular experiment . in this way",
    "we introduce the one - parametric sign - definite observable sensitive to @xmath82 .",
    "the lep collaborations delphi and l3 measured the differential cross - sections with @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the set of boundary angles @xmath85 as well as the theoretic and experimental values of the observable are collected in table 1 .",

    "the corresponding data are presented in table 2 .",

    "the combined value also shows no signal at the 1@xmath38 cl . from the combined fit",
    "the 95% cl bound on the value of @xmath82 can be derived , @xmath92 .",
    "supposing the @xmath0 coupling constant @xmath14 to be of the order of the electroweak one , @xmath93 , the corresponding @xmath0 mass has to be larger than @xmath94 tev .",
    "now , let us carry out a complete two parametric fit of experimental data based directly on the differential cross - sections .",
    "since in case of the chiral @xmath0 there are only two independent couplings , one has to expect that this fit has to be reliable .    in the fitting we used the available final data for the differential cross - sections of the bhabha process .",
    "the data set consists of 299 bins including the data of aleph at 130 - 183 gev , delphi at 189 - 207 gev , l3 at 183 - 189 gev , and opal at 130 - 207 gev @xcite .    the @xmath90 function reads @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the measured deviation from the sm value of the differential cross - section for the @xmath98th bin ( we used the sm predictions , given by the collaborations ) with the corresponding error , and @xmath99 is the theoretical prediction for the deviation from the sm due to the chiral @xmath0 effects .",
    "the sum runs over all the bins .    according to eq .",

    "the @xmath90-function can be rewritten as follows @xmath106 where upperscript t denotes the matrix transposition , and @xmath107 is the covariance matrix .",

    "the number of non - zero eigenvalues is determined by the rank of @xmath117 , which equals to the number of linear - independent terms in the differential cross - section @xmath113 . in the case of chiral @xmath0-boson",
    ", the rank of @xmath117 equals to 2 .",
    "so , the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) is a quantity distributed as @xmath90 with 2 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) .",

    "the parameter space of the chiral @xmath0 is the plane ( @xmath123 , @xmath60 ) .",
    "the minimum of the @xmath90-function , @xmath124 , is reached at zero value of @xmath123 ( @xmath125 ) and almost independent of the value of @xmath60 ( the maximal - likelihood values of the couplings ) . the 95% cl area ( @xmath126 )",
    "is shown in figure 3 .",
    "[ fig - ch - many ]    as one can see , the zero point , @xmath127 ( the absence of the chiral @xmath0 boson ) is inside the confidence area .",
    "the value of @xmath90 in this point ( 238.62 ) is indistinguishable from the @xmath109 . in other words ,",
    "the set of experimental data can not determine the signal of the chiral @xmath0-boson .",

    "this upper bound is in an agreement with the corresponding result of one - parameter fit ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 mass has to be larger than @xmath130 tev , if the @xmath0 coupling constant @xmath14 is again supposed to be of the order of the electroweak one , @xmath93 .",
    "the fit of the differential cross - sections leads to the better accuracy on @xmath123 than the fit of the integrated cross - sections based on _ the same data_. due to a few number of independent parameters the increase of the dispersion ( inevitable in case if an extra parameter is added ) is compensated by the increase in the bulk of available data . without accounting for the model - independent relations between the @xmath0 couplings it is impossible to obtain such results .",
    "let us summarize the results of our investigation .",
    "the lep2 data for the bhabha process are adjusted to no signals of the chiral @xmath0 both for the one - parameter fit and for the two - parameter one .",
    "we stress once again that the key point of our consideration is the rg relations between the low energy couplings of the @xmath0 with the sm fermions .",
    "they were systematically used through the analysis",
    ". therefore only @xmath0 virtual states are responsible for the deviations of the investigated cross - sections from the sm values .",
    "this is the main feature of the developed approach .",
    "if the relations were not accounted for , no significant constraints have been found .",
    "in contrast , in the `` helicity model fits '' applied by the lep collaborations @xcite the quantum numbers of a specific virtual state , which could be responsible for the signal , remains unknown basically .",
    "the such type fits are based on the effective lagrangian of the fermion contact interactions .",
    "they are mainly intended to detect the signals of any type virtual states contributing to a specific `` helicity model '' with one non - zero contact coupling ( aa - model , vv - model , etc . ) . the more general four - parametric analysis based on the helicity models of the fermion contact interactions",
    "was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite with the aim to describe the all possible deviations from the sm .",
    "the permissible domains in the parametric space of the models have been derived .",
    "but , in this analysis it is also in principle impossible to distinguish the specific states responsible for the deviations .",
    "this is because , as it follows from the above analysis , either the rg relations or the kinematics features of specific processes were not accounted for .    at lep1 experiments @xcite carried out at @xmath1-boson",
    "peak the @xmath1-boson coupling constants @xmath131 , @xmath132 are precisely measured .",
    "the bhabha process shows the 1@xmath38 deviation from the sm values for higgs boson masses @xmath133 gev . it is interesting to estimate the bounds on the @xmath1@xmath0 mixing following from these experiments . to do that ,",
    "let us express the measured parameters @xmath131 , @xmath132 through @xmath123 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and assume that a total deviation of theory from experiments follows due to the @xmath1@xmath0 mixing .",
    "this gives the low bound on the mixing .",
    "if one assumes other possibilities for deviation the mixing is increased . in this way one can check",
    "is this mixing excluded by the experiments or not .      in fig .",
    "4 we reproduce the 1@xmath38 cl area for the bhabha process from ref . @xcite .",
    "let us take the sm values of the couplings corresponding to the top quark mass @xmath136 gev and the higgs scalar mass @xmath137 gev . according to eq .",
