    "after the recent photoemission experiments@xcite on quasi one - dimensional materials , the need of understanding the dynamical spectral functions of strongly correlated electron systems has arised . while the low energy behavior is usually well described within the framework of the luttinger liquid theory,@xcite the experimentally relevant higher energies ( @xmath1 mev ) can be calculated for example by diagonalizing small clusters@xcite or by quantum monte - carlo calculations.@xcite unfortunately , both methods have limitations either given by the small size of the system or by statistical errors and use of analytic continuation . even for the bethe - ansatz solvable models , where the excitation spectra can be calculated , the problematic part of calculating the matrix elements remains : the wave functions are required , and they are simply too complicated .",
    "there is , however , a special class of models , where the evaluation of the matrix elements is made possible through a relatively simple factorized form of the wave - function , and some results were already published by sorella and parolla@xcite for the insulating half - filled case and by the authors@xcite away from half - filling .",
    "the dynamical , zero temperature one - particle spectral functions can be defined as the imaginary parts of the time ordered green s function : @xmath2 @xmath3 is measured in angular resolved inverse photoemission experiments and can be calculated from the lehmann representation : @xmath4 while @xmath5 is measured in the angular resolved photoemission experiments and is given by : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the number of electrons , @xmath8 denotes the final states and @xmath9 destroys an electron with momentum @xmath10 and spin @xmath11 .",
    "if the spectral functions are known , the time ordered green s function can be obtained from @xmath12    the special models for which the matrix elements can be calculated are :    \\i ) the hubbard model , defined as usual : @xmath13 in the limit @xmath14 ;    \\ii ) the anisotropic @xmath15 model @xmath16 in the limit @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the usual projected operators .",
    "actually , the hubbard model in the large @xmath19 limit can be mapped onto a strong coupling model usually identified as the @xmath15 model plus three - site terms using a canonical transformation,@xcite where @xmath20 is small ;    \\iii ) an extension of the @xmath15 model first proposed by xiang and dambrumenil,@xcite defined by the hamiltonian @xmath21 where @xmath22 in the exchange part of the hamiltonian ensures that two spins interact as long as there is no other spin between them . the motivation to study",
    "this model is that , unlike the infinite @xmath19 hubbard model , there is a finite energy @xmath23 associated with spin fluctuations , and this will give us useful indications about the finite @xmath19 hubbard model .    from the models defined above , the hubbard model is the most relevant one .",
    "it plays a central role as the generic model of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "even though it is comparatively simple , it is very difficult to solve except for the one dimensional case , where it is solvable by bethe ansatz.@xcite unfortunately , the bethe ansatz solution is not convenient for direct computation of spectral functions , therefore an alternative approach was needed . in the limit of small @xmath19 one can use the renormalization group@xcite to show that the hubbard model belongs to the universality class of the tomonaga - luttinger model,@xcite usually referred to as luttinger - liquid.@xcite the luttinger liquids are characterized by power - law decay of correlation functions , and nonexistence of quasiparticles.@xcite the underlying conformal field theory can be used to relate the exponents to finite - size corrections of the energy and momentum.@xcite this gives consistent results not only with the renormalization group in the weak coupling regime,@xcite but also with the special case of @xmath14 , where the exponents of the static correlations could be obtained using a factorized wave function.@xcite    actually , the spin - charge factorized wave function also describes the excited states as well,@xcite and it can be used to calculate the dynamical spectral functions as well .",
    "the spectral functions obtained in this way are very educative and in some sense , unexpected .",
    "for example , it turns out that the spectrum contains remnants of bands@xcite crossing the fermi energy at @xmath24 - the so called shadow bands .",
    "also it gives information on the applicability of the power - law luttinger liquid correlation function.@xcite the aim of this paper is not only to give the details of the calculation , that can be useful for other correlation functions , but also to present some new results on the low energy behavior of the charge and spin part ( both for the isotropic heisenberg and xy spin model ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : wavefunc ] we review the factorized wave function and in section  [ sec : specfunc ] we show how the spectral functions can be given as a convolution of spin and charge parts",
    ". sections  [ sec : charge ] and [ sec : spin ] are devoted to the detailed analysis of the charge and spin parts .",
    "the relation to the results obtained from the finite - size corrections and conformal field theory is discussed in section  [ sec : cft ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclu ] we present our conclusions .",
    "it has been shown,@xcite by using the bethe ansatz solution , that the ground state wave function of the hubbard model in the @xmath25 limit can be constructed as a product of a spinless fermion wave function @xmath26 and a squeezed spin wave function @xmath27 .",
    "this can be alternatively seen using perturbational arguments@xcite and then extended to the @xmath15 model in the @xmath28 limit . moreover , the wave function of the excited states are also factorized:@xcite @xmath29    the spinless fermion wave function @xmath26 describes the charges and is an eigen function of @xmath7 noninteracting spinless fermions on @xmath30 sites with momenta @xmath31 where the @xmath32 are integer quantum numbers and @xmath33 .",
    "the charge part is not fully decoupled from the spin wave function @xmath27 , as the momentum @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) of the spin wave function imposes a twisted boundary condition on the spinless fermion wave - function ( each fermion hopping from site @xmath36 to site @xmath37 will acquire a phase @xmath38 ) to ensure periodic boundary conditions for the original problem .",
    "the energy of the charge part is @xmath39 and the momentum reads @xmath40 , or , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : kiq ] ) : @xmath41    on the other hand , the spin wave functions @xmath27 are characterized by the number of down spins @xmath42 , the total momentum @xmath43 , and the quantum number @xmath44 within the subspace of momentum @xmath43 .",
    "they are eigenfunctions of the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath45 with eigenenergies @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 depends on the actual charge wave function @xmath26 . in the case of the @xmath0 hubbard model , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the operators of spinless fermions at site @xmath51 . for the ground state",

    "is independent of the charge part .",
    "the energy of the factorized wave function is then given as the sum of the charge and spin energies , with the assumption that the correct @xmath58 is chosen .",
    "if @xmath25 or @xmath59 , then the spectrum collapses and we can assume all the spin states degenerate , simplifying considerably some of the calculations to be presented later .",
    "furthermore , we choose @xmath7 to be of the form @xmath60 ( @xmath61 integer ) , when the ground state is unique . then in the ground - state the spinless fermion wave - function",
    "@xmath62 is described by the quantum numbers @xmath63 and @xmath64 , so that the distribution of the @xmath65 s is symmetric around the origin and we choose the spin part as the ground - state of the heisenberg model according to ogata and shiba s prescription.@xcite this choice of the spin wave function makes the difference between the @xmath25 and @xmath66 ( the so called @xmath67 model ) limits .",
    "the price we have to pay for such a simple wave function is that the representation of real fermion operators @xmath68 in the new basis becomes complicated . as a first step",
    ", we can write @xmath68 as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 creates a fermion at an unoccupied site and the @xmath71 adds a fermion at an already occupied site , thus creating a doubly occupied site . @xmath72 means the spin state opposite to @xmath11 . this latter process gives contributions to the spectral functions in the upper hubbard band , @xmath73 which can be calculated in a similar way , but we will not address this issue in the present paper .",
    "next , we define the operators @xmath74 and @xmath75 acting on the spin part of the wave function : the @xmath76 adds a spin @xmath11 to the beginning of the spin wave function @xmath77 if @xmath78 , or inserts a spin @xmath11 after skipping the first @xmath79 spins , and makes it @xmath80 long , e.g. : @xmath81 and @xmath82 . the @xmath83 is defined as the adjoint operator of @xmath74 , i.e. it removes a spin from site @xmath79 .",
    "then , to create a fermion at the empty site @xmath84 , we need to create one spinless fermion with operator @xmath85 and to add a spin @xmath11 to the spin wave function with operator @xmath86 : @xmath87 the apparent simplicity is lost for @xmath88 .",
    "then , apart from creating a spinless fermions with @xmath89 in the charge part , we have to consider the following two possibilities : either the @xmath84 site is empty , and with @xmath88 we create a spin at the beginning of the spin wave function with @xmath86 ; or it is occupied , and we insert a spin between the first and second spin in @xmath27 with @xmath90 .",
    "so we end up with @xmath91 b^\\dagger_1 .\\ ] ] obviously we choose the @xmath84 in further calculations for its simplicity .",
    "however , one can show that the final result does not depend on this special choice and the translational invariance is preserved even for these complicated operators .",
    "to use the factorized wave functions in the calculation of the spectral function it is more convenient to transfer the @xmath10 dependence from the @xmath92 operator to the final state : @xmath93 and @xmath94 where the momenta of the final states are @xmath95 .",
    "as we already pointed out , the addition of an electron to the ground state can result in a final state with or without a doubly occupied state . correspondingly , the spectral function has contributions from the upper and lower hubbard bands : @xmath96 .",
    "we will now consider @xmath97 only . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : oswflhb ] ) and ( [ eq : adeclhb ] ) we get the following convolution as a consequence of the wave function factorization : @xmath98 and similarly for @xmath5 : @xmath99 @xmath100 and @xmath101 depend on the spinless fermion wave function only : @xmath102 and they are discussed in more detail in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : charge ] ) .    on the other hand , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are determined by the spin wave function only : @xmath105 and are analyzed in sec .",

    "( [ eq : alhbca ] ) and ( [ eq : blhbca ] ) the simple addition of the spin and charge energies is assumed . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is only valid for the @xmath0 , @xmath28 and the model of xiang and dambrumenil for any @xmath23 . in the other cases",
    "the dependence of @xmath58 on the charge wave function should be explicitly taken into account .",
    "still , it is a reasonable approximation , as the important matrix elements will come from exciting a few particle - hole excitations only , which will give finite - size corrections to @xmath58 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "furthermore , we are neglecting the @xmath106 corrections to the effective operators@xcite and to the wave functions .",
    "the momentum distribution function , @xmath107 can be calculated from the spectral function as @xmath108 , leading to a similar expression as used by pruschke and shiba:@xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 and similarly @xmath111 .    the local spectral function @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",

    "first of all , it turns out that the following sum rules are satisfied for every @xmath43 : @xmath147    in the absence of the anderson orthogonality catastrophe , when @xmath148 , the contribution to the spectral functions comes from one particle - hole excitations only , and the spectral functions are nothing but the familiar @xmath149 .",
    "this is not true any more when we consider @xmath150 . in that case",
    "we get contributions from many particle - hole excitations as well .",
    "the largest weight comes from the one particle - hole excitations , and increasing the number of excited holes , the additional weight decreases rapidly .",

    "( [ eq : aqmatele ] ) we can calculate the matrix elements numerically for all the excitations of the final state , its application is limited to small system sizes ( typically @xmath151 ) .",
    "it is due to the fact that the time required to generate all the possible states ( quantum numbers @xmath152 ) is growing exponentially . therefore , in some of the calculations we take into account up to three particle - hole excitations only .",
