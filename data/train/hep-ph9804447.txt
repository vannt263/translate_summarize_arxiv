    "charged particle multiplicity distributions in inelastic hadron - hadron collisions at high energies are usually described by the negative binomial ( nb ) , for an experimental review see ref .",
    "however the appearance of the shoulder structure observed for the first time by the ua5 collaboration @xcite has led to the use of the weighted sum of two nb s with five free parameters @xcite , where the first nb describes the contribution of soft events ( events without minijets ) and the second one describes the contribution of semihard events ( events with minijets ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend to the collider energies another phenomenological parametrization giving better agreement with lower energy data than nb both for @xmath2@xcite and meson - proton@xcite collisions . in the refs .",
    "@xcite the multiplicity distribution @xmath3 of negatively charged particles produced in inelastic @xmath2 collisions at the center of mass energies @xmath4 below 63  gev have been fairly well described by a two parameter sum of poissonians .",
    "this approach is based on a simple minded quark - parton model in which quarks  @xmath5 interact pairwise independently of one another with the same conditional probability @xmath6 and each @xmath7 interaction leads to the same multiplicity distribution in the final state .",
    "the probabilities for events with 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 @xmath7 interactions are equal respectively to @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 and in terms of a probability generating function , p.g.f .",
    "( for a mathematical formalism see refs .",
    "@xcite ) it leads to the relation    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the p.g.f . for the final distributon and @xmath14",
    "is the p.g.f . for events with one parton - parton collision .",
    "the p.g.f.s for events with two or three parton - parton collisions are simply convolutions @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "good description of the experimental data has been obtained with @xmath17 , the p.g.f . for the poisson distribution .",
    "this parametrization had the strong energy dependence of the parameter @xmath6",
    "@xcite , more smooth energy dependence of the @xmath6 was observed @xcite when the poissonian was replaced by the poisson distribution truncated at zero multiplicity with the p.g.f .",
    "the need for the truncation at zero is explained for @xmath19 collisions by non - zero electric charge of the initial @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 pairs leading to the reduced probability to have zero charged particles in the final state .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath1 collisions where @xmath23 and @xmath24 pairs ( 5 out of 9 combinations ) are neutral .",
    "the model  @xcite is modified in the present paper in the two aspects :    \\a ) the poisson distribution is replaced by the so - called gupta - sarma ( gs ) distribution @xcite with the p.d.f .",
    "@xmath25    the gs distribution having the poissonian as a particular case at @xmath26 and known in mathematical statistics under the name of the plya - aeppli distribution @xcite has physical interpretation in the framework of different models @xcite , see discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the approach advocated by biyajima et al .",
    "@xcite and finkelstein  @xcite the multiplicity distribution originates from the poisson distribution of some clusters , each cluster obeys furry - yule ( or truncated at zero bose - einstein ) distribution , finally it leads to the p.g.f .",
    "one can note that the same form ( 2 ) is valid when the p.d.f . for cluster decay distribution",
    "is a linear fraction @xmath27 , usual for the theory of branching processes , ref .  @xcite . in the gupta - sarma approach",
    "@xcite the system after collision is viewed as one highly excited hadron emitting entity obeying the branching process with the probability per infinitesimal time @xmath28 to produce @xmath29 new particles proportional to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is positive constant .",
    "the solution of the corresponding evolution equation for initial condition with zero particles leads to the p.g.f .",

    "it has been established that the multiplicity distribution for diffractive system with effective mass @xmath33 looks like the multiplicity distribution in @xmath19 collisions at the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath34 , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on diffraction . in this paper",
    "we approximate the diffractive contribution by the form ( 1 ) with @xmath14 equal to the p.g.f . for the poissonian under the crude assumption that the integrated over @xmath33 distribution is similar to the distribution at some effective mass @xmath35 and the final p.g.f .",
    "is given by    @xmath36    with    @xmath37    more careful description of the diffractive - like events with integration over @xmath33 is given in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the section ii the main characteristics of the gupta - sarma distribution are summarized . in the section",
    "iii we present results of fits to the available @xmath19 data and to the @xmath1 data obtained at the @xmath38 collider . in the section iv the discussion and",
    "the conclusions are given .",
    "the mean multiplicity @xmath39 and its dispersion @xmath40 are easily obtained from the p.d.g .",
    "( 2 ) using formulae @xmath41 and @xmath42    @xmath43    to obtain expressions for probabilites @xmath44 one can use the method proposed by finkelstein@xcite .",
    "the p.g.f .",
    "is expressed as a sum of powers @xmath45 , where the denominator represents the well known nb .",
    "then , the contribution to @xmath44 with @xmath46 from the @xmath29-th term is equal to the nb probability to have @xmath47 particles and finally it gives    @xmath48    with    @xmath49    and @xmath50    one can note @xcite that the gs distribution is a particular case of the partially coherent laser distribution pcld ( see review of the pcld in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed the p.g.f . for the pcld is the product of the p.d.f .",

    "it gives the expressions for @xmath52 in terms of the laguerre polynomials@xcite    @xmath53    using iteration relations for the laguerre polinomials @xcite one can obtain next iteration relations for @xmath52    @xmath54    at @xmath55 and    @xmath56    these iteration relations can be useful for calculations at large @xmath0 values .",
    "both for @xmath19 and @xmath1 data we calculate the number of negatively charged particles as @xmath57 , i.e. we count the number of produced pairs of charged particles .",
    "as mentioned above , we truncate the distribution for parton - parton collision in the fits to the @xmath19 data and do not truncate it for @xmath1 data at the collider energies .",
    "the @xmath19 data used  [ 22 - 39 ] are the same as in refs .",

    "@xcite . in the table 1",
    "the results of fits to the distribution with the p.g.f .",
    "( 3 ) are given for the case @xmath26 .",
    "the agreement with experimental data is good , this is expected since even the two - parametr parametrization with the diffractive contribution concentrated at zero multiplicity was successful  @xcite .",
    "one can note also that the mean multiplicity for diffractive contribution , proportional to @xmath58 increases slowly with energy .",
    "non - single diffractive ( nsd ) multiplicity distributions , measured by the ua5 collaboration  @xcite have been parameterized by the distribution ( 3 ) without diffractive component , i.e. by the distribution with three other `` parton - parton collision '' components normalized by the factor @xmath59 .",
    "inelastic multiplicity distribution at @xmath60  gev  @xcite has been parameterized by the full distribution ( 3 ) .",
    "the results of the fits are given in the table  2 both for @xmath61 and for free @xmath6 .",
    "the fixed value of the @xmath6 was chosen on the assumption that the fraction of diffractive like events is equal to 16% , the fraction of the single diffractive events measured by the cdf collaboration at 546  gev@xcite .",
    "the fraction measured by the ua5 collaboration is equal to 11  %  @xcite , corresponding conditional probability @xmath6 is equal to 0.52 .",
    "the results of the fits with free @xmath6 are illustrated in figs .",
    "1 - 3 respectively for inelastic and nsd data at 546  gev@xcite and for nsd data at 900  gev@xcite .",
    "the quality of the fits is quite qood , the fluctuations in the parameter @xmath6 are explained by the our crude treatment of the diffractive component and possible bias in the experimental data .",
    "we have ignored also the nonnegligible contribution of the double diffraction processes in the nsd data .",
    "the influence of the high multiplicity tail on the fit parameters has been observed also , the fit in the region @xmath62 of the inelastic data at 546  gev gives more reasonable value of @xmath58 near 3 , significantly smaller than the values @xmath58 in the table  2 .",
    "the possibility that multiplicity distributions at high energies can split into several structures has been predicted more the 25 years ago@xcite .",
    "for example nielsen and olesen made the statement@xcite : `` if we go to high enough energy one should see a separation of the multiplicity spectrum in a series of equidistant peaks at @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , ... '' .",
    "kaidalov and ter - martirosyan in the framework of the quark - gluon string model have predicted three peaks in the multiplicity distribution at @xmath66  tev  @xcite .",
    "these regge - type models @xcite in principle predict more than three peaks ( structures ) in contrast to our approach with maximum three nondiffractive structures . the prediction for nsd multiplicity distribution at lhc energy @xmath67  tev , calculated with parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 fixed by the expected mean multiplicity @xmath71 is given in the fig .",
    "4 . it seems to be intermediate between the drastic predictions of the regge - type models and more flat predictions based on the parametrization by the weighted sum of the two nb s  @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the multiplicity distributions at collider energies have been fairly well parameterized by the sum of poisson - like gs distributions , with one gs distribution describing the multiplicity distribution for one `` parton - parton '' collision .",
    "an attempt has been made to connect the fractions of events with 1 , 2 or 3 `` parton - parton '' collisions with the fraction of diffractive - like events in a framework of the simple minded parton model .        c.  fuglesang , in multiparticle",
