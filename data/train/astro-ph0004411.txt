    "many neutron star models have thermal surface emission concentrated at magnetic polar caps , which are heated by accretion columns , by precipitating magnetospheric particles , or by anisotropy in the thermal conductivity and heat flow from the interior . a number of authors have computed light curves from such heated polar caps by assuming a stationary dipolar magnetic field and noting that gravitational focusing of the photons can have a substantial effect on the pulse shape ( see , e.g. riffert & mszros  1988 ; zavlin , shibanov , & pavlov  1995 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that resonant scattering on magnetospheric @xmath2 may modify the thermal light curves @xcite .",
    "recently , pulsed x - ray emission , apparently from the stellar surface , has been detected from a number of very short period neutron stars , including the 5.75ms radio pulsar j0437 - 4715 @xcite and the 2.49ms lmxb binary j1808.4 - 3658 @xcite .",
    "for such objects , existing static field and metric approximations may be inadequate .",
    "in this paper we model the effects of rapid rotation on the the surface emission from polar caps .",
    "the most prominent effects are associated with simple doppler boosting at the surface @xcite .",
    "we also model the perturbations associated with the varying time delays of the curved light paths and the pulse distortions resulting from frame - dragging ( labeled here as `` kerr '' ) effects on the space - time metric .",
    "previously , @xcite noticed the above effects .",
    "they modeled the neutron star as a kerr black hole , and computed values for the star s angular momentum while assuming that the neutron star s surface is stationary in the lnrf ( see below ) .",
    "because of this , they arrive at unphysical values for the angular momentum and only include doppler shifts due to frame - dragging .",
    "we use more realistic values of the frame - dragging angular velocity and include the dominant doppler boosts caused by the motion of the star s surface in the lnrf .",
    "these effects are subtle , but with the increased x - ray sensitivity of _ axaf _ , _ xmm _ , and possibly _ usa _ careful observations may uncover signatures of rotational perturbations in high statistics energy - resolved light curves of the shortest - period pulsars .",
    "the effects will be even more prominent when emission arises from higher altitudes , as is likely for the non - thermal radio and high energy pulsations found in a number of millisecond pulsars ( e.g. psr b1821 - 24 , psr j0218 + 4232 ) .",
    "resonant scattering perturbations can also show much larger doppler and kerr effects since the flux is re - directed at several @xmath3 and sent back towards the star . modeling these sources",
    "additionally requires a detailed treatment of the retarded ( swept - back ) @xmath4 field .",
    "we start by emitting photons from heated polar caps , whose boundary is defined by the last `` open '' field lines . for this paper",
    "we adopt the traditional static field , aligned - rotator estimate of the cap size and use units where @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the half - angular size of the polar cap , @xmath8 is the radius of the star , @xmath9 is the angular velocity of the star , our fiducial model has both caps heated and , for the old , cold neutron stars which have been `` recycled '' , or spun up to short periods , we neglect emission from the rest of the star surface . for a rough approximation , we emit a blackbody spectrum , which will suffer simple interstellar extinction before reaching the observer .",
    "the surface emission is assumed to be moderately beamed @xmath10 to mimic the effect of limb darkening .",
    "we have also considered more complicated surface temperature distributions .",
    "fits to real data , seeking to find rapid rotation effects in pulsar light curves , will need to propagate emission from a more realistic thermal spectrum including composition effects , accurate limb darkening , and surface @xmath11 variation .",
    "the present sums , however , suffice to illustrate the size and characteristic shape of rotation - induced light curve perturbations and will be useful as a guide to when such effects need to be considered .",
    "formally , our use of eq .  [ cap ] is inconsistent .",
    "we have computed the cap distortions induced by the rotational sweep - back of the field lines for a non - aligned dipole ( e.g. deutsch  1955 ; romani & yadigaroglu  1995 ) including near - surface modifications due to space - time curvature in a schwarzschild metric @xcite . by generalizing the computation of the field structure of a point dipole in the schwarzschild metric",
    ", we have obtained an expression for a point , rotating dipole in a schwarzschild space - time that goes to the static schwarzschild case when @xmath12 , goes to the rotating point dipole solution when @xmath13 gets large , and satisfies maxwell s equations in the limits @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mass of the pulsar .",
    "we can then use this expression to solve for the field lines that are tangent to the light cylinder and define the boundary of the open zone .",
    "these lines , when traced back to the surface , result in an irregular shape for the field line foot points and cap boundary .",
    "we find that the characteristic cap size is quite close to the simple static estimate for @xmath17ms .",
    "after the inclusion of gravitational focusing , the changed cap shape has negligible effect on the light curve ; however , when higher altitude emission or scattering are considered , the structure of the relativistic swept - back field is quite important .",
    "we defer discussion of these more complex light curves ( t.m .",
    "braje & r.w .",
    "romani , in preparation ) , focusing here on direct surface emission .",
    "our computation is a monte carlo simulation , using the method developed to model resonant scattering perturbations by @xcite .",
    "we have extended the photon propagation code to include frame - dragging effects and have modified the transport to follow multiple energy slices of the emitted spectrum , tracing spectral variation through the pulse .",
    "we assume a @xmath18 , @xmath19 km ( @xmath20 ) radius star , and a fiducial spin period @xmath21ms which gives a cap size of half - angle @xmath22 .",
    "the initial photon directions are drawn in the surface frame with angle @xmath23 distributed relative to the local normal with probability proportional to @xmath24 , and uniformly distributed in @xmath25 .",
    "although magnetic anisotropies in the surface opacity may break the azimuthal symmetry for higher field pulsars @xcite , this is unlikely to be important for low @xmath4 , short period neutron stars .",
    "these angles give an initial four - momentum of the photon , @xmath26    to start the photon trajectories , we must relate a frame co - rotating with the surface of the star , where the photons are emitted with some prescribed spectrum and angular distribution , to a locally lorentz coordinate frame ( locally non - rotating reference frame , hereafter the lnrf ; e.g. , bardeen , press , & teukolsky  1972 ) .",
    "the surface velocity of the pulsar , as measured in the lnrf , is @xmath27^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] where the stellar angular frequency is @xmath28 and the reference frame rotates at @xmath29 .",
    "we make a local lorentz boost to the lnrf @xmath30 choosing the coordinate system so that the y - axis points along the direction of motion , giving @xmath31    finally , we convert the photon four - momentum to boyer - lindquist coordinates , using the transformations : @xmath32 \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 represents any four - vector , the left - hand quantities are in the orthonormal lnrf and the right - hand quantities are measured in the boyer - lindquist frame .    these initial directions are propagated to large radius ( 8@xmath3 ) . the energy boost factor is used to re - weight the surface spectral distribution in the final photon spectrum .",
    "we choose a temperature as measured at the surface of the star of @xmath34 , so that after the schwarzschild gravitational redshift , the temperature at infinity is @xmath35k .",
    "a proper apportionment of photons among final rotational phase ( time ) bins must include time delay effects arising from both the variation in the curved path length traveled to `` infinity '' and from the variation in the gravitational time delays experienced by the null geodesics near the star . in practice , we integrate to a fiducial large radius 8@xmath36 beyond which flat space propagation , and a constant incremental light travel time , takes us to the observer .",
    "the net effect is that the phase coordinate on the two - dimensional sky - map of a photon is corrected by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ( coordinate ) time integrated from the surface to the fiducial radius .",
    "this delay will have its strongest effect at the tails of the light curves , where the photons have both traveled the farthest to reach their final destination and spent the most time near the star , suffering bending and time delay in the gravitational field .",
    "frame dragging effects around a rotating neutron star will depend on the detailed mass distribution , and hence on the equation of state ( eos ) and the spin period .",
    "since neutron stars are moderately centrally condensed and the surface emission starts propagation at @xmath39 , we can adopt a `` roche approximation '' , assuming all mass is near the origin .",
    "this allows us to obtain an approximate set of trajectories by using null geodesics of the kerr metric . for our chosen pulsar period , mass and radius",
    ", we estimate appropriate values for @xmath40 using the numerical models calculated by @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath41 measured in units of m as appropriate to their moderately soft `` fps '' model at @xmath42 and low @xmath36 .",
    "we retain , however , the fiducial @xmath19 km radius estimates ; note that this is conservative in the sense that doppler effects at the true @xmath43 km radius can be even larger .",
    "note also that @xmath44 breaks down at @xmath45ms as the star is rotationally flattened , giving even larger @xmath36 @xcite .",

    "for our fiducial @xmath61 , @xmath21ms case , we have produced high - precision light curves by drawing @xmath62 photons and mapping the phase distribution in each of 10 energy bands .",
    "the computations use simple schwarzschild propagations ( to match the efforts of earlier authors ) , as well as progressively adding the doppler boosts , time delays and frame - dragging propagation effects described in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "the results are displayed as sky - maps ( fig .",
    "[ skymap ] ) with the intensity of radiation plotted as a function of viewing angle @xmath63 and pulsar phase @xmath25 .",

    "[ skymap ] , the left panels compare the maps produced by schwarzschild alone ( upper ) and the combined rotational effects ( lower ) .",
    "several important differences emerge . in the schwarzschild map ,",
    "slightly lighter ( fainter ) bands border each cap ; these are the `` shadows '' of the opposite pole cast by the star and only partially filled by the facing polar cap . with boosting , time delay and frame dragging , the beam of the cap emission is shifted forward and the simple symmetry around the magnetic axis is broken , so these circular shadows do not appear .",
    "the right panels show the variation in the sky - map expected with photon energy . for a @xmath64k ,",
    "these maps represent the energy bands ( at infinity ) @xmath65  kev ( upper ) and @xmath66  kev ( lower ) , respectively .",
    "the dramatic enhancement of the hard emission at the leading edge of the pulse is clear , showing the doppler boost s dominant contribution to the pulse shift .",
    "simple light curves show more clearly the relative contributions to the pulse shape distortions .",
    "since an observer will only obtain one light curve ( @xmath61 , @xmath67 in this case ) , the effects of the different rotational perturbations can only be isolated by looking at shape distortions , not phase shifts .",
    "accordingly , we shift the light curves by the phase of the best - fitting , two - cycle sinusoid ( at @xmath68 ) to allow direct comparisons ( fig .",
    "[ all ] ) .",
    "as noted by earlier authors , gravitational bending in the schwarzschild metric greatly decreases the pulse fraction from hot polar caps , by spreading the beam .",
    "also , for stars with two hot caps and masses and radii similar to the fiducial values chosen here , gravitational focusing causes the pulse from one pole to fall in the shadow of the opposite pole , further decreasing the pulse amplitude .",
    "rotational effects break this degeneracy and increase the pulse fraction even for a symmetric two - pole model by a factor of @xmath69 at @xmath21ms .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ all ] indicates the perturbations in the model light curves ( after shifting to the best match sinusoid ) which result when the propagation time delay effects are ignored . for @xmath21ms",
    "these produce 8% distortions in the light curve .",
    "if `` kerr '' propagation effects are ignored the errors are at the 1% level .",
    "the pulse fraction actually decreases in going from the `` time delay '' case to the `` kerr '' case .",
    "this effect arises because , in the `` kerr '' case , the lnrf has some finite angular velocity with respect to infinity .",
    "this angular velocity effectively reduces the initial doppler boost of the photon from the pulsar s frame to the lnrf .",
    "of course , there is a metric - induced doppler shift due to the angular velocity of the lnrf ( cf .",
    "t component of eq .",
    "6 ) , as noted by @xcite , but this is a much smaller effect than the true doppler shift , reducing the pulse fraction of the `` kerr '' light curve .",
    "the period dependencies of the pulse - shape distortions are summarized in fig .",
    "[ oper ] and table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "we see that even at modest spin frequencies the pulse fraction increases significantly when doppler boosts are considered .",
    "note that we have assumed a relatively compact star , and surface velocities and doppler distortions will be even larger for a stiff eos . for example , using the more realistic radius of @xmath70 km for the fps eos will increase doppler boosts by @xmath71 .",
    "by @xmath72ms frame dragging and time delay effects are quite substantial . in table",
    "[ tbl-1 ] we summarize the pulse fraction ( pulsed counts / total counts ) for doppler boosted light curves and light curves computed with all rotational effects .",
    "these estimates suggest that frame dragging might be measurable below @xmath72ms . in detail",

    "[ energy ] we plot normalized light curves in different energy bands for @xmath21ms .",
    "the shifts here are inherently observable since we have absolute phase information of each energy band with respect to the others .",
    "notice that the total shift between the lowest and highest bands is on the order of @xmath22 . in principle , the energy variations allow us to disentangle effects of the doppler boosting from variations in the underlying star temperature .",
    "sharp spectral features , e.g. absorption lines and edges , will make this task much easier .",
    "with sufficient count statistics we might hope to isolate the various contributions to the rotational perturbations of the pulsar light curves . to gauge the observational precision required , we simulate data drawn from our model light curves and compare various scenarios . one measure of the significance of the departures",
    "is to simulate the data with all rotational effects and to compare with model light curves ignoring either kerr effects or time delay induced perturbations .",
    "for example , for our @xmath21ms fiducial light curves , we find that pulse profiles depart significantly ( 95% confidence k - s statistic ) from doppler - alone models when the energy - summed total light curve contains @xmath91 counts .",
    "this does assume a simple model for the surface @xmath11 distribution ( although gravitational focusing renders results surprisingly insensitive to the detailed cap shape ) .",
    "to isolate rotational perturbations in the presence of an arbitrary cap shape and @xmath11 profile would require significantly more data .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] summarizes the counts required to see doppler and time - delay / frame - dragging induced distortions for various @xmath92 .",
    "intra - band comparisons for a single pulsar are even more robust , since cap shape and @xmath11 effects will be correlated at the various energies .",
    "we have modeled the energy - dependent shape changes . at @xmath21ms",
    "we find that a total of @xmath93 counts are required to measure the doppler induced differences between narrow - band lightcurves ( 10 bands assumed , logarithmically - spaced in energy ) .",
    "for a nearby millisecond pulsar with @xmath94k , @xmath95 , we find the most statistically significant differences are typically between the energies ( at infinity ) less than 0.14  kev and greater than 0.28  kev .",
    "these estimates are conservative in that we use only the pulse shape and phase differences",
    ". the actual count ratios between energy channels may be used to check the surface @xmath11 dependence or to allow detection with even lower total counts .",
    "we conclude that high precision models of pulsars such as j0437 - 4715 must include at least doppler boosting at the surface .",
    "for example @xcite have published rosat pspc light curves with good statistics in energy bands extending to @xmath96  kev with @xmath97 binning . using model atmospheres and schwarzschild photon propagation ,",
    "they have fit for @xmath98 and @xmath63 , cap size and the detailed @xmath11 distribution .",
    "our simulations ( fig .",
    "[ all ] ) suggest that the model light curves ( and the parameter values fit ) ignoring rotational effects may be substantially in error .",
    "for example , fitted @xmath99 ratios must be considered preliminary until the effects of rotation are checked . on the other hand the ( formally independent )",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath16 dependencies that can be traced to doppler and gravitational effects suggest that more precise tests of the eos could be effected with very high quality data and detailed models .",
    "high precision _ xmm _ and _ axaf _ data , which are expected , should be suitable for such fitting .",
    "a second example is the newly - discovered 2.49ms accretion - powered pulsar j1808 - 3658 .",
    "this source displays strong `` soft lags '' @xcite in the light curves .",
    "@xcite has already suggested that this pulsar , as well as a number of qpo sources , exhibits significant doppler boosting which causes the high energy pulse to lead the softer emission .",
    "alternative explanations , such as compton down - scatter in a soft corona have been suggested ; however , the energy - dependent pulse shape distortions @xcite appear very similar to those of fig .",
    "[ energy ] .",
    "our computations thus provide significant support for the doppler boosting interpretation . with more careful modeling",
    "it may possible to detect the effect of other rotational distortions to the light curves of this source .",
    "doppler boosting effects are very significant for these short period thermal cap emitters .",
    "time - delay and frame - dragging distortions , although more subtle , have characteristic shapes that may allow detection . sources with sharp pulse features , such as the radio and magnetospheric x - ray millisecond pulsars ,",
    "provide other interesting targets .",
    "resonant compton scattering can also impart sharp light curve features relatively high in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "doppler effects will , of course , be larger at these altitudes , but significant flux is `` lensed '' near the star surface in the light curves meaning that the higher - order effects ( time - delay and kerr ) may also be significantly enhanced .",
    "modeling of such effects requires detailed treatment of the curved space , swept - back dipole field structure .",
    "we will describe such models in a future publication .",
