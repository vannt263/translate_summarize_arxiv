    "this effect is similar to the so - called circuit quantum electrodynamics which has been of great experimental interest recently  @xcite    next , we discuss briefly the non - markovian dynamics for charged qubits .      for charge qubits , the spectral density in eq .",

    ". furthermore , we found that the decoherence time of qubits can be two orders of magnitude larger than their typical low - frequency ohmic - regime , provided that the frequency of the qubit is about two times larger than the resonance frequency of the environmental resonance ( isolation circuit in the phase qubit case ) .",
    "we also studied the frequency renormalization ( shift ) of the qubit described by a two - level system due to dressing of the energy levels by the environmental degrees of freedom .",

    "lastly , we showed that when the qubit frequency is close to a resonance of the environment , the non - oscillatory markovian decay of the excited state population of the qubit , gives in to an oscillatory non - markovian decay , as the qubit and its environment self - generate rabi oscillations of characteristic time scales shorter than the decoherence time .",
