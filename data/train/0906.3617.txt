    "@xcite have observed that the k  shell electron capture ( @xmath1 ) decay rates of h  like @xmath2 and @xmath3 ions @xmath4 have an unexpected periodic time modulation of exponential decay curves .",
    "the rates of the number @xmath5 of daughter ions @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of the h  like mother ions @xmath2 or @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath10 is the @xmath1decay rate , are periodic functions , caused by a periodic time  dependence of the @xmath1decay rates @xmath11 with periods @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the @xmath1decays of @xmath14 or @xmath3 , respectively , amplitudes @xmath15 and phases @xmath16 .",
    "below such a periodic time ",
    "dependence we call the `` gsi oscillations '' .    recently @xcite@xcite the decay rate of the @xmath1decay @xmath17 with a period of the time  modulation @xmath18 has been observed . as has been pointed out in @xcite@xcite , the periods of the time ",
    "modulation of the h  like heavy ions obey the @xmath19-scaling : @xmath20 , where @xmath19 is a mass number of the mother h  like heavy ions .    in the articles @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) we have proposed an explanation of the periodic time ",
    "dependence of the @xmath1decay rates as an interference of two neutrino mass  eigenstates @xmath21 and @xmath22 with masses @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the period @xmath25 of the time ",
    "dependence has been related to the difference @xmath26 of the squared neutrino masses @xmath24 and @xmath23",
    "as follows @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy of the h  like mother ion with mass @xmath29 in the esr and @xmath30 is a lorentz factor @xcite . in a subsequent analysis",
    "we also showed that the @xmath31branches of the decaying h  like heavy ions do not show time modulation , because of the broad continuous energy spectrum of the neutrinos @xcite .",
    "this agrees well with the experimental data @xcite@xcite .",
    "according to the atomic quantum beat experiments and theory @xcite , the interpretation of the `` gsi oscillations '' , proposed in @xcite@xcite , bears similarity with quantum beats of atomic transitions , when an excited atomic eigenstate decays into a coherent state of two ( or several ) lower lying atomic eigenstates . in the case of the @xmath1decay",
    "one deals with a transition from the initial state @xmath32 to the final state @xmath33 , where the electron neutrino is a coherent superposition of two neutrino mass  eigenstates with the energy difference equal to @xmath34 related to @xmath35 as @xmath36 .    as has been pointed out in @xcite , a motion of the h  like mother ion in the magnetic field of the esr can be the origin of the `` gsi oscillations '' @xcite . in this letter",
    "we investigate the influence of the magnetic field of the esr at gsi making a consistent calculation of the @xmath1decay rate by using the weak interaction hamilton operator and taking into account a motion of the mother h  like ion in the magnetic field .",
    "for simplicity we approximate the magnetic field of the esr at gsi by a constant magnetic field @xmath37 directed perpendicular the plane of the esr .",
    "however , we neglect also a possible quantisation of the energy of the mother h  like in the constant magnetic field @xcite and take into account only the interaction of a spin of the mother h  like ion with a constant magnetic field .",
    "we show that such a spin  rotation coupling of the h  like heavy ions can not be responsible for the periodic time ",
    "dependence of the @xmath1decay rates , measured at gsi @xcite@xcite .",
    "the hamilton of the interaction of the h  like ions with a magnetic field @xmath38 we define as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are operators of spins of the electron and the mother nucleus with eigenvalues @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; @xmath44 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the bound electron with @xmath45 equal to @xcite@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 for the h  like heavy ion @xmath14 ; @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleus with spin @xmath50 and the mass . for the nucleus",
    "@xmath51 they are equal to @xmath52 @xcite and @xmath53",
    ". then , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the bohr and nuclear magnetons @xcite ; @xmath30 is a lorentz factor of a motion of a h  like heavy ion in the esr at gsi @xcite , the value of the magnetic field is @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the terms , proportional to @xmath57 , come from the thomas precession @xcite .",
    "the electric charges of the interacting particles are defined in terms of the electric charge of the proton @xmath58 .    for the calculation of the amplitude of the @xmath1decays @xmath59 of the mother",
    "h  like heavy ion @xmath60 we have to use a standard weak interaction hamilton operator @xmath61\\nonumber\\\\ \\hspace{-0.15in}&&\\times\\,[\\bar{\\psi}_{\\nu_e}(x ) \\gamma_{\\mu}(1 -   \\gamma^5)\\psi_e(x)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with standard notations @xcite .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite , the non  trivial contribution to the @xmath1decay rate of the h  like heavy ion in the ground @xmath62 comes from the state with the wave function @xmath63 .",
    "this means that the evolution of the h  like heavy ion into the state @xmath64 is defined by the wave function @xmath63 only .    in the laboratory frame",
    "the evolution of the mother h  like ion @xmath60 in time is described by the wave function @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are spinorial wave functions of the nucleus and the electron of the h  like heavy ion with eigenvalues @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the energies @xmath71 and @xmath72 are defined by @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the weak decay rate of the h  like mother ion in the laboratory frame @xcite , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the angles between the z  axis and the axes of quantisation of the spins of the electron and the nucleus , respectively . since in the gsi experiments the h  like heavy ions are in the @xmath78 , the spins of the electron and the nucleus should be anti  parallel .",
    "this implies that @xmath79 .    using the wave function @xmath80 the probability of finding a mother h  like heavy ion at time @xmath81 is @xmath82 where the frequency @xmath83 is equal to @xmath84\\nonumber\\\\ \\hspace{-0.3in}&&\\times \\mu_b b_0 = 1.34\\times 10^{11}\\,{\\rm s^{-1}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to the factor @xmath85 the dominant contribution comes from the electron anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "a period of the time modulation is equal to @xmath86 practically , the period @xmath87 is proportional to the electron mass .",
    "this disagrees with the experimental @xmath19scaling of the period of the time modulation of the h  like ions , measured at gsi @xcite@xcite .",
    "such a period of the time modulation can not be measured at the present level of the experimental time resolution at gsi @xcite .",
    "the probability @xmath88 should be averaged over the neutrino angular distribution , calculated in the laboratory frame and given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is an element of the solid angle in the momentum space with axial axis directed along the momentum @xmath91 of the mother ion .",
    "this gives @xmath92 as it is shown in fig.1 , the angle @xmath76 is related to angles @xmath93 and @xmath94 as follows @xmath95 . integrating over the azimuthal angle @xmath94 and using the integral representation bessel functions and the properties of infinite series of bessel functions",
