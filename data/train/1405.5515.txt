    "<S> we show that the many - body level statistics cross over from poisson to goe , and the localized eigenstates thermalize , with the crossover coupling decreasing with the size of the bath in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that an infinitesimally small coupling to a thermodynamic bath should destroy localization of the eigenstates . </S>",

    "<S> numerical investigations using exact diagonalization @xcite _ do _ indicate that all eigenstates of a strongly interacting disordered system can be localized . </S>",
    "<S> most of the theoretical research so far has been in the limit of a perfectly isolated system . </S>",
    "<S> however , experimental tests of mbl ( @xcite ) will always include some finite coupling to the environment . </S>",
    "<S> what then can we expect to see in experiments designed to probe many body localization ?    </S>",
    "<S> a recent theory of mbl systems weakly coupled to heat baths proposed that while eigenstates are delocalized by an infinitesimally weak coupling to a heat bath , signatures of localization persist in spectral functions of local operators for weak coupling to a bath @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this theory has yet to face stringent numerical tests . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it did not discuss the spectral functions of the physical degrees of freedom , the quantities of direct relevance for experiments , focusing instead on the spectral functions of certain localized integrals of motion that are believed to exist @xcite , but which are related to the physical degrees of freedom by an unknown unitary transformation . </S>",
    "<S> this work directly addresses these issues .        </S>",
    "<S> we use exact numerical diagonalization to establish the behavior of many body localized systems weakly coupled to heat baths . </S>",
    "<S> we show that coupling @xmath0 to a bath results in a crossover from poisson to gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) eigenvalue statistics , which becomes exponentially steeper with increasing bath size . a similar rapid crossover to thermalization is seen in the eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> however , the prospect for seeing mbl in experiments is still realistic because signatures of incomplete localization remain in the spectral functions of local ( in real space ) operators . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find that the spectral functions of the microscopic degrees of freedom look completely different in the localized and thermal phases ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . the thermal phase has a continuous spectrum whereas the local spectral function in the localized phase is discrete , with a hierarchy of gaps , and a gap at zero frequency that survives even after spatial averaging . </S>",
    "<S> increasing @xmath0 causes lines to broaden and fill in these gaps . </S>",
    "<S> however , as long as the typical line broadening is less than the largest gaps , gap - like features remain . </S>",

    "<S> we see that the line broadening increases and different lines start to overlap with each other , washing out the weaker spectral features , but larger gaps remain . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - frequency gap also fills in with increasing @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral functions retain signatures of localization even for @xmath113 when the eigenstates of the combined system and bath are effectively thermal , and get washed out when @xmath0 becomes comparable to the characteristic energy scales in the system ( i.e. @xmath114 ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the signatures of localization in a disordered system weakly coupled to a heat bath using exact diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions are found to exhibit a crossover to thermalization as a function of coupling to the bath . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover coupling is proportional to the many body level spacing in the bath , and vanishes exponentially fast in the limit of a large bath size . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the spectral functions of local operators are found to show more robust signatures of proximity to a localized phase . </S>",
    "<S> while the spectral functions are smooth and continuous in the delocalized phase ( after coarse graining on the scale of the many body level spacing ) , the spectral functions in the localized phase consist of narrow spectral lines , and contain a hierarchy of gaps , as well as a gap at zero frequency that persists even after spatial averaging . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the coupling to the bath increases the line broadening ( in a manner that we calculate ) and washes out these features . </S>",
    "<S> however , signatures of localization survive in the spectral functions even at couplings to the bath where the exact eigenstates are effectively thermal ( fig . </S>",
