    "properties of different types of networks have begun to attract the interest of statistical physicists .",
    "the spectrum of network related problems include , among many others , ordinary traffic in a city @xcite , distribution of nutrients in the vascular system @xcite , distribution of goods and wealth in economies , queuing problems on information networks @xcite , biochemical- and gene expression pathways @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized that most natural and man - made networks evolve in time and that their structure emerged as result of microscopic evolution rules @xcite . in many networks a scale - free linking structure",
    "was found @xcite which emerges from complex processes of self - organization with specific constraints .",
    "maybe the most prominent example of such a scale - free network is the world - wide web @xcite and the internet @xcite .",
    "transport processes on networks , such as traffic of information packets on the internet or diffusion of signaling molecules in a biological cell , are physical processes which are closely related to the network geometry .",
    "it is likely that biological networks have been optimized in structure by selections in evolution .",
    "the vast research on information traffic on technological networks is motivated to optimize network structure for practical reasons such as , e.g. , optimum connection strategies and information flow at minimal costs and risk .",
    "technological networks like the internet or the world - wide web are relatively easily accessible for empirical research in contrast to e.g. biological networks such as metabolic pathways .",
    "a further important motivation for studying networks is to gain theoretical insight in the role of an underlying geometry on the function of a network .",
    "recent empirical studies on internet traffic suggest a complex interplay of queuing behavior @xcite , temporal correlation in packet streams @xcite , and broad distributions of travel times of packets @xcite .",
    "moreover , evidence is gathered that both traffic parameters ( traffic intensity , buffer sizes , link capacities ) and network connectivity play a role in the overall network s performance .",
    "often two general regimes of traffic are recognized in networks : free flow and jammed traffic .",
    "a jamming transition is expected when traffic density exceeds a critical value .    in numerical work",
    "recently a model of packet transport was introduced @xcite which studies simultaneous random walks to specified destinations on scale - free networks .",
    "the results suggest that fat - tailed transit - time distributions and temporal correlations may occur for a wide range of values of packet densities as a consequence of network structure @xcite .",
    "other theoretical models were able to capture essential properties of the jamming transition on simple network geometries , like hierarchical trees @xcite and square lattice models @xcite .",
    "in this work we implement a general numerical model to study packet traffic on several classes of networks with diverse structural characteristics .",
    "these include a highly organized cyclic scale - free graph and two types of tree - like graphs . by working in a stationary traffic regime below the jamming transition ,",
    "our aim is to relate a given network topology to characteristic diffusion parameters such as probability distributions of travel times and packet velocities .",
    "further we want to quantitatively characterize the diffusion on given network topologies within a general framework of non - linear diffusion phenomena .    quite generally ,",
    "transport on networks can be seen as a diffusion on a geometry which is not plane- or space filling .",
    "diffusion on such topologies has been a matter of interest over the past decades .",
    "many problems like the diffusion of water particles in a sponge , or crude oil in porous media are phenomenologically well described by the anomalous diffusion equation .",
    "anomalous diffusion is naturally linked to power laws in the corresponding spatio - temporal probability distributions .",
    "it has been shown that the probability density which maximizes entropy of a version of a non - extensive entropy definition @xcite is an exact solution of the anomalous diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "it is part of this work to notice the connections between transport on networks and anomalous diffusion and to use the latter to quantify topology - dependence of network performance .",
    "queuing processes on networks are currently subject of intensive study .",
    "mathematically , being composed of many random processes , network queues are a natural laboratory to study limit stochastic processes .",
    "the existence of stable laws in these processes is expected @xcite .",
    "however , the connection between the character of the limit process and network structure remains an open theoretical problem . having numerically determined large series of transit - times of packets we also attempt to recognize their convergence to a stable law and explore the consequences of it on specific network topologies .    in section [ secii ]",
    "we specify the model of network diffusion and describe details of network structures and the implementation of diffusion rules .",
    "we determine conditions of the stationary ( un - jammed ) regime for all network topologies . in section [ seciii ]",
    "the results for transit - times distributions are presented in the stationary regime .",
    "we show results for the limit of infinitely low packet density on networks and discuss the statistical regularity of transit - timeseries .",
    "section [ seciv ] motivates the use of anomalous diffusion methods in network transport and contains the results of the velocity distributions on different networks . in section [ secv ]",
    "we study temporal correlations of workload timeseries and in section [ secvi ] we summarize and discuss the results .",
    "a fundamental problem in non - linear diffusion is to understand how the topological structure or the sparseness of space affects the dynamics that it supports .",
    "transport on a complex network with local navigation rules is a prototype for diffusion on a sparse structure .",
    "further reasons for non - linear terms in diffusion equations can be related to the diffusion process itself , i.e. , to the specific way of local navigation between individual nodes and queuing properties . in this work",
    "we introduce a numerical model in which we can control both , graph topology and microscopic diffusion details ( transport rules ) .",
    "we consider graphs with link structure that emerges from controlled microscopic linking rules , from which the graphs are grown .",
    "we grow three different types of networks ( described in detail below ) consisting of an equal number of nodes ( @xmath0 ) and links ( @xmath1 ) but having different linking patterns . after specifying the diffusion rules we monitor the _ simultaneous _ transport of packets on these graphs , and analyze local and statistical properties of the resulting traffic .",
    "a packet ( particle ) carries information from the node where it is created to an in - advance specified node ( address ) on the network .",
    "these can be , for instance , a piece of information transported on the internet or a protein in a biological cell .      to determine how the structure of links in the network influences diffusion , we study three topologies with emergent link structures .",
    "their main structural characteristics are the following : ( i ) scale - free directed graph with closed cycles ( cyclic web graph , wg ) ; ( ii ) scale - free graph with no closed cycles ( scale - free tree , sf ) ; and ( iii ) absence of a scale - free structure and absence of closed cycles ( randomly grown tree , rg ) .    for all cases we stop growth of the graph when @xmath2 nodes and links have been added .",
    "all the graphs that we consider have the same number of nodes and links , they differ in the adjacency matrix . after growing the network , the corresponding adjacency matrix is not changed during the diffusion processes .",
    "we first consider the scale - free cyclic graph ( wg ) shown in fig .",
    "[ figgraph]a .",
    "such a graph is grown by adjusting a single free parameter governing microscopic linking rules proposed in @xcite .",
    "these rules have been suggested as an evolution model of the world - wide web .",
    "the minimal set of rules consists of : _ growth _ by adding of a new node at each time step and _ attachment _ ( with probability @xmath3 ) of the new node to a pre - existing node , or _ rewiring _",
    "( with probability @xmath4 ) of a pre - existing node .",
    "each link is oriented originating from a node , @xmath5 , as an out - going link , and pointing to another node , @xmath6 , where it is seen as in - coming link . in the model",
    "@xcite both the target node @xmath6 and and the origin @xmath5 of a link are selected by shifted preferential probabilities given by @xmath7 which depend on the number of respective in - coming links @xmath8 , and out - going links @xmath9 at current time @xmath10 .",
    "the shift parameter @xmath11 is the initial probability , where @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the average number of links _ added _ per time step . as shown in @xcite",
    "the biased attachment and rewiring in the growth rules lead to a scale - free organization of both in- and in out - links with the local connectivity at node @xmath14 at time @xmath10 building up in time with a power - law @xmath15 \\ ; q_{out } ( s , t ) = a_2\\left[\\left(t / s\\right)^{\\gamma _ { out } }    -b_2 \\right ] \\label{local_connectivity}\\ ] ] where the scaling exponents are @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . the power - law growth of the local connectivity in eq .",
    "( [ local_connectivity ] ) ensures an emergent scale - free structure of the graph after long evolution time . the global graph structure at @xmath18",
    "is thus characterized by the power - law distributions of links @xcite , @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "here we use the original one - parameter model @xcite with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . apart from the scale - free organization of in- and out - links ,",
    "the emergent graph structure is characterized by the occurrence of closed cycles of directed links and a single giant connected component .",
    "two types of hubs ( nodes with a large in - link and nodes with a large out - link connectivity ) appear together with a substantial degree of correlations between local in- and out - connectivity @xcite .",
    "recent analysis of empirical data on the structure of the internet @xcite reveal similar topological properties on the level of routers .",
    "this type of graph topology has also importance in biological scale - free networks ( metabolic networks ) @xcite , where the presence of closed cycles enables feedback regulation . as a further example we mention gene co - regulation networks @xcite .",
    "after a gene is expressed its product molecules ( mrna or proteins ) are in part addressed to specific genes in the network where they bind and regulate the expression of the other genes .",
    "another biological network which shares some characteristics of the wg is the cell crawling network , where cells move along dynamic paths traced by previous cells @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig_spectra ] correlators @xmath25 and power - spectra @xmath26 are shown for stationary flow at @xmath27 for the three graph topologies and diffusion rules .",
    "the corresponding scaling exponents have been obtained by least square fits to the data .",
    "results are found in table [ tab_fits ] .",
    "for rd both @xmath11 and @xmath28 suggest practically uncorrelated workload processes , regardless of the network type .",
    "the situation changes for cs where signs for anti - persistence are found in the sf ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and especially in the wg ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 )",
    ".    observed anti - persistence ( @xmath33 ) may be related to some kind of regulatory effects due to powerful hubs in the structured networks .",
    "as discussed above , the advanced search often directs packets via hub nodes , and even for low global workload , there can emerge long queues at large hub nodes .",
    "while waiting in a queue , packets increase the network s workload , but they do not contribute to randomness of the process .",
    "moreover , when a waiting packet is on turn to be processed , it gets quickly to the target ( which is often found in the neighborhood of that hub ) and disappears from the traffic ; in other words , the system corrects itself by quickly decreasing the workload .",
    "connected with this scenario is the fact that networks with more powerful hubs , such as the wg , are more efficient than networks with only one hub ( e.g. sf ) or no hubs at all ( e.g. rg ) .",
    "in this work by use of large - scale numerical simulations and theoretical concepts we demonstrated how packet transport between nodes on different structured networks can be quantified as an anomalous diffusion process . in our model",
    "we control both graph topology and microscopic diffusion rules .",
    "our main aim was to explore how topology of graphs affects properties of the diffusion process .",
    "for this purpose we ensured a stationary un - jammed flow on each graph topology by an externally fixed posting rate @xmath34 .",
    "we based our work primarily on the analysis of transit - times of packets .",
    "we find power - laws in the transit - time distributions which imply non - negligible probabilities for very long delays .",
    "we find a marked difference in power - law exponents depending on graph topology and search algorithm .",
    "these power - laws are rather independent of the posting rate , suggesting a statistical regularity of the diffusion process that can be related to graph topology when below the jamming transition . for the range of posting rates studied ,",
    "we find that the particular queuing discipline is of minor importance .",
    "the type of queuing is known to play a more important role for larger posting rates where waiting - times of packets increase when approaching the jamming transition .",
    "our main conclusions which characterize the diffusion process on structured networks can be summarized in the following points :      we have demonstrated that the traffic of packets on structured networks can be made stationary without imposing any global constraint .",
    "we find the stationary jammed flow for a range of values for the posting rate which balances the output rate ( number of packets delivered per time step ) .",
    "the output rate strictly depends on the network s topology and the search algorithm to navigate packets .",
    "generally , for local search algorithms more structured networks , e.g. , networks with more powerful hubs and closed cycles have larger output rates .",
    "theoretically , the stationarity of the traffic guarantees that we are dealing with self - similar stochastic processes , which have major advantages for theoretical analysis ( scaling ) .",
    "we found that the traffic of information packets is super - diffusive on any non - trivial graph topology ( emergent topologies in evolving networks ) . in formal terms , this means that distances between nodes in a large graph can be traversed in times that scale sub - quadratically with the graph size ( the dynamic exponent @xmath35 is @xmath36 ) .",
    "this conclusion remains true even if packets are left to diffuse randomly .",
    "this is in marked contrast to random diffusion on space - filling structures , where random diffusion is represented by brownian motion .",
    "another finding is that in the free - flow regime , differences between graph topologies are marginal when packets diffuse randomly .",
    "this underlines the necessity for improving and adapting local diffusion rules in order to optimally use the topology of an underlying graph . to this end",
    "we studied transport with the improved local search algorithm which looks for the destination node in next - near - neighbor surrounding of the node .",
    "when using the improved local search , transport remains super - diffusive but marked quantitative differences due to graph topologies emerge .",
    "the improved local search in combination with some network topologies performs strikingly more efficient than for others .",
    "this is especially true for highly structured networks .",
    "the efficiency of the network with improved local search is directly related to regulatory effects played by large hub nodes , in particular by the number of hubs and the number of closed cycles . although the distributions of transit - times of packets in all structured networks are markedly different ( generally shorter times in highly structured networks ) , they still exhibit power - tails",
    ".    the optimum strategy for diffusion on a network would be the knowledge of the shortest paths between the initial point and its destination .",
    "this knowledge would however require costly global navigation , which is often not available in real networks .",
    "traffic along geodesics may also be inconvenient in the case of queuing , given that in the scale - free graphs a majority of shortest paths pass through hub nodes , while other nodes carry much less traffic .",
    "to understand this better we mention that the probability distribution of the number of paths through a node is a fast decaying function @xmath37 in sf and @xmath38 in wg @xcite . an advanced local search such as",
    "cs is certainly better in this respect , since it disperses the activity over more nodes in the network .",
    "this is achieved through the random part of the search , i.e. , when the destination node appears not to be in the locally searched nnn area .",
    "this feature of the local search implies , however , that some packets may get stuck in remote areas of the network , leading to the long tail in the transit - time distribution .    to improve search algorithms on structured graphs without extending their local character one can think of a statistical improvement which might be realized in many natural systems . to this end one",
    "sends multiple copies of the same packet to the same destination .",
    "since all packets move independently and randomly there would be differences between path lengths selected by the different copies .",
    "we monitor the shortest transit - time and ignore later arrivals .",
    "the first - arrival statistics of multiple copies of the packet is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_minpath ] .",
    "it shows that a reasonable improvement is achieved already by sending ten copies of the packet .",
    "statistically , the fastest arriving packets use the minimum path up to four - link separation and longest transit - times are reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the one - copy case .",
    "the asymptotic tail has the slope close to 1.9 .",
    "similar effects  reduced transit - times by first arrivals  are found in the other two graph topologies , with the slope of the curve practically unchanged , compared to the one - packet distribution .",
    "the efficiency of information transport on biological networks ",
    "e.g. , signaling molecules sent by a node to a particular destination where they can bind chemically  probably utilizes the above statistical methods for improvement .",
    "many identical molecules are being sent from an area of production ( e.g. the nucleus ) to a target position via a network ( cytosceleton).the first arriving molecule binds and chemically acts on the target node . in technological networks",
    "the statistical improvement method may be used in low density traffic .",
    "for instance , in the stationary flow regime on the web graph with cs at rate @xmath39 one can copy each packet by a factor of ten without yet causing jamming on the network . other topologies are more sensitive to jamming and the number of copies needs to be adjusted to the basic driving rate @xmath34 .",
    "maybe our most interesting result is that in several measures ( transit - times , @xmath40 and correlation exponents ) we found that neither graph topology nor the search algorithm alone are sufficient to explain for a drastic increase of efficiency of network traffic .",
    "we rather find that the combination of both  in form of a good matching ",
    "are the source of this improvement .",
    "it is most intriguing that for ordinary diffusion very little dependence of network structure was found , meaning for a unguided diffusion no advantage from more structure in a network is gained .",
    "in other words either the structure of the network should be adjusted to the processes that the network supports , or the network has to be formed to use these processes most effectively . with this finding it becomes possible to speculate that evolution has adopted certain network structures in nature to cheap and robust search mechanisms , and/or has adapted search strategies to existing networks ."
