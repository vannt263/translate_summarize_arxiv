    "[ sec : intro ] helium reionization is an important epoch in the universe s history , and the most recent large - scale transition of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . during the epoch of hydrogen reionization , the first stars and galaxies emitted photons capable of ionizing hydrogen and singly ionizing helium ( whose ionization energies are 13.6 and 24.6 ev , respectively ) .",
    "however , the spectra of these first sources did not contain a sufficient number of high - energy photons capable of doubly ionizing helium , which requires a much larger ionization energy ( 54.4 ev ) .",
    "consequently , helium was predominantly singly ionized following hydrogen reionization until a burst of quasar activity at redshifts @xmath5 .",
    "quasars are thought to be the first objects to emit an appreciable number of photons capable of doubly ionizing helium .",
    "however , because the birth of quasars requires additional time for structure to form and sufficient mass to assemble inside of dark matter halos , this period of evolution occurs later in the universe s history .",
    "recent and upcoming efforts to look for quasars include the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) of sdss - iii @xcite , the hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 @xcite , the hyper suprime cam ( hsc ) of the subaru telescope @xcite , and desi @xcite .",
    "there are currently about 200,000 quasars cataloged , with this number projected to increase by an order of magnitude after the conclusion of the next generation of experiments .",
    "this rich set of observations allows us to characterize quasars to an unprecedented level of accuracy , and better characterize their properties .",
    "this is especially true at high redshift ( @xmath6 ) , where there are currently few observations .",
    "determining quasar properties at high redshifts is helpful for understanding the growth of structure , as well as helping to understand reionization through measuring their absorption spectra .",
    "observations have shown that quasar activity peaks between @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "observations of the gunn - peterson trough for helium have been detected at @xmath8 @xcite , implying that some fraction of helium was still present as heii at these redshifts .",
    "helium absorption then transitions to becoming patchy , with extended regions of absorption and transmission in the heii lyman-@xmath1 forest @xcite , and seems to be completed by @xmath9 @xcite , which coincides with the peak in quasar activity .",
    "however , to observe the gunn - peterson trough of heii , the sight line must be free of any intervening lyman - limit systems .",
    "this means that the number of observations for these measurements is rather small ( of @xmath10 ) .",
    "when discussing helium reionization , it is important to understand the properties of the ionization sources , such as quasars lifetimes and light curves . on the theoretical side of the problem , there are some predictions for quasar properties , but also a fair degree of uncertainty . by treating quasars as accretion disks around super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) , one can show that the maximal conversion efficiency @xmath11 for converting mass to luminosity is @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "further , for matter accreting onto a smbh at the eddington limit , one obtains an exponential increase in mass and luminosity with a characteristic time scale ( called the salpeter @xmath13-folding time ) of @xmath14 myr for @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations that seek to capture the relationship between quasars and their galaxy hosts have treated quasar activity as being the result of a major - merger event between two galaxies @xcite , or a cold - flow accretion of gas onto the central smbh @xcite . however , there is no definitive evidence that quasars accrete exclusively at the eddington limit , or are limited to a single episode of highly luminous activity .",
    "observations can also help us understand the physics of quasars , though typically at larger scales than theory or simulation . since the entire episode of helium reionization spans a time of roughly 10@xmath16 years , the quasar lifetime must be shorter than this @xcite . at the other extreme ,",
    "observations of the quasar proximity zone show that quasar lifetimes should be at least 10@xmath17 years @xcite .",
    "further constraints are difficult to observe directly , and usually rely on indirect methods such as quasar clustering measurements ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "measurements made using these methods yield values for the quasar lifetime that are 10 - 100 myr , with most values being @xmath1830 myr , which is comparable to the salpeter @xmath13-folding time .",
    "further , there are few definitive constraints on quasar light curves ( though see @xcite ) .    for the universal populations of quasars , the major pieces of data",
    "are their number density as a function of luminosity and redshift ( _ i.e. _ , the quasar luminosity function @xmath19 , @xcite ) , and their spatial clustering @xcite .",
    "these observations can constrain scaling relations between quasars and their hosts ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , or used to calibrate subgrid models for simulations ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . however , as mentioned above , the properties of individual quasars are difficult to extract from these observations , due to degeneracies .",
    "the imposed constraints are typically weak , and only provide order - of - magnitude precision .",
    "cosmological simulations are an ideal tool for furthering our knowledge about this portion of the universe s history .",
    "helium reionization leaves a lasting impression on the thermal history of the igm : the relative hardness of quasar spectra means that there is a large degree of photoheating of the igm while reionization is occurring .",
    "thus , it is important to include hydrodynamics in simulations , in order to include the effects of baryonic physics .",
    "additionally , due to the relatively long mean free path of far - uv and soft x - ray photons when looking at helium reionization , it becomes important to include radiative transfer calculations in simulations .",
    "thus , semi - analytic calculations that assume a sharp reionization front are typically poor approximations of the physical situation .",
    "even 1d radiative transfer codes are not realistic enough to calculate the inhomogeneous reionization process , especially when reionization regions begin to overlap . due to the highly biased nature of quasar sources , this is typically early in the reionization process .",
    "therefore , 3d radiative transfer calculations are essential for capturing the complicated physics of helium reionization .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the large degree of thermal heating argues for simulations in which the hydrodynamics calculations are coupled to the radiative transfer ones .",
    "this work builds on and extends previous investigations of helium reionization , which either were semi - numerical @xcite or applied radiative transfer in post processing @xcite .",
    "our approach to helium reionization uses simulations , with @xmath0-body , hydrodynamics , and radiative transfer solved simultaneously .",
    "an essential first step of this calculation is to understand the sources of reionization , and ensure that their properties match the observations as nearly as possible .",
    "to this end , we use the observed quasar luminosity function from sdss dr9 @xcite and the clustering measurements from boss @xcite to inform the properties of individual quasars for our simulation input . by using these two constraints , as well as a formalism for populating dark matter halos with quasars",
    "that we will outline below , we are able to select quasars that agree well with the latest observational constraints . specifically , matching the quasar luminosity function",
    "means that we have an observationally accurate number of ionization sources , and matching the clustering measurements means our topology of reionization ( _ e.g. _ , the size and overlap of reionized regions ) will be similar to the actual reionization process .",
    "the clustering can also have an effect on the spatial correlations present in the radiation field , which can affect the bao measurement from the lyman-@xmath1 forest .",
    "this first paper of the series discusses the way in which we create sources for our simulations of helium reionization . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pop ] , we describe our simulation strategy , and how we construct a quasar catalog from an @xmath0-body halo catalog . in sec .",
    "[ sec : clustering ] , we explain how we modify our quasar properties in order to match recent observations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we explore implications of our findings for quasar populations . in sec .  [",
    "sec : reion ] , we discuss implications for helium reionization . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize our presentation and lay out future directions . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume a @xmath20cdm cosmology with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . these values are consistent with the _",
    "wmap_-9 year results @xcite .",
    "when modeling helium reionization , we employ the radhydro code , which includes @xmath0-body , hydrodynamics , and radiative transfer calculations simultaneously .",
    "the code includes a particle mesh ( pm ) solver for gravity calculations , a fixed - grid eulerian code for solving hydrodynamics , and radiative transfer solved by performing ray - tracing . for more details on the hydrodynamics portion of the simulation code ,",
    "see @xcite . for more details regarding the radhydro code and its application to hydrogen reionization ,",
    "see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the simulation strategy we employ for our exploration of helium reionization consists of two steps .",
    "first , a high - resolution @xmath0-body simulation is run for a given set of initial conditions .",
    "halos are found on - the - fly using the friend - of - friends algorithm , and a corresponding catalog of spherical overdensity halos are saved at even steps in cosmological time ( trac et al .",
    "2015 ) . then , using the same initial conditions , a medium - resolution simulation using the radhydro code is run . in order to provide accurate sources of ionizing photons for the radiative transfer calculations ,",
    "it is necessary to convert the halo catalogs produced from the first simulation into quasar catalogs for the second simulation .",
    "since the resolution of the radhydro sims is comparatively low ( typically a hydro grid unit is 10 - 100 kpc @xmath3 ) , the simulations are not able to accurately capture the subgrid , galaxy - level physics to include quasars directly .",
    "thus , either a halo - level scaling relation or observational constraint is needed in order to create a physically reliable sample . rather than having to rely on scaling relations that require several steps to convert between halo mass and quasar luminosity , we use abundance matching to calculate luminosity as a function of mass , and then use observations to create a population with the proper characteristics .    in order to calibrate the proper quasar properties to use , a suite of 10 @xmath0-body p@xmath27 m simulations with @xmath28  gpc  @xmath3 and @xmath29 dark matter particles were run , which corresponds to a particle mass of @xmath30 .",
    "the total volume is thus 10 ( gpc @xmath3)@xmath27 ; the boss measurement of the two - point correlation function in @xcite has an effective volume of 9.8 ( gpc @xmath3)@xmath27 , so the volumes are comparable .",
    "then halo finding was performed which produced the associated halo catalog snapshot every 20 myr between @xmath31 .",
    "since only comparatively massive halos serve as hosts for the bright quasars of interest , the simulations have a sufficient resolution to capture the required number of halos .      the first step in our model construction",
    "is to define the properties of individual quasars .",
    "the two most important of these are the light curve ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath32 ) and the quasar lifetime .",
    "the most common model found in the literature for the light curve of quasars is the so - called lightbulb model , in which a quasar emits radiation at a constant luminosity for a lifetime @xmath33 before turning off .",
    "though largely unphysical , this model has the convenience of being simple to model and implement in calculations .",
    "a further simplification is typically made in which it is assumed that @xmath33 is independent of luminosity , so that this quantity becomes a universal property .",
    "a more realistic model of the light curve is to assume an exponential form .",
    "this type of model can be motivated physically by noting that it corresponds to eddington accretion onto the central supermassive black hole .",
    "several variations on this version include an exponential ramp - up to some peak luminosity followed by abrupt turn off , a symmetric exponential about some peak luminosity , or an exponential ramp - up with a power - law fall off in luminosity @xcite .",
    "while these models are more physically motivated , they are slightly more complicated .",
    "the approach we outline below is able to reproduce a given luminosity function for quasars of this form .",
    "specifically , we consider here two classes of quasar light curves : the `` lightbulb '' model and `` exponential '' model , defined as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the heaviside theta function and @xmath36 is the time when the quasar reaches its peak luminosity @xmath37 . in the exponential case , the parameter @xmath38 can be treated as a free parameter in a manner analogous to @xmath33 in the lightbulb case .",
    "nevertheless , we relate @xmath38 to @xmath33 , which we will describe in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : am ] .",
    "another consideration is the quasar lifetime itself , which in general need not be a universal property of all quasars .",
    "we have parameterized quasar lifetime as a function of luminosity using a power law form : @xmath39 where we vary the values of @xmath36 and @xmath40 .",
    "we explore models in which @xmath41 yr , and @xmath42 . positive values of @xmath40 imply that brighter quasars have longer lifetimes compared to dimmer ones , and @xmath43 is the case of a universal lifetime for all quasars .",
    "we have discussed considerations for the individual quasars ( _ i.e. _ , light curves and lifetimes ) , and we wish to connect them to the universal quasar population ( _ i.e. _ , the qlf ) . in order to do so , we use the concept of a triggering rate @xmath44 , which dictates the differential number density of quasars that reach their peak luminosity @xmath37 as a function of luminosity and redshift per unit logarithmic luminosity . using the formalism outlined in @xcite ,",
    "we distinguish between the peak luminosity of a quasar @xmath37 and the instantaneous luminosity at which it is measured for the construction of the qlf @xmath45 , and relate the two with the triggering rate @xmath46 .",
    "essentially , the triggering rate must be convolved with the light curve of the quasars , since the measured luminosity function reflects a given quasar s current luminosity @xmath45 rather than its intrinsic peak luminosity @xmath37 .",
    "the result of this convolution is the observed quasar luminosity function from the intrinsic triggering rate : @xmath47 as explained in @xcite , @xmath48 is the quasar luminosity function ( _ i.e. _ , the comoving number density of quasars per logarithmic bin in luminosity ) , and the quantity @xmath49 is the amount of time that a quasar spends in a logarithmic luminosity bin .",
    "essentially , the triggering rate can be thought of as analogous to the halo mass function , though with the light curve convolution to account for changes in quasar brightness . in simple cases of the light curve the triggering rate can be solved for analytically : for a lightbulb model , @xmath49 is a delta function at @xmath50 , and so the triggering rate is proportional to the quasar luminosity function : @xmath51 in the case of an exponential light curve as defined in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : exp ] ) , we have @xmath52 where the factor of 2 arises because a quasar will be observed at a luminosity @xmath45 while its luminosity is increasing and then decreasing . in practice ,",
    "the qlf is typically reported in magnitude units rather than luminosity .",
    "specifically , we convert quasar luminosity to the corresponding absolute @xmath53-band magnitude at @xmath54 using the relation given by @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath45 is the quasar luminosity in erg / s .",
    "( [ eqn : ndot ] ) is soluble for a few classes of light curves , such as the ones explored here .",
    "however , providing a general solution for this equation is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the technique of abundance matching has already been applied to populations of galaxies with great success @xcite , and has also been discussed in the context of quasars @xcite .",
    "however , we wish to extend the techniques mentioned above to include different quasar light curves and lifetimes .",
    "the methods we outline below are also fairly general , and can be extended to include semi - analytic models as well .",
    "we start with the _ ansatz _ for abundance matching of galaxies , namely that the most luminous galaxies are found in the most massive halos .",
    "this makes intuitive sense : more massive halos have more dark matter and baryonic matter to eventually convert to stars .",
    "specifically , halo mass is highly correlated to the luminosity in the red bands , which shows the percentage of older stellar mass .    for quasars , we have a similar situation where the most luminous quasars are found in the most massive halos .",
    "however , in this case the situation is slightly more complicated because quasars have a lifetime which is much shorter than the period from the halo s formation to the activation of the quasar .",
    "thus , we need to introduce a factor to account for the fact that not all halos host an active quasar .",
    "if we assume that the fraction of halos hosting an active quasar is universal ( _ i.e. _ , independent of halo mass or quasar luminosity ) , we can express abundance matching for quasars , assuming a lightbulb light curve , as : @xmath56 expressed this way , @xmath57 is simply the fraction of halos of a mass @xmath58 that host an active quasar .",
    "alternatively , we could define this fraction in terms of the quasar lifetime : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the hubble time in our @xmath20cdm cosmology . for the redshifts of interest , for a uniform value of @xmath61 myr",
    ", this implies that @xmath62 .",
    "we can generalize the procedure of abundance matching to different light curves by using the triggering rate .",
    "in integral form , we can write abundance matching as equating the cumulative number of quasars above a particular peak luminosity given by the triggering rate with the cumulative number of halos given by the halo mass function . the total number of halos which should host quasars within a time interval @xmath63 is : @xmath64 this form of our abundance matching equation becomes the central mechanism by which we are able to equate quasar luminosity with host halo mass . in this construction",
    ", we have implicitly used the mass to light ratio @xmath65 to convert halo mass to quasar luminosity .",
    "additionally , we have introduced the factor @xmath66 to represent the probability that an individual halo will host a quasar .",
    "we have set this quantity to be equal to @xmath67 .",
    "thus , for the case of a lightbulb light curve and a universal quasar lifetime , this formalism reduces to eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : amcum ] ) .    in the exponential case , we are free to choose the parameter @xmath38 in any way that we like , as long as it is constant with respect to @xmath45 ( thought it may vary with @xmath37 ) . we have chosen @xmath38 such that @xmath68 is the same between the lightbulb and exponential cases for all luminosities .",
    "we accomplish this by equating eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : ndotlb ] ) and eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : ndotexp ] ) , and solving for @xmath38 in terms of @xmath33 .",
    "the expression involves the ratio of the quasar luminosity function and its derivative .",
    "this means that when we perform abundance matching , the same implicit mass - to - light ratio is used in the two cases .",
    "since the halo mass function is the same between the two cases ( due to the same population of halos being used ) , and the functional form of @xmath46 is the same , we must have the same form of @xmath65 .",
    "this has the advantage of allowing us to apply certain intuition from the lightbulb case to the less straightforward exponential case .",
    "the downside to this approach is that when exploring the parameter space of quasar lifetimes @xmath33 in the lightbulb case , it is not immediately obvious how this translates to the exponential time constant @xmath38 , since we effectively have different values of @xmath33 for different luminosities . for instance , even in cases where @xmath33 is independent of luminosity , @xmath38 still changes as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "however , the benefits of being able to interpret the results of the exponential case using the intuition provided by the lightbulb case outweigh the downsides of not exploring parameters in @xmath38 directly .",
    "the general procedure is thus .    1 .",
    "the halo mass found from the halo catalog at redshift @xmath69 is read and converted to an expected number density in a particular cosmology using the universal mass function described in @xcite .",
    "the fitted form of the mass function is used rather than the empirical one from the catalog in order to decrease the variation in number density at the high - mass end , since these quasars are disproportionately important for the reionization process .",
    "2 .   using eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : am ] ) , the halo number density is converted to an expected quasar number density using a specified quasar luminosity function .",
    "the quasar magnitudes are binned into equal intervals in magnitude @xmath70 , such that the expected triggering rate @xmath71 is found , which is converted from a number density to a total number using the volume of the simulations .",
    "4 .   within each magnitude bin",
    ", each quasar is assumed to have an equal probability of becoming active .",
    "each quasar candidate is randomly turned on with probability @xmath72 .",
    "5 .   to ensure that the volume self - consistently follows the merging of the underlying host halos ,",
    "the quasars are propagated forward using a halo merger tree .",
    "when two progenitor halos merge into a single descendent and one of them is hosting an active quasar , the descendent halo inherits the active quasar . if a single active progenitor halo splits to form two descendent halos , the larger halo retains the quasar . in the case of a merger between two active quasar halos , only the larger quasar survives .",
    "further , if a halo is hosting a quasar still active from a previous time step , it is not eligible to host one in the current snapshot .",
    "these cases represent a comparatively few number of instances of our total population evolution , and do not strongly influence our conclusions .    throughout this work ,",
    "we use the quasar luminosity function as determined by @xcite from the boss survey , specifically the high-@xmath73 stripe 82 sample ( s82 ) form which includes luminosity evolution and density evolution ( lede ) .",
    "the lede model is one where the break luminosity and overall amplitude both change with redshift .",
    "although nominally this fit is only valid between @xmath74 , we use it over the entire redshift range for interest @xmath75 .",
    "the reason for this is that at high redshift ( @xmath76 ) , there are few quasars , and the constraints on the luminosity function are not very strong . at the low end of the redshift range , @xcite prefer a model with a pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) , where only the amplitude of the qlf changes with redshift .",
    "however the intended application , modeling helium reionization , is largely finished by @xmath77 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : intro ] ) , making the transition between luminosity functions unimportant .",
    "furthermore there is not a significant difference between the lede and ple models at @xmath78 .",
    "figure  [ fig : qlf ] shows the quasar luminosity function from @xcite , used as the target luminosity function in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : ndot ] ) , as well as two different quasar models at @xmath79 .",
    "we can see that there is generally very good agreement between the constructed quasar catalog and the target luminosity function , as should be expected .",
    "the differences between the constructed catalogs and target luminosity function are typically on average @xmath80 , which is comparable to or smaller than the uncertainties in the luminosity function itself at these redshifts . at high luminosities ( @xmath81 ) , though , there are some comparatively large differences that can arise between the predicted and empirical luminosity functions .",
    "this deviation is largely due to poisson shot - noise introduced by the rarity of the objects . for objects in this luminosity range ,",
    "there are typically only a few objects ( @xmath10 ) in the entire 1 ( gpc  @xmath3)@xmath27 volume . at the dim end of the quasar luminosity function",
    ", there can be insufficient halos of a particular mass given the mass resolution of our simulation .",

    "the first four of these models have particularly good agreement with the boss measurements .",

    "we summarize these models in table  [ table : models ] .",
    "by construction , our method matches the input quasar luminosity function at all redshifts , regardless of the individual properties of the underlying quasar population . however , we are not guaranteed to match the observed clustering of quasars . changing the implicit mass - to - light ratio of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : am ] ) through changing the quasar lifetimes will affect how halos are populated with quasars .",
    "in general , longer quasar lifetimes lead to quasars of the same luminosity being matched into hosts of larger masses .",

    "this means that , included in the sample of quasars chosen for the clustering measurements , there are high - mass hosts chosen whose quasars are not at their peak luminosity . since these hosts have a bias larger than the value preferred by the boss measurements , this sample must necessarily include hosts which have a smaller clustering signal , so that on average , the total bias agrees with boss .",

    "however , there does seem to be a trend emerging : in the lightbulb case , for more negative values of @xmath40 , the bias is larger , with the opposite trend for the exponential case . in the lightbulb case , this can be explained by noting , as in sec .  [ sec : chi2 ] , that in abundance matching longer lifetimes leads to a larger bias in the host halos . for negative values of @xmath40 , less luminous quasars have longer lifetimes .",

    "brighter quasars have longer lifetimes , and are more likely to be included in the low - luminosity selection .",
    "since these hosts are abundance matched to occupy more massive , more clustered halo hosts , this leads to a stronger clustering signal , and a larger value of @xmath189 .",
    "the evolution is not as strong as in the lightbulb case , however . in principle , the clustering measurement in different luminosity ranges could help break the degeneracy of best - fit models .    unfortunately , in practice this type of measurement might be difficult to actually make .",
    "the change in bias between the extreme values of @xmath40 is not very significant , and the measurement is very noisy .",
    "the shaded gray region in figure  [ fig : lum ] shows the current 1@xmath94 bounds from the boss measurement , which has a larger spread than the variation in @xmath189 as a function of @xmath40 .",
