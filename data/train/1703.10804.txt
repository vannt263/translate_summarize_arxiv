    "with the rapid growth of wireless terminals and the development of mobile internet technology , the amount of traffic data in mobile cellular networks increases exponentially .",
    "global mobile data traffic grew 81 percent in 2013 and will upsurge nearly 11-fold from 2013 and 2018 according to a forecast by cisco @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , because of the convergence of user behavior , the traffic distribution exhibits a strong inhomogeneous character .",
    "for example , the total traffic in dense urban area is greatly larger than that in rural areas .",
    "the traffic demand in a stadium will surge if there is a football game . in @xcite ,",
    "the concept of group users behavior ( gub ) is proposed to describe the user behavior regularity in a group at a certain time and area .",
    "gub has great impact on both the temporal and spatial traffic distributions .",
    "therefore , the modeling of traffic patterns in different domains is of great importance for the analysis and optimization of mobile cellular networks .",
    "traffic volume in an area changes with time periodically which results in low traffic period and high traffic period .",
    "this is the main characteristic of traffic volume in time domain .",
    "various models have been used for the theoretical analysis of traffic variation in cellular networks . in @xcite ,",
    "the traffic profile is modeled as a periodic sinusoidal profile .",
    "it obtains the traffic profile under different loads by changing the mean and variance parameters of the sinusoidal function .",
    "this model is further modified to make it more practical in @xcite@xcite by adding a poisson distributed random process to model the random fluctuations of the total traffic . in @xcite , a trapezoidal model exploiting the family of symmetric trapezoidal curves",
    "is proposed to model the daily traffic pattern with maximum equal to 1 at the peak hour and different slopes .",
    "all these models are ideal and simplified for the tractability of theoretical analysis .",
    "there still exists a big gap between these theoretical models and real traffic data .    in spatial domain",
    ", various models also have been developed to describe the inhomogeneity of traffic distribution .",
    "homogeneous spatial poisson point process ( sppp ) and k - tier sppp are simple and widely used distribution models for modeling of base stations location and users location in heterogeneous network @xcite@xcite .",
    "although sppp model can reflect the randomness of distribution , it can not describe the convergence of user behavior and traffic . in @xcite ,",
    "lognormal distribution model is utilized for modeling the traffic of urban area .",
    "the authors in @xcite concluded that the traffic density follows exponential distribution by analyzing the traffic data in lisbon and portugal .",
    "they find that the traffic density decreases exponentially with the increase of distance from the central urban area . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors utilize 2-dimentianal gaussian model for approximation of the user distribution in cellular networks .",
    "this model can generate various user distributions such as uniform distribution and hotspot clusters by adapting the parameters : the mean values and the standard deviations .    in this paper ,",
    "firstly the real traffic data in a big city of china is analyzed to build traffic models of multiple base stations in temporal and spatial domain , then a combined spatial - temporal traffic modeling method is proposed for describing the traffic pattern of single base station .",
    "the parameters of proposed models in typical regions are presented .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "a sinusoid superposition model is proposed for modeling the temporal traffic variation of multiple base stations in a given area based on real data from current cellular network .",
    "the main frequency components of traffic variation are presented .",
    "these components are related to user behavior .",
    "lognormal distribution is verified for spatial traffic modeling by comparing with the distribution of real traffic data .",
    "the spatial traffic distributions at both spare time and busy time are studied .",
    "the parameters of lognormal distribution in three typical regions including park , campus and central business district ( cbd ) are presented .",
    "a spatial - temporal traffic modeling approach for generating traffic data of single base station is proposed based on the previous temporal and spatial traffic models .",
    "this model reflects both the randomness and periodicity of single base station s traffic pattern .",
    "the applications of this model may include capacity estimates , energy efficient design and other system analysis .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "time ] , a sinusoid superposition model is proposed for temporal traffic modeling of multiple base stations based on data obtained from a real cellular network .",
    "a general expression for this model is given . in section  [ sec : space ] , the spatial traffic distribution of real - world base stations is discussed and the parameters of the distribution model in three typical regions are presented . in section  [ sec : st ] , a spatial - temporal traffic modeling approach is proposed for describing the traffic pattern of single base station more practically .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn and future works are discussed in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the main characteristic of traffic in cellular networks is the high and low tide effect caused by the typical day - night behavior of users . during daily hours",
    ", users commute from residential areas to office buildings with their mobile terminals , while moving towards the opposite direction at night . this pattern of user behavior results in high daytime traffic volume and low nighttime traffic volume in office districts , and the opposite regularity in residential areas .    in order to discover the regularity of traffic variation in mobile cellular networks , the real traffic data from a mobile operator in one big city of china is analyzed .",
    "the data contains information of 185 base stations from one base station controller ( bsc ) during three weeks ranging from 2012/9/3 to 2012/9/23 in a @xmath0 area as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "the recording period of the collected data is 5 minutes . at one time",
    ", the number of recorded sectors ranges from 79 to 184 .",
    "the recorded information is the total traffic volume of each base station .",
    "the unit of traffic volume is byte .",
    "the research area is located in dense urban area and contains three typical regions : park , university campus and cbd .",
    "the real data sheet of current cellular network is shown in table  [ data ] .",
    ".real data sheet in current network [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in system analysis , it is necessary to build a traffic model for single base station . fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] shows the traffic variations of two real - world base stations in one week . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the traffic variation of one single base station is quite random and has no obvious regularity .",
    "the traditional models such as sinusoid traffic model can not reflect the randomness of single base station s traffic . in this section",
    ", we will present a spatial - temporal traffic modeling approach to model the traffic pattern of single base station more accurately .      in the previous sections ,",
    "the temporal and spatial traffic models of multiple base stations are presented .",
    "based on these models , a new spatial - temporal traffic modeling approach is proposed .",
    "it considers both the periodicity and randomness of single base station s traffic pattern .    as for a typical region contains @xmath1 base stations , the proposed modeling method comprises three steps :    step 1 : calculate the average traffic volume of all base stations in the region using the sinusoid superposition model proposed in section  [ sec : time ] .",
    "the process can be expressed as : @xmath2    step 2 : according to the empirical value of @xmath3 given in section  [ sec : space ] , compute the parameter @xmath4 of lognormal distribution at each time with the following expression : @xmath5 - \\frac{1}{2}{\\sigma ^2}\\ ] ]    this expression is obtained based on the relationship between the mean and variance of a lognormal random variable and the mean and standard deviation of the associated normal distribution expressed as : @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mean and variance of a lognormal random variable respectively , @xmath4 and @xmath3 are the mean and standard deviation of the associated normal distribution respectively .",
    "step 3 : generate the traffic value of every base station in the region at each time using lognormal distribution with parameters @xmath10 and @xmath3 expressed as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the traffic volume of the @xmath13th base station at time @xmath14 . using this method ,",
    "the traffic pattern of single base station in a typical region can be obtained and this model can be used for system analysis .      to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed spatial - temporal ( s - t ) traffic model , the real traffic data in park region and the traffic data generated by the model",
    "is compared as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_10 ] .",
    "[ fig_10 ] ( left ) illustrates the mean traffic variation of real - world base stations in park region and of data obtained by the proposed s - t model in time domain .",
    "the results show that the mean square error between the proposed s - t model and real data is 5.5% , which verified the accuracy of the model .",
    "[ fig_10 ] ( right ) demonstrates the main frequency components of real traffic data and the proposed s - t model are exactly the same .",
    "they both have periods of 24 hours and 12 hours .",
    "therefore , the proposed s - t modeling approach can accurately match the traffic pattern in real cellular networks both in time domain and frequency domain .",
    "the inhomogeneity of users and traffic is one of the important characteristics of heterogeneous cellular networks .",
    "the study of models which can accurately describe traffic patterns is necessary for designing and analyzing future ultra - dense networks .",
    "firstly , a sinusoid superposition model is proposed to model the temporal traffic pattern of multiple base stations in a region . secondly , the spatial distributions of traffic in several scenarios are analyzed including whether removing hotspots and in typical regions such as park , campus and cbd .",
    "it shows that lognormal distribution can be used to model spatial traffic distribution generally and the parameter @xmath15 of the spatial traffic model is related to the type of typical regions .",
    "the empirical values of @xmath15 in three typical regions are given .",
    "thirdly , a spatial - temporal traffic modeling approach for single base station is proposed .",
    "this model reflects both the randomness and periodicity of single base station s traffic variability .",
    "all the three models are evaluated and verified by comparing with the traffic data of s real cellular network in a big city of china .    in future",
    ", we will further study the universality of the proposed models and analyze the data of more typical regions in real cellular network .",
    "additionally , the application of these models to estimate the energy consumption in future new network architectures will be investigated .",
    "the research of new energy saving algorithms is also possible based upon these traffic models .",
