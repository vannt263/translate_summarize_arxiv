    "quantum theory prescribes probabilities for outcomes of measurements performed on microscopic systems",
    ". coherent evolution of a system is governed by the schrodinger equation , allowing determination of the time - dependent amplitudes and phases of the states characterizing the system ; the amplitudes of the measurement - basis states at the time of measurement determine the probabilities for the corresponding outcomes . while this formulation has been remarkably successful , there are issues associated with quantum measurement that have existed from the development of the theory  @xcite@xcite .    first , the fact that the theory is probabilistic and is unable to determine the outcome of a measurement on an individual system has been troubling to some , leading to suggestions that the quantum description of a system is incomplete and that there could be `` hidden variables '' that might determine measurement outcome .",
    "second , there is no known underlying origin for the born rule determining measurement probabilities ; it is a postulate of the theory .",
    "this is unlike statistical mechanics , in which probabilities can be explained in terms of deterministic classical behavior .",
    "finally , the unitary evolution governed by the schrodinger equation can not result in the observed outcome of a measurement ; at what level of microscopic description the non - unitary measurement process enters is ill - defined .",
    "this is commonly known as the ( quantum ) measurement problem .    despite claims that the success of quantum mechanics implies that these foundational problems are of little consequence ,",
    "many have emphasized the importance of resolving these issues , either by re - interpretation or modification of the theory .",
    "modifications required to address these issues could have significant implications on efforts to unify gravity and quantum mechanics  @xcite@xcite .",
    "some interpretations of quantum mechanics , such as the many - worlds and consistent - histories formulations , try to address the quantum measurement problem and the origin of the born rule  @xcite@xcite .",
    "but different interpretations of quantum mechanics make identical predictions , so these alternate theories must be considered untestable . on the other hand ,",
    "models attempting to resolve the measurement problem have been proposed that introduce new features and make predictions that differ from conventional quantum mechanics , making the proposed theories subject to verification .",
    "an example is the model of continuous spontaneous localization , which attempts to treat wave function collapse with a stochastic noise term added to the schrodinger equation and which makes predictions that should be put to the test by experiments attempting to demonstrate coherence on systems of increasing size and complexity  @xcite@xcite . in these efforts to address the measurement problem , the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics",
    "is considered a postulate .    similarly , for attempts to address nondeterminism in quantum mechanics , interpretations or even putative modifications which make no predictions different from conventional theory",
    "are untestable .",
    "the debroglie - bohm pilot - wave theory is subject to this criticism  @xcite .",
    "bell s theorem and related work enable tests of general classes of hidden - variable theories . these tests contrast predictions of quantum mechanics with those of theories including local hidden variables , at least as applied to measurements on individual members of correlated systems .",
    "all experiments so far indicate that any hidden - variables must be nonlocal . while tests of general properties of hidden - variables theories have been fruitful , we are unaware of any experimental tests for a specific , proposed hidden variable .",
    "the only prediction of measurement outcomes possible in quantum mechanics is the likelihood for a certain outcome given by the square of the coefficient of the measurement - basis state .",
    "the relationship between measurement outcome and probability amplitudes dictated by the born rule has been validated implicitly due to its ubiquity in quantum theory , but searches for dependence of measurement outcome on other parameters have been lacking .",
    "for a two - state system , normalization constrains the measurement probabilities and only one independent parameter is involved in predicting measurement outcome , the population difference between the basis states .",
    "the relative phase is the only other independent parameter characterizing a two - state system , and born s rule for deriving measurement probabilities eliminates the phase from the formulation by construction . here",
    "we consider the possibility of the relative phase of a two - state system playing a role in determining measurement outcome and therefore acting as a hidden variable .",
    "the possibility of the relative phase as a hidden variable has not been ruled out explicitly  no direct tests have been carried out , nor implicitly  it is naturally averaged over in the measurement process , eliminating the signature of any possible role in measurement outcome . yet , specifically engineering the measurement process so that it occurs at a specific value of the relative phase enables a search for a role as a hidden variable  @xcite .",
    "the traditional framework for considering hidden variables is based on the work of john bell , who showed that quantum mechanics predicts measurements made on entangled particles can exhibit correlations that can not be explained with local hidden variables  @xcite .",
    "bell - type tests are typically applied to two particles entangled in a state such as @xmath0 this could represent , for example , two spin-1/2 systems in a singlet state for @xmath1 .",
    "measurements on a particle are made in one of several bases , and the measurements applied to each system are space - like separated , so that the basis for the measurement made on system 1 can not be communicated to the measurer of system 2 .",
    "the quantum correlations associated with the measurement outcomes therefore can not be attributed to local hidden variables .",
    "all bell - type tests to date are consistent with the results of traditional quantum mechanics and imply that any hidden variables that could exist must be nonlocal .    the relative phase of a two - state system is not ruled out as a possible hidden variable by bell s theorem because it is fundamentally not a local variable ; if the system is in a superposition of widely separated states , the relative phase has to be considered nonlocal .",
    "additionally , the framework for bell s theorem does not directly apply .",
    "the relative phase is a property of a superposition state , and entanglement is not necessarily involved . for a state like that in eq .",
    "[ e.singlet ] , testing the possibility of phase as a hidden variable requires looking for a dependence of measurement outcome versus the value of @xmath2 at the moment of measurement .",
    "however , because the measurement process significantly affects the relative phase , the value at the moment of measurement may be very different than the value in the original state .",
    "searching for a dependence of measurement outcome on the value of the relative phase at which measurement occurs is difficult .",
    "the value of the phase is affected by the measurement process , to the extent that the relative phase at the moment of measurement naturally averages out over an ensemble . a special technique for forcing measurement to occur at a specific , reproducible phase is required .",
    "these points are discussed in detail in section  [ s.phase-specific ] , where we introduce a general , quantitative model of measurement on a two - state system ; we emphasize the abruptness of decoherence compared to the phase evolution of the system , demonstrating that measurement at a specific value of phase is meaningful ; we evaluate the phase evolution of the system introduced during the measurement process , showing via an uncertainty relation that the value of the relative phase at the moment of measurement naturally averages out over an ensemble ; and we present measurement strategies that circumvent this uncertainty relation and impose measurement at a specific phase .      according to standard quantum mechanics",
    ", the relative phase of a superposition state has no effect on measurement outcome ; the born rule for deducing measurement probabilities eliminates the relative phase by construction through the squaring of the complex probability amplitudes .",
    "rather , the phase serves as a record of coherent evolution , and it plays an important role in atomic clocks and other atomic interferometers . in clocks that rely on spectroscopy in which the atomic transition is probed coherently , the clock is designed as an interferometer  @xcite . the first interaction , or beam splitter , creates a population difference in the atomic sample and initiates a period of coherent phase evolution . the value of the relative phase after this evolution gets `` locked in '' by generating a phase - dependent population difference at the second beam splitter .",
    "this population difference gives the information on the atomic frequency required for clock operation .",
    "the actual measurement of the population in the two clock states after the second beam splitter destroys the coherence in the system . for any method of state readout employed in atomic clocks ,",
    "the measurement process naturally perturbs the relative phase to the extent that the measurement can not be considered to occur at a specific value of the phase .",
    "( in fact , for atomic clocks , the phase precession is typically fast enough that the duration of the measurement process is long compared to a cycle of phase evolution . )",
    "it is for this type of measurement that we are interested in considering if there is a dependence on the relative phase .",
    "if measurement outcome for a two - state system were to depend on the relative phase , the implication would be that the born rule would be an approximation that is only correct when measurements are averaged over the relative phase .",
    "classical and semi - classical examples where measurement outcome is phase - dependent , though in a way that is subtle or difficult to implement , are perhaps suggestive .",
    "the strength of the electric field of a classical optical signal varies with a phase that evolves at a rate that can be on order of @xmath3  hz . directly measuring the phase - sensitive field strength is impractical with optoelectronic devices , yet",
    "the phase manifests itself much more straightforwardly through interference effects . in the semiclassical vector model for adding two quantum angular momenta , component momenta @xmath4",
    "are portrayed as precessing about the resultant @xmath5  @xcite . for cases where there are final states with @xmath6 , the projections of the @xmath4 along the quantization axis are always opposite in sign and precess at a rate proportional to the interaction strength ( faster for the case representing the triplet state , @xmath7 , associated with larger @xmath5 , than for the singlet state @xmath8 , associated with smaller @xmath5 ) .",
    "measuring the projections of the @xmath4 implies interrupting this precession , leaving the system in a configuration representing @xmath9 or @xmath10 , depending on the phase when measured .",
    "a general , two - state quantum system can be characterized with just two independent parameters , the population difference and the relative phase between the two states .",
    "the state vector @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 where the amplitude @xmath13 and relative phase @xmath2 are real , and @xmath14 between the higher energy state @xmath15 and ground state @xmath16 , a superposition state evolves with a relative phase @xmath17 and a period @xmath18 .",
    "the measurement postulate of quantum mechanics states that measuring the system in the @xmath19basis will result in state @xmath16 with a probability of @xmath20 ( and state @xmath15 with probability @xmath21 ) .",
    "these measurement probabilities derive from the born rule , @xmath22 , an expression which dismisses the phase factor @xmath23 between the basis states that represent potential measurement outcomes .      in order to carry out a measurement ,",
    "the system must be coupled to a macroscopic reservoir that introduces irreversible evolution by damping the energy of state @xmath15 at a rate @xmath24 .",
    "a quantum fluctuation can introduce correlations between the system and reservoir , which decay in a time @xmath25  @xcite . in terms of measurement on the two - state system ,",
    "the vanishing correlations mark the point of irreversibility .",
    "the correlation time is roughly the inverse bandwidth of the reservoir and is very short for a macroscopic reservoir . in most cases",
    ", @xmath25 is much shorter than any time for the quantum system to evolve , so that the measurement process takes place over a very short interval of time and a very small range of relative phases @xmath26 , which we can take to be zero .",
    "this amounts to the markov approximation for the reservoir .",
    "a quantum fluctuation corresponds to measurement on the coherent two - state system via the presence or absence of spontaneous emission from the @xmath15 to @xmath16 transition  @xcite .",
    "the average time needed to acquire information from the system for a measurement is the lifetime of state @xmath15 , @xmath27 , which we call the measurement time @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "once the system and reservoir are coupled ( some amplitude in @xmath15 ) , the probability of a quantum fluctuation resulting in measurement at time @xmath29 is @xmath30 ; beyond this , the specific time for a fluctuation to occur is unpredictable ( fig .",
    "[ f.reservoir](a ) ) . a measurement can be applied at a specific @xmath2 , then , in a system in which @xmath28 is short compared to the period @xmath31 .      for systems where the phase evolution is very fast , such as in an atomic clock , this requirement on the measurement time is stringent .",
    "in fact , this condition is _ never _ satisfied , no matter how slow the phase evolution of the system , when the method used to differentiate the two states relies on resolving their frequency difference .",
    "the fourier - transform limit for resolving a frequency difference @xmath32 requires measuring for an interval of time @xmath33 . since the energy difference between the states is @xmath34 , during this time the relative phase of a superposition state evolves by an amount @xmath35 so the measurement time required to resolve two states spectroscopically is always on order of @xmath31 , and measurement can occur at any value of @xmath2 between 0 and 2@xmath36 radians .",
    "( the only phase specificity in this case is due to the exponential probability distribution for a measurement to occur . )",
    "we know of no measurements on two - state systems , including atomic clocks or specific qubits in quantum information , in which the phase of the state at the moment of measurement is not averaged out over an ensemble .    to get around this , a spectroscopic measurement can be applied in which the coupling to the reservoir is on only during a specific , narrow range of values of @xmath2 , as illustrated in fig .",
