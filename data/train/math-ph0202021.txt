    "scattering from a slowly changing scatterer is described , to leading order , by a _",
    "time independent _ scatterer frozen at the scattering time @xcite .",
    "although this seems like stating the obvious , it turns out that in trying to make precise how accurate this approximation is , one encounters both conceptual and technical difficulties .",
    "our aim is to describe these difficulties and explain how they are resolved .",
    "one conceptual difficulty is to understand what the frozen s matrix  a function of energy and scattering time ",
    "means . strictly speaking",
    ", a function of both time and energy is in conflict with the uncertainty principle .",
    "a wave that is sharp in energy will have an ill - defined scattering time and conversely , a wave with a well - defined scattering time is ill - defined in energy .",
    "what , then , is the meaning of the frozen s matrix ?",
    "the resolution of this problem is related to the fact that the adiabatic limit naturally leads to different parameterizations of time , and the right parameterization has small uncertainty .",
    "specifically , the physical time @xmath1 will parameterize the intrinsic `` fast '' dynamics and has the usual time - energy uncertainty @xmath2 . the slow variation in the external conditions will be parameterized by @xmath3 .",
    "we refer to the latter as _",
    "epoch_. since the epoch often plays a role of a parameter it is convenient to choose @xmath3 dimensionless .",
    "the two parameterizations are related by @xmath4 , with @xmath5 a slow frequency  the adiabaticity parameter .",
    "the epoch - energy uncertainty then takes the form @xmath6 and so arbitrarily small in the adiabatic limit .",
    "coherent states provide a convenient basis to analyze the semi - classical limit @xcite .",
    "semi - classical analysis is traditionally about the @xmath7 limit , but is equally valid when @xmath2 is fixed ( and henceforth set equal to one ) and @xmath8 . here",
    "we introduce coherent states labelled by points in the time - energy plane , with time being the scattering time .",
    "as we shall see , the frozen s matrix approximates the diagonal matrix elements of the dynamical scattering matrix in such coherent states .",
    "this reconciles the time - energy uncertainty with the frozen scattering data . in a further step ,",
    "matrix elements of the frozen s matrix can be approximated by the on - shell data .",
    "another thorny issue that we address is when a description in terms of frozen data is meaningful and how accurate it is .",
    "the question can also be rephrased as a question about the intrinsic time scale relevant to scattering .",
    "if @xmath9 denotes this time scale , then @xmath10 is the error in the frozen data and @xmath11 characterizes the adiabatic regime .",
    "the wigner time delay @xmath12 conveys information about the time the particle spends near the scatterer .",
    "it is a function of the energy @xmath13 and scattering epoch @xmath3 .",
    "it is tempting to hope that @xmath9 might be estimated by @xmath12 , but there is no compelling argument for doing so .",
    "one can not argue on the basis of dimensional analysis alone , since @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with dot a derivative with respect to the epoch and prime with respect to the energy , give additional and independent time scales .",
    "in fact , since wigner time delay is a _ comparison _ of the arrival time at a faraway point , relative to the time of arrival in the free dynamics , it is not even positive - definite .",
    "this suggests that it can not quite capture @xmath9 , which is more closely related to the `` dwell time '' near the scatterer .",
    "the way to determine @xmath9 is to consider the error in approximating the scattering data by the frozen data .",
    "the error is , to leading order , proportional to the adiabaticity parameter @xmath5 .",
    "since the error is , in general , complex , we identify @xmath9 with the absolute value of the error divided by @xmath5 . calculating the error , to leading order in @xmath5 ,",
    "is no harder , and reminiscent of , calculating the scattering in the lowest order of the born approximation .",
    "we shall see that , to leading order , the adiabatic time scale @xmath9 can be estimated from the scattering data and the derivative of the hamiltonian @xmath16 with respect to the epoch , eq .",
    "( [ tau+e ] ) below , but not from the wigner time delay alone .",
    "we show this by considering an exactly soluble model where the dynamical s matrix can be computed explicitly .",
    "we introduce the _ energy shift _",
    "operator @xmath17 .",
    "this is a measure of the energy change in time dependent scattering and is a natural dual of the wigner time delay . as we shall see , in the case that the incoming state is @xmath0 , the outgoing state is @xmath18 .",
    "in the adiabatic limit , the energy shift can be approximated by the frozen energy shift , which is related to the logarithmic derivative of the on - shell scattering matrix with respect to the epoch , eq .",
    "( [ on - shell - shift ] ) .",
    "the energy shift then gives a handle on the exchange of energy @xcite and the pumping of charge in adiabatic scattering @xcite .",
    "scattering theory is a comparison of dynamics : one is the actual dynamics generated by the time dependent @xmath19 , the other is a fiducial dynamics generated by a _",
    "time independent _ hamiltonian @xmath20 . the hamiltonian @xmath20 is the generator of dynamics for which there is trivial scattering and the s matrix is the identity .",
    "the results of this section are true in general , without taking the adiabatic limit @xmath21 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath16 and @xmath20 admit good scattering .",
    "namely , we assume the existence of wave operators and the unitarity of the s matrix . for explicit conditions on @xmath20 and @xmath22 that guarantee this see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the evolution from time @xmath25 to @xmath26 , generated by @xmath22 and the time - independent @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the wave operators , based at epoch @xmath3 , are defined by the ( strong ) limit @xmath27    the existence of the limit , and the equation of motion imply    the dependence of the wave operator on the base point @xmath3 satisfy the differential equation @xmath28    as we shall presently see , the notion of wave operator based at epoch @xmath3 is only interesting in the case of a time dependent @xmath22 .",
    "the frozen hamiltonian @xmath29 is _ time independent _ so @xmath30 , in this case and @xmath31 is independent of the base point @xmath32 .",
    "this follows from the existence of the limit in eq .",
    "( [ wave - operator ] ) since @xmath33 is the same as @xmath34 . to stress this we write @xmath35 . from eq .",
    "( [ omega - dot ] ) then follows the standard intertwining relation of time - independent scattering theory :    the wave operators @xmath35 relating the frozen hamiltonian at epoch @xmath3 and @xmath20 are independent of the base point , and intertwine the two dynamics : @xmath36      the ( dynamical ) scattering matrix based at epoch @xmath3 is defined by @xmath37 the s matrices based on different points in time are all related by conjugation generated by the free evolution .",
    "namely :    suppose that the wave operators exist .",
    "then @xmath38    this follows from @xmath39 . under a change of the reference hamiltonian ,",
    "say to the frozen hamiltonian @xmath29 , @xmath40      in the frozen s data the epoch is decoupled from time .",
    "as such it can also be studied using time independent methods , which are normally quite powerful @xcite .",
    "its basic properties are in marked contrast with that of the dynamical s matrix , namely :    the frozen s matrix @xmath41 is independent of the base point .",
    "it depends on the freezing time parametrically through @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath20 provides a basis that spans the hilbert space of scattering states .",
    "let @xmath42 denote the generalized eigenvectors of @xmath20 : @xmath43 @xmath13 is the energy and @xmath44 labels the scattering channels .",
    "@xmath45 commutes with @xmath20 , by eq .",
    "( [ intertwine ] ) , hence @xmath46 @xmath47 is the _ on - shell _ scattering matrix . note that in the frozen hamiltonian the physical time is decoupled from the epoch , which now has been relegated to the role of a parameter .",
    "the on - shell scattering matrix therefore is not in conflict with the uncertainty principle .",
    "by taking the @xmath3-derivatives of eq .",
    "( [ sd0:sds ] ) one gets @xmath48{\\mathcal{s}}_d^\\dagger(s ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & [ h_0,{\\mathcal{s}}_d(s)-{\\mathcal{s}}_f(h_s , h_0)]{\\mathcal{s}}_d^\\dagger(s).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation may interpreted as follows .",
    "if we think of @xmath20 as the asymptotic observable associated with the outgoing energy , then @xmath49 represents the asymptotic observable @xcite corresponding to the incoming energy .",
    "this motivates calling @xmath50 the operator of energy shift .",
    "the energy shift vanishes for time independent scattering , as it must .",
    "it gives a handle on changes in ( certain ) quantum states . by the functional calculus applied to eq .",
    "( [ dots ] ) , for any function @xmath51 : @xmath52 this is interpreted as follows : if @xmath0 is the incoming state , then the corresponding outgoing state is @xmath53 the energy shift is a first order quantity in the adiabaticity parameter and , as we shall see , it can be approximated , to leading order by the frozen data .",
    "this then gives a handle on the outgoing state @xmath51 to first order in the adiabaticity parameter .",
    "we first remark that ( [ remainder - leading],[tau+e ] ) generalize to off - diagonal matrix elements , i.e. , the time @xmath1 in the ket @xmath125 may be shifted to @xmath126 ( resp .",
    "@xmath127 in ( [ tau+e ] ) ) while leaving the bra unchanged . by the translation property of coherent states , property 5.2.c , multiplication by @xmath20",
    "can be traded for derivative with respect to time .",
    "hence @xmath128{\\left\\vert t+\\delta   t , e , j';{\\varepsilon}\\right\\rangle } } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\!\\ !",

    "the last identity in the equation above can be seen from @xmath129 we then multiply ( [ eq : comm ] ) with the complex conjugate of the mentioned generalization of ( [ remainder - leading ] ) and integrate over @xmath130 using property 5.2.e . the result",
    "then heuristically follows from eq .",
    "( [ dots ] ) and the statement for @xmath131 analogous to ( [ on - shell - coherent ] ) . can be made , more directly , starting from the rhs of eq .",
    "[ dots ] and using born s expansion . ]    the energy shift plays a role in the theory of adiabatic quantum pumps . in particular , the pumped charge , the entropy production and noise generation in quantum pumps can all be expressed in terms of the energy shift @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that basic properties of adiabatic quantum pumps can be understood , to leading order , in terms of the frozen scattering data alone .",

    "in contrast , the frozen s matrix is independent of the choice of a base point and depends non - trivially on the freezing time  the frozen scattering data for one epoch know nothing a - priori about the corresponding data at any other epoch .",
    "matrix elements of the scattering matrix carry information about the time that the wave is near the scatterer . for such matrix elements ,",
    "the adiabatic limit can be expressed in terms of the corresponding frozen matrix elements . however , the introduction of wave packets promotes the epoch from playing the role of a parameter , to that of real , albeit slow , time .",
    "one then needs to confront the uncertainty principle .",
    "we do that by considering matrix elements between coherent states labelled by points in the energy time plane .",
    "the wigner time delay is defined in terms of the on - shell scattering matrix .",

    "one of the problems of adiabatic scattering is to study the relation between these time scales and the time scale @xmath9 such that @xmath59 characterizes the adiabatic regime .",
    "for a particle moving on the line , its energy and the time that it crosses the origin are canonical coordinates .",
    "one can therefore construct energy - time coherent states in analogy with the usual phase space coherent states .",
    "the explicit construction , however , depends on the dispersion law . for linear dispersion",
    "the construction is particularly simple .",

    "a simpler situation is obtained in the case of linear dispersion , @xmath66 .",
    "there is now no ambiguity in the direction of crossing and the energy - time phase space is again the plane .",

    "linear dispersion approximates the low energy physics of electrons in one dimensional channels provided the fermi energy is large .",
    "the price one pays is that the `` ultraviolet '' properties are pathological .",
    "in particular , the spectrum is unbounded below and this then leads to certain anomalies which must be correctly interpreted . with linear dispersion",
    "one can also solve certain models with interacting electrons @xcite .    in the following we shall study adiabatic scattering for _ non interacting _ particles with linear dispersion .",
    "the particles move on a collection of lines and are allowed to `` hop '' from one line to the other and scatter .",
