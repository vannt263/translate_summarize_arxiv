    "in the last decades multivariate statistical process control ( spc ) has received considerable attention , since in practice many processes are observed in a vector form ( montgomery@xmath0 ) .",
    "univariate control charts have been extensively discussed in the literature ( montgomery@xmath0 , box and luce~ nno@xmath1 , del castilo@xmath2 ) and many efforts have been devoted to upgrading the control charts for : ( a ) cases of correlated univariate processes ; and ( b ) cases of multivariate uncorrelated processes .",
    "multivariate control charting has been discussed in many studies , e.g. tracy _ et al._@xmath3 , liu@xmath4 , kourti and macgregor@xmath5 , mason _",

    "most of the current research has been focused on the hotelling s @xmath15 control chart and the multivariate ewma control chart for controlling the process mean .",
    "et al._@xmath16 , surtihadi _ et al._@xmath17 , cheng and thaga@xmath18 and costa and rahim@xmath19 propose and study multivariate ewma and cusum control charts to control the dispersion of a multivariate process .",
    "as stated before univariate control charts for autocorrelated processes have been discussed in the literature ( montgomery@xmath0 , box and luce~ nno@xmath1 ) , however , for multivariate processes the general focus has been placed to uncorrelated processes .",
    "et al._@xmath20 , jiang@xmath21 , kalgonda and kulkarni@xmath22 and noorossana and vaghefi@xmath23 consider multivariate control charting for autocorrelated processes based on autoregressive - moving - average ( arma ) time series models and the @xmath15 and multivariate cusum control charts are illustrated .",
    "pan and jarrett@xmath24 build a multivariate @xmath15 control chart for the forecast errors of the process .",
    "they consider a state - space approach for modelling the underlying process and they point out that the problem of monitoring multivariate processes is a problem of multivariate time series forecasting as well as a problem of control charting .",
    "some forms of bayesian control charts , known also as adaptive or dynamic control charts , are discussed in tagaras@xmath25 , tagaras and nikolaidis@xmath26 , de magalh~ aes _ et al._@xmath27 and in references therein .",
    "adaptive control charts offer the flexibility and versatility to dynamically change the sampling size and the sampling interval of a shewhart control chart , but they are disadvantaged in that the complexity is increased and usually the modeller has to resort to monte carlo simulation .",
    "our aim in this paper is to construct a multivariate control chart for autocorrelated processes in such a way that the scheme will be capable to monitor the process mean vector only , the process dispersion covariance matrix only , or both the process mean vector and the process dispersion covariance matrix .",
    "we propose a new control chart based on the theory of sequential bayes factors ( west and harrison@xmath28 ) .",
    "first we fit a local level model to the multivariate process and then we apply a univariate modified ewma control chart to the logarithm of the bayes factor to monitor the dispersion of the predictive distribution of the data from the target distribution .",
    "our model makes use of a generalization of the shewhart - deming model for multivariate autocorrelated processes ( deming@xmath29 , del castilo@xmath2 , triantafyllopoulos _ et al._@xmath30 ) .",
    "section [ s2 ] gives the necessary time series background .",
    "the proposed control chart is discussed in detail in section [ s2s2 ] . in sections",
    "[ s5s2 ] and [ s5s1 ] two examples , consisting of data from the london metal exchange and from a production of a plastic mould , illustrate the methodology and give light to the design and implementation of the new control chart .",
    "concluding comments are given in section [ s6 ] and the appendix details a proof of an argument in section [ s2s2 ] .",
    "the conventional control charts are based on the shewhart - deming model , e.g. for a @xmath31 process vector @xmath32 this model sets @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the process mean vector and @xmath35 is the process dispersion covariance matrix , known also as the measurement covariance matrix . here @xmath36 indicates the @xmath37-dimensional normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix @xmath35 .",
    "the measurement drift sequence @xmath38 is assumed uncorrelated and this makes the generating process @xmath39 an uncorrelated sequence too . in this paper",
    "we extend the above model by considering equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , but now @xmath34 is replaced by a time - dependent @xmath40 , which follows a multivariate random walk model , known also as local level model ( durbin and koopman@xmath41 ) .",
    "discount weighted regression ( dwr ) , which originated in the path - breaking work of brown@xmath42 , is a method for forecasting autocorrelated time series . considering univariate time series ameen and harrison@xmath43 developed further dwr for more complex time series . the reviews of ameen@xmath44 and goodwin@xmath45 suggest that dwr can model efficiently time series in a wide range of situations .",
    "triantafyllopoulos and pikoulas@xmath46 developed a multivariate version of dwr and these authors focused on the estimation of the measurement covariance matrix . in this paper",
    "we consider the dwr method of triantafyllopoulos@xmath47 for multivariate local level models defined by @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the scalar @xmath51 is specified with the aid of a discount factor @xmath52 and the sequences @xmath38 and @xmath53 are mutually and individually uncorrelated , e.g. @xmath54 , for all @xmath55 , @xmath56 and for all @xmath57 .",
    "here @xmath58 denotes expectation and @xmath59 denotes the row vector of @xmath60 .",
    "the model definition is complete by specifying a prior distribution @xmath61 , which is usually the @xmath37-dimensional normal distribution , e.g. @xmath62 , for some known prior mean vector @xmath63 and a positive scalar @xmath64 .",
    "it is further assumed that @xmath65 is uncorrelated of all @xmath66 .",
    "for some positive integer @xmath67 , let @xmath68 be the information set comprising data up to and including time @xmath69 , for @xmath70 .",
    "with the prior @xmath71 , the posterior density of @xmath72 is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are updated by @xmath76 with @xmath77 being the one - step forecast error vector at time @xmath78 .",
    "define the residual error vector @xmath79 . for each time",
    "@xmath69 the estimator @xmath80 of @xmath35 is achieved by least squares estimation as @xmath81 after observing that @xmath82 details of the derivations of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath80 appear in triantafyllopoulos and pikoulas@xmath46 and triantafyllopoulos@xmath47 .    from the above",
    "it follows that the one - step forecast density is @xmath83 and the corresponding one - step forecast error density is @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the adequacy of the model is evaluated via the mean of squared standard one - step forecast error vector ( msse ) , the mean of absolute percentage one - step forecast error vector ( mape ) and the mean of absolute one - step forecast error vector ( mae ) .",
    "these statistics are discussed in chatfield@xmath86 and for data @xmath87 they are defined by @xmath88',\\quad e_t^*=\\left\\{\\frac{(\\delta+p_{t-1})s_{t-1}}{\\delta}\\right\\}^{-1/2}e_t,\\\\ mape=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t=1}^n\\left[\\frac{|e_{1t}|}{y_{1t}}~ \\frac{|e_{2t}|}{y_{2t}}~ \\cdots ~\\frac{|e_{pt}|}{y_{pt } } \\right]',\\quad mae=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t=1}^n\\left[|e_{1t}|~|e_{2t}|~ \\cdots ~ |e_{pt}|\\right]',\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the standard one - step forecast error , @xmath90'$ ] , @xmath91'$ ] and @xmath92 denotes the inverse of the symmetric square root of the matrix @xmath93 based on the spectral decomposition of symmetric matrices ( gupta and nagar@xmath94 ; pages 6 - 7 )",
    ". if the model fit is good the msse should be close to the vector @xmath95'$ ] , while mape and mae should be as small as possible in absolute value .",
    "note that the mape , as a percentage statistic , makes sense only for a positive valued process @xmath32 , for all @xmath69 .",
    "if this is not the case , then mape can not have a meaningful interpretation and it should be excluded from the statistical analysis ( chatfield@xmath86 ) .",
    "bayes factors have been extensively discussed in the statistics literature and recently they have been applied sequentially for time series , see e.g. west and harrison@xmath28 ( chapter 11 ) .",
    "salvador and gargallo@xmath96 propose a monitoring scheme , based on bayes factors , for multivariate time series , but this approach is not suitable for control charting , because it is applied in a model selection problem .",
    "in addition to this , most of the bayesian time series monitoring ( including the work of salvador and gargallo@xmath96 ) relies upon simulated based methods and in particular monte carlo simulation . in this paper",
    "we favour non - iterative techniques , because they are faster , more flexible and easier to apply .",
    "once we have the distribution ( [ eq5 ] ) we can construct a target distribution for the dispersion of @xmath32 from the target mean and then compare these two distributions .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. pan and jarrett@xmath24 ) that the forecast errors @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 are approximately uncorrelated and the approximation is so good as @xmath80 is closer to @xmath35 .",
    "suppose now that the target mean of @xmath39 is denoted by @xmath34 and the process dispersion covariance matrix is denoted by @xmath100 .",
    "this notation is consistent with the shewhart - deming model as in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , with @xmath101 so that @xmath102 and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 denotes the covariance matrix of @xmath32",
    ". is is assumed that @xmath34 is a generally unknown vector , but not stochastic . in our model of equation ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "we have @xmath105 and @xmath106 , but now @xmath40 is stochastic and it also changes with time according to the random walk model of ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "we postulate that , if the process is in control , the one step forecast mean of @xmath32 will be close to the target mean vector @xmath34 and the forecast covariance matrix of @xmath32 will be close to the target dispersion covariance matrix @xmath100 .",
    "thus we can define the target error distribution by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the process error , also known in the process adjustment literature ( del castillo@xmath2 ) as disturbance drift .",
    "here we assume that @xmath100 is positive definite matrix , although the proposed approach can be modified when @xmath100 is positive semi - definite .",
    "according to the above postulate , if model ( [ eq1 ] ) describes well the in - control process , density ( [ eq5 ] ) should be close to the above target distribution . in order to find out ",
    "how close \" it is , we form the bayes factor at time @xmath69 : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 denote the probability density functions of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .    for consistency in the above equation",
    "we need to make the convention @xmath114 ( the null or empty set ) .",
    "since both densities @xmath115 and @xmath116 are normal we have @xmath117 where @xmath118 denotes the determinant of a square matrix .",
    "the bayes factor @xmath119 takes values from @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "we will say that the process @xmath122 is in control at time @xmath69 , if @xmath123 , or if @xmath124 ; otherwise the process will be out of control , at this time point .",
    "an out of control signal might be caused because of a mean shift ( e.g. when @xmath125 is significantly different than @xmath34 ) or because of a dispersion shift ( e.g. @xmath126 is significantly different than @xmath100 ) .      a control chart for the bayes factor @xmath119 can conclude whether @xmath119 is close to 1 and thus whether the process is in control or not . since @xmath119 is positive valued , it is more convenient to work with the logarithm of the bayes factor @xmath127 and so we can construct an appropriate univariate control chart for @xmath128 . in order to propose such a chart we need to deal with two issues : ( a ) the values of @xmath128 will be serially correlated and ( b ) the distribution of @xmath128 might not be normal .    considering ( a ) , in our development it is clear that , from the definition of the @xmath119 , either the original data @xmath32 are i.i.d . or auto - correlated , the resulting data @xmath119 ( or @xmath128 ) will be correlated and hence , if the shewhart or any other control chart is to be used successfully , they should be modified appropriately to accommodate for correlated observations .",
    "many authors have demonstrated that the shewhart control charts need to be modified in order to cater for serially correlated observations ( vasilopoulos and stamboulis@xmath129 ; schmid@xmath130 ) .",
    "similarly , the ewma needs also to be modified and the resulting modified ewma control chart has been discussed in many articles including schmid@xmath131 and vanbrackle and reynolds@xmath132 . according to harris and ross@xmath131 ignoring serial correlation has a stronger effect in ewma than in the shewhart control chart , but as we will see later the ewma control chart is preferable to shewhart , because it is more robust to the assumption of normality .",
    "one could also consider the modified cusum chart for correlated observations , but we will not further discuss this in the present paper .    proceeding with",
    "( b ) one needs to check the assumption of normality , before applying a modified ewma ( or shewhart or cusum ) control chart .",
    "et al._@xmath133 studied the arl performance of the ewma and they suggested that the ewma with a smoothing parameter equal to 0.05 is very effective , even in the presence of non - normality of the observations .",
    "this result agrees with montogomery@xmath0 who states for the ewma `` it is almost a perfectly non - parametric ( distribution free ) procedure '' .",
    "et al._@xmath134 study the robustness to normality of the ewma by tabulating characteristics of the run length distributions ( e.g. arl ) for observations generated by several gamma distributions .",
    "these results conclude that , for relatively low values of the damping parameter of the ewma and for shifts in the mean the ewma control chart can be used , even in the absence of normality . moreover ,",
    "if the process is in - control following a symmetrical , but not normal , distribution , then the ewma can be applied successfully . to the following we look at the empirical distribution of @xmath128 when the process is in control and when it is out of control .",
    "we generate 1000 vectors from a bivariate normal distribution @xmath135 with @xmath136 \\quad \\textrm{and } \\quad v=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 5\\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] and we generate 1000 vectors for three out of control scenarios . in scenario 1",
    "we simulate data from @xmath137 ( deviations from the mean @xmath34 ) ; in scenario 2 we simulate data from @xmath138 ( deviations from the covariance matrix @xmath100 ) ; in scenario 3 we simulate data from @xmath139 ( deviations from both @xmath34 and @xmath100 ) , where @xmath140 \\quad \\textrm{and } \\quad v_d=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } 1 & 2.5 \\\\ 2.5 & 8\\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] figure [ hist1 ] shows the histograms of the @xmath128 for the above four scenarios ( one in control and three out of control scenarios ) . from this figure we observe that , although the distribution of the @xmath128 for the in - control process ( panel ( a ) in figure [ hist1 ] ) is not - normal , it is roughly symmetric .",
    "the distributions of the @xmath128 for the out of control processes appear to be slightly skewed , but the histograms are not conclusive .",
    "the important point is the non - normality of the @xmath128 and the symmetry of the distribution of the in - control process .",
    "this enables us to make use of the modified ewma control chart , but we note that the modified cusum control chart can also be used . a more formal confirmation of the non - normality of the distribution of @xmath128 can be carried out by the using standard tests of normality , however , here the histograms are deemed sufficient to declare the non - normality of the distribution of @xmath128 .",
    "we use a two phase control scheme ; in phase i the mean @xmath34 and the covariance matrix @xmath35 are estimated and adjustments are applied if necessary , while in phase ii the ewma control chart is applied to detect any changes in the mean of @xmath128 .",
    "thus we propose the algorithm :    [ alg3 ] there are two phases :    phase i : : :    we fit the dwr model ( [ eq2 ] ) for a set of historical data    @xmath141 , with @xmath142 .",
    "we check the    performance and adequacy of the model via the msse , mape and mae over    all @xmath141 and we possible apply adjustments    to the dwr model , ( e.g. adjustments in the mean level ) so that we    obtain optimal values @xmath143 ,    @xmath144 , @xmath145    ensuring that in phase i the model matches the in - control process .",
    "the    modified ewma control chart is applied so that control limits are    adequately defined according to pre - specified arl curves .",
    "for this to    be designed , a state - space model for the process @xmath128    needs to be identified and here simple ar and arma modelling will be    generally acceptable .",
    "phase ii : : :    we fit the dwr model with the model components from phase i ( e.g.    @xmath145 , @xmath146 ,    @xmath147 and we apply a modified ewma control    chart at observations @xmath128 with the control limits    identified at phase i , for @xmath148 .    in order to apply the modified ewma control chart",
    "we first calculate the series @xmath149 with observations @xmath150 as @xmath151 the parameter @xmath152 is the ewma smoothing parameter and as it is mentioned above , for @xmath153 or @xmath154 the control chart is robust to normality .",
    "then , the control limits of the modified ewma control chart are @xmath155 where @xmath156 , @xmath157 ( asymptotic variance of @xmath149 ) and @xmath158 is determined according to the required arl . for ar(1 )",
    "dependence @xmath159 and for large @xmath69 , the asymptotic variance @xmath160 is @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 , @xmath164 are assumed known . in practice",
    "these parameters are estimated at phase i. according to schmid@xmath131 the asymptotic variance @xmath160 performs better than the exact variance of @xmath149 , which is given in schmid@xmath131 and which produces time - dependent control limits .",
    "most of the literature on this topic focuses on deriving the variance @xmath160 assuming simple time series models for @xmath165 , e.g. as in the above ar(1 ) or as in the arma(1,1 ) model considered in vanbrackle and reynolds@xmath132 .",
    "algorithm [ alg3 ] can be simplified , if at phase i , the quantities @xmath75 and @xmath80 converge to stable values and these values are determined in phase i for both phases .",
    "this brings up a well known problem , which has received considerable attention in the time series literature ( see e.g. durbin and koopman@xmath41 ) .",
    "however , for the dwr and similar multivariate models limiting results for @xmath75 and @xmath80 have not been yet established .",
    "the next theorem ( which proof is in the appendix ) states that @xmath75 and @xmath80 converge to stable limiting values .",
    "[ th2 ] in the dwr model ( [ eq2 ] ) the estimator @xmath80 of the measurement covariance matrix @xmath35 converges in probability to @xmath35 and the non - stochastic scalar parameter @xmath75 converges to the limit @xmath166 , i.e. @xmath167 and @xmath168 .    from theorem [ th2 ]",
    "the estimator @xmath80 is consistent and from the proof of this theorem ( given in the appendix ) , @xmath80 is also unbiased estimator .",
    "theorem [ th2 ] suggests that @xmath169 in the calculation of @xmath128 of equation ( [ eq7 ] ) can be replaced by its limit @xmath170 . from equation ( [ eq : mt ] ) and theorem [ th2 ] ,",
    "the forecast of @xmath32 , @xmath171 can be approximated by @xmath172 where @xmath169 of equation ( [ eq7 ] ) is replaced by @xmath170 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows how fast @xmath173 converges to its limit @xmath170 , for a prior @xmath174 and three values of @xmath52 .",
    "this figure points out that @xmath75 is bounded above by 1 , but for @xmath175 , this bound is only achieved after @xmath176 ( solid line in figure [ fig1 ] ) , while for @xmath177 , this bound is achieved for any @xmath178 ( dotted line in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this gives an empirical indication of the speed of convergence of @xmath173 , for several values of @xmath52 .",
    "the limit @xmath170 is known before the algorithm starts ( e.g. @xmath170 depends only on @xmath52 ) and , given enough data in phase i , the limit @xmath35 can be approximated by @xmath179 , in the end of phase i. this can have an additional benefit on computational savings , but more importantly it gives a theoretical justification that the dwr produces a good copy of the process @xmath39 and therefore this model is appropriate for the monitoring part at phase ii of algorithm [ alg3 ] .",
    "for example , if @xmath75 and @xmath80 were not converging to stable values , no matter how many data we collected at phase i , the covariance matrix of @xmath32 and thus its uncertainty would change over time resulting in an unstable time series model .",
    "false alarms are probable in the framework of such unstable models , which should be avoided .    in the design and application of the control chart it is important to suggest values of @xmath63 , @xmath180 , @xmath52 and @xmath181 and to study their sensitivity and influence to the performance of the proposed control chart .",
    "since these suggestions are related to forecasting as in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) , results on the sensitivity of such prior parameters follow from triantafyllopoulos and pikoulas@xmath46 and triantafyllopoulos@xmath47 .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that , given enough data in phase i , the values of @xmath63 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 are not critical to the forecast performance , as in time series modelling prior information is deflated over time .",
    "this is indicated in theorem [ th2 ] from the fact that @xmath170 does not depend on @xmath180 .",
    "the value of @xmath52 can be critical in forecasting and a general recommendation is that several values of @xmath52 ( in the range of @xmath182 ) are applied in phase i and according to the forecast performance ( see section [ s2 ] ) a value of @xmath52 is decided .",
    "one should note that high values of @xmath52 ( e.g. @xmath177 ) yield smooth forecasts with low forecast variances , but these forecasts are sometimes unable to forecast abrupt changes in the data ; low values of @xmath52 ( e.g. @xmath183 ) yield more precise forecasts in the presence of `` wild data '' , but these forecasts come with increased forecast variances .    our proposal for the modified ewma control chart for the @xmath128 process is motivated from the fact that the observations @xmath128 possess autocorrelation and non - normality .",
    "the approach is model - based , and so a comparison with traditionally used multivariate control charts , such as the hotelling s @xmath15 and the m - ewma ( which are both data - based control charts ) , is difficult and in many occasions it can not give justice . within the model - based control charting methods , it appears that our approach can be compared with the residual chart ( pan and jarrett@xmath24 ) , but again the comparisons need to make sure that model uncertainty ( whether for example the dwr is a good model or an alternative time series model performs better ) should be ideally removed before any comparison is attempted . for example",
    "a miss - specification of a time series model might result to a false result in the comparison of the competing control charts . from our experience",
    "the dwr works generally well ( since it is a generalization of the shewhart - deming model ) , but this might not be the case for every multivariate process .",
    "we believe that such a comparison should deserve the length and the detail of a whole paper and thus here we do not pursue this project .",
    "next we give two examples illustrating the design and application of the proposed control chart .    to the above we",
    "have assumed that given a process @xmath39 the interest is in building a control chart for monitoring simultaneously the process mean and the dispersion covariance matrix . however , in some cases the interest is placed on monitoring the dispersion covariance matrix only . in this case",
    "we can modify the control scheme by considering a modified ewma control chart of the log - bayes factors of the first order difference process @xmath184 , which from equation ( [ eq2 ] ) has zero mean .",
    "control charts based on @xmath185 will be more robust as compared to those for @xmath39 , since the uncertainty of monitoring the process mean of @xmath39 has been removed .",

    "adopting the usual forecasting strategy of commodity forecasting , given data up to time @xmath78 , the forecast mean of @xmath32 at time @xmath69 is just the value of @xmath197 and so we can write @xmath198",

    "as @xmath152 increases the modified ewma control chart is losing its robustness over normality , but for symmetric process distributions , such as the empirical distribution of the @xmath128 shown in figure [ hist1 ] , the ewma control chart might still be used for @xmath206 .",
    "the correlation of the @xmath128 is accounted by the autoregressive model of section [ s2s2 ] and an analysis involving the data at phase i shows that an the autoregressive parameter @xmath207 is adequate to capture the autocorrelation of @xmath128 . according to tables for the @xmath208 of the modified ewma control chart ( see e.g. shiau and hsu@xmath209 ) we choose the value of @xmath210 in equation ( [ cl ] ) so that @xmath211 , e.g. for @xmath153 and @xmath207 we have @xmath212 .",

    "the mean of the ewma @xmath149 is slightly lower than zero , which indicates that , for the entire process",
    "@xmath202 , there will be some deviation of the predictive density @xmath217 from the target density @xmath218 .",
    "it is up to the modeller to decide whether such deviation from the target distribution is worth of declaring the process out of control . in search of a more automatic approach",
    ", one can lift up the whole control chart so that in phase i the mean of @xmath149 is exactly zero .",
    "this can be performed automatically , in the end of phase i , and this will declare the process in control in phase ii , for @xmath219 , while for @xmath220 there is an out of control point at @xmath214 . in figure [ fig13 ]",
    "the value of @xmath206 is rather high to ensuring correct control limits of the modified ewma chart ( see the relevant discussion in page ) ; here the chart with @xmath206 is mainly shown for comparison purposes with the charts with lower values of @xmath152 , but in practice we suggest that @xmath152 does not exceed 0.2 , unless there is strong evidence to support the assumption of normality for the distribution of @xmath128 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the concentration of consecutive ewma values under the mean in phase ii is causing warning , which is apparent in all charts .",
    "the phenomenon is more apparent in the charts for @xmath153 and @xmath154 and it can suggest the out of control state of the process at @xmath214,which is apparent in the charts with @xmath213 and @xmath206 .",
    "the interpretation of the out of control signal at @xmath214 can not be done just by looking at figure [ fig12 ] and more dedicated methods of out of control variable identification need to be employed , see e.g. bersimis _ et al._@xmath13 .",
    "in an experiment of production of a plastic mould the quality is centered on the control of temperature and its variation . for this purpose five measurements of the temperature of the mould have been taken , for @xmath221 time points .",
    "the experiment is fully described in pan and jarrett@xmath24 and these authors show that this 5-dimensional production process @xmath39 is both autocorrelated and serially correlated including both vector autoregressive and moving average terms .",
    "these authors use a vector state space charting approach based on the hotelling control chart resulting on 12 out of control signals at phase ii ( time points from @xmath222 to @xmath193 ) and hence concluding that the process falls badly out of control at phase ii .",
    "we have used the data at phase i ( time points @xmath223 ) in order to estimate the target mean vector @xmath224'$ ] ( as the average of each @xmath225 : @xmath223 ) and the dispersion covariance matrix @xmath226\\ ] ] ( as the sample covariance matrix of each @xmath32 : @xmath227 ) , where @xmath228'$ ] .",

    "the above performance statistics suggest that the model fit is good and therefore we can proceed with control charting at phase ii ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "the first thing to do is to find a suitable ar(1 ) model for the process @xmath128 .",
    "a suitable model is the ar(1 ) : @xmath234 .",
    "according to the discussion above , we remove the intercept @xmath235 so that we can obtain a in - control process in phase i. thus we design the modified ewma control chart for @xmath236 .",
    "again we use tables for the modified ewma control chart and for @xmath153 the resulting control chart is given in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "this figure agrees with the residual chart of pan and jarrett@xmath24 , that finds the process in phase ii out of control for most of the data points . in phase",
    "i chart of panel ( b ) of figure [ fig10 ] gives one out of control point , which is in agreement with pan and jarrett@xmath24 , but in panel ( a ) of figure [ fig10 ] the control chart detects more out of control points in phase i. the ewma control chart is robust to non - normality for the low values of @xmath153 and @xmath154 , but for @xmath153 the chart is more sensitive to small shifts in the mean of @xmath128 , resulting to the detection of out of control points in phase i. any out of control points in phase i should be immediately investigated and usual spc procedures of removing influence of these points in the calculation of the control limits should be applied ( montgomery@xmath0 ) .",
    "this paper develops a new multivariate control chart based on bayes factors .",
    "this control chart is specifically aimed at multivariate autocorrelated and serially correlated processes .",
    "the general idea is to form a target distribution , to construct a predictive density with good forecast ability and then to apply a univariate control chart for the logarithm of the bayes factor of the predictive error density against the target error density .",
    "although in this paper , for simplicity , we have considered normal distributions for the target and the predictive densities , in general application the proposed control charts can be applied considering other densities too as long as they are available in analytic form .",
    "we have restricted our discussion to the modified ewma control chart , but other control charts such as the modified cusum and non - parametric control charts can be applied .",
    "a major advantage of our approach as compared to other multivariate control charts is that once we have obtained the log bayes factors we can apply any appropriate univariate control chart .",
    "a difficulty appears to be that the resulting bayes factors process is both autocorrelated and non - normal , but we believe the design of the proposed chart is a challenge that can attract and motivate further research in this so important area of statistical process control .",
    "i should like to thank the editor erik mnness and two anonymous referees for making several valuable suggestions , which considerably improved the paper .",

    "it suffices to prove that @xmath80 is unbiased estimator and that its covariance matrix converges to zero . from equations ( [ eq : var ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) we obtain @xmath237 and so @xmath80 is unbiased for @xmath35 . for the convergence ,",
    "let @xmath238 denote the column stacking operator of a lower portion of a covariance matrix and let @xmath239 denote a matrix norm defined in a suitable linear space . from equation ( [ eq5 ] )",
    "we have @xmath240 from equation ( [ eq5 ] ) @xmath97 follows a @xmath37-variate normal distribution and so by writing @xmath241'$ ] , we have that @xmath242 are bounded , since these expectations are expressed as moments of the multivariate normal distribution ( triantafyllopoulos@xmath243 ) .",
    "hence @xmath244 has finite elements and so we can write @xmath245 , for some @xmath246 . for any @xmath247 define @xmath248 $ ] ( the integral part of @xmath249 ) . from @xmath250",
    "we have that @xmath251 , for all @xmath252 .",
    "then @xmath253 for any @xmath254 .",
    "this shows that @xmath255 and so @xmath167 .",
    "proceeding now with @xmath173 we show that @xmath173 is a cauchy sequence in the real line and hence @xmath256 exists . to prove that @xmath173 is a cauchy sequence , it suffices to prove that @xmath257 , where @xmath258 denotes absolute value .",
    "first we show that exists positive integer @xmath259 such that for all @xmath254 it is @xmath260 .",
    "the proof of this is by contradiction .",
    "suppose that for all @xmath259 exists @xmath254 such that @xmath261 .",
    "without loss in generality take @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "then we see that @xmath264 , @xmath265 and likewise @xmath266 , for all @xmath267 .",
    "so we can pick @xmath268 so that we can not find any @xmath254 with @xmath261 , which contradicts the hypothesis .",
    "thus exists @xmath269 so that for all @xmath270 it is @xmath260 .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath271 from the definition of @xmath75 of equation ( [ eq : mt ] ) , we obtain @xmath272 now pick @xmath259 as in ( [ eqapp1 ] ) and define @xmath273 so that @xmath274",
    ". then @xmath275 since @xmath276 .",
    "this proves that @xmath257 and so @xmath173 is a cauchy sequence .",
    "thus @xmath256 exists and from equation ( [ eq : mt ] ) we have @xmath277 , for which we derive @xmath166 , after rejecting the negative root @xmath278 .",
