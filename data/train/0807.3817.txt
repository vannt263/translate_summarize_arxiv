    "( v ) * planet engulfment during the giant phase .",
    "the discovery of giant planets around solar type stars poses the question as to what happens when a ms star evolves into a giant and engulfs the planet ( see massaroti et al 2008 and references therein )",
    ". assuming for a typical m3iii star r@xmath46  r@xmath47 and m@xmath48  m@xmath47 , we calculate that an ingestion of a planet with a mass 0.01  m@xmath47 can speed up the rotation of the giant by up to 40   ( see paper i for more details ) .",

    "the statistical tests do not indicate statistically significant differences between symbiotic k giants and metal poor giants .",
    "reasons for the fast rotation ( and/or line broadening ) observed in the spectra of metal poor giants are considered inherited rotation , induced rotation due to a stellar or planetary companion , and more recently macroturbulence ( see also carney et al .",
    "2003 , 2008b ) .    because the symbiotic stars rotate faster than the field giants , they probably can help us to understand in which cases the binarity and in which cases the planet ingestion or some other mechanism ( i.e. inherited rotation , macroturbulence ) is responsible for the fast rotation ( or line broadening ) .",
    "fast rotation should enhance the mass loss in the equatorial regions , like the disks of the classical be stars .",
    "the ir - disks of d-type symbiotics are ( probably ) a direct result of the fast rotation . a circumstellar medium that is significantly denser in the equatorial regions of the binary than at the poles is already detected in rs  oph ( bode et al .",
    "2007 ) , indicating that circumbinary disks ( non - dusty ) can also be formed in s - type symbiotics .",
    "mass - loss rates for the symbiotic giants derived from cm and mm / submm radio observations ( seaquist , krogulec & taylor 1993 ; mikoajewska , ivison & omont 2003 ) and from iras data ( kenyon , fernandez - castro & stencel 1988 ) are systematically higher than those reported for field giants .",
    "the relation between rotation and mass loss is not yet exactly quantified ( see wilkinson et al 2005 ) .",

    ", we estimate that if the symbiotic giants rotate 1.5 - 4.0 times faster than the field giants , they should have 3 - 30 times larger mass loss rates .",
    "this matches the observed values ( see fig.2 in mikolajewska , ivison & omont 2003 ) and means that the rapid rotation of the mass - donors is the likely physical reason that increases mass loss in sss over that exhibited by normal giants .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1996 ) point out that the barium and ch stars are similar to symbiotics but do not trigger symbiotic like activity . because the mass loss and/or rotation of the mass donors can be the reasons for the lack of activity , it will be interesting to measure their rotational velocities and to compare them with symbiotics and field giants .",
    "bipolar ejections ( jets ) are rare phenomena for the accreting white dwarfs in symbiotics ( e.g. leedjrv 2002 ) . among our sample of sss with known",
