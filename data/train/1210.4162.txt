    "the neutrinos play a very important role in the extremal condition in astrophysics . although photons are strongly coupled with the matter in the dense material , neutrinos are able to escape due to its weak coupling with the matter .",
    "therefore , neutrinos can be an important cooling source and significantly affect the dynamics .",
    "in addition , they can even be a heating source in several cases , e.g. , the neutrino capture process in the core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) @xcite and the neutrino annihilation in the central engine of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite . in the hot ( temperature @xmath1mev ) and dense ( density @xmath2 g @xmath3 ) gas , even neutrinos are trapped and thermalized so that the temperature of neutrinos becomes coincident with that of the matter .",
    "the surface where the neutrinos are decoupled from the matter is called `` neutrinosphere '' , which is analogous to a photosphere of photons .    due to the existence of neutrinosphere ,",
    "the spectrum of neutrinos is often assumed to be a thermal ( fermi - dirac ) distribution .",
    "however , we know , by the numerous studies of photons , that the radiation spectrum can easily be deformed from the thermal one in the propagation regime",
    ". the nonthermal radiation spectrum can be produced by the nonthermal spectrum or the different temperature of the scattering bodies .",
    "as for the case of photons , the processes that produce the nonthermal spectrum by electron scattering are called thermal compton ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bulk compton processes @xcite .",
    "the former process is driven by the electrons with different temperature from photons , while the latter is induced by electrons with the inhomogeneous velocity field . in the case of neutrinos",
    ", the bulk motion of scattering materials could lead to the similar effect and produce nonthermal component of neutrinos , which was not investigated so far .",
    "neutrino interactions with matter strongly depend on the energy of neutrinos , i.e. , the cross section @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the neutrino energy .",
    "thus , little difference of spectrum ( especially at the high - energy region ) could lead significantly different dynamics .",
    "the neutrino capture and the neutrino annihilation are critically important for the shock revival of ccsne and the jet production of grbs , respectively . as for ccsne",
    ", there are significant efforts for solving boltzmann equation of neutrinos with hydrodynamics numerically because the explosion mechanism ( particularly delayed - explosion scenario ) tremendously relies on neutrino physics .",
    "since the neutrinospheres for ccsne are basically spherical ( deformation is moderate if the rotation is not very rapid ) , the neutrino transfer can be solved with spherical symmetric background , which is reachable even for the current computer resources .",
    "in fact , hydrodynamic simulations together with neutrino boltzmann equation have been done in spherical symmetric case ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the central engine of grbs is essentially asymmetric ( e.g. , the compact object and the accretion disk system ) so that neutrino transfer should be solved with multi - dimensional treatment .",
    "although there are a few attempts to solve the neutrino radiative transfer in multidimensional manner ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the long - term dynamical simulation is still too computationally expensive so that the numerical solutions of full boltzmann equation are not accessible at the moment . because of these facts ,",
    "the neutrino interactions in the central engine of grbs are introduced with plenty of assumptions .",
    "one of them is the thermal spectrum .    among the accretion disk models , the neutrino - dominated accretion flow ( ndaf ) , in which copious neutrinos are emitted and dominates the cooling , is often discussed as a candidate of the central engine of grbs .",
    "@xcite derived the disk structure and neutrino luminosity by solving the group of equations of state , hydrodynamics , thermodynamics and microphysics in detail .",
    "the energy conversion efficiencies become extremely high ( the annihilation luminosity @xmath6 becomes as large as @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 ) for the mass accretion rate @xmath9 = 10@xmath10 s@xmath8 . however , their results are too optimistic , as they ignored neutrino opacity and overestimated the neutrino luminosity .",
    "@xcite showed that the effect of neutrino opacity becomes significant for @xmath11 s@xmath8 , and recalculated the annihilation rate including the concept of neutrinosphere .",
    "they demonstrated that the @xmath6 increases up to its maximum value of @xmath12 erg s@xmath8 at @xmath13 s@xmath8 and decrease for larger @xmath14 .",
    "thus they concluded that the neutrino annihilation in ndaf is not a sufficient mechanism for liberating large amount of energy .",
    "@xcite performed axisymmetric simulation of the collapsar and found that the neutrino annihilation is less important than neutrino capture as a heating source .",
    "these negative results could come from the assumption employed in their calculation , i.e. , they neglected the neutrino emission from the region with neutrino optical depth @xmath15 and employed a thermal distribution with a single temperature for the neutrino spectrum .    in this paper , multiple scattering of neutrinos and",
    "the acceleration ( i.e. , up scattering ) in a fluid flow is considered .",
    "we investigate the impact to the pair - annihilation rate by accelerated component of neutrinos .",
    "note that although in this paper we consider the parameter regime for the collapsar scenario that is one of promising candidates of long - duration grbs , the neutrino acceleration process , however , is viable for the central engine of short grbs .",
    "thus , the following is applicable both for long and short grbs .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : neutrinosphere ] , we briefly review the concept of neutrinosphere . in ",
    "[ sec : radiative ] , we describe the radiative transfer equation for neutrinos and show that its solution contains nonthermal component . in  [ sec : annihilation ] we investigate the effect of nonthermal component of neutrino on the neutrino - annihilation rate .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss their implications in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "there are three types of neutrinosphere , which are determined by the different micro processes ( see * ? ? ?",
    ", we explain these `` neutrinospheres '' one by one :    * * number sphere * : the optical depth by the emission and absorption of neutrinos is about unity . as for @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "the electron / positron capture and its inverse process ( i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) are important processes . as for @xmath20 , which represents heavier leptonic neutrinos and their antineutrinos ( i.e. , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , the pair production / annihilation processes ( i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) determine the opacity . * * energy sphere * : the inelastic scattering by electron is important process here .",
    "the electrons receive the energy from neutrinos because the electron rest mass energy ( 511 kev ) is much smaller than the typical neutrino energy ( @xmath0 mev ) , which is determined by the matter temperature at the number sphere . inside the energy sphere",
    "the neutrinos are thermalized due to energy transfer with electrons , which are tightly coupled with baryons . *",
    "* transport sphere * : beyond the energy sphere , the elastic scattering by nucleons and nuclei is dominant source of the opacity . because the rest mass energy of these particles is much larger than neutrino energy ,",
    "these scattering can be treated as the elastic scattering .. ]    as for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , all neutrinospheres provided above are almost coincident so that the spectrum is almost thermal . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath20 has distinct radii of neutrinospheres @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 could have nonthermal component , which would be produced between energy and transport spheres .",
    "here we consider the neutrino radiative transfer on the background of hyperaccreting matter .",
    "we focus on the region between the energy sphere and the transport sphere , where the scattering by nucleons dominates the opacity .      here , we briefly describe profiles of matter as a background of neutrino radiative transfer . in this calculation",
    ", we employ the spherically symmetric accretion flow in order to mimic the collapsar .",
    "let @xmath9 be the rate at which matter is accreting , and let its radial inward speed be @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the speed of light and @xmath28 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "this free - fall velocity profile makes the implicit assumption that the radiation force on the accreting matter is insignificant or equivalently , that the escaping luminosity is much less than the eddington value .",
    "the scattering optical depth of the flow from a radius @xmath29 to infinity is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the nucleon number density ( @xmath32 $ ] ) , @xmath33 is the scattering cross section for neutrino energy @xmath5 , and the dimensionless mass accretion rate @xmath34 , respectively . here , @xmath35 is the eddington accretion rate defined by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the eddington luminosity of neutrinos , @xmath38 is the mass of the central object , @xmath39 is the proton mass , and @xmath40 is the gravitational constant . since @xmath41 depends on the neutrino energy , we introduce @xmath42 , which represents @xmath41 for @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 being boltzmann constant and the matter temperature .    for supercritical accretion into black holes ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_sc ] ) that there should be regions in the flow where the neutrinos propagate diffusively . for our problem , it is convenient to use not @xmath47 but the effective optical depth @xmath48 this value will replace the radial coordinate @xmath29 in the radiative transfer equation in  [ subsec : radiative_transfer ] .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath49 depends on @xmath5 as well due to the energy dependence of the scattering cross section .",
    "in addition , we introduce the dimensionless neutrino energy as @xmath50      now we proceed to write down and solve the radiative transfer equation . for the kinetic equation , we start from equation ( 18 ) of @xcite for the neutrino occupation number @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the inverse of the scattering mean free path and @xmath54 is the emissivity . here",

    "the relevant solution can be evaluated as an infinite sum of generalized laguerre polynomials @xmath69 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath70 are given by @xmath71 these values are different from @xcite because the cross section depends on energy for the current case . note that this spectral index does not imply the observable spectrum at a certain radius because @xmath49 depends on not only a radius but also the considered neutrino energy ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tau ] ) . in order to obtain a spectral flux at @xmath29",
    ", we should multiply eq . by @xmath72 because @xmath73 for @xmath67 ( the other terms drop faster than this term ) .",
    "thus , the hardest spectral component ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) of @xmath75 becomes @xmath76 .    in principle , the global solution of eq . can be given by summing up infinite series expressed by @xmath77 with coefficients determined by the boundary condition .",
    "in fact , @xcite gave the analytic solution with the delta - function distribution function at the injection optical depth , in which all coefficients are expressed by generalized laguerre polynomials and gamma functions ( see eqs .",
    "10 and 11 in their paper ) . however , the analytic expression for the arbitrary boundary condition is not always representable using known functions .",
    "thus , in the following we solve eq .",
    "numerically with the thermal distributions of neutrinos at the energy sphere as a boundary condition .      in this subsection",
    ", we present our numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinetic_nodim ] ) .",
    "the last term is omitted again because the interested region is between the energy sphere and transport sphere ( see  [ sec : neutrinosphere ] ) .",

    "needless to say , we should care about the normalization with detailed source term because neutrino is fermion so that there is a significant effect by pauli blocking for @xmath91 .    in figure",

    "the total cross section of neutron - neutrino elastic scattering is @xmath130 the reason why we employ the cross section for neutrons is that due to the electron capture ( @xmath131 ) the neutron fraction increases , whereas the proton fraction decreases inside the neutrinosphere .",

    "since @xmath133 is definitely @xmath138 at the energy sphere , @xmath139 the typical temperature of neutrinospheres is @xmath140 mev @xcite so that @xmath47 is larger than @xmath138 for neutrinos of the energy @xmath141 mev .",
    "the typical value of @xmath142 is @xmath143 at the region where the electron capture is significant so that almost all the neutrinos are trapped by the nucleon elastic scattering at the energy sphere .",

    "next , we discuss about the neutrino species . in this paper , we consider the region between the energy sphere and the transport sphere , i.e. the optical depth is larger than unity for the neutrino - nucleon elastic scattering .",
    "note that usually these neutrino spheres are coincident for @xmath16 and @xmath17 due to the presence of the charged current for these neutrinos so that the neutrino acceleration studied in this paper is possible only for @xmath144 , @xmath145 and their anti particles .",
    "however , for the case of neutron number density being much larger than protons one , the charged current reaction of @xmath17 ( @xmath146 ) is negligible so that the reactions relevant to @xmath147 become similar to those of heavier leptonic neutrinos .",

    "therefore , it is expected that the acceleration of @xmath157 would naturally occur in the collapsar system .",
    "our finding suggests that the detectability of mev neutrinos is also enhanced because the expected detection number @xmath158 .",
    "if this neutrino acceleration works only for @xmath159 , the neutrino oscillation would produce @xmath157 , which is main observable for walter erenkov detectors .",
    "@xcite estimated the expected number from the hyperaccreting accretion flow with thermal spectrum of @xmath160 mev and argued that grbs are observable for @xmath161 a few mpc by super - kamiokande and several mpc by mton detector .",
    "the neutrino acceleration process thought in this paper would push out the detectable horizon of mev neutrino farther .",
    "at last , we comment on our assumptions in this study .",
    "firstly , we employed the diffusion limit for whole region , which is not valid for optically thin region , @xmath162 1 .",
    "the conclusion , however , does not change if we somehow include effects of optically thinness , since the spectral evolution is determined by the region @xmath163 1 .",
    "secondly , we dropped out the recoil term from the kinetic equation .",
    "the average energy of neutrinos is not affected by this because the recoil term changes the spectrum for @xmath164 gev which is much higher than the typical energy of neutrino spectrum .",
    "thus , if we include the recoil term ( that is much more complicated than terms included in this study ) , the conclusion does not change very much .",
    "thirdly , we fixed the background matter flow as free fall .",
    "the energy gain of neutrinos must come from the matter so that the back reaction should be included when the total energy of neutrinos reaches as large as the matter kinetic energy . to compare these two quantities ,",
    "more detailed source term is necessary .",
    "the final answer can be obtained by solving neutrino radiation hydrodynamic equations in self - consistent way , which is far beyond the scope of this simple study .",
    "fourthly , we omitted the relativistic effects , e.g. , the doppler shift and gravitational redshift . in order to include these effects , we should reformulate by covariant formulation of the radiative transfer in self - consistent way .",
    "one can find such a formulation in @xcite .",
    "finally , the spherical symmetry is also one of the largest assumption in this study .",
    "this assumption is partially valid because ndaf solution has large disk height due to the large contribution of gas for pressure ( otherwise if the disk is supported by the centrifugal force , the disk height is almost negligible compared to the disk radius ) . considering the disk structure ,",
    "neutrinos can escape from the accretion flow to the vertical direction before the spectral evolution completes . whether this effect amplifies or suppresses",
    "the neutrino annihilation is not trivial because there are two possible opposite effects ; neutrinos emitted at deep position , which are experienced significant acceleration , can more easily escape than the spherically symmetric configuration , while the acceleration might not complete due to the earlier escape . to give more concrete result , more detailed calculation is strongly required .",
