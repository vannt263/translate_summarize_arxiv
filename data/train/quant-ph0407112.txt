    "apparently very different systems as high - gain free electron laser ( fel ) @xcite and collective atomic recoil laser ( carl ) @xcite exhibit similar behaviors , showing self - bunching and exponential enhancement of the emitted radiation . originally conceived in a semiclassical framework , they can be as well described quantum - mechanically @xcite .",
    "however , it is not explicitly evident how to obtain the classical limit starting from the quantum description .",
    "first attempts to give a quantum description of the fel have been proposed in the 80s , starting from a canonical quantization of the @xmath3-particle hamiltonian in the heisenberg picture , to study photon statistics and quantum initialization from vacuum in the linear regime @xcite . in 1988 , preparata proposed a quantum field theory of fel @xcite , in which he has shown that , for @xmath4 , the fel dynamics is solved by a single - electron schrdinger equation coupled to a self - consistent radiation mode .",
    "the same model has been recently obtained to describe carl from a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been also proved experimentally @xcite that carl in a bec exhibits quantum recoil effects when the average recoil velocity remains less than the photon recoil limit .    in this letter",
    "we start from the classical model describing both carls and fels and we extend it to the quantum realm showing the correspondence between the preparata model @xcite and the carl - bec model @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is possible to derive an equation for the wigner function of the @xmath3-particle system .",
    "the wigner function obeys to a finite difference equation which reduces to the classical vlasov equation @xcite in the limit in which the number of photons emitted per particle is much larger than unity . in the opposite limit ,",
    "both carls and fels behave as a two - state system @xcite described by the well - known maxwell - bloch equations @xcite .",
    "apparently the physics of fel and carl appears to be quite different .",
    "the first describes a relativistic high current electron beam with energy @xmath5 , injected in a magnet ( wiggler ) with a transverse , static magnetic field @xmath6 and periodicity @xmath7 , which radiates in the forward direction at the wavelength @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the wiggler parameter and @xmath10 . instead , carl consists of a collection of two level atoms in a high - q ring cavity driven by a far - detuned laser pump of frequency @xmath11 which radiates at the frequency @xmath12 in the direction opposite to the pump . in both cases",
    "the radiation process arises from a collective instability which originates a symmetry breaking in the spatial distribution , _",
    "i.e. _ a self - bunching of particles which group in regions smaller than the wavelength .",
    "it can be shown that , under suitable conditions and introducing proper dimensionless variables , the dynamics of both fels and carls is described by the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath13-\\frac{\\delta}{\\bar \\rho}\\ ; a^{\\dag } a , \\label{ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the phase operator of the @xmath16-th particle and its conjugate momentum operator , obeying @xmath17=i\\delta_{jj'}$ ] . in eq.([ham ] ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are annihilation and creation operators for the forward radiation mode photon , with @xmath20=1 $ ] .",
    "notice that the dynamics described by eq.([ham ] ) depends only on the parameter @xmath21 and on the detuning @xmath22 , properly defined for the two systems :    * for fels , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the resonant energy and @xmath27 is the bpn parameter for a fel @xcite , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . * for carls , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the recoil frequency , @xmath34 , @xmath35 $ ]",
    ", @xmath36 is the pump rabi frequency , @xmath37 is the pump - atom detuning , @xmath38 is natural decay constant of the atomic transition and @xmath39 is the dipole matrix element @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the longitudinal atomic velocity .    in these definitions",
    ", @xmath43 is the particle density in the radiation volume @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the particle mass .",
    "notice that in both cases @xmath46 scales as @xmath47 , i.e. as the reciprocal of the inter - particle distance . introducing @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the heisenberg equations associated with eq.([ham ] )",
    "are @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 for carl whereas @xmath53 for fel . considering the operators @xmath14 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in eqs.([c1])-([c3 ] ) as c - numbers , one obtain the well - known classical description for fel and carl .",
    "the scaling of eqs.([c1])-([c3 ] ) is called ` universal ' in the sense that , assuming resonance ( _ i.e. _ @xmath56 ) , the equations do not contain any parameter .",
    "hence , the scaling law of the various physical quantities can be obtained from their definition in term of @xmath21 . in particular , from the definition of @xmath55 and @xmath57 it follows that the photon number per particle and the momentum recoil are proportional to @xmath21 , both for fels and carls .",
    "hence , it is expected that when @xmath1 the system behaves classically , whereas for @xmath2 quantum effects becomes relevant .",
    "notice that @xmath58 is a constant of motion in eqs.([c1])-([c3 ] ) , _ i.e. _ the radiated intensity is due to the average recoil .",
    "in ref . @xcite preparata , using quantum field theory , has shown that the collective dynamics of the system of @xmath59 electrons in an fel can be described by means of a single complex scalar quantum field whose behavior is governed by a schrdinger - type equation in the self - consistent radiation field , which originates a pendulum - like potential : @xmath60\\psi \\label{psi}\\\\ \\frac{da}{d\\tau}&=&\\int_{0}^{2\\pi } d\\theta|\\psi|^2e^{-i\\theta}+\\frac{i\\delta}{\\bar\\rho}a , \\label{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is normalized to one , i.e. @xmath62 . note that eq.([psi ] ) is the schrdinger equation associated to the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) and eq.([a ] ) corresponds to eq.([c3 ] ) when the classical average of @xmath63 is replaced by the quantum ensemble average . quoting ref .",
    "@xcite , eqs.([psi ] ) and ( [ a ] ) are derived if one `` formulate the many - electron problem in the language of quantum field theory and uses the large number @xmath3 of electrons to evaluate the resulting path integral by saddle - point techniques '' .",
    "recently , the same model of eqs.([psi ] ) and ( [ a ] ) has been used to describe carl from a bec * @xcite*. hence , we propose the nonlinear system of eqs.([psi ] ) and ( [ a ] ) as the quantum extension of the carl - fel classical model .",
    "we now show that the classical equations ( [ c1])-([c3 ] ) are recovered in the limit @xmath64 .",
    "let s consider the standard definition of the wigner function for a state with wave function @xmath65 : @xmath66 so that @xmath67 one can show that eq.([psi ] ) is equivalent to the following finite difference equation for the quasi - probability distribution @xmath68 : @xmath69 \\left [ w\\left(\\theta,\\bar p+\\frac{1}{\\bar \\rho } , \\tau\\right ) - w\\left(\\theta,\\bar p - \\frac{1}{\\bar \\rho } , \\tau\\right ) \\right ] = 0.\\ ] ] using eq .",
    "( [ w : psi ] ) , eq . ( [ a ] ) becomes : @xmath70 we underline again that eqs.([weqn ] ) and ( [ a : w ] ) are equivalent to eqs.([psi ] ) and ( [ a ] ) using the wigner function representation . in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ weqn ] ) , the incremental ratio @xmath71/(2\\epsilon)\\rightarrow \\partial w(\\theta,\\bar p)/\\partial\\bar p$ ] when @xmath72 . hence , for @xmath1 eq .",
    "( [ weqn ] ) becomes the vlasov equation : @xmath73 \\frac{\\partial w(\\theta,\\bar p,\\tau)}{\\partial\\bar p } = 0.\\ ] ] eqs .",
    "( [ a : w ] ) and ( [ vlasov ] ) are equivalent to the classical eqs .",
    "( [ c1])-([c3 ] ) .",
    "this means that the particles behave classically , following a newtonian motion , when @xmath1 i.e. when the average number of photons scattered per particle is much larger than unity . in this limit ,",
    "the quantum recoil effects due to the single photon scattering process is negligible . on the contrary",
    ", a quantum regime of carl or fel occurs when @xmath2 , in which each particle scatters only one photon .    ) and ( [ a3 ] ) for @xmath74 ( first row ) , @xmath75 ( second row ) and @xmath76 ( third row ) .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . left column : dimensionless radiation intensity @xmath80 vs. @xmath81 ; central and right column : occupation probabilities @xmath82 vs. @xmath83 and density distribution @xmath84 vs. @xmath85 , for @xmath81 near the first maximum of @xmath80.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in fact , expanding the wave function in fourier series as @xmath86 and inserting this ansatz in eqs.([psi ] ) and ( [ a ] ) , one can easily obtain the following closed set of equations for @xmath87 : @xmath88\\label{w3}\\\\ \\frac{d\\bar{a}}{d\\tau}&=&\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\varrho_{n-1,n } , \\label{a3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 .",
    "these equations are equivalent to eqs.([psi ] ) and ( [ a ] ) for the density matrix in the momentum representation and have been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "fig.[figura1 ] shows the numerical solution of eq.([w3 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) for @xmath74 ( first row ) , @xmath75 ( second row ) and @xmath76 ( third row ) .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath77 , which corresponds to a single photon scattering recoil . in the first column @xmath80",
    "is plotted as a function of @xmath81 .",
    "the central column shows the occupation probabilities @xmath82 vs. @xmath83 , whereas the right column shows the density distribution @xmath84 vs. @xmath85 , for a value of @xmath81 near the first maximum of @xmath80 .",
    "we note that for @xmath74 the system behaves classically : the momentum states are occupied in a range of the order of @xmath21 and the average momentum is @xmath90 , as can be seen from the first row of fig.[figura1 ] .",
    "furthermore , the particle distribution shows periodic narrow peaks of density .",
    "when @xmath75 , the mainly occupied momentum states are those for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , corresponding to particles in the initial state or in the recoil state , respectively . finally , when @xmath93 , the dynamics is that of a pure two - level system .",
    "in this limit , if the initially occupied state is the @xmath83th momentum state , the only two momentum states involved in the interaction are those for @xmath83 and @xmath94 , so that eq.([w3 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) , after defining the ` polarization ' @xmath95 and the ` population difference ' @xmath96 , reduce to the maxwell - bloch equations for a two - state system @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . with this new",
    "scaling and assuming resonance ( i.e. @xmath101 ) , eqs.([s])-([a:4 ] ) do not contain any parameter .",
    "hence , the characteristic timescale is ruled by @xmath102 instead of @xmath47 as in the classical case .",
    "the quantum regime for carls and fels is analog to the coherent spontaneous emission regime predicted quantum - mechanically for a two - level system in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a series of optical `` @xmath103-pulses '' are generated .",
    "in fact , assuming resonance ( i.e. @xmath101 ) , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are real . hence , we can introduce the `` bloch angle '' @xmath106 such that @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "then , eqs.([s])-([a:4 ] ) reduce to a pendulum equation @xmath109 and @xmath110 . hence , in the quantum regime",
    ", the dynamics is that of a pendulum moving away from the unstable equilibrium point ( @xmath111 ) and undergoing periodically a complete revolution ( @xmath103-pulse ) with angular velocity @xmath104 .    finally , we note that , adopting the same scaling of eqs.([s])-([a:4 ] ) in eq.([psi ] ) ,",
    "this can be interpreted as a schrdinger equation for a single particle with a `` mass '' @xmath112 in a self - consistent pendulum potential .",
    "this provides an intuitive interpretation of the classical limit , that holds when the particle s mass is large .",
    "the strong differences between the quantum and classical regimes are evident from fig.[figura1 ] .",
    "in this letter we presented a unified quantum model that stands for apparently very different systems as fel and carl .",
    "the dynamics is described by a schrdinger equation in a self - consistent pendulum potential and is ruled by an unique parameter @xmath21 which represents the maximum number of photons scattered per particle and the maximum momentum recoil in units of the photon recoil momentum .",
    "the schrdinger equation can be transformed in an exact equation for the wigner quasi - probability distribution .",
    "the main results are the following : i ) the classical model is recovered in the limit @xmath113 ; this because the finite difference equation for the wigner function reduces to the classical vlasov equation .",
    "ii ) in the limit @xmath114 a completely different dynamical regime occurs ( see fig . [ figura1 ] ) : due to momentum quantization the system reduces to only two momentum states obeying to the maxwell - bloch equations which describe the dynamics of a two - level atomic system coupled to a coherent field .",
    "one of us ( rb ) has to acknowledge a big mistake he made almost 20 years ago when giuliano preparata , a well - known field theorist , presented to him his general `` quantum field theory of a free electron laser '' @xcite .",
    "rb did not understand this work thinking it was incorrect . on the contrary ,",
    "preparata s theory was perfectly correct , as recognized in this letter , which is dedicated to his memory .",
