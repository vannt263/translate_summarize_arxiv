    "in the spring of 1998 arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add )  @xcite , later joined by antoniadis  @xcite , proposed a possible solution to the hierarchy problem of high - energy physics . in the add scenario the electroweak scale ( @xmath0 tev ) is identified with the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory .",
    "unification of electroweak and planck scales takes place at @xmath1 1 tev .",
    "gravity becomes strong at the electroweak scale and neither supersymmetry nor technicolor are required to achieve radiative stability .",
    "the idea that the gravitational scale can be lowered by some unknown physics dates back to the early 90 s when antoniadis  @xcite first proposed that perturbative string theories generally predict the existence of extra dimensions at energies of order of the tev scale . in presence of large extra dimensions   ( leds ) the observed weakness of gravity is a consequence of the `` leakage '' of gravity in the extra dimensions .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) fields are constrained in a four - dimensional submanifold of the higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the success of the sm up to energies of a few hundreds of gev indeed requires sm fields to be localized on a three - brane embedded in the extra dimensions  @xcite . on the contrary , gravity and other non - sm fields",
    "are allowed to freely propagate outside the three - brane .",
    "the recognition of the add scenario as a feasible model of high - energy physics was soon boosted by the possibility of including the add model in a consistent theory of quantum gravity ( qg ) : string theory ( st ) . in the past years st  @xcite has emerged as the most successful candidate for a consistent theory of qg .",
    "the most recent understanding of st entails that the five consistent sts and 11-dimensional supergravity ( sugra ) are connected by a web of duality transformations .",
    "type i , ii and heterotic sts , and 11-dimensional sugra constitute special points of a large , multi - dimensional moduli space of a more fundamental nonperturbative theory , called @xmath2-theory .",
    "in addition to strings , the nonperturbative formulation of st predicts the existence of higher - dimensional , nonperturbative extended objects ( @xmath3-branes )  @xcite .",
    "the presence of branes in the theory leads naturally to the localization of the sm fields and to the hierarchy in the size of the extra dimensions which are postulated in the add scenario  .",
    "therefore , tev - scale gravity can be successfully realized in st  @xcite .",
    "the attractiveness of the add proposal promptly opened up a whole new field of investigation which is evident in the explosion of papers appeared in the literature . within months",
    "dienes , dudas and gherghetta  @xcite investigated the effects of extra dimensions on the gut scale .",
    "giudice , rattazzi and wells  @xcite , and mirabelli , perelstein and peskin  @xcite studied the consequences of leds for high - energy collider experiments .",
    "han , lykken and zhang  @xcite , and hewett  @xcite , studied low - energy phenomenology of tev - scale kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes .",
    "argyres , dimopoulos and march - russell  @xcite , and kaloper and linde @xcite , investigated the properties of black holes ( bhs ) and inflation in the led scenario , respectively .",
    "randall and sundrum proposed an alternative solution to the hierarchy problem based on the existence of warped extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "afterward , the number of papers on the subject has increased dramatically .",
    "the presence of leds affects both sub- and super - planckian physics .",
    "sub - planckian physics is essentially affected by the presence of kk modes  @xcite .",
    "the coupling of kk states to sm particles leads to deviations from sm predictions in perturbative processes such as quarkonium radiative decays , two- and four - fermion interactions and production of gauge bosons . in the led scenario",
    "effective interactions resulting from massive kk modes are suppressed by powers of the fundamental planck mass @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to significant experimental signatures .",
    "super - planckian physics   involves non - perturbative effects .",
    "the most striking super - planckian phenomenon is the formation of non - perturbative gravitational objects ( npgos ) from hard - scattering processes .",
    "creation of bhs from super - planckian scattering was advocated by banks and fischler  @xcite soon after the appearance of the papers on non - perturbative sub - planckian effects .",
    "particle collisions with center - of - mass ( cm ) energy larger than the fundamental planck mass , and impact parameter smaller than the schwarzchild radius associated with the cm energy , are expected to generate bhs .",
    "a completely inelastic process creates a single bh which subsequently decays via hawking radiation  @xcite and can be regarded as an intermediate metastable state in the super - planckian scattering .",
    "bh formation is expected to dominate hard - scattering processes because the number of non - perturbative states grows faster than the number of perturbative string states .",
    "moreover , the cross - section for bh formation grows with energy faster than cross - sections of non - perturbative sub - planckian processes .",
    "formation and evaporation of super - planckian bhs would be detectable in future hadron colliders  @xcite such the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite or the very large hadron collider ( vhlc )  @xcite .",
    "ultra high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) impacting earth s atmosphere with cm energy of a few hundreds of tev  @xcite could also produce transient bhs  @xcite that would account for features in the spectrum of uhecr  @xcite and be observed in neutrino telescopes  @xcite , ground array and air fluorescence detectors  @xcite .",
    "if super - planckian collisions create npgos , production of spherically symmetric bhs is just the simplest of a plethora of possible super - planckian physical processes . at planckian or super - planckian energies",
    ", we also expect creation of other npgo which are predicted by qg theories .",
    "@xmath5-branes are @xmath5-dimensional spatially extended solutions of gravitational theories in higher dimensions , such as higher - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory  @xcite or low - energy effective sts  @xcite .",
    "they are translationally invariant in @xmath5-dimensions and isotropic in the @xmath6 spatial directions transverse to the translationally - symmetric ones , i.e. , @xmath5-branes preserve the @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "therefore , they can be viewed as poincar - invariant hyperplanes propagating in spacetime .",
    "@xmath5-branes are characterized by the tension @xmath8 , the mass @xmath9 and a set of conserved charges .",
    "they possess naked singularities and/or horizons . in the former case",
    "@xmath5-brane solutions are interpreted as the exterior metric of higher - dimensional extended objects such as ( cosmic ) strings  @xcite . in the latter , they are usually called `` black '' branes because their geometry is that of a @xmath10-dimensional hole @xmath11 @xmath5-dimensional hyperplane .",
    "a @xmath12-brane is a spherically symmetric bh .",
    "branes are a generic phenomenon of any gravitational theory .",
    "the presence of extra dimensions is indeed sufficient to permit the existence of these extended objects , though their physical properties depend on the theory .",
    "therefore , if the fundamental planck scale is of order of tev , it is reasonable to expect creation of branes at energies above the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "super - planckian physics is affected by the production of bhs and @xmath5-branes alike .",
    "tev - branes can produce experimental signatures in particle colliders  @xcite and in uhecr physics  @xcite .",
    "in cosmology , primordial creation of stable branes may have played an important role in the dynamics of the very early universe when the temperature was above the tev scale ; brane relics could be the observed dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to review the theory and the phenomenology of bh and brane production in led gravity and present an up - to - date bibliography on the subject . in the next section we will review the basic features of tev - scale gravity and led models .",
    "the physics of brane formation in tev - scale gravity follows closely that of bhs .",
    "therefore , we first discuss bh creation in led models in sect .  3 .",
    "sections 4 - 7 deal with tev - branes . in sect .  4 we review brane solutions in einstein - maxwell and low - energy sts and discuss their formation and basic properties .",

    "if st is the ultimate theory of qg , six or seven dimensions must be compactified to yield a four - dimensional effective action .",
    "this is generally accomplished by assuming that the higher - dimensional spacetime is a ( warped ) product of four - dimensional minkowski spacetime and a compact @xmath35-dimensional riemannian manifold .",
    "the spacetime metric is ds^2 = g_ab(x)dx^a dx^b= e^2a(y)dx^dx^_+h_ij(y)dy^idy^j , [ gen - metric ] where the greek indices run from @xmath12 to @xmath36 and the coordinates @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) parametrize the compactified dimensions .",
