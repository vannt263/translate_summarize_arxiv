    "we study the dynamics of two - color beams in a nonlinear isotropic medium .",
    "we take the initial conditions to be a one - color beam with gaussian profile . with a cubic ( @xmath0 ) nonlinearity , which is the lowest order possible in an isotropic medium , the possible nonlinearities are thg , kerr , and raman .",
    "any other nonlinearity requires either a different susceptibility ( second - harmonics , high - harmonics ) , or more than two slowly - varying envelopes ( sum and difference frequency generation ) .",
    "this is one of the simplest nonlinear optics problems , and is for that reason important ; it has an application to third - harmonic generation ( thg ) microscopy @xcite .",
    "the usual model of thg takes the fundamental beam to be gaussian , and ( inconsistently , or as an approximation ) has thg as the sole nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "this model has exact analytic solution in which the third - harmonic ( th ) beam takes a gaussian profile . for a phase - mismatch that is zero or negative",
    ", the energy in the th peaks at the focus of the fundamental beam , and , after the focus , destructive interference causes _ all _ the th to be re - absorbed by the fundamental . the latter is often said to be due to the guoy shift @xcite , the phase - shift of @xmath1 that a gaussian beam experiences in going from a far - field , through a focus , to a far - field .",
    "but , in fact , the details show it to depend on the beam s phase and shape everywhere along its path . however , the fast ( electronic ) nonlinear response of optical materials that yields thg also generates kerr effects ( self- and cross - phase modulation ) .",
    "therefore , one should include kerr and perhaps also raman effects when modeling thg .",
    "these can have quite drastic effects on a beam @xcite .",
    "although it was recognized as early as 1973 that kerr effects could influence thg @xcite , and although kerr , thg , and dispersion have been examined in studies _ without _ transverse spatial dynamics @xcite , the results of transverse nonlinear dynamics on thg have not heretofore been studied in quantitative detail .    we have derived a set of coupled nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations for two slowly - varying envelopes , with the relevant nonlinearities treated rigorously and consistently @xcite . because of the microscopy application , we are interested in very tightly focused beams and pulses , with large momentum and frequency spreads .",
    "the nls equations are thus given to all orders in dispersion and diffraction ; numerical simulations are carried out with a method that is accurate to all orders relevant for the grid @xcite .",
