    "the mathematical field that deals with derivatives of any real order is called fractional calculus . for a long time , it was only considered as a pure mathematical branch . nevertheless , during the last two decades , fractional calculus has attracted the attention of many researchers and it has been successfully applied in various areas like computational biology @xcite or economy @xcite . in particular , the first and well - established application of fractional operators was in the physical context of anomalous diffusion , see @xcite for example . here",
    "we can mention @xcite , demonstrating that fractional equations work as a complementary tool in the description of anomalous transport processes .",
    "let us refer to @xcite for a general review of the applications of fractional calculus in several fields of physics . in a more general point of view , fractional differential equations are even considered as an alternative model to non - linear differential equations , see @xcite .",
    "+ recently , a subtopic of the fractional calculus gains importance : the calculus of variations with lagrangian functionals involving fractional derivatives .",
    "this leads to the statement of fractional euler ",
    "lagrange equations , see @xcite .",
    "this idea was introduced by riewe in 1996 - 97 @xcite in view of finding fractional variational structures for non conservative differential equations .",
    "one can find a similar and more conclusive reasoning in @xcite .",
    "for the state of the art on the fractional calculus of variations , we refer the reader to the recent book @xcite . for optimal control problems with stochastic equations driven by fractional noise , see @xcite and references therein . + fractional euler ",
    "lagrange equations characterize the critical points of fractional lagrangian functionals and consequently , they are necessary optimality conditions for optimizers . nevertheless , despite particular results in @xcite ,",
    "no general existence results of an optimizer are provided in the literature .",
    "this is a reason why we have provided in @xcite sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of a minimizer for fractional lagrangian functionals in the riemann  liouville and caputo senses .",
    "let us remind that , in these two previous papers , the method developed is widely inspired from @xcite where general existence results of a minimizer for classical lagrangian functionals are provided .",
    "+ there exist many notions of fractional integrals and derivatives .",
    "we can cite the notions of riemann  liouville , hadamard , caputo and grnwald  letnikov , see @xcite . in consequence , there exist a lot of versions of fractional euler  lagrange equations .",
    "an unifying perspective to the subject is possible by considering general linear operators , like kernel operators @xcite . in @xcite , authors are then interested in the calculus of variations with lagrangian functionals involving general operators .",

    "unfortunately , once again , no general existence results are provided for this unifying framework .",
