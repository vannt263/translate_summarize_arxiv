    "the energy levels of lanthanide ions in solids , which give rise to transitions from the uv to the ir regions of the electromagnetic spectrum , have important applications , such as lighting , lasers and scintillators .",
    "the vast majority of energy - level calculations for these materials make use of a `` crystal - field '' hamiltonian , though there have been some _ ab initio _ calculations @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian was originally developed for the @xmath5 configuration of lanthanide ions @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to actinides and extended to include the @xmath6 configuration of both divalent @xcite , and trivalent @xcite lanthanide ions .",
    "spectra involving the @xmath6 configuration are generally in the uv and vuv region . due to changes in bonding , and hence bond length , between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , transitions between configurations generally involve broad vibronic bands , though in materials with heavy ligands it is possible to observe vibronic progressions , particularly for divalent ions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath6 configuration , other excited configurations play a role in high - energy spectra .",
    "the @xmath7 configuration generally overlaps the @xmath6 configuration @xcite , and there are also states involving charge transfer between the lanthanide and the other ions in the material .",
    "charge can be transferred from a ligand to the lanthanide , giving broad charge - transfer absorption bands @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "charge from the lanthanide may become delocalized , leading to an impurity trapped exciton state ( ite ) .",
    "the delocalization gives a very large change in bond length relative to the @xmath5 configuration and so these states may sometimes be directly observed by their broad , red - shifted , `` anomalous '' emission bands @xcite , and are also thought to play a crucial role in non - radiative relaxation from states in the @xmath6 configuration @xcite .    there is little direct knowledge of the electronic and geometrical structure of ites in lanthanide materials .",
    "we have recently reported the use of two - colour ( uv - ir ) excitation to probe the energy - level structure of ites in the caf@xmath8:yb@xmath1 system @xcite .",
    "the energy levels of the ite were modelled using a simple crystal - field model where the localized @xmath9 electrons were coupled to an @xmath10 electron , since the delocalized electron would be expected to be hybridized yb@xmath1 @xmath11 and ca@xmath1 @xmath12 orbitals .",
    "ite states have also been a subject of _ ab initio _ calculations in various materials @xcite .",
    "relevant to this paper , these calculations determine potential energy curves of the electronic states of the materials involved .",
    "the most comprehensive calculation is for the srcl@xmath8:yb@xmath1 system @xcite .",
    "this material does not exhibit excitonic emission @xcite , but the absorption bands vary considerably in width @xcite , indicating that the excited states do not all have the same equilibrium bond length . in the calculations of snchez - sanz",
    "@xcite there is a double - well energy curve for some states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eplot ] . at long anion - cation separations",
    "these states have predominantly @xmath11 character , but at shorter distances they become @xmath13 symmetry combinations composed of @xmath14 orbitals on the next - nearest - neighbor sr@xmath1 ions , with a contribution from interstitial charge density .",
    "the combined @xmath15 configuration has @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "it was demonstrated by snchez - sanz et al .",
    "@xcite that all of the states were crucial in explaining the different band - widths observed in the absorption spectrum @xcite . in this calculation",
    "the @xmath16 potential curve minima have higher energies than the minima of the @xmath11 or @xmath17 states , but could be described as a `` precursor '' to the exciton states that occurs in srf@xmath0:yb@xmath1 and caf@xmath0:yb@xmath1 at lower energy than the @xmath18 configuration @xcite .",

    "the @xmath20 curve , which has a minimum at 2.954   , is omitted . ]    the calculations of snchez - sanz et al .",
    "@xcite were directly compared with absorption @xcite and emission @xcite spectra .",
    "while this gives a good match to the data , it does not provide information directly about the magnitudes of the physical interactions involved , and hence this calculation can not be compared to the crystal - field calculation of pan et al .",
    "the advantage of determining the crystal - field parameters of the system is that the corresponding interactions have predictable behavior across the lanthanide series , allowing for the parameters determined for this system to be extrapolated to other lanthanide systems . in simple systems with high symmetry and one valence electron , such as the baf@xmath8:ce@xmath21 system",
    "@xcite it is relatively easy to relate the energy levels to crystal - field parameters .",
    "however , for a many - electron system such as srcl@xmath0:yb@xmath1 the relationship is much more complicated because there are many more parameters in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "recent work has shown that it is possible to construct an effective hamiltonian matrix from _ ab initio _ calculations , and hence determine crystal - field and other parameters by a straightforward projection technique  @xcite . there",
    "the relevant parameters were extracted directly from the _ ab initio _ hamiltonian .",
    "however , those works were on systems with a single valence electron . in systems with more than one valence electron",
    "the labelling of the states in terms of the states used in the effective hamiltonian approach is not straightforward .",
    "therefore , in this work we use the approach of fitting the effective hamiltonian parameters to calculated energy levels , as in duan et al .",
    "@xcite .",

    "@xcite is used as model data to test whether the chosen effective hamiltonian operator can reproduce the `` precursor '' exciton results , and to find values for the physical parameters describing the effective hamiltonian in this case . _",

    "the crystal cscabr@xmath2:yb@xmath1 is not excitonic and does not exhibit precursor exciton behavior , so it is of interest to study the similarities and differences between the excitonic and non - excitonic cases . the motivations to determine the parameters for these systems are two - fold ; as a supplement",
    "they reinforce the _ ab initio _ calculations , allowing comparison to the expected magnitudes of electron interactions .",
    "secondly , the parameters should be comparable in other lanthanide ions , and the `` free ion '' parameters transferable between materials .",
    "therefore , the analysis will be of interest beyond the systems considered here .",

    "this is the case for a `` crystal - field '' hamiltonian applied to lanthanide ions where operators represent atomic interactions such as the coulomb and spin - orbit interactions , and also `` crystal - field '' interactions with the surroundings .",
    "the analysis of lanthanide energy levels in solids has , since the 1960 s , made use of such a `` crystal - field '' effective hamiltonian ( e.g.  @xcite ) for the @xmath28 configuration .",

    "the values of these parameters should differ by a sign between srcl@xmath0:yb@xmath1 and cscabr@xmath2:yb@xmath1 .    in order to extend the model space to include states involving @xmath11 orbitals of the yb@xmath1 ion , the @xmath4 effective hamiltonian ,",
