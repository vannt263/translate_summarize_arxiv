    "our knowledge of the galaxy  halo environment is slowing being painted by the study of the interstellar medium in both emission and absorption . understanding the distribution and kinematics of extra  planer and extended halo gas ,",

    "diffuse ionized gas ( digs ) , usually observed in and emission , has been studied in edge  on disk galaxies .",
    "@xcite found filaments in m82 that flow away from the plane of the disk .",
    "@xcite showed that digs extend out to 13 kpc above the plane of ngc 5775 .",
    "the gas is decreasing in rotational velocity with height above the plane and may have no rotation above several kpcs .    in 21cm emission",
    ", @xcite finds gas extending out to at least 5 kpc above the galaxy plane of ngc 891 that rotates 25 to 100 km s@xmath1 more slowly than the disk gas .",
    "models are consistent with a halo that is lagging behind the disk rotation .",
    "fraternali ( @xcite , 2002 , 2004 ) also found halo gas with slower rotation than the disk gas in several galaxies .",
    "this so  called `` anomalous gas '' displays a radial inward flow toward the center of the galaxy .",
    "they may be observing the infalling stage of galactic fountains .",
    "they also detect `` forbidden gas '' that moves contrary to disk rotation and does not fit well in the classical fountain picture .",
    "vertical motions and `` holes '' in the distribution have been seen in m31 ( @xcite ) and in the dwarf irregular hoii ( @xcite ) .",
    "these holes might be produced by the expansion of large bubbles around stellar associations via strong outflowing winds and/or supernovae .",
    "it is clear that the disk ",
    "halo interface is dynamically and kinematically complex .",
    "the study of halo gas in emission has several observational challenges .",
    "halo gas is intrinsically faint which limits studies to the local universe and the present epoch .",
    "furthermore , only the highest column density regions of inner halos can be studied .",
    "an additional complication is the distinction between halo and disk emission for various galaxy orientations . on the other hand ,",
    "observing halo gas in absorption allows one to probe both the inner and outer halos to much lower column densities at all redshifts .",
    "absorption selected galaxies are chosen by gas cross section only and not by _ a priori _ knowledge of galaxy morphology , orientation , and surface brightness .",
    "absorption studies primarily use the @xmath2 doublet as a tracer of halo gas .",
    "since the early 1990s , the association of absorption with normal , bright , field galaxies has been well established ( e.g. , bergeron & boiss ' e 1991 ; @xcite ) .     and",
    "are orientated such that the quasar is down .",
    "displaying the galaxies in this fashion allows one to see the variety of galaxy orientations with respect to the quasar line of sight.,width=518 ]     equivalent width .",
    " ( bottom  right ) asymmetries in galaxy morphologies normalized to impact parameter plotted against @xmath3 equivalent width.,width=508 ]",
    "we have examined the detailed connections between halo gas and galaxies using hires and uves quasar spectra to study the absorption kinematics and _ hst_/wfpc2 images of the quasar fields to measure the host galaxy properties .",
    "all galaxies in our sample are spectroscopically confirmed to have the same redshift as the absorption .    in figure  [ ggkfig : mosaic ] , we present 36 of 38 galaxies in our current sample having redshifts between 0.3 @xmath4 1 .",
    "each galaxy `` postage stamp '' is @xmath5 with the quasar oriented downward .",
    "the range of impact parameters are @xmath6 kpc .",
    "note that the galaxies exhibit a wide range of orientations with respect to the quasar line of sight .",
    "also , there are a wide variety of galaxy morphologies .",
    "some of the galaxies appear slightly perturbed and/or have bright regions .",
    "others have minor satellites or major companions .",
    "three of the absorbers are associated with double galaxies that could be in the process merging or being harassed .",
    "we modeled the morphology and orientations of the galaxies using gim2d ( ( * ? ? ? * simard 2002 ) ) .",
    "the models comprise a smooth disk and bulge component from which we quantify disk inclinations , disk position angles , disk scale lengths , bulge position angles , bulge effective radii , bulge  to  total ratios , galaxy half  light radii , and morphological asymmetries . an example model and the model residual",
    "are shown in the upper panels of figure  [ ggkfig : asym ] .",
    "we used voigt profile fitting to model the hires and vlt spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fits to the spectra provide the number of clouds in an absorption system and their associated column densities , doppler parameters , and velocities . directly from the spectra we also measured the equivalent width , velocity spread , and velocity asymmetry of the absorbing gas .    to examine halo geometry ,",
    "we tested for correlations between galaxy orientation and absorption properties for a subsample having a rest  frame equivalent width , @xmath7 , less than 1.4  .",
    "this cutoff limits our subsample to `` classical '' systems and is designed to eliminate dlas and wind driven systems ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the orientation of a galaxy is the combined projection of the galaxy s inclination , @xmath8 , and the position angle , @xmath9 .",
    "the position angle is defined as the primary angle between the galaxy major axis and the quasar line of sight .",
    "we find there are no statistically significant correlations between galaxy orientation parameters and absorption properties . in particular ,",
    "if the gas is distributed in a disk geometry then @xmath10 should correlate with @xmath7 .",
    "as shown in the bottom ",
    "left panel of figure  [ ggkfig : asym ] , the distribution is consistent with being random .",
    "the gim2d model residual image of the example galaxy , shown at the top ",
    "right panel of figure  [ ggkfig : asym ] , displays a spiral barred structure along with an extend tidal tail on one side . without modeling the galaxy",
    "these underlying features would go unnoticed . to quantify these asymmetries we used two different methods .",
    "one method computes the asymmetries on the residual image ( @xcite ) and the other is computed directly for the science image ( abraham 1994 ; 1996 ) .",
    "we find a @xmath0 correlation using the abraham method and a @xmath11 correlation using the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schade ) method between @xmath7 and galaxy morphological asymmetry normalized by the impact parameter .",
    "the correlation is shown in the bottom ",
    "right panel of figure  [ ggkfig : asym ] , where the dashed line is a maximum likelihood fit . in the near future",
    ", we will be conducting a multivariate analysis to further explore the nature of correlations between galaxy and absorption properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .     and  @xmath12  .",
    "the projected distance @xmath13 is 38.8 @xmath14 kpc .",
    " ( right ) galaxy rotation curve ( top ) as a function of slit position with the kinematics of the observed @xmath3 ( middle ) and @xmath15 absorption profiles ( bottom ) from the hires spectrum of the quasar.,width=508 ]",
    "the lack of correlations with galaxy orientation implies that gaseous halos are not necessarily disk  like or spherical or that the distribution of gas could be patchy and have a less than unity covering factor ( also see churchill 2005 _ this volume _ ) .",
    "the 3.2 @xmath16 correlation suggests that a galaxy with strong perturbations could produce a similar absorption strength at a large galactocentric distance as a galaxy with mild perturbations at a smaller galactocentric distance .",
    "it is possible that strong star formation , winds , or tidal stripping could lead to the development of both morphological perturbations in the galaxy and an increase in the halo gas cross section .",
    "galaxies that are more symmetric may not produce as significant absorption since there is a lacking or inadequate mechanism for repopulating the halo gas .",
    "this would explain why some bright galaxies close to the quasar produce very weak to no absorption ( see @xcite ) .    to help understand these results and to see if there may be sample selection effects",
    ", we will employ more advanced models ( i.e. , lagging halos , fountains , infall ) .",
    "furthermore , a full census of absorbers and non ",
    "absorbers is central to a deeper interpretation of our results .",
    "in order to further analyze the galaxy  halo kinematic connection it is necessary that we obtain spectra of the galaxies .",
    "we can then place the halo absorption features in the same velocity frame of the galaxy .",
    "the velocity field between the galaxy and the halo will tell us how they are kinematically related so that we can differentiate between competing halo models .",
    "a prime example of such a study was by @xcite , who presented the kinematic properties of halo gas for a sample of five edge  on galaxies . in figure  [ ggkfig : kinematics ] (",
    "left panel ) we present the _ hst _",
    "image of the q1038 + 064 field with an absorber at @xmath170.4415 .",
    "long slit spectroscopy was obtained to get the kinematics of the gas in the disk ( upper  right panel ) .",
    "a hires spectrum of the quasar was obtained for kinematic information of the halo gas ( lower  right panels ) .",
    "the halo gas kinematics is probed at 38.8 @xmath14 kpc away from the disk .",
    "absorption between @xmath12250 and @xmath12150 km  s@xmath1 shows halo gas kinematics similar to that in the disk .",
    "additional absorption between @xmath18 and @xmath19 km  s@xmath1 is suggestive of slower rotation with respect to the disk , similar to that mentioned by fraternali ( 2001 , 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "thus , in this galaxy probing out to distances far beyond the plane , one finds that the halo gas is aware of the the kinematics of the disk .    in four of their five cases , @xcite found disk  like halo kinematics consistent with a rotating and/or lagging halo .",
    "another study of and edge  on galaxy ( @xcite ) found absorption with velocities inconsistent with the galaxy rotation .",
    "this `` forbidden '' gas may actually be caused by superbubbles ( see @xcite ) .",
    "over all , only a half dozen galaxies have been studied in great detail by comparing the kinematics of the absorbing gas and the galaxy kinematics . however , these galaxies were all edge  on disk galaxies .",
    "we are carrying out an in depth study , similar to that mentioned above , for our sample of 38 galaxies having a wide range of morphologies and line  of  sight orientations . here , we have reported an orientation and morphology analysis , in absence of galaxy spectra .",
    "our results hint that there are some relationships between the halo and the host galaxy when looking at the distance normalized galaxy perturbations . obtaining",
    "the galaxy spectra will allow us to perform a full halo model analysis which is much need in order to understand the nature of galactic halos .",
    "we would like to acknowledge a small grant from the iau and sigma xi scientific research society .",
    "michael murphy , michael rauch , wal sargent and alice shapley all made important contributions to the new work presented herein ."
