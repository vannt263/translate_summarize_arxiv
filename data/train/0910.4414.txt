    "scintillation is among the oldest and most classic of particle detector technologies . for photons and electrons with energies below @xmath8",
    ", it appears that the light output from the scintillator is not simply proportional to the absorbed energy  @xcite .",
    "recently , this so - called scintillator non - proportionality is receiving renewed attention thanks to the utilization of scintillators at these low energies in the search for dark matter  @xcite . for ions and other particles producing heavily ionizing tracks on the one hand",
    ", this effect can be understood as a saturation effect that occurs for the light produced per unit length @xmath9 when an increase in local energy deposition @xmath3 does not lead to more light .",
    "this phenomenon is encoded in birks law  @xcite @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 are empirical constants that depend on the material and have to be determined from the data . at high energy loss @xmath3 ,",
    "the light output is no longer proportional to the energy loss , due to the term @xmath13 becoming larger than unity .",
    "eventually , @xmath9 becomes independent of @xmath3 and the total light from an event depends only on the track length  @xcite .",
    "electrons on the other hand are lightly ionizing , but for low - energy electrons , there is in fact an increase in local energy loss . as an example , figure  [ fig : dedx ] shows @xmath14 for electrons in @xmath0 , the material we shall study here . one might hence anticipate some effect from the non - proportionality in equation  [ eq : birks ] also for low - energy electrons , where @xmath3 for energies near the end of the track ( i.e. below @xmath15 ) is significantly increased .     for electrons in @xmath0 , from the ` estar ` database  @xcite .",
    "]    evidently , the most direct way to measure the response of a scintillator to electrons is to study its light output from single monoenergetic electrons , over a range of low energies .",
    "since there are no natural electron sources of this type , the compton - coincidence technique has been developed  @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "one uses a monoenergetic gamma with relatively high energy , which undergoes a compton scattering in the material under study .",
    "the scattered photon is observed in a separate detector .",
    "knowledge of the scattered photon s angle leads , via compton scattering kinematics , to a recoil electron of known energy in the material under study .",
    "this method has been employed successfully to map out the response of various scintillators to low - energy electrons ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another method to measure the electron response of a scintillator uses the monochromatic x - ray radiation from a synchrotron source .",
    "the scintillation light yield of an excitation above the characteristic k - edge of the element is measured .",
    "when the energy independent response from the cascade event that is due to the relaxation of holes in the k - shell is subtracted , it is possible to derive the response due to the k - shell photoelectron alone  @xcite .    in this note",
    ", we would like to draw attention to the possibility of a new method , which has arisen through the investigation of cryogenic scintillating detectors in the search for dark matter .",
    "a two - channel readout allows both the energy and the light yield of an event to be determined .",
    "a large sample of low energy electron events with both known energy and light yield , acquired as a background in the search for dark matter , allows a precise measurement of the scintillator response and its non - linearity .",
    "the fundamental processes of excitation of electrons in deep shells of atoms are temperature independent .",
    "indeed , it has already been shown that the non - proportionality of self - activated scintillators such as @xmath0 or bgo exhibit no temperature dependence  @xcite even thought their light yield changes significantly with temperature  @xcite .",
    "hence , measuring at millikelvin temperatures allows one to infer the scintillator non - proportionality also at room temperature .",
    "the cresst - ii experiment  @xcite is built to search for and detect a new particle species , so - called weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which could constitute the dark matter known to exist in the universe  @xcite .",
    "the expected interaction rates are less than one event per kilogram of target material , per year of observation and per kev in the energy range between @xmath15 and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "this requires a substantial reduction of backgrounds from ambient radioactivity . to this end",
    ", the cresst - ii experiment is located in the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso under an average rock overburden of @xmath17 to shield the experiment from cosmic rays , and additionally , the cryostat with the target materials is surrounded by thicknesses of @xmath18 of polyethylene , @xmath19 of lead , and @xmath20 of copper .",
    "the remaining activity is mostly due to beta emitters intrinsic to the employed target materials  @xcite . to distinguish the expected wimp - induced nuclear - recoil signal from this remaining background",
    ", an active discrimination technique is used . in cresst - ii",
    ", we use scintillating tungstates ( @xmath0 , @xmath21 ) as target materials .",
    "these crystals are shaped as cylinders with a diameter of @xmath22 and similar height , thus weighing about @xmath23 ( @xmath0 ) or @xmath24 ( @xmath21 ) each .",
    "they are cooled to temperatures of @xmath25 and operated as cryogenic calorimeters  @xcite : non - thermal phonons generated in a particle interaction are collected by a superconducting phase - transition thermometer  @xcite which is stabilized in its transition to the superconducting state by means of an additional heater structure on the thermometer  @xcite . by this configuration ,",
    "the resulting change of resistance following a particle interaction can be read out with a squid - based readout scheme  @xcite and is used for a calorimetric measurement of the interaction energy .",
    "an additional cryogenic detector  @xcite in the vicinity of the crystal is used to detect the scintillation light , typically about @xmath26 of the total energy for electrons  @xcite .",
    "the light detector response is calibrated and linearized independently of the scintillation light using externally created pulses injected into a heater structure on the thermometer  @xcite .",
    "hence , each particle interaction results in two parameters : the energy @xmath27 of the interaction as measured directly with the calorimeter , and the light yield @xmath28 , which is defined as the ratio of detected light @xmath29 over the energy @xmath27 of the interaction",
    ". we measure @xmath28 in units of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 ( kev electron - equivalent ) is defined via a @xmath32 calibration source such that @xmath33 gamma rays produce photoelectrons with a light yield of @xmath34 .",
    "relevant in the search for dark matter is the possibility to discriminate electron or gamma - induced events from nuclear recoils based on a strongly reduced light yield of the latter . for example , recoiling alphas have @xmath35 of the electron light yield .",
    "due to coherence effects , dark matter induced events are expected to mainly cause recoiling tungsten nuclei , which show less than @xmath36 of the electron light yield  @xcite .",
    "the effects discussed in this note are more subtle and concern slight variations within the population of electron and gamma - induced events .",
    "the data presented here was taken over a period of about one month while no calibration source was present .",
    "the accumulated data is shown in the light yield - energy plane @xmath37 in figure  [ fig : daisyrun27e ] for interaction energies @xmath27 up to @xmath38 .",
    "the events are mainly from a continuous electron background due to an internal contamination of the crystal with @xmath39 and other beta emitters  @xcite . in addition",
    ", a few gamma lines of both internal and external origins are superimposed ; we will come back to these in section  [ sec : gammaquenching ] .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : daisyrun27e ] is the mean of the light yield in each @xmath40 energy bin , which clearly decreases with decreasing energy .",
    "this scintillator non - proportionality has previously been measured for @xmath0 with small crystals under external gamma irradiation  @xcite at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures .",
    "measurements with other tungstates at room temperature also show the same effect  @xcite .",
    "( detector daisy / run 27 ) .",
    "number of entries per bin are according to the grey scale on the right .",
    "the white data points mark the mean of the light yield in each @xmath40 energy bin together with the error bars of the mean and the width of the energy bin ; the scintillator non - proportionality is clearly visible .",
    "the solid ( blue ) line is a fit according to the model described in the text . ]",
    "this scintillator non - proportionality can be explained simply by the stopping power per unit path length @xmath14 for electrons in @xmath0 , together with birks law ( equation  [ eq : birks ] ) .",
    "integrating birks law allows a calculation of the light yield @xmath37 : @xmath41    for @xmath14 , we use the data from the ` estar ` database  @xcite shown in figure  [ fig : dedx ] . with @xmath9 from equation  [ eq : birks ]",
    ", we can perform a fit of equation  [ eq : model ] to our data , which yields the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this fit is also shown in figure  [ fig : daisyrun27e ] . when the errors stated by the ` estar ` database are taken into account ,",
    "the variation of the fit is within the thickness of the line in figure  [ fig : daisyrun27e ] , even when allowing for a @xmath42 variation for energies @xmath43 .",
    "the model can be seen to describe the observed scintillator non - proportionality well .    from the fit",
    "we obtain the birks constants as @xmath44 and @xmath4 for electrons in our @xmath0 crystal . since @xmath11 describes a linear dependence between @xmath9 and @xmath3 , as appropriate for higher energies , the value @xmath45 was to be expected by construction of the @xmath31 unit .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 characterizes at what @xmath3 the light yield @xmath28 begins to saturate , and @xmath46 may be thought of as a quantity @xmath47 .",
    "dividing by the density of the @xmath0 crystal of @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 .",
    "this is consistent with the range @xmath50 which was estimated in  @xcite based on a different method .",
    "the absorption of a gamma is typically a complicated process , where an electron is ejected from its shell , leaving a vacancy .",
    "the electron gives rise to scintillation , but has less energy than the incoming gamma .",
    "the binding energy of the electron will be released in the form of an auger electron ( mainly for light elements ) or x - rays ( for heavy elements ) , which can in turn eject other electrons , leading to an electron cascade for each gamma traversing the scintillator . in this way",
    ", the final energy transfer to the material following a gamma interaction takes place through a number of low - energy electrons , further enhancing the role of the last few kev of electron tracks  @xcite ( compare figure  [ fig : dedx ] ) .",
    "hence , in the presence of scintillator non - proportionality , we can expect a reduced light yield for low - energy gamma events with respect to electron events of the same energy , since the initial energy of the gamma is distributed over many electrons . given a parametrization of the scintillator non - proportionality for electrons ,",
    "the light yield for gammas has been calculated in the framework of this model for a few materials  @xcite , although a calculation for @xmath0 is not known to us .",
    "it thus appears possible that a non - linear gamma response of the light yield can be understood via the saturation effect of equation  [ eq : birks ] .",
    "here , we demonstrate the presence of a reduced light yield for gamma events in @xmath0 crystals .",
    "it is already visible in figure  [ fig : daisyrun27e ] that the @xmath51 line has a somewhat reduced light yield with respect to the continuous electron background . in addition , at @xmath52 where the @xmath31 unit is normalized to unity with gamma events from a @xmath32 calibration , the mean of the light yield of the observed electron background is @xmath53 , pointing to a reduced light yield of the gamma events in the calibration .",
    "a quantitative analysis needs to disentangle the light yield of gamma events from that of the electron background . to this end ,",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrumdaisyrun27 ] shows the spectrum of the data shown in figure  [ fig : daisyrun27e ] , in which three gamma lines can be identified .",
    "one at @xmath51 is due to an external contamination with @xmath54 .",
    "two more lines at @xmath55 and @xmath56 are due to tungsten activated by cosmic radiation .",
    "the remaining spectrum is rather flat and dominated by the beta spectrum of @xmath39  @xcite .    .",
    "the flat background is due to the beta spectrum of @xmath39 .",
    "the three observed lines are labeled according to their origin : one is due to an external contamination with @xmath54 , the other two are due to cosmogenic activation of the tungsten . ]",
    "we proceed as follows : for each of the observed gamma lines at energy @xmath57 , a gaussian is fitted to the light yield distribution of _ off - peak _ events , which are taken from the intervals @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "a second population is taken _ on - peak _ , from @xmath60 $ ] , which corresponds to a @xmath61 interval around the line , given the energy resolution of the calorimeter at these energies .",
    "the sum of two gaussians is fitted to the on - peak distribution : one gaussian is completely fixed to have the same mean light yield @xmath62 and the same width @xmath63 as the off - peak gaussian , and its amplitude @xmath11 is scaled to the smaller on - peak energy bin width .",
    "for the second gaussian all parameters are left free .",
    "figure  [ fig : quenchingpb2e ] shows the off- and on - peak distributions and the fits for the @xmath54 line at @xmath51 . clearly , the additional gamma events from the @xmath54 line show a reduced light yield compared to electrons of the same energy of only @xmath64 of the electron yield .",
    "resulting fit parameters are @xmath65 for the light yield ( in agreement with our model which gives @xmath66 ) , and @xmath67 .",
    "lower histogram : fit of the sum of two gaussians ( full line ) to the @xmath54 on - peak distribution .",
    "one gaussian ( dashed ) has all parameters taken from the off - peak distribution and represents the electron events .",
    "all parameters of the second gaussian ( dotted ) which accounts for the gamma events are left free , and the fit finds @xmath68 and @xmath69 . ]    since @xmath51 gammas are absorbed within the first millimeter in @xmath0 , an alternative explanation of the reduced gamma light yield could be based on the following argument : the crystals are cut in cylindrical shape to have the largest crystals possible in the search for dark matter .",
    "hence , events happening close to the mantle surface could show a reduced light yield due to geometrical light trapping in the crystal , following total internal reflections on the mantle surface , in which case the @xmath54 line could show a reduced light yield simply due to light trapping . however , this is not the case , as we demonstrate considering sources of photons which are uniformly distributed throughout the crystal .",
    "exposition to cosmic radiation of the crystals or the raw materials from which they are grown leads to an activation of the tungsten .",
    "we observe products from the reactions @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the resulting isotopes will be distributed homogeneously throughout the whole crystal , independently of whether the activation takes place before or after crystal growth .",
    "the isotope @xmath72 decays with a half - life of @xmath73 in an electron capture process into @xmath74  @xcite . in most cases , this results in a vacancy in the k - shell , which is quickly filled , eventually leading to a cascade of low - energy x - rays . in our calorimetric measurement",
    "we observe the full binding energy of a hafnium k - shell electron , namely @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding off- and on - peak distributions together with the gaussian fits are shown in figure  [ fig : quenchingta2e ] .",
    "the resulting gamma light yield is @xmath75 of the electron light yield , just as in the case of @xmath54 events .",
    "thus , light trapping can be excluded as explanation for the reduced gamma light yield .",
    "peak ( upper histogram , only electron events ) gives @xmath76 for the light yield ( in agreement with our model which gives @xmath77 ) and @xmath78 .",
    "fitting the sum of two gaussians to the on - peak distribution ( lower histogram ) , one gaussian representing electron events ( dashed ) , the other gamma events ( dotted ) , gives @xmath79 , and @xmath80 for the light yield of gamma events . ]    a consistent observation can be made with a second line from cosmic activation : the isotope @xmath81 decays with a half - life of @xmath82 in an electron capture process into @xmath83 under emission of an additional @xmath84 gamma  @xcite .",
    "we observe the line at an energy corresponding to the binding energy of a tantalum k - shell electron ( @xmath85 ) plus the energy of the gamma , namely @xmath56 .",
    "the light yield of this line is derived as above , and again the light yield of gammas is found to be reduced to @xmath86 of the light yield for electron events of the same energy .",
    "we have presented measurements of scintillator non - proportionality for low - energy electrons in @xmath0 .",
    "the crystal under investigation is cooled to mk temperatures , and the non - thermal phonon signal is measured with a superconducting phase - transition thermometer for a calorimetric measurement of the interaction energy . the light yield is measured with a separate cryogenic light detector .",
    "the observed scintillator non - proportionality for low - energy electrons is well described by a simple model based on birks law and the stopping power @xmath3 of electrons in @xmath0 .",
    "gamma events show a light yield that is reduced to @xmath87 of the light yield of electron events with the same energy .",
    "this is understood within the same model , where gamma events in a scintillator cause a cascade of low - energy electrons , which in turn produce the scintillation light .",
    "our findings help to identify nuclear recoil signals in experiments that use @xmath0 to search for dark matter .",
