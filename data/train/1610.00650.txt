    "the ability to manipulate the magnetic and ferroelectric properties of multiferroic bifeo@xmath0 ( bfo ) by dopants opens up promising opportunities for fabricating new multiferroic materials in the field of information storage technology .",
    "noticeably , the spiral modulated spin structure ( smss ) of bfo possesses an incommensurate long - wavelength period of 62 nm @xcite due to which the macroscopic magnetization gets cancelled . as a result , the linear magnetoelectric effect is no longer observed @xcite .",
    "moreover , the preparation of undoped bfo is challenging due to the formation of different impurity phases @xcite .",
    "thus the use of undoped bulk bfo in functional applications gets rather limited due to these hindrances .",

    "again , at b site , the partial substitution of fe by ti was performed as the substitution of ti@xmath6 was reported to decrease the leakage current significantly and induce a remanent magnetization in bifeo@xmath0 @xcite . moreover , the bond enthalpies of gd - o ( @xmath7 kj / mol ) and ti - o ( @xmath8 kj / mol ) bonds are , respectively , stronger than those of bi - o ( @xmath9 kj / mol ) and fe - o ( @xmath10 kj / mol ) bond enthalpies @xcite .",

    ", we found that the major phases namely , bfo , gd doped bfo and gd - ti co - doped bfo are of rhombohedral _",
    "r3c _ type crystal structure .",
    "however , the substitution of bi by gd indeed destabilizes the _ r3c _ phase of bifeo@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "next , for the gd doped bfo , we observed the presence of the same impurity phases .",
    "interestingly , when we performed gd and ti co - substitution , the unintended phase is suppressed significantly as the wt% of bi@xmath19fe@xmath20o@xmath21 reduces to @xmath26 in 10% gd and ti co - doped bi@xmath1gd@xmath2fe@xmath1ti@xmath2o@xmath0 .",

    "[ fig02 ] the o 1s core xps spectra of the corresponding samples are shown .",
    "the plots display an asymmetric peak very close to 529 ev along with an additional peak at slightly higher binding energy ( hbe ) .",
    "the asymmetric curves of the samples have been gaussian fitted by two symmetrical peaks .",
    "the lower binding energy ( lbe ) peak around 529.3 ev corresponds to the o 1s core spectrum , while the hbe peak is related to the oxygen vacancy in the samples @xcite .",

    "so , clearly the ratio decreases with gd - ti co - substitution as compared to bfo and gd doped bfo indicating reduction in oxygen vacancies .",
    "the effect of this reduced vacancy is further explored in section c where we investigate the leakage current density of the samples .      for magnetic characterization ,",

    "due to the substitution of gd and co - substitution of gd and ti in place of bi and fe in bifeo@xmath0 , respectively , the unsaturated magnetization behavior of the samples remains unaltered , however , the center of the hysteresis loops was many folds wider compared to that of undoped bfo .",

    "the substitution of gd in place of bi in bifeo@xmath0 i.e in sample x = 0.00 ( fig .",

    "the leakage current density was also found to decrease upon the substitution of gd in place of bi in bifeo@xmath0 compared to that of undoped bfo .",
    "the rounded shape p - e loops for undoped and 10% gd doped bfo with large p@xmath33 indicate that the electrical leakage is severe in these materials .",

    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) and ( b - d ) ) also demonstrates that the breakdown voltage is significantly increased due to substitution of gd and co - substitution of gd and ti . by comparing p - e loops of fig .",

    "@xcite , it is obvious that the remanent polarization and dielectric constant follow exactly the same trend .",
    "this similarity is expected as the polarization is related to electric field through the dielectric constant .",
    "in this investigation , field dependent magnetization measurements were carried out in undoped , gd doped and gd - ti co - doped bifeo@xmath0 multiferroic ceramics . for 10% gd and ti co -",

    "this multiferroic ceramic material exhibited eb effect notably at rt which indicates the coexistence of their afm and fm orderings .",
    "we also obtained a transition from negative to positive eb with decreasing h@xmath44 in this material , that again at rt , which could lead to various exciting applications .",
    "the zfc and fc magnetization curves of undoped bulk bifeo@xmath0 ceramics show an anomaly near 264 k which was found to disappear upon the substitution of gd and also co - substitution of gd and ti in bifeo@xmath0 . due to the substitution of rare - earth gd and transition metal ti in place of bi and fe in bifeo@xmath0 ,",
    "respectively , the leakage current density was reduced .",
    "this reduction in leakage current densities might be due to reduction of oxygen vacancy related defects which were analysed from the xps spectrum .",
    "the value of the leakage current density was minimum for 10% gd and ti co - doped bi@xmath1gd@xmath2fe@xmath1ti@xmath2o@xmath0 bulk material and therefore an improved ferroelectric behavior of this composition was observed .",
    "the improved multiferroic properties obtained by 10% gd and ti co - doping in bifeo@xmath0 is promising for novel multifunctional device applications .",
    "we may further conclude that an appropriate choice of co - doping elements and fine composition adjustment are keys to optimize the multiferroic properties of bifeo@xmath0 ceramics .",
