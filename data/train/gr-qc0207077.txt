    "spacetimes with non - trivial topology have been of interest at least since the classic works of flamm @xcite , einstein and rosen @xcite and weyl @xcite .",
    "the einstein - rosen bridge , for example , connected two sheets and was to represent an elementary particle .",
    "later , in studies of quantum gravity , the wormhole was used as a model for the spacetime `` foam '' @xcite - @xcite which manifests itself at energies near the planck scale .",
    "the past decade has produced many interesting studies of lorentzian as well as euclidean wormholes ( much of this work is summarized in the book by visser @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this resurgence was mainly due to the meticulous study by morris and thorne @xcite of static , spherically symmetric wormholes and their traversability properties .",
    "such studies of non - trivial topologies have widespread applicability in studies such as chronology protection @xcite , topology change @xcite , as well as horizon and singularity structure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for example , it may be possible that semiclassical effects in high curvature regions may cause wormhole formation and , via this mechanism , avoid a singularity .",
    "this would have much relevance to the information loss problem .",
    "wormhole structures have also been considered in the field of cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the wormhole may not only be limited to the domain of the theorist .",
    "some very interesting studies have been performed regarding possible astrophysical signatures of such objects @xcite - @xcite .",
    "theories of unification ( for example , superstring theories ) tend to require extra spatial dimensions to be consistent .",
    "the gravitational sector of these theories usually reproduce higher dimensional general relativity at energies below the planck scale , as is studied here . lacking a fully consistent theory of quantum gravity ,",
    "it is of interest to ask what the physical requirements of systems are at the classical level . in the semi - classical regime",
    ", our study of the stress - energy tensor will dictate what properties the expectation value , @xmath1 , must possess in order to support a higher dimensional non - trivial topology .",
    "many gravitational studies have been performed taking into account the possibility of extra dimensions ( for example @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "often , however , the extra dimensions considered are non - compact and all dimensions are considered equivalent . here",
    "we are concerned with the more realistic case of kaluza - klein type extra dimensions .",
    "theories to explain high - energy phenomena even allow , or require , the possibility of large extra spacetime dimensions @xcite-@xcite . in some of these theories",
    ", the standard model fields may freely propagate in the higher dimensions when their energies are above a relatively low ( roughly electro - weak ) scale @xcite such as would be found in the early ( yet sub - planckian ) universe or in high - energy astrophysical systems or colliders .",
    "we are therefore not necessarily interested solely in wormholes traversable by large objects as is often studied in the literature .",
    "finally , higher dimensional relativity is often studied to discover if any interesting features are revealed in dimensions other than four .",
    "this avenue has proved fruitful in the case of lower dimensional black holes @xcite as well as higher dimensional stars @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to include the possibility of higher dimensions in studies of wormholes .",
    "the above motivations indicate that it is instructive to study wormhole systems of a general class .",
    "we attempt to make the models here physically reasonable and therefore work with the matter field ( the stress - energy tensor ) whenever possible . in the next section",
    "we discuss a gauge ( coordinate system ) which we briefly introduced in @xcite .",
    "this gauge offers advantages when studying the near - throat region over the usual coordinates employed in the study of wormholes ( such as the proper - radius and curvature gauges ) . in this gauge",
    ", we calculate the _ general _ einstein tensor , orthonormal riemann components and conservation law for time - dependent wormholes with an arbitrary number of compact dimensions .",
    "these equations may also be utilized for non - wormhole systems .",
    "it is a well known fact that , with the four dimensional static wormhole , one must violate the weak energy condition ( wec ) at least in some small region near ( but not necessarily at ) the throat @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that , if one drops the staticity requirement , the wec violation may be avoided at least for certain intervals of time @xcite - @xcite for scale factors without a boundary . the null energy condition ( nec )",
    "has also been discussed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in section [ subsec : quasistat ]",
    "we construct a general class of wormhole geometries which are static in the four non - compact dimensions but may possess time dependent compact extra dimensions .",
    "that is , we consider higher dimensional versions of the well studied four dimensional static systems .",
    "these are physically relevant if one wishes to consider wormholes in a universe where the expansion of the non - compact dimensions is negligible , as in studies of stars .",
    "however , unlike the four dimensional case , it is shown that the wec at the throat either places restrictions on the wormhole s size or can not be satisfied , depending on the model .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the presence a stellar - vacuum boundary and the extra dimensions .",
    "energy condition analysis is limited to the near - throat region since , away from the throat , it may be possible to patch the wormhole to energy condition respecting matter .",
    "we examine the energy conditions for the non - diagonal stress - energy tensor as it turns out that for @xmath2 , one may demand staticity in the non - compact dimensions and still possess a non - zero radial energy flux .",
    "we concentrate on the weak energy condition since , of the well known energy conditions , it is the easiest to satisfy and it may be argued that the energy conditions are too restrictive a criterion in any case @xcite . that is , their violation seems to show up in acceptable _ classical _ as well as quantum field theories and therefore do not imply that energy condition violating systems are necessarily unphysical .    to make the solutions as physically relevant as possible",
    ", we patch the `` star '' supporting the non - trivial topology to the vacuum .",
    "doing so requires us to solve the vacuum field equations .",
    "( we define the classical vacuum as one which satisfies @xmath3 , the @xmath4-dimensional newton s constant , and @xmath5 . here , greek indices take on values @xmath6 whereas lower - case latin indices take on values @xmath7 .",
    "indices referring solely to the compact dimensions will be denoted by capital latin letters . ] ) .",
    "it turns out that , with compact extra dimensions , a unique spherically symmetric vacuum _ does not exist _ and we discuss each allowable vacuum in some detail .",
    "some vacua are even space _ and _ time dependent and therefore there is _ no _ birkhoff s theorem with compact dimensions .",
    "admittedly , some vacua may be ruled out by experiment .",
    "these `` bounded '' objects may possess greater astrophysical relevance than those of infinite extent and shed light on how the presence of a second boundary affects the interior structure .",
    "we also admit non - zero cosmological constant as will be required for the vacuum product manifold .",
    "this is not only relevant from a cosmological perspective @xcite , @xcite but yields a much richer vacuum structure as will be discussed in section [ subsec : vacstruct ] below .",
    "we concentrate on making the solutions event horizon and singularity free as there is much interest in the literature in the possibility of a wormhole being traversable .",
    "( even if one is considering high energy wormholes such as those manifest in the early universe , traversability may be important for particle transport which may lead to the large scale homogeneity of the universe we observe today . )",
    "we study here the spherical geometry which is qualitatively represented by figure [ fig:1 ] which displays a constant time slice with all but one angle suppressed . the wormhole possesses a throat of radius @xmath8 and may connect two regions representing different universes or else connect two distant parts of the same universe .",
    "the matter boundary is located at @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 indicate the upper sheet and lower sheet respectively ) where the interior solution joins the vacuum .",
    "an in - depth analysis of such a `` stellar system '' which is four dimensional and explicitly static may be found in @xcite .",

    "there is a throat at @xmath8 and stellar boundaries at @xmath13 where the system must smoothly join the vacuum . ]    in the curvature coordinates , labeled in figure [ fig:1 ] , one usually employs the following line element : @xmath14 where we have included the possibility of extra dimensions via @xmath15 thus yielding a warped product manifold of @xmath16 .",
    "the line element on a unit @xmath17 sphere is : @xmath18 .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ]    this chart , though useful , is not ideal for analysis of the throat .",
    "first , there is a coordinate singularity at @xmath8 .",
    "also , an explicit junction occurs here in these coordinates which must be addressed via the introduction of an `` upper '' chart and a `` lower '' chart ( the @xmath11 and @xmath12 indicated above ) .",
    "therefore , one must carefully consider junction conditions at the throat to possess an acceptable patching from the upper to lower chart .    alternately , another common chart is the proper radius chart whose line element is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ( signed ) proper radial coordinate : @xmath21 here the lower sheet in figure [ fig:1 ] corresponds to the @xmath12 sign in ( [ eq : proprad ] ) and the upper sheet corresponds to the @xmath11 , the throat located at @xmath22 .",
    "although continuous , the profile curve is not manifest in this chart .",
    "it is desirable in wormhole physics to retain the profile curve in calculations since one can prescribe properties of the wormhole via manipulation of the profile curve .",
    "we choose to employ another , `` global '' , chart which we briefly introduced in @xcite .",
    "the relation between this chart and the curvature coordinates of ( [ eq : curvline ] ) is illustrated in figure [ fig:2 ] .    .",
    "the function @xmath23 represents the profile curve in the curvature coordinates . *",
    "b ) * by rotating this curve , we invert the function @xmath24 thus generating the profile curve @xmath25 in a coordinate system which is continuous across the throat . ]    to generate this coordinate system , one starts with the standard curvature coordinates .",
    "these consist of the upper and lower charts with profile curves given by @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 ( refer to figure [ fig:2]a ) .",
    "rotating the @xmath30-plane about the @xmath31-axis of figure [ fig:2]a by @xmath32 , we can study the profile curve as parameterized by the coordinate @xmath33 .",
    "that is , the profile curve given by @xmath34 ( see figure [ fig:2]b ) .",
    "the coordinate @xmath33 belongs to an interval containing @xmath35 , the throat of the wormhole . in this parameterization",
    ", the function @xmath36 is assumed to be continuous at @xmath35 since an acceptable wormhole requires @xmath37 .",
    "of course , the function @xmath36 is not completely arbitrary and must possess the correct properties to describe a wormhole .",
    "these will be discussed below .",
    "( also , the profile function @xmath36 must be at least of class @xmath38 to generate an acceptable metric . )",
    "we concentrate in this paper on the region @xmath39 as the physical results are the same for @xmath29 and calculations can easily be modified to include @xmath29 .    the surface of revolution generated by rotating the curve in figure [ fig:2]b about the @xmath33-axis ( the direction of @xmath40 ) possesses the induced metric : @xmath41}\\,(dx)^{2}+ p(x)^{2}\\,(d\\phi)^{2}. \\label{eq : twomet}\\ ] ]      any time dependent wormhole must possess a metric of the form ( [ eq : twomet ] ) on the @xmath42-sub - manifold .",

    "we consider below only the cases for @xmath165 since it is easy to check that any energy condition violation is more severe for @xmath169 .    to satisfy the boundary condition ( [ eq : syngcond1 ] )",
    ", we write : @xmath213 with @xmath214 or @xmath215 and @xmath216 differentiable but otherwise arbitrary which helps in eliminating singularities . also , from the equation ( [ eq : quasistat2 ] ) we find that @xmath217^{-1}\\frac{1}{p(x_{b})^{2}}. \\label{eq : tdeptxxbound}\\ ] ] here we have used ( [ eq : tdepgx ] ) and the fact that @xmath218 as required for continuity of the metric at the boundary . from the solution of the vacuum equations , the time - dependent terms in @xmath171 give a constant , related to the cosmological constant , at @xmath151 ( or equivalently when @xmath219 ) , this yields the coefficient in the @xmath167 term in ( [ eq : tdeptxxbound ] ) .",
    "therefore , if the profile curve and its first derivative match their corresponding vacuum functions at the boundary , @xmath171 will vanish there , satisfying the junction condition ( [ eq : syngcond2 ] ) . at this point ,",

    "positivity of @xmath222 has already been established and so we next concentrate on negativity of @xmath171 .    near the throat",

    "we next turn our attention to the energy condition ( [ eq : econd2b ] ) . unlike the previous condition",
    ", this condition is generated by positive pressure instead of tension .",
    "it is therefore more realistic from an astrophysical point of view .",
    "it is simple to check that the wec at the throat _ can not _ be satisfied for either ( [ eq : econd2b ] ) or ( [ eq : econd2c ] ) . to see this recall that both these conditions require @xmath225 and @xmath226",

    "again , unlike the four dimensional and static cases , a wec respecting throat is _ forbidden_. even at points away from the throat , the time dependent terms in @xmath191 conspire to yield a negative constant . therefore",
    ", since all energy conditions imply the positivity of some expression which possesses the linear combination @xmath191 ( a necessary but not sufficient condition ) , the time dependence tends to impede rather than favour the wec .",

    "studies have shown that if one introduces time dependence in the four dimensional case , the wec may be respected for arbitrarily long periods of time @xcite - @xcite .",

    "the above analysis differs in that the matter field does not possess infinite spatial extent .",
    "that is , the global picture is constructed via the introduction of the matter - vacuum boundary . when the models are patched to the vacuum the time dependence of the extra dimensions is now fixed by the vacuum and can not be chosen arbitrarily .",

    "serious restrictions are placed on the wormhole due to the presence of the vacuum - matter boundary and extra dimensions . if one wishes to respect the wec at the throat in the static case , the extra dimensions place a restriction on the radial size of the wormhole throat .",
    "its radius in the uncompact dimension must be of the order of the size of the compact dimension .",
    "the only exception is for @xmath0 . for the quasi - static case , the wec _ can not _ be satisfied at the throat even though seemingly arbitrary time - dependent terms are present in the solution .",
