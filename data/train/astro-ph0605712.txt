    "in the energy release process in solar flares , magnetic reconnection is generally considered to play a key role .",
    "the reconnection rate is an important quantity , because it puts critical restrictions on the reconnection model .",
    "it is defined as @xmath5 in non - dimensional form , where @xmath6 is the velocity of the reconnection inflow and @xmath7 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "it gives the normalized value of the reconnected flux per unit time . in spite of its importance ,",
    "what determines the reconnection rate in flares is still a question . in the steady reconnection model of @xcite and @xcite , the reconnection rate is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the magnetic reynolds number defined with the alfvn velocity and @xmath10 is the magnetic diffusivity . in the solar corona ,",
    "if the resistivity is attributed to the coulomb collision @xcite , the typical value of @xmath11 is @xmath12 , which means @xmath13 and estimated timescale of flare is about one year .",
    "it is , of course , too slow to explain flares whose timescale is about @xmath14 seconds . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite pointed out that the previous model lacks the effect of wave and suggested his model with @xmath15 .",
    "the special feature of this model is that @xmath16 has weak dependence on @xmath11 . in this model @xmath17 when @xmath18 and the estimated timescale is consistent with observed value ( see also @xcite ) .    the sweet - parker model and the petschek model shown above are steady reconnection models .",
    "the physics of nonsteady reconnection is not established clearly . discussed the plasmoid - induced - reconnection model .",
    "since flares are nonsteady phenomena , they suggested possibility that the reconnection rate in a flare is determined by the nonsteady and dynamic processes , such as plasmoid ejections .",
    "another uncertainty in the model of the reconnection mechanism is uncertainty of the magnetic reynolds number @xmath11 .",
    "it was suggested that finite levels of mhd turbulence can lead to increase of the magnetic diffusivity , i.e. , decrease of the effective magnetic reynolds number ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    though there are some observational case studies about the reconnection rate , statistical studies are very few so far .",
    "@xcite examined the spatial and temporal scales of reconnection events in the solar atmosphere described in the literature and found that the reconnection rate is on the order of 0.001 - 0.1 .",
    "@xcite analyzed the temperature structure of 1992 february 21 lde flare in detail and found that the reconnection rate is 0.07 .",
    "he assumed isothermal switch - off shock and used the condition of the shock to derive the reconnection rate .",
    "the flare on 1992 january 13 was analyzed by @xcite and the reconnection rate in this flare was estimated at 0.06 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied 1993 november 11 flare and 1992 october 5 flare , respectively .",
    "they found the value of 0.003 - 0.2 in preflare and impulsive phase , and 0.0002 - 0.0003 in gradual phase .",
    "@xcite analyzed the decay phase of an lde flare on 1997 may 12 and estimated the reconnection rate at 0.001 - 0.01 using the energy release rate and the reconnected magnetic flux . using the same method as the previous one , @xcite analyzed 7 flares and 2 giant arcades and found that the reconnection rate is 0.001 - 0.1 .",
    "moreover , analyzing the impulsive phase of three two - ribbon flares , @xcite obtained the value of 0.015 - 0.071 .",
    "recently , direct measurements of the reconnection inflow were reported .",
    "@xcite found an evidence of reconnection inflow and derived the reconnection rate as 0.001 - 0.03 . by the same method , @xcite reported 6 inflow events and found the reconnection rate is 0.001 - 0.07 .",
    "@xcite studied an eruptive limb event occurred on 2003 november 18 and reported the reconnection rate is in the range from 0.01 to 0.23 .",

    ", we report a statistical study of flares that occurred in the year of 2000 observed with _ yohkoh_/sxt . we determine several physical quantities of each flare and try to estimate the reconnection rate in solar flares .",

    "the amount of energy released during a flare @xmath19 can be explained by the magnetic energy stored in the solar atmosphere ; @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the characteristic size of the flare and @xmath22 is the characteristic magnetic flux density in the corona . since the released magnetic energy balances the energy flowing into the reconnection region",
    ", we can describe the energy release rate as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the inflow velocity of the plasma .",
    "therefore , the time required for the energy inflow to supply the flare energy is estimated as @xmath25 and this should be the timescale of the flare . using this timescale , we can estimate the inflow velocity @xmath24 as @xmath26 to evaluate the reconnection rate in non - dimensional form @xmath27 , we must estimate the alfvn velocity in the inflow region @xmath28 . hence ,",
    "if we measure the coronal density @xmath29 , the spatial scale of the flare @xmath30 , the magnetic flux density in the corona @xmath22 , and the timescale of flares @xmath31 , we can calculate inflow velocity @xmath24 , alfvn velocity @xmath32 , and reconnection rate @xmath16 .      in this subsection",
    "we describe how to determine the parameters required for derivation of the inflow velocity @xmath24 and the alfvn velocity @xmath32 .",
    "to estimate the inflow velocity @xmath24 by using equation ( [ eq : vin ] ) , we need the spatial and temporal scales of each flare : @xmath30 and @xmath31 . first , the flare size @xmath30 is determined by soft x - ray images taken by the soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ; @xcite ) onboard the _ yohkoh _ satellite @xcite with the beryllium ( be ) filter .",
    "we define @xmath30 as the square root of the area where the intensity is more than 10% of the maximum value in each frame and it is measured at the time when _ goes _ x - ray intensity attains its maximum value in each event .",
    "the error of @xmath30 is considered as the difference in definition of the size ; the minimum size is defined by the area where the intensity is more than 30% of the maximum value in each frame and the maximum size is defined by the area where the intensity is more than 3% of the maximum value .",
    "the timescale of a flare @xmath33 is defined as the period from the onset to the peak of _ goes _ x - ray flux .",
    "since we use one - min average of _ goes _ x - ray flux data , the error of this timescale is considered as one minute . in equations ( [ eq : eflare ] ) and ( [ eq : dedt ] ) , the spatial scale of the flare @xmath30 should be the length of the current sheet .",
    "although we can not measure it or estimate the ratio of the current sheet to the global size accurately , we can consider the length of the current sheet is the same order as the size of system since the flare size @xmath30 is measured in the impulsive phase .    to estimate the alfvn velocity in the inflow region @xmath32",
    ", we need coronal density @xmath29 and coronal magnetic flux density @xmath22 . owing to difficulty in measuring the coronal density @xmath29 , we assume it @xmath34 that is the typical value in the active region .",
    "the coronal magnetic flux density @xmath22 is also difficult to measure directly .",
    "therefore , we try to evaluate it in two ways . in the first method ( method 1 )",
    ", we use the photospheric magnetograms from the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ; @xcite ) onboard _ the solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ;",
    "we define the representative magnetic flux density for each flare as follows : first , using soft x - ray images taken by sxt with the be filter , we determine the area in which the intensity is larger than a threshold value .",
    "second , we measure the magnetic flux in the area and obtain the average of unsigned magnetic flux density . changing this threshold value from 10% to 50% of the maximum soft x - ray intensity of each image ,",
    "magnetic flux densities are obtained as a function of the threshold value of the soft x - ray intensity .",
    "finally , we define representative magnetic flux density @xmath35 as the midpoint of the maximum and the minimum of the obtained flux density in this range and consider the extent from the maximum to the minimum as the error range of @xmath35 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bmaxmin ] we show the result of the _ goes _",
    "m3.9 class flare on january 18 as an example .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : bmaxmin ] illustrates the photospheric magnetogram of the flare region .",
    "white and black indicate positive and negative polarities in the magnetogram .",
    "the overlaid contours correspond to 10 , 30 , and 50% of the maximum soft x - ray intensity .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : bmaxmin ] shows photospheric magnetic flux density as a function of the threshold value of the soft x - ray intensity .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the maximum and minimum flux density and the solid line corresponds to the midpoint value , which is defined as the representative photospheric flux density of this event .    in order to obtain the coronal magnetic flux density , we assume @xmath36 and @xmath37 among all flares",
    ". the validity of this assumption will be discussed in ",
    "[ sec : alphadis ] .",
    "the second method ( method 2 ) to obtain the coronal flux density is as follows .",
    "if all the magnetic energy stored in the corona before the reconnection process turns into the thermal energy in the reconnected loop , we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the plasma pressure in the flare loop and @xmath40 is the magnetic flux density in the corona . to distinguish this magnetic flux density from that derived by method 1",
    ", we use the subscript `` eq '' .",
    "the value of @xmath39 is estimated from the color temperature @xmath41 and the emission measure @xmath42 calculated from the _ goes _ x - ray data @xcite , that is , @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 is the number density in the flare loop , and @xmath46 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "since the _ goes _ x - ray flux data have no spatial resolution , we use the flare size measured in the sxt image as the size @xmath30 in equation ( [ eq : nemv ] ) .",
    "hence , we can estimate @xmath47 and assume @xmath48 .",
    "the error of this flux density @xmath47 results from the error in deriving temperature and emission measure from the _ goes _ x - ray data . on the basis of the description in @xcite , estimated uncertainty in the derived temperature depends on the temperature and is calculated at 13% around 10 mk .",
    "we calculate this uncertainty as a function of temperature and then obtain the propagated error of @xmath47 .",
    "as we describe in the previous subsection , we use sxt images , mdi magnetograms , and _ goes _ x - ray flux data .",
    "we survey flares that occurred in 2000 under the following criteria : ( 1 ) _ goes _ class of the flare is above c6.0 , ( 2 ) the flare site is included in the field of view of the partial - frame sxt image with the be filter taken at the peak of the _ goes _ soft x - ray flux , and ( 3 ) the distance from the disk center to the flare region is within 800 arcsecs to avoid the line - of - sight effect in estimation of the magnetic flux density . from the flare list obtained by _",
    "goes _ data , 482 flares meet the above criterion ( 1 ) and 77 of those flares satisfy all the criteria .",
    "using the method described in the previous section , we have analyzed 77 flares occurred in the year of 2000 .",
    "first , we examine dependence of physical parameters of these flares on _ goes _ class . in figure",
    "[ fig : cl_para ] we plot the parameters of flares as a function of _ goes _ class .",

    "we find from these plots : ( 1 ) there is weak correlation between the timescale @xmath31 and the _ goes _ peak flux ( panel a ) .",

    "( 2 ) the characteristic size of flares @xmath30 shows a larger scatter when the _ goes _ peak flux is smaller ( panel b ) .",
    "@xcite reported the relation between the _ goes _ peak flux and the loop length of flares in their figure [ fig : clma ] . comparing our results with theirs ,",
    "the value of the size is in the same range , although clear correlation between these parameters can not be found out in their results .",
    "( 3 ) there is a threshold value in the magnetic flux density ( @xmath35 and @xmath47 ) that increases as the _ goes _ peak flux increases ( panels c and d ) . for example , the x - class flares occurred only when @xmath49 was larger than @xmath50 100 gauss .",
    "second , we examine the relationship between the physical parameters of flares .",
    "figure [ fig : m1_tl ] shows the spatial scale @xmath30 plotted against the timescale @xmath31 and tells that the spatial scale @xmath30 tends to be larger with increasing timescale .",

    "[ sec : howto ] , we estimate the coronal magnetic flux density in two ways . in figures [ fig : cl_para]c and [ fig : cl_para]d , although the flux density obtained by method 1 ( figure [ fig : cl_para]c ) appears more broadly scattered than that obtained by method 2 ( figure [ fig : cl_para]d ) , the values of flux density show the similar distribution . moreover , the magnetic flux density obtained by these two methods has a similar distribution as a function of @xmath31 ( figure [ fig : tb ] ) .",
    "two panels of figure [ fig : clma ] show that the values of the reconnection rate obtained by methods 1 and 2 are the same range and display the same dependence on the _ goes _ class .",
    "hence , we conclude that the results by these two methods are consistent with each other .",
    "we must examine whether the assumption that the ratio of coronal flux density to photospheric flux density @xmath55 equals @xmath56 is appropriate one . in figure",
    "[ fig : bphbeq ] , we compare the photospheric flux density @xmath35 obtained by method 1 with the equipartitional flux density @xmath47 obtained by method 2 .",

    "this figure shows the ratios are distributed around 0.3 , and if we consider @xmath47 as the coronal flux density , our assumption @xmath58 is not inappropriate .",
    "@xcite estimated coronal flux density from data of photospheric flux density described in the scientific literature .",
    "he calculated typical magnetic flux density as a function of height as photospheric magnetogram forms the base .",

    ", we obtain the coronal field of 38 g by equation ( [ eq : magdere ] ) ; we can also calculate the photospheric flux density of his model at 95 g by taking @xmath62 in equation ( [ eq : magdere ] ) .",
    "therefore the ratio of the coronal flux density to the photospheric flux density is roughly estimated at 0.4 .",
    "this formula probably underestimates the magnetic flux density , because the photospheric flux density analyzed in our paper is in the range from 100 g to 700 g. hence , we also did a calculation of the coronal potential field for some particular events for more investigations .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : potential ] shows average potential magnetic field strength of x2.3 flare occurred on 2000 november 24 .",
    "this flux density is extrapolated by using the software package magpack2 @xcite and its strength is determined and averaged in the central portion of the flare . in this calculation , the coronal flux density at the height of @xmath63 that corresponds to the flare size of this event is @xmath64 .",
    "as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : potential ] , the photospheric field strength is @xmath65 at @xmath62 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath54 in equation ( [ eq : bbratio ] ) should be calculated by the ratio of the coronal flux density to the line - of - sight strength of the photospheric field",

    "we calculate some other events and obtain the ratio @xmath54 in the range of 0.2 - 0.6 .    considering these estimates of the ratio , the assumption @xmath70 is probably plausible . as a result , on the basis of the result described in  [ sec : result ] , we find the reconnection rate @xmath16 is @xmath3 for our analyzed events .      in this section , we compare our results with the previous studies to evaluate our results . using inflow pattern in extreme ultraviolet images ,",
    "the inflow velocity @xmath24 was measured around @xmath71 by @xcite , while @xcite obtained @xmath72 - @xmath73 @xmath74 in six events .",
    "including other indirect measurements , the inflow velocity is in the same range as our results ( figure [ fig : m1_tl ] ) .",
    "moreover , we analyze one of @xcite s events on 1999 may 27 using our method described in  [ sec : howto ] .",
    "we estimate the inflow velocity at @xmath75 @xmath74 , while they reported the inflow velocity of this event is @xmath76 - @xmath77 @xmath74 or @xmath78 - @xmath79 @xmath74 .",
    "the former is obtained by the method based on @xcite , while the latter is obtained by the estimation based on @xcite . in either case , the velocity obtained by our method is less than that obtained by their method .",
    "next , we compare our results with those of @xcite , since some of our analyzed events are also examined by them . in our statistical study",
    "we use relatively simple methods to study a large number of events , while they dealt with three events in detail in their case study .",
    "table [ tab : compare ] summarizes parameters of the flares obtained in this work and in @xcite , mainly referring to their table 1 .",
    "we calculate some parameters based on this table as follows .",
    "@xcite measured the width @xmath80 , the length @xmath81 , and the height @xmath82 of the flare arcade separately . to compare with our measurement of @xmath30",
    ", we calculate the flare size @xmath30 is defined as the cubic root of the product of @xmath80,@xmath81 , and @xmath82 given in the paper .",
    "the averaged energy release rate @xmath83 is defined as the thermal energy in the flare loop divided by the temporal scale , @xmath84 this value is calculated from the peak value of @xmath85 in @xcite s figures 6 , 8 , and 10 together with our _ goes _",
    "timescale @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , we define the energy release rate @xmath86 as equation ( [ eq : dedt ] ) for our study and as @xmath87 in @xcite for their study , both of which correspond to the poynting flux into the diffusion region .",
    "furthermore it should be noted here that the _ goes _ c - class event in table [ tab : compare ] is not one of our analyzed events in this statistical study due to lack of the non - saturated sxt image with the be filter at the flare peak . therefore using the last non - saturated image with the",
    "be filter taken at three minutes before the peak , we calculate the parameters in this table for only comparison .    comparing our result with @xcite",
    ", we find that in our study the inflow velocity @xmath24 is systematically smaller .",
    "since we calculate @xmath24 as @xmath88 , @xmath24 obtained in our study is an average value in the impulsive phase of a flare . on the other hand , @xcite estimated @xmath24 using the peak value of the energy release rate in the impulsive phase of the flares",
    ". therefore our small inflow velocity @xmath24 perhaps reflects nonsteadiness of the reconnection rate in the reconnection process .",
    "moreover , owing to our larger coronal magnetic flux density @xmath22 , the coronal alfvn velocity @xmath32 of our result is systematically larger than those of their result .",
    "consequently , this larger @xmath32 and smaller @xmath24 make the reconnection rate @xmath16 smaller than a factor of 2 - 10 .",
    "nevertheless , considering energy budget of each flare , we note that our result is not inconsistent ; the energy release rate @xmath86 is comparable with the averaged energy release rate @xmath83 during the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "here we discuss the possible implication to the models from the reconnection rate obtained in this work . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , different models show not only different values of the reconnection rate but also different dependence of the reconnection rate on the magnetic reynolds number @xmath89 .",
    "therefore we examine this dependence . the reconnection rate @xmath16 is plotted against the magnetic reynolds number @xmath11 in figure [ fig : rmma ] .",
    "the reconnection rate and the reynolds number obtained by method 1 is shown in the left panel of the figure and those obtained by method 2 is shown in the right panel . in the left panel ,",
    "the dash - dotted line indicates the least - squares fitting of the data , which yields @xmath90 , while in the right panel there is no clear dependence since the magnetic reynolds number is distributed within one order of magnitude . to see the figure clearly",
    ", the error bars of the magnetic reynolds number are omitted in the right panel , though the error is one order of magnitude at most .",
    "the dotted lines in both panels indicate the dependence of the reconnection rate on the magnetic reynolds number that is predicted by the petschek model and the dashed lines indicate the sweet - parker - type dependence @xmath91 . in calculation of the magnetic diffusivity @xmath10 in @xmath11",
    ", we assume the resistivity is attributed to the coulomb collision @xcite and the plasma temperature is @xmath92 .    in the process of estimating the reconnection rate @xmath16 and the magnetic reynolds number @xmath11 shown in figure [ fig : rmma ]",
    ", we have following assumptions : ( 1 ) the coronal density @xmath29 is @xmath93 , ( 2 ) the ratio of coronal flux density to photospheric flux density @xmath55 equals @xmath56 , and ( 3 ) the plasma temperature is @xmath92 . if the coronal density @xmath29 and/or the ratio @xmath54 deviate from the assumed value , the values of the alfvn velocity and the magnetic reynolds number are affected .",
    "however these values will only shift by some factors on the whole .",
    "therefore the distribution shown in figure [ fig : rmma ] , i.e. , the power index of the dependence of the reconnection rate @xmath16 on the magnetic reynolds number @xmath11 will not be greatly affected by assumptions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "moreover , we can consider the factor to shift to be less than one order of magnitude , because the coronal density @xmath29 is thought to be within at most one order of magnitude from the typical value and the ratio @xmath54 is estimated in the range of 0.2 - 0.6 as mentioned in  [ sec : alphadis ] .",
    "furthermore , in analyzing by method 2 , we calculate the plasma temperature from _ goes _ x - ray data and find that the observed temperature of plasma is distributed within less than one order of magnitude around @xmath92 . hence assumption ( 3 ) is thought to have little effect on our results .    from the comparison of ours with the previous results mentioned in  [ sec : comparison ] ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the error of the obtained reconnection rate shown in our figures is probably a little underestimated .",
    "besides the assumptions mentioned in the previous paragraph , other uncertainties , such as the uncertainties in the measurements of the size @xmath30 , the timescale @xmath31 , the temperature @xmath41 and the emission measure @xmath42 , will affect our result . even after considering all these effects , the value of @xmath16 in figure [ fig : rmma ] is found within one order of magnitude from the theoretical value of the petschek model , while dependence of the reconnection rate on the magnetic reynolds number tends to be stronger than that in the petschek model .",
    "this result suggests two possibilities : one is the occurrence of the petschek - type reconnection in the flares and the other is the sweet - parker model with the magnetic diffusivity @xmath10 enlarged by some diffusion processes , such as the mhd turbulence . owing to the uncertainties",
    ", we can not immediately rule out the possibility of either the petschek model or the generalized sweet - parker model from our result .",
    "we expect to discriminate between these two interpretations by the observations of _ solar - b_. if the sweet - parker reconnection with this enhanced resistivity occurs in a flare , the thickness of the diffusion region is estimated to be 100 km , when the length of the diffusion region is approximately the size of flare @xmath94 and the reconnection rate is @xmath95 . because the size of diffusion region is less than the limit of resolution , the structure of turbulence is expected to be observed as a single - pixel line - broadening with _ solar - b_. on the other hand , if the petschek - type reconnection occurs , the slow shock structure is expected to be observed .",
    "we analyze the data of flares occurred in the year of 2000 and measure the temporal scale @xmath96 , the size @xmath30 , and the magnetic field @xmath97 of each flare .",
    "first , we examine the dependence of these parameters on the _ goes _ class and find that the sizes of flares tend to be distributed more broadly as the _ goes _ class becomes weaker , and there is a threshold value in both photospheric and coronal magnetic flux density that increases as the _ goes _ peak flux increases .",
    "second , we examine the relationship between those parameters .",
    "there is weak correlation between temporal and spatial scales of flares , while there is little correlation between temporal scale and magnetic flux density .",
    "finally , we try to estimate the reconnection rate in each flare .",
