    "if , as is widely believed , large - scale structures form in the universe by means of the hierarchical assembly of dark haloes , one would expect the most massive galaxies to be the youngest , as they would be formed from mergers over time .",
    "however , the brightest galaxies , elliptical in morphology , typically found at the centres of rich clusters , appear to be dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "galaxies with current star formation , on the other hand , have been shown to be disc - dominated , mostly occurring in regions of lower density .",
    "such relations between the properties of galaxies and their environment were first pointed out using morphology to characterise galaxies @xcite , but , in later studies , other photometric properties such as colour ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been shown to correlate with environment as well .",
    "in addition to understanding the formation of dark matter haloes , the study of galaxy formation and evolution clearly requires detailed knowledge of the various physical processes that affect baryons , such as mergers , tidal interactions , stripping , cooling and feedback .",
    "observations of the relevant galaxy features and their dependence on environment are very important in our comprehension of the relative importance of these processes , a subject that remains an issue of considerable disagreement ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the availability of large - scale spectroscopic surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( henceforth sdss ) , has resulted in structural parameters of galaxies being largely replaced by spectroscopic properties , in the exploration of the impact of the global and local environment on the nature of a galaxy ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * among others ) . compared to broad - band colours , spectroscopic parameters such as integrated star formation rate ( sfr ) , specific star formation rate ( ssfr or sfr / m@xmath4 ) , h@xmath3 equivalent width ( ew ) and the 4000   break ( d@xmath54000 ) , in principle , give more detailed information about the underlying stellar populations in galaxies , but one can not expect these parameters to behave in the same way with environment as the global photometric properties .    various factors , including the presence of dust , and the well - known degeneracy between the effect of age and metallicity , prevent a straight - forward correspondence between the star formation history of a galaxy and its broad - band colours ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . as a result ,",
    "the use of broad - band colours and of spectroscopic indicators might yield different classification for a galaxy on an evolutionary sequence . in order to compare observational studies where",
    "different photometric or spectroscopic parameters have been used to define sub - samples , one would like to ask , for instance , for what fraction of galaxies the correspondence between morphology , colour and star formation properties fails to hold , and whether such galaxies could be identified from other observable properties .",
    "are these unusual galaxies more likely to occur in certain kinds of environment ?    in order to address some of these questions , we choose , for this study , galaxies in and around rich clusters in the low redshift universe .",
    "galaxy clusters are well suited for such an analysis , since from their cores to their infall regions , they provide a wide range of environments , with varying space density and velocity dispersion .",
    "the aim of this work is to examine how well galaxy properties obtained from two mutually independent techniques , namely photometry and spectroscopy , correlate with each other , and to explore the possible causes of discrepancy .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the next section we define the galaxy sample , and the galaxy properties to be used here .",
    "we plot the specific star formation rate of these galaxies against colour , and identify the four classes of galaxies that we will deal with : red sequence , red star - forming , blue star - forming and blue passive . in  [ results ] , we examine the various galaxy properties , derived from photometry and spectra , that we use in this analysis .",
    "the insight these properties provide into the nature of blue passive and red star - forming galaxies are discussed in ",
    "[ discussion ] , and the main conclusions are summarised in  [ conclusions ] . throughout this work",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath6 & @xmath7 and @xmath8 km  s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 for calculating distances and absolute magnitudes .",
    "we note that in the redshift range chosen for this work ( @xmath10 ) , the results are insensitive to the choice of cosmology .",
    "we use the spectroscopic galaxy data provided by the sdss dr@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the sdss consists of an imaging survey of @xmath12 steradians , mainly in the northern sky , in five passbands @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the imaging is done in drift - scan mode , and the data is processed using the photometric pipeline photo @xcite specially written for sdss .",
    "the spectra are obtained using two fibre - fed double spectrographs , covering a wavelength range of 3800 - 9200  .",
    "the resolution @xmath15 varies between 1850 and 2200 .",
    "we use the galaxy magnitudes and the corresponding galactic extinction values in the @xmath16 & @xmath17 sdss passbands from the new york university value added galaxy catalogue ( nyu - vagc ; * ? ? ?",
    "we @xmath18-correct these magnitudes to @xmath19 ( median redshift of the sample , @xcite ) .",
    "we only consider galaxies with absolute magnitude m@xmath20 ( this corresponds to the apparent magnitude limit for the sdss spectroscopic catalogue at the median redshift of our sample , @xmath19 ) .",
    "we take all abell clusters @xcite , in the redshift range 0.02@xmath210.12 , that lie sufficiently away from the survey boundary so as to be sampled out to @xmath22  mpc from the cluster centre .",
    "we constrain our sample to moderately rich clusters by considering only those that have at least @xmath23 galaxies ( brighter than the magnitude limit , m@xmath24 ) with sdss spectra within @xmath25  mpc of the cluster centre .",
    "this leaves us with a sample of @xmath26 clusters .",
    "we aim to study the effect of present and recent star formation on the observed properties of galaxies over a wide range of environment , and so we seek to examine galaxies not just in the cores of the clusters , but also on the outskirts .",
    "detailed studies of the velocity structure in the infall regions of clusters show that the turnaround radius of clusters extends out to almost twice the virial radius @xcite , so we chose to examine radial trends of the properties of galaxies out to a projected radius of @xmath27  mpc of each cluster centre . within this radius ,",
    "we pick galaxies within the following velocity ranges about the mean redshift of the cluster : @xmath28 adopting these differential velocity slices helps in reducing interlopers , in the absence of a rigorous procedure for assigning cluster membership , and hence is well suited for a statistical study like this .",
    "note that other popular methods , such as the 3-@xmath29 velocity dispersion cut , are prone to include galaxies at large projected radius from the cluster centre , and our velocity cuts are consistent with the caustics in velocity space used by the cairns survey @xcite .",
    "we find the velocity dispersion ( @xmath29 ) of each cluster , from the identified members , using the bi - weight statistics ( rostat , * ? ? ?",
    "the characteristic size of the cluster ( the radius at which the mean interior over - density in a sphere of radius @xmath17 is @xmath30 times the critical density of the universe ) is calculated using the relation given by @xcite : @xmath31 .",
    "our final sample comprises of @xmath26 abell clusters ( @xmath2 ) in which there are 6,010 galaxies within @xmath32 of the cluster centres .",
    "in this work , we use various quantities derived from the sdss optical spectra by @xcite  ( b04 henceforth ) , based on sdss dr@xmath11 catalogue . from this and related work @xcite ,",
    "we use specific spectral indices ( emission corrected h@xmath3 equivalent width and [ neiii ] contamination corrected d@xmath54000 ) .",
    "two of the galaxy parameters we use to begin with , namely the specific star formation rate ( ssfr , or sfr / m@xmath4 ) and stellar mass ( m@xmath4 ) , are derived using the sdss galaxy spectra by b04 and @xcite respectively .",
    "b04 construct a grid of @xmath33 spectral synthesis models @xcite over four relevant parameters spanning a range in metallicity ( @xmath34 ) of @xmath35 , ionization parameter ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37 , total dust attenuation ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39 and dust - to - metal - ratio ( @xmath40 ) @xmath41 .",
    "the attenuation by dust is treated using a physically motivated model of @xcite , which provides a consistent model for ultra - violet ( uv ) to infra - red ( ir ) emission .",
    "b04 compare the modelled line - ratios for each model in their grid directly with those in the observed spectrum , and , for each galaxy , construct a log - likelihood function for each point on the model grid , summed over all lines observed in the spectrum of that galaxy .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that since they study relative line fluxes only , their analysis is insensitive to stellar ages , star formation history and the relative attenuation by dust in the molecular gas clouds and the interstellar medium .",
    "b04 derive their values for star formation rate ( sfr ) and specific star formation rate ( sfr / m@xmath4 ) using a bayesian technique , involving the likelihood functions mentioned above , using the entire spectrum of each galaxy ( it is worth noting that the spectrum comes from a fibre of diameter 3@xmath42 ) .",
    "it is shown that their work yield better estimates of the sfr and sfr / m@xmath4 than any single spectroscopic sfr indicator , such as equivalent width ( ew ) of the h@xmath43 or o  ii lines , which are used extensively in the literature .",
    "furthermore , the combination of several line indices enables one to separate the galaxies with a significant agn component from those with emission entirely due to star formation .",
    "the derived parameters ( sfr and sfr / m@xmath4 ) are then corrected for aperture biases using their photometric colours . out of the three statistical estimates ( mean , median and mode ) for the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of sfr and sfr",
    "/ m@xmath4 derived for each galaxy , we use the median of the distribution in this work for each quantity , since it is independent of binning .",
    "star - forming galaxies can be separated from the agn - dominated ones on the basis of the so - called bpt diagram @xcite , namely a plot of the line ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath44 against h@xmath45/[nii ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : bpt ] , for galaxies with all four emission lines .",
    "b04 divide all galaxies into four classes ( star forming , agn , composite and unclassified ) using the bpt diagram . for",
    "those galaxies whose spectra do not show all the above mentioned emission lines , ( called ` unclassified ' galaxies ) , and those that are classified as agn - dominated , b04 adopt an indirect method for estimating the sfrs .",
    "they use the relationship between the d@xmath464000 and sfr derived for the high s / n ( @xmath47 ) star - forming galaxies ( sfr@xmath48 ) to estimate the sfr of the agns and low s / n galaxies ( sfr@xmath49 ; see section 4.1 of b04 for details ) . using the entire spectrum",
    "also makes it possible to obtain an independent estimate of stellar mass m@xmath4 , which further constraints the estimated sfr / m@xmath4 , making it a more reliable parameter for evaluating star formation properties of galaxies , compared to other luminosity based parameters employed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "@xcite adopt similar methodology as b04 for estimating the stellar mass m@xmath4 .",
    "their models are characterised by star - to - light ratio , dust attenuation and fraction of mass formed in a major burst of star formation ( the burst mass fraction ) .",
    "they then compute the total mass in stars by multiplying the dust - corrected and @xmath18-corrected @xmath14-band luminosity of the galaxy , by the estimated @xmath14-band mass - to - light ratio of the best - fitting model , found using the bayesian technique described above .",
    "several authors have shown that the sfr of a galaxy scales with its stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the reason for this correlation is yet unclear , and beyond the scope of this work , we employ the specific star formation rate sfr / m@xmath4 as the more reliable measure of the star formation activity of galaxies .",
    "the values of sfr ( and sfr / m@xmath4 ) derived for the galaxies with emission lines ,   all but those categorised as ` unclassified ' , are reliable ( see fig .  14 ; b04 ) , because the classification requires s / n@xmath50 in all the @xmath11 lines involved in the bpt diagram ( , h@xmath43 , h@xmath51 , [ oiii ] and [ nii ] ) .",
    "but for spectra of galaxies without emission lines , or of those that are unclassified ( most of which are passive ) , the uncertainties are relatively higher .",
    "we chose not to select galaxies based on the confidence interval values derived from the pdf of the sfr and sfr / m@xmath4 parameters of individual galaxies , because excluding galaxies with higher uncertainties in sfr / m@xmath4 ( or sfr ) distribution would preferentially exclude a significant number of passive galaxies and thus bias our samples .",
    "galaxy properties measurable from photometry or spectra , such as colour , sfr or ssfr ( sfr / m@xmath4 ) have been extensively used in studies of their dependence on the environment of the galaxy @xcite , or on other variables representing mass , such as the stellar mass of the galaxy @xcite or its circular velocity @xcite .    in this work",

    "here we stack all the cluster galaxies together , and fit a red sequence to galaxies which has a slope of @xmath53 with an absolute deviation of @xmath54 .",
    "since this slope is negligible , we adopt a null slope red sequence at @xmath55 .",
    "we note that using the actual red sequence fit does not change our results at all .",

    "the blue passive galaxies clearly show late - type morphologies ( @xmath61 ; * ? ? ?",

    "their findings are consistent with the idea that the star formation in passive late - type galaxies ceased a few gyr ago . hence , the blue passive galaxies can be considered to be the progenitors of their red counterparts , in which star formation has been recently shut - off : these galaxies will eventually acquire redder colours and early - type morphologies , over a period that depends upon their environment @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently identified , characterized and studied the evolution of galaxies which , though morphologically classified as e / s0s , lie on the blue sequence in the colour - stellar mass space , and suggest that these systems almost always have a bluer outer disk , and that they are a population in transition , potentially evolving on to the red sequence , or have ( re)formed a disk and are about to fall back in the class of late - types .",
    "even more interesting are red galaxies with signs of active star formation in their fibre spectra .",
    "we find that 53.4% of the 539 galaxies in this class have significant emission lines on the basis of which their ssfr has been evaluated .",
    "these red star - forming galaxies are made up of at least two kinds of galaxies ( chosen from simple limits in colour and ssfr ) .",
    "one kind appears to be very similar in photometric properties to the red sequence galaxies but with spectroscopically derived properties consistent with their late - type counterparts , while the other class has both photometric _ and _ spectroscopic properties similar to the red sequence galaxies , yet has a high ssfr .",
    "the origin of the latter class is not clear .",
    "it is likely that these galaxies are currently experiencing a starburst , which has started very recently ( @xmath620.5 gyr ) .",
    "stellar populations resulting from such a starburst would be detected in spectral indices such as h@xmath45 ew ( leading to high values of sfr / m@xmath4 ) , but will not dominate the d@xmath54000 and the h@xmath3 ew for another @xmath570.51  gyr .",
    "the former sub - population is most likely to be bright cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , with nuclear star - formation linked with the agn ( see * ? ? ?",

    "in the following we turn our attention to this sub - population .",
    "the hypothesis that agn and star formation activity in the core of a galaxy may be linked is supported by the fact that @xmath5730% of the red star - forming galaxies with emission lines are classified as agn on the bpt diagram .",
    "the fact that 50% of the emission - line red sequence galaxies ( defined according to fig .",
    "[ ssf - gr ] ) are also classified as agn does not contradict this scenario because either ( i ) the red sequence agn galaxies in general have high stellar mass , and so can have low ssfr even though they have significantly high sfr , or ( ii ) they do not have enough cold gas to form stars , because of the presence of an active nuclei .    a significant fraction of giant ellipticals show evidence of ongoing star formation or signs of recent ( @xmath632  gyr ) star formation in their cores , particularly in environments where the likelihood of recent mergers is high ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a sample of bcgs in 48 x - ray luminous clusters , @xcite find that 25% of the bcgs have colour profiles @xmath64 that turn bluer toward the centre .",
    "our radial distribution of galaxies in this category ( fig .",
    "[ dist ] ) , compared to the distribution of blue star - forming galaxies , is consistent with this ( see  [ sec : radial ] ) .",
    "elsewhere , @xcite analyse an extensive dataset , covering uv to ir seds for galaxies in the abell 901/902 cluster pair , to show that @xmath5740% of the star - forming galaxies residing in intermediate to high density environments have optically red colours .",
    "they show that these galaxies are not starbursts , and have sfrs similar to or lower than that of their blue counterparts . whether the occurrence of blue cores in red sequence galaxies is linked to their nuclear activity , and whether the nuclear activity itself is modulated by the immediate environment of a galaxy ( such as the presence of close neighbours ) ,",
    "remains a debatable issue .",
    "we intend to return to this in future work involving a more detailed study of nuclear starbursts ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "the scenario discussed in ( ii ) above complements the blue passive galaxy population discussed in  [ bpsec] massive galaxies without much cold gas could be formed in dry major mergers of the passive blue progenitors , while high speed encounters amongst them in moderately dense environments , such as in the infall regions of clusters @xcite , could lead to excessive loss of cold gas , leaving the galaxy to evolve passively thereafter .    in a spatially resolved spectroscopic study of 48 early - type galaxies ,",
    "the sauron team @xcite simultaneously observed the co(1 - 0 ) and co(2 - 1 ) lines with 28% detection rate ( 12/43 ) @xcite . in this sample",
    "they find that the co - rich galaxies show strongest evidence of star formation in the central ( @xmath574x4 arcsec@xmath65 ) regions and also tend to have higher h@xmath44 and lower fe5015 and mg@xmath66 indices .",
    "the results presented in this work also support various studies based on the uv data obtained by the galaxy evolution explorer ( _ galex _ ) which suggests that a significant fraction ( @xmath5715% ) of bright ( @xmath67 ) early - type galaxies show signature of recent ( @xmath621 gyr old ) star formation ( @xcite ; also see @xcite ) .      since star formation in a galaxy",
    "is often associated with the presence of dust , one would naively expect these red star - forming galaxies to be the dusty starburst galaxies widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , we find that only @xmath68% of the galaxies in this class show presence of any optical extinction ( figs .",
    "[ dust ] & [ o - i - r ] ) .",
    "so why are the rest of the galaxies red ?    to address this question , we explore two other factors affecting galaxy colours , namely age and metallicity .",
    "we use stellar metallicities and mean luminosity - weighted stellar ages from the work of @xcite , which are estimated from 150,000 monte carlo simulations of a full range of physically plausible star formation histories .",
    "these models are logarithmically distributed in a metallicity range of 0.22.5 @xmath69 . in a given model ,",
    "all stars have the same metallicity , interpreted as the ` luminosity - weighted stellar metallicity ' . for each model in the library , @xcite measure the strength of the d@xmath54000 , and the h@xmath44 , h@xmath70+h@xmath71 , [ mg@xmath72fe ] and [ mgfe]@xmath73 spectral indices in the same way as they are measured in the sdss spectrum of a galaxy . by comparing the strengths of these indices in the observed spectrum to the model spectra in their library ,",
    "the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of several physical parameters , such as age and metallicity of a galaxy , are constructed .",
    "we use the @xmath17-band luminosity weighted ages ( hereafter referred to as ` mean galaxy ages ' ) and stellar metallicities derived from these pdfs . for galaxies in our cluster sample , we find that the red star - forming galaxies are systematically older than their blue counterparts by 5 - 7  gyr . in fig .",
    "[ rs ] , we compare the distributions of stellar metallicities of the red and blue star - forming galaxies .",
    "we confirm that the two distributions are statistically different by using the kolmogorov - smirnoff ( k - s ) statistics , which finds the probability of two datasets being drawn from the same parent population .",
    "the k - s test finds the maximum difference between the cumulative frequency distributions of the red and blue star - forming galaxies to be @xmath74 , with the probability of the null hypothesis being satisfied to be essentially zero .",
    "further support for the presence of excessive metals in the red star - forming galaxies is provided by a comparison between the gas - phase metallicities ( log[o / h]@xmath7512 ) estimated by @xcite , who have compiled a sample of @xmath5753,000 star - forming galaxies from the entire sdss dr4 ( selected to have h@xmath43 , h@xmath44 & [ nii ] emission lines at @xmath76 detection ) .",

    "though the two samples compared here have widely different numbers of galaxies , our conclusion is consistent with that of @xcite , who show that for a sample of 43,690 galaxies , selected from the sdss dr4 , the gas - phase metallicities of galaxies with high ssfr are lower by 0.2 dex , compared to those with low ssfr at fixed stellar mass .",
    "the fact that their metallicities are estimated by a comparable but independent method ( see @xcite for details ) , further strengthens our result .    around 35% of all red star - forming galaxies",

    "the fact that @xmath8260% of our red galaxies have log m@xmath4 in the range 10.6 - 10.9 m@xmath81 supports the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the red star - forming galaxies obtain their red colours from the residual older generations of stars .",

    "we divide a sample of @xmath836,000 galaxies found in or near rich abell clusters ( z@xmath790.12 ) in the sdss spectroscopic catalogue , into four populations , defined by placing simple limits in @xmath92 colour ( derived from photometry ) and specific star formation rate ( derived from the detailed modelling of optical spectra ) .",
    "while most blue galaxies have evidence of star formation , and red galaxies do not , this identifies two significant populations of blue passive galaxies and red star - forming galaxies .",
    "we trace the spectroscopic and photometric properties of galaxies in these four sub - samples in detail , using data available from sdss dr4 .",
    "the main results of our analysis can be summarised as follows :    * for the blue passive galaxies , the dust content and values for the d@xmath54000 are similar to those of the blue star - forming galaxies , indicating similar metal content , mean ages and internal extinction . *",
    "since the blue passive galaxies have a broad distribution of h@xmath3 ew , along with late - type morphologies , they appear to be similar to the passive blue spirals studied by other authors .",
    "our results support the hypothesis that these galaxies could be the progenitors of the red sequence galaxies in which star formation has been recently shut off due to the impact of local / global environment . *",
    "an intriguing find of this study is that only @xmath5750% of the red star - forming galaxies have significant values of extinction , indicative of the presence of dust .",
    "* by comparing the stellar metallicities , gas - phase metallicities and mean ages of the red and blue star - forming galaxies , we find statistically significant evidence in support of the fact that , for at least half of the red star - forming galaxies , the red colours result from a relatively metal - rich stellar population .",
    "our argument remains valid even if the criterion for classification as star - forming based on ssfr is changed within reasonable limits ( 15 - 50 percentile , instead of the 25-percentile used in this work ) .",
    "* a significant ( @xmath5715% ) fraction of the red star - forming galaxies have blue cores , indicating recent star formation which might be linked to the agn activity in these galaxies . *",
    "the population of passive red sequence galaxies increase toward the cluster centre , closely followed by the red star - forming galaxies , except that the latter does not rise steeply in the cluster core . *",
    "the blue star - forming galaxies are distributed uniformly at 1 - 3r@xmath91 from the cluster centre , but decline steeply within r@xmath91 .",
    "the blue passive galaxies on the other hand show a constant distribution , except for a small increase around 2r@xmath91 . *",
    "galaxy evolution studies which base their sample selection criterion only on broadband colours to test butcher - oemler like effects , may be significantly affected by the presence of ` complex ' galaxy populations such as the red star - forming and blue passive galaxies discussed here .",
