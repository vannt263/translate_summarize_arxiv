    "it is known that the special relativity theory is the physical theory of measurement in inertial frame of reference proposed by albert einstein in 1905 , after substantial contributions of hendrik lorentz and henri poincar ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this theory gave us @xmath0 which led to the atomic bomb and unlocked the secret of the stars .",
    "at that time the expansion nature of the universe was not discovered yet , and this information was not included in the formulation of the special relativity theory . in 1915 albert einstein proposed the general relativity theory , in which the expansion of the universe was not the main objective .",
    "he proposed that gravity , as well as motion , can affect the intervals of time and of space .",
    "the general relativity theory gave us : the space warps , the big bang , and black holes .",
    "the metric @xmath1 of the space - time proposed in general relativity does not allow the incorporation of the expansion in the the lorentz transformation ( since the increasing function of time @xmath2 , that characterizes the expansion nature of the space , omits the linearity in the considered transformations ) , and then it does not permit to perceive if the laws of nature proposed by the special relativity are affected or not together with the universe expansion .",
    "many essays have been achieved in this purpose in the last hundred years , which can be found easily in the literature .",
    "the only cited papers in this article are those who have a clear and direct relationship with this kind of approach . given that the expansion was studied in the general relativity theory , it seems counter nature to discuss universe expansion in the special relativity theory .",
    "however , discussing the effect of the expansion on the laws of nature in the special relativity is different , and might entail some disturbing new concepts which will challenge deeply our deep - rooted understanding of the relativistic laws of nature . in this paper we will explore the incorporation of a special expansion in the special relativity theory that preserves the notion of inertial frame , and we will rewrite and interpret the relativistic laws of nature in the light of this special expansion .      in this article",
    "we introduce a practical quantification of the space expansion in our universe using a metric with a numerical product that quantifies the expansion of the space step by step ( we will call it universe expansion ) , and maintains the notion of inertial frame on it . in the second section we rewrite the lorentz transformation equations using the new metric to obtain a family of lorentz transformation equations @xmath3 , where each transformation @xmath4 represents the lorentz transformation equations at the step n of the space expansion .",
    "this family of transformation leads to a decreasing limiting velocity of moving bodies from one step to another , and then the physical laws are affected by the universe expansion , followed by conclusions derived concerning energy , masses , and momentum in an expanding space . in section three ,",
    "the composition of velocity is derived using @xmath4-lorentz transformation equations to discuss the invariance of the new limiting velocities of matter .",
    "the rest mass of photon is then discussed in section forth and new quantum formalism is introduced .",
    "we conclude this section by discussing an inelastic collision in which we find that the conversion of the rest - energy into kinetic energy is affected by the universe expansion as well as the fact that the total liberated energy by fission of atoms is increasing naturally together with the universe expansion .",
    "we conclude by some comments related to the notion of time and proper time .      from the rate at which galaxies are receding from each other in our universe",
    ", it can be deduced that all galaxies must have been very close to each other at the same time in the past .",
    "meanwhile galaxies are receding from each other what really happen to the physical laws , are they affected by the process of expansion or not ? in the purpose to investigate the status of the physical laws together with the universe expansion we propose the following quantification of the universe movement : suppose that we can quantify the whole universe movement , from the beginning of the universe expansion where matter was together until present time with current picture of matter distribution .",
    "suppose that we can subdivide the whole process of expansion from the beginning until present time into n steps , in which we approximate the rate of change of the distance between any two separated events from one step to another together with the universe expansion as follow :    @xmath5    @xmath6 : _ if the distance between two events at the step n is equal to @xmath7 , and at the step ( n+1 ) is equal to @xmath8 then @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a sequence such that @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath14 , and @xmath15 converges . _    for this quantification",
    "the step 0 represents the beginning of the expansion of our universe ( once @xmath16 ) and the space - time is defined as the set of events together with the notion of squared interval @xmath17 defined between any two events .",
    "an event @xmath18 in a reference frame @xmath19 is fixed by four coordinates @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the spatial coordinates of the point in space when the event in question occurs at the step 0 , and where @xmath23 fixes the instant when this event occurs .",
    "another event @xmath25 will be described within the same reference frame by four different coordinates @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the points in space where these two events occur are separated by the distance @xmath30 given by @xmath31 .",
    "the moments in time when these two events occur are separated at the step 0 by a time interval given by @xmath32 .",
    "the squared interval @xmath17 between these two events is given as function of these quantities , by definition , through the generalization of pythagorean theorem @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the maximum speed of signal propagation at the beginning of the universe expansion ( the maximum speed for the transmission of information ) .",

    "the above metrics , from the beginning of the universe expansion ( step 0 ) until the present time , quantify the expansion of the space - time step by step .",
    "indeed , a ball @xmath68 defined by @xmath69 will increase if its radius increases , and we have for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 however , for all @xmath73 , the sphere @xmath74 is an expanding sphere given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an increasing and bounded product .",
    "the infinitesimal space - time interval at the step n , @xmath71 , between two neighboring events within a locally inertial frame metric takes then the form @xmath77 in which @xmath78 represents the expansion step of the physical universe . in such locally inertial reference frame",

    "we propose to rewrite the physical laws in each space - time step by step to investigate any possible evolution in the laws of nature .",
    "the metric ( [ m1 ] ) can be written as @xmath79 with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",

    "let us consider two cartesian frames @xmath90 and @xmath91 in @xmath83 such that at each expansion step the equations of newtonian mechanics hold good .",

    "in general for a linear transformation of the cartesian frames we have @xmath96 where the coefficients @xmath97 depend on the movement . the general properties of homogeneity and isotropy of the space with the choice that the frame @xmath95 moves in the x direction of @xmath93 with uniform velocity @xmath98 ( without losing generality ) , such that the corresponding axes of @xmath93 and @xmath95 remain parallel throughout the motion having coincided at @xmath99 will give @xmath100 suppose that a light signal is emitted from the common center of the two frames at @xmath99 . since the space @xmath83 is expanding , then the observer in the frame @xmath93 will observe that the light travels in all direction in an expanding sphere , at the step n , given by @xmath101 and from the frame @xmath95 , the observer perceives the same @xmath102 and we have @xmath103 substituting formula ( [ e1 ] ) in ( [ e2 ] ) gives@xmath104,which yields the following system @xmath105 the resolution of the system ( [ e3 ] ) leads to the lorentz transformation equations @xmath4 with a new limiting velocity @xmath106      the first immediate consequence from the lorentz transformations in an expanding universe is the following : there exists a limiting velocity for moving bodies given by @xmath107 which depends on the fossil light velocity ( velocity of light at the beginning of the universe expansion ) and the expanding parameter of the universe .",
    "indeed , @xmath108 is an increasing and bounded product greater than one , then the limiting velocity @xmath109 is decreasing along with the space expansion of the universe .",
    "it turns out that the limiting velocity was maximal at the beginning of the expansion of the universe ( step 0 ) and was equal to @xmath34 , that is why we call it the fossil velocity of light .",
    "thus the limiting velocity of moving body , including the light , will decrease in an expanding universe .",
    "however , the physical meaning of the equations ( [ e4 ] ) obtained in respect to moving rigid bodies and moving clocks remain the same as for the classical lorentz transformations ( deformability and lose of synchronization , time transformations , etc ) except the fact that the expansion of the universe will be involved in all formulation of the physical laws as we will see later on .        as a consequence of these new transformations and taking into account the dynamic of the universe",
    ", we propose to adjust the einstein s equation relative to the mass - energy as follow : the total energy of moving body at the step n of the space expansion is given by the law @xmath110 and the body s rest - mass energy at the step n of the space expansion is given by the law @xmath111 where @xmath112 represents the mass of a body at rest relative to the observer in an expanding universe at the step n. the relative mass at the step n is given by the law @xmath113 indeed , using the newtonian formula @xmath114 , the equation ( [ e6 ] ) , and the fact that the newton s law remains valid if it is written as @xmath115 give the following : @xmath116 on the other hand we have @xmath117 and @xmath118 which yields in ( [ n1 ] ) @xmath119 then @xmath120 with @xmath121 . by integration",
    "we obtain @xmath122    for @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , we obtain @xmath125 and then @xmath126 which gives equation ( [ e7 ] ) . on the other hand the law ( [ e7 ] ) leads to the law ( [ e6 ] ) , indeed , the work of displacing a body by a distance @xmath127 at the step",
    "n is @xmath128 where @xmath98 is the velocity vector .",
    "if this work serves to increase the energy @xmath129 of the body at the step n , then @xmath130 then @xmath131 since @xmath132 is given by ( [ e7 ] ) , we have @xmath133 by substitution we obtain @xmath134 then @xmath135 which gives together with formula ( [ dm ] ) @xmath136 that is to say the law ( [ e6 ] ) .",
    "the universe dynamic does not affect the mass of a given object at rest .",
    "however , object at rest has a rest energy @xmath137 given by ( [ e0 ] ) in which the universe movement is manifested .",
    "when the object starts moving under any force , its total energy , momentum and mass are directly affected by the expansion parameters of the universe .",
    "if the speed @xmath34 is the fossil velocity of light , then the term @xmath138 in laws ( [ e6 ] ) , ( [ e0 ] ) , and ( [ e7 ] ) represents the current experimental velocity of light , of course if we consider that the present time corresponds to the step n of the universe expansion , and it constitutes a limiting velocity for any motion or transfer of interaction at the step n of the universe expansion .      for small values of @xmath139 ,",
    "the total energy ( [ e6 ] ) goes over into the classical expression of the kinetic energy as shown by @xmath140 which gives @xmath141 the first term represents @xmath137 the energy at rest , and the second term represents the newtonian kinetic energy .",
    "the relativistic kinetic energy @xmath142 or the motion energy at the expansion step n can be defined by subtracting the rest energy @xmath137 from the total energy @xmath129 @xmath143 the substitution of formula ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e0 ] ) in the last equality gives @xmath144 and using relative mass ( [ e7 ] ) we obtain @xmath145 the kinetic energy of a body is not only related to the increase of masses when they are moving as asserted by the special relativity but also related to the universe expansion .",
    "the use of equation ( [ e7 ] ) in the equation of motion ( force is equal to the rate of change of momentum ) remains valid .",
    "however , here the momentum is now at the step n given by : @xmath146 the equation @xmath147 determines the motion of a body acted on by any force , but now correctly takes expanding effects into account .",
    "clearly , the form of the momentum and force equation is very similar in relativity theory and in our approach ; the effective mass @xmath132 depends on the speed of motion of the body relative to the observer and the n - th step expansion parameter @xmath148 according to the formula ( [ e7 ] ) , while in relativity theory it is independent of the universe expansion .",
    "the crucial feature is that the effective mass @xmath132 diverges as @xmath98 tends to the limiting velocity @xmath149 and so the momentum @xmath150 also diverges . as for relativity theory , the energy and momentum are related . indeed , using formula ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) we obtain the following relation @xmath151",
    "like for special relativity we will use the classical definition of velocity .",
    "if we call @xmath152 the velocity of an object in the frame @xmath93 , its components with respect to the three axes are @xmath153 .",
    "the same velocity is measured in the frame @xmath95 as @xmath154 with components given by @xmath155 for simplicity and without losing generality , we will consider only that the velocity @xmath152 is parallel to the x - axes .",
    "a simple differentiation of the equations of lorentz transformations @xmath4 gives @xmath156 then we have @xmath157 which gives @xmath158 since @xmath152 is parallel to the x - axes , then the law of composition of velocity is given by @xmath159 and inversely @xmath160 which has the form of the relativist law of composition of velocity with the appearance of the term @xmath161 that characterizes the expansion of the universe at the step n. in the extreme case where an observer in the frame @xmath95 is emitting light signals in the direction of x - axis , since the frame is in an expanding universe at the step n , then the velocity of these signals in the frame @xmath95 is given by @xmath162 which gives @xmath163 which gives @xmath164 and then the limiting velocity of light @xmath109 at the step",
    "n is invariant , that is to say the velocity of light `` measured '' in a moving frame at the step n , appears to be equal to @xmath138 in any direction .",
    "the speed of light in vacuum , at the step n of the universe expansion , will be found the same ( equal to @xmath109 ) by any two observers in uniform relative motion and this is true for the whole process of universe expansion , meanwhile this speed is decreasing together with the universe expansion . for @xmath165",
    "the lorentz transformation @xmath166 gives @xmath34 as an invariant limiting velocity of matter , meanwhile @xmath167 gives @xmath168 as the invariant limiting velocity of matter , and so on , until the lorentz transformation @xmath4 which gives @xmath169 as the invariant limiting velocity of matter .",
    "it turns out that the limiting velocity of moving bodies is decreasing together with the universe expansion and that the velocity of light in empty space is independent of the velocity of its source _ at each step _ of the universe expansion despite of its decreasing nature together with the universe expansion . in the whole process of universe expansion",
    "the velocity of light remains independent of the reference frame of the observer .",
    "the formula ( [ e6 ] ) can be justified exactly as the famous formula @xmath0 ( einstein @xcite ) , by using the new composition of velocity provided by the lorentz transformation @xmath4 and the momentum conservation at the step n.",
    "the quantification of the expansion introduced above leads us to set up different steps - lorentz transformations @xmath3 that permit to quantify the physical laws evolution together with the universe expansion , and derive a relationship between the space - time views obtained by any two observers in an expanding universe .",
    "the result obtained unifies the fundamental special - relativity results of time dilation , length contraction , and the relativity of simultaneity , in a single relation for different steps of quantified expansion .",
    "however , from these different lorentz transformations , we sort out that the limiting velocity @xmath109 of matter is decreasing from one step to another including the velocity of light . the velocity of light at the beginning of the expansion of the universe ( step 0 ) was constant and equal to @xmath34 an unknown value , and the @xmath166-lorentz transformation equations are given by @xmath170 this transformation @xmath171 leads to the relativistic formulation of the physical laws @xmath172 on the other hand , at the step 1 the @xmath167-lorentz transformation equations become @xmath173 from which we sort out that the matter has a new limiting velocity @xmath174 . at this step",
    "all the equations of newtonian mechanics hold good , and the formulations of the physical laws are obtained under some changes relative to the new limiting velocity .",
    "similar formulations of the physical law equations ( [ t0 ] ) are introduced with the new limiting velocity and denoted by @xmath175 at the step n , the @xmath4-lorentz transformation equations become @xmath176 in which the limiting velocity of matter reaches the value of @xmath177 , and where all formulations of the physical laws are possible to obtain under some changes with the hypothesis that the equations of newtonian mechanics are valid at this step of the universe expansion ( conservation of momentum , conservation of energy , etc ) . the new limiting velocity @xmath177 at the step",
    "n induces some change in all formulations ( as regards both mechanics and electro - magnetism in inertial systems ) , including the maxwell equations , to obtain that the physical law remains the same under the @xmath4-lorentz transformations .",
    "the formulation of the physical law equations at the step n with the new limiting velocity @xmath109 are denoted by @xmath178 where the quantities @xmath129 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath132 take the form ( [ e6 ] ) , ( [ e0 ] ) , ( [ ec ] ) , ( [ e6 ] ) , and ( [ e7 ] ) respectively under the @xmath4-lorentz transformation for all @xmath10 .",
    "the lorentz transformations @xmath171 , @xmath182,@xmath183 , and @xmath184 have the same mathematical form , and all the physical quantities are affected by the space expansion from one step to another , except the rest - mass @xmath185 which is invariant under universe expansion . since the light has no rest frame , and since the formalism must be the same for all matter , the quantity @xmath185 in the above formalism represents in reality the mass of matter which is invariant under universe expansion , we will call it the _ invariant mass_. the family of transformation @xmath3 leads to fatal variation of the limiting velocity @xmath109 of moving bodies according to the universe expansion .",
    "this has interesting consequences . in the expansion process",
    "the rest energy at the step n can be evaluated compared to the rest energy at the beginning of the universe expansion .",
    "indeed , the rest energy at the step n is given by the law @xmath186 and using the rest energy notation we obtain @xmath187 which means that the rest energy of matter is decreasing along with the universe expansion .",
    "however , the relative mass of matter is increasing together with the universe expansion , indeed , from the law ( [ e7 ] ) at the step n and the same law at the step n+1 we sort out that @xmath188 and we obtain for all @xmath189 @xmath190 which gives @xmath191 this means that the relative mass of matter in our universe is increasing along with the universe expansion as well as the momentum , meanwhile the rest energy is decreasing .",
    "it is possible to determine the evolution of energy , momentum and relative mass together with the universe expansion by using the invariant mass @xmath185 , indeed , it is not difficult to write all these quantities at the step n function of their values at the step 0 ( beginning of the expansion ) and we have the law of evolution of the relative mass together with the universe expansion given by @xmath192 meanwhile the evolution of momentum together with the universe expansion is given by the law @xmath193 and the total energy evolution together with the universe expansion is given by the law @xmath194 however , the evolution of the physical laws from one step to another are given by the following formulas : @xmath195 the evolution of the momentum from one step to another is given by @xmath196 and the evolution of the total energy from one step to another is given by the law @xmath197 it turns out that the concept of expansion is a real source of energy , and this will be analyzed later on with a concrete example .",
    "the velocity of light was constant at the beginning of the expansion of our universe and equal to @xmath34 ( an unknown fossil value ) .",
    "what we measure today in our experiment and what we call the velocity of light , corresponds in reality to the velocity of light at the expansion step n , where its value is given by @xmath138 .",

    "we know only that the invariant mass and the rest energy of a photon are not null , they might be small , very small , but not null .      in the purpose to sort out the real nature of energy gained by matter in an expanding universe we introduce the following example of inelastic collision : consider two identical particles which move toward each other along straight line , with equal speeds , and equal invariant mass @xmath185 , they collide and stick together in an expanding space at the step n. the conservation of momentum at the step n gives : @xmath247 thus @xmath248 which gives @xmath249 , so the final object is at rest with mass @xmath250 .",

    "n , we obtain @xmath260 from which it turns out that @xmath259 represents the rate of decrease of the rest energy together with the universe expansion . since the mass of final object is larger than the sum of the original masses , we can approximate this excess of mass for a small value of @xmath255 , and compare it to the same value at the beginning of the universe expansion .",
    "indeed the approximation of the law ( [ mn ] ) , for all @xmath10 , gives @xmath261 which gives @xmath262 and then we obtain @xmath263 it turns out that the excess mass of the composite object at the step n of the universe expansion compared to the mass of the same composite object at the beginning of the expansion ( step 0 ) is increasing together with the universe expansion and then the kinetic energy brought in also increases . the lost kinetic energy has been converted to rest energy ( mass ) .",
    "the classical explanation for the loss of kinetic energy attributes it to conversion into thermal energy ( heat ) : the final object will have a higher temperature or a large internal energy . now since the mass of the final object ( after collision formula ( [ mn ] ) will have an increasing total mass , then this means that the temperature of the final object will increase together with the universe expansion .",
    "since many evidences prove that early earth was molten from bombardment of rocks and mini planets and others , then we can say that there must exist a natural factor that contributes to the global warming of our planet due to the universe expansion ( the global warming of our planet is not only attributed to human activities ! ) .",
    "suppose that we have an atom of uranium with rest mass @xmath264 measured in an expanding universe at the step n , and suppose that something happens so that the atom flies into two equal pieces moving with speed @xmath98 , so that each part has a relative mass @xmath132 at the step n .",
    "suppose that these pieces encounter enough material to slow them up until they stop and then each part will have an invariant mass @xmath124 .",
    "to reach its rest position each part will give an amount of energy left in the material in some form , whatever . the left energy for one part",
    "is then given by @xmath265 the conservation of total energy in an expanding universe at the step n gives @xmath266 so the total liberated energy at the step n is given by @xmath267 then @xmath268 which can be written as @xmath269 where @xmath270,@xmath271 .",
    "the law given by ( [ en2 ] ) for @xmath165 was used to estimate how much energy would be liberated under fission in the atomic bomb since the mass of uranium atom was known as well as the atoms into which it splits ( iodine , xenon , and so on ) .",
    "however , it turns out from the law ( [ en2 ] ) that the released energy when an atom of uranium undergoes fission is correlated to the universe expansion which has interesting consequences .",
    "as the universe expands we have the law ( [ mc ] ) , which gives @xmath272 and from ( [ en2 ] ) we have @xmath273 using the law ( [ en0 ] ) we obtain @xmath274 this means that the ratio between the total liberated energy by an atom of uranium and its rest energy is increasing together with the universe expansion .",
    "the total liberated energy by an atom of uranium ( [ en3 ] ) can be approximated , indeed , we have @xmath275 then we have @xmath276 by using the law ( [ en ] ) that expresses the correlation between the rest energy at the step n and the rest energy at the step 0 , we obtain @xmath277 for a small value of @xmath255 , we obtain the following approximation @xmath278 which gives @xmath279 then @xmath280 it turns out that the total liberated energy by an atom of uranium is increasing together with the universe expansion and we have for one atom of uranium the following evolution of liberated energy from one step to another @xmath281 this has interesting consequences that will change our understanding of gravity , the missing masses , or the estimation of stars energy and others .",
    "the energy in our universe increases together with the universe expansion , and this excess of energy is naturally due to the recession of galaxies from each other .",
    "the increase of energy and mass in our universe compensates the increase of distance between matters and might explain why the gravity exists at long distance .",
    "our estimation of stars energy , or galaxies masses are erroneous if we omit to take into account the movement of matter due to the universe expansion .",
    "we conclude by raising the fatal fact that there is no stationary safe distance when an atom of uranium undergoes fission in an expanding universe , since the liberated energy increases along with the universe expansion , the security of nuclear reactor must be endlessly reconsidered .",
    "it turns out that the tame of this energy is strewed with risk and peril together with the universe expansion .",
    "the family of transformations @xmath171 , @xmath182 , @xmath282 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 is a mathematical formulation of the lorentz transformation that incorporates the given quantification of the space expansion .",
    "this family of transformations @xmath283 is defined for all @xmath284 , where @xmath109 represents the limiting velocity of moving bodies at the expansion step n. from this limiting velocity it turns out that the velocity of light is decreasing as the universe expands , and the limiting velocity @xmath109 was maximal only at the step 0 ( in the beginning of the universe expansion @xmath232 ) , however , at each step the velocity of light is constant in the sense that it is independent of the reference frame of the observer .",
    "all formulations and laws based on the assumption that the velocity of light in empty space is independent of the velocity of its source remain valid for matter and related physical phenomenon during the universe expansion step by step , and the relativistic formulation of the physical laws remains valid _ experimentally _ since the velocity of light at the step n is experimentally given by @xmath285 which represents in this formalism @xmath138 , that is to say @xmath286 where c is the fossil velocity of light ( the fossil velocity of light could be detected in our space ) . at each step of the universe expansion",
    "the measured velocity of light remains invariant from one frame to another in uniform relative motion .",
    "the meaning of this approximation based on the universe quantification @xmath84 is that the velocity of light is constant locally and variable globally with respect to the universe age , and what we mean by constant locally is that the variation of the velocity of light is too small to be detected in short time with respect to the universe age .",
    "all our experimental tests and applications of the special relativity laws at present time are and remain valid since the substitution of the experimental measure of the light speed in the @xmath166-lorentz transformation will represent @xmath4-lorentz transformations .",
    "indeed , the velocity of light is locally constant at the scale of normal time ( using a short interval of time as unit ) and globally variable at the scale of cosmical time ( using a large interval of time as unit ) .",
    "this local and global behavior can be derived straight forward from the quantification @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , the local behavior is reached in the quantification @xmath6 if we use a big number of subdivisions : the bigger the used number @xmath78 of steps is the shorter the time interval of steps we obtain .",
    "thus , as @xmath78 tends to infinity , we have @xmath287 as a consequence of the convergence of the product @xmath148 , then @xmath288 where @xmath18 is a large positive real number . hence the equations ( [ cv ] ) and ( [ c ] ) give @xmath289 therefore the velocity of light is almost constant for short period of time ( locally ) . however , the equation ( [ cst ] ) is not valid anymore for the large period of time .",
    "indeed , the smaller the used number @xmath78 of steps is the bigger the time interval of steps we obtain , and in that case we have @xmath290 for all @xmath291 and @xmath292 hence the equations ( [ c ] ) and ( [ cv0 ] ) lead to the following inequality : @xmath293 that is to say the velocity of light is decreasing globally together with the universe expansion from one step to another .",
    "the formalism obtained within this work using a special expansion notion in the special relativity theory to study the uniform motion of the observer relative to the source is based on the validity of the special relativity theory step by step from the big bang to nowadays . which leads to the conclusion that this new formalism is an extension of the special relativity theory .",
    "we close this article by some comments on the notion of time .",
    "the notion of relative time as for special relativity remains valid with some adjustment , from the metric ( [ m1 ] ) is clear that time is a required coordinate to specify a physical event and that this quantity can not be defined without the notion of space and the notion of expansion , the dynamic of the universe is involved in the definition of time .",
    "the expansion of the universe affects the time and the space .",
    "if we refer to the proper time @xmath294 as the time which is measured by an observer in a reference frame at the step n of the universe expansion in which the events occur at the same spatial point , then @xmath295 and the metric ( [ m1 ] ) gives @xmath296 meanwhile in another inertial reference frame the same events will verify ( [ m1 ] ) , which gives @xmath297 from which we obtain @xmath298 where @xmath299 .",
    "it turns out that the rate of proper time for a system varies with motion through space as for special relativity , and what is new here is that the rate of the proper time varies together with the universe expansion even if @xmath98 is constant .",
    "if we refer to the universe proper time @xmath300 as the time which is measured by an observer in a reference frame at rest at the step n of the universe expansion in which the events occur at the same spatial point , it is not difficult to extract from the metric ( [ m1 ] ) the relationship between proper time and coordinate time @xmath301 the time depends on the observer and the universe expanding step .",
    "what is new here is to associate space , time and expansion in the definition of event .",
    "any change of reference or steps affects all of them .",
    "if the proper time @xmath300 of the universe is the same from one step to another and if the velocity @xmath98 and @xmath34 are constant from one step to another then it turns out from the step @xmath302 to the step @xmath78 that @xmath303 and then @xmath304 which allows us to compare the coordinate time between successive steps as @xmath305 which means that the clocks at the step n will run slower than an identical type of clocks at the previous step , the time will run slower together with the universe expansion .",
    "one more thing , the product @xmath148 which allows the quantification of the universe expansion was extracted from the fractal manifold model @xcite .",
