    "granular media show an interesting and peculiar dynamic behavior @xcite , and are also of major importance in technological processes .",
    "one of the standard problems of the powder technology is the mixing of materials @xcite .",
    "it is often accompanied by pattern formation like stratification @xcite or segregation @xcite .",
    "the axial and radial segregation in rotating - drum mixers with dry multicomponent mixtures , like small and large particles or particles of different densities , has been investigated .",
    "the different angles of repose of the two species are considered as the segregation mechanism for the axial segregation .",
    "the separation of large and small particles has recently been observed in a mixture of particles dispersed in a lower density fluid @xcite . in the presence of a fluid the time for the pattern formation",
    "is significantly decreased .",
    "granular media immersed in a fluid show a type of segregation even for monodisperse particles @xcite .",
    "the volume fraction of granular particles in these experiments is much less than in the previous cases .",
    "furthermore , the driving frequency of the drum is sufficiently high for the centrifugal forces to become dominant .",
    "the observed pattern is a chain of circumferential rings of high particle concentration .",
    "et al . _ reported on this type of axial segregation in partially filled horizontal cylinders @xcite .",
    "in both cases they used suspensions of particles , which were neutrally buoyant .",
    "if the device was completely filled with the suspension , no instability was observed at all .",
    "the experiment was modeled theoretically by govindarajan _",

    "boote and thomas@xcite , and thomas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported similar experiments with particle densities less and more dense than the surrounding fluid in a partially fluid - filled cylinder .",
    "for particles of a different density than the fluid , the free surface is not necessary for the instability .",
    "lipson observed this phenomenon during crystal growth in a supersaturated solution @xcite .    in this publication",
    "we present experiments on axial segregation of monodisperse particles which have a higher density than the surrounding fluid .",
    "the experiments have been carried out in a drum , which was completely filled with a sand - water mixture .",
    "we estimate an upper boundary for the critical frequency for the onset of the pattern formation by the numerical analysis of the trajectory of a single particle .",
    "the experimental setup is shown schematically in ( a ) .",
    "the experiment consists of a horizontally aligned plexiglass tube , which is @xmath0 long .",
    "its inner diameter measures @xmath1 .",
    "both ends are closed with plexiglass plugs .",
    "the tube is filled with ( by volume ) glass beads and water .",
    "this is sufficient to reach about of the close packing for a monolayer on a cylindrical surface .",
    "the glass beads are ballotini impact beads with a density of @xmath2 and diameters between @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "one end of the tube is attached rigidly to a dc - motor , which rotates the tube around its cylinder axis .",
    "the motor speed is controlled with an accuracy of @xmath5 .",
    "the control unit allows rotation frequencies",
    "@xmath6 from @xmath7 to @xmath8 in steps of @xmath9 with a maximal acceleration of @xmath10 .",
    "the axial sand distribution in the tube is measured via light transmission , with a neon light placed behind the tube .",
    "a ccd camera , connected to a frame grabber , detects the intensity of the transmitted light .",
    "each frame consists of a narrow strip ( 512 @xmath11 5 pixels ) along the tube displaying high sand concentrations as dark stripes in a bright surrounding ( fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "the experimental protocol consists of a stepwise increase or decrease of the rotation frequency from @xmath12 to @xmath13 followed by a subsequent waiting period of @xmath14 , after which transients have disappeared .",
    "no patterns are visible for high frequencies above @xmath15 and frequencies below @xmath16 ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) . at intermediate frequencies patterns",
    "appear , depending on the history of the system .",
    "thus we display the intensities for increasing and decreasing rotation frequencies in part ( a ) and ( b ) of .",
    "alternatively we characterize the pattern by a discrete fourier decomposition of the lines ( fig .",
    "[ patterns ] ) .",
    "as soon as the rings appear , well defined peaks show up in the power spectrum . in the case of decreasing rotation frequencies the first peak",
    "is located at @xmath17 , which corresponds to a ring spacing of @xmath18 . for frequencies below @xmath19",
    "the first peak almost vanishes and a peak at @xmath20 becomes dominant , due to a splitting of the rings .",
    "the pattern returns to @xmath21 for frequencies between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "below @xmath23 the particles start to accumulate at the right hand side of the tube . whether the system chose the right or the left side",
    "could not be predicted in advance . for rotation frequencies below @xmath16",
    "the sand distributed again homogeneously in the tube .",
    "increasing the rotation frequency leads to a different scenario as shown in fig .",
    "[ patterns](a ) and [ patterns](c ) . there",
    "the characteristic ring spacing is almost constant at @xmath21 .",
    "no accumulation at a tube end was observed even after waiting periods of 30 min .    to get a more precise picture of the transition points ,",
    "we take as an order parameter the root mean square @xmath24 of the measured intensities along the axes of rotation ( fig .",
    "[ amplitude ] ) .",
    "we observe two hysteresis loops , which are related to the transitions between structured and unstructured states .",
    "these hysteresis loops indicate that the transitions can be considered as subcritical bifurcations .    in order to characterize the bifurcation around @xmath25",
    "further we now concentrate on the temporal evolution of the instability .",
    "we assume @xmath26 where @xmath27 describes the amplitude for a given wave number of the pattern , and @xmath28 the growth rate . to measure @xmath28 as a function of the driving frequency we start at a rotation frequency , where the granular medium forms a homogeneous layer ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "then we decelerate the motor suddenly to a frequency where the ring pattern is stable ( @xmath30 ) . due to this sudden change",
    ", the pattern will grow in time , as described by equation ( [ aeq ] ) to lowest order .",
    "figure [ growth ] shows the growth of the amplitude in time after a jump from @xmath13 to @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ growth](b ) ) , and to @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "[ growth](a ) ) .",
    "the amplitude in this plot was obtained from the power spectrum by selecting the mode @xmath33 , which is the first stable one if the rotation frequency is decreased quasistatically ( see fig .",
    "[ patterns](d ) ) .",
    "the solid line is the fit of an exponential function to the data . at higher amplitudes",
    "the growth is no longer exponential .",
    "in fact , the amplitudes decays after @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ growth](a ) ) .",
    "this non - monotonic effect is caused by a rearrangement of the pattern towards a higher wave number .",
    "this quenching of the system was performed for final rotation frequencies between 3.4 hz and 3.9 hz . above 3.65 hz no growth of the pattern",
    "was observed within a measurement time of 5 minutes .",
    "below @xmath22 it was not possible to measure a growth rate for @xmath21 . for frequencies between 3.633 hz and 3.567 hz",
    "the final stable mode was @xmath21 . at lower frequencies",
    "this mode first grew in time and decayed afterwards , being replaced by the higher stable mode @xmath35 . nevertheless , it was also possible to extract a growth rate for these frequencies , but with less accuracy , as indicated by the error bars in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] .",
    "all measured growth rates are plotted as a function of the rotation frequency in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] . for @xmath6 between 3.55 hz and 3.65 hz the growth rate of the mode",
    "@xmath21 increases roughly linearly with decreasing frequency , and saturates around 3.4 hz , due to the different stable mode @xmath35 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ growth](a ) . to model the increasing growth rate as well as the saturation",
    ", we fitted a parabola to the data .",
    "this parabola was then used to extrapolate the data for @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding critical rotation frequency is @xmath37 .",
    "in order to estimate an upper boundary for the critical rotation frequency @xmath38 we analyze the motion of a single particle in the laboratory frame , neglecting the interaction with the neighboring particles .",
    "the calculation estimates the frequency for the detachment of a particle from the wall , which is a necessary , but not a sufficient criterion for pattern formation .",
    "a complete understanding of the instability can not be achieved by this simple calculation . at high rotation frequencies",
    "the suspension is in rigid body rotation , and the particle sticks to the inner wall of the tube . below a critical frequency",
    "the particle detaches from the wall and falls on a parabola - like trajectory described by the equation of motion @xmath39 @xmath40 represents the force of gravity , reduced by buoyancy : @xmath41 @xmath42 is the radius of the particle , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the density of the particle and the fluid , respectively .",
    "the drag of the fluid on the particle is modelled by a modified stokes formula @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the dynamic viscosity of the fluid . @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the velocity of the particle and the fluid , respectively , at the position of the particle .",
    "for the fluid velocity @xmath48 we assume that the fluid is in rigid body rotation .",
    "since the particle velocity is approximately equal to the fluid velocity , the reynolds number is close to zero .",
    "@xmath49 is the correction of the stokes formula for particles close to the wall , derived by brenner for vanishing reynolds number @xcite : @xmath50\\ , , \\label{wallcorrection}\\ ] ] where the particle radius dependence which is taken care of by @xmath51 is defined as @xmath52 @xmath53 is the distance of the sphere s surface to the wall .",
    "while the detachment point can be calculated analytically @xcite , the path of the particle is obtained by numerical integration of the equation of motion ( [ equation_of_motion ] ) .",
    "note that the particle , at the detachment point , has a distance of @xmath55 from the center of the tube .",
    "@xmath56 is the inner radius and @xmath57 the surface roughness of the tube .",
    "it is necessary to include the surface roughness , since the wall correction ( [ wallcorrection ] ) becomes singular for vanishing distance @xmath53 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath58 , which is a typical value for cast processes .",
    "starting from the detachment point , we integrate the equation of motion ( [ equation_of_motion ] ) until the particles touched the wall of the tube again .",
    "three different trajectories are shown in fig .",
    "[ simulation](a ) .    from these trajectories",
    "we calculate the distance of the particle from the tube wall as a function of time .",
    "each curve has a unique maximum @xmath59 , which depends on the rotation frequency of the tube .",
    "we determined numerically this maximal distance for different rotation frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ simulation](b ) ) . for the rearrangement of the particles , which initially tend to form a close packed monolayer , into separated rings",
    ", some individual particles have to jump over their neighbors . in order to do this",
    "they have to achieve at least a distance @xmath59 equal to one particle diameter .",
    "if the distance is less than the diameter , particles will not be able to pass their neighbors .",
    "therefore the critical frequency is found at the distance @xmath59 equal to one particle diameter @xmath60 . by this",
    "we obtain a critical rotation frequency of @xmath61 , which is in agreement with the experimental value of @xmath62 .",
    "a detailed theoretical investigation of the interaction between sand and water leading to the ring pattern remains to be done .",
    "a two - fluid approach might be difficult , since the primary flow is not trivial @xcite .",
    "a molecular - dynamics simulation @xcite , taking into account both the trajectories of the grains and the fluid flow , seems to be more promising ."
