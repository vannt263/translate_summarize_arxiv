    "one of the main objectives of the _ laser interferometric space antenna _",
    "( _ lisa _ ) , to be launched around the year 2013 @xcite , is to detect the gravitational wave ( gw ) signals associated with coalescing supermassive black holes ( smbh ) at cosmological distances .",
    "the _ lisa _",
    "detector is designed to be particularly sensitive in the frequency range between @xmath8 , allowing the detection of binary coalescences with total masses between @xmath9 and @xmath10 out to high redshifts .",
    "the limiting redshift depends on several factors ( such as the orientation of the spins and orbital plane of the smbh binary , and its location on the sky relative to _ lisa _ ) , and is expected to lie between @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the gravitational waveform with the anticipated detector noise can be used to estimate the accuracy with which _ lisa _ will be able to extract the physical parameters of the coalescence events @xcite .",
    "of particular interest , in the context of searching for electromagnetic ( em ) counterparts , is whether the spatial location of the gw event can be localized to within a sufficiently small three - dimensional volume . in this paper",
    ", we determine the probability of finding a unique em counterpart within the expected error volume associated with smbh merger events , for a range of masses and redshifts .",
    "it has been argued by @xcite that the identification of such em counterparts will be difficult because , in typical cases , there will be too many counterpart candidates to choose from .",
    "however , @xcite associated counterparts with host galaxies and galaxy clusters , and used only the 2d angular positioning information for the analysis .",
    "in contrast , here we account for the 3d spatial information by using the redshift of an electromagnetic counterpart candidate in relation with the luminosity distance determined by _",
    "lisa _ and we focus on quasars as plausible counterparts . with these specifications , we shall demonstrate that in some cases , a specific counterpart can be uniquely determined .",
    "if electromagnetic counterparts to _ lisa _",
    "events exist , they will likely be related to the accretion of gas onto the smbhs involved in the coalescence .",
    "provided this accretion is not supply - limited , bright quasar counterparts approaching the eddington luminosity would then be expected .",
    "a few additional arguments favor this scenario : galaxy mergers in hierarchical scenarios of structure formation are expected to deliver a significant amount of gas to the central regions of the merging galaxies @xcite , and this gas may play a catalyst role in driving smbh coalescence @xcite .",
    "ultimately , however , many of the complex processes involved remain poorly understood . for example , @xcite have argued that , in the limit of a small mass ratio of the two smbhs , a prompt and luminous electromagnetic signal may be expected during coalescence , while @xcite have argued that in the limit of equal mass smbhs , only a much delayed electromagnetic afterglow would be expected .",
    "all `` cosmological standard sirens '' may thus not be equal in their potential for electromagnetic counterparts .",
    "our working assumption in the present study is that bright quasar activity is a plausible electromagnetic counterpart to _ lisa _ events .",
    "this allows us to quantify the feasibility of an unambiguous identification of such a counterpart . as we shall see below",
    ", the search for the counterparts will allow a test of the assumption , as well .",
    "the secure identification of the em counterpart to even a single gw event could be useful in different ways : ( 1 ) to improve our understanding of the smbh accretion physics , ( 2 ) to clarify the role of gas as a catalyst in smbh mergers and ( 3 ) to supply an independent constraint on the background cosmology . a joint gw  em analysis could , in principle , determine the masses and orbital parameters of the smbh binary , and yield a precise measurement of the eddington ratio , @xmath12 , which will supply a key parameter in studies of the evolution of the bh / quasar population @xcite .",
    "this parameter is currently poorly known ( constrained by indirect empirical correlations ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the values range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , with indications that higher - z quasars may be closer to @xmath15 than the @xmath16 quasars .",
    "likewise , a joint gw ",
    "em analysis could , in principle , be used to estimate cosmological parameters @xcite , by comparing the luminosity distance ( which is a direct observable by gws ) with the redshift ( as inferred from the spectrum of the counterpart  in this case , a quasar ) .",
    "this would serve as a complement to constraints from the luminosity distance to high-@xmath17 type ia supernovae ( sne ) , but with different systematic errors , and with the potential of extending to higher redshifts .",
    "new constraints , spanning the range @xmath18 , would be particularly well  suited to probe the properties of dark energy , which is expected to become dynamically dominant within this cosmic epoch .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : lisaerrors ] , we summarize our method to estimate the angular and radial positioning errors expected from _",
    ", for smbhs with a range of masses at different redshifts . in   [ sec :",
    "dlerrors ] , we discuss the conversion of the luminosity distance , as determined by _",
    "lisa _ from the gw signal alone , to the redshift of the source . in particular , we discuss the uncertainty in the resulting redshift estimate . in ",
    "[ sec : qsolf ] , we discuss our estimates for the number of quasars that may be found in the 3d error volume provided by _",
    ", based on the luminosity function and clustering properties of known optical quasars . in   [ sec : results ] , we present our main results , and show that for typical low - redshift gw events discovered by _ lisa _ , a unique quasar counterpart may be identified . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we point out various implications of a successful identification and discuss several caveats to this conclusion .",
    "finally , in   [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions . unless stated otherwise , throughout this paper we assume a standard cold ",
    "dark matter cosmology ( @xmath19cdm ) , with ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) = ( 0.70 , 0.30 , 0.047 , 70 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 ) , consistent with the recent results from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap)_@xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "a few studies have been carried out so far to address how accurately _ lisa _ will measure the source parameters of a coalescing pair of smbhs . in general , the accuracy depends on a large number of parameters : a total of 17 parameters in the most general case include 2 red - shifted mass parameters , 6 parameters related to the bh spin vectors , the orbital eccentricity , the luminosity distance , 2 angles identifying the position on the sky , 3 angles that describe the orientation of the orbit , a reference time , and a reference phase . due to the resulting computational limitations ,",
    "various studies have concentrated on small portions of the parameter space .",
    "the most up  to  date calculations estimating parameter uncertainties for smbh in - spirals have been carried out by @xcite ; @xcite ; and by @xcite . as compared to previous studies , @xcite accounts for the effects of spins , and shows that parameter estimation errors improve significantly ( by a factor of 310 for high spins ) for selected parameters .",
    "@xcite also adopts an optimistic _ lisa _ sensitivity curve , by adopting the smallest observable frequency to be @xmath25 times lower than previous estimates and only considers cases with equal mass smbhs .",
    "our analysis , which relies on vecchio s estimates , is therefore approximate to this extent .",
    "lrrrr best & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 + typical & @xmath27 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 + worst & @xmath33 & 0.1 & @xmath34 & @xmath35    for concreteness , we adopt the parameter uncertainties obtained by @xcite for an equal - mass smbh binary with @xmath36 at redshift @xmath3 .",
    "the uncertainties vary as a function of the fiducial orientation of the source relative to _ lisa _ , and are primarily influenced by the bh spin magnitudes ( i.e. higher spins lead to smaller uncertainties ) . here",
    "we distinguish three cases . for our  best  case",
    ", we adopt the errors that correspond to the 10th percentile of the distribution of uncertainties obtained by @xcite for high bh spins ( with dimensionless spin @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the magnitude of the total spin and @xmath39 is the total mass ) . for our  typical  case , we adopt the errors corresponding to the 50th percentile in the case of moderate bh spins , with @xmath40 . for our  worst  case ,",
    "we adopt the 90th percentile of the no spin case ( @xmath41 ) . note that smbhs are generally expected to be spinning fast ( e.g. @xcite ) , so that our `` best '' case may actually be representative of a fair fraction of events . in table  [",
    "tab : lisa ] , we list the errors on the chirp and reduced masses , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , and on the gw source location ( i.e. luminosity distance , @xmath44 , and solid angle , @xmath45 ) , for these three cases of interest .    in @xcite ,",
    "parameter errors have only been estimated for a single choice of an equal  mass smbh binary with total mass @xmath46 and redshift @xmath47 .",
    "starting from this result , we crudely estimate the uncertainties @xmath48 and @xmath49 for other combinations of masses and redshifts as follows .",
    "first , note that the luminosity distance is simply proportional to the inverse of the signal amplitude .",
    "therefore its estimator depends primarily on the total signal power , rather than on the specific shape of the signal waveform .",
    "however , this parameter can be determined independently to high precision , from the phase information . ] .",
    "the luminosity distance error would then obey the simple scaling @xmath50^{-1 } \\frac{\\delta{d_{\\rm l}}(m_0,z_0)}{{d_{\\rm l}}(m_0,z_0)}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the expected value of the signal to noise ratio of the detection , @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is the red - shifted total mass , @xmath54 denotes the fourier decomposition of the signal detected by _",
    "lisa _ , and @xmath55 is the rms noise density per frequency interval ( including instrumental and confusion noise , @xcite ) .",
    "a crucial parameter for high @xmath56 values inscribed in @xmath55 is the low frequency wall of the detector , which is further discussed below .",
    "the integration bound @xmath57 corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , beyond which the gravitational waveform is not well known , and @xmath58 is the arrival frequency a time @xmath59 before the isco is reached by the coalescing binary ( see @xcite for details ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we fix the observation time of smbh binaries at @xmath60  yr , unless a binary is so massive or at such a high redshift that it is not observable by _ lisa _ for a full year and then @xmath61  yr .",
    "note that @xmath54 depends on other parameters , such as the angular momentum vector orientation relative to _ lisa _ s arms , the magnitude of spins , etc .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein ) . for this estimate",
    "we calculate the @xmath62 with the leading order ( i.e. newtonian ) contribution .",
    "the resulting dependence of the signal  to  noise ratio on bh masses and redshift are shown in figure  [ fig : snr ] .",
    "the figure shows that the sensitivity degrades significantly for distant sources , and also that it peaks in the mass range of @xmath63 , which produce gws near the optimal frequencies within the _ lisa _ band .",
    "the other important parameter , the angular position , is extracted from the change in the relative orientation of _ lisa _ during its orbit around the sun . since _",
    "s orbital time ",
    "scale is much longer than the inverse of the signal frequency , it is plausible to assume that the angular position uncertainty decouples from the intricate waveform , and improves linearly with the signal amplitude .",
    "this assumption is consistent with fig . 1 of @xcite which shows that the inclusion of spin - orbit and spin - spin terms modifies the waveforms but does not alter the angular resolution .",
    "in fact , the angular resolution is shown to be independent even for alternate theories of gravity ( e.g. scalar - tensor and massive graviton theories ) .",
    "thus , similar to equation  ( [ eq : ddl(m , z ) ] ) , we estimate the mass and redshift dependence of the positioning solid - angle error as @xmath64^{-2 } \\delta\\omega(m_0,z_0),\\ ] ] where the @xmath65 exponent assumes that the uncertainty in this two  dimensional quantity is the product of independent uncertainties in the one - dimensional azimuthal and polar angles .",
    "a limitation of the above analysis at the high  mass end of the range of smbhs is that these events may not be visible for a full year , due to the low  frequency noise wall , below which _ lisa _ looses sensitivity .",
    "for instance , for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , the low frequency noise wall at 0.03mhz ( 0.1mhz ) is crossed less than @xmath68 before reaching the isco . at higher masses or redshifts , therefore , the angular information , which is inscribed in a modulation with a @xmath69 period , becomes significantly harder to disentangle from other parameters , such as @xmath44 , and the errors estimated from the snr alone by equations  ( [ eq : ddl(m , z ) ] ) and ( [ eq : domega(m , z ) ] ) become less accurate .",
    "in this regime , a better approximation to the scaling of the errors is @xmath70 , where @xmath71  yr is the time elapsed from the moment the binary appears at the low  frequency wall to the moment it reaches the isco ( hughes 2005 , private communication ; see @xcite for a more detailed treatment and discussion ) .",
    "we next consider how to use the three  dimensional spatial localization of the smbh merger event by _ lisa_.",
    "the solid angle error box directly yields the two  dimensional angular position error on the sky , in which any em counterpart will be located . however , an additional step is necessary to convert the luminosity distance , @xmath44 , measured by _",
    "lisa _ into a redshift , @xmath17 , which is the relevant observable for the em counterpart . with a particular choice of cosmological parameters @xmath72",
    ", we can directly convert a redshift to a luminosity distance ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dl(z , p ) ] below ) , and vice  versa .",
    "one may then envision the following strategy : given the precision with which @xmath73 are known from other observations , one can estimate the redshift , and restrict the search for counterparts within the redshift shell corresponding to the _ lisa_-measured luminosity distance , @xmath44 .",
    "if a counterpart is uniquely identified within this redshift shell , and its redshift can be determined precisely , then one could hope for an improved measurement of the @xmath74 relation , and hence a refined determination of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the first step in this exercise is to determine the expected redshift of the source .",
    "apart from the errors on the cosmological parameters and on the measurement of @xmath44 , the peculiar velocity of the source relative to the hubble flow , and its magnification due to weak gravitational lensing by inhomogeneities in the distribution of mass along the line of sight , introduce two additional sources of errors . in summary",
    ", the redshift uncertainty will thus include a combination of uncertainties from ( i ) the _ lisa _ luminosity distance , ( ii ) the cosmological parameters , ( iii ) peculiar velocities , and ( iv ) weak gravitational lensing magnification .",
    "@xcite made a simplified estimate of the redshift error , without peculiar velocities or gravitational lensing distortions , assuming a flat cosmology with a cosmological constant ( assuming @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , and ignoring correlations with other cosmological parameters .",
    "here , we extend that study by using a general form of dark energy ( relaxing the @xmath77 prior ) , by taking into account the various parameter correlations , and by including errors due to peculiar velocities and gravitational lensing .",
    "to begin , we recall the luminosity distance to a source at a fixed comoving coordinate in a smooth friedmann universe , @xmath78 where @xmath79",
    "we ignore spatial curvature and set @xmath80 , in line with previous studies and as suggested by recent _",
    "wmap _ data . for a source with a small but non  zero radial peculiar velocity , @xmath81 , equation  ( [ eq : dl(z , p ) ] ) is modified , and the luminosity distance is given by @xmath82,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the additional apparent redshift due to the peculiar motion . in an inhomogeneous universe , sources along different lines of sight can suffer different amounts of gravitational lensing magnification @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath84 denotes the magnification of the signal power , then the gw amplitude , and thus the inferred value of @xmath85 , scales as @xmath86 . for a line of sight that suffers a magnification @xmath84 , equation  ( [ eq : dl(z , p , v ) ] ) is modified as @xmath87.\\ ] ] in the limit of weak lensing @xmath88 , where @xmath89 denotes the weak lensing convergence ( see below ) .    taking the variation in both sides of equation  ( [ eq : dl(z , p , v , mu ) ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath90 solving for @xmath91 , taking the square and the expectation value of both sides , and using the fact that the _ lisa _ measurement , the peculiar velocities , and the cosmological uncertainties are independent , i.e. @xmath92 for all @xmath93 , we find @xmath94 or equivalently , @xmath95 where the notation was introduced to distinguish the intrinsic _ lisa _ measurement error , @xmath96 , from the error resulting from cosmological parameters @xmath97 , peculiar velocities @xmath98 , and weak lensing magnification @xmath99 .",
    "we now discuss each of these terms , whose forms and magnitudes follow directly from equation  ( [ eq : dl(z , p , v , mu ) ] ) .      the cosmological term in equation  ( [ eq : delta_z^2 ] ) is @xmath100 where @xmath44 and its derivatives are to be evaluated using equation  ( [ eq : dl(z , p ) ] ) , at the fiducial values of the cosmological parameters @xmath73 , and for @xmath101 . in order to place",
    "lisa _ in the context of other experiments planned in the next decade , we compute @xmath102 from the covariance matrices @xmath103 expected from two future cosmological probes : _ planck _ ( assumed to have measured the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ) , and the large synoptic survey telescope , lsst ( assumed to have measured the power spectrum and redshift distribution of @xmath104 galaxy clusters ) .",
    "we adopt the forecasts for the fisher matrices for these experiments by @xcite .",
    "their analysis assumes a flat background universe with 6 free parameters @xmath105 where @xmath106 defines the hubble parameter .",
    "note that the luminosity distance does not explicitly depend on @xmath107 and @xmath108 , but they are included here , since they couple to the other four parameters as determined by _ planck _ and lsst ( and hence increase the uncertainties on these other four parameters ) .",
    "the fiducial parameters are @xmath109 , respectively ( consistent with _ wmap _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the two observations are independent , we simply sum up the two individual fisher matrices ; the covariance matrix , @xmath103 , is obtained by taking the inverse of the fisher matrix . in order to substitute in equation  ( [ eq : delta d_lc ] ) ,",
    "it is necessary either to revert to the original cosmological parameters @xmath110 in the correlation matrix , by performing an orthogonal transformation in the parameter space and @xmath111 will be fully anti - correlated , because of the assumption of flatness . ] , or to simply write @xmath112 of equation  ( [ eq : dl(z , p ) ] ) in terms of the parameters @xmath113 and evaluate the partial derivatives in equation  ( [ eq : delta d_lc ] ) as a function of these parameters .",
    "following either approach , we find @xmath114 for @xmath3 . for comparison , we performed the same analysis using the fisher matrices of wmap ( using only temperature anisotropies ) and sdss ( using the power spectrum of the luminous red galaxies , together with the galaxies in the main sdss survey , and following @xcite for redshift binning , mass limit , and sky coverage ) .",
    "we find @xmath115 for @xmath3 in that case .",
    "the luminosity distance error corresponds to a redshift error according to equation  ( [ eq : delta_z^2 ] ) . note that equation  ( [ eq : delta d_lc ] ) depends on the fiducial redshift through the @xmath44 derivatives .",
    "this dependence of the redshift error is shown as a long  dashed curve in figure  [ fig : dz ] , along with other sources of redshift errors .",
    "the luminosity distance at @xmath116 is measured very accurately by _ planck _ , and its evolution is essentially unaffected by the cosmological parameters down to dark - energy domination at @xmath117 .",
    "the figure shows that , as a result , the relative cosmological error @xmath118 reaches a constant value beyond @xmath119 .",
    "the figure also shows that the cosmology error becomes smaller than the typical lisa uncertainty at @xmath120 .",
    "we find that , even for our best  case _ lisa _ events , the cosmology error becomes sub ",
    "dominant at @xmath121 .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : dl(z , p , v ) ] ) , ( [ eq : delta dl ] ) , and ( [ eq : delta_z^2 ] ) yield , to first non - vanishing order in @xmath122 , the uncertainty due to peculiar velocities , as a simple function of the r.m.s .",
    "peculiar velocity of the gw sources , @xmath123 ^ 2   \\frac{\\langle v^2\\rangle}{c^2}.\\ ] ] we are assuming here that gw events correspond to luminous quasars , and unfortunately , the r.m.s .",
    "peculiar velocity of high - redshift quasars is not known empirically .",
    "we therefore employ theoretical predictions for the peculiar velocities of ( quasar  host ) galaxies within dark matter haloes . according to numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) , typical values are @xmath124 , with a tail extending to @xmath125 . as an approximation",
    ", we assume that the scaling with redshift follows the linear growth in the amplitude of density perturbations , multiplied by the linear bias of the halos . under this assumption",
    ", we find that for fixed halo mass , the typical peculiar velocity evolves very little from @xmath16 to @xmath5 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the semi - analytic model of @xcite , which shows essentially no evolution ( only a modest decrease from @xmath16 to @xmath126 ) . therefore , we substitute @xmath127 in equation  ( [ eq : delta d_lv ] ) at @xmath128 , yielding an error of @xmath129 .",
    "the corresponding redshift r.m.s .",
    "error contribution ( equation  [ [ eq : delta_z ] ] ) for @xmath130 is shown as a function of redshift in figure  [ fig : dz ] ( short  dashed curve ) .",
    "the figure shows that the peculiar velocity error is lower than the typical _ lisa _ error for @xmath121 .",
    "note that the r.m.s .",
    "peculiar velocity equals @xmath131 in the most typical cases , but its exact value depends on the specific mass of the halo , @xmath132 , embedding the quasar @xcite , smaller @xmath132 implying lower velocities . for a specific source , @xmath132 can be estimated directly , using the number of galaxies that cluster around the identified quasar @xcite . the r.m.s .",
    "peculiar velocity error may then be estimated for this particular source , and may be somewhat lower / higher than the value shown in figure  [ fig : dz ] , depending on whether the source is located in a galaxy  poor / galaxy  rich environment .",
    "the gravitational lensing term in equation  ( [ eq : delta_z^2 ] ) , in the weak - lensing limit , is given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the r.m.s .",
    "effective convergence ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while the mean magnification is well approximated by @xmath135 or @xmath136 , the magnification distribution has a substantial width .",
    "the full distribution is given by @xcite , and its variance reaches @xmath137 for sources at @xmath138 @xcite . here",
    "we use equation  ( 6 ) in @xcite to compute the variance in effective convergence , @xmath139 , for point sources .",
    "this quantity is given by an integral over the matter power spectrum , and receives a contribution from small , non  linear scales .",
    "we employ the halofit routine of @xcite , and set the input cosmological parameters according to our convention ( see   [ sec : introduction ] ) .",
    "this routine encodes an accurate fitting formula for the matter power spectrum extending into the nonlinear regime . for @xmath3 , we find @xmath140 .",
    "weak lensing errors can , in principle , be improved by `` corrective lenses '' ( @xcite ) , i.e. background galaxy shear maps , and using the cross - correlation between the magnification of a point source and the shear map smoothed on larger  scales .",
    "however , @xcite found that the magnification errors can be improved by only a small amount , less then 20% relative to the uncorrected errors for a source at @xmath138 .    a different approach for reducing weak lensing magnification uncertainty would be to directly measure the inhomogeneities in the mass distribution along the line of sight .",
    "if this distribution could be directly probed down to a scale of @xmath141 , then the contributions to @xmath134 from all scales down to @xmath141 could be directly subtracted from the uncertainty on the magnification . if the counterpart is indeed a quasar , then the line - of - sight density distribution could , in principle , be probed by studying its lyman @xmath142 absorption spectrum , as well as deep surveys of galaxies and clusters in the foreground and near the line of sight . at low redshifts ( @xmath143 ) which contribute significantly to the lensing magnification",
    ", the x - ray absorption forest @xcite could provide additional information on the density fluctuations .",
    "we leave a detailed assessment of the amount of correction that could be feasible to future investigations .",
    "however , to estimate the `` target '' scale at which the fluctuations would need to be measured in order to be useful as a lensing correction , we make the ( unrealistically optimistic ) simplifying assumption that the matter fluctuations above a certain length scale , and the corresponding contribution to lensing magnification , have been perfectly determined",
    ". the fluctuations on smaller scales , with @xmath144 , then determine the only remaining weak - lensing uncertainty .",
    "therefore , we truncate the integral over the wavenumber ( see eq .",
    "[ 1 ] in @xcite ) at @xmath141 .",
    "the resulting fractional improvement in @xmath145 ( which equals @xmath146 ) is plotted in figure  [ fig : wlkmin ] .",
    "the improvement is about 8% , 20% , and 40% for @xmath147 , 3 , and @xmath148 ,",
    "respectively - i.e. , about half of the weak lensing uncertainty is from length  scales @xmath149 mpc .",
    "the lyman @xmath142 transmission spectra of sdss quasars have been used to determine the power spectrum down to scales of @xmath150 , implying that the spectral resolution would need to be improved by a factor of @xmath25 to allow significant improvements .    the uncorrected weak - lensing redshift uncertainty @xmath151 is shown in figure  [ fig : dz ] .",
    "the plot clearly shows that weak lensing errors typically exceed 1% and dominate the other redshift errors for @xmath152 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : dz ] , we compare the contributions from four different sources of redshift errors : @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 for smbh masses @xmath157 .",
    "weak lensing errors are dominant for @xmath158 .",
    "redshift error is shown for both scalings @xmath159 ( labeled  _ lisa_a  ) and @xmath160 ( labelled  _ lisa_b  ) .",
    "these curves separate for @xmath161 , when the maximum observation time @xmath59 decreases under @xmath162  yr .",
    "the other three sources of errors are within a factor of two of one another at @xmath3 , for typical _ lisa _ sources and peculiar velocities .",
    "the total redshift uncertainty then follows from summing the uncertainties in quadrature ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : delta_z ] ] ) .",
    "the result for @xmath163 and @xmath3 is @xmath164 , 2.59% , and 3.03% in the cases we labeled as best , typical , and worst , respectively .",
    "note that we have not explicitly added an error due to the instrumental resolution of a spectrograph , because this is often much better than this value ( e.g. for sdss , the redshift resolution is between @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) .",
    "we next use these redshift uncertainties to derive the three  dimensional error volume , @xmath167 , in which the em counterparts need to be identified .",
    "the comoving volume corresponding to the above redshift uncertainties , combined with the solid  angle uncertainty @xmath168 , is @xmath169 substituting the solid  angle errors from table  [ tab : lisa ] , we find @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 for the same three cases",
    ".    equation  ( [ eq : dv ] ) should be regarded as a simple estimate of the volume that needs to be searched .",
    "the 2d uncertainty @xmath168 was obtained by a fisher analysis , and represents the solid area of a 2d error ellipse .",
    "this equation then gives the volume of a cylinder with a height of @xmath173 .",
    "the arguably more appropriate volume of an ellipsoid whose third semi ",
    "axis is @xmath174 would be a factor of 4/3 larger . on the other hand , equation  ( [ eq : dv ] )",
    "also naively assumes that @xmath91 and @xmath49 are uncorrelated ",
    "i.e. , it describes an error ellipsoid whose @xmath17 axis is oriented along the line of sight .",
    "the angular position is estimated by _",

    "however , the luminosity distance estimate from _ lisa _ itself is strongly correlated with its angular positioning @xcite , which results in an error ellipse that is tilted relative to the line of sight , and has a smaller overall volume than the simple orthogonal product in equation  ( [ eq : dv ] ) would imply .",
    "we have utilized the correlation matrices for the _ lisa _ distance and angle estimates given in table 1 and 2 of @xcite for @xmath175 at @xmath3 and @xmath176 at @xmath177 , to estimate the reduction in the total error volume due to these correlations .",
    "note that this analysis applies only to the _ lisa _ uncertainties . among the 11 free parameters in @xcite ,",

    "if _ lisa _ errors dominated the total redshift uncertainty @xmath186 , this implies that the correlations could reduce the mean number of counterparts by a factor of 34 .",

    "to estimate the typical number of quasar counterparts to a specific smbh merger event , we combine the size , @xmath188 , of the comoving _",

    "the bottom panel shows results for the more conservative scaling of _ lisa _ errors , @xmath252 and @xmath253 if @xmath254 . in all cases at @xmath5",
    ", a unique counterpart may be identifiable .",
    "one may also interpret the number of counterparts we compute , @xmath255 , together with the same simple criterion @xmath256 , in a somewhat different way : as a means to _ test _ our hypothesis that _",
    "events are accompanied by bright quasar activity .",
    "if our hypothesis is incorrect , then the number of quasars in _ lisa _ s error volume should be drawn from the random distribution of quasars on the sky , unrelated to the _ lisa _ event ( excluding the correction due to correlations that we have included in our analysis ; although we found this correction to be relatively insignificant ) . in many configurations ,",
    "we find @xmath257 , implying a significant probability that _ no _ bright quasars would be found in _",
    "_ s error volume in these cases . if several",
    "events are indeed found with no such quasar counterparts , it would , by itself , be an important new constraint on the process of binary black hole coalescence .",
    "the identification of counterparts could be aided by a combined analysis of several gw events .",
    "every successful identification yields a very precise direct measurement for the @xmath12 eddington ratio .",

    "if cosmological uncertainties were to dominate the error budget on a counterpart s redshift , a combined analysis could further improve the robustness of the identification . indeed ,",
    "even if each gw event has , by itself , several possible counterparts , each of these counterparts would require a different set of cosmological parameters . as a result",
    ", there should be , in general , only a single set of cosmological parameters around the fiducial cosmological parameters .",
    "] that gives a consistent set of counterparts to all of the gw events @xcite .",
    "the counterpart candidates contradicting this concordant set can be discarded .",
    "unfortunately , the error budget is likely to be dominated by the lensing magnification uncertainty .",
    "in this case , having multiple events is going to be helpful only if a sufficient number ( @xmath259 ) of events are detected to map out the full distribution of magnifications ( such a large number of events is not expected ; see below ) .",
    "different strategies for the search of an electromagnetic counterpart to a _",
    "lisa _ event can be envisioned .",
    "the simplest one would be to search , in an existing survey catalog , for candidates located in the 3d _ lisa _ error box .",
    "we list the characteristics of several deep present and near - future surveys in table  [ tab : surveys ] .",
    "these surveys cover various bands between 400 and 1100 nm . in each case",
    ", we calculate the minimum mass of the quasar corresponding to the magnitude limit of the survey , provided that the quasar is shining at the eddington luminosity . for the quasar spectrum we use @xcite and follow @xcite to account for the lyman series line blanketing and photoelectric hi absorption to obtain the apparent luminosity .",
    "the portion of the sky covered and scheduled operation times are also given .",
    "the most promising ( deepest and largest sky coverage ) among the planned surveys is that from the lsst , scheduled for the same time as _",
    "lisa_.    a second strategy would be to design a survey specifically aimed at identifying the counterparts of well  localized _ lisa _ events , by observing in detail the 2d angular error box provided by _",
    "lisa _ and looking for the expected counterparts .",
    "the time domain may come to play an important role in the strategy of this type of surveys .",
    "indeed , for some of the events , one may have , from the _ lisa _ data - stream , a reasonably good idea of the location on the sky of the smbh binary prior to coalescence .",
    "for instance , @xcite estimate that this knowledge may be available with reasonable accuracy about a day in advance .",
    "one would then be able to monitor any unusual photometric variability associated with the violent smbh merger in this area somewhat before , during and after the coalescence . surveying the area long ( i.e. months or years ) after the coalescence may also prove useful in discovering the counterpart and/or monitoring the viscous evolution of any gas surrounding the smbh merger remnant @xcite .",
    "the time domain may thus greatly facilitate the identification of a unique electromagnetic counterpart to some _ lisa _ events , even in cases when many counterpart candidates otherwise exist in the 3d error box .      throughout the analysis of _ lisa _ uncertainties , we focused on equal mass binaries . with this simplifying assumption , it was possible to derive approximate scalings as a function of total mass and relate them to the calculations of @xcite for @xmath260 .",
    "we also find good agreement with the recent calculations of @xcite for a variety of equal - mass combinations . for unequal masses ,",
    "the gw signal - power depends to leading order on the simple combination @xmath261 , allowing a straightforward extension of our scaling arguments to more general mass ratios .    as mentioned above , our results depend on the _ lisa _ sensitivity curve at low frequencies .",
    "in particular , the relationship between the arrival frequency @xmath262 , the final frequency @xmath57 , and the _ lisa _ minimum frequency noise wall @xmath263 determines the maximum possible observation time for the in - spiral . the exact value of @xmath263 is currently assumed to lie between 0.1 and 0.03mhz .",
    "figure  [ fig : cp1 ] assumes @xmath264 . in this case , at @xmath3 , a @xmath265 observation of the in - spiral phase is possible for @xmath266 but for larger masses , the maximum possible observation time becomes shorter than a year .",
    "we have also computed the number of quasars in the 3d _ lisa _ error box for the higher value of @xmath267 .",
    "we find a significant increase in this number at the high  mass end ( i.e. for @xmath268 ) , but the results are essentially unaffected for lower mass smbhs .",
    "an important assumption in our analysis is the near - eddington luminosity of the quasar counterparts associated with _",
    "lisa _ events .",
    "while this assumption is difficult to justify from first principles , it is the luminosity expected if smbh accretion occurs in a regime which is not supply - limited .",
    "observationally , the eddington ratio of quasars , @xmath12 , can be inferred , leading to values from 0.1 to @xmath14 , with higher values at large redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this ratio has been determined for a handful of lower mass smbhs in agns and these sources have been found to cluster around @xmath269 as well @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite and @xcite both suggest @xmath12 is typically around 1/3 .",
    "the restricted luminosity range @xmath250 assumed in our analysis effectively serves as a 4th ( `` brightness '' ) dimension , complementing the three - dimensional geometrical error volume provided by _",
    "lisa_. according to table  [ tab : lisa ] , for a given event , the mass estimate provided by _",
    "lisa _ is typically very accurate .",
    "therefore , it is through the range of acceptable eddington ratios that the integration bounds in equation  ( [ eq : number of cp ] ) change .",
    "since the luminosity function decreases rapidly with @xmath270 , the integral is dominated by the lower bound and is largely independent of @xmath193 .",
    "we chose @xmath271 for concreteness .",
    "when modifying the lower bound from @xmath194 to @xmath272 or @xmath273 , for instance , we find that the number of quasars present in the 3d _ lisa _ error box changes by a factor of 0.1 and 5 , respectively . for low @xmath270 .",
    "] obviously , our need to extrapolate the quasar luminosity function below the minimum value constrained by the observations is an additional important source of uncertainty in our analysis , but one that will be addressed well by future generations of surveys ( table  [ tab : surveys ] ) .    in a recent study ,",
    "@xcite have found a large number of small  separation quasars , implying an order - of - magnitude increase in the quasar auto - correlation on scales @xmath274 kpc .",
    "however , the dimensions of the error volume as we estimated it is generally much larger ( @xmath275 mpc even in our best case ) . as a result ,",
    "the average number of counterparts is changed by a negligible factor by this small  scale auto - correlation : @xmath276 , @xmath277 , and @xmath278 in the best , typical , and worst case _ lisa _ errors .",
    "increasing the correlation by an order of magnitude out to a scale of @xmath279 kpc would still cause at most a 6% increase in the mean number of quasars in the best case .",
    "@xcite do not find an increase in the correlation beyond @xmath280 kpc scales .",
    "we note that our inability to identify the correct counterpart from among any rare ultra - small - separation candidates would not degrade cosmological parameter estimations significantly .",
    "one may also argue that such close  separation binary quasars would better represent a precursor stage in the evolution of the two black holes towards an eventual coalescence .",
    "if so , one would not expect them to be associated with gw events , and they may in fact be anti  correlated with such events .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we have focused on optical quasars as plausible counterparts to gw events .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat our analysis using other types of `` electromagnetic objects '' that may be associated with smbh coalescences .",
    "for example , even if gas accretion leads to prodigious energy output in radiation , the optical light of the quasar may be obscured by the intervening gas and dust near the galactic nucleus . in these cases",
    ", the gw events may be more commonly associated with x  ray quasars ( e.g. @xcite ) , or with ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) . as these sources are also relatively rare , unique counterparts may be identifiable if such objects typically accompany gw events .      a successful identification of a quasar counterpart to a _",
    "lisa _ event would provide powerful diagnostics on the physics of smbh gaseous accretion and the associated radiation .",
    "the masses and spins of the two bhs before merger can be directly determined from the gw signal , from which the mass and spin of the remnant bh follows at some precision . in some cases ( e.g. hughes & menou 2005 )",
    ", the remnant bh could also be observed by _",
    "lisa _ during the post - merger ring - down phase , which would constrain its mass and spin directly .",
    "the orientation of the orbital plane of the bh binary before merger would be measured as well .",
    "all of these parameters are generally unknown for quasars detected only via traditional electromagnetic techniques .",
    "the observation and monitoring of quasar counterparts to _ lisa _ events may thus offer us some of the best laboratories for the study of agn physics .",
    "first , the eddington ratio can be measured to high accuracy ( limited only by photometric errors and bolometric corrections ) , since _ lisa _ estimates for the bh masses are extremely precise by astronomical standards ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : lisa ] ) .",
    "second , if the quasar accretes at or near the eddington limit , given its eddington ratio , one may be able to set a useful lower limit on the radiative efficiency of its accretion flow .",
    "if it is in excess of the canonical @xmath281% value , it will provide an interesting empirical test of the physics of accretion onto a spinning bh , with a spin directly constrained by the gw measurement .",
    "third , the counterpart could be monitored for years following the merger to follow the viscous evolution of the gaseous disk and thus clarify its role in the smbh coalescence process .",
    "fourth , it is expected that the gas disk will be forced in the orbital plane of the pre - merger binary by the bardeen - peterson effect @xcite . knowing the disk orientation could thus offer tests of the geometry of quasar emission and obscuration ( even after the merger , given the expected spin of the remnant ) .",
    "it may also be possible to further develop diagnostics related to the geometry of a jet , if present .",
    "the successful identification of an em counterpart to a gw event could , in principle , open the way to use them as `` standard sirens '' to probe the background cosmology @xcite , analogously to the ia sne standard candles @xcite .",
    "the precision on the cosmological model can , however , be improved only if the @xmath74 function is determined to a higher accuracy than it can be already guessed from other data that exists when _",
    "lisa _ is operational . as an example",
    ", we have assumed here to have available the uncertainty from the combined datasets from two future projects , _ planck _ and lsst .",
    "we have found that the major obstacle against a dramatic improvement on cosmology is the gravitational lensing of intervening matter along the line of sight to a _",
    "lisa _ source . in the weak - lensing limit , the r.m.s .",
    "magnification of a source at @xmath138 is @xmath282 , leading to a luminosity distance error of @xmath283 . @xcite",
    "have shown that galaxy shear maps can be used to correct weak - lensing distortion , but only a 20% relative improvement can be achieved , so that @xmath284 .",
    "we suggest alternatively that correcting for the contribution of the known distribution of intervening matter might improve weak lensing uncertainties by another 20% .",
    "furthermore , the weak lensing uncertainty can be overcome if a large sample of sources is available when fitting @xmath74 , mapping out the magnification distribution .",
    "using a number @xmath285 of merger events along with uniquely identified counterparts , the lensing error reduces approximately as @xmath286 ( although the actual improvement will be less pronounced , due to a non - gaussian tail of high magnifications ; @xcite ) . to reach the _ planck _",
    "+ lsst level of @xmath287 , we find that @xmath288 events would be required .",
    "is such a large number of merger events , with uniquely determined electromagnetic counterparts , expected from the _ lisa _ data - stream ?",
    "monte - carlo simulations of smbh merger trees generally indicate _",
    "event rates from @xmath289@xmath290 for masses @xmath291 at @xmath5 @xcite . detecting a total of @xmath292 would be barely possible during a 3-year _ lisa _ mission lifetime , only allowing a marginal test of the concordance of cosmological parameters with standard sirens .",
    "in addition , most of these events may be expected to involve smbhs at the low  mass end ( i.e. @xmath293 ; @xcite ) , which are not ideal for unique counterpart identifications ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cp1 ] ) .",
    "however , large uncertainties remain on the expected event rate . for example , @xcite predict much larger rates , which could open up the possibility of a statistical analysis , folding in the expected weak lensing magnification distribution .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the possibility that smbh - smbh mergers , detected as gravitational wave sources by _ lisa _ , are accompanied by gas accretion and quasar activity with a luminosity approaching the eddington limit . under this assumption ,",
    "we have computed the number of quasar counterparts that would be found in the three  dimensional error volume provided by _",

    "we found that weak lensing errors exceed other sources of uncertainties on the inferred redshift of the electromagnetic counterpart and increase the effective error volume by nearly an order of magnitude .",
