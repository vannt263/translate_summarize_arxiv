    "the fundamental interactions of quarks and gluons , especially these with large momentum transfer , studied in lepton - hadron and hadron - hadron collisions , are successfully described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "a challenge for this theory is the description of larger and more complex systems , necessary for understanding the properties of the matter created in the early stage of the big bang .",
    "conditions similar to that in the early stage of the universe are created in the collisions of heavy nuclei in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory . in this accelerator the beams of heavy ions , up to au , can be accelerated to the momentum 100 gev / c per nucleon and collide with the highest energy available currently in the laboratory ( @xmath1 = 200 gev ) .",
    "the system created in the collision of two au nuclei reaches , after approximate equilibration at @xmath2 2  fm / c , the energy density of at least 3  gev/@xmath3 .",
    "this energy density is about 6 times larger than that of the proton under normal conditions @xcite .",
    "qcd based calculations using numerical techniques of lattice gauge theory suggest that under such conditions a different type of matter , quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , should appear .    in the following sections the properties and the evolution of the system created in the heavy nuclei collisions are described .",
    "the dependence on the centrality of the collision ( i.e. the geometrical overlap between nuclei in the plane transverse to their direction of flight ) represented by the number of binary collisions between nucleons , @xmath4 , and the number of nucleons participating in the collision , @xmath5 , is extensively studied .",
    "the early prediction for the hot and dense nuclear matter suggested weak interactions between partons and creation of a gas of quarks and gluons , but experimental results did not confirm these expectations @xcite .",
    "the first evidence of strong interactions between partons came from the observation of high-@xmath0 particles , which originate from jets created in relatively rare hard collisions of quarks or gluons .",
    "a proper measure of the relative yields of such particles is the nuclear modification factor : + @xmath6 + which normalizes production in @xmath7 collisions by elementary @xmath8 yields and accounts for increased probability of hard processes by dividing by @xmath4 .          in the absence of any nuclear effects @xmath9=1 , and",
    "this value is obtained for large @xmath0 in @xmath10 collisions @xcite , where no such effects are expected . in the most central @xmath11 collisions",
    "@xmath9 drops below 0.4 for @xmath12  3  gev / c ( fig .  [ figraa ] ) .",
    "this effect is explained by strong interactions in the medium causing that only partons produced near the surface and emitted in the outside direction do not lose their momentum and can fragment into high-@xmath0 particle(s ) . for smaller systems like @xmath13 or for less central @xmath11 collisions",
    "the suppression is also present , but its magnitude is smaller @xcite .",
    "large acceptance of the phobos detector allows to study the effects of parton absorption in the sqgp .",
    "recently , we have measured in @xmath11 collisions the correlation between a high-@xmath0 trigger particle ( @xmath12  2.5  gev / c ) with the remaining particles @xcite .",
    "it is known that in the elementary @xmath8 interactions such high-@xmath0 particle is accompanied by close partners , but correlated particles are also present at opposite azimuthal angles . in the case of @xmath11 collisions production of correlated particles is enhanced ( fig .  [ figtrighist ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the elementary interactions the correlation in the `` near side '' is present also at large distances in pseudorapidity , @xmath14  2 , which may be related to the longitudinal expansion of the system .",
    "equally interesting is the study of very low-@xmath0 particles production .",
    "theory predicted strong increase of their yields in the case of quark - gluon gas creation .",
    "the phobos experiment is capable to register and identify charged particles with very low momenta , starting from @xmath0=  30  mev / c .",
    "measured yields ( fig .",
    "[ figlowpt ] ) do not show any significant enhancement , they agree with the extrapolations of the fits ( performed in the higher @xmath0 range ) of the models assuming expansion of the system , for more details see @xcite .",
    "as it was already shown before , the system created in the @xmath7 collision is expanding .",
    "more detailed information on the system evolution is obtained in the study of the collective elliptic flow .",
    "the elongated shape of the overlap area of the nuclei is reflected in the anisotropy in azimuth of the particle momenta distribution and measured as the second coefficient , @xmath15 , in the fourier expansion of @xmath16 distribution ( relative to the reaction plane , which is defined by the direction of the beam and the impact parameter vector ) @xcite .",
    "as expected , largest flow is observed in peripheral collisions and decreases with centrality ( fig .",
    "[ figv2npart ] ) . for comparison of the flow with collision geometry the eccentricity , @xmath17 , of the interaction area was used .",
    "the phobos experiment has proposed to introduce participant eccentricity @xcite , @xmath18 , basing on positions of nucleons taking part in the collision ( as obtained from glauber monte carlo simulations ) .",
    "this definition accounts for the fact that the axis of the interaction area defined by the nucleons usually is rotated with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "dividing of @xmath15 for @xmath11 and @xmath13 collisions by eccentricity allows to obtain a universal dependence on @xmath5 only if @xmath19 is used ( fig .",
    "[ figv2ecc ] ) .",
    "one step further goes the analysis of the elliptic flow fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the relative @xmath15 fluctuations measured by phobos are large , they exceed 30% .",
    "the comparison with the fluctuations of participant eccentricity presented in fig .",
    "[ figv2fluct ] shows that the fluctuations present at the very beginning of collisions are not significantly modified during the expansion of the system .",
    "= 5.6 cm = 5.6 cm    details of the expansion of the system and it s hadronization determine also two - particle correlations , which are measured by phobos in the full azimuthal angle and a wide pseudorapidity range , @xmath20  3 .",
    "earlier study of forward - backward multiplicity correlations has already shown strong short - range correlations , not explained by the models of @xmath7 collisions @xcite .",
    "they can be interpreted and parameterized by a cluster model @xcite , which assumes that the particles are produced in two steps : first some unstable objects , clusters , are produced , later they decay into observed particles . using the correlation functions obtained from the experimental data two basic parameters of the clusters can be extracted @xcite : @xmath21 - the effective number of particles forming a cluster and @xmath22 - the width of the 2-particle correlation in @xmath23 which is directly connected with the cluster width .",
    "the values of these parameters obtained for @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath11 collisions are presented in fig .",
    "[ figkeffdelta ] .",
    "width of the clusters in the @xmath7 collisions seems to be larger than for @xmath8 .",
    "the cluster size , @xmath21 , decreases with centrality of @xmath7 collision .",
    "the values of @xmath21 are large , especially as they were not corrected for acceptance effects ( which would increase them ) and that the neutral particles , which are not detected , belonging to the clusters are not counted .",
    "interestingly , the centrality dependence for @xmath11 and @xmath13 becomes almost identical if events with similar shapes of nuclei overlap area are compared @xcite .",
    "in the collisions of heavy nuclei at very high energies extremely high energy density is reached and a new phase of matter , sqgp , is created @xcite .",
    "strong interactions in the quark - gluon matter are visible as the suppression of high-@xmath0 particles , the lack of enhancement in low-@xmath0 particles production and the presence of collective effects leading to elliptic flow .",
    "the yields of low-@xmath0 particles and the elliptic flow are consistent with the assumption of expansion of the system , as predicted by hydrodynamic model for an almost perfect fluid .",
    "global observables in the collisions of nuclei , not discussed in this paper , reveal unexpected simple relations : scaling of multiplicity with @xmath5 and extended longitudinal scaling of @xmath24 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in the recent studies the phobos experiment measured correlations of associated particles with a high-@xmath0 trigger particle , which extend at least 4 units in pseudorapidity . such long range correlations may be a sign of longitudinal expansion of the system .",
    "new results on the yields of low-@xmath0 particles support the hypothesis of a radial component of such expansion .",
    "the shape of the interaction area , characterized by eccentricity @xmath19 , determines the value of elliptic flow , @xmath15 .",
    "fluctuations of elliptic flow are of the same size as the fluctuations of eccentricity at the very beginning of the collision .",
    "strong short range correlations are observed in the a+a collisions , large size of clusters can not be explained by low mass resonances .",
