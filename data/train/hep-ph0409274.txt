    "how is electroweak symmetry broken ?",
    "the most important theoretical clue we have is the hierarchy problem , the problem of understanding the smallness of the weak scale compared to much higher scales in physics such as the planck scale .",
    "perhaps the most elegant solution of the hierarchy problem is dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this is the idea that the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking is determined by a new strong interaction scale .",
    "this naturally explains the smallness of the electroweak scale , since the strong interaction scale is given in terms of uv quantities by _",
    "ew~_uv e^-g_c^2/g_uv^2 , where @xmath8 is the strength of the coupling in the uv and @xmath9 is the critical value where electroweak symmetry is broken . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the electroweak scale is naturally exponentially small compared to @xmath11 .",
    "this mechanism is already realized in nature in the strong interaction sector , explaining why the qcd scale is naturally small compared to higher scales .",
    "this paradigm for electroweak symmetry breaking makes the general prediction that the electroweak symmetry breaking sector is strongly coupled at the tev scale . within a few years",
    ", the lhc will definitively settle the fundamental question of whether electroweak symmetry breaking sector is weakly or strongly coupled .",
    "until the lhc turns on , we must rely on indirect constraints .",
    "dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking faces a number of potential difficulties .",
    "first , strong interactions at the tev scale can ruin the agreement of the standard model with precision electroweak data .",
    "however , if the physics that breaks electroweak symmetry is a strongly coupled theory with no large or small parameters , ` dimensional analysis ' ( nda ) gives an estimate for the peskin - takeuchi @xmath7 and @xmath12 parameters s_nda ~ , t_nda ~. for comparison , the value of the @xmath7 parameter from scaled - up qcd is @xcite s_qcd ~0.3 .",
    "these are rough estimates , and are comparable to the size of the current 95% confidence level bounds @xcite",
    ". these do not rule out models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the models that _ are _ ruled out ( without fine tuning ) are those containing a large number @xmath4 of degrees of freedom , in which @xmath13 .",
    "these include large ` technicolor ' or ` walking technicolor ' theories @xcite , and randall - sundrum ( rs ) models @xcite with gauge fields in the bulk @xcite , which are related to large-@xmath4 conformal theories ( cft s ) by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "another general problem with models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking is that flavor is generally not decoupled from the tev scale . in technicolor models , this is because the order parameter that breaks electroweak symmetry is a techni - fermion bilinear @xmath14 with mass dimension @xmath15 .",
    "the standard - model fermion masses therefore arise from 4-fermion operators connecting the standard model fermions with the technifermions @xcite .",
    "these operators have dimension 6 , and therefore become strong at low scales . in particular",
    "the top coupling becomes strong at a scale   _ t ~_ew()^1/2 ~5 , where @xmath16 is the scale where the electroweak symmetry breaking sector becomes strongly coupled .",
    "@xmath17 is the scale where flavor must be addressed in these models .",
    "the flavor problem is less severe in models of ` walking ' technicolor , in which it is assumed that the electroweak order parameter @xmath14 has a large anomalous dimension , and scales as an operator with dimension @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "walking technicolor theories are similar to a cft with a nearly marginal ( slightly relevant ) operator that runs slowly and becomes strong and breaks electroweak symmetry .",
    "analyses based on the truncated schwinger - dyson equations show that in asymptotically free theories , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the scale where the top coupling becomes strong is then raised for @xmath20 to   _ t _ ew ~10 .",
    "attempts to make realistic models based on strong top dynamics can be found in . in this paper",
    ", we will instead attempt to avoid strong flavor - dependent dynamics at low scales .",
    "a simple way to avoid the restriction @xmath19 is to assume that the theory is at an interacting conformal fixed point above the tev scale .",
    "this class of theories offers a solution of the hierarchy problem that is identical to asymptotically free theories such as technicolor .",
    "if the cft is coupled to a gauge theory that is asymptotically free , this gauge theory will become strong in the ir , causing the cft to flow away from its fixed point . , and we do not consider it here . ]",
    "the resulting non - perturbative dynamics can give rise to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "another possibility is that the cft contains a nearly marginal operator that becomes strong in the ir .",
    "these mechanisms are attractive because it generates an exponentially large hierarchy .",
    "another possible mechanism exists if the cft has a relevant operator that transforms nontrivially under a global symmetry , a discrete symmetry .",
    "the coefficient of this operator can then be naturally small , and can set the scale for the breaking of conformal and electroweak symmetry . in this mechanism ,",
    "the large hierarchy is put in by hand in the form of a small coefficient , but it is technically natural .    in a strong cft , flavor arises from couplings of the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a standard - model fermion and @xmath23 is a cft operator with quantum numbers of the higgs . in order to decouple flavor , we would like to have the scaling dimension @xmath24 of the operator @xmath23 as small as possible . in cft s , bound on the scaling dimension of a scalar operator",
    "is @xmath25 @xcite . in the limit @xmath26",
    ", the scalar operator behaves as a weakly - coupled scalar field , which is just the standard - model higgs .",
    "the theory is therefore fine - tuned and does not solve the hierarchy problem . however , for @xmath0 , with @xmath27 , the top quark becomes strongly coupled at the scale   _ t ~_ew ( ) ^1/. this scale is _ exponentially _",
    "large for small @xmath2 , and therefore we can plausibly have sufficiently large @xmath2 to avoid fine - tuning , while decoupling the flavor to high scales .",
    "how @xmath17 must be to avoid flavor - changing neutral currents depends on the nature of flavor violation at this scale .",
    "the most pessimistic case imaginable is that there are unsuppressed strong contributions to operators that contribute to @xmath28@xmath29 mixing at the scale @xmath17 .",
    "this requires @xmath30 , which is obtained for @xmath31 .",
    "if we assume some suppression of flavor violation for the lightest generation , we expect that the flavor scale can be significantly lower .",
    "for example , a single yukawa suppression of four - fermion operators contributing to @xmath28@xmath29 mixing lowers the flavor scale to @xmath32 , which requires @xmath33 .",
    "such values of @xmath2 are definitely plausible . for example , in f - theory constructions of ads@xmath34 duals , one finds scalar operators with dimension @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the possible application of non - supersymmetric cft s with low - dimension scalar operators to the electroweak hierarchy problem was also discussed in .",
    "the randall - sundrum model gives an explicit example of a 4d cft , and has been extensively discussed as a solution of the hierarchy problem . in this model , the higgs is usually localized in the the ir brane to obtain a large hierarchy . in this case the higgs field can be thought of as a bulk field with a large mass , and in the corresponding 4d interpretation the electroweak order parameter has a large ( @xmath37 ) scaling dimension . to obtain sufficiently large fermion masses ,",
    "the fermions are put on the ir brane or in the bulk @xcite . in 4d language",
    ", this corresponds to generating fermion masses by making them mix with composite fermions so that they can feel the symmetry breaking in the strong sector .",
    "the mixing of the standard - model fermions with composite fermions was considered previously in the context of qcd - like technicolor @xcite .",
    "theories of this type are interesting alternatives to our scenario . as we discuss in the appendix",
    ", these theories generally have a potentially viable region of the parameter space where @xmath38 is just at the current experimental bound while corrections to @xmath39 require fine - tuning at the @xmath40 level @xcite .",
    "however , we will pursue scenarios where the standard - model fermions are completely elementary , just like in conventinal technicolor theories .",
    "it is a simple matter to modify the rs model to give the electroweak order parameter a smaller dimension : one simply puts a higgs scalar in the bulk , and leaves the fermions on the uv brane .",
    "electroweak symmetry is broken by a higgs potential localized on the ir brane ( ensuring that this is an ir effect ) and the bulk higgs field communicates electroweak symmetry breaking to the fermions on the uv brane .",
    "taking the higgs bulk mass parameter to be negative makes the dimension of the higgs operator in the 4d cft description smaller .",
    "however , we will show that scalar operators with @xmath5 are fine - tuned in rs .",
    "this can be traced to the fact that rs is a large-@xmath4 theory , and this fine - tuning is common to all large-@xmath4 theories .",
    "we are therefore led to a rather dark corner of theory space : non - supersymmetric 4d strongly - coupled conformal field theories with small @xmath4 .",
    "these can have a scalar operator with dimension @xmath41 with @xmath42 , and can dynamically break electroweak symmetry at the tev scale while giving large fermion masses without flavor - changing neutral currents .",
    "small-@xmath4 theories also have an acceptably small @xmath7 parameter .",
    "not much is known about the dynamics of such theories , and so our discussion of these theories is necessarily speculative . above the tev scale , the theory becomes conformally invariant , and the new strong conformal dynamics can be directly tested in direct analogy with the way qcd is tested at a high - energy @xmath43 collider . however , even the lhc will be limited to exploring the lightest ` hadrons ' of the cft , and it is not possible to make rigorous predictions for this regime . in the case where @xmath2 arises from a ( moderately ) small parameter in the fundamental theory , we argue that the theory contains a prominent scalar resonance near ( but somewhat below ) the tev scale , with couplings similar to those of a heavy standard - model higgs , but deviating from the standard - model couplings by order @xmath2 .",
    "this provides an interesting and well - motivated signal to look for at the lhc , whose observation would clearly motivate going to even higher energies in the future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the constraints on the operator dimension @xmath24 in various types of known models and argue that small-@xmath4 theories avoid all constraints and can have @xmath5 without fine tuning . in section 3 , we study the phenomenology of these theories , focusing mainly on the possibility of a higgs - like scalar resonance .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , an important question for models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking based on conformal field theory is the scaling dimension @xmath24 of the ` higgs ' operator @xmath23 that acts as the electroweak order parameter . in order to decouple flavor , we would like to have @xmath24 as small as possible , while avoiding fine - tuning . in this section",
    "we review what is known about low - dimension scalar operators , and argue that theories with strong coupling and small @xmath4 can give operators with @xmath5 without fine tuning .",
    "general theorems of conformal field theory tell us that a scalar operator @xmath23 must have dimension @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an operator with dimension @xmath46 is a free field ( meaning that correlation functions of @xmath23 are the same as those of a free field ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that for @xmath24 sufficiently close to 1 , the theory is equivalent to a cft weakly coupled to a higgs field , which clearly does not solve the hierarchy problem . in cft language",
    ", this is because the operator @xmath47 has dimension close to @xmath48 , which is relevant for @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of a relevant operator that can not be forbidden by symmetries means that the fixed point is not reached unless the coefficient of the relevant operator is tuned .",
    "this argument seems to suggest that the theory is fine - tuned for any @xmath5 , but it is limited to weak coupling because we have assumed that the dimension of @xmath47 is approximately @xmath48 . since the anomalous dimension @xmath49 is of order a one - loop factor , we expect the anomalous dimension of @xmath47 to also be of order @xmath50 for a weakly - coupled theory with @xmath51 .",
    "but for strong coupling the operator @xmath47 will have a large anomalous dimension , and its dimension will not have any simple relation to the dimension of @xmath23 . ''",
    "has no _ a priori _ meaning .",
    "the remarks above apply if we define @xmath47 to be the operator of lowest scaling dimension in the operator product expansion of @xmath52 other than the unit operator . ]",
    "exceptions to this are large-@xmath4 theories , as we will discuss below .",
    "how small can we take @xmath53 ?",
    "in a nearly free theory with an elementary scalar , @xmath2 is an anomalous dimension , which is of order a loop - counting factor in the theory . in other words ,",
    "perturbation theory is an expansion in powers of @xmath2 , and we expect it to break down when @xmath54 . for values like @xmath55 , perturbation theory is no longer a reliable guide . in these theories , it is possible that the operator @xmath47 has a sufficiently large anomalous dimension to make it an irrelevant operator . we conclude that the general theorem does not imply that theories with @xmath56 are fine - tuned .",
    "we now consider large-@xmath4 cft s . in large-@xmath4 theories ,",
    "the matrix elements of operators factorize , and we can conclude that the operator @xmath47 has dimension near @xmath48 ( up to @xmath57 corrections ) even if the theory is strongly coupled . this is true even for theories with a large t hooft parameter , such as the 4d dual of the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model , as we will discuss below .",
    "the operator @xmath47 is therefore relevant for all @xmath5 , and we conclude that large-@xmath4 cft s with scalar operators with @xmath5 are fine - tuned .",
    "large-@xmath4 theories are also disfavored as a dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking sector because they give contributions to the @xmath7 parameter that grow with @xmath4 . in theories with a small t hooft parameter , this is simply because @xmath7 arises from a vacuum polarization effects that count the number of microscopic states .",
    "we will see that rs models , which have a large t hooft parameter , also predict large @xmath7 in the absence of fine - tuning .    for these reasons",
    ", we are led to consider theories that do not have large @xmath4 , and which can not be obtained from rs setup .",
    "@xmath58 gauge theories with @xmath59 flavors of dirac fermions loses asymptotic freedom for @xmath60 , and for @xmath61 with @xmath62 the theory has a weakly coupled ` banks - zaks ' fixed point @xcite .",
    "this allows us to infer the existence of qcd - like theories that flow to strongly coupled cft s in the ir .",
    "the loop expansion parameter at the banks - zaks fixed point is @xmath63 , so we know there is a conformal window for a range of @xmath63 .",
    "the conformal window ends at some value @xmath64 , and the cft s at this end of the conformal window are necessarily strongly coupled .",
    "although this argument is strictly speaking limited to large @xmath4 ( where @xmath63 can be thought of as a continuous parameter ) , it is very reasonable to assume that there are also small-@xmath4 asymptotically free gauge theories that flow to strong conformal fixed points .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether theories of this kind can give rise to a conformal sector with scalar operators with @xmath5 . to obtain a tractable approximation to the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd - like theories , it is traditional to truncate the schwinger - dyson equations by replacing the full gauge propagator and gauge - fermion vertices by their tree - level values in the landau gauge , giving rise to the so - called ` gap equation . '",
    "however , this limits the parameterization of the non - perturbative effects to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking via a dynamically generated ` constituent quark mass . ' in particular , it is not able to describe the conformal fixed point dynamics of the banks - zaks fixed point .",
    "the conformal window was studied using the gap equation in , which concluded that the conformal window in qcd ends at @xmath65 .",
    "it would be very interesting to further explore non - perturbative approximations to qcd - like theories that can capture the physics of the perturbative end of the conformal window and model the non - perturbative dynamics at the strong end of the conformal window .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we now consider the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model , which gives us a concrete , calculable cft .",
    "to make the connection to conformal field theory as transparent as possible , it is convenient to write the 5d ads metric as ds^2 = ^2 _ dx^dx^- , where @xmath66 is the ads curvature , and @xmath67 parameterizes the extra dimension .",
    "the fact that this metric is invariant under the transformation , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , naturally leads to the interpretation that the parameter @xmath70 is proportional to the energy scale in the corresponding 4d cft .",
    "we assume that all dimensionful quantities in the 5d lagrangian are @xmath71 in units of @xmath66 .",
    "the physical size of dimensionful couplings at a position @xmath70 in the bulk is then given by @xmath72 .",
    "for simplicity , we will use units where @xmath73 .",
    "we consider a 5d complex scalar doublet @xmath74 with bulk mass @xmath75",
    ". we will be interested in the situation where @xmath74 gets a vev , breaking an @xmath76 gauge symmetry . in this section for simplicity .",
    "we will also ignore an @xmath77 gauge symmetry we need to put in the bulk for any realistic model to guarantee a custodial @xmath78 symmetry in the 4d cft .",
    "adding these complications is straightforward and does not alter our conclusions . ]",
    "it is therefore convenient to parameterize the field by h = e^i_a _ a (    c 0 +    ) , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) are real fields . when @xmath79 gets a vev , the zero mode of @xmath80 parameterizes the goldstone degrees of freedom . in this section ,",
    "we are interested in the effects of the vev , and so we will mainly concentrate on the field @xmath79 . solving the equation of motion in the bulk ,",
    "we obtain the most general 4d poincare invariant solution : = a ^n - 4 + b ^-n where @xmath82 .",
    "we restrict attention to masses satisfying the breitenlohner - freedman bound @xmath83 @xcite , so that @xmath84 . for the special case @xmath85 ,",
    "the general solution is = ^-2 + ^-2 .",
    "we will focus on the generic case below .",
    "we now discuss the cft interpretation of the solution for @xmath86 . according the the ads / cft correspondence , the field @xmath79",
    "is associated with an operator @xmath23 of the 4d cft . as we will review below , in the conventional case the operator @xmath23 has dimension @xmath87 , which implies @xmath19 . to obtain a 4d cft with @xmath5 , we must change the uv boundary condition @xcite . specifically",
    ", we must choose the uv boundary condition to set @xmath88 , so that the ir boundary condition determines @xmath89 .",
    "this can be done by adding a uv boundary lagrangian _",
    "uv = -m |h|^2 = -m ^2 .",
    "the uv boundary condition is then _ uv & = 0 , + .",
    "|_uv & = 0 , which gives ( n - 4 + m ) a _ uv^n - 4 = ( n - m ) b _ uv^-n . the generic solution is @xmath90 , but we can tune @xmath88 by taking m = 4 - n. note that we are tuning a relevant operator that can not be forbidden by symmetries .",
    "we now specify the ir boundary conditions .",
    "we assume that the ir boundary conditions set .",
    "|_ir & = , + .",
    "|_ir & = 0 .",
    "this can be viewed as the result of adding an @xmath78 invariant ir potential of the form v_ir = ( |h|^2 - ^2)^2 and taking the limit @xmath91 so that the radial component of the field is frozen .",
    "( note that the boundary conditions and ensure that the fields @xmath80 each have a massless goldstone zero mode . )",
    "the results for the coefficients @xmath92 and @xmath89 are then b =    _ ir^n &  ` generic ' 0 &  tuned    and a =    b _ uv^4 - 2n &  ` generic ' _",
    "ir^4 - n &  tuned    now suppose that the vev for the field @xmath79 spontaneously breaks an @xmath78 gauge symmetry in the bulk and generates a mass for a fermion localized on the uv brane .",
    "this is the rs description of breaking the gauge symmetry by the vev of the operator @xmath23 and giving mass to an elementary fermion coupling to @xmath23 .",
    "the 4d gauge boson mass is m_w^2 & = _ _ ir^_uv d ^2 + & =    _ ir^2 &  ` generic ' _ ir^2 &  tuned    where @xmath93 is the gauge coupling of the 4d gauge zero mode . in the tuned case with @xmath94 ,",
    "the gauge boson mass grows large as @xmath95 increases , so @xmath96 is sensitive to the uv scale .",
    "the physical interpretation of this case is that the gauge symmetry is broken in the uv , not in the ir .",
    "this means that this case does _ not _ describe dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , we will restrict to @xmath97 in the rest of the paper .",
    "however , note that even if @xmath97 , taking the @xmath98 limit in the tuned case leads to m_w^2 12 g_4 ^ 2 ^ 2_ir^2 ( _ uv / _ ir ) , so the gauge boson mass is logarithmically sensitive to the uv .",
    "we will discuss the 4d interpretation of the logarithm shortly .",
    "now consider fermions , a doublet @xmath99 and a singlet @xmath100 localized on the uv brane .",
    "we add the uv boundary term _",
    "uv = _ uv^-1 - , where the factor @xmath101 multiplying the kinetic term arises from the conformal factor in the metric .",
    "the fermion mass is therefore m_t & = y_t _ uv _ uv + & =    y_t _ ir ( _ ir / _ uv ) ^n - 1 &  ` generic ' y_t _ ir ( _ ir / _ uv )",

    "this is easy to understand .",
    "the effective lagrangian at the ir scale has the form _",
    "eff = z |d_h|^2 - v(h ) + , where @xmath104 is the lightest kk mode of the scalar .",
    "the logarithm in reflects the fact that the wavefunction factor @xmath105 depends logarithmically on the uv scale , because in the @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) limit @xmath104 is just a weakly - coupled scalar .",
    "( note that @xmath108 and @xmath109 are quantities defined at the ir scale . )",
    "there is no logarithm in @xmath110 as @xmath98 because the fermion yukawa coupling is not renormalized ( apart from the wavefunction renormalization in @xmath105 ) within our approximation of treating @xmath111 as a background field .",
    "we therefore conclude that the tuned case can indeed describe operators with dimension @xmath44 .",
    "now we study how much fine tuning is actually necessary to reach the tuned case .",
    "if we deviate from the fine - tuning condition by @xmath112 , the coefficient @xmath92 now has to be non - zero to satisfy the uv boundary condition : b ~ m _ ir^n ( ) ^2n-4 .",
    "the condition that this is a small correction at the ir brane requires @xmath113 , ( ) ^4 - 2d 1 , where we have used @xmath114 .",
    "this quantifies the amount of the fine - tuning .",
    "note that for @xmath115 we have the same tuning as in the standard model . of course , we need only something like @xmath116 to push the flavor scale up to @xmath117  tev , but even in this case the fine - tuning is @xmath118 , which is unacceptable .",
    "the 4d cft interpretation of this fine - tuning is easy to understand .",
    "since the cft contains an operator @xmath119 , it also contains the operator @xmath120 which is invariant under all symmetries .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence relates operator products to multi - particle states , and the dimensions of composite operators factorize essentially as a consequence of the factorization properties of multi - particle states in a weakly - coupled 5d field theory .",
    "the dimension of the operator @xmath120 is therefore @xmath48 , which means it is a _ relevant _ operator .",
    "note that is exactly the amount of fine - tuning required to suppress the effects of a relevant operator of dimension @xmath48 .",
    "a convincing check of this interpretation of the fine - tuning can be obtained by computing the vacuum energy in the presence of the vev as a function of the tuning parameter @xmath121 .",
    "the bulk action integral vanishes thanks to the bulk equation of motion , leaving only the boundary terms .",
    "since the uv boundary condition is chosen to cancel the boundary term at the uv brane , we only get the contribution from the ir boundary : v(_ir ) & ~^5 .",
    "|_ir + & ~_ir^4 .",
    "on the other hand , in the 4d cft language , we are adding the operator _",
    "uv = _ uv ^ in the uv .",
    "if the dimension of @xmath120 is @xmath122 , then the coupling @xmath123 should scale with energy as ( ) = _ uv ( ) ^d-4 .",
    "the vacuum energy associated with @xmath124 therefore has the form v & ~_ir^4 + & ~_ir^4 . comparing this with",
    ", we see that @xmath122 is indeed equal to @xmath48 and that the tuning @xmath125 precisely corresponds to setting @xmath126 .",
    "note that this is a tree - level calculation on the ads side , which corresponds to a calculation at the leading order in the @xmath57 expansion on the cft side .",
    "loop corrections correspond to @xmath57 corrections , and are expected to give corrections to the relation @xmath127 .",
    "these corrections are suppressed by at least a loop factor , and are small whenever perturbation theory is under control .",
    "they therefore can not be used to make the rs model with @xmath5 natural , but it does illustrate that the relation @xmath127 is not exact in general .",
    "we will have more to say about the 4d interpretation of the rs model with @xmath5 in subsection [ subsec : lightscalarrs ] below .",
    "we showed above that @xmath5 requires tuning in the rs setup , but argued that this is because these are large-@xmath4 cft s .",
    "but there is another problem with large-@xmath4 theories .",
    "the fact that rs theories are large-@xmath4 theories means that we also expect them to give large contributions to the @xmath7 parameter .",
    "however , because the 4d cft corresponding to an rs model also has large t hooft parameter , we can not use nda to estimate @xmath7 .",
    "we therefore briefly review the size of @xmath7 in these theories .",
    "complete results with numerical coefficients can be found in .",
    "contributions to @xmath7 can arise in various ways , but here let us focus on the bulk contribution to @xmath7 arising from the mixing between the unperturbed gauge zero mode and the bulk kk modes via the higgs kinetic term @xcite .",
    "this is not necessarily the largest contribution to @xmath7 , but it can be easily estimated , and we will see below that it is already too large . the leading effect of this kind comes from tree - level mixing between the zero - mode gauge bosons and the excited kk modes : s_bulk ~16 g_5 ^ 2 ( ) ^4 , where @xmath128 is the 5d gauge coupling , @xmath129 is the 4d vev that breaks electroweak symmetry , and @xmath130 is the mass of the lightest kk mode .",
    "( recall we are using units where @xmath73 . )",
    "the 5d gauge coupling parameterizes the cft contribution to the running of the 4d gauge coupling .",
    "for example , if there is a gauge kinetic term localized on the uv brane with coefficient @xmath131 , we have = + . in order to avoid a landau pole below the uv scale ,",
    "we require g_5 ^ 2 g_4 ^ 2 ( _ uv / _ ir ) . in order to have @xmath132 ( roughly the current experimental limit ) , we must have m_kk^2 4 v^2 ^1/2 .",
    "this shows that small values of @xmath7 can only arise from a hierarchy between @xmath133 and @xmath134 , which however requires fine tuning .",
    "the amount of fine tuning is given by ~ ( ) ^2 where @xmath135 is the cutoff in ir units and @xmath136 counts the number of kk modes below the cutoff .",
    "we see that we can make @xmath7 small only at the price of either fine - tuning , or taking @xmath137 to be small , meaning that the cutoff is so low that it describes only a small number of kk modes . in this case , the extra dimension is not really buying any predictive power relative to a general effective theory with a cutoff near the tev scale .",
    "said another way , since we must allow arbitrary higher - dimension operators suppressed by powers of @xmath135 , the expansion parameter of the effective theory is @xmath138 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the general phenomenology of a electroweak symmetry breaking sector consisting of a small-@xmath4 strongly coupled cft with an electroweak order parameter with dimension @xmath0 , with @xmath56 . in the case where the ( moderately ) small value of @xmath2 arises from a small parameter in the fundamental theory , we argue that the theory contains a prominent sub - tev scalar resonance which can be thought of as a higgs that is ` partially ' composite at the tev scale .",
    "the compositeness is ` partial ' in the sense that the couplings of the scalar to the strong tev scale dynamics is parametrically suppressed by powers of @xmath2 .",
    "although we are interested in 4d cft s that do not have a simple higher - dimensional interpretation , we begin by determining the properties of the lightest scalar kk modes in the rs model .",
    "we find the results illuminating , and will argue that they have a simple physical interpretation that extends to the case of a partially composite higgs .    to make a fully realistic rs model , we need a model with custodial symmetry . as explained in this",
    "can be done by gauging a @xmath139 in the bulk and breaking this down to @xmath140 on the uv brane . in the bulk , which is necessary to properly embed @xmath141 for bulk fermions .",
    "if fermions are elementary , as assumed here , there is no need for the @xmath142 factor in the bulk gauge group . ]",
    "since we are using rs only as a guide , we will ignore the issue of custodial symmetry and consider the model with only @xmath140 gauged in the bulk .",
    "however , it is straightforward to construct a fully realistic rs model at the price of fine - tuning .    we now consider the kk decomposition of the bulk scalar doublet @xmath74 .",
    "we are mainly interested in the kk modes of @xmath79 , which contains the light higgs - like boson ( see ) . the eigenvalue condition for kk masses of the @xmath79 with the fine - tuned boundary condition in the uv and the shifted boundary condition @xmath143 in the ir which corresponds to after subtracting the vev is given by = - , where x = , y = .",

    ". the scalar would be exactly massless in the limit of unbroken conformal symmetry , but the conformal symmetry is broken both in the uv and the ir . for _ finite _ @xmath2 in the limit @xmath148 , the ir breaking of conformal invariance dominates .",
    "hence , if the scalar couples to the cft with full strength , the conformal breaking should give @xmath149",
    ". however , in our case we expect from the general cft theorem that the scalar should decouple from the cft for @xmath150 .",
    "we exactly see this behavior in the first case in , where we have @xmath151 , and the interpretation of this is that @xmath2 controls the couplings of the scalar to the part of the cft in which conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken ( by the ir brane ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the uv breaking of conformal symmetry dominates for finite @xmath95 and @xmath150 . in this limit the scalar decouples from the cft at low energies ( as required by the general theorem ) but only logarithmically , just like an elementary scalar .    for realistic models ,",
    "the question of whether the breaking of conformal invariance is dominantly in the uv or the ir depends on the scale @xmath95 where the theory approaches the conformal fixed point",
    ". this scale could be as high as the planck scale even if the flavor scale is much lower , since the top flavor interactions may be a weak perturbation on the strong cft dynamics . in this case @xmath152 , and since we are interested in @xmath56 , we expect that the breaking of conformal symmetry is dominated in the ir .",
    "we will therefore mainly focus on this case in the following .",
    "we have taken @xmath3 in the above discussion in order to focus on the parametrics , but we are really interested in @xmath56 .",
    "we can easily compute the mass of the scalar kk modes in this simple model to see what we might expect for larger values of @xmath2 . in order to focus on the contribution to the scalar mass from the ir breaking of conformal symmetry we take @xmath148 , in which case",

    "we determine @xmath164 by demanding that the real scalar field @xmath165 is canonically normalized : 12 = _ _ ir^_uv d f^2_0 ( ) .",
    "the integral over the first term in involves @xmath166 , and the additional factor of @xmath167 makes this term dominate in the determination of @xmath164 . a similar integral appears when computing the @xmath168 coupling , and we therefore find that the @xmath168 coupling is equal to the standard model value up to @xmath169 corrections .",
    "more specifically , we find g_w w = g_w w^(sm ) . similarly , when computing the coupling of @xmath153 to the top quark , we note that the first term in dominates at large @xmath70 , so the top coupling is also approximately equal to the standard model , but this time with corrections suppressed by @xmath170 .",
    "this is so small that dominant corrections in fact come from perturbative top loops .",
    "therefore , we see that in the rs model the couplings of the light scalar to top quarks is very nearly equal to the standard model value , while the couplings to gauge bosons has a larger , order @xmath171 deviation from the standard model value .    we now describe the 4d cft interpretation of these results .",
    "the kk modes get massive due to the breaking of conformal symmetry , which occurs in both the uv and the ir .",
    "the uv breaking can be decoupled by sending @xmath148 .",
    "as @xmath150 a full scalar doublet is becoming massless , with deviations from standard model couplings suppressed ( at least ) by powers of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , this supports our interpretation that the scalar doublet is coupled to the strong cft with a coupling that vanishes as a power of @xmath2 . in rs setup fine - tuning",
    "is required to decouple the uv breaking of conformal invariance , so this is not a viable solution to the hierarchy problem , but as explained in section [ sec : scalarop ] this fine - tuning need not be present in small-@xmath4 models , which we turn to next .",
    "we now consider a strongly coupled small-@xmath4 cft with an electroweak order parameter ( ` higgs operator ' ) @xmath23 with dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the key feature of this theory is that @xmath2 is small enough to generate a large hierarchy between the flavor scale and the electroweak scale ( see ) , but at the same time large enough that the operator @xmath47 ( ` higgs mass term ' ) is irrelevant .",
    "we argued above that for @xmath3 , the dimension of @xmath47 is @xmath172 , which is therefore relevant .",
    "we are assuming that @xmath56 , but the @xmath169 corrections to the dimension of @xmath47 are large enough to make the operator irrelevant .",
    "there are at least two ways one can imagine this coming about .",
    "the first possibility is that there is no large or small parameter in the theory , and the fact that @xmath24 is close to @xmath173 is simply a numerical accident . in this case , we expect the low - energy effective theory below the scale @xmath174 to be a general strongly coupled nda theory with no small parameters .",
    "another possibility is that there is in fact a moderately small parameter in the fundamental theory that controls the size of @xmath2 .",
    "( for example , in the rs model this parameter is the mass of the bulk scalar . ) for @xmath56 it is expected that not all quantities will be numerically small even if parametrically suppressed by a power of @xmath2 .",
    "we assume one such numerical accident that the anomalous dimension of @xmath47 is large . , and",
    "therefore is expected to be more robust than the smallness of power corrections . ] in this subsection , we will describe the effective field theory below the tev scale for this theory .",
    "we will start with the limit @xmath3 , and then extrapolate to @xmath56 .",
    "as argued above , for @xmath3 the correlation functions of the operator @xmath23 are approximated by the correlation function of an elementary scalar doublet @xmath104 . in the range of energies where the theory is approximately conformal ,",
    "the theory can therefore be written in terms of a lagrangian where @xmath104 is coupled to a strong sector : = | d h|^2 - m^2 |h|^2 - 14 |h|^4 + c_1 ( _ 1 h^+ ) + , where @xmath175 is an operator in the strongly - coupled sector of the theory with the same quantum numbers as @xmath104 .",
    "we are interested in the case where the coupling to the strong sector is sufficiently strong so that the operators @xmath176 and @xmath177 have large anomalous dimensions , and are irrelevant .",
    "this allows us to neglect the couplings @xmath178 and @xmath179 in the conformal regime without fine tuning , and is the basic reason that this class of theories solves the hierarchy problem . in general , large anomalous dimensions for the operators @xmath176 and @xmath177 imply that @xmath180 , where @xmath2 is defined as the anomalous dimension of @xmath104 itself .",
    "however , it is an assumption of our analysis that @xmath56 is still small enough that an expansion in powers of @xmath2 gives at least qualitatively correct results for observables .    in order for the coupling @xmath181 to be important near the fixed point of the theory ,",
    "the scaling dimension of the operator must be sufficiently small ( 3 in the limit @xmath3 ) .",
    "we must assume that such an operator exists in order for @xmath104 to have sufficiently strong couplings to the strong sector of the cft . in order to make a contribution of order @xmath2 to the anomalous dimension of the scalar field",
    ", we must have c_1 ~4 .",
    "the powers of @xmath182 are counted using nda , which assumes that the theory has no large or small parameters other than @xmath2 .",
    "this is valid because our theory is by assumption a small-@xmath4 theory .",
    "does apply .",
    "] we can also consider couplings such as = c_2 _ 2 |h|^2 + c_3 ( _ 3 h^2 + ) + however , since by assumption @xmath176 has scaling dimension greater than 4 , @xmath183 is irrelevant near the fixed point .",
    "the coupling @xmath184 is only important at the fixed point if the @xmath185 triplet operator @xmath186 has a sufficiently low dimension ( 2 in the limit @xmath3 ) , but there is no reason to expect that an operator of such low dimension exists in the strong sector of the cft .",
    "this obviously generalizes to coupling involving higher powers of @xmath104 , and we conclude that the coupling of a single power of @xmath104 to the strong sector of the cft will dominate at the fixed point .",
    "now suppose that the conformal symmetry is broken at an ir scale @xmath174 .",
    "( we assume that the conformal fixed point is reached at very high energies , and therefore neglect any uv breaking of conformal symmetry . ) for example , we can have a new non - abelian gauge group that gauges a global symmetry of the cft . if the new gauge coupling is asymptotically free , it will get strong in the ir and break the conformal symmetry , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the point of this is that the breaking of conformal symmetry occurs in the strong sector of the cft , since the new gauge fields do not couple directly to @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , @xmath104 learns the conformal breaking only via coupling to the cft , and we would like to understand how @xmath2 controls this communication .    below the scale @xmath174 , the coupling @xmath181 in will generate all possible interactions of the scalar field @xmath104 . in particular , it will generate the @xmath176 and @xmath177 terms , which are no longer rendered irrelevant by the strong conformal dynamics .",

    "here we are again using the assumption that this is a small-@xmath4 theory . expanding out",

    "we now discuss the couplings of @xmath104 to the standard model gauge bosons . because @xmath194 , the function @xmath187 in the effective lagrangian contains all possible electroweak breaking couplings of @xmath104 and gauge bosons with @xmath195 coefficients in terms of @xmath196 and @xmath174 .",

    "as discussed above , we assume that @xmath199 is sufficiently large that @xmath200 at the weak scale .",
    "the leading coupling of @xmath104 to the top quark is therefore the same as in the standard model .",

    "this gives a contribution to @xmath12 that is parametrically smaller than the nda value : t ~ ~ t_nda .",
    "taken at face value , this is not so great for precision electroweak fits , since the best fit for nonzero electroweak corrections has both @xmath7 and @xmath12 positive and comparable .",

    "the phenomenology at high energy colliders depends on the structure of strong resonances at the tev scale .",

    "we have described a new paradigm for dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking in which the electroweak symmetry breaking sector is a conformal field theory ( cft ) above the tev scale .",
    "conformal symmetry and electroweak symmetry are broken at the tev scale , triggered by an asymptotically - free gauge group or a slightly relevant operator becoming strong , or by a relevant operator with a coefficient made small naturally by symmetries .",
    "any of these mechanisms stabilizes the weak scale against quantum corrections and gives a solution of the hierarchy problem .",

    "<S> we point out that the flavor problem in theories with dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking can be effectively decoupled if the physics above the tev scale is strongly conformal , and the electroweak order parameter has a scaling dimension @xmath0 with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> there are many restrictions on small values of @xmath2 : for @xmath3 , electroweak symmetry breaking requires a fine - tuning similar to that of the standard model ; large-@xmath4 conformal field theories ( including those obtained from the ads / cft correspondence ) require fine - tuning for @xmath5 ; ` walking technicolor ' theories can not have @xmath5 , according to gap equation analyses </S>",
    "<S> . however , strong small-@xmath4 conformal field theories with @xmath1 avoid all these constraints , and can give rise to natural dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking with a top quark flavor scale of order @xmath6 , large enough to decouple flavor . </S>",
    "<S> small-@xmath4 theories also have an acceptably small peskin - takeuchi @xmath7 parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this class of theories provides a new direction for dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking without problems from flavor or electroweak precision tests . </S>",
    "<S> a possible signal for these theories is a prominent scalar resonance below the tev scale with couplings similar to a heavy standard model higgs . </S>"
