    "recently , perfect state transfer in continuous - time quantum walks on graphs has received considerable attention .",
    "this is due to its potential applications for the transmission of quantum information over quantum networks .",
    "it was originally introduced by bose @xcite in the context of quantum walks on linear spin chains or paths .",
    "another reason for this strong interest is due to the universal property of quantum walks as a computational model as outlined by childs @xcite . from a graph - theoretic perspective , the main question is whether there is a spectral characterization of graphs which exhibit perfect state transfer .",
    "strong progress along these lines were given on highly structured graphs by bernasconi _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite for hypercubic graphs and by bai and petkovi @xcite for integral circulants .",
    "nevertheless , a general characterization remains elusive ( see godsil @xcite ) .",
    "christandl _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath0-fold cartesian product of the one - link @xmath17 and two - link @xmath18 graphs admit perfect state transfer .",
    "this is simply because @xmath17 and @xmath18 have end - to - end perfect state transfer and the cartesian product operator preserves perfect state transfer .",
    "they also drew a crucial connection between hypercubic networks and weighted paths using the so - called _ path - collapsing _ argument .",
    "this argument was also used by childs _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite in the context of an exponential algoritmic speedup for a black - box graph search problem via continuous - time quantum walks .",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite proved that , although the @xmath0-vertex path @xmath19 , for @xmath20 , has no end - to - end perfect state transfer , a suitably weighted version of @xmath19 has perfect state transfer ( via a path - collapsing reduction from the @xmath0-cube @xmath1 ) .",
    "a somewhat critical ingredient of this reduction is that each layer of @xmath1 is an empty graph .",
    "we generalize this argument to graphs which have equitable distance partitions ( see godsil and royle @xcite ) .    ' '' ''    bose _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite observed an interesting phenomena on the complete graph @xmath21 .",
    "although @xmath21 does not exhibit perfect state transfer , they show that by removing an edge between any two vertices , perfect state transfer is created between them .",
    "note that the graph we obtain from removing an edge from @xmath21 is the double cone @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 denotes the join of graphs @xmath2 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "this observation was generalized in angeles - canul _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite where perfect state transfer was proved for double cones @xmath24 , where @xmath2 is some regular graph ( in place of complete graphs ) .",
    "the analyses on these double cones showed that perfect state transfer need not occur between antipodal vertices and that having integer eigenvalues is not a sufficient condition for perfect state transfer ( which answered questions raised in @xcite ) .",
    "our goal in this work is to combine and extend both the cartesian product and the double cone constructions . the cartesian product construction ( which combines graphs with perfect state transfer ) has the advantage of producing large diameter graphs with antipodal perfect state transfer . in fact",
    ", this construction provides the best upper bound for the order - diameter problem ; for a given @xmath25 , let @xmath26 be the smallest size graph which has perfect state transfer between two vertices of distance @xmath25 .",
    "then , the best known bounds are @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , if @xmath25 is odd , and @xmath29 , if @xmath25 is even ; here , the upper bounds are achieved by @xmath30 and @xmath31 . on the other hand , the double cone construction allows graphs whose quotients ( modulo its equitable partition ) contain cells which are not independent sets .",
    "this can potentially allow for a broader class of graphs with perfect state transfer ( see bose _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite and angeles - canul _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite ) .    in this work",
    ", we describe new constructions of families of graphs with perfect state transfer .",
    "first , we extend several of the double cone constructions and relax their diameter restrictions .",
    "we show that the double cone @xmath32 of an arbitrary connected graph @xmath2 has perfect state transfer if we use edge weights proportional to the perron eigenvector of @xmath2 .",
    "this extends results given in @xcite where @xmath2 is required to be a regular graph .",
    "then , we prove that the glued double cone graph @xmath33 has perfect state transfer whenever @xmath34 belongs to some class of regular graphs and if they are connected using some matrix @xmath35 which commutes with the adjacency matrices of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast , angeles - canul _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite proved that @xmath38 has no perfect state transfer , for any regular graph @xmath2 , even if weights are allowed .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ' '' ''    for cones with larger diameter , we consider the graph @xmath39 , where @xmath34 belong to the same class of regular graphs and @xmath5 is another regular graph .",
    "this symmetry is a necessary condition for perfect state transfer as shown by kay @xcite . nevertheless , in contrast to the previous positive results , we show there is no perfect state transfer whenever @xmath5 is the empty graph .",
    "the @xmath40-dimensional cube @xmath41 ( which has perfect state transfer ) is an example of such a graph but without the join ( or complete bipartite ) connection .",
    "our other contribution involves constructions of perfect state transfer graphs using alternative graph products , namely the weak and lexicographic products .",
    "an interesting property of these products is that they can create perfect state transfer graphs by combining graphs with perfect state transfer and ones which lack the property .",
    "for example , we show that @xmath42 has perfect state transfer , for any integers @xmath0 and @xmath43 .",
    "recall that the complete graph has no perfect state transfer ( as observed by bose _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite ) . in comparison ,",
    "the cartesian product requires both of its graph arguments to have perfect state transfer ( with the same perfect state transfer times ) .",
    "we also consider the lexicographic graph product ( or graph composition ) and its generalizations . our generalized lexicographic product of @xmath2 and @xmath5 using a connection matrix ( or graph )",
    "@xmath35 is a graph whose adjacency matrix is @xmath44 .",
    "note we recover the cartesian product by letting @xmath45 and the standard lexicographic product by letting @xmath46 .",
    "so , this generalization interpolates between these two known graph products .",
    "for example , we show that @xmath11 $ ] has perfect state transfer for any integral graph @xmath2 and @xmath12 .",
