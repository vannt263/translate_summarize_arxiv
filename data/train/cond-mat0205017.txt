    "the name  quantum mechanics \" is associated with the idea that the energy is quantized . for generic ( chaotic )",
    "system the mean level spacing is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dimensionality of the system .",
    "however , one should recognize that there is a second energy scale @xmath1 which is introduced by quantum mechanics .",
    "this @xmath4 energy scale is related to the chaos implied decay of the classical correlations .",
    "it is known in the literature as the  non - universal \" energy scale @xcite , or as the  bandwidth \" @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless bandwidth is defined as @xmath5 .",
    "for reasonably small @xmath4 one has @xmath6 .",
    "this observation , of having two energy scales , has motivated the study of wigner model @xcite within the framework of random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "this model , which is defined in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath7 , is totally artificial : it does not possess any classical limit . still note that it can be re - interpreted as a model for the motion of a particle in a quasi one - dimensional _ disordered _ lattice  @xcite .",
    "the main focus of quantum chaos studies ( so far ) was on issues of spectral statistics @xcite . in that context",
    "it turns out that the sub-@xmath4 statistical features of the energy spectrum are  universal \" , and obey the predictions of random matrix theory .",
    "non universal ( system specific ) features are reflected only in the large scale properties of the spectrum ( analyzing energy intervals @xmath8 ) .      in recent years",
    "we have made some progress in understanding the theory of driven quantized chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "driven systems are described by hamiltonian @xmath9 , where  @xmath10 is a time dependent parameter .",
    "such systems are of interest in mesoscopic physics ( quantum dots ) , as well as in nuclear , atomic and molecular physics . the time dependent parameter @xmath10 may have the significance of external electric field or magnetic flux or gate voltage .",
    "linear driving @xmath11 is characterized by one parameter ( @xmath12 ) , while more generally a periodic driving @xmath13 is characterized by both amplitude ( @xmath14 ) and frequency ( @xmath15 ) . due to the time dependence of @xmath10 ,",
    "the energy of the system is not a constant of motion .",
    "rather the system makes  transitions \" between energy levels , and therefore absorbs energy .",
    "the main object of our studies is the energy spreading kernel @xmath16 .",
    "regarded as a function of the level index @xmath17 , it gives the energy distribution after time @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the initial level .",
    "having two quantal energy scales implies the existence of different quantum - mechanical ( qm ) @xmath12  _ regimes _ @xcite , or more generally @xmath20  _ regimes _ @xcite , in the theory of @xmath16 .",
    "most familiar is the qm adiabatic regime ( very very small  @xmath12 ) , whose existence is associated with having finite  @xmath0 .",
    "outside of the adiabatic regime we are used to the idea that there is a perturbative regime , where the fermi golden rule applies , leading to a markovian picture of the dynamics , with well defined transition rates between levels .",
    "less familiar @xcite is the qm non - perturbative regime ( @xmath12 is quantum mechanically large , but still classically small ) whose existence is associated with the energy scale  @xmath7 . as implied by the terminology , in the qm non - perturbative regime perturbation theory ( to any order ) is not a valid tool for the analysis of the energy spreading .",
    "consequently the fermi golden rule picture of the dynamics does not apply there .      of special importance ( see discussion below )",
    "is the theory for the variance @xmath21 of the energy spreading .",
    "having @xmath22 means _",
    "linear response_. if @xmath23 depends on @xmath14 we call it  non - linear response \" . in this paragraph",
    "we explain that linear response theory ( lrt ) is based on the  lrt formula \" @xmath24 two spectral functions are involved : one is the power spectrum @xmath25 of the fluctuations , and the other @xmath26 is the spectral content of the driving . see eq.([e4 ] ) and eq.([e5 ] ) for exact definitions . a special case of eq.([e1 ] )",
    "is the sudden limit ( @xmath27 ) for which @xmath28 is a step function , hence @xmath29 , and accordingly @xmath30}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] another special case is the response for persistent ( either linear or periodic ) driving . in such case the long time limit of @xmath31 is linear in time [ e.g. for linear driving ( @xmath32 ) we get @xmath33 .",
    "this implies diffusive behavior : @xmath34}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the latter case the expression for @xmath35 is known as kubo ( or kubo - greenwood ) formula , leading to a fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite .",
    "the lrt formula eq.([e1 ] ) has a simple classical derivation@xcite . from now on",
    "it goes without saying that we assume that the _ classical _ conditions on @xmath20 for the validity of eq.([e1 ] ) are satisfied ( no @xmath4 involved in such conditions ) .",
    "the question is _ what happens to the validity of lrt once we  quantize \" the system_. can we trust eq.([e1 ] ) for any @xmath20 ? or maybe we can trust it only in a restricted regime ? in previous publications@xcite , we were able to argue the following : +    * the lrt formula can be trusted in the perturbative regime , with the exclusion of the adiabatic regime .",
    "* in the sudden limit the lrt formula can be trusted also in the non - perturbative regime . * in general",
    "the lrt formula can not be trusted in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "* the lrt formula can be trusted deep in the non - perturbative regime , provided the system has a classical limit .    for a system that does not have a classical limit ( wigner model )",
    "we were able to demonstrate @xcite that lrt fails in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "namely , for wigner model the response @xmath23 becomes @xmath14 dependent for large @xmath14 , meaning that the response is non - linear .",
    "hence the statement in item ( c ) above has been established .",
    "we had argued that the observed non - linear response is the result of a quantal non - perturbative effect . _",
    "do we have a similar type of non - linear response in case of quantized chaotic systems ? _ the statement in item ( d ) above seems to suggest that the observation of such non - linearity is not likely .",
    "still , we argue below that this does not exclude the possibility of observing a  weak \" non - linearity .",
    "the immediate ( naive ) tendency is to regard lrt as the outcome of first order perturbation theory ( fopt ) .",
    "in fact the regimes of validity of fopt and of lrt do not coincide . on the one hand we have the adiabatic regime where fopt is valid as a leading order description , but not for response calculation ( see further details below ) . on the other hand , the validity of eq.([e1 ] )",
    "goes well beyond fopt .",
    "this leads to the ( correct ) identification @xcite of what we call the  perturbative regime \" .",
    "the border of this regime [ in @xmath20 space ] is determined by the energy scale @xmath7 , while @xmath0 is not involved .",
    "outside of the perturbative regime we can not trust the lrt formula .",
    "however , as we further explain below , the fact that eq.([e1 ] ) is not valid in the non - perturbative regime , does not imply that it _ fails _ there .",
    "we stress again that one should distinguish between  non - perturbative response \" and  non - linear response \" .",
    "these are not synonyms . as we explain in the next paragraph ,",
    "the adiabatic regime is  perturbative \" but  non - linear \" , while the semiclassical limit is  non - perturbative \" but  linear \" .    in the _ adiabatic regime _ , fopt implies zero probability to make a transitions to other levels .",
    "therefore , to the extend that we can trust the adiabatic approximation , all the probability remains concentrated in the initial level .",
    "thus , in the adiabatic regime , eq.([e1 ] ) is not a valid formula : it is essential to use higher orders of perturbation theory , and possibly non - perturbative corrections ( landau - zener @xcite ) , in order to calculate the response .",
    "still , fopt provides a meaningful leading order description of the dynamics ( i.e. having no transitions ) , and therefore we do not regard the adiabatic non - linear regime as  non - perturbative \" .    in the _ non - perturbative regime _",
    "the evolution of @xmath16 can not be extracted from perturbation theory : not in leading order , neither in any order .",
    "still it does not necessarily imply a non - linear response . on the contrary : the semiclassical limit is contained in the ( deep ) non - perturbative regime@xcite .",
    "there , the lrt formula eq.([e1 ] ) is in fact valid .",
    "but its validity is _ not _ a consequence of perturbation theory , but rather the consequence of _ quantal - classical correspondence_.",
    "as stated above , an effect of non - linear response due to the _ quantum mechanical _ non - perturbative nature of the dynamics , has been demonstrated so far only for wigner model @xcite . there , its existence is related to the _ disordered _ rmt nature of the model ( see discussion below ) .",
    "semiclassical correspondence considerations seem to exclude the manifestation of this disorder - related non - linearity in case of quantized _ chaotic _ systems . in this letter",
    "we explain that this does not exclude the possibility of having a  weak \" version of this effect .",
    "we also report the results of an intense numerical effort aimed in finding a  weak \" non - linearity in the case of a simple low - dimensional quantized chaotic systems . to our surprise ,",
    "an unexpected degree of semiclassical correspondence is observed .",
    "it is appropriate here to clarify the notions of  weak \" and  strong \" effects . in the literature regarding the dynamics in disordered lattices",
    "one distinguishes between  weak \" and  strong \" localization effects .",
    "the former term implies that while the leading behavior is classical ( diffusion ) , there are  on top \" quantum mechanical corrections ( enhanced return probability ) . in contrast to",
    "that the term  strong \" implies that the classical description fails even as a leading order description . in the literature regarding quantum chaos we have the effect of  scarring \" , which should be regarded as",
    " weak `` effect . ' ' strong \" quantum mechanical effects ( e.g. dynamical localization in 1d kicked systems @xcite ) are non - generic : the leading order behavior of generic quantized chaotic systems is typically classical . in the present context of driven systems",
    ", we use the terms  weak \" and  strong \" in the same sense : the adjective  weak \" is associated with the ( conjectured ) non - linear response of quantized driven chaotic systems , while the adjective  strong \" is associated with the ( established ) non - linear response in the corresponding rmt ( wigner ) model .",
    "how do we detect non - linear response ?",
    "the most straightforward way is to fix the pulse shape @xmath28 and to plot @xmath36 versus @xmath14 .",
    "a deviation from constant value means `` non - linear '' response .",
    "the simulations below are done for a quantized chaotic system . due to obvious numerical limitations",
    "we will consider the response to one - pulse driving , rather than to persistent ( periodic ) driving . _",
    "the central question is whether the observed non - linear effect is of semiclassical origin , or of novel quantum mechanical origin_. we deal with this issue below .    in our numerical simulations ( fig.1 )",
    "we have considered a particle in a two dimensional ( @xmath37 ) anharmonic well . this model ( with deformation parameter @xmath38 ) is defined in @xcite . in the energy region of interest ( @xmath39 ) , the classical motion inside the two dimensional well ( 2dw ) is chaotic , with characteristic correlation time @xmath40 . for the following presentation",
    "it is enough to say that the quantum mechanical hamiltonian is represented by a matrix @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a diagonal matrix with mean level spacing @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is a banded matrix .",
    "the bandwidth ( in energy units ) is @xmath45 .",
    "the bandprofile ( see fig.2 of @xcite ) is described by a spectral function which is defined as follows : @xmath46 with implicit average over the reference state @xmath19 .",
    "the bandprofile , as defined above , can be determined from the the classical dynamics .",
    "this means that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fourier transform of a classical correlation function @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath25 is relatively weak .",
    "the driving pulse in our numerical simulations has a rectangular shape .",
    "this means @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "the spectral content of the driving is defined as : @xmath53 the spectral content of the driving after a rectangular pulse is @xmath54 .",
    "we have also made simulations ( not presented ) with a driving scheme that involves a positive pulse @xmath55 followed by a negative pulse @xmath56 , with the intention of considering eventually a persistent ( multi cycle ) periodic driving .",
    "however , we have realized that all the relevant physics is observed already in the single pulse case .",
    "note that the regime diagram for either linear or ( as in the following simulations ) rectangular driving pulse , is greatly simplified , because the driving is characterized by only one parameter ( @xmath12 in the former case , @xmath14 in the latter case ) .",
    "let us look carefully at the results of the 2dw simulations ( fig.1 ) . for small @xmath14 we see",
    "as expected  linear response \" meaning @xmath57 , as implied by eq.([e1 ] ) .",
    "note that the  constant \" has a weak @xmath4 dependence ( a @xmath58 effect ) .",
    "this is due to the above mentioned weak dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath4 .",
    "so this quantum - mechanical effect is quite trivial , and has a simple explanation within lrt .",
    "now let us look what happens for large @xmath14 .",
    "we clearly see a @xmath59  deviation from linear response . in what follows",
    "we discuss the reason for this non - linear effect .    for sake of comparison",
    "we also perform simulations with an effective rmt model that corresponds to the 2dw model hamiltonian .",
    "the effective rmt model is obtained by randomizing the signs of the off - diagonal elements of the @xmath44 matrix .",
    "the effective rmt hamiltonian has the _ same _ bandprofile @xmath25 as the original ( 2dw ) hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , as far as lrt eq.([e1 ] ) is concerned , the response should be the _",
    "same_. still we see that at the same @xmath14 regime , as in the case of the 2dw simulations , we have deviation from linear response .",
    "however , this non - linear deviation is much much stronger .    looking at the curves of fig.1 , it is very tempting to regard the observed non - linear @xmath59 effect in the 2dw simulations as a  weak \" version of the  strong \" effect which is observed in the corresponding rmt simulations .",
    "however , the careful analysis below indicates that apparently this is not the case .",
    "in analyzing the validity of the lrt formula , it is instructive to consider first the sudden limit eq.([e1 ] ) .",
    "this limit has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the spreading profile @xmath60 , after the sudden change in @xmath61 , depends on the amplitude @xmath14 of the perturbation .",
    "[ we omit the time index @xmath18 , which is of no relevance in this limit ] .",
    "the perturbative regime is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 . for the 2dw simulations @xmath64 . in the perturbative regime",
    "@xmath60 has a core - tail structure ( the generalization of wigner lorentzian ) , and the variance @xmath65 is determined by the first order tail component of the energy distribution .",
    "for @xmath66 the spreading profile @xmath60 becomes non - perturbative .",
    "this means that the perturbative tail ( if survives ) is no longer the predominant feature .",
    "thus the variance is determined by the non - perturbative component ( the  core \" ) of the energy distribution .",
    "the remarkable fact is that the crossover from the perturbative @xmath14 regime to the non - perturbative @xmath14 regime is _ not _ reflected in the variance ( see fig.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the agreement with eq.([e2 ] ) is perfect .",
    "taking into account the  dramatic \" differences in the appearance of @xmath60 , this looks quite surprising .",
    "in fact ( see sec.12 of @xcite ) there is a simple proof @xcite that eq.([e2 ] ) remains exact beyond any order of perturbation theory , which means that it is exact even in the non - perturbative regime where perturbation theory is not applicable .",
    "we turn back to our simulations , where we have a rectangular pulse ( rather than step function ) . here",
    "the sudden limit does not apply , and the dynamics within the time interval @xmath67 should be taken into account .",
    "if we take an eigenstate of @xmath42 and propagate it using @xmath68 , then we get in the classical case _",
    "ballistic _ spreading followed by saturation .",
    "[ `` eigenstate '' in the classical case means microcanonical distribution ] .",
    "this is true for any @xmath14 .",
    "quantum mechanically we observe in the 2dw model simulations a similar ballistic behavior @xcite , whereas in the corresponding rmt model there is an intermediate stage of _ diffusion _ @xcite .",
    "this diffusion is of non - perturbative nature , and it is related to the  disorder \" which is artificially introduced via the sign - randomization procedure . the strong non - linear response effect @xcite is a consequence of this diffusion .",
    "coming back to the 2dw model , we realize that there is no  disorder \" build into the model , and therefore no diffusion . still , looking at fig.1 ,",
    "it is tempting to interpret the observed @xmath59  non - linear deviation as a  weak \" version of the strong non - linear effect .",
    "moreover , regarded as such , it vanishes , as expected , in the deep non - perturbative regime , which had been argued on the basis of semiclassical correspondence considerations@xcite .    in order to properly determine whether the dips in fig.1 are the result of the qm non - perturbative nature of the dynamics",
    ", we have rescaled the vertical axis , and plotted the response once ( fig.2a ) versus @xmath14 , and once ( fig.2b ) versus @xmath69 . on the basis of the scaling we see that the strong non - linear response in the rmt case is indeed the result of the quantal ( @xmath4-dependent ) non - perturbative effect . in",
    "contrary to that the @xmath4-independent scaling in the 2dw case , indicates that the non - linear deviation there is of  semiclassical \" rather than ",
    "quantal non - perturbative \" nature .",
    "theoretical arguments can not exclude the existence of a  weak \" non - linearity in the response of a driven quantized chaotic system , which is due to a quantum mechanical non - perturbative effect .",
    "but our careful numerics , regarding a simple low - dimensional system , demonstrates an unexpected degree of semiclassical correspondence .",
    "our findings should be regarded as the outcome of an ongoing quest , which has not ended , that is aimed in finding novel quantum mechanical deviations from linear response theory .",
