    "theoretical studies of the early universe predict the existence of first - generation stars which lack metals and consequently have unique physical structures and properties @xcite .",
    "such objects have not , however , been detected to date in either the high - redshift or local universe .",
    "therefore , indirect inferences from modelling the impact of primordial stars and supernovae ( sne ) on their environment through radiative and chemical feedback remain important .",
    "the reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and the widespread metal enrichment of high-@xmath6 galaxies , qsos and the igm provide strong observational constraints for such theoretical studies .",
    "a particularly effective tool in constraining the masses and properties of the first stars has been to combine their ionizing photon and nucleosynthetic signatures @xcite .",
    "when we examine the current data and the results of theoretical work , an interesting coincidence becomes apparent : that three important cosmic transitions occur at gas metallicities of about @xmath7@xmath0 . to begin with",
    ", the universe first generates sufficient ionizing photons for hydrogen reionization when the igm reaches these metallicities @xcite .",
    "second , theoretical studies of the cooling and fragmentation of gas in early galaxies reveal that the primordial stellar initial mass function ( imf ) evolves from its metal - free to present - day form at gas transition metallicities of @xmath8@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this transition results from the physics of gas cooling in early galaxies , when the dominant cooling channel switches from molecular hydrogen to metal lines or dust grains , with the latter pathway dominating in systems with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "third , there are indications that the relative abundances of cno and alpha - elements in metal - poor stars in the galactic halo have increased scatter and altered ratios when the iron content of these stars falls below @xmath10 of solar values ( @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "these subsolar mass objects are thought to be second - generation stars that formed from metal - poor fragmenting gas in the shells of the very first sne in early galaxies @xcite .",
    "such stars contain the fossil imprint of nucleosynthesis from the preceding generations of metal - free stars , reflecting the `` prompt inventory '' of metals @xcite .",
    "when these three points are taken together , we see that several cosmological milestones occured by metallicities of @xmath11 , a relation that must result from the strong feedback between the buildup of ionizing radiation and the formation of second - generation stars . in this letter",
    ", we quantitatively demonstrate a novel connection in the environment of extremely metal - poor ( emp ) halo stars between two of these relationships : that the stellar population that was important for early nucleosynthesis is also responsible for cosmological reionization .",
    "we define emp stars as those with [ fe / h ] @xmath12 -3 @xcite .",
    "we examine the significance of the second transition in relation to the other two in a subsequent work , where we plan to use numerical simulations to investigate the spatially varying feedback between gas cooling and the propagation of ionizing radiation in the first galaxies .",
    "we begin by showing the trends of element abundances in emp stars from current observations .",
    "we follow our approach in @xcite and take the data from @xcite , and @xcite and references therein .",
    "for the two most iron - poor stars , he-0107 - 5240 and he-1327 - 2326 , we use the published abundances from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the last of these papers has recently revised the cno abundances of he-1327 - 2326 when 3d nlte corrections are taken into consideration .",
    "we focus on the elements c , o , si and fe , as these are amongst the dominant metals created in primordial sne and are the most important coolants in metal - free gas @xcite .    the trends of [ c / h ] , [ o / h ] , [ si / h ] and [ c / o ] as a function of iron abundance [ fe / h ] are shown in figure 1 , where for an element x , we define [ x / h ] as the ratio of the measured column densities of x / h to its solar ratio .",
    "we display those points with [ fe / h ] @xmath12 -2 in order to span the predicted @xmath13 in individual elements @xcite , as we will see below .",
    "we assume that emp stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath12 -3 have been enriched only by metal - free stars , consistent with the estimate of @xmath13 from @xcite and with recent calculations using merger tree models in which stars of metallicities @xmath12 @xmath4 reflect enrichment from only one to a few primordial sne @xcite .",
    "+    = 1.0    figure 1 reveals some interesting trends .",
    "first , for those stars that have both abundances measured , [ c / o ] shows no clear trend with [ fe / h ] ; in fact , it appears to have its maximum value at the lowest [ fe / h ] .",
    "such element abundance ratios are often used as a cosmic clock to track the creation of elements from stars of differing lifetimes , but such a relation may not be easily derived in emp stars , a point which we return to in the discussion .",
    "second , carbon and silicon roughly track fe in enrichment relative to h , whereas oxygen does not .",
    "again , the exceptions to this trend are the most fe - poor stars .",
    "note that some of the stellar data shown here come from surveys that select against c - rich emp stars @xcite , owing to the complicated analyses involved in such cases .",
    "the more recent survey by @xcite does not have this bias , although these authors focus mostly on @xmath14-process element abundances in emp stars .    a direct translation of the observed abundances in emp halo stars to yields from primordial sne and constraints on the first - stars imf would be ideal , but is complicated by several factors .",
    "mass transfer from a companion may alter original abundance ratios , but is difficult to model owing to the unknown binary fraction of the first stellar generations , and the role of agb phase dredge - ups and mass loss for metal - free stars .",
    "we have not plotted those emp stars known to be in binaries in figure 1 , but it is possible that many of these stars have as yet undetected companions . a uniform sample coverage of the cno elements would constrain this scenario better .    in order to assess the implications of the nucleosynthetic data in emp stars for reionization , we follow the approach in @xcite and @xcite . we calculate the ionizing efficiency , @xmath15 , which is essentially a conversion factor defined as the ratio of the energy produced in rest mass of metals , @xmath16 , and the energy released in the h - ionizing continuum : @xmath17    the first stars are expected to be metal - free in composition , a factor that critically influences their structure and leads to the emission of significantly harder ionizing radiation relative to low-@xmath18 stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath15 is a strong function of stellar metallicity and increases by a factor of 1020 from @xmath19 to @xmath20 stars , owing to the boosted ionizing flux and substantially reduced metal yield from massive stars with decreasing stellar metallicity .",
    "the latter trend is a result of the more compact structure of metal - poor stars , which directly leads to greater element fallback onto the remnant after the sn explosion .",
    "the stellar imf is assumed to have the form , @xmath21 , which is normalized over the mass range as , @xmath22 .",
    "we consider two primordial imfs , one that has 1001000 @xmath23 stars with a flat imf slope ( hereafter very massive stars ; vmss ) , as some theoretical studies indicate @xcite , and a present - day imf with 1100 @xmath23 stars where the imf slope has a salpeter value , @xmath24 .",
    "we use the ionizing spectra from @xcite and @xcite for vmss , and the results from @xcite for the 1100 @xmath23 imf .",
    "we take the metal yields from @xcite for 1040 m@xmath25 stars , which end their lives as type ii sne , and from @xcite for stars with masses 140260 @xmath23 which explode entirely as pair - instability sne .",
    "all other massive stars are assumed to collapse into black holes with no contribution to the nucleosynthetic output .",
    "varying the upper and lower mass limits in the vms imf will not significantly impact our conclusions , owing to the narrow mass range of element synthesis from vms sne , and to the near - identical ionizing photon production per stellar baryon in all stars with masses @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we do not include cases where the conversion efficiency is derived including the metal yield from intermediate - mass stars , as @xmath15 remains approximately the same for oxygen and exactly the same for si .",
    "for carbon , @xmath15 decreases by a factor of a few with intermediate - mass stars owing to their large yield in c. for the purposes of this paper , we wish to track the growth of ionizing radiation which is dominated by the massive stars in the imf .",
    "we do not include the yield from type ia sne in our calculations .",
    "recent studies indicate that such sne may not occur in metal - free stellar populations @xcite , although this is a sensitive function of the sn mechanism itself and of the unknown binarity in @xmath20 stars .",
    "as shown in @xcite and @xcite , calculations of @xmath15 can be used to compute the number of ionizing photons per baryon generated in association with a metallicity that is observed in a given system .",
    "these papers focussed on the igm , and pointed out that the universe first generates about 10 ionizing photons per igm baryon for the observed igm metallicity of @xmath27 .",
    "this estimate is however subject to the uncertainties of star formation efficiency and the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from early galaxies . here",
    ", we examine the ionizing efficiency in the environment of emps , and calculate @xmath28 , the number of ionizing photos created per baryon in stars , which is not related to the above highly uncertain astrophysical parameters . following @xcite , for an element @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( 1 gev/@xmath31",
    "; we assume the imf - averaged energy of a ly - continuum photon , @xmath32 = 27 ev ( 30 ev ) for metal - free stars in a present - day ( vms ) imf .",
    "for our calculations here , we take the values of @xmath15 for carbon and oxygen computed in @xcite , and compute them independently for silicon .",
    "we find that for the 1100 @xmath23 salpeter - slope imf , @xmath15 has values of 0.48 , 0.2 and 1.34 for c , o and si respectively ; for a vms imf , the corresponding values are 0.098 , 0.01 , and 0.057 . using these numbers ,",
    "we show the results of our calculations in figure 2 , where the number of ionizing photons created per baryon in emp stars , @xmath28 , is shown as a function of [ fe / h ] for the elements c , o and si in three separate panels . in each case",
    ", the ionizing photon contribution from a present - day and a vms imf are plotted .",
    "a number of trends seen in figure 2 are of relevance to the first - stars field .",
    "first , vms make a low but persistent contribution to the overall ionizing photon budget in association with the metals locked in emp stars , typically an order of magnitude less than the 1100 @xmath23 imf .",
    "this is because vmss are in general less efficient at generating total ionizing radiation per unit metal yield relative to other metal - free stellar populations , owing to the large metal production from vmss .",
    "second , the slow buildup of metals and the associated ionizing radiation is apparent , for each element and for each imf .",
    "this trend appears most obvious for oxygen , although there is a significant scatter in the correlation between @xmath28 and [ fe / h ] at any given [ fe / h ] . as we stated earlier , the notable exceptions are the two stars at the lowest values of [ fe / h ] .",
    "third , we show in each panel the approximate criterion to generate an optical depth in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) of about 0.1 , consistent with data from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( @xmath2 ; @xcite ) , of about @xmath33 34,000 @xcite .",
    "this number is derived from interpolating between cases studied by @xcite where the lifetime - integrated ionizing photon production from various stellar populations and imfs were calculated and used as inputs in detailed cosmological reionization models .",
    "interestingly , the emp data indicates that this line is crossed at least once _ and perhaps twice _ between -4 @xmath34 [ fe / h ] @xmath34 -3 by a present - day imf .",
    "this is best seen in the panel corresponding to si , where a clear dip in @xmath35 occurs between -3.6 @xmath34 [ fe / h ] @xmath34 -3 .",
    "the vms imf appears to never meet this criterion over the metallicity ranges considered here , consistent with the role of vmss in igm reionization predicted by @xcite .",
    "+      conducting a metal census of the universe from emp stars and from the igm is important in both environments , despite their differing systematics .",
    "the igm contains nearly all of the baryons at high redshifts but the former case permits a detailed star - by - star analysis of the cosmic enrichment history . by working with nucleosynthetic data in emp stars rather than the igm",
    ", we have not assigned a global fixed metallicity with the appropriately scaled individual element values according to their solar ratios .",
    "rather , we have derived parallel constraints for reionization from a number of elements independently , which is a considerably stronger approach .",
    "in addition , observations of emp stars relative to igm absorbers provide significantly larger element coverage in the well - constrained environment of stellar atmospheres , a situation that will greatly improve in the near future .",
    "although we naively apply the same factor for ionization efficiency for [ fe / h ] @xmath36 -3 , @xmath15 is likely to be closer to the values associated with metal - poor stars , typically a factor of a few to 10 lower , owing to their increased metal yield .",
    "depending on the individual metal abundance , this could lead to a less steep rise or flattening in the behavior of @xmath28 at [ fe / h ] @xmath36 -3 .",
    "this prediction is somewhat more speculative , as the integrated contribution from many subsequent stellar generations of varying metallicities will be difficult to distinguish in this environment .",
    "the notable exceptions to most of the trends noted above are the two most fe - poor stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -5.5 . at such low metallicities , one would expect that these stars reflect enrichment from a single sn @xcite .",
    "these stars are , however , highly over - enriched in several elements including c , o and si , to the degree that they are actually not metal - poor , but rather at metallicities of nearly a tenth solar . how these stars came to acquire such skewed element abundances",
    "relative to solar ratios remains puzzling at present .",
    "some possibilities include pollution from a binary companion , from a subluminous hypernova with fine - tuned ratios of mixing and fallback @xcite , or the effects of stellar rotation and ensuing mass loss which could dramatically boost the production of cno elements @xcite .",
    "the ratio of these elements to iron or relative to each other is sometimes used as a chronometer in other astrophysical environments . for the most fe - poor stars ,",
    "however , it is clear that ratios such as [ fe / o ] or [ c / o ] are not easily related to time .",
    "these should normally increase with age of a stellar population as the stars of progressively lower mass evolve off the main sequence , but as we saw in figure 1 for emp stars , [ c / o ] achieves its highest values at the lowest [ fe / h ] . perhaps these stars were created in atypical environments as the igm approached reionization , as seen from the generation of ionizing radiation in figure 2  the most fe - poor stars appear to have formed at epochs when , for a metal - free present - day imf , @xmath28 nearly equals or exceeds the criterion from @xmath2 , at least for c. one interesting explanation of this , in addition to those above , could be that the most fe - poor halo stars are also true second - generation stars : ones that formed through the dust grain cooling pathway ( @xmath37 ) rather than through metal line cooling using c , o or si ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the unusual element trends in these stars could then be explained through the element segregation predicted in a scenario involving dust transport in early galaxies .",
    "here , conditions in primordial sn remnants result in the radiative transport of dust in the hot radiation field from metal - free stars , leading to selective element enhancement from compounds such as graphites and silicates in the cooling gas in sn shells @xcite , which are likely the sites of emp star formation .    what do the results in this paper imply for cosmology ?",
    "those emp stars which have observational age estimates are about 1213 gyr old @xcite . in the context of our results",
    ", it appears that most of the emp stars formed close to the end of or soon after cosmological reionization .",
    "that reionization occurs in the first gyr of the universe ( by @xmath5 6 ) is no surprise , as this is already clear from gunn - peterson studies of the high-@xmath6 igm @xcite and from current cmb data .",
    "a more interesting result of translating the emp star abundances in c , o and si into the accompanying production of ionizing photons per baryon in stars is the clear buildup of ionizing radiation until reionization is accomplished at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -3 , [ si / h ] @xmath1 -3.5 and [ o / h ] @xmath1 -2.5 ( [ c / h ] ranges from -4 to -2 at these fe - metallicities ) . at this point ,",
    "the initial stellar population ( presumably metal - free ) must turn off , as seen from the altered element abundance patterns at higher [ fe / h ] , leading to a new pattern of nucleosynthesis from different sne .",
    "@xcite argue for the presence of a primordial sn population up to [ fe / h ] or [ mg / h ] values of about -3 , with a combination of primordial and nonprimordial sne at higher metallicities .",
    "such a truncation in the mode of star formation is most likely attributed to the critical metallicity being reached in the gas in which emp stars formed , signalling an end to the first - stars epoch .",
    "given certain conditions of density and temperature , @xmath13 can be higher in iron than in carbon , oxygen , or silicon .",
    "this is not consistent , however , with the overall trend of enhanced c , o and si at _ low _ [ fe / h ] . a naive projection of the above metallicities in fe , si , o and c at which reionization `` occurs '' in figure 2 implies that emp stars should have formed in gas of number densities @xmath39 @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "a more puzzling coincidence is why the end of the first - stars phase should occur at about the epochs corresponding to cosmological reionization .",
    "this points towards the possibility of strong feedback between intrahalo metal reincorporation timescales and halo - igm transport of ionizing radiation .",
    "we return to this issue in a subsequent work , where we will quantitatively relate the reionization epoch to the transition metallicity in early galaxies .",
    "clearly , emp stars provide an important window to study the transition from first- to second - generation star formation and the physical conditions at which this occurs in primordial galaxies .",
    "the novel result derived here is that the abundances in such stars show a strong relation to cosmological reionization .",
    "targetted observations are required with more uniform element coverage of emp stars , particularly the c - rich stars , in the critical range of -6 @xmath12 [ fe / h ] @xmath12 -4 .",
    "this range currently has very little data , and will be useful in closing the loop in our understanding of these important cosmic events at high redshifts .",
