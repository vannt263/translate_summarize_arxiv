    "we find that the spin and valley dependent gap is renormalized by the phonons and that this renormalization depends strongly on temperature @xcite .",
    "consequently the berry curvature will be modified and the topological quantum numbers are not well protected .",
    "for example , as we increase temperature , the gap can close and reopen and as found by garate @xcite the system can crossover from a band to a topological insulator .",

    "nevertheless our assignment of chern numbers to various phases treating the gap as if it were effectively a zero temperature value , provides considerable insight into the origin of the complex variation of spin and valley hall conductivity seen in fig .",
    "the left frames include the electron - phonon renormalization while the right frames do not and are for comparison .",
    "the top frames give the spin hall and the lower frames give the valley hall dc conductivity .",
    "we first note that in our units , the spin hall conductivity at t=0 is quantized and takes on the value zero for the larger values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the region of smaller @xmath96 . with a discontinuous crossover at @xmath16 .",

    "the sign of the spin hall conductivity remains unchanged , while there can be sign changes when it is included .",
    "the region of small @xmath17 is particularly interesting as we go from a topological insulator with effective chern spin hall number -1 to + 1 by increasing t. the spin hall conductivity goes from a negative at @xmath99 to a positive value at @xmath100 and this change in sign is taken as an indication of a topological crossover .",
    "it occurs only when the zero frequency value of the gap @xmath56 changes sign with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "this can never occur in a bare band picture and is a result of the electron - phonon renormalizations which become larger with increasing temperature and have the opposite sign to the bare gap @xmath101 .",
    "note that for a given valley the renormalized gap must be positive for one spin state and negative for the other so that both contributions add in the definition of the spin hall conductivity to give a non zero value . without a sign change",

    "considering first the imaginary part @xmath108 ( left frames ) we note that at low temperature @xmath71 bare ( solid ) and renormalized ( dotted ) results are not qualitatively different from each other .",
    "this is not the case at high temperatures .",
    "in particular for @xmath106 the sign associated with red ( @xmath109 ) and black ( @xmath110 ) curves is no longer the same .",
    "this arises because the sign of the renormalized results has reversed while that of the bare band results is unaltered .",
    "this shows once more how phonons can introduce temperature variation in the conductivity not part of bare band calculations . for @xmath100",
    "the situation is even more complex with renormalized conductivity crossing at @xmath111  30mev ( dotted curves ) .",
    "turning next to the real part of the spin hall conductivity ( @xmath112 ) shown on the right in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we note again that renormalized ( dotted ) and bare band ( solid ) results agree qualitatively at low t but that this changes as t increases .",

    "[ fig3 ] . at low temperature bare and renormalized value",
    "agree while at higher t they in fact carry opposite sign as has been emphasized in constructing the color plots of fig .",
    "another consequence of the phonon renormalization of the effective gap is the change it can induce in the valley hall optical selection rule for circularly polarized light . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show results for the frequency dependence of @xmath114 vs. @xmath115 in units of @xmath116 at @xmath117 ( upper panel ) and at @xmath77 ( lower panel ) .",

    "both show significant absorption above the main absorption edge determined by the effective low temperature gap .",
    "by contrast the black curves give @xmath119 and show that for this valley @xmath78 , there is comparatively little absorption of the left handed polarized light .",
    "this selection rule can be reversed by increasing temperature through a change in the sign of the effective gap brought about by the coupling to phonons as seen in the lower frame for @xmath77 .",
    "this temperature is sufficiently large and the gap small enough that no absorption threshold can now be seen but it is clear that the left handed light is now more strongly absorbed than the right handed light .",
    "finally we note sharp phonon structures at energies ( @xmath120 ) at low temperature .",
    "of course once the sum over the two valleys @xmath121 is carried out these effects average out . however including a valley symmetry breaking term to our hamiltonian ( 1 ) would allow the effect to be seen directly in optics .",
    "coupling of dirac fermions to a phonon field can change the sign of their effective gap with increasing temperature .",
    "this leads to a rich set of crossovers from topological to band insulators with recognizable imprints in their dc spin hall and valley hall conductivity .",
    "it also leads to a switch with increasing temperature in the polarization from right to left handedness of the dominantly absorbed light by a given valley .",
