    "the combined maxima-1 @xcite , boomerang @xcite , dasi @xcite and cobe / dmr cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations @xcite imply that the universe is flat @xcite and that most of the matter in the universe is dark @xcite , i.e. exotic .",
    "these results have been confirmed and improved by the recent wmap data @xcite . combining the data",
    "one finds : @xmath1 since any  invisible \" non exotic component can not possibly exceed @xmath2 of the above @xmath3  @xcite , exotic ( non baryonic ) matter is required , i.e. there is room cold dark matter candidates or wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) .    even though there exists firm indirect evidence for a halo of dark matter in galaxies from the observed rotational curves ,",
    "see e.g. the review @xcite , it is essential to directly detect such matter . the possibility of such detection , however , depends on the nature of the dark matter constituents and their interactions . since the wimp s",
    "are expected to be extremely non relativistic , with average kinetic energy @xmath4 , they are not likely to excite the nucleus , even if they are quite massive @xmath5 gev . therefore they can be directly detected mainly via the recoiling of a nucleus ( a , z ) in elastic scattering .",
    "the event rate for such a process can be computed from the following ingredients : i ) an effective lagrangian at the elementary particle ( quark ) level obtained in the framework of the prevailing particle theory .",
    "the most popular scenario is in the context of supersymmetry . here",
    "the dark matter candidate is the lsp ( lightest supersymmetric particle ) @xcite . in this case",
    "the effective lagrangian is constructed as described , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite . at least till supersymmetry is discovered in the laboratory ( lhc ) , other approaches are also possible , such as , e.g. , technibaryon @xcite , mirror matter @xcite , kaluza - klein models with universal extra dimensions @xcite ii ) a well defined procedure for transforming the amplitude obtained using the previous effective lagrangian , from the quark to the nucleon level . to achieve",
    "this one needs a quark model for the nucleon , for the coherent mode see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "similar effects occur in the case of the spin induced matrix elements , iii ) knowledge of the relevant nuclear matrix elements @xcite , obtained with as reliable as possible many body nuclear wave functions , iv ) knowledge of the wimp density in our vicinity and its velocity distribution . in the standard nuclear recoil experiments ,",
    "first proposed more than 30 years ago @xcite , one has to face the problem that the reaction of interest does not have a characteristic feature to distinguish it from the background .",
    "so for the expected low counting rates the background is a formidable problem . some special features of the wimp - nuclear interaction can be exploited to reduce the background problems , such as the modulation effect @xcite,@xcite and backward - forward asymmetry expected in directional experiments , i.e. experiments in which the direction of the recoiling nucleus is also observed @xcite@xcite .",
    "there exists a plethora of direct dark matter experiments with the task of detecting wimp event rates for a variety of targets such as those employed in xenon10 @xcite , xenon100 @xcite , xmass @xcite , zeplin @xcite , panda - x @xcite , lux @xcite , cdms @xcite , cogent @xcite , edelweiss @xcite , dama @xcite , kims @xcite and picasso @xcite .    for the interpretation of the experimental data , knowledge of the nuclear matrix elements",
    "is essential . in connection with nuclear structure aspects , in a series of calculations ,",
    "e.g. in @xcite and references therein , it has been shown that for the coherent contribution , due to the scalar interaction , the inclusion of the nuclear form factor is important , especially in the case of relatively heavy targets .",
    "they also showed that the nuclear spin cross sections , which may be relevant for odd mass targets , are characterized by a single , i.e. essentially isospin independent , structure function and two static spin values , one for the proton and one for the neutron , which depend on the target .",
    "in the present paper we will focus on the evaluation of the spin induced matrix elements .",
    "in particular we will explore the currents for spin - dependent wimp scattering off nuclei , in particular the most isovector channel .",
    "we will examine i ) the modification of the rates at the one - body level by including a suitable nucleon form factor , which modifies somewhat the universality of the suitably normalized spin isospin structure functions and ii ) include the leading long - range two - body currents , which are predicted in chiral eft @xcite .",
    "we will show that the two body effects lead to a quenching of the isospin one spin matrix elements .",
    "since , however the resulting quenching factor is independent of the target , it can be absorbed into the corresponding nucleon cross section .",
    "we have not examined such effects on the isoscalar spin matrix element since this mode , if present at all , is suppressed due to the quark structure of the nucleon .",
    "the expressions involving the differential are fairly well known ( see e.g. @xcite for a brief review in our notation ) . for the reader",
    "s convenience we will list the main features here . the event rate can be cast in the form : .|_a=.|_a+.|_a where the first term represents the time averaged ( non modulated ) differential event rate , while the second gives the time dependent ( modulated ) one due to the motion of the earth ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore for the coherent mode we get : .|_a&= & ( ) ^2 _ a^. ( ) | _ , + .|_a&= & ( ) ^2 _ a^. ( ) | _ , [ drdu ] while for the spin dependent process we get : .|_a&= & ( ) ^2 _ a^. ( ) | _ , + .|_a&= & ( ) ^2 _ a^. ( ) | _ [ drdus ] in the above expressions @xmath6 ( @xmath7 )",
