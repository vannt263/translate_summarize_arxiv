    "the models described by the schrdinger operators with singular zero - range potentials have widely been discussed in both the physical and mathematical literature ( see books  @xcite for details and references ) .",
    "these models admit exact closed analytical solutions which describe realistic situations using different approximations via hamiltonians describing point interactions @xcite . currently , because of the rapid progress in fabricating nanoscale quantum devices , of particular importance is the point modelling of different structures like quantum waveguides @xcite , spectral filters @xcite or infinitesimally thin sheets @xcite .",
    "a whole body of literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite , a few to mention ) , including the very recent studies @xcite with references therein , has been published where the one - dimensional schrdinger operators with potentials given in the form of distributions are shown to exhibit a number of peculiar features with possible applications to quantum physics .",
    "a detailed list of references on this subject can also be found in the recent review @xcite . on the other hand , using some particular regular approximations of the potential expressed in the form of the derivative of dirac s delta function , a number of interesting resonance properties of quantum particles tunnelling through this point potential has been observed @xcite .",
    "particularly , it was found that at some values of the potential strength of the @xmath16-potential the transmission across this barrier is non - zero , whereas outside these values the barrier is fully opaque . in general terms , the existence of such resonance sets in the space of potential intensities has rigorously been established for a whole class of approximations of the derivative delta potential by golovaty with coworkers @xcite .",
    "this type of point interactions may be referred to as ` resonant - tunnelling @xmath16-potentials ' .",
    "these results differ from those obtained within kurasov s theory @xcite which was developed for the distributions defined on the space of functions discontinuous at the point of singularity . here",
    "the limit point interaction is also called a @xmath16-potential .",
    "the common feature of kurasov s point potential and a resonant - tunnelling @xmath16-potential is that the transmission matrices of both these interactions are of the diagonal form , but the elements of these matrices are different .",
    "it is of interest therefore to find a way where it would be possible to describe both these types in a unique regularization scheme starting from the same initial regularized potential profile .    in the present work",
    "we address the problem on the relation between the point interactions realized within kurasov s theory and the resonant - tunnelling @xmath16-potentials studied in @xcite .",
    "we show that kurasov s @xmath16-potential emerges from the realistic heterostructure consisting of two or three extremely thin parallel plane layers separated by some distance .",
    "this system is studied in the limit as both the width of layers and the distance between them simultaneously tend to zero .",
    "in such a squeezing limit , the limit one - point interactions are proved to depend crucially on relative approaching zero the width and the distance . as a result , different types of one - point interactions appear in this limit depending on the way of convergence .",
    "surprisingly , within the same regularization scheme , it is possible to realize both the kurasov @xmath16-potential and the @xmath17-potentials with countable sets in the @xmath18-space at which a non - zero resonant tunnelling occurs .",
    "another surprising point is that the @xmath0-potential discovered by eba in @xcite can also be realized together with its countable splitting at some critical point .",
    "consider the system consisting of @xmath19 parallel sheets arranged successively with their planes perpendicular to the @xmath20-axis .",
    "the sheets are assumed to be homogeneous , so that one can explore the one - dimensional stationary schrdinger equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the wavefunction and @xmath23 the energy of a particle .",
    "the potential @xmath24 with a squeezing parameter @xmath25 shrinks to one point , say @xmath26 , as @xmath1 .",
    "one of the ways to realize limit point interactions is to choose the potential @xmath24 in the form of a sum of several dirac s delta functions as @xcite @xmath27 where the constants @xmath28 and the distances between the @xmath0-functions @xmath29 tend to zero as @xmath1 .",
    "the particular case of the three - delta ( @xmath30 ) spatially symmetric potential ( [ 2 ] ) , in the squeezing limit has been studied by cheon and shigehara @xcite , and albeverio and nizhnik @xcite . in this limit",
    "a whole four - parameter family of point interactions has been constructed , independently on whether or not potential ( [ 2 ] ) has a distributional limit .",
    "here we follow the approach developed by exner , neidhardt and zagrebnov @xcite , who have approximated the @xmath0-potentials by regular functions and constructed a one - point @xmath16-interaction . in particular",
    ", they have proved that the limit takes place if the distances between the ` centers ' of regularized potentials tend to zero sufficiently slow relatively to shrinking the @xmath0-approximating potentials .",
    "a similar research @xcite concerns about the convergence of regularized @xmath0-approximating structures to point potentials in higher dimensions .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the two cases when potential ( [ 2 ] ) consists of two ( @xmath31 ) and three ( @xmath30 ) @xmath0-potentials separated equidistantly by a distance @xmath32 that tends to zero as @xmath1 .",
    "the transmission matrices for the two- and three - delta potentials are the products @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , where ( @xmath4 ) @xmath35 we restrict ourselves to the most simple approximation of the @xmath0-potentials by piecewise constant functions resulting in a three- ( for @xmath31 ) and a five- ( for @xmath30 ) layered potential profile . in the limit as both the width of @xmath0-approximating functions and",
    "the distance between them tends to zero simultaneously we obtain different families of one - point interactions .",
    "we observe that , starting from the same profile of the three- and five - layered structure that approximates potential ( [ 2 ] ) , the limit point interactions crucially depend on the relative rate of tending the width of layers and the distance between them to zero .",
    "we follow the notations and the classification of one - point interactions given by brasche and nizhnik @xcite .",
    "thus , we denote @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary parameter ( this is a generalization of the generally accepted case with @xmath38 , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then the @xmath0-interaction , or @xmath0-potential , with intensity @xmath39 is defined by the boundary conditions @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so that the @xmath42-matrix in this case has the form @xmath43 the dual interaction is called a @xmath16-interaction ( the notation has been suggested in @xcite and adopted in the literature ) .",
    "this point interaction with intensity @xmath44 defined by the boundary conditions @xmath45 and @xmath46 has the @xmath42-matrix of the form @xmath47 as follows from formulae ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) , the usage of the parameter @xmath48 for both the @xmath0- and @xmath16-interactions does not play any role .",
    "however , for the @xmath16-potential with intensity @xmath49 the potential part in equation ( [ 1 ] ) is given by @xmath50 where the wavefunction @xmath22 must be discontinuous at @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , due to the ambiguity of the product @xmath52 , one can suppose the following generalized ( asymmetric ) averaging in the form @xmath53\\delta'(x)+",
    "\\left [ \\eta \\psi'(-0 ) + ( 1-\\eta ) \\psi'(+0)\\right ] \\delta(x ) .",
    "\\label{7}\\ ] ] this suggestion is also motivated by the studies @xcite which demonstrate that the plausible averaging with @xmath38 at the point of singularity in general does not work .",
    "the @xmath16-potential with intensity @xmath49 is defined by the boundary conditions @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "an equivalent form of these conditions is given by the @xmath42-matrix in the diagonal form @xmath56 with @xmath57 / ( 1-\\eta \\gamma)$ ] .    finally , instead of the fourth type of point interactions defined in @xcite as @xmath0-magnetic potentials , in this paper we shall be dealing with potentials which at some ( resonant ) values of intensities are fully transparent , whereas outside these values they are completely opaque satisfying the dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath58 .",
    "at the resonance sets the boundary conditions are given by one of the unit matrices @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "let us approximate the @xmath0-potentials in ( [ 2 ] ) by piecewise constant functions .",

    "in this paper , the system consisting of two or three @xmath0-potentials ( with intensities @xmath3 , @xmath157 if @xmath31 and @xmath4 if @xmath30 ) has been approximated in the most simple way , namely by piecewise constant functions and then the convergence of the corresponding transmission matrices has been studied in the squeezing limit as both the width of @xmath0-approximating functions @xmath74 and the distance between them @xmath75 tend to zero . the admissible rates of shrinking the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 have been controlled through power parameterization ( [ 21 ] ) , involving the two powers @xmath121 and @xmath122 as well as the squeezing parameter @xmath1 . for convenience of the presentation , we have used the diagram of admissible values for @xmath121 and @xmath122 plotted in figure  [ f1_17 ] . using this parameterization as well as the piecewise constant approximation of the @xmath0-functions in potential ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath263 , it was possible to get the explicit expressions for the corresponding @xmath42-matrices and to treat thus the reflection - transmission properties of the one - point interactions directly .    starting from the same three - layer ( for @xmath31 ) and five - layer ( for @xmath30 ) potential profile given by ( [ 9 ] ) , a whole family of limit one - point interactions with resonant - tunnelling behaviour has been realized . for the interactions realized at the line @xmath161",
