    "we have also considered the time dependent electron transport in the doublet blockade regime .",

    "a role of the leakage processes from the doublet to two electron states has been studied as well . for the triplet case",
    "the leakage is larger than for singlet due to activation of the quadruplet state .",
    "we have also presented the driven case where the mixing parameter between the doublet state is time dependent @xmath281 . in the resonance condition",
    "@xmath196 the doublet blockade is partially removed and one can observe strong rabi oscillations .",
    "moreover we have investigated mixing of the doublet subspaces with @xmath11 and @xmath239 caused by the spin - flip processes in the electrodes .",
    "the total mixing time @xmath280 is very long what is promising for manipulation and read - out of the qubit .",
