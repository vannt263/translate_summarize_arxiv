    "in 1998 watts and strogatz introduced in a seminal paper small world networks and provided a simple model of such graphs @xcite .",
    "the key property of small world graphs is the simultaneous presence of small diameter ( at most logarithmic in the vertex size ) and high clustering coefficient .",
    "extensive investigations over the last decade of real networks like the worldwideweb , citation networks , friendship networks and many others have shown that these graphs are really of small world type .",
    "but there is a second remarkable property shared by most real networks namely that they have a power law like fat tail distribution ( see @xcite for an excellent recent survey about the whole subject ) .",
    "there are many models which produce graphs with small diameter and power law distribution .",
    "if additionally local search rules are incorporated one easily obtains high clustering as well .",
    "but up to now it was common believe that for the small diameter property a certain amount of essentially independent random edge formations like in classical random graphs where necessary . to obtain a scale free distribution for the degree the basic conviction was that the random edge formation should be biased according to the `` the richer you are the richer you get- principle '' @xcite where richness is just measured by the degree of a vertex . in the present paper",
    "we will present a model which shows that even by entirely local edge formation rules without preferential choices graphs are obtainable which admit all the three above mentioned properties .",
    "the results are entirely based on numerical simulations since an analytic treatment of the model seems to be rather difficult .",
    "nevertheless we hope to present in a forthcoming paper a more theoretical study of the main properties .",
    "looking at the edge formation process in social networks there are essential two ways to get a new contact . first by the random event of meeting somebody for instance in a train or airplane .",
    "humans refer to this kind of relation creation often as fate .",
    "second there are contacts which where created by the local rule `` let me introduce you to one of my friends '' , certainly a very common process in real life . in the language of graphs this translates to the formation of an edge between two vertices",
    "say @xmath0 and @xmath1 which had distance 2 with respect to the underlying graph metric and we refer to this    kind of edge formation as the `` my friends are your friends '' principle ( ffp ) .",
    "graphs which where partially build by using the ff - principle are already described and analyzed in @xcite . in the following we want to describe a model based on the iteration of this principle - the iff - model . a typical example of an essential ff - graph (",
    "although a directed one and with increasing number of vertices ) is the citation network .",
    "in detail , we want to discuss the following model of a time dependent random graph space @xmath2 with @xmath3 vertices and an explicit integer parameter @xmath4 tuning the total number of edges .",
    "we start with a circular chain of @xmath3 vertices with the usual nearest neighbor edges , i.e. vertex @xmath5 is connected to vertex @xmath3 and @xmath6 , vertex @xmath6 is connected to vertex @xmath5 and @xmath7 and so on .",
    "we call this configuration a circle and refer to the corresponding edges as fixed base edges .",
    "the random graph space @xmath2 will be defined through the following algorithm : in each of the first @xmath4 time - steps , a vertex say @xmath0 is chosen randomly . from the set of neighbors @xmath8 of this vertex ( at the given time @xmath9 ) one element",
    "say @xmath1 is chosen randomly and then randomly from @xmath10  the neighbor set of @xmath1 at time @xmath9 with the exclusion of @xmath0  another element say @xmath11 .",
    "if there was no edge between @xmath11 and @xmath0 a new one is created between the two vertices otherwise nothing happens . in the first case",
    "we say that @xmath0 has created an ff - edge to @xmath12 respectively @xmath11 was chosen by @xmath0 . after repeating @xmath4 times",
    "the above procedure one continues for @xmath13 the same way with the additional rule that whenever a vertex say @xmath0 has created a new ff - edge randomly an ff - edge containing @xmath0 is deleted .",
    "note that the total number of edges stays therefore constant for @xmath14      the first surprising observation is the collapse of the diameter from @xmath15 to @xmath16 for sufficiently large @xmath9 , @xmath4 and typical elements of @xmath2 .",
    "this happens despite the fact that only local edge formations where used .",
    "[ fig_1 ] shows the diameter versus @xmath9 for different @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "our simulations indicate that in the case @xmath17 one gets an asymptotic regime in which the diameter is very small and shows no strong dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "[ tab_1 ] shows for three choices of @xmath18 the mean diameter @xmath19 in the asymptotic regime .",
    "the diameter @xmath20 is approximately proportional to @xmath21 which is one of the characteristics of small world graphs . in the case",
    "@xmath22 an asymptotic regime with still small diameter but large fluctuations starts approximately at @xmath23 .",
    "note that this value is much bigger than the collapse time in the cases @xmath24 .",
    "it seems that @xmath18 @xmath25 is just the borderline where a collapse of the diameter appears .",
    "this corresponds to the case where the mean number of non - base edges equals @xmath3 . for smaller values of @xmath4 we found the diameter to stay of order @xmath26 with an almost linear function @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "this indicates an interesting phase transition in the total number of edges reminiscent to the famous phase transition in the size of the largest component in classical random graph spaces like the @xmath28  the space of all graphs with @xmath3 vertices and @xmath29 edges equipped with the uniform probability measure .    ;",
