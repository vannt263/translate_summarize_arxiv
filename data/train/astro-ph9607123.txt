    "rapidly rotating neutron stars are highly relativistic objects , and , provided there is some physical process operative , which induces a significant deviation from axisymmetry , may be important sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "a transition toward triaxial configurations can occur , when the ratio @xmath3 of rotational kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy reaches some critical value@xmath4 .",
    "the equation of state , hereafter eos , has an important influence on the development of a triaxial instability since the neutron star matter must be stiff enough to admit a maximum angular velocity @xmath5 higher than the critical one .",
    "homogeneous , incompressible fluid bodies , rotating at moderate constant angular velocity , take the shape of some oblate axisymmetric _",
    "maclaurin spheroid_. maclaurin spheroids are dynamically unstable for @xmath6 , but there are two other families of triaxial ellipsoids which bifurcate from the maclaurin sequence earlier at @xmath7 .",
    "we focus on the sequence of _ jacobi ellipsoids _ which rotate uniformly about their smallest axis in an inertial frame .",
    "the evolution toward a jacobi ellipsoid at the bifurcation point is triggered by some _ viscous _ dissipative mechanism .",
    "this instability is called a _ secular _ one , because it evolves on the associated viscous timescale which is much longer than the dynamical one .",
    "the astrophysical realization corresponds to the scenario of a cold highly viscous binary neutron star , being spun up by accretion from its companion .",
    "viscosity dissipates mechanical energy , while it preserves angular momentum . as a consequence , the maclaurin spheroid , once the instability point is reached , develops toward a jacobi ellipsoid which exhibits the lowest rotational kinetic energy for a fixed value of the angular momentum . in this final state ,",
    "viscous dissipation has ceased , and the star is rotating rigidly .",
    "former studies had been performed at the newtonian@xmath8 or post  newtonian@xmath9 level which is by no means adequate for highly relativistic objects like neutron stars .",
    "furthermore , the neutron star matter was modeled by a simplifying polytropic equation of state .",
    "before the symmetry breaking sets in , the neutron star , modeled as a rigidly rotating perfect fluid , can be considered as _ stationary _ and _ axisymmetric_. making the further assumption that no _ meridional _ matter currents are present , a favourable choice of _ elliptic _ field equations was given by bonazzola et al.@xmath10 .",
    "the numerical code@xmath10 , based upon these equations , relies on a spectral method , and allows to compute neutron star models with a precision of @xmath11 in the spherical symmetric case and @xmath12 for maximum rotation configurations , when a @xmath13 polytropic , _ analytic _ eos is used , as well as @xmath14 for realistic eos@xmath15 .",
    "the neutron star models are _ `` exact '' _ in the sense that the full einstein equations are solved without any analytic approximation , while the numerical integration covers all space and respects the exact flat space boundary condition at spatial infinity .",
    "when the symmetry breaking occurs , spacetime is neither stationary nor axisymmetric .",
    "however , at the very beginning , the deviation from axisymmetry is sufficiently small , and the emitted gravitational radiation may be neglected . under the additional assumption of _ rigid _ rotation , the _ helical _ symmetry of spacetime is preserved . taking into account only the dominant non  axisymmetric terms , one basically recovers the original equations of the axisymmetric case@xmath16 .",
    "the only difference is that the lapse function @xmath17  its logarithm @xmath18 reduces to the newtonian potential in the weak field approximation  and the matter fields are three  dimensional quantities which depend on @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the angular velocity of the star . as a consequence , the present approach is exact for the stationary and axisymmetric relativistic , as well as for the fully three ",
    "dimensional newtonian case .",
    "after relaxation to a particular axisymmetric configuration , a small perturbation @xmath23 , which excites the @xmath24 , @xmath25 bar mode , is added to @xmath18 , and the growth of @xmath26 during the subsequent relaxation is followed .",
    "@xmath27 denotes the central log  enthalpy , and @xmath28 is a small parameter of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "a particular configuration is _ secularly unstable _ if the perturbation increases , and the fluid body evolves subsequently toward a triaxial spheroid .",
    "it is _ conditionally secularly stable _ if the perturbation tends to zero . in this case , however , three  dimensional terms of higher relativistic order , which have not been taken into account at the present level of approximation , may induce the symmetry breaking .",
    "-5 mm        the investigation of the symmetry breaking of relativistic polytropic stars avoids the problems associated with the use of realistic dense matter eos@xmath15 , and allowed us to perform some comparison with former results obtained for newtonian stars@xmath30 .",
    "in particular , we have confirmed james@xmath31 value @xmath0 of the critical polytropic index , where secular instability sets in at maximum angular velocity , as well as the asymptotic ratio @xmath32 .",
    "no results in the fully relativistic regime had been reported so far . in the newtonian case ,",
    "polytropic stars obey a scaling law , and the critical polytropic index is a global constant .",
    "relativistic effects , however , are supposed to influence the symmetry breaking .",
    "[ fig : gcrit - nc ] shows the dependence of @xmath1 on the central value of the lapse function @xmath33 which is an appropriate signature of the relativistic character of the star . after a very slight decrease in the weakly relativistic regime it grows by about @xmath34 for strongly relativistic configurations .",
    "one concludes furthermore that _ any _ neutron star , built upon a polytropic eos and stable against radial perturbations , becomes secularly unstable for @xmath35 at some critical angular velocity @xmath36 .",
    "the results for twelve realistic eos of neutron star matter are presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : res - eos ] . a description of each eos can be found in salgado et al.@xmath15 , where they had already been employed to construct realistic high precision neutron star models .",
    "six equations turn out to be stable up to the mass  shedding limit @xmath5 .",
    "only the stiffest ones allow for the symmetry breaking .",
    "the correlation with the corresponding maximum mass is not strict because of the density dependence of the eos .",
    "this is notably the case for the wgw eos which is the stiffest one at moderate densities . for the present sample of realistic eos",
    ", @xmath37 has a lower bound of @xmath38 .",
    "this is a low value compared with maximum masses of rotating neutron stars built upon a stiff eos , e.g. in tab .",
    "[ tab : res - eos ] .",
    "unfortunately , the real distribution of neutron star masses is still quite uncertain .",
    "[ fig : nsmass ] shows the measured masses of 17 neutron stars , compiled by thorsett et al.@xmath39 , and yielding an estimate of the average neutron star mass of @xmath40 , as well as a recent mass measurement of psr j1012 + 5307 of @xmath41 .",
    "at least the masses of the two x  ray binary neutron stars 4u 170037 , vela x1 , and that of the radio pulsar psr j1012 + 5307 are well above our minimum mass of @xmath38 . if they prove to be valid after further reduction of the observational errors , we may expect a significant number of neutron stars susceptible of encountering the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "their observation would provide us with useful information about the generation of gravitational waves and constraints on real neutron star matter eos .",
