    "there are now four bursts displaying evidence of an emission line feature during the x  ray afterglow : grb 970508 ( piro et al . , 1999 ) ; grb 970828 ( yoshida et al . , 1999 ) ; grb 991216 ( piro et al . , 2000 , hereafter p2000 ) ;",
    "grb 000214 ( antonelli et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "these lines have been observed 840 hours after the burst explosion , have a large equivalenth width ( 0.52 kev ) and a flux of about @xmath5 erg @xmath6 s@xmath2 .",
    "given these properties , each iron atom has to produce at least 2000 line photons , in order not to exceed 0.1 @xmath4 mass of emitting iron , .",
    "fast recombination and ionization is therefore required .",
    "the line of grb991216 is resolved in the @xmath7 gratings , with a width @xmath8 ( p2000 ) .",
    "as discussed by lazzati et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the detection of the line implies the presence of a sizable fraction of a solar mass of iron concentrated in the vicinity of the grb site .",
    "this is naturally accounted for in the supranova scenario ( vietri & stella 1998 ) .",
    "* the size problem *  if the line is detected after @xmath9 from the burst , the line emitting material must be located within a distance @xmath10 given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the angle between the line emitting material and the line of sight at the grb site .",
    "this limit implies a large scattering optical depth : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , is the mean atomic weight of the material .    *",
    "the kinematic problem *  for a radial velocity of the remnant of @xmath15 cm s@xmath2 the time elapsed from the supernova ( sn ) is @xmath16 $ ] days .",
    "such short times implies that most of the @xmath17co nuclei ( and a fraction of the @xmath17ni nuclei ) have not yet decayed to @xmath17fe ( half  life of 77.3 and 6.08 days , respectively , see vietri et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "* line emission rate *  we can derive the photon line luminosity by estimating the volume @xmath18 effectively contributing to the line emission , and assuming a given iron mass . if the layer contributing to the emission has @xmath19 ( to avoid compton broadening ) , and in this layer @xmath20a few ( to efficiently absorb the continuum ) , we have @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the emitting surface . the line emission rate from @xmath18",
    "is then : @xmath23 where the _ total _ volume is @xmath24 ( slab or shell geometry ) .    *",
    "mass *  eq .  [ eq : ndot ] shows that the total iron mass must be a sizable fraction of a solar mass in order to give rise to the observed line photon luminosity of @xmath25  s@xmath2 .",
    "notice also that eq .",
    "[ eq : ndot ] establishes that the line emitting material must be a snr : no other known astrophysical object contains this iron mass .",
    "* the wide funnel *  consider a wide funnel excavated in a young plerionic remnant .",
    "this solves the _ size problem _ , since it extends to large radii but can maintain the time ",
    "delay contained because it is built close to the polar axis ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "fixing the line photon rate ( eq .",
    "3 ) yields @xmath26 cm , and thus an opening angle @xmath27 to fit the time  delay .",
    "assuming a cone geometry for simplicity , we can rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq : ndot ] as : @xmath28 this is a lower limit , since a parabolic funnel has a larger surface and we neglected the ( likely ) density stratification inside the remnant .",
    "consider now the kinematic properties of the funnel .",
    "we expect radiation pressure to exert a force parallel to the surface accelerating the layer with @xmath29 .",
    "the absorbed fluence @xmath30 accelerates the funnel layer to @xmath31  km  s@xmath2 if @xmath32  cm .",
    "@xmath33 is the angle between the funnel s normal and the incoming photons .",
    "thus , we expect ablation by radiation pressure to be able to propel the reflecting layer to velocities comparable to those seen in grb991216 .    * back illuminated equatorial material *  the model above assumes that a sn explosion preceded the grb by some months .",
    "we now explore the possibility of a simultaneous grb  sn explosion .",
    "assume that a grb ejects and accelerates a small amount of matter in a collimated cone , while a large amount of matter is instead ejected , at sub ",
    "relativistic speeds , along the progenitor s equator .",
    "massive star progenitors are inevitably surrounded by dense material produced by strong winds of mass loss rates @xmath34 and velocity @xmath35 .",
    "this wind scatters back a fraction of the photons produced by the bursts and its afterglow ( thompson & madau 2000 ) .",
    "the scattered luminosity @xmath36 is constant , since there is an equal number of electrons in a shell of constant width @xmath37 ( for a density profile @xmath38 ) .",
    "this luminosity is of order : @xmath39 scattered photons illuminate the expanding equatorial matter after a time @xmath40 , giving rise to the line emission . since in this case",
    "the sn and grb explosions are supposed to be simultaneous , the emitting iron must be produced directly by the sn and not through the nickel decay .",
    "iron ( @xmath41fe ) is directly synthesized for high neutronization of the material at the sn shock .",
    "the recently detected features in the x  ray afterglow of grbs impose strong constraints on models , the most severe being how to arrange a large amount of iron close to the grb site , while avoiding at the same time a large thomson scattering opacity .",
    "this limit applies to all bursts showing a line feature .",
    "an additional limit comes from the @xmath7 observation of a @xmath42 line in grb 991216 .",
    "these observations require a very large amount of iron , known to be contained only in sne .",
    "we have described two models .",
    "the  wide funnel \" model is in better agreement with observations : its geometry solves the size problem , and the acceleration of the line emitting material by grazing incident photons solves the kinematic problem , allowing the remnant to be a few months old ( enough for most cobalt to have decayed into iron ) .",
    "this model implies that the grb progenitors are massive stars exploded as sne some months before the burst , inundating the surroundings of the burst with iron rich material .",
    "this two  step process and the time  delay between the two steps are exactly what is predicted in the supranova scenario of vietri & stella ( 1998 ) .",
