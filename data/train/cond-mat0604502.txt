    "recently , two experimental groups observed the transverse opposite spin accumulations near two edges of their devices in the presence of a longitudinal voltage bias.@xcite one experiment is on n - type gaas s bar with a size about @xmath0,@xcite and the spin accumulation is detected by kerr rotation spectroscopy .",
    "the other experiment is on a coplanar p - n junction light - emitting diode device.@xcite under a longitudinal bias , a circular polarization of the emitting light on two edges is detected .",
    "the directions of the polarization are opposite on the two edges , which suggests opposite spin accumulation on the two edges . moreover ,",
    "when the bias is reversed , the spin accumulations are reversed in the above two experiments .",
    "these experiments originally were motivated to measure the predicted effects : the extrinsic and intrinsic spin hall effects ( she ) .",
    "the extrinsic she has been discovered about a few decades ago,@xcite and it originates from the spin dependent scattering that deflects the spin - up and spin - down carriers towards the opposite edges of a sample . the intrinsic she is predicted first by murakami _ et.al . _ and sinova _ et.al . _ in a luttinger spin - orbit ( so ) coupled 3d p - doped semiconductor@xcite and a rashba so coupled two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg)@xcite , respectively .",
    "recently , a number of sequent works have focused on this interesting effect.@xcite nonetheless , the intrinsic she still remains a controversy topic .",
    "the intrinsic spin hall conductivity originally was pointed out to be universal in the clean bulk sample.@xcite however some works have showed that the spin - hall conductivity depends on the so coupling strength and electron fermi energy in general.@xcite moreover , it has been shown recently that the impurity plays an important role on the intrinsic she . in an infinite system , it has been shown that the spin hall conductivity is very sensitive to disorder.@xcite the effect vanishes even in a very weak disorder limit when the vertex correction is considered . in a finite mesoscopic ballistic system ,",
    "the she can survive.@xcite the she and spin accumulations have been studied in the dirty or clean finite mesoscopic samples by using the landauer - bttiker formalism and the tight - binding hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "these works show that the opposite spin accumulations indeed can generate on the transverse two edges in the finite system , and the she still presents below a critical disorder threshold.@xcite    although the spin accumulation observed in the two experiments appears to reflect the physics of the she , there is still a significant challenge to explain the observed experiment effect .",
    "the spin accumulation contributed from the extrinsic she has been shown to have the directions of spin polarization that are opposite to the experimental results.@xcite while the intrinsic she is predicted to have the same directions of spin polarization as that observed in the experiments , it is expected to be scaled with length and eventually be vanished in rashba spin orbit coupling systems in the presence of disorder . since the experiments are not done in the ballistic region and the signal of spin accumulation has little dependence of the transversal length of the sample ,",
    "it is not clear that how the intrinsic she explains all experimental results solely .    in this paper",
    ", we give a new mechanism that can generate the opposite spin accumulations in two edges under the longitudinal voltage bias .",
    "we first show the principle of this new mechanism . considering an infinite zonal 2deg with a confining potential on @xmath1-direction , which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the momentum operator and @xmath5 is the effective mass of electrons .",
    "@xmath6 is the confining potential energy which is constant in the center and quickly increases as tending to the boundary .",
    "based on the relativity effect , in the presence of the internal electric field @xmath7 , there is a natural spin - orbit coupling term @xmath8.@xcite considering that the corresponding electric field @xmath7 is perpendicular to the edge , only the element @xmath9 of @xmath1-direction is non - zero and the spin - orbit coupling energy reduces into : @xmath10 .",
    "so for the spin - down ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) electrons , its effective potential @xmath13 is lower than the one of spin - up electrons at the edge of @xmath14 for positive @xmath15 ( see fig.1 ) . on the other hand , at the other edge of @xmath16 ,",
    "the effective potential @xmath17 of the spin - up electrons is lower for @xmath15 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "thus , the spin accumulations on the two transverse edges form when electrons occupy the positive @xmath15 states under the positive longitudinal bias . when the bias is reversed , the electrons occupy the negative @xmath18 state and the spin accumulation reverses its sign",
    ". therefore it produces the same spin accumulation as that observed in the experiments.@xcite in the present model , the spin accumulation originates completely from the structure confining potential , so it is not affected by the impurity and the dephase . in a word , the structure confining potential can also induce the opposite spin accumulation , which can be the origin of the experimentally observed spin accumulation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we will mention and solve the model in detail .",
    "the results and discussions are in section iii .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in section iv .",
    "the hamiltonian of the zonal 2deg can be written as : @xmath19 here the first term is kinetic energy , the second term is the potential energy , and the third term is from the spin - orbit coupling energy due to the boundary confining potential @xmath6 as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "due to the fact @xmath20=0 $ ] and @xmath21=0 $ ] , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the good quantum numbers , the eigenstates in such a structure can be written in the form @xmath24 with the dispersion relation @xmath25 .",
    "the index @xmath26 numbers the different subbands with the wave - function @xmath27 in the @xmath1-direction and a energy @xmath28 , which are functions of the wave vector @xmath22 .",
    "the transverse wave - function @xmath27 satisfies the equation : @xmath29   \\phi _ { nk_x}(y)=   \\epsilon_{nk_x } \\phi_{nk_x}(y),\\ ] ] where @xmath30 . in the experiment ,",
    "the length @xmath31 along the transverse @xmath1-direction is very long [ e.g. in the order of tens of micron in ref.(1 ) ] while the confining potential is only limited in several atom s layers .",
    "so we model this potential @xmath6 as a square potential well , i.e. @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for others @xmath1 . in this case , @xmath35 becomes the @xmath36-function .",
    "the hamiltonian can be solved analytically , and the schrdinger equation eq.([schro ] ) for the spin - up electron reduces into : @xmath37\\phi(y)=\\epsilon   \\phi(y ) .\\ ] ] the spin - down electronic schrdinger equation is same to eq.([up ] ) except @xmath38 .",
    "the wave function @xmath39 in eq.([up ] ) can be written as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the constants to be determined by the boundary conditions . here",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which lead to @xmath48 solving the equation set , we get @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "sequentially the spin - up electron probability distribution @xmath49 is obtained . the same calculation can be done for the spin - down electron . due to",
    "the system is universal along the @xmath50-direction , and the spin accumulation is independent of @xmath50 , @xmath51 completely describes spin distribution .",
    "although the square confining potential @xmath6 model is solvable analytically , the potential in the real system is not abrupt .",
    "an gradual change from bottom to top close to the interface is expected .",
    "for this reason , we consider the real parabolic confining potential @xmath6 and solve the system numerically by using the tight - binding hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "in addition , we also study the disorder effect on the spin accumulations . in the tight - binding approximation",
    ", the hamiltonian in eq.([schro ] ) , which is related to @xmath1-direction , can be written as the following discrete lattice version : @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) is the spin index in @xmath55-direction , and @xmath56 represents the hopping matrix element with the lattice constant @xmath57 .",
    "the confining potential @xmath6 is assumed to be parabolic : @xmath58 for @xmath59 , @xmath60 for @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for @xmath63 . for a clean system , the onsite energy @xmath64 , and @xmath65",
    "is randomly distributed between [ @xmath66 for the dirty system .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq.([hamil ] ) can easily be solved by numerically calculating the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the hamiltonian matrix . due to decoupling between the different spin states in the hamiltonian",
    ", we can solve the eigenvalues and eigen - wavefunctions separately for the spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "whereafter , the the spin - up and spin - down electron probability distribution @xmath67 in the subband @xmath26 and the longitudinal momentum @xmath68 is obtained straightforwardly .    while the longitudinal bias is zero , the spin accumulations @xmath69 is zero everywhere , because of the existence of the time - reversal invariance . on the other hand ,",
    "when a bias @xmath70 is added , the spin accumulations @xmath69 will emerge .",
    "consider the device under the positive bias @xmath70 and at the zero temperature , the @xmath71 states with its energy between @xmath72 and @xmath73 are occupied by electrons , while the states for the negative @xmath74 are empty , here @xmath75 is the fermi energy .",
    "then , under the small bias and taking the linear approximation , the spatial density distribution @xmath76 of the spin - up ( down ) electrons along @xmath1-direction for the unit bias is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the density of state in the subbands @xmath26 with @xmath79 , and",
    "the sum is over all subbands @xmath26 with its cut - off energy lower than @xmath75 .",
    "the spin accumulation density and charge density in the linear bias can be obtained as : @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    in the numerical calculation",
    ", we choose the realistic parameters as ones in the experiment:@xcite the electronic effective mass @xmath82 and the fermi energy @xmath83 , in which the corresponding electron concentration is approximately @xmath84 .",
    "the energy unit is set to @xmath85 , and the length unit is @xmath86 for the analytic model , or @xmath87 for the tight - banding model . the lattice constant @xmath57 in the tight - banding model is around @xmath88 .",
    "first , we study spin accumulation in the clean system . in the present system ,",
    "the spin accumulation density @xmath89 depends on the transverse position @xmath1 , and it is independent of the longitudinal position @xmath50 .",
    "fig.2 and fig.3 show the spin accumulation density @xmath89 and charge density @xmath90 versus @xmath1 for the case of the square and the parabolic confining potential @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "first of all , the opposite spin accumulations at @xmath55-direction indeed are generated near the two edges regardless of the square or the parabolic potential .",
    "if the bias is reversed , the electrons occupy the negative @xmath74 states instead of the positive @xmath71 states and the spin accumulations also are reversed .",
    "these results are consistent with the experimental results.@xcite the opposite spin accumulations here obviously originates from the confining potential as mentioned in the introduction because there is no other interaction except for the potential @xmath6 .",
    "second , the spin accumulations mainly are near the two edges , and it is small and has oscillation in the bulk .",
    "the oscillation is expected due to the existence of fermi surface .",
    "the period is given by @xmath91 .",
    "for a fixed fermi energy ( e.g. @xmath92 ) , the wider the width @xmath31 is , the more the subbands below @xmath75 will be . at the mean time , the oscillation times of @xmath93 and @xmath94 are more and the oscillation amplitude are smaller .",
    "so the bulk @xmath93 almost vanishes and @xmath94 approaches constant at large @xmath31 .",
    "but the spin accumulations near the edge , including the intensity and the location , is almost independent with @xmath31 .",
    "third , we discuss the characters of the spin accumulations @xmath89 as a function of the strength @xmath95 of the confining potential @xmath6 .",
    "the characters are slightly different for the square and parabolic potentials . while @xmath96 , @xmath97 for both the square and parabolic potentials . with @xmath95 increasing ,",
    "@xmath89 emerges .",
    "for the square potential , @xmath89 quickly arises in the beginning . around @xmath98 , @xmath89",
    "has reached saturated value .",
    "thereafter the value almost does not change with further increasing @xmath95 ( see fig.2a , b ) . for the parabolic potential , @xmath89 increases slowly .",
    "around @xmath99 , it saturates . for comparison",
    ", we also show the charge density @xmath90 in fig.2 and fig.3 . here",
    "@xmath100 in any position @xmath1 , and @xmath90 is symmetric while @xmath89 is asymmetric .",
    "next , we discuss the spin polarization @xmath101 . in the central panel of fig.4 and fig.5",
    ", we plot the transverse distribution of the spin polarization for the square and parabolic confining potential @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "it is clearly shown that the opposite spin polarization emerges on the transverse two edges whatever @xmath31 is set .",
    "for example , in the fig.4 and 5 , the transverse width @xmath31 is set to @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 which is very different , but the spin polarization distributions near the edge are almost identical .",
    "in addition , the spin polarization on the transverse edge is close to a linear function as @xmath95 while @xmath89 is hardly affected by the strength of @xmath95 ( see fig.2 and 3 ) .",
    "the detailed distributions of the spin polarization near the edge of @xmath14 are magnified and shown in the insets ( in fig.4 and 5 ) .",
    "the distribution range for the parabolic potential is slightly wider than that for the square potential because the variation range of the parabolic potential @xmath6 is wider than that of the square potential @xmath6 .",
    "the above result is obtained in a clean system . in the following ,",
    "we study the spin accumulation in the dirty system .",
    "fig.6 displays the transverse distribution of @xmath89 , @xmath90 and spin polarization @xmath101 with different disorder strength @xmath106 . in these calculation , @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    "are obtained by averaging over up to 5000 realizations of disorder . from fig.6",
    ", we can see that the spin accumulation @xmath89 and the spin polarization near the two edges are almost unaffected by the disorder , even the disorder @xmath107 is very strong ( e.g. @xmath108 ) .",
    "in fact , the spin accumulation in the present device originates from the confining potential near the edge , where the effective potentials for spin - up and spin - down electrons are different ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "intuitively , the spin polarization is expected to be unaffected by the disorder as well as the dephase .",
    "additionally , with the increasing of the disorder @xmath107 , the amplitudes of the oscillation of @xmath90 and @xmath89 in the bulk are slightly reduced ( see fig.6a , b ) , and their fluctuations are increased linearly .    to compare our numerical results with the experiment @xcite , we calculate the value for spin polarization and accumulation . from the experimental data , the spin density at the peak",
    "can be estimated : @xmath109 , and the spin polarization is @xmath110 for a thickness @xmath111 . from figures ( e.g. fig.2 and fig.4 ) , our calculation show that the peak spin density @xmath112 and the spin polarization is @xmath113 .",
    "the value of the spin polarization is comparable with the experiment . due to the big thickness in the expriment ,",
    "the spin accumulation @xmath93 in our calculation seems to be several times smaller than that of the experiment .",
    "indeed , a more precise quantitative calculation perhaps requires to consider the spin orbit coupling in the bulk and spin relaxation effect at the boundary .",
    "however , our simple model indeed produces the same order of magnitude as one measured in the experiments .",
    "in summary , we propose a new mechanism to explain the spin accumulations at the edges of a zonal two dimensional electron system . due to the strong structure confining potential in the boundary , the induced spin - orbit interaction leads to the opposite spin accumulation on the two transverse edges under the longitudinal voltage bias .",
    "the spin polarized direction can be reversed while the bias is reversed .",
    "the intensity of the polarization is also proportional to the external longitudinal voltage bias .",
    "these results are consistent with the recent experiment .",
    "moreover , the experimental test of the new mechanism can be easily performed in future experiments . unlike the extrinsic and intrinsic she , the spin accumulations in the present mechanism are hardly affected by the disorder and dephase , and can exist even in the strong disorder system .",
