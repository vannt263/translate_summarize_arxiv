    "diffusion explains the net flux of particles moving from a region of higher concentration to the lower concentration , although diffusion process exists even when there is no macroscopic concentration gradient .",
    "diffusion is a fundmental transport mechanism in liquids and gasses and therefore measurement of diffusion constant is important for understanding many physical , chemical , and biochemical processes @xcite .",
    "the diffusion constant ( @xmath1 ) is described as the amount of a particular substance that diffuses across a unit area in unit time under the influence of a unit concentration gradient @xcite . according to the stokes - einstein theory , for a fluid with visocity @xmath2 at a temperature @xmath3 ,",
    "the diffusion constant is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the boltzman constant and @xmath6 is the stokes radius of the diffusing particle @xcite .",
    "the denominator in the above expression is termed as the friction coefficient .",

    "can be obtained by a refocussing @xmath7 pulse placed between two pfgs if the molecues do not change their place during the period @xmath8 .",
    "diffusion renders the molecules to change their place and therefore for a fixed duration @xmath8 , the echo amplitude decreases with the strength of the pfgs .",
    "such pfg methods are widely used for the measurement of diffusion constants and already numerous improved sequences are available @xcite .",
    "for example , replacing hahn - echo by stimulated - echo sequence reduces the decay due to transverse relaxation and results in enhanced echo amplitudes @xcite .",
    "application of long - lived singlet states allows one to study slow diffusion requiring long intervals ( @xmath8 ) between the pfgs @xcite .",
    "fast single - scan measurement of diffusion has also been demonstrated by realizing z - coordinate dependent pfg strengths using frequency swept refocusing pulses @xcite .    in this letter",

    "we propose to prepare the diffusing spin system into a noon state . although this method has similarities with the multiple - quantum method for studying diffusion @xcite , the current method differs in actual implementation and its scope .",
    "we briefly outline the theory in section 3 and we describe the experimental demonstration in section 4 .",
    "we shall follow the notations of quantum information theory where @xmath9 states of a spin 1/2 nuclues is represented by basis kets @xmath10 and @xmath11 of a quantum bit or a ` qubit ' .",
    "the noon state of an @xmath12-qubit system is a superposition of all the @xmath12 qubits being in state 0 with all those in state 1 : @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "recently several applications of noon states have been discovered @xcite .",
    "it has also been used for sensing weak magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the circuit for the preparation of noon state , shown in the first part of fig .",
    "[ nooncircuit ] , consists of a hadamard gate ( h ) and a cnot gate .",
    "this circuit acts on a quantum register with a single ` control ' qubit and a set of @xmath14 ` target ' qubits initialized in @xmath15 pure state @xmath16    preparing a pure noon state is out of bounds from a highly mixed thermal equilibrium state that is available in liquid state nmr systems at ordinary temperatures .",
    "however , it is rather easy to prepare a pseudopure noon state which is of the form @xmath17 where the scalar quantity @xmath18 is a measure of purity , which is of the order of @xmath19 in typical nmr setups @xcite .",
    "the identity part does not evolve under unitary dynamics neither does it give raise to nmr signals .",
    "therefore we ignore this part as a background and continue using ket notation @xmath20 for simplicity .",
    "the cnot implementation is particularly easier with a heteronuclear spin system of type am@xmath21 , wherein each m spin of the @xmath22 magnetically equivalent spins , is having an indirect spin - spin interaction with the common heteronuclear spin a with a coupling constant of , say @xmath23 hz .",
    "we shall use the single heteronucles as the ` control ' qubit and the rest as the ` target ' .",
    "such a system allows parallel implementation of cnot gate ( upto a global phase ) using the sequence @xmath24 @xcite . here",

    "[ hahndiff ] . for simplicity , we ignore decoherence and other experimental errors in the following analysis .",
    "the first gradient encodes the longitudinal distribution of the sample such that a spin in position @xmath35 gets a phase @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the spin and @xmath38 is the effective duration ( duration @xmath39 shape - factor ) of the gradient @xmath40 . under this gradient",
    "the pseudopure coherence @xmath41 ( ignoring the backgroud ) evolves to @xmath42 .",
    "after the central @xmath7 pulse flips the basis states the second gradient encodes another identical phase so that the resulting state becomes @xmath43 , up to a global phase .",
    "thus if the spin does not change the position there is no change in the relative phase .",
    "however if , during the period @xmath8 , the spin changes the position by an effective amount @xmath44 , the state after the second gradient will be @xmath45 , where the relative phase is @xmath46 .    due to the random molecular motion of a large number of spins each of which acquiring a different relative phase , the average hahn - echo does not acquire a net phase but diminishes in amplitude .",
    "theoretically , the decay of the hahn - echo signal @xmath47 can be given as , @xmath48 where @xmath1 is the diffusion constant , @xmath49 is the normalization factor , and @xmath50 is the correction to @xmath8 due to the finite durations @xmath38 of the pfgs @xcite .",
    "similar analysis can now be carried out for the noon state using the circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ nooncircuit ] . under the @xmath51 sequence , a spin system in noon state diffusing through a distance @xmath44 acquires a net relative phase and becomes @xmath52 .",
    "the relative phase acquired is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "the factor @xmath55 is also known as ` loopsidedness ' of the noon state .",
    "larger the value of @xmath55 , more sensitive is the noon state for the phase encoding . since noon state is a multiple quantum coherence it is necessary to convert it back to single quantum coherence before detection .",
    "this conversion can efficiently be carried out using a second cnot gate : @xmath56 thus the phase encoding due to the diffusion , i.e. , @xmath57 has been transfered to one transition of the control spin .",
    "however as explained before , for a large number of molecules undergoing diffusion , the above phase encoding results in the attenuation of the control transition . instead of starting with an initial pseudopure state , it is rather convenient to start with a thermal equilibrium state and use two pfgs g@xmath33 and g@xmath34 to select out the desired coherence pathway that is passing through the noon state .",
    "the ratio of these two pfgs are adjusted depending on the relative gyromagnetic ratio : @xmath58 .    in the case of large loopsidedness @xmath55",

    "the selection pfgs were adjusted such that g@xmath34/g@xmath33 = @xmath64 = @xmath65 , to select the 10-quantum coherence pathway . a two - step phase cycle of @xmath66 pulse of the first cnot along with the receiver phase helped to reduce artifact signals .",

    "[ expt]a . the diffusion constant , @xmath67 m@xmath68 s@xmath69 was obtained by fitting these data points to the gaussian expression given in ( [ sgz ] ) .",

    "[ nooncircuit ] .",
    "the main parameters of the experiment are shown in fig .",
    "the lopsidedness for this system is @xmath70 and accordingly the noon state experiment requires much shorter @xmath8 and @xmath38 values to reach similar attenuation of the echo signal as that of the single quantum experiment . in fig.[expt]b , the integrated intensity of the single transition , after the selection of noon - state coherence pathway , is plotted against g@xmath32 .",
    "the gaussian fit , again using the expression ( [ sgz ] ) , with @xmath71 lead to the diffusion constant @xmath72 m@xmath68 s@xmath69 .",
    "while the two methods gave identical values for the diffusion constant , the error - bar is slightly larger in the latter case due to the added complexity of the circuit , the imperfections in the selection of coherence pathway , reduced signal to noise , and due to the faster relaxation of the noon state . on the otherhand",
    ", the shorter timescales of the noon - state experiment suggests its possible applications in studying slow diffusion or studying diffusion with limited pfg strengths .     with ( a ) @xmath60h single quantum coherence and ( b ) noon state .",

    "we described the application of noon states in studying translational diffusion in liquids .",
    "although the basic principle is general , the method is particularly convenient in the presence of a set of magnetically equivalent nuclei interacting with a heteronucleus via j - coupling .",
    "we have demonstrated the experimental measurement of diffusion constant in trimethylphosphite , which is a @xmath73 spin system .",
    "both single - quantum and the noon - state experiments lead to identical values for the diffusion constant , but the error - bar was slightly larger in the latter case due to the additional complexities . however , the noon state experiment required weaker pair of pfgs and an order of magnitude shorter duration between them , indicating the possible applications in studying slow diffusion .",
    "the other available method for measurement of slow diffusion involves the use of long - lived singlet states @xcite , which requires a pair of weakly interacting homonuclear spins spatially isolated from the rest of the spins @xcite . in the current method we prepare a state that is highly sensitive to the gradient encoding of the z - coordinate and hence is able to capture the effects of diffusion even in shorter time - scales and with weaker pfgs .",
    "it might also be possible to combine the noon state technique with the single scan techniques to achieve ultra - fast diffusion measurements .",
