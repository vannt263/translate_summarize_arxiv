    "two of the outstanding experimental problems of the highly successful standard model ( sm ) is the existence of the non - zero neutrino masses and the dark matter .",
    "one can obtain non - zero neutrino masses in the sm from the effective dimension 5 operators @xcite ( weinberg operator , having the schematic structure of llhh , where l is a lepton doublet and h the higgs doublet ) , but if the planck scale is the next scale in the theory beyond the @xmath5 scale , then the neutrino masses comes out to few orders of magnitude smaller compared to the observed values .",
    "the scale needed is @xmath1 gev .",
    "if there are right handed ( rh ) sm singlet neutrinos at this scale , then such effective operators can be obtained by integrating out the heavy rh neutrinos . seesaw mechanism constructed by postulating such sm singlet rh neutrinos",
    "is the most elegant mechanism to explain these tiny neutrino masses .",
    "however , existence of such a heavy rh singlet neutrino can not be tested in any laboratory experiments , specially in the currently running high energy large hadron colliders ( lhc ) .",
    "also , fermion representation in the sm is very asymmetric , left handed ( lh ) fermions are doublets , whereas rh fermions are singlets .",
    "long ago , it was proposed that may be nature is more symmetric , there are similar heavy particle with exactly opposite chirality @xcite",
    ". however , such a simple extension is excluded by the currently available precision electroweak data , namely the s parameter .",
    "recently , a new mirror symmetric model has been proposed @xcite which rectifies the old lee - yang proposal by extending the higgs sector .",
    "the electroweak gauge symmetry is @xmath6 , and for every left - handed sm doublets , there are right handed sm doublets with new fermions . similarly for every rh sm singlet , we have new lh singlet fermions . these new fermions are called mirror fermions . the ew precision constraints , such as the s parameter is satisfied by extending the higgs sector to include @xmath7 triplet higgs .",
    "the @xmath8 symmetry is broken in the same electroweak scale , @xmath9 246 gev .",
    "all the particles get masses from the spontaneous symmetry breaking in this scale , will have masses less than a tev .",
    "notice also the marked difference with the left - right symmetric model @xcite which is characterized by an extra @xmath10 with right - handed fermions transforming as doublets under that new gauge group .",
    "furthermore , the l - r model contains _ two _ symmetry breaking scales @xmath11 and @xmath12 with the latter being completely arbitrary and constrained experimentally from below by the latest lhc data @xcite @xmath13 . in the l - r model , the masses of the right - handed neutrinos are proportional to the @xmath10 scale .    in this model ,",
    "the rh neutrinos which are doublet under the @xmath7 gauge symmetry will have masses in the electroweak scale .",
    "an explicit model was constructed in which seesaw mechanism is realized to obtain tiny neutrino masses with the rh neutrinos at the ew scale @xcite .",
    "the implications for the model for neutrino masses and mixings , precision ew tests , lepton violating rare processes were discussed @xcite .",
    "this model , uses an @xmath14 @xcite discrete symmetry .",
    "in addition to the usual higgs doublet , it has a second higgs doublet , two higgs triplets and several higgs singlets .",
    "after the symmetry breaking , the neutral higgses mix .",
    "one of the neutral higgs is the recently observed @xmath15 gev higgs boson .",
    "the model also has doubly charged higgs , singly charged higgs , as well as additional massive neutral higgs . a previous analysis of some aspects of this scalar sector can be found in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the collider implications of this model .",
    "the model has mirror fermions , rh doublets and lh singlets , particularly the mirror quarks .",
    "these particle have masses below @xmath16 gev to satisfy unitarity , and can be copiously produced at the lhc vis their strong color interaction .",
    "these can only decay to ordinary quarks and essentially massless scalars .",
    "depending on the relevant yukawa couplings , these mirror quarks may decay immediately , or may have long life . if they decay immediately , we will get final state with high @xmath17 jets , and large missing energy due the escaping light scalars .",
    "if they have long life , then they can give rise to 2-jets which are coming from displaced vertices .",
    "therefore , the final state signature , in this case , is characterized by 2-jets plus missing transverse momentum ( @xmath18 ) where the jets are not pointing towards the primary vertex . for the lhc multi - jets + @xmath18 analysis ,",
    "such jets are usually considered as `` fake jets '' not originating from the hard scattering and thus , rejected as beam induced background and cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "our presentation below are as follows . in section ii through v , we review the model and the formalism , as well as the the constraints from the electroweak precision tests and the higgs data .",
    "section vi contains our new results where we discuss the implications of the models at the lhc .",
    "we conclude in section vii .",
    "we end this introduction by mentioning an aspect of the sm which often goes unnoticed .",
    "the electroweak phase transition is intrinsically non - perturbative and a common framework for studying non - perturbative phenomena is that of lattice gauge theory .",
    "it has been problematic to put a chiral gauge theory such as the sm on the lattice because of the loss of gauge invariance . ref .",
    "@xcite proposed the introduction of mirror fermions in order to achieve a gauge - invariant formulation of the sm on the lattice .",
    "the mirror fermions of the ew - scale @xmath19 model would play such a role .",
    "finally , we take the liberty to quote a sentence from the famous paper about parity violation of lee and yang @xcite : `` if such asymmetry is indeed found , the question could still be raised whether there could not exist corresponding elementary particles exhibiting opposite asymmetry such that in the broader sense there will still be over - all right - left symmetry .. '' the ew - scale @xmath19 model @xcite is a direct response to this famous quote and is a model which satisfies the electroweak precision data as we have mentioned above .",
    "the ew - scale @xmath19 model @xcite is basically the sm with an extended fermionic [ and scalar ] sector : for every sm left - handed doublet , there is a mirror right - handed doublet , and for every sm right - handed singlet , there is a mirror left - handed singlet .",
    "the gauge group remains the same and , as such , the energy scale characterizing the ew - scale @xmath19 model is still the electroweak scale @xmath20 .",
    "this is the reason , as we shall see in the brief review , for the majorana mass of the right - handed neutrinos to be bounded from above by the electroweak scale and , as a consequence , for its accessibility at colliders such as the lhc and the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that as discussed in @xcite in detail , the statement that the right - handed neutrino masses are bounded by the electroweak scale is assuming @xmath21 .",
    "* * gauge group of the ew - scale @xmath19 model * : + su(3)_c su(2)_w u(1)_y + notice the absence of the subscript `` l '' in @xmath7 .",

    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "in light of the discovery of the 125-gev sm - like scalar , it is imperative that any model beyond the sm ( bsm ) shows a scalar spectrum that contains at least one higgs field with the desired properties as required by experiment .",

    "small values of this yukawa coupling result in small decay widths and hence , a long lifetime for the lightest mirror quark . in this case , the produced mirror quarks hadronize before they decay . depending on the smallness of the yukawa coupling , the hadronized mirror quarks decay a few mm to a few cm away from the hard scattering point .",
    "the decay of a mirror quark gives rise to a missing particle and a jet .",
    "however , if the decays take place at a point different from the primary vertex then present lhc jet reconstruction algorithms categorize the resulting jets as `` fake jets '' @xcite .",
    "the lhc jet reconstruction algorithm is designed to distinguish jets produced in proton - proton collisions and `` fake jets '' not originating from hard scattering events .",
    "`` fake jets '' come from different sources like the collision of one proton of the beam with the residual gas within the beam pipe , beam - halo events , cosmic rays e.t.c .",
    "the lhc jet reconstruction algorithm employs criteria like the distribution of energy deposits by the jet , the shower shape and its direction , in particular the pointing to the interaction point to discriminate collision jets and `` fake jets '' . in the context of our model ,",
    "if the mirror quark decays away from the interaction point then the resulting jets will not point towards the interaction point and hence , will be considered as `` fake jets '' by the present lhc jet reconstruction algorithm .",
    "moreover , in the absence of any information about the other decay product namely , the invisible scalar @xmath30 , it will be very challenging to reconstruct the secondary vertex .",
    "therefore , in order to study such events , a new algorithm for the jet reconstruction is required .",
    "it is beyond the scope of our parton level monte carlo analysis to study such events .",
    "we have explored the new physics possibilities at the 13 tev lhc run .",

    "the model satisfies the ew precision constraints as well as the constraints from the 125 gev higgs data .    in this work ,",
    "we have explored the implications of the model for the 8 and 13 tev lhc .",
    "since the model has colored quarks of chirality opposite to the sm quarks ( the mirror quarks ) and there is only one symmetry breaking scale , the usual ew scale @xmath91 250 gev , which gives masses to these mirror quarks , they can not be heavier than @xmath91 900 gev from the unitarity of the yukawa couplings .",
    "thus these mirror quarks will be copiously produced at the lhc .",
    "once produced , in the model , they can decay to ordinary quarks and singlet higgs . at the interaction point if the corresponding yukawa coupling is not tiny , the final states are two ordinary quarks , or two @xmath92 quarks and large missing energy due to the escaping singlet higgs .",

    "comparing these with the corresponding experimental limit plots produced by the cms collaboration at the 8 tev lhc , we find that the mass of the lightest mirror quark as low as @xmath91 600 gev is allowed for br(@xmath93 ) = 100% . however , if the branching ratio of @xmath93 is 50% or less then there is no bound from the lhc 8 tev data . furthermore",
    ", this bound applies only to prompt decays of mirror quarks . for displaced decays with decay lengths greater than 1 mm or so",
    ", this bound is no longer valid and the mirror quark mass can be lower .",
    "assuming prompt decays of mirror quarks , we have also calculated the signal as well as the sm background at the 13 tev lhc .",
    "we find that the signal for the final state signature with a 5 sigma confidence level can be observed for the lightest mirror quark mass of @xmath91 700 gev with an integrated luminosity @xmath94 .",

    "<S> observation of non - zero neutrino masses at a scale @xmath0 ev is a major problem in the otherwise highly successful standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the most elegant mechanism to explain such tiny neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism with right handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> however , the required seesaw scale is so high , @xmath1 gev , it will not have any collider implications . </S>",
    "<S> recently , an explicit model has been constructed to realize the seesaw mechanism with the right handed neutrinos at the electroweak scale . the model has a mirror symmetry having both the left and right lepton and quark doublets and singlets for the same @xmath2 gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> additional higgs multiplets have been introduced to realize this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that these extra higgs fields also help to satisfy the precision electroweak tests , and other observables . because the scale of the symmetry breaking is electroweak , both the mirror quark and mirror leptons have masses in the electroweak scale in the range @xmath3 gev </S>",
    "<S> . the mirror quarks / leptons decay to ordinary quarks /leptons plus very light neutral scalars . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the final state signals arising from the pair productions of these mirror quarks and their subsequent decays . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these signals are well observable over the standard model background for @xmath4 tev lhc . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the associated yukawa couplings , these decays can also give rise displaced vertices with long decay length , very different from the usual displaced vertices associated with b decays . </S>"
