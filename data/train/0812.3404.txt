    ", we need a solid theoretical background . the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff ( dmt )",
    "@xcite provides such a theoretical background for multiple - antenna systems .",
    "it establishes the fundamental tradeoff between reliability and rate via diversity and multiplexing gains .",
    "diversity gain is a measure of reliability , and shows how fast the error probability decays with increasing signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "similarly , multiplexing gain is related to the transmission rate of the system , and shows how this rate increases with increasing snr .",
    "cooperation / relaying is going to be fully integrated in the standard operation of next generation wireless communications  @xcite . in wireless channels , nearby nodes can overhear source messages for free .",
    "due to this _ wireless broadcast advantage _ , relays can process the overheard information and forward it to the destination terminal .",
    "the destination can then combine the direct signal from the source and the forwarded signals from the relays to improve the system performance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    to understand large , multiple - antenna cooperative networks",
    ", the theory has to account for practical system constraints such as power , bandwidth or delay limitations .",
    "another important constraint in relay channels is the half - duplex constraint .",
    "as the transmit power overwhelms the received power , wireless devices can not transmit and receive at the same time in the same band .",
    "in other words , they are not full - duplex ; they have to operate in half - duplex mode .",
    "the half - duplex relay channel dmt has been already studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "orthogonal amplify - and - forward and decode - and - forward dmt are studied for the single - antenna relay channel . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the single - antenna relay channel and investigate the dmt of the non - orthogonal amplify - and - forward and the dynamic decode - and - forward protocols .",
    "prasad and varanasi @xcite investigate a multiple relay channel with single antenna source and relays and a multiple antenna destination and propose space - time coding strategies .",
    "bletsas et al .",
    "@xcite study relay selection as an alternate way to obtain dmt improvements in a multiple relay setting , and pawar et al .",
    "describe in @xcite a new `` quantize - and - map '' relaying scheme that achieves the half - duplex dmt .",
    "in all these works , the number of degrees of freedom in the source - destination channel is equal to one ; i.e.  either the source or the destination is allowed multiple antennas , but not both . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the multiple - antenna relay channel dmt , thereby increasing the degrees of freedom in the direct link .",
    "they first state the static half - duplex dmt upper bound without explicitly computing it , and then show that the compress - and - forward protocol achieves this upper bound for any number of antennas at the source , the relay or the destination .",
    "the above mentioned papers enlighten many important issues about the dmt of the half - duplex relay channel . however ,",
    "while compress - and - forward is known to be dmt achieving ( under suitable assumptions on the available channel state information ) , the exact static half - duplex dmt for arbitrary antenna configurations has not been computed yet .",
    "when nodes have multiple antennas , this computation is a mathematically challenging problem at first sight , as it requires the knowledge of the joint eigenvalue distribution of two correlated wishart matrices , which has not yet been addressed in the literature . in this paper",
    ", we take a slight detour that allows us to express the static half - duplex dmt as the solution of a minimization problem .",
    "an explicit expression is moreover found for the dmt when the source and the destination have @xmath0 antennas each and the relay has @xmath1 antennas .",
    "this analysis brings us to the study of new asymptotics of spherical integrals ( see section [ sec : spherical ] ) , which is a topic of mathematical interest in itself .",
    "finally , a natural question regarding the half - duplex constraint on the relay is to understand whether this constraint imposes a limitation on the system performance , in comparison to a relay operating in full - duplex mode .",
    "the dmt computation leads us to the following rather unexpected answer : when the relay has two or more antennas , the half - duplex constraint imposes a strict limitation on the system performance , _ irrespective _ of the number of antennas at the source and the destination .",
    "the only case where the half - duplex constraint imposes no limitation ( in the dmt sense ) is therefore the case where the relay has a single antenna .",
    "this fact was already acknowledged in the case where source and destination have a single antenna each @xcite ; it is nevertheless surprising to observe that when the relay has multiple antennas , increasing the number of antennas at both the source and the destination does not allow to get rid of the half - duplex limitation .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "after the introduction of the system model in section [ sec : systemmodel ] , we first review in section [ sec : prelim ] classical dmt results for the point - to - point mimo channel and the full - duplex relay ; we then derive the cut - set upper bound on the dmt in the half - duplex case and describe the dmt achieving compress - and - forward scheme . in section [ sec : method ] , we present our computation method for the dmt upper bound , that involves the study of the joint eigenvalue distribution of random matrices and leads us to writing the dmt as the solution of a minimization problem . in section [ sec : expression ] , we give the explicit expression of the dmt in the case where the source and the detination have the same number of antennas .",
    "finally , we analyze in detail in section [ sec : spherical ] the asymptotics of spherical integrals that are required for the dmt computation .",
    "we study the mimo static half - duplex relay channel where the source , the relay and and the destination have @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 antennas respectively , see figure [ fig : systemmodelgh ] .",
    "the relay listens for a fraction @xmath4 of the time , and transmits in the remaining @xmath5 fraction , @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "when the relay is listening , i.e.  the system is in state @xmath7 , the received signals at the relay and the destination are @xmath8 when the relay is transmitting , i.e.  the system is in state @xmath9 , the received signal at the destination is @xmath10 the column vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are respectively of length @xmath0 and @xmath1 and denote the signals the source and the relay transmit in state @xmath14 . as the relay is half - duplex , @xmath15 . similarly @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath13 are respectively of length @xmath1 and @xmath0 and denote the received signals at the destination and at the relay .",
    "note that @xmath18 .",
    "the channel gain matrices @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are of size @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively and are assumed to have independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",

    "fading is supposed slow and frequency non - selective , so that it remains fixed for one frame length .",

    "the relay listens for @xmath4 fraction of the time , and transmits in the remaining @xmath27.,width=377 ]    the source and the relay have average short - term power constraints @xmath28 and @xmath29 for each codeword transmitted . as a constant scaling in transmitted power does not change the dmt @xcite , we will assume that @xmath30 in the rest of this paper .",
    "there is no transmitter channel state information at the source or at the relay . on the other hand",
    ", we assume that there are pilot signals to measure receiver channel gains , and thus the relay and the destination know their incoming fading levels .    in this paper",
    ", we compute the static half - duplex dmt upper bound , when there is only receiver channel state information . on the other hand , the bound presented in the following is still valid , if transmitter channel state information is available at the source , and the relay and the destination know all the channel gains in the system , but the system operates at _ constant information rate_. under these assumptions , there exists a scheme that achieves the dmt upper bound we find .",
    "we describe this dmt optimal relaying protocol in section [ subsec : prelimach ] .",
    "although the relay is informed about its incoming channel gains , we assume that the relay does not use this information to determine the amount of time it listens or transmits .",
    "we therefore assume that the relay employs a _",
    "static protocol _ for communication , in which the decision of transmitting or receiving is not based on the channel matrix realizations , but only on their respective distributions .",
    "_ dynamic protocols _ , in which the relay chooses @xmath4 based on its channel state observations , have the potential to achieve better half - duplex dmt .",
    "however , dynamic protocols are more complex to study and the half - duplex dmt computation already constitutes a hard problem . in this paper , we thus focus on static protocols only .    without loss of generality",
    ", we also assume that the relay employs a fixed protocol . in fixed protocols",
    ", the relay does not carry information via breaking its transmission and reception intervals into smaller blocks and controlling its state variable .",
    "if the relay protocol were not fixed but random , the state variable could be used to convey additional information . however ,",
    "the increase is at most one bit and the dmt results remain the same @xcite .    as the source node",
    "does not have channel state information , an outage occurs if the mutual information at the destination is not large enough to support the fixed target communication rate the source chooses . in this paper",
    ", we study the minimum outage probability achieved by such a system at high snr , following the approach of zheng and tse in @xcite .",
    "in the next section , we overview the dmt for point - to - point mimo channels , the dmt for the mimo full - duplex relay channel , and the cut - set bound mutual information expressions for the mimo static half - duplex relay channel .",
    "the dmt was first defined for slow , frequency non - selective rayleigh fading point - to - point mimo channels @xcite .",
    "assume there are @xmath3 antennas at the source and @xmath0 antennas at the destination .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the transmission rate of this @xmath22 system and @xmath32 denote the probability of error as a function of the transmit power ( equal to the average received power as the channel gains have unit variance ) .",
    "we let the transmission rate vary logarithmically with the transmit power constraint .",
    "then the multiplexing gain @xmath33 and the corresponding diversity gain @xmath34 are defined as @xmath35 the dmt curve @xmath36 indicates the tradeoff between these two gains , and is the piecewise linear curve joining the points @xmath37 for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 notice that @xmath40 . for ease of notation , we will assume in the following that the transmission rate is chosen as @xmath41 , for all @xmath42 .",
    "the full - duplex relay channel dmt was computed in @xcite .",
    "the relay forms a virtual antenna array with either the transmitter or the receiver , so using the classical cut - set bound argument shows that the performance of the system is upper bounded by the minimum of the performance of a mimo point - to - point channel with either @xmath43 antennas or @xmath44 antennas , i.e. , @xmath45 moreover , the compress - and - forward protocol achieves this dmt upper bound , when the relay and the destination are informed about all the channel gains in the system @xcite . in the following , we will use this performance as a benchmark and exhibit what loss is to be expected when operating the relay in half - duplex mode .      in this paper ,",
    "our objective is to compute the static half - duplex mimo relay channel dmt under the assumptions explained in section  [ sec : systemmodel ] .",
    "however , no relaying protocol is known to achieve this bound under these assumptions . only under full channel state information assumption at the relay and the destination",
    "do we know how to achieve the static half - duplex dmt upper bound . in such systems , the only known static half - duplex dmt optimal protocol is compress - and - forward .    in the compress - and - forward protocol , the relay first compresses its received signal @xmath46 , and then forwards the compressed signal through the relay - destination channel in the @xmath27 fraction of the time it transmits .",
    "the compression at the relay is of wyner- ziv type @xcite , in the sense that the relay compresses its received signal taking into account that the destination has side information @xmath47 , available directly from the source .",
    "although this protocol does not utilize the channel state information available at the source , the relay needs to know all the channel gains in the system to ensure that the compressed signal is received reliably at the destination .",
    "the soft information transmission of the compress - and - forward protocol is crucial to achieve optimal diversity and multiplexing gains .",
    "protocols such as decode - and - forward @xcite , which perform a hard decision about the source message , result in dmt suboptimal performance .    as a side remark",
    ", we notice that the compress - and - forward operation is dmt optimal not only for the static half - duplex relay channel , but also for the dynamic one .",
    "however , for the dynamic half - duplex relay channel , the dmt upper bound is hard to compute .      in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that cut - set bounds and the associated outage expressions can be used to find dmt upper bounds .",
    "following the same approach , we provide next the cut - set bounds for the static half - duplex relay channel and the corresponding probability of outage expressions to find the best half - duplex relay channel dmt for static protocols .    in the half - duplex , fixed and static relay channel , the mutual information expressions for the cut - sets around the source and the destination are respectively equal to @xmath48 to find the best static dmt upper bound , we need to find the maximum of these mutual information expressions , which are obtained when gaussian codebooks are used and the input covariance matrix is chosen optimally @xcite .    we know that for any channel matrix @xmath49 of size @xmath24 and for any input covariance matrix @xmath50 of size @xmath51 @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the identity matrix of size @xmath54 , and @xmath55 denotes conjugate transpose . using this inequality , we can further upper bound ( [ eqn : cutset1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : cutset2 ] ) as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58\\left[\\begin{array}{c } g \\\\",

    "when the relay is half - duplex , it can only transmit during a fraction @xmath6 $ ] of the time ( and therefore receive during the other fraction @xmath27 ) .",
    "because of the static protocol assumption , the fraction @xmath4 is a fixed number , chosen according to the distribution of the channel coefficients only , and not to their realizations ( but notice that @xmath4 depends a priori on the target rate @xmath33 ) .    in section [ sec : method ] below , we explain how to write the above diversity order @xmath67 as the solution of a minimization problem , following the methodology of @xcite . in section [ sec : expression ] , we show that in the particular case where the number of antennas at the source and the destination are equal ( i.e. , @xmath68 ) , the symmetry of the above minimization problem allows us to write down @xmath67 explicitly .",

    "let @xmath75 be the eigenvalues of @xmath76 and @xmath77 be the eigenvalues of @xmath78 . since both these matrices are classical wishart matrices , the ( separate ) joint distributions of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are well known .",
    "nevertheless , in order to compute the above diversity order ( following the methodology of zheng and tse in @xcite ) , what is a priori needed is the _ joint _ distribution of _ all _ the eigenvalues @xmath81 .",
    "this distribution is hard to obtain , because of the intricate correlation of the matrices @xmath76 and @xmath78 .",
    "a method is presented below that allows to compute the diversity order in the general case , but avoids the computation of the joint eigenvalue distribution .",
    "the latter question has not been addressed yet in the mathematical literature and remains an interesting open problem in its own right .",
    "our computation method goes as follows .",
    "we have @xmath82 since @xmath19 and @xmath49 are independent and their respective distributions are unitarily invariant , this expression has the same distribution as @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 are the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath76 and the number of zeros in the list is equal to @xmath86 .",
    "let now @xmath87 ( @xmath24 matrix ) and observe that @xmath88 _ conditioned on @xmath89 _ ( which is independent of @xmath49 ) , the joint distribution of the entries of @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 the spectral decomposition of the @xmath54 matrix @xmath92 reads @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a @xmath54 unitary matrix and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 are the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath92 and the number of zeros in the list is equal to @xmath97 .    as the diagonal matrices @xmath89 and @xmath98 might contain zeros , let us define @xmath99 as well as @xmath100 .",
    "the jacobian of the transformation @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 therefore , conditioned on @xmath89 ( or @xmath103 ) , the joint distribution of @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 so @xmath94 is independent of @xmath106 and distributed according to the haar measure on the set @xmath2 of unitary @xmath54 matrices ( that is , the columns of @xmath94 form a set of @xmath0 orthonormal vectors which are uniformly distributed on the sphere @xmath107 ) .",
    "this allows us to compute the conditional distribution @xmath108 : @xmath109 let finally @xmath110 it is a well known fact that the distribution of @xmath103 is the classical wishart distribution : @xmath111 so we obtain @xmath112 notice that the spherical integral on the far right may be rewritten as @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes the expectation with respect to the haar measure on @xmath2 .",
    "remember now that we are interested in computing @xmath115 following zheng and tse , let us make the change of variables @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the behaviour in the limit @xmath120 of most terms in ( [ joint ] ) is well known , except for the spherical integral .",
    "let us define @xmath121 the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath122 is given by @xmath123 we relegate the proof of this asymptotic equality to section [ sec : spherical ] .",
    "the diversity order corresponding to the cut around the destination ( [ cutsetd ] ) can now be computed via the standard method developed in @xcite .",
    "the computation leads to the following optimization problem : @xmath124 where the minimization takes place over the set of variables @xmath125 and @xmath126 such that @xmath127 and @xmath128 , for all @xmath129 , @xmath130 such that @xmath131 .",

    "in the next section , we solve the above minimizations problem in the particular case where @xmath139 and thus find an explicit expression for the diversity order @xmath67 .",
    "in the case where the number of antennas at the source and the destination are equal ( i.e. , @xmath68 ) , the symmetry of the problem implies that the optimal value of ( [ eqn : poutr0 ] ) and thus of ( [ eqn : dmt_upperbound ] ) is reached when @xmath140 , for all values of @xmath33 , and the minimization problems ( [ optprobd ] ) and ( [ optprobs ] ) boil down to the same expression : @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath126 are such that @xmath143 and @xmath128 , for all @xmath144 , @xmath130 such that @xmath131 . so @xmath145 the above minimization problem constitutes a convex programming problem .",
    "it therefore has a unique solution , which can be found via different classical algorithms .",
    "the solution given below has first been obtained through numerical simulations for a relatively large number of values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) . from these results , the general form of the solution",
    "could then be deduced by extrapolation .",
    "we therefore acknowledge that our derivation is not completely analytical .",
    "our confidence in the result is strong , however , and we check below that our proposed solution satisfies the constraints of the problem , so that it is at least an upper bound on the actual solution of the minimization problem .    in order to describe the solution , let us define @xmath148 to be the minimum of @xmath0 and @xmath149 ( so @xmath150 if @xmath151 ; otherwise , @xmath148 is an integer number between @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) .",
    "it turns out that this number delimitates three different regimes for the dmt curve :    \\a ) for @xmath154 ( low multiplexing gain ) , the outage probability of the half - duplex relay is determined by the outage of the @xmath24 relay link matrix @xmath49 ( the direct link matrix @xmath19 being already off ) . in this regime ,",

    "notice that , as already mentioned in the introduction , the only case where the half - duplex curve matches the full - duplex @xmath160 curve is when @xmath161 , i.e. @xmath162 , and @xmath0 takes any integer value . for any @xmath163",

    "in this situation , it is clear that due to the inherent asymmetry of the problem , the optimal proportion @xmath4 where the relay is listening is not equal to @xmath193 .",
