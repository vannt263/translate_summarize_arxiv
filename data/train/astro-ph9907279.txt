    "the central problem of accretion disk theory is understanding the mechanism of angular momentum transport .",
    "the angular momentum must flow outward in order that matter accrete onto the central gravitating object .",
    "earlier work suggested hydrodynamic turbulence as the mechanism of enhanced turbulent viscosity @xmath9 , with @xmath10 a dimensionless constant , @xmath11 the sound speed , and @xmath12 the half - thickness of the disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "however , the physical origin and level of the turbulence is not established ( see @xcite for a review ) . recently ,",
    "the magneto - rotational instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see review by @xcite ) has been studied in @xmath13 and @xmath14 mhd simulations and shown to give a maxwell stress sufficient to give significant outward transport of angular momentum ( @xcite ) ; that is , a statistically averaged , effective shakura - sunyaev alpha parameter is found to be @xmath15 ( brandenburg et al .",
    "however , significant questions remain .",
    "the simulation studies are local in that a shearing patch or box of the actual disk of size @xmath16 is treated ; and the boundary conditions on the top of the box have so far been unphysical .",
    "furthermore , disks in some systems ( e.g. , protostellar systems ) are predicted to have very small conductivity so that coupling between matter and magnetic field is negligible .",
    "interesting fundamental questions still exist concerning pure hydrodynamic processes in accretion disks .",
    "one well - known hydrodynamic instability of disks is the papaloizou - pringle instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; hereafter pp ) which has been extensively studied both in linear theory and by numerical simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see review by @xcite ) . in these studies ,",
    "the `` disk '' is taken to be a thin torus ( finite height ) or annulus ( infinite along @xmath17 ) with the radial width much less than the radius .",
    "the corotation radius , where the phase velocity of the wave @xmath18 equals the angular velocity of the matter @xmath2 , has a crucial role in that a wave propagating radially across it can be amplified .",
    "however , significant growth of a wave typically requires many passages through the corotation radius and this requires _ reflecting _ inner and/or outer boundaries of the disk .",
    "thus the pp instability depends on inner and outer disk boundary conditions which are artificial for accretion disks .",
    "recently , we pointed out a new rossby wave instability of non - magnetized accretion disks ( @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "paper i shows that the local wkb dispersion relation for the unstable modes is closely analogous to that for rossby waves in planetary atmospheres .",
    "rossby vortices associated with the waves are well known in planetary atmospheres and give rise for example to the giant red spot on jupiter ( sommeria , meyers , & swinney 1988 ; marcus 1989 , 1990 ) .    in the cases considered in paper",
    "i , the instability occurs when there is a `` bump '' in the radial variation of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the surface mass density of the disk , @xmath2 the angular rotation rate ,",
    "@xmath3 the specific entropy , @xmath4 the adiabatic index , and @xmath5 the radial epicyclic frequency .",
    "such a bump may arise from the nearly inviscid accretion of matter with finite specific angular momentum @xmath19 onto a compact star or black hole .",
    "the accreting matter tends to `` pile up '' at the centrifugal radius @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 the mass of the central object ) where it gives a radially localized bump in @xmath22 .    in accretion disks in some systems , such as active galactic nuclei , the weak self - gravity at large distances can be important in forming narrow rings ( shlosman , begelman , & frank 1990 ) .",
    "such rings would give a bump in @xmath22 of the form we have assumed .",
    "the bump in @xmath22 is crucial because it leads to trapping of the wave modes in a finite range of radii encompassing the corotation radius .",
    "thus , reflecting inner and outer disk radii required for the pp instability are _ not _ required for the rossby wave instability .",
    "in contrast with studies of the pp instability , we allow a general equation of state where the entropy of the disk matter can vary with radius .",
    "the present paper develops in greater detail the work of paper i and presents the full linear theory analysis of the instability without some simplifying assumptions made there .",
    "the physical nature of the rossby wave instability is shown in figure [ fig : rossby ] where we have overlaid the velocity field onto the surface density variations .",

    "[ sec : discuss ] we discuss the details of this instability and compare it with other hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "conclusions of this work are summarized in  [",
    "sec : conclu ] .",
    "we consider the stability of non - magnetized accretion disks .",
    "the disks are assumed geometrically thin with vertical half - thickness @xmath23 , where @xmath6 is the radial distance .",
    "we use an inertial cylindrical @xmath24 coordinate system . the surface mass density and vertically integrated pressure",
    "are : @xmath25 the equilibrium disk is stationary ( @xmath26 ) and axisymmetric ( @xmath27 ) , with the flow velocity @xmath28 ; that is , the accretion velocity @xmath29 is assumed negligible .",
    "self - gravity of the disk is assumed negligible so that @xmath30 , where @xmath21 is the mass of the central object .",
    "but we will discuss the effects of self - gravity in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "for the axisymmetric equilibrium disk , the radial force balance is : @xmath31 the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium gives @xmath32 , where @xmath33 the square of adiabatic sound speed and @xmath4 is an effective adiabatic index discussed further in  [ sec : diskperb ] .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the stability of equilibrium disks with a slowly varying background shear flow _ and _ a finite - amplitude density variation over a finite radial extent . specifically , we envision conditions where inflowing matter accumulates at some radius , for example , a centrifugal barrier",
    ". this accumulation may occur if matter is supplied at a rate exceeding the rate at which matter spreads by say a turbulent viscosity . depending on the angular momentum distribution of the incoming flow ,",
    "newly supplied matter can form a disk with a finite `` bump '' or `` jump '' in the surface density at say @xmath6 with a radial width @xmath34 . when the disk surface density is sufficiently small , the disk optical depth is small compared with unity and cooling by radiation is efficient .",
    "as more matter is accumulated , the disk becomes optically thick so that heat builds up inside the disk and can be vertically confined , then pressure forces start to have an important role for the disk dynamics .",
    "the present work is directed at optically thick disks with significant pressure forces .",
    "we model the mentioned `` bumps '' and `` jumps '' with fairly general radial profiles of @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",
    "these profiles are used to obtain the corresponding @xmath2 profile using equation ( [ eq : r - balance ] ) . specifically , we consider two surface density distributions : one is has a `` step jump '' from @xmath35 to @xmath36 over @xmath34 and this jump is surrounded by a smooth background flow , @xmath37~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the surface density for the background disk , @xmath39 is its value at @xmath40 and @xmath41 characterizes the slope ( it is @xmath42 in a standard @xmath43 disk model )",

    "we assume an ideal gas equation of state , @xmath47 . depending on whether the flow is homentropic and entropy @xmath48 . in this paper , we use the term _ homentropic _ to indicate that the pressure depends only on density with the entropy a constant , @xmath49 .",
    "the term _ barotropic _ is sometimes used for the same situation .",
    "similarly , we use _ nonhomentropic _ ( instead of _ nonbarotropic _ ) to describe a flow where the entropy is not a constant and @xmath50 . ] or not , we can further derive or specify the radial distributions of temperature @xmath51 and pressure @xmath52 based on @xmath1 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the values at @xmath40 for the background disk .",
    "we also set @xmath55 to be the keplerian speed at @xmath40 , and define the dimensionless sound speed as @xmath56 . in most of the following analysis ,",
    "we take @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .      for homentropic flows",
    ", we can determine @xmath61 and @xmath62 using @xmath63 alone because of the relations @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "based on these , we present two sample initial configurations : one is a step jump with @xmath66 which we call case ` hsj ' ( homentropic step jump ) ; the other is a gaussian bump with @xmath67 which we call case ` hgb ' ( homentropic gaussian bump ) .",
    "the adiabatic index is @xmath68 and the width @xmath69 .",
    "figures [ fig : hsj - equil ] and [ fig : hgb - equil ] show the profiles of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 for the ` hsj ' and ` hgb ' cases .    here",
    ", we have chosen the parameter @xmath41 to be zero in the smooth profile of @xmath74 .",
    "we have studied the dependence of our results on @xmath41 and find that for @xmath75 , our results are essentially independent of @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we omit further discussion of the background disk .      for nonhomentropic flows , we have to specify @xmath62 in addition to @xmath63 in order to determine @xmath61 and consequently @xmath2 .",
    "such conditions were studied in paper i for a gaussian bump , which we will not repeat here . instead , we study a case where there a simultaneous step jump in both surface density and temperature . in order to avoid too many parameters",
    ", we will assume that the width and amplitude of the jumps are the same for surface density and temperature , which are described by equation ( [ eq : sj - rho ] ) .",
    "we will call this initial configuration as case ` nsj ' ( nonhomentropic step jump ) .",
    "figure [ fig : nsj - equil ] shows the dependences of different variables with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "as we show later , the nonhomentropic cases have some quantitative differences from the homentropic cases but the essential physics is the same .",
    "we consider small perturbations to the inviscid euler equations .",

    "@xmath86 is referred to as the entropy of the disk matter .",
    "equation ( [ eq : enpy ] ) corresponds to the adiabatic motion of the disk matter .",
    "the rigorous relation for the perturbation of the disk is of course @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the 3d pressure , density and adiabatic index , respectively .",
    "( we reserve the symbol @xmath90 for mode growth rate . ) for slow perturbations of the disk matter ( time scales @xmath91 ) , we have @xmath92 so that @xmath93 , and consequently @xmath94 with @xmath95 . equations ( [ eq : mascon ] ) - ( [ eq : enpy ] )",
    "are the vertically integrated 2d euler equations .",
    "the equations assume that the disk thickness does not change rapidly with radius or time , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the above equations are closed with an equation of state .",
    "the ideal gas law is applicable for the conditions of interest @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the mean mass per particle .",
    "notice that the pressure is in general a function of _ both _ the surface density @xmath100 and the entropy @xmath48 ( or equivalently , the temperature @xmath101 ) .",

    "it is important to know if the equilibrium disk including the `` jump '' or `` bump '' is stable to axisymmetric perturbations . rather than solving the non - local axisymmetric stability problem ( which can be obtained from equation 15 ) , we consider the local stability criterion for axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "this condition is expected to be a sufficient condition for non - local stability .",
    "if the disk pressure is neglected , then the rayleigh criterion @xmath127 implies axisymmetric stability ( drazin & reid 1981 , ch .",

    "typically @xmath132 is negative for standard disk models ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "although this is an unstable situation for convection in the absence of rotation , it is stabilized by the rotation since @xmath133 is usually much smaller than @xmath134 in an approximate keplerian disk .",
    "figure [ fig : k2n2 ] shows illustrative profiles of @xmath135 and @xmath132 for the case nsj with @xmath136 .",
    "the quantity @xmath137 remains positive .",
    "as the amplitude of the bump / jump @xmath44 increases , we can find a critical value where condition given by equation ( [ eq : k2n2 ] ) is violated .",
    "this happens at @xmath138 for cases hsj , nsj and hgb , respectively .",
    "physically , this means that the local specific angular momentum profile is perturbed enough that it liberates energy when locally exchanging two fluids radially .",
    "actual axisymmetric instability is expected to occur only at values of @xmath44 larger than these @xmath139 values .",
    "note also that the critical values are dependent upon some other parameters , such as @xmath34 , @xmath4 and whether the flow is homentropic or not .",
    "the important point we note here is that we find non - axisymmetric instability at values of @xmath44 appreciable less than the values @xmath139 .",
    "since the eigenfrequency @xmath140 is in general complex , equation ( 16 ) is a second - order differential equation with complex coefficients which are functions of @xmath6 .",
    "if we discretize equation ( [ eq : master ] ) on a grid @xmath141 and combine it with appropriate boundary conditions , the problem becomes that of finding the complex roots of the determinant of an @xmath142 tridiagonal matrix . upon finding the roots , we can then solve for the corresponding complex wave function @xmath124 .",
    "we use a nyquist method to find the @xmath140 eigenvalues . for this",
    "we integrate along a closed path in the complex @xmath143plane and thereby find regions where roots ( and poles ) reside .",
    "we then use a newton root - finder to locate the roots accurately . once a root is found for a particular set of parameters",
    ", we can find other roots by varying the parameters slowly .",
    "there are two apparent singularities in equation ( [ eq : master ] ) , one is at the corotation resonance where @xmath144 , which occurs only on the real @xmath140 axis .",
    "the other is where @xmath145 , which is a generalized form of the lindblad resonance condition for @xmath146 finite .",
    "goldreich et al .",
    "( 1986 ) showed that the first singularity is a real singularity , whereas the second is spurious and is actually a regular point .",
    "they considered the case when @xmath147 , but their conclusion still holds for @xmath146 finite .",
    "thus , extra caution is needed in searching for roots in the complex plane with @xmath123 , because the condition @xmath148 can be satisfied both when @xmath149 and @xmath150 , or when @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the latter case is generally only possible when @xmath153 , which can be true if the pressure bump / jump is strong enough .",
    "the inner and outer boundary on @xmath124 in equation ( 16 ) are important . in most previous studies where a torus is considered",
    ", the boundary condition is that the lagrangian pressure perturbation vanishes at the free surfaces ( both above and below the torus and at its radial limits ) . in the present problem ,",
    "the `` bump '' or `` jump '' is embedded in a background disk so that the appropriate boundaries are necessarily at a large distance from the bump but still in the disk .",
    "inspection of the function @xmath154 in equation ( [ eq : master ] ) shows that @xmath155 and @xmath156 correspond to large distances from the bump . in these outer regions",
    "we can use a wkb representation of @xmath106 with @xmath157 .",
    "we then have @xmath158 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "away from the bump , the @xmath159 term is small and it can be dropped .",

    "this is indeed the dependence found for the calculated wavefunctions discussed in later sections .",
    "similar procedure can be applied to the outer boundary too .",
    "the physical meaning of this radiative boundary condition can be understood by studying the dispersion relation obtained from the wkb approximation at the inner and outer parts of the disk .",
    "let @xmath163 , we have @xmath164 since @xmath165 at both @xmath166 and @xmath167 away from the perturbed region , the dispersion relation is then simply @xmath168 as it turns out that the most unstable mode usually has @xmath125 close to corotation at @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath169 , the above equation implies that we need to choose ``  '' at @xmath166 since @xmath170 and similarly `` + '' at outer boundary .",
    "furthermore , the group velocity @xmath171 at inner and outer radius , respectively . since physically we expect the wave to propagate",
    "away _ from the central region , this requires that @xmath172 at @xmath166 and @xmath173 at @xmath167 , which means @xmath174 at both @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "the computational results presented here we take the inner boundary to be at @xmath175 and the outer boundary at @xmath176 , where @xmath40 is the radius of the `` bump '' or `` jump . ''",
    "we find that there is essentially no dependence of our results on the values of @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "we have experimented with other types of boundary conditions such as vanishing pressure or vanishing radial velocity .",
    "the overall properties of the unstable modes show very little change , but the relative phase between the real and imaginary parts of @xmath106 of course changes .      a different approach to solving the linearized equations ( [ eq : mascon ] - [ eq : enpy ] ) is to treat them as an initial value problem .",

    "solutions of ( 28 ) will eventually be dominated by the _",
    "most _ unstable mode . from this solution",
    "we can get the growth rate , the real frequency , and the radial wave function for all 4 variables .",
    "however , we recommend the method described in  [ sec : method ] because it allows a comprehensive search for unstable modes and the corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "the initial value code for equation ( 28 ) can then be used to verify the behavior of these modes .",
    "we omit a detailed comparison of the results obtained from both types of codes but merely report that we have found excellent agreement between them on growth rates , mode frequencies , and radial structure of eigenmodes .",
    "we present the solutions to equation ( [ eq : master ] ) for different types of initial equilibrium as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : diskeq ] . in paper",
    "i , we showed that a necessary condition for instability is that the key function @xmath0 have an extreme as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "this condition is a generalized rayleigh inflexion point theorem for compressible and nonhomentropic flow .",
    "all three initial equilibria presented earlier satisfy this necessary condition for instability . here",
    "we discuss in detail the behavior of these unstable modes .",
    "the initial equilibrium for this case is shown in figure [ fig : hsj - equil ] . for @xmath185 , we find that the most unstable mode for this equilibrium has a growth rate @xmath186 and a real frequency @xmath187 .",
    "it is informative to plot the effective `` potential , '' @xmath188 of equation ( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "we can neglect @xmath189 because its magnitude is much smaller than @xmath188 .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : master ] ) can be simplified to give @xmath190 then the function @xmath188 is analogous to the quantity @xmath191 in quantum mechanics except that here @xmath188 is complex ( paper i ) .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath188 are shown in figure [ fig : potens ] ( the upper panel ) .",
    "first , we consider the region of @xmath192 , which is most affected by the presence of the surface density jump .",
    "there is a negative real part of @xmath193 which is analogous to the `` potential well '' in quantum mechanics where bound states are possible , though again the fact that @xmath154 is complex prevents a direct analogy .",
    "the two sharp `` peaks '' in this region are not singularities but result from the two extrema of @xmath194 . in the region",
    "@xmath195 , the function @xmath193 is dominated by @xmath196 , whereas for @xmath197 , @xmath193 is dominated by @xmath198 const .",
    "now consider an unstable mode that is excited in the `` potential well '' around @xmath40 .",
    "the positive potential around @xmath199 and @xmath200 causes this mode to be evanescent in this region .",
    "the potential is negative for @xmath155 and @xmath201 so that there will be a finite probability for this mode to `` tunnel '' through the potential `` barriers '' . in other words ,",
    "a mode excited around @xmath40 by the surface density jump can `` radiate away '' into both the inner and outer parts of the disk .",
    "this is indeed the case as seen in figure [ fig : eigenfn - hsj ] which shows the radial eigenfunctions of various physical quantities derived from @xmath124 using equations ( [ eq : rho])-([eq : vp ] ) . in obtaining these eigenfunctions ,",
    "we have used outward propagating sound wave boundary ( i.e. , radiative ) conditions discussed earlier .",
    "the relative phase shift between real and imaginary parts indicates this propagation .",
    "note that the `` wavelength '' of the unstable modes is at least @xmath202 ; that is , the 2d approximation is satisfied . furthermore , we have maintained the actual _ relative _ amplitude among all 4 variables .      for @xmath185 ,",
    "the most unstable mode for this nonhomentropic equilibrium has a growth rate @xmath203 , and a real frequency @xmath204 .",
    "these values are slightly different from the homentropic case presented above with a slightly higher growth rate .",
    "note that the two cases have roughly the same jump in total pressure but the homentropic case requires a higher surface density jump .",
    "this will always be the case if @xmath205 . consequently , ` nsj ' case has a slightly deeper `` trap '' which is shown in both the @xmath134 and the effective potential @xmath193 as depicted in figure [ fig : potens ] ( the middle panel ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions for all 4 variables are almost the same as in the case ` hsj ' ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : eigenfn - hsj ] ) , therefore we do not show them here .    the comparison between cases ` nsj ' and ` hsj ' confirms one of the conclusions in paper i that the variation of the temperature is more effective than that of the surface density in driving this instability .      for @xmath185",
    ", the most unstable mode for this case occurs with a growth rate @xmath207 , and a real frequency @xmath208 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath193 for this case is shown in figure [ fig : potens ] ( the bottom panel ) .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions are shown in figure [ fig : eigenfn - hgb ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the rather small gaussian bump used here ( @xmath206 ) , the instability has a higher growth rate than the step jump cases considered above .",
    "this difference can be understood as due to the deeper `` trap '' produced by the gaussian bump .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the @xmath209 profiles for both cases using figure [ fig : hsj - equil ] and [ fig : hgb - equil ] . since @xmath210 is positive at both",
    "the rising and declining edges of a gaussian bump , and is positive only at the rising edge of a step jump , the @xmath134 profile has two regions that are higher than @xmath211 in ` hgb ' compared to just one such region in ` hsj ' . in general , larger @xmath134 indicates stronger stability , and they directly translate into the `` forbidden '' regions in the potential structures shown in figure [ fig : potens ] ( the bottom panel ) .",
    "thus , a mode excited around @xmath40 is well trapped by the `` walls '' at @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "the ` hsj ' case also has a positive spike at @xmath214 , but it does not provide good trapping because the spike is too narrow .",
    "again , we have used the outward propagating sound wave boundary conditions discussed earlier so that there is a finite probability for an unstable mode to tunnel through the potential barriers .      consider now the dependence of the growth rate and mode frequency on the bump / jump amplitude @xmath44 and the azimuthal mode number @xmath215 .",
    "as the amplitude @xmath44 decreases , the growth rate of the instability is expected to decrease . at small enough @xmath216",
    ", the instability should turn off ( paper i ) .",
    "it is clearly of interest to determine the minimum @xmath44 for instability .",
    "figure [ fig : modegama ] shows the growth rate and mode frequency as a function of @xmath44 for the three cases considered , all for @xmath217 .",
    "the threshold values are @xmath218 and @xmath219 , for cases ` hsj ' , ` nsj ' , and ` hgb ' , respectively .",
    "note that the values of @xmath220 depend on @xmath34 because the radial gradient of the surface density @xmath1 is important in giving instability .",
    "roughly speaking , a factor of @xmath221 `` jump '' or an @xmath222 `` bump '' in the surface density are sufficient to cause the rossby wave instability .",
    "the vertical dashed lines in figure [ fig : modegama ] indicate the @xmath44 values beyond which part of the flow has @xmath223 as discussed in  [ sec : rayleigh ] . in the step jump cases ,",
    "the the rossby wave instability continues smoothly through the point where @xmath134 changes sign . in case ` hgb ' , the instability also exists for values of @xmath44 where @xmath224 in part of the flow .",
    "there is a continuous increase in growth rate as @xmath44 increases ( not shown here ) , although there seems to be a `` kink '' at the point where @xmath225 starts to have a range of negative values .",
    "we do not pursue here the situation when both the rossby and the axisymmetric instabilities are present simultaneously .",
    "we emphasize that the rossby instability discussed here has a substantial growth rate ( @xmath226 ) when the flow is stable to axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "figure [ fig : modegamm ] shows the dependences of the growth rate and mode frequency on the azimuthal mode number @xmath215 for the three cases .",
    "the peak of the growth rates around @xmath227 probably results from a preferred azimuthal wavelength in comparison with the radial wavelength of the unstable modes .",
    "because the rossby instability depends critically on the pressure forces , its growth rate has a strong dependence on the magnitude of sound speed .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : gamma - cs ] for the ` hsj ' case for @xmath217 .",
    "as the sound speed decreases , the pressure forces are no longer strong enough to perturb the rotational flow , the instability disappears .",
    "this is similar to the threshold seen in figure [ fig : modegama ] when the pressure jump / bump is too small .",
    "judging from the plot , the growth rate increases roughly linearly with @xmath11 .",
    "note that the threshold value of @xmath11 also depends on @xmath34 .",
    "as @xmath11 decreases , so does the thickness of the disk .",
    "thus , the allowed @xmath34 can be smaller so long as the wavelength of the unstable modes is larger than the disk thickness .",
    "this is a necessary condition for 2d approximation to be satisfied .",
    "the condition for the rossby wave instability ( hereafter , rwi ) discussed here can be understood in terms of the rayleigh s inflexion - point theorem ( drazin & reid 1981 , p.81 ) , which gives a necessary condition for instability .",
    "if the accretion disk is close to keplerian everywhere with temperature and density being smooth powerlaws , the rwi does not occur .",
    "the local extreme value of the key function @xmath22 considered here is caused by the local step jump or gaussian bump in surface density ( or possibly in temperature if the flow is nonhomentropic ) .",
    "however , the considered profiles of @xmath1 and @xmath7 are not the only ones which may lead to instability . for example",
    ", a profile with a local extreme in potential vorticity distribution may also give instability .",
    "an important aspect of the rwi is that the required threshold for instability is quite small .",
    "typically , a @xmath228 variation of @xmath1 over a lengthscale slightly larger than the thickness of the disk gives instability .",
    "the question is , then , can such an initial equilibrium exist in real astrophysical systems ?",
    "the answer to this question requires detailed knowledge about how matter is initially `` brought '' in towards the gravitating object .",
    "one plausible situation is that accreting matter is gradually stored at some large radial distance .",
    "subsequently , after say a sufficient build up of matter then efficient accretion can proceed .",
    "this is perhaps the physical situation in the case of low mass x - ray binaries where the systems go through episodes of outbursts with long , quiescent intervals between them ( see tanaka & shibazaki 1996 for a review ) . in protostellar disks , it is possible that different regions of the disk have different coupling strength between matter and the magnetic field .",
    "this could lead to accumulation of matter at large distances where the disk is non - magnetized . at smaller distances",
    ", the accretion may be due to the maxwell stress from due to turbulent magnetic fields arising from the balbus - hawley instability ( brandenburg 1998 ) .",
    "matter accumulation over some finite extent in radius could most likely lead to enhanced gradients of surface density and/or temperature , thus satisfying the conditions for the rwi discussed here .",
    "another aspect of the problem is the role of vertical convection .",
    "we have mostly discussed our instability in the 2d limit where the vertical variation of physical quantities is all averaged away . in real disks , however , there are certain processes in the vertical direction that could occur on a fast timescale , such as vertical convection ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the vertical convection is perhaps not a main concern here since it helps to bring the matter in a vertical column to the same entropy , which is assumed in our present study .",
    "for the horizontal motion , as we emphasized before , the initial equilibria we have studied are all stable to the local convective instabilities .",
    "so , the rwi will always be the dominant instability unless there are other instabilities ( in the @xmath229 plane ) that have lower thresholds and faster growth rates .      for accretion disks in some systems , for example , active galactic nuclei and protostellar systems",
    ", self - gravity may be important at large distances and lead to axisymmetric instability . the wkb dispersion relation for @xmath230 perturbations of a self - gravitating disk is @xmath231 ( safronov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ) .",
    "the least stable , smallest @xmath232 mode occurs for @xmath233 , and for this wavenumber , @xmath234 .",
    "thus , the disk is unstable if toomre s parameter @xmath235 .",
    "the threshold for instability @xmath236 corresponds to a surface mass density in the case of an agn disk of @xmath237 where we assumed @xmath238 ( shlosman , begelman , & frank 1990 ) .    near the threshold with @xmath239",
    "somewhat less than unity , this instability will act to make axisymmetric rings with radial wavelength @xmath240 .",
    "these rings have a form similar to the case of our `` gaussian bump . ''",
    "only a relatively small linear growth of the rings is needed for the non - axisymmetric rwi to set in with a very large growth rate .",
    "it is important to note that the rwi is capable of transporting angular momentum and thereby facilitating accretion whereas the axisymmetric instability is not .",
    "we mentioned earlier the important role of the pressure ( @xmath241 ) for the rwi .",
    "this leads to an important physical requirement on the minimum surface mass density @xmath242 of the disk for the rwi to be important .",
    "heat must be confined in the region of rwi for a time much longer than rotation period in order that the mode grows without radiative cooling .",
    "this confinement requires a minimum surface density which depends on the opacity and specific heat of matter .",
    "this translates to roughly @xmath243 g @xmath244 . in other words , if @xmath100 is too small , the rwi will not occur and there will be no rossby vortex induced accretion .",
    "but once enough matter has accumulated so that @xmath100 exceeds this threshold @xmath242 , rwi sets in and there is efficient accretion due to rossby vortices .",
    "this may correspond to the distinctly different states of accretion in x - ray binary systems where sources are often observed to be `` active '' or `` quiescent '' .    as shown by tanaka & shibazaki ( 1996 ) ,",
    "x - ray novae ( especially black hole candidates ) show long quiescent intervals in x - rays despite that the companion star is still continuously feeding mass to the compact object at @xmath245 gm s@xmath246 .",
    "this strongly implies a mass accumulation at some large distances without much accretion going on .",
    "the accumulated mass over an interval of @xmath247 yrs will be @xmath248 gm , which gives a surface density of @xmath249 g @xmath244 with a size of @xmath250 cm .",
    "this critical @xmath100 is interestingly close to the value we discussed above .",
    "so , we believe it is worthwhile to pursue rwi as an alternative mechanism for causing an outburst in x - ray novae , in addition to the usual disk instability models .",
    "it is difficult to make a direct comparison of the rwi with the original papaloizou & pringle instability . in pp instability ,",
    "a torus and/or an annulus has two edges and the existence of certain unstable modes critically depends on these edges ( i.e. , the so - called `` principal branch '' ) . in our study , the surface density bump case can perhaps be viewed as a torus except that it is embedded in a background keplerian shear flow . here",
    ", we discuss two major differences between the two instabilities . one is the treatment of boundary conditions . in our study , the propagating sound wave boundary condition provides a natural and important link of the unstable region with the surrounding flow .",
    "this allows us to directly apply such instability to thin keplerian accretion disk of a much larger radial extent . in the nonlinear regime",
    ", this `` leakage '' will allow the unstable modes to grow further nonlinearly and impact a large part of the disk flow also .",
    "the second difference is the fact that , unlike pp instability , the rotational profile @xmath2 is not taken as a single power - law in our case .",
    "instead , enhanced epicyclic frequency occurs in association with the surface density jump / bump boundaries .",
    "this naturally creates the `` potential well '' that allows the unstable modes to grow and provides the trapping at the boundaries , as illustrated by the structure of the `` potential '' in figure [ fig : potens ] .",
    "the corotation radius occurs within this potential well .      in paper i",
    "we have already given a necessary condition for instability with respect to 2d non - axisymmetric disturbances , that is , for a key function @xmath251 to have a local extreme , where @xmath252 is the potential vorticity , @xmath253 is the entropy .",
    "this is a generalized rayleigh criterion which was originally derived for incompressible flows ( cf .",
    "most of studies on pp instability have assumed homentropic flow where entropy of the whole fluid system is a constant .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath3 in equation ( [ eq : inst - cond ] ) makes it perhaps more applicable to real astrophysical disks where entropy is usually not a constant .",
    "as we have shown in this paper , the onset of the rwi , however , does not depend on having an entropy gradient . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown in paper i and by the comparison of ` hsj ' and ` nsj ' cases , temperature variation is more effective in causing the instability .",
    "furthermore , entropy gradient introduces more features into the problem , most notably that the potential vorticity of the flow is no longer conserved due to the net thermodynamic driving of vorticity from the fact that @xmath254 ( see paper i ) .      in order to evaluate the angular momentum transport from this instability ,",
    "it is necessary to evaluate terms which include _ second _ order terms .",
    "however , the present linear theory is valid only to first order . instead of the angular momentum transport",
    ", we calculate the reynolds stress derived from the velocity perturbations @xmath255 . this term is expected to be important for the angular momentum transport .",
    "the reynolds stress at each radius can be calculated as , by averaging over @xmath178 , @xmath256 @xmath257~~.\\ ] ] the result is shown in figure [ fig : reys ] for the ` hgb ' case with @xmath217 ( results for ` hsj ' and ` nsj ' cases are similar ) .",
    "this instability indeed causes a mainly positive reynolds stress which corresponds to an outward transport .    a full evaluation of the angular momentum and matter transport due to the rwi evidently requires non - linear hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we have begun to perform these simulations and will present our findings in a forthcoming paper ( li , lovelace , & colgate 1999 ) .",
    "briefly , we have observed the production of largescale 2d vortices in the @xmath229 plane and these vortices are observed to survive the shear flow for many revolutions of the disk ( @xmath258 ) .",
    "there is also indication of outward angular momentum transport , which shows promises for this instability being a robust mechanism of angular momentum transport .",
    "one important point we want to emphasize is that the transport process regulated by these large scale vortices is inviscid , highly dynamic and nonlocal .",
    "this is fundamentally different from the standard @xmath43 disk models where the flow is assumed to be _ viscous _ , hence the transport is at small scale ( i.e. , local ) and a quasi - stationary state can usually be reached .",
    "in fact , the notion of a statistically stationary @xmath43 value and stationary accretion may be an incorrect physical picture for the accretion in some highly variable systems such as x - ray binaries .",
    "we have developed a detailed linear theory of the rossby wave instability associated with an axisymmetric , local surface density jump or bump in a thin accretion disk .",
    "the instability is termed rossby due to its wkb dispersion relation which is analogous to that for rossby waves in planetary atmospheres .",
    "rossby vortices associated with the waves are well known in planetary atmospheres and give rise for example to the giant red spot on jupiter ( sommeria , meyers , & swinney 1988 ; marcus 1989 , 1990 ) .",
    "the flow is made unstable due to the existence of local extreme value of a generalized potential vorticity @xmath22 which includes the radial variation of entropy .",
    "depending on the parameters , the unstable modes are found to have substantial growth rates @xmath259 , where @xmath40 is the location of enhanced surface density gradient .",
    "these modes are capable of transporting angular momentum outward .",
    "since this instability relies on pressure forces perturbing the rotational flow , it requires a minimum sound speed , or a local `` heat '' content .",
    "we expect that the disk must be optically thick in order for the instability to be important .",
    "it is important to understand the nonlinear interactions between this instability and the rest of the disk , and to see whether the instability is effective in transporting angular momentum globally .",
    "an important aspect of the present instability is that the unstable modes propagate into the surrounding stable disk flow , thus allowing the instability to impact a large part of the disk .",
    "we have performed preliminary nonlinear hydro simulations of this instability and will report the detailed results in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the simulations have confirmed the the linear growth of the rossby wave instability and they have shown the vortices have long lifetimes ( many orbital periods ) ."
