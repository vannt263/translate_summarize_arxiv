    "gravitational wave _ chirps _ emitted by compact binary stars in their adiabatic inspiral phase will be primary targets for the early operation of broadband laser - interferometric detectors like tama300 , geo600 , ligo and virgo @xcite .",
    "these signals have been thoroughly studied and accurately modeled @xcite .",
    "the maximum - likelihood strategy @xcite for detecting signals of known shape ( except for a set of unknown parameters ) in additive stationary colored gaussian noise consists in correlating the data with a set @xmath0 of possible expected waveforms ( _ templates _ ) , and using the largest correlator as a detection statistic @xcite .",
    "the mentioned correlators are the ( noise - weighted ) scalar products : a , g = 2 , [ eq : correlator ] where @xmath1 is the antenna spectral window , @xmath2 are the noise - corrupted ( spectral ) data , @xmath3 is a ( possibly null ) signal , @xmath4 is a realization of the antenna noise with ( one - sided ) power spectral density @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a template , and @xmath7 denotes complex - conjugation .    the issue of optimum placement of the templates in the waveform parameter - space is more or less obviously a crucial and still open one , and has been addressed by several authors @xcite-@xcite .    at fixed false - alarm probability ,",
    "the detection probability is an increasing function of the _ overlap _ ( h , g)= 1 [ eq : overlap ] between the signal @xmath8 and the template @xmath9 , where the norm @xmath10 .",
    "the template set @xmath11 should be designed in such a way that , for any admissible signal @xmath8 , the overlap never drops below a prescribed value @xmath12 , which can be immediately related to the fraction @xmath13 of potentially observable sources which might be missed out @xcite .",
    "the overlap can be readily maximized w.r.t .",
    "the ( unknown but irrelevant ) initial - phase and coalescency - time differences between the signal and the template @xcite .",
    "the resulting partially - maximized overlap is called the _ match _ , is denoted by @xmath14 , and is a function of the source and template _ intrinsic _ parameters only ( e.g. , at 2.5pn order , the binary companion - masses , spin - spin and spin - orbit parameters ) . the minimum - overlap condition rephrases obviously into the following minimal - match prescription : h ,   g  :   m(h , g ) , [ eq : min_mat ] where @xmath15 is the set of admissible signals .",
    "discussion will be henceforth restricted to the @xmath16 parameter - space of spin - free chirp - waveforms , in view of the widespread present consensus that these should be adequate for the early operation of interferometric detectors @xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall denote as @xmath17 the ( 2d , spin - free ) parameter - space point corresponding to waveform @xmath9 .",
    "we shall also denote as @xmath18 the match contour - line , whose points represent the set of waveforms @xmath8 such that @xmath19 , and as @xmath20 the 2d - region bounded by @xmath18 , representing the set of waveforms @xmath8 such that @xmath21 .",
    "the template set @xmath22 should fulfill the following basic requirements .",
    "first of all , * ( a ) * the minimal - match condition ( [ eq : min_mat ] ) should be met , which re - phrases into _",
    "i s_(g_i ) , [ eq : min_mat0 ] where @xmath23 is the image of @xmath15 i.e. , the subset of the waveform parameter - space corresponding to admissible sources .",
    "pictorially , ( [ eq : min_mat0 ] ) means that the patches @xmath24 should cover the whole set @xmath23 without leaving holes . at the same time , * ( b ) * the template set @xmath25 should be chosen _ as much sparse as possible _ , so as to minimize the overall number of templates , and hence the detection threshold - level , for any prescribed false - alarm probability @xcite",
    ".    it might be further desirable * ( c ) * to deal with a set @xmath25 forming a regular ( or piecewise - regular ) grid , for computational ease .",
    "a further template - placement requirement is also worth mentioning . when covering @xmath23 with ( regularly spaced or patch - wise regularly spaced ) templates , a certain amount of template spill - over beyond @xmath26 is unavoidable .",
    "the post-1pn spin - free waveform parameter - space subset @xmath23 corresponding to admissible sources , for which @xmath27 , is a three - vertex curved - side @xmath16 domain .",
    "spill - over across the @xmath28 boundary line of @xmath23 ( equal - mass boundary - line ) is a true _ penalty _ , and thus * ( d ) *",
    "should be kept to a minimum .",
    "this is not the case for the other two boundary lines of @xmath23 , where points beyond @xmath26 could well correspond to _ possible _ ( though unlikely ) sources .    at _ large _ values of the minimal",
    "match , e.g. typically @xmath29 , as prescribed for a single - step search strategy @xcite , the match is very well approximated by a _",
    "function @xcite of the distance between @xmath30 and @xmath17 in parameter - space , and the ( approximate ) match contour - lines @xmath18 are ellipses .",
    "however when using post-1pn order waveforms ( which will be required in a one - step search to achieve the prescribed _",
    "large _ minimal - match levels @xcite ) , as @xmath17 moves throughout @xmath23 , the above ellipses rotate and stretch as an effect of the _ intrinsic _ nonzero curvature of @xmath23 .",
    "an effective procedure for constructing a @xmath16 spin - free post-1pn template set appropriate to this case has been formulated in @xcite , as a generalization of the 1pn strategy introduced in @xcite .",
    "the simplest rectangular - cell template - lattice is chosen , and the span of template @xmath31 ( i.e. , the set of points representing waveforms for which @xmath32 ) is accordingly taken as the largest rectangle inscribed in the minimal - match contour - line @xmath33 . in order to minimize spill - over across the equal - mass boundary - line of @xmath23 , while optimizing template placement for equal - mass sources ( which are credited to be most abundant @xcite ) ,",
    "the algorithm is started by placing a sufficient number of templates along the equal - mass boundary line .",
    "the nearest - neighboring templates are placed in such a way that the boundaries of their rectangular spans _ touch _ without intersecting . as a result @xmath23",
    "is covered with a set of patches , each of which is a stack of equal - width rectangles , whose height changes according to the shear / stretch of the elliptical @xmath34 contour - lines .",
    "the current release of grasp @xcite implements a similar procedure , resulting into a relatively straightforward template placement algorithm .",
    "as already noted in @xcite the above algorithm is _ not _ optimal , i.e. , it does not necessarily satisfy requirement * ( b ) * , in view of its _ a - priori _ restriction to rectangular cells @xcite .",
    "the template placement issue becomes even more complicated at low minimal - match levels ( e.g. , typically @xmath35 ) as prescribed in the first step(s ) of hierarchical search strategies . in multi - step",
    "hierarchical searches a _ single _ template - lattice @xmath25 designed to achieve a _",
    "@xmath12 throughout @xmath23 is constructed . in the first step",
    "only the correlators corresponding to a suitably _ decimated _ subset of @xmath25 are computed , covering @xmath23 at a _ lower _ minimal - match level . in the second step ,",
    "only a limited number of correlators , corresponding to a few non - decimated subsets of @xmath25 need to be actually computed , covering suitable neighbourhood(s ) of the candidate signals discovered in the first step .",
    "multi - step hierarchical search strategies should allow a sizeable reduction in the required computing power @xcite-@xcite .",
    "mohanty @xcite formulated a simple strategy for evaluating the lattice decimation - steps ( taken as constant throughout extended patches of the lattice ) for a post-1pn template lattice .",
    "also in this case , however , requirement * ( b ) * will be most certainly violated . by itself ,",
    "the template placement issue at low minimal - match levels is further complicated by the fact that the match contour - lines @xmath18 besides varying with @xmath17 are _ no longer _ elliptical .",
    "for this reason , the procedure expounded in @xcite can only be validated by extensive monte - carlo trials .    in this rapid communication",
    "we present a possible way to get rid of all the above difficulties and limitations , by capitalizing on the remarkable properties of the post-1pn waveform parametrization introduced by tanaka and tagoshi @xcite , and further discussed in @xcite .",
    "we accordingly introduce a simple and systematic procedure to set up an optimum template - lattice @xcite , which closely fulfills _ all _ conditions * a ) * , * b ) * and * c ) * above , at _ any _ prescribed minimal - match level @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 the tanaka - tagoshi parametrization and its relevant properties , including the main features of the match contour - lines , are briefly introduced . in sect .",
    "3 our optimum template placement procedure is exposed in detail . in sect .",
    "4 the gain achievable by cardinal interpolation among these optimally - placed templates is discussed .",
    "conclusions follow under section 5 .",
    "the tanaka - tagoshi transformation @xcite is a linear one - to - one mapping @xmath36 between the ( 2d , spin - free , post-1pn ) admissible waveform parameter - space @xmath23 and a _ globally flat _",
    "manifold @xmath37 such that : i ) the ratio = | | [ eq : match_error ] is _ negligibly small _",
    "( typically of the order of @xmath38 @xcite ) and , ii ) @xmath39 depends _ only _ on the _ distance _ between @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the tanaka - tagoshi construction is effective for all first generation interferometers @xcite .    clearly , property i ) above allows to solve the optimum template placement problem in the _ globally flat _",
    "manifold @xmath37 , by finding a set @xmath42 such that : _",
    "i s_(_i ) .",
    "[ eq : min_mat1 ] on the other hand , property ii ) implies that the sets @xmath43 are _ identical _ up to trivial translations .",
    "this means that @xmath44 is a _ globally uniform _ template lattice , featuring a _ regular grid _ of nodes , at _ any _ prescribed minimal - match level .",
    "the match contour - lines @xmath45 in the ( dimensionless ) tanaka - tagoshi ( spin - free ) waveform parameter - space coordinates @xmath46 have different geometrical features , depending on the value of @xmath12 . in fig .",
    "1 the inverse of the curvature radius @xmath47 of @xmath45 is displayed as a function of the polar angle @xmath48 around @xmath41 for several representative values of @xmath12 , for ligo - i at 2.5pn order .",
    "the contour - lines @xmath34 are also shown in the insets , where @xmath49 .    in the limit as @xmath50",
    "the contour - lines @xmath34 are asymptotically circular and @xmath51 is almost constant .",
    "see , e.g. , the @xmath52 contour - line in fig . 1 top - left .    in a range @xmath53 , the contour - lines @xmath34 deviate from circular , but still remain _ globally convex_. for ligo - i , @xmath54 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath51 remains _ non negative _ throughout a full rotation around @xmath41 .",
    "see , e.g. , the @xmath55 contour - line in fig . 1 top - right .    for @xmath56 , the @xmath34 contour - lines are _ no longer globally convex_. in a range @xmath57 , they consist simply of two convex @xcite arcs and two concave ones joining smoothly , to form a `` peanut '' shape .",
    "see e.g. the @xmath58 contour - line in fig . 1 bottom - left .",
    "for ligo - i , @xmath59 . as @xmath12 is decreased below @xmath60 , the contour - lines become more and more complicated , as more and more bumps and dents do appear .",
    "correspondingly , the boundary curvature @xmath51 exhibits more and more turning points throughout a full rotation around @xmath41 .",
    "see , e.g. , the @xmath61 contour - line in fig . 1 bottom - right .    for all values of @xmath12 , the surface",
    "@xmath62 has always a centre of symmetry in @xmath41 .",
    "in the following we shall discuss the optimum template placement strategy for each of the above mentioned minimal - match ranges .",
    "optimum here and henceforth means that requirements * ( a ) * , * ( b ) * and * ( c ) * discussed in sect .",
    "1 will be strictly fulfilled @xcite .      in the asymptotic limit @xmath50 ,",
    "the match contour - lines are circular .",
    "rotational symmetry of the match contour - lines implies that the templates should sit at the vertices of _ regular _ polygons in the waveform parameter - space .",
    "these regular ( open ) polygons should besides make up a ( regular ) _ tiling _ of the ( tanaka - tagoshi ) plane @xcite , and hence can only be triangles , squares or hexagons .",
    "let @xmath63 be one such polygon , and @xmath64 its vertices .",
    "the sparsest templates satisfying ( [ eq : min_mat1 ] ) are such that the circles @xmath65 touch at a _ single _",
    "point @xmath66 , which is obviously the center of symmetry of @xmath63 .",
    "this means that the curve @xmath67 goes through all the @xmath68 s .",
    "hence , the templates should be located at the vertices of a regular triangle , square or hexagon inscribed in a circle @xmath34 .",
    "the obvious question is which polygon is _ best _ in terms of the total number of templates needed to cover the admissible - waveform parameter - space @xmath37 in the tanaka - tagoshi plane .",
    "clearly , the best polygon will be the one for which the _ span _ of each ( and any ) template has the largest measure ( area ) @xcite .    the span ( or , in more technical language , the voronoi set @xcite ) of @xmath68 is the set of points @xmath40 for which @xmath69 , which are the images in the tanaka - tagoshi plane of those waveforms @xmath8 which will be detected using template @xmath70 .",
    "the voronoi sets are shown shaded in fig .",
    "2 , for the ( regular ) triangular , square and hexagonal tilings of the ( tanaka - tagoshi ) plane @xcite .",
    "a choice can be made on the basis of a comparison among the measures ( areas ) of the pertinent voronoi sets .",
    "let @xmath71 denote the measure ( area ) , @xmath72 the @xmath73-gonal tiling - cell , and @xmath74 the corresponding voronoi set .",
    "it is readily seen that @xcite : = 1.299037 ,   = 0.649519 , [ eq : tile_comp ] the triangular tiling is thus seen to be the best choice , yielding a gain in terms of template - span of @xmath75 , whereas the hexagonal one features a loss of @xmath76 , w.r.t .",
    "the simples square tiling @xcite .",
    "the triangular _ tiling _ yields a template _",
    "whose fundamental domain ( lattice - cell ) is a parallelogram @xcite .",
    "only three vertices of any lattice - cell belong to a single curve @xmath34 .      in the range @xmath77 , the contour - lines @xmath45 are no longer circles , but still _ globally - convex _ and center - symmetric .",
    "circular symmetry being lost , we shall still seek the sparsest template collocation subject to ( [ eq : min_mat1 ] ) among the non - regular , but still center - symmetric ( open ) @xmath73-gons ( @xmath78 ) with all vertices on @xmath34 , which tile the tanaka - tagoshi plane .",
    "it makes sense to compare for this case the template - span ( voronoi set ) measures ( areas ) @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath78 to the template - span measure ( area ) @xmath80 $ ] of the square tiling @xcite pertinent to the naive ( but usual ) approximation of circular match contour - lines .",

    "we shall still seek the optimum tiling of tanaka - tagoshi plane using the ( open ) triangles with ( all ) vertices on @xmath34 .",
    "however , the match contour - lines being no longer globally convex , the _ largest - area _ triangle inscribed in @xmath34 does _ not _ necessarily cope with eq .",
    "( [ eq : min_mat1 ] ) , as e.g. exemplified in fig .",

    "7 as a function of @xmath12 , together with the number of templates needed to cover the companion - mass range @xmath94 , for a number of representative minimal - match values .",
    "in recent papers it has been shown that a sensible reduction ( @xmath95 for 1pn and higher - pn - order templates ) in the number of correlators to be computed in order to achieve a prescribed minimal - match can be obtained using cardinal interpolation , thanks to the quasi - band - limited property of the match function @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained under the simplest assumption of a square - cell template - lattice .",
    "two obvious questions are now in order : i ) whether / to what extent cardinal interpolation is still effective when using the optimum triangular - tiling discussed in the previous sections @xcite , and ii ) whether / to what extent cardinal interpolation is still useful at relatively low @xmath12 values , as needed in the early step(s ) of hierarchical searches .",
    "numerical simulations have been run to clarify both issues .    in fig .",
    "8 the template density reduction @xcite obtained by cardinal interpolation among optimally - placed templates is displayed as a function of the prescribed minimal - match @xmath12 . in the inset of fig .",
    "8 , the ( boosted ) minimal - match values obtained after cardinal interpolation among the optimally - placed templates corresponding to a number of representative values of @xmath12 are also listed .    at @xmath83",
    "a template density reduction @xmath96 is obtained . the apparent discrepancy between this value and the one reported in @xcite",
    "is readily explained . the template density required to achieve a prescribed minimal - match when",
    "using cardinal interpolation is essentially independent from the _ shape _ of the lattice fundamental - domain , depending only on its _ measure _ ( area ) , according to the well - known nyquist - rate condition @xcite .",
    "thus , the template density reduction @xmath97 in @xcite , @xcite when using the simplest square - cell lattice is seen to result from two factors : a factor @xmath96 , expressing the template density reduction due to cardinal interpolation when using the _ optimum _ triangular - tiling , times a factor @xmath98 expressing the template density reduction implied in using the optimum triangular - tiling instead of the simplest square one .",
    "we presented a simple and systematic procedure for constructing the sparsest lattice of templates subject to a given minimal - match constraint in the range between @xmath99 down to @xmath100 ( and below ) in the ( spin - free ) tanaka - tagoshi parameter - space of post-1pn gravitational wave chirps .",
