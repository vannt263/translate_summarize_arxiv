    "it is known since long ago that some non - hermitian operators may exhibit real eigenvalues@xcite .",
    "this fact remained a somewhat exotic mathematical subject till bender and boettcher@xcite suggested that those operators may exhibit unbroken parity - time ( pt ) symmetry . from then on the problem quickly developed into a prolific field of research@xcite ( and references therein ) .    in a roughly general way we may say that most of the studied problems are represented by hamiltonian operators of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is parity - invariant @xmath9 and @xmath10 is parity antisymmetric @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the parity operator .",
    "if @xmath13 is imaginary ( where @xmath2 is obviously real ) then @xmath14 is pt symmetric : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the time - reversal operator@xcite .    in the beginning ,",
    "most of the models studied were mainly one - dimensional@xcite in which case",
    "@xmath0 only exhibits parity symmetry and its eigenfunctions @xmath17 are even or odd : @xmath18 but later the researchers began to look for multidimensional examples@xcite .",
    "it was suggested that space - time ( st ) symmetry could be a suitable generalization of the pt one@xcite . in this case @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a unitary operator such that @xmath22 .",
    "most of the effort was devoted to find new multidimensional non - hermitian hamiltonians with real spectra .",
    "in the multidimensional case @xmath0 and @xmath3 may exhibit more complex symmetry that is conveniently described by means of group theory . in this way fernndez and garcia@xcite and amore",
    "et al@xcite found that some st - symmetric hamiltonians exhibit broken st symmetry for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "the main conjecture was that st symmetry may be unbroken for some values of @xmath2 provided that @xmath21 is the only member of a class in the point group for @xmath0@xcite .",
    "this appeared to be the case when @xmath23 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the discussion of three pt - symmetric hamiltonians for which @xmath24 exhibits central - field symmetry and @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian @xmath3 exhibits cylindrical symmetry and may be viewed as a kind of stark effect with imaginary electric field . in section  [ sec : ptsymmetry ] we outline the main ideas of pt symmetry as well as a simple argument based on perturbation theory@xcite . in section  [ sec : stark_gen ] we briefly discuss the general case . in sections [ sec : ho ] , [ sec : ha ] and [ sec : linear ] we show that the models with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , respectively , exhibit completely different spectra .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the main results of the paper and draw conclusions .",
    "let @xmath29 be the antiunitary operator given by the product of the parity @xmath12 and time - reversal @xmath16 operators@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian operator @xmath3 is said to be @xmath30 symmetric if @xmath31    if @xmath32 then @xmath33 if @xmath34 , @xmath35 being a complex number , then we say that pt symmetry is unbroken and @xmath36 .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that @xmath37 .",
    "fernndez and garcia@xcite found a case in which @xmath38 and still @xmath39 is real .",
    "they proposed the supposedly more general condition @xmath40 for the occurrence of real spectrum ; that is to say , when @xmath41 and @xmath42 are two linearly independent eigenfunctions of @xmath3 with the same eigenvalue @xmath39 . this situation does not take place unless the spectrum of @xmath3 is degenerate .",
    "however , further analysis reveals that both conditions are equivalent .",
    "in fact , if we choose @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then @xmath46 .",
    "it is worth adding that none of these conditions is of practical utility to predict whether @xmath3 will have real eigenvalues or not because one commonly ignores the effect of @xmath47 on the eigenvectors of @xmath3 .",
    "most of the examples studied so far are of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath13 , where @xmath2 is real . since @xmath50 then @xmath51 .",
    "some useful information on the spectrum of @xmath3 is given by the perturbation series @xmath52 because if at least one coefficient of odd order @xmath53 is nonzero then @xmath39 is expected to be complex for sufficiently small @xmath2 .",
    "in such a case the pt - phase transition@xcite takes place at the trivial hermitian limit @xmath54 .",
    "if we write @xmath55 then @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath57 and @xmath58 are linearly dependent , then @xmath59 and all the perturbation corrections of odd order vanish ; otherwise @xmath60 , @xmath61 and we can not draw a conclusion so easily . the latter case may only take place when the spectrum of @xmath3 is degenerate .",
    "in many cases it suffices to calculate the simplest , straightforward perturbation correction of first order @xmath62@xcite .",
    "consider the hamiltonian operator @xmath63 where @xmath64 is spherically symmetric ( depends only on @xmath5 ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath65 @xmath66 are also eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operators @xmath67 and @xmath68@xmath69 in spherical coordinates the eigenfunctions can be factored as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the radial part , @xmath72 , is the radial quantum number and @xmath73 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "since the eigenvalues of @xmath0 do not depend on @xmath74 they are at least @xmath75-fold degenerate .",
    "the perturbation @xmath25 breaks the degeneracy of the spectrum of @xmath0 but the states with @xmath76 remain two - fold degenerate because the eigenvalues of @xmath3 do not depend on the sign of the magnetic quantum number @xmath77 .    since @xmath78 and @xmath79 the matrix elements @xmath80 are zero when @xmath81 is even .",
    "the perturbation corrections of first order to the energy @xmath82 are given by the eigenvalues of the matrix with elements @xmath83 .",
    "we will discuss three examples in the subsequent sections .",
    "when    @xmath84    the schrdinger equation is exactly solvable and the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an eigenfunction of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath87 .    since @xmath88 then the pt symmetry is unbroken for all @xmath2 which accounts for the fact that the eigenvalues in equation ( [ eq : iho_eigenv_eigenf ] ) are real for all @xmath2 .",
    "although in this case the approximate analysis based on perturbation theory may appear to be unnecessary we carry it out anyway merely for comparison purposes . to begin with ,",
    "note that @xmath89 .",
    "the perturbation correction of first order to a given energy level @xmath90 is given by matrix elements of the form @xmath91 that vanish for all degenerate states because @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , @xmath93 for all the states of the pt stark effect in the isotropic harmonic oscillator .",
    "this result is consistent with the form of the exact eigenvalues ( [ eq : iho_eigenv_eigenf ] ) that depend on @xmath94 .",
    "there is another way to prove that the pt symmetry for this problem remains unbroken for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "the proof is based on the fact that @xmath3 can be written in terms of a similarity transformation of @xmath0 : @xmath95 where @xmath96 . obviously , @xmath0 and @xmath97 are isospectral@xcite .",
    "the unperturbed eigenvalues for the coulomb interaction @xmath98 are given by @xmath99 therefore , there are pairs of degenerate states @xmath100 , @xmath101 for which @xmath102 is odd and the corresponding matrix elements @xmath103 ( [ eq : z_mat_el ] ) are nonzero . in such cases , which for real @xmath104 give rise to what is commonly known as linear stark effect@xcite , the perturbation correction of first order is nonzero and the eigenvalues of @xmath3 are complex for @xmath105 .",
    "the schrdinger equation for this problem is separable in parabolic coordinates and the exact calculation of the perturbation corrections in terms of the parabolic quantum numbers @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 is straightforward@xcite .",
    "it is customary to write the perturbation series @xmath109 in terms of the quantum numbers @xmath110 and @xmath111@xcite .",
    "all the coefficients of odd order vanish when @xmath112 but the states with @xmath113 are expected to be complex when @xmath105 .",
    "the argument based on perturbation theory just outlined is sufficient to conclude that this model exhibits complex eigenvalues when @xmath105 and that the pt phase transition@xcite takes place at the trivial hermitian limit @xmath54 .",
    "nevertheless , we will show some numerical results to illustrate the point . here",
    "we choose the most efficient method of benassi and grecchi@xcite that is based on the separation of the schrdinger equation in squared - parabolic coordinates .",
    "since the details of this approach have been given elsewhere@xcite , here we just show the results .",
    "figure  [ fig : stark ] shows the real and imaginary parts of the lowest eigenvalues .",
    "it is clear that the pt phase transition takes place at the trivial hermitian limit as already argued above .",
    "the remarkable difference between the spectra of this problem and the previous one can be traced back to the symmetry of @xmath0 .",
    "the general central - field model is invariant under the group o(3 ) while , on the other hand , the hydrogen atom is invariant under the group o(4)@xcite .",
    "such higher symmetry is due to the conservation of the runge - lenz vector in the latter model .",
    "thus , the higher symmetry of @xmath0 appears to be the reason why the pt symmetry is broken for all @xmath2 in the perturbed hydrogen atom . while the @xmath114-th harmonic - oscillator eigenvalue @xmath90 is @xmath115-fold degenerate , the @xmath116-th eigenvalue of the hydrogen atom @xmath117 is @xmath118-fold degenerate .",
    "the greater degeneracy of the latter model allows the appearance of nonzero matrix elements @xmath103 and nonzero perturbation corrections of first order .",
    "as a nontrivial example we consider the linear potential @xmath119 in this case we can not solve the eigenvalue equation for @xmath0 exactly but we can nevertheless calculate the perturbation correction of first order to any energy level @xmath120 because it is determined by matrix elements of the form @xmath121 which vanish for all sets of quantum numbers as argued in section  [ sec : stark_gen ] . therefore , @xmath122 and there is a chance that pt symmetry may be unbroken for sufficiently small @xmath2 .",
    "we can calculate approximate eigenvalues by means of diagonalization of a suitable matrix representation of the hamiltonian . for simplicity , here we choose the nonorthogonal slater - type basis set @xmath123 present numerical results show that this problem exhibits the usual spectral pattern common to most pt - symmetric hamiltonians studied by other authors ; that is to say , unbroken pt symmetry for @xmath6 . for sufficiently small values of @xmath2",
    "the eigenvalues are real .",
    "as @xmath2 increases two eigenvalues approach each other , coalesce at an exceptional point@xcite @xmath124 becoming a pair of complex conjugate numbers for @xmath125 .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated by figures [ fig : rzm0 ] , [ fig : rzm1 ] and [ fig : rzm2 ] , for @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "those results were obtained by diagonalization of the matrix representation of the hamiltonian operator in the slater basis set ( [ eq : basis_slater ] ) with @xmath127 .",
    "the irregular lines reflect errors in the calculation of the eigenvalues originated in the quasi linear dependence of the basis set .",
    "this shortcoming of the present approach becomes more noticeable as the number of radial basis functions increases .",
    "although our numerical results are not extremely accurate and are restricted to the lowest eigenvalues for the reason just indicated , they appear to suggest that the smallest exceptional point @xmath128 may be nonzero and that there is a pt phase transition at such point .",
    "we think that a more accurate calculation is not necessary to illustrate the difference between this model and the other two ones discussed above .",
    "in this paper we have discussed three hamiltonians given by three different central - field hermitian parts and the same non - hermitian pt - symmetric perturbation .",
    "although at first sight they appear to be similar , they exhibit completely different spectra . in the case of the isotropic harmonic oscillator",
    "the pt symmetry is unbroken and the spectrum is real for all @xmath2 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath3 and @xmath0 are related by the similarity transformation ( [ eq : similarity ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the pt symmetry is broken for all @xmath2 in the case of the hydrogen atom .",
    "quite in between the linear radial potential appears to exhibit unbroken pt symmetry for all @xmath6 and a phase transition at some @xmath128 that we were unable to determine .",
    "the remarkable difference among the spectra of such seemingly similar hamiltonians is due to the symmetry of @xmath0 . as a general rule",
    "the higher the symmetry of @xmath0 the more likely the occurrence of complex eigenvalues and the hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom exhibits the greatest symmetry by far .",
    "we have already discussed the effect of symmetry in earlier papers@xcite but we have not seen such a remarkable difference in the behaviour of the non - hermitian hamiltonians .    in closing we want to stress the fact that perturbation theory provides a useful hint about the nature of the spectra of a given non - hermitian hamiltonian . if a perturbation correction of odd order ( we typically look for the first one ) is nonzero then we know that the spectrum is complex for all values of @xmath2 ( or at least for sufficiently small @xmath2 ) .",
    "if all the available perturbation corrections of odd order are zero then there is a chance of finding real spectrum for some values of @xmath2 .",
    "obviously , this case should be investigated by more accurate calculations . as the symmetry of @xmath0 increases , then also increases the dimension of its eigenspaces and , consequently , the dimension of the matrix representation of the perturbation in those eigenspaces . as a result it also increases the chance of nonzero perturbation corrections of first order .",
