    "academic research in peer - to - peer ( p2p ) systems has concentrated largely on algorithms to improve the efficiency  @xcite , scalability  @xcite , robustness  @xcite , and security  @xcite of query routing in p2p systems , services such as indexing and search  @xcite , and dissemination  @xcite for applications running on top of these systems , or even all of the above  @xcite .",
    "while these improvements may be essential to enhancing the performance of some p2p applications , there has been little focus on what makes an application `` p2p - worthy , '' or on which other , previously ignored applications may benefit from a p2p solution .",
    "what questions should an application designer ask to judge whether a p2p solution is appropriate for his particular problem ?    in this position paper",
    ", we hope to stimulate the discussion by distilling the experience of a broad range of proposed and deployed p2p systems into a methodology for judging how suitable a p2p architecture might be for a particular problem . in section  [",
    "sec : characteristics ] , we identify some salient characteristic axes in typical distributed problems . in section  [ sec : problems ] , we describe a spectrum of specific problems for which p2p solutions have been proposed . in section  [ sec : decision ] , we propose an arrangement of problem characteristics into a heuristic decision tree .",
    "we walk through the tree explaining its choices and why we believe certain paths may lead to successful p2p solutions to important problems , while other paths may encounter difficulties .",
    "in this section , we describe the characteristics of distributed problems we believe are important in assessing their p2p - worthiness .",
    "as seems to be the consensus in the research community  @xcite , we identify as peer - to - peer those environments that satisfy the following three criteria :    * _ self - organizing _ : nodes organize themselves into a network through a process in which they discover other peers . * _ symmetric communication _ : peers are considered equals ; they both request and offer services , rather than being confined to either client or server roles . *",
    "_ decentralized _ : there is neither a global directory nor a central controller dictating behavior to individual nodes . instead , peers rely on communication with each other for discovery of other peers , resources and services , and determine their course of action autonomously .",
    "our axes are the problem s budget , the relevance of resources to individual peers , the rate of system change , the level of mutual trust , and the criticality of the resources handled . in more detail :    * budget * : if the budget for a solution is ample , a designer is unlikely to consider worthwhile the inefficiencies , latencies and testing problems of a p2p solution .",
    "if the budget is limited , a key motivator in the choice of p2p architectures is the lowest possible cost of entry for individual peers , despite increased total system cost . assembling a system from local , often surplus ,",
    "components can be justified as a small part of many budgets and may be the only feasible approach .",
    "* resource relevance to participants * : relevance is the probability that a peer is interested in data from other peers . if it is high , p2p cooperation evolves naturally .",
    "if it is low , artificial or extrinsic incentives may be needed .",
    "* trust * : mutual distrust between peers may be essential to the problem or of little concern .",
    "however , the cost of mutual distrust in p2p systems is high and needs to be justified by specific problem requirements .",
    "* rate of system change * : the participants , resources and parameters of the system may be stable or rapidly changing .",
    "rapid change in p2p systems can make it difficult to provide consistency guarantees and defenses against flooding and other attacks .",
    "* criticality * : if the problem being solved is critical to the users , they may demand centralized control irrespective of technical criteria . even if p2p is not ruled out , the need for expensive security or massive over - provisioning may make it uneconomic .",
    "we have excluded other characteristics which , while important , did not affect the decision tree as far as we have elaborated it . among these",
    "are whether the resources are public or private , whether the resources are naturally distributed , whether the time horizon of the application is long or short , and whether participants are homogeneous or heterogeneous .",
    "our candidate problems for a p2p architecture come from routing , backup , monitoring , data sharing , data dissemination , and auditing .",
    "all distributed systems need a routing layer to get messages to their intended recipients .",
    "routing takes on p2p characteristics when the scale is large enough ( e.g. , the internet ) or when centralization is ruled out ( e.g. , wireless ad hoc networks ) .",
    "internet routers must communicate to cope with dynamically changing network topology to determine how to route outbound packets to their destination .",
    "they are arranged into `` autonomous systems '' which `` peer '' with each other across organizational boundaries , frequently between competitors .",
    "routing protocols have historically assumed that economic incentives and legal contracts are sufficient to discourage misbehavior . at the application layer ( e.g. , resilient overlay networks ( ron )  @xcite ) or at the network layer ( e.g. , bgp  @xcite ) , routers trust information from known peers .",
    "they cooperate because the information being exchanged is of interest to all peers and important to their function .",
    "this cooperation tends to fail if error , misbehavior or usage patterns cause the data to change too fast . to scale to the size of the internet , bgp tries to limit the rate of change by aggregating routes instead of having isps propagate internal routing updates .",
    "aggregation reduces the ability to detect path outages quickly  @xcite .",
    "ron instead gives up scaling to large numbers of nodes in favor of more fine - grained route information exchanges .",
    "the ad hoc routing problem is to use transient resources , such as the wireless communication devices of a disaster recovery crew , to deploy temporary network infrastructure for a specific purpose . because each individual node s wireless range does not reach all other nodes , peers in the network forward packets on behalf of each other .",
    "the costly alternative is to provide more permanent infrastructure for all possible eventualities in all possible locations .",
    "the network is of relevance and critical to all participants , and pre - configured security can give a high level of mutual trust .",
    "once established , the participants ( humans in the crew ) typically change and move slowly , and do not exchange huge volumes of data .",
    "ad hoc routing has also been proposed in less critical settings , such as that of public , ad hoc cellular telephony in dense metropolitan areas .",
    "the motivation is to reduce the costs of deploying enough base stations and to avoid payment for air time where traffic does not pass through base stations . unlike the disaster recovery problem",
    ", the participants do not trust each other , they change and move rapidly , and their local resources such as battery power are limited . in its current state , this problem suffers from the  tragedy of the commons \"  @xcite .",
    "we doubt that a practical p2p solution to this problem exists , unless either on - going research  @xcite devises strong , `` strategy - proof '' mechanisms to combat selfishness , or the scope of the problem is limited to close - knit communities with `` built - in '' incentives for participation .",
    "backup , the process in which a user replicates his files in different media at different locations to increase data survivability , can benefit greatly from the pooling of otherwise underutilized resources .",
    "unfortunately , the fact that each peer is interested only in its own data opens the way to selfish peer behavior .",
    "the cost of backup could be reduced if internet - wide cooperation  @xcite could be incentivized and enforced .",
    "for example in samsara  @xcite peers must hold real or simulated data equivalent to the space other peers hold for them .",
    "but there is no guarantee an untrusted node will provide backup data when requested , even if it has passed periodic checks to ensure it still has those data .",
    "such a misbehaving or faulty node may in turn have its backup data elsewhere dropped in retaliation .",
    "if misbehaving , it may already have anticipated this reaction and , if faulty , it is exactly why it would participate in a backup scheme in the first place .",
    "we believe that data backup is poorly suited for a p2p environment running across trust boundaries .",
    "in contrast , when participants enjoy high mutual trust , e.g. , within the confines of an enterprise intranet , p2p backup makes sense ( hivecache  @xcite is one such commercial offering ) .",
    "this is because selfish behavior is unlikely when a sense of trusting community or a top - down corporate mandate impose participation , obviating the need for enforceable compliance incentives .",
    "monitoring is an important task in any large distributed system .",
    "it may have simple needs such as `` subscribing '' to first - order events and expecting notification when those events are `` published '' ( e.g. , scribe  @xcite ) ; it may involve more complicated , on - line manipulation , for instance via sql queries , of complex distributed data streams such as network packet traces , cpu loads , virus signatures ( as in the on - line network monitoring problem motivating pier  @xcite ) ; it may be the basis for an off - line , post mortem longitudinal study of many , high - volume data streams , such as the longitudinal network studies performed by fomenkov et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although the abstract monitoring problem is characterized by natural distribution of the data sources monitored , specific instances of the problem vary vastly .",
    "a longitudinal off - line network study , though important , is not necessarily critical to its recipients , and has low timeliness and rate - of - change constraints .",
    "in contrast , an isp may consider the on - line , on - time monitoring of its resources and those of its neighbors extremely critical for its survival .",
    "similarly , the mechanisms for complex network monitoring described by huebsch et al .  @xcite may be appropriate for administratively closed , high - trust environments such as planetlab , and they may be quite inappropriate in environments lacking mutual trust and rife with fraud or subversion ; whereas an off - line long - term network study affords its investigators more time for data validation against tampering .        in file sharing systems , participants offer their local files to other peers and search collections to find interesting files .",
    "the cost of deployment is very low since most peers store only items that they are interested in anyway .",
    "resource relevance is high ; a great deal of content appeals to a large population of peers . in typical file sharing networks ,",
    "peer turnover and file addition is high , leading to a high rate of change of the system .",
    "peers trust each other to deliver the advertised content and most popular file sharing networks do not have the capacity to resist malicious peers .",
    "file sharing is mainly used to trade media content , which is not a critical application .",
    "the goal of the freenet project  @xcite is to create an anonymous , censorship - resistant data store .",
    "both publishing and document requests are routed through a mix - net and all content is encrypted by the content s creator .",
    "these steps are necessary because peers are mutually suspicious and some peers may be malicious .",
    "peers share their bandwidth as well as disk space , which puts freenet on the low end of the budget axis .",
    "freenet is intended to provide a medium for material that some group wishes to suppress , thus data are relevant to many consumers as well as attackers .",
    "it is critical that the content in the system be protected from censorship",
    ". published material does not need to be available immediately , so freenet can work with a low rate of change .",
    "tangler  @xcite has similar goals",
    ". a peer stores his document by encoding the document using erasure codes and distributing the resulting fragments throughout the community . to prevent an adversary from biasing where those fragments are distributed ,",
    "a peer must combine his document with pseudo - randomness before erasure coding ; he uses other peers documents as a source of pseudo - randomness . to retrieve his own document , a peer must store locally the randomness used at storage time , i.e. , other peers documents .",
    "although the problem lacks inherent incentives for participation , this solution ingeniously supplies them .",
    "data dissemination is akin to data sharing , with the distinction that the problem is not to _ store _ data indefinitely but , instead , to _",
    "spread _ the data for a relatively short amount of time . often storing is combined with spreading .",
    "usenet , perhaps the oldest and most successful p2p application , is a massively distributed discussion system in which users post messages to `` newsgroups . ''",
    "these articles are then disseminated to other hosts subscribing to the particular newsgroup , and made available to local users .",
    "usenet has been a staple of the internet for decades , arguably because of the low cost barrier to peer entry and the high relevance of the content to participating peers .",
    "unfortunately , although the system flourished at a time when mutual trust was assumed , it remains vulnerable to many forms of attack , perhaps jeopardizing its future in less innocent times .",
    "dissemination of programs , program updates , streaming media  @xcite , and even cooperative web caching  @xcite are all non - critical applications of content distribution .",
    "the problem involves content with generally low rates of change , although the participants may change wildly .",
    "one successful application is bittorrent  @xcite , which mitigates the congestion at the download server when a popular new program or update is posted .",
    "its tit - for - tat policy is effective despite low peer trust , and the option of postponing download until later reduces its criticality .",
    "collaborative web caching , although superficially attractive , has not succeeded . as the system scales up , relevance of the content decreases , making it less useful .",
    "when the scale is small enough to make the content relevant , the system s complexity is unjustified  @xcite .",
    "other specific instances of dissemination have been proposed to address flash crowds  @xcite which could be used to distribute critical data , such as news updates during a major disaster .",
    "the _ lockss _ system preserves academic e - journals in a network of autonomous web caches .",
    "peers each obtain their own complete replicas of the content by crawling the publisher s web site .",
    "if the content becomes unavailable from the publisher , the local copy is supplied to local readers .",
    "the replicas are preserved using a p2p protocol  @xcite that provides mutual audit and repair , but this is not time critical ; thus the rate of change is low .",
    "the content being preserved is highly relevant to many peers .",
    "the audit process uses `` opinion polls '' so that peers trust the consensus of other peers but not any individual peer .",
    "mutual distrust is essential to prevent cascade failures which could destroy every copy of the preserved content . the automatic audit and repair process allows peers to be built from cheap , unreliable hardware with very little need for administration , which is important in the budget - constrained world of libraries .",
    "a secure time stamping service  @xcite acts as the digital equivalent of a notary public : it maintains a history of the creation and contents of digital documents , allowing clients who trust the service to determine which document was `` notarized '' first .",
    "correlating the histories of multiple , mutually distrustful secure time stamping services  @xcite is important , because not everyone doing business in the world can be convinced to trust the same centralized service ; being able to map time stamps issued elsewhere to a local trust domain is essential for critical documents ( such as contracts ) from disparate jurisdictions .",
    "luckily , sensitive documents such as contracts change little or not at all at very low rates , and high latencies for obtaining or verifying secure time stamps are acceptable , facilitating the development of an _ efficient - enough _ p2p solution to the problem .",
    "figure  [ fig : decisiontree ] is a decision tree organizing our characteristics to determine whether a particular application is p2p - worthy .",
    "we examine our example applications traversing this tree in a breadth - first manner .    at the top of the tree",
    "we have the `` budget '' axis .",
    "we believe that limited budget is the most important motivator for a p2p solution . with limited budget ,",
    "the low cost for a peer to join a p2p solution is very appealing .",
    "otherwise , a centralized or centrally controlled distributed solution will provide lower complexity and higher performance for the extra money .",
    "our tree thus continues only along the `` limited '' budget end of the axis .",
    "our next most important characteristic is the `` relevance '' of the resource in question .",
    "the more relevant ( important to others ) the resource , the more motivated peers in a p2p architecture are to participate . applications of low relevance with good p2p solutions exist , but only where other inherent reasons for a p2p solution are strong , as we explain below .",
    "the next axis in the tree is `` mutual trust . ''",
    "successful p2p solutions with trusting peers exist , as do those whose other characteristics justify the performance and complexity cost of measures to cope with mutual distrust .",
    "those applications with low relevance and low trust have the burden of incentivizing cooperation . while tangler is a good example of this ,",
    "we believe that metropolitan ad hoc wireless networks and internet backup have not yet succeeded .",
    "the motivations for these applications seem inadequate to overcome the low relevance of the resources and the overheads of protecting against uncooperative or malicious peers . where peers are assumed to cooperate , applications such as corporate backup may succeed , since corporate mandate compensates for low relevance . unfortunately",
    ", no such external compensation appears to exist for cooperative web caching ; its marginal performance benefits due to low relevance at large scales renders it unnecessary  @xcite .",
    "where relevance is high , the level of trust between nodes still has an impact on the suitability of a p2p solution for the application . creating artificial economies or `` trading '' schemes to provide extrinsic incentives for cooperation ( as in mojonation ) is generally unsuccessful  @xcite .",
    "the overhead in terms of complexity and performance for managing mutually distrustful nodes suggests that applications will be difficult to implement successfully in a p2p system , unless other characteristics intercede to simplify the problem .",
    "such a characteristic is the rate of change in the system .",
    "applications with a low rate of change , such as lockss , freenet , and distributed time stamping , may succeed despite mutually distrusting peers .",
    "for these applications , mutual distrust between peers is an inherent part of the problem , and thus its cost must be born by any proposed solutions .",
    "the cost , however , is reduced by the low rate of change , which makes it possible to detect problems in the system in time to address them , and reduces the performance impact of the measures to protect against malicious peers .",
    "p2p applications with a high rate of change in untrustworthy environments are unlikely to succeed .",
    "the rate of change in the system remains important even for applications in which peers may trust each other to cooperate .",
    "if the rate of change is low , then both non - critical applications ( such as off - line network studies , usenet , and content distribution ) and critical applications ( such as ad hoc wireless network deployment for disaster recovery and flash crowd mitigation ) may succeed .",
    "if the system moves quickly , we believe that it is easier to deploy non - critical applications such as song file sharing .",
    "when the problem involves critical information that also changes quickly ( as in the case of internet routing and on - line network monitoring ) , the designer should consider whether the application benefits sufficiently from other features . to the degree that internet routing is successful",
    ", it is because it is amenable to trading accuracy for scalability through techniques such as aggregation of data .",
    "if network monitoring succeeds , it will be because the natural distribution and high volume of the data allow few other appropriate solution architectures beyond p2p .",
    "to summarize , the characteristics that motivate a p2p solution are limited budget , high relevance of the resource , high trust between nodes , a low rate of change in the system , and a low criticality of the solution .",
    "we believe that the limited budget requirement is the most important motivator .",
    "relevance is also very important but can be compensated for by `` saving graces '' such as assumed trust between nodes or strong imposed incentives . lacking these",
    ", we believe that applications of low relevance are not appropriate for p2p solutions .",
    "trust between nodes greatly eases p2p deployment , however there are some applications , such as lockss , freenet and distributed time stamping , where deployment across trust domains is an inherent requirement",
    ". these applications must pay the overhead of distrust between nodes , but are feasible in a p2p context because a low rate of change makes these costs manageable .",
    "while p2p solutions offer many advantages , they are inherently complex to get right and should not be applied blindly to all problems . in providing a framework in which to analyze the characteristics of a problem",
    ", we hope to offer designers with some guidance as to whether their problem warrants a p2p solution .",
