    "theoretical interest in the rare decay @xmath5 as a test of the standard model has been renewed by the experimental results of the cleo collaboration  @xcite . for the first time , this mode has been positively identified and a preliminary determination of its branching ratio given .",
    "the radiative decays of the @xmath11 meson are remarkable for several reasons .",
    "the decay @xmath5 arises from the flavour - changing quark - level process @xmath12 , which occurs through penguin diagrams at one - loop in the standard model . as a result ,",
    "the decay is a purely quantum effect and a subtle test of the standard model .",
    "the process is also sensitive to new physics appearing through virtual particles in the internal loops .",
    "existing bounds on the @xmath12 branching ratio have been used to place constraints on supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite and other extensions of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of these results can be found in  @xcite . finally , it is also remarkable that this rare process has a sufficiently large branching ratio to be detected experimentally .",
    "thus , _ accurate _ experimental measurements and _ accurate _ theoretical calculations of these decays could soon probe new physics at comparatively low energies .    in order to compare the experimental branching ratio with a theoretical prediction it is necessary to know the relevant hadronic matrix elements .",
    "these have been estimated using a wide range of methods , including relativistic and nonrelativistic quark models  @xcite , two - point and three - point qcd sum rules  @xcite and heavy quark symmetry  @xcite , but there remains some disagreement between the different results .",
    "it is therefore of interest to perform a direct calculation of the matrix elements using lattice qcd .",
    "the viability of the lattice approach was first demonstrated by the work of bernard , hsieh and soni  @xcite in 1991 .",
    "excluding qcd contributions , the free quark decay @xmath12 in the sm proceeds by diagrams similar to that shown in  fig.([figure : bsgwloop ] ) .",
    "the charm and top quark dominate , because the up quark contribution to the loop is suppressed by the small ckm factor  @xmath13 .",
    "if the value of the top mass is assumed , the standard model can be tested by deriving an independent result for @xmath14 .",
    "deviations from the expected branching ratio would be an indication of contributions to the decay from physics beyond the sm , to which this decay is potentially sensitive .",
    "research on such contributions can be classified into supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric extensions of the sm . in the latter case ,",
    "cho and misiak  @xcite considered @xmath15 left - right symmetric models and found considerable variations from the sm result for a wide range of the free parameters , while randall and sundrum  @xcite found significant potential deviations from the sm in technicolour models .",
    "anomalous @xmath16 couplings in @xmath12 have been analysed and the results found to be consistent with the sm .",
    "the bounds obtained from this approach can improve on those from direct searches  @xcite .",
    "the contributions from two higgs doublet models  @xcite have been analysed to obtain bounds on the charged higgs mass and @xmath17 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the doublets  @xcite .",
    "susy models also involve additional higgs doublets , but the contribution of other boson - fermion loops , in particular charginos ( @xmath18 ) with up type squarks , and gluinos ( @xmath19 ) or neutralinos ( @xmath20 ) with down type squarks must also be included  @xcite",
    ". a thorough study of the decay in the minimal supersymmetric standard model can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "there are a strong contributions from chargino and gluino loops , especially for large @xmath17 , which interfere destructively with the higgs contribution and allow susy to mimic the sm in some regions of parameter space . as a result ,",
    "the current limits on @xmath17 and higgs masses are weak , but will tighten as more stringent bounds on superpartner masses are obtained .    for the rest of this paper , we shall use the sm as the appropriate model , and look for possible deviations from the experimental branching ratio . it should be noted that the lattice calculation is needed only to determine the effects of low energy qcd , and these are independent of new physics .",
    "the low energy effect of many extensions of the sm will be completely contained within the renormalisation group operator coefficients , and hence it is straightforward to allow for contributions from different models .",
    "the inclusive decay @xmath21 is predominantly a short distance process and can be treated perturbatively in the spectator approximation .",
    "it is also possible to use heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) to compute the leading @xmath22 corrections  @xcite .",
    "the experimental inclusive branching ratio has been determined at cleo  @xcite , @xmath23 the procedure for obtaining this result has a mild model dependence ( the final result is a function of @xmath24 ) .",
    "in addition , the branching ratios of the exclusive decay modes of @xmath12 can also be experimentally determined , and the present published branching ratio for @xmath5 from the cleo collaboration  @xcite is , @xmath25 the advantage of this measurement is that the experimental number is model independent .",
    "theoretical calculation of the relevant exclusive matrix element requires the determination of long distance qcd contributions which can not be determined perturbatively , but can be computed using lattice qcd .      in order to determine the low energy qcd contributions to this decay",
    ", the high energy degrees of freedom must be integrated out , generating an effective @xmath26 , @xmath27 hamiltonian .",
    "grinstein , springer and wise  @xcite determined the hamiltonian @xmath28 , to leading order in weak matrix elements , @xmath29 where the eight operators @xmath30 are multiplied by the renormalisation group coefficients , @xmath31 .",

    "the coefficient @xmath34 is determined using the renormalization group to run down to the appropriate physical scale @xmath35  @xcite , and is approximately given by , @xmath36 where , in the standard model @xcite , @xmath37 the effects of scale uncertainty in the leading order approximation have been considered by buras _",

    "the on - shell matrix for @xmath5 is given by , @xmath38 where , @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the polarization and momentum of the emitted photon .",
    "as outlined by bernard , hsieh and soni  @xcite , the matrix element @xmath42 can be parametrised by three form factors , @xmath43 where , @xmath44 as the photon emitted is on - shell , the form factors need to be evaluated at @xmath45 . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath46 and the coefficient of @xmath47 is zero .",
    "hence , the branching ratio can be expressed in terms of a single form factor , for example , @xmath48 . we shall outline how matrix elements of the form",
    "@xmath49 is a strange - light vector meson , can be calculated in lattice qcd and explain the computational details involved .",
    "we shall evaluate the form factors @xmath4 and @xmath50 , make some statements about the systematic error , and compare the calculated value of @xmath51 with the results from cleo .",
    "we can not directly simulate @xmath52-quarks on the lattice , as will be explained below .",
    "instead , we calculate with a selection of quark masses near the charm mass .",
    "this means that any results for the form factors must be extrapolated to the @xmath52-quark scale .",
    "heavy quark symmetry  @xcite tells us that , @xmath53 as the heavy quark mass , and hence the pseudoscalar meson mass , @xmath54 , grows infinitely large .",
    "combining this with the relation @xmath55 constrains the @xmath7 dependence of the form factors .",
    "pole dominance ideas suggest that , @xmath56 for @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a mass that is equal to @xmath54 plus @xmath59 corrections and @xmath60 is a power . since @xmath61 for large @xmath54",
    ", the combination of heavy quark symmetry and the form factor relation at @xmath62 implies that @xmath63 .",
    "thus we could fit @xmath64 to a constant and @xmath65 to a single pole form or fit @xmath64 to a single pole and @xmath65 to a double pole .",
    "these two cases correspond to , @xmath66 as we will see , our data for @xmath64 appear roughly constant in @xmath7 when @xmath54 is around the charm scale , but have increasing dependence on @xmath7 as the heavy quark mass increases .",

    "the decays @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 have been calculated in the quenched approximation  @xcite and have been found to be in relatively good agreement with experiment .",
    "it is therefore quite plausible to assume that the systematic error from the quenched approximation for this calculation would be of a similar size .",

    "whether pole dominance is a valid model for a large range of @xmath7 is an important question .",
    "we have quoted results for two different possibilities for the @xmath7 dependence of the form factors .",
    "although the lattice results visually favour @xmath146 constant in @xmath7 , at least for heavy quark masses around the charm mass , our fits favour a single pole vector dominance form for @xmath146 .",
    "the difference between the results indicates the need for a better understanding of the combined @xmath7 and heavy quark scaling behaviour of the relevant form factors .    we have not applied the constraint @xmath278 to our fits in this paper , using instead the consistency of our results with this relation as a guide to the fitting method .",
    "we find that the the single pole dominance model for the @xmath7 behaviour of @xmath146 ( and corresponding dipole behaviour for @xmath149 ) gives the most consistent fit . in this case",
    "we have attempted to determine the systematic consistency by comparing @xmath142 , extracted using the @xmath227 scaling law , with @xmath279 assuming pole model behaviour for @xmath146 and the expected pole mass . it could be argued that both methods are equivalent .",
    "however , in extrapolating the form factor @xmath144 to @xmath210 , the coefficients in the fit are not fixed , which is equivalent to letting the pole mass vary .",
