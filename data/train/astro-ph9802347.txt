    "the bright radio source pks  1830211 ( jauncey et al .",
    "1991 ) has attracted much attention as the most detailed example of a lensed radio ring . of the classically - lensed qsos ,",
    "its short time delay of 44 days ( van ommen et al . 1995 ) and clean lens geometry ( e.g. subrahmanyan et al , 1990 ; hereafter s90 ) , make it a good candidate for measuring h@xmath2 . the lens , a gas rich galaxy at z=0.89 , was discovered in the millimeter via molecular absorption ( wiklind & combes 1996 ) , which is seen towards only one of the two flat spectrum hot spots ( wiklind & combes 1996 , frye et al .",
    "1997 ) . a nearby saturated m - star and heavy extinction along the line of sight ( b=-5.7 degrees , djorgovski , et al . 1992 ; hereafter d92 ) has obscured the lens and the source from identification . in this paper",
    "we describe how the mcs deconvolution algorithm ( magain , courbin & sohy , 1997 ) was used to detect the counterparts of this bright radio ring lens in deep keck optical and infrared images .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 band keck data were obtained for this study .",
    "the details of the observations and reductions are presented in courbin , et al .",
    "the mcs deconvolution code ( magain , courbin & sohy , 1997 ) was applied to both the optical and ir images .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of the images ( 3@xmath5 integrated over the whole object ) are 24.0 in @xmath3 and 21.3 in @xmath4 .",
    "the deconvolution process is described in detail by courbin , lidman & magain ( 1997 ) and was applied to the present data in an identical manner .",
    "as output from the procedure , one gets a deconvolved image , decomposed into point sources and a diffuse background , which is compatible with all the input images included in the data set .",
    "the photometry and the astrometry of the point sources are also obtained as byproducts of the deconvolution ( see tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "objects near the frame edges are not well - fitted .",
    "( e.g. objects labelled 2,3 and 4 in figure 1 ) .",
    "note that object 1 is never well - fit by a point source and leaves significant residuals after deconvolution .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is extended or that it is a very strong blend of point sources .",

    "1 we present both the raw and deconvolved images in @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in addition eso @xmath20 and @xmath21 data were taken and are presented in courbin , et al .",
    "the deconvolved images clearly show one red point source at the position expected for the ne radio source of pks  1830211 .",
    "another red object is observed close to the position of the sw radio source of the lensed system , but the extended nature of the source and the poor quality of the psf do not allow us to sort out its morphology .",
    "the photometry and astrometry of the field are presented in tables 1 and 2 and fig .",
    "the point source at the position of the ne radio source is likely to be the ir counterpart of the ne radio image of pks  1830211 . with our high signal - to - noise",
    "we can show that its shape is compatible with a point source , and its color , @xmath22 , is much redder than any `` normal '' star ( e.g. koornneef , 1983 ) .",
    "the i - band position is also within the 1@xmath23 radio error bars . in fig .",
    "2 we align all positions with respect to the m - star so that we can compare the different positions measured for the ne and sw components at optical and ir wavelengths .",
    "we spatially - resolved molecular absorption towards the two lensed images in the mm and measured the lensed source separation to be 098 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in our optical and ir images",
    "the sw component is @xmath24  and @xmath25  away from the ne component respectively .",
    "a plausible explanation for the apparent positional shift between the optical , ir and radio positions is that the sw component is a blend of two objects : the lensing galaxy and the heavily reddened sw component seen in the radio images .",
    "the flux ratio between the two lensed images of the source is 1 in the @xmath3 band and @xmath26 20 in @xmath4 .",
    "the combination of a reddened sw radio source plus blue lens can explain the large flux ratios .",
    "both ne and sw components are reddened , making pks  1830211 another good example of a dusty lens , along with mg  0414 + 0534 ( e.g. annis & lupino , 1993 ) and mg1131 + 0456 ( larkin et al .",
    "1994 ) , the mean galactic extinction being far below the values considered for pks  1830211 .",
    "the main result of our study is the detection of the optical and near - ir counterpart to the ne radio source of pks  1830 - 211 and the possible detection of the sw component and lensing galaxy .",
    "however , our sw component candidate might be the lensing galaxy alone ( its position is also in good agreement with the predictions from the models calculated by s90 and nair , narasimha & rao , 1993 ) or , given the crowding in the field , a red galactic object almost coincident with the position of the sw radio source .",
    "the hypothesis of a demagnified third image of the source ( s90 ) between the 2 main lensed images is unlikely as in such a case extinction of the lens would have made it visible in the ir .",
    "furthermore , the ir centroid of the sw component would have been shifted towards `` object e '' rather than to the radio position of the sw component .    the higher contrast between the ne component and nearby m - star in the infrared make near - ir spectroscopy necessary for finding the source z. deep , high resolution near - ir imaging is needed to reveal the exact nature of the faint sw component . however , even at the highest resolution attainable , 02- 03 in the ir with hst ( in particular in k where the sw component of pks1830 - 211 is best visible ) , deconvolution will be essential to discriminate between the sw component candidate , the lensing galaxy and additional faint galactic stars .",

    "contour levels are spaced by 0.1 jy / beam with the lowest value at 0.1 jy / beam .",
    "the synthesized beamwidth is 068 @xmath28 045 ( lower left ) , where the asymmetry is due to the low elevation of the source as seen from the northern latitude of bima .",
    "the spectral range covers the redshifted @xmath29(2 - 1 ) and @xmath30(2 - 1 ) molecular transitions at 5 km / s resolution , which are shown ( inset ) for both images .",
    "the molecular absorption is detected only in the sw component and does not reach the base of the continuum . since the two images are similarly bright , the lack of absorption in the ne spectrum confirms that the spill over between the two images is negligible ."
