    "this was to be expected : can one still extract from some interesting information ?",
    "the answer is positive , as shown by k. alexander in @xcite .",
    "the crucial point is not to take the limit in @xmath14 , but rather exploit up to the scale of the correlation length of the annealed system , which is just a homogeneous system with pinning potential @xmath343 ( see remark  [ rem : corr ] ) .",

    "note that , as pointed out in remark  [ rem : corr ] , on such a scale the annealed partition function starts exhibiting exponential growth and one feels the size of the free energy ( we will actually need to choose the size of the system , call it @xmath384 , to be a large , but finite , multiple of the correlation length , the relative error @xmath385 in leaves the room to make such an estimate ) .",
    "once such an estimate on a system of length @xmath384 is achieved , it is a matter of chopping the polymer into @xmath386 portions : some work at the boundary of these regions is needed and for that we refer to @xcite , while we focus on explaining why the second moment method works up to the correlation length scale .",
    "let us therefore go back to and let us set @xmath387 ( and assume that it is an integer number ) .",
    "with such a choice , by exploiting the estimates outlined in remark  [ rem : free ] , it is not difficult to see that for every @xmath75 and @xmath388 there exists @xmath389 such that @xmath390 this is because , as long as @xmath391 is finite and @xmath343 tends to zero , the system is in the _ critical window _ ( as a matter of fact , in @xcite the limit of @xmath392 as @xmath343 tends to zero , @xmath391 kept fixed , is computed and the notion of critical window is further elaborated ) .",

    "since @xmath408 is bounded below by @xmath409 ( see ) we see that on the scale of correlation length the quenched partition function grows ( almost ) like the annealed one with large probability if @xmath6 is small enough .",
    "the technique for lower bounds on the free energy that we have outlined , as well as the technique in @xcite , lead to upper bounds on @xmath252 also in the case @xmath410 , see and remark  [ rem:1/2 ] . but a look at theorem  [ th : main>1/2](2 ) suffices to see that the case @xmath411 is somewhat different , because it is no longer true that @xmath412 .",

    "a necessary condition , that with some careful work one can show also to be sufficient , is that the expectation of the term in the exponent in the exponent is small , namely that ( _ cf .",

    "we see that we are asking @xmath419 to be small .",
    "therefore in this regime we expect the second moment method to work , leading to localization and also to the fact that the quenched free energy is fairly close to the annealed one , if @xmath420 with @xmath421 a small ( fixed ) constant .",
