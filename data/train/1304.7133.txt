    "measurement of the moments of distribution for conserved quantities like net - baryon , net - charge and net - strangeness number for systems undergoing strong interactions as in high energy heavy - ion collisions , have recently provided rich physics insights  @xcite .",
    "the most crucial realization is that , the product of moments of the conserved number distributions are measurable experimentally and can be linked to susceptibilities ( @xmath2 ) computed in quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) based calculations  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath3@xmath4 = @xmath5 and @xmath6@xmath7 = @xmath8 , where @xmath4 is the standard deviation , @xmath3 is the skewness , @xmath6 is the kurtosis of the measured conserved number distribution , @xmath9 are the @xmath10 order theoretically calculated susceptibilities associated with these conserved numbers .",
    "such a connection between theory and high energy heavy - ion collision experiment has led to furthering our understanding about the freeze - out conditions  @xcite , details of the quark - hadron transition  @xcite and plays a crucial role for the search of possible qcd critical point in the qcd phase diagram  @xcite . in all such physics cases",
    "there is a need to establish a reference point for the measurements .",
    "computing these quantities within the framework of a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model  @xcite provides such a reference for both experimental data and qcd based calculations .",
    "the experimental measurements have limitations , they are usually available for a fraction of the total kinematic phase space , due to the finite detector geometries and can detect only certain species of the produced particles . for example , measurements related to net - baryon number distribution is restricted by the kinematic range in @xmath1 where their identification is possible .",
    "in addition , baryons like neutron are not commonly measured in most of the high energy heavy - ion collision experiments . while for the net - charge number distribution , the limitation is usually in kinematic range available in @xmath0 and the details of how contribution from different charge states and resonances are dealt with in the measurements .",
    "the kinematic acceptance in a typical high energy heavy - ion collision experiment like star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite at the relativistic heavy - ion collider facility ( rhic ) for net - charge multiplicity distributions are : @xmath11 @xmath12 0.5 , 0.2 @xmath12 @xmath1 @xmath12 2.0 gev/@xmath13 and @xmath11 @xmath12 0.35 , 0.3 @xmath12 @xmath1 @xmath12 1.0 gev/@xmath13 , respectively . while for net - baryon number and net - strangeness related studies carried out in the star experiment , within @xmath11 @xmath12 0.5 , is through the measurement of net - protons and net - kaons in the range of 0.4 @xmath12 @xmath1 @xmath12 0.8 gev/@xmath13 and 0.2 @xmath12 @xmath1 @xmath12 2.0 gev/@xmath13 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate using the hrg model ( discussed in next section ) , the effect of the above experimental limitations on the physics observables @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "our model based study clearly shows that the value of the observables related to net - charge and net - strangeness strongly depends on the experimental kinematic and charge state acceptances . where charge state could be electric charge ( @xmath14 ) = 1 or higher for net - charge measurements and strangeness number ( @xmath15 ) = 1 or higher for net - strangeness measurements .",
    "in contrast , the net - baryon number studies are found to be minimally affected by these experimental limitations . in this work ,",
    "we have not considered the initial baryon distribution due to the participant number fluctuations in the heavy - ion collisions on the results for net - baryon fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "another important effect that could influence the values of the higher moments of the net - charge , net - strangeness and net - baryon number distributions in limited acceptance , are the conservation laws related to charge , strangeness and baryon number .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section  [ sec : hrg ]",
    ", we will discuss the hrg model used in this study .",
    "in the section  [ sec : results ] , the results for the observable @xmath5 and @xmath8 are presented for different kinematic acceptances , charge states , effect of collective flow of particle in the system and the resonance decay contributions .",
    "we also provide a table listing the values of these observable for typical experimental conditions as encountered in star and phenix experiments at rhic and alice experiment at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) facility . finally in section  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our findings and mention about the implications of this work to the current experimental measurements in high energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in the hrg model , we include all the relevant degrees of freedom of the confined , strongly interacting matter and also implicitly take into account the interactions that result in resonance formation  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the fireball created in heavy ion collision does not remain static , rather expands both in longitudinal and transverse directions until freeze out occurs . however , to keep the model simple , we first consider a static homogeneous fireball and flow effects are included subsequently .    in heavy ion collision , no fluctuation would be seen in measurements with full phase space coverage as @xmath16 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are strictly conserved . however , since most of the experiments cover only limited phase space , the part of the fireball accessible to the measurements may resemble with the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) where energy ( momentum ) , charge and number are not conserved locally .",
    "in general , the magnitude of multiplicity fluctuations and correlations in limited phase space crucially depends on the choice of the statistical ensemble that imposes different conservation laws @xcite .",
    "since no extensive quantities like energy , momentum and charge are needed to be locally conserved in gce , the particles following maxwell - boltzmann distribution are assumed to be uncorrelated and fluctuations are expected to follow poisson statistics even in the limited phase space when quantum effects are ignored . in case of particles following bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distributions , within finite phase space , poisson statistics is not expected to be obeyed and hence the deviations from poisson limit can be studied .    in the ambit of gce framework ,",

    "<S> net - baryon , net - charge and net - strangeness number fluctuations in high energy heavy - ion collisions are discussed within the framework of a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model </S>",
    "<S> . ratios of the conserved number susceptibilities calculated in hrg are being compared to the corresponding experimental measurements to extract information about the freeze - out condition and the phase structure of systems with strong interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the importance of considering the actual experimental acceptances in terms of kinematics ( pseudorapidity ( @xmath0 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) ) , the detected charge state , effect of collective motion of particles in the system and the resonance decay contributions before comparisons are made to the theoretical calculations . in this work , based on hrg model </S>",
