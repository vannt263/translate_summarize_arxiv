    "our model is similar to the model in @xcite , and therefore the interaction between the surface and the tilt order is taken into account .",
    "it is very interesting that the idof of molecules interacts with the external degrees of freedom that are the shape of surfaces . in many statistical systems",
    "the external degrees of freedom and the idof are treated independently .",
    "we know that spin models such as @xmath0 model and potts model on fluctuating surfaces were extensively studied @xcite , however , their idof interact only with the intrinsic geometry and hence seems to be independent of the shape of surfaces .",

    "if it were not for the projection of @xmath4 on the triangle @xmath5 , the variable @xmath4 has no connection to the extrinsic geometry of surfaces .",
    "however , the projected variable @xmath6 obviously interacts with the surface , therefore the shape of surface is influenced by correlations between @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , we can also expect that the surface fluctuation nontrivially influences the interaction between @xmath6 .",
    "the so - called kt transition of @xmath0 model on periodic flat surfaces can be changed into some other transitions or can disappear by three - dimensional effects caused by the fluctuation of surfaces or by effects of the surface topology .",

    "however , as we see in fig.[fig-12](a ) , the peak value @xmath127 remains constant even when @xmath47 increases .",
    "this is consistent to the behavior of @xmath126 in fig.[fig-11](a ) .     against @xmath47 at ( a ) @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath84 , and ( c ) @xmath85 .",
    "the straight lines in ( b ) and ( c ) were drawn by fitting the data ( the largest three data in ( c ) ) to the form of eq.([sigma - scale]).,width=472 ]    the peak value @xmath127 of @xmath128 is plotted against @xmath47 in a log - log scale in figs.[fig-13](a)(c ) .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath127 in fig.[fig-13](a ) stops growing with increasing @xmath47 , which is in sharp contrast to the cases in figs.[fig-13](b),(c ) .",
    "the straight lines in figs.[fig-13](b ) and [ fig-13](c ) are drawn by fitting the data to the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a critical exponent of the transition .",
    "the largest three data are used in the fitting in the case of @xmath85 in figs.[fig-13](c ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath132 the first result in eq.([sigma - value ] ) implies that the transition is of second order ( or continuous ) at @xmath84 , because @xmath131 is considered to be @xmath133 . from the finite - size scaling ( fss ) theory , we know that @xmath133 corresponds a continuous transition . on the contrary , the transition appear to be discontinuous at @xmath85 , because the second result in eq.([sigma - value ] ) is considered to be almost equal to @xmath134 .",
    "we expect that the order of transition turns to be discontinuous when @xmath19 is reduced , because a discontinuous transition can be seen in the case of @xmath94 @xcite .     versus @xmath18 at ( a ) @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath84 , and ( c ) @xmath85 .",
    "the expected relation @xmath135 is satisfied .",
    ", width=472 ]    finally , we show @xmath136 versus @xmath18 in figs.[fig-14](a)(c ) .",
    "@xmath136 is expected to be @xmath135 because of the scale invariant property of the partition function .",
    "consequently , we can use this relation to see whether the simulations are performed successfully .",
    "it is easy to see that the relation is satisfied in almost all cases except in the smooth phase at @xmath83 ; however , the deviation is still very small compared to the value @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , we consider that the simulations are performed correctly .",
    "we have investigated an interaction between the tilt order and the shape of surfaces of the conventional surface model of helfrich , polyakov and kleinert by monte carlo simulations on triangulated spherical lattices .",
    "the purpose of this study is to see how the tilt order influences the collapsing transition and the surface fluctuation transition , both of which were reported to be of first - order in the conventional surface model @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model in this paper is defined by a linear combination of the hpk hamiltonian and that of the @xmath0 model .",
    "the unit vector @xmath6 of the @xmath0 model is defined on the triangle @xmath5 by projecting a three - dimensional vector on the triangle , where the three - dimensional vector is assumed to represent a lipid molecule usually called a director .",
    "since the vector @xmath6 is parallel to the triangle @xmath5 , the @xmath0 model is not identical to the naive @xmath0 model defined on the planar lattices .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 , which is the coefficient of the @xmath0 hamiltonian , is assumed to @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 in the simulations . in the case of @xmath83",
    "the vectors @xmath2 are considered to be in a relatively ordered state , while in the cases @xmath84 and @xmath85 they are in disordered states .",
    "we find that the variables @xmath6 change depending only on @xmath19 and are almost independent of whether the surface is smooth or not .",
    "in fact , the internal energy @xmath71 and the magnetization @xmath60 remain almost constant in the range of @xmath18 including @xmath87 the collapsing transition point .",
    "it is also observed that the collapsing transition is not so strongly influenced by the tilt order .",
    "the transition is slightly softened in the presence of tilt order , however , it remains in first - order and occurs almost independent of @xmath19 at least up to @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , the collapsing phase at the transition point is characterized by a physical hausdorff dimension , i.e. , @xmath137 in all cases @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "this result is consistent with the physical hausdorff dimension at @xmath94 reported in @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the transition of surface fluctuations is influenced by the tilt order .",
    "the transition appears to remain discontinuous at @xmath85 , where the variables @xmath6 weakly correlate with each other and are relatively at random .",
    "as the coefficient increases to @xmath84 , the transition is softened and turns to be a continuous one .",
    "moreover , the transition disappears and turns to be a higher - order one as @xmath19 increases to @xmath83 .",
    "this result leads us to conclude that the collapsing transition is not always accompanied by the surface fluctuation transition in the surface model with internal degrees of freedom such as the tilt order .    finally , we comment on whether the phase structure is influenced by the singular points of @xmath2 , which appear even at zero temperature due to the surface topology .",
    "the exponents @xmath101 shown in eq.([mu - scale ] ) and the hausdorff dimension @xmath105 in eq.([h - results ] ) , both of which characterize the collapsing transition , are not influenced by the singular points .",
    "in fact , the collapsing transition is almost independent of the variables @xmath2 as we have shown in this paper .",
    "however , it remains unclarified whether or not the exponent @xmath131 in eq.([sigma - value ] ) is influenced by the singularity ; more precisely , it remains to be studied whether or not the softening of the surface fluctuation transition is caused only by the singularity of @xmath2 or the topology of surface , although kt transition itself is expected to be independent of the surface topology as discussed in section [ xy - model - rigidsphere ] ."
