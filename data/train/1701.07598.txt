    "the superconducting ring has attracted considerable attention in the context of both fundamental superconductor research and application , because of its geometry - related effects , such as fluxoid quantization and quantum interference.@xcite the magnetic flux , or more precisely , magnetic fluxoid , through an ordinary superconducting ring is quantized in units of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is planck s constant and @xmath3 is the electron charge.@xcite in superconducting devices and applications , a superconducting ring with or without josephson junctions has acted as a key element.@xcite understanding its magnetic properties is valuable for the design and analysis of , for example , a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid),@xcite a gravity gradiometry,@xcite an ultracold atom trap,@xcite and a subpiconewton force standard.@xcite in particular , the concept of quantum - based force realization,@xcite which some authors have suggested as a candidate for the subpiconewton force standard previously , utilizes magnetic fluxoid quanta in a microscale superconducting ring . the force can be increased or decreased by a force step , estimated to be on the subpiconewton level , by controlling the fluxoid number .",
    "the magnetic moment due to a single fluxoid quantum is the minimum unit for generating a magnetic force in a well - defined magnetic field gradient .    determining the unit magnetic moment with not only high sensitivity , but also high precision is key towards establishing the suggested method as the first standard for an extremely small force , because the unit magnetic moment defines the magnitude and precision of the unit force to be realized . besides the small - force - standard application,@xcite the unit magnetic moment based on fluxoid quanta can be utilized as a new reference for a small magnetic moment at the femtoampere - square - meter level .",
    "several theoretical methods@xcite have been developed to calculate the magnetic moments as well as the magnetic - field and current - density profiles for various values of the fluxoid number and external magnetic field in superconducting thin - film rings and disks .",
    "initially , cases of negligibly small penetration depth @xmath4 were addressed,@xcite and brandt and clem@xcite generalized the previous studies to finite @xmath4 , providing a calculation method to give precise numerical solutions .",
    "although their theory has been adopted for superconducting ring design or to interpret its properties over the past decade,@xcite very few experimental studies providing high - precision measurements of the ring magnetic moment have been reported.@xcite    experimentally , the measurement sensitivity for microsample magnetic moments is approaching its limit , as a result of the notable recent improvement in the force sensitivity in dynamic cantilever magnetometry@xcite down to attonewton level.@xcite in a study of persistent currents in normal metal rings,@xcite for example , dynamic cantilever magnetometry , which measures the resonance frequency shift of a cantilever in a magnetic field , exhibited a resolution that was approximately 250-fold superior to squid magnetometers@xcite for detection of a ring s current .",
    "this result finally resolved previous order - of - magnitude discrepancies between experimental and theoretical current values .",
    "such high sensitivity is obtained by applying high external fields . as regards dynamic cantilever magnetometry analysis of the low - field magnetic properties of a sample , however , a significant sensitivity reduction is inevitable .",
    "very recently , this limitation was overcome using a phase - locked approach suggested by jang et al.@xcite these researchers succeeded in detecting small half - fluxoid - quantum signals in an sr@xmath5ro@xmath6 superconductor at low static fields by applying an additional oscillating field , which was phase - locked to the cantilever position , for signal enhancement .",
    "the above studies have highlighted the potential sensitivity of dynamic cantilever magnetometry for magnetic - moment detection at both high and low magnetic fields .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt dynamic cantilever magnetometry for precision measurement of the small magnetic moments of fluxoids in a superconducting microring .",
    "however , in order to retain a simple measurement geometry and to reduce the uncertainty factors , we do not employ a phase - locked approach , which requires precise control of the modulation field.@xcite instead , we enhance the resonance frequency shift by increasing the external field after trapping fluxoids in the ring . for a micron - sized nb ring ,",
    "we determine the magnetic moment of a single fluxoid , along with the meissner susceptibility of the ring , and compare the results with theoretical estimations from the brandt and clem method.@xcite for accurate comparison , we prepare a ring sample with a well - defined geometry on an ultrasoft cantilever and utilize a fiber - optic interferometer with subnanometer resolution , with the fiber on a piezo positioner ; this setup enables precision vibration measurement at multiple target positions on the cantilever .",
    "the latter is necessary for the experimental determination of the cantilever vibration mode characteristics , such as its effective length , which is otherwise theoretically estimated .",
    "for the sample - on - cantilever configuration , we batch - fabricate cantilevers with an nb ring sample . after",
    "the cantilever patterns are defined in a low - pressure chemical vapor deposited ( lpcvd ) silicon - nitride layer on a silicon wafer , a 100-nm - thick nb ring with nominal inner and outer radii of @xmath7 = 2 and @xmath8 = 4 @xmath9 m , respectively , is fabricated via lift - off patterning with photolithography .",
    "the ring is aligned with the mounting paddle center of each cantilever , as can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : schem ] ( b , right ) .",
    "the cantilever fabrication is then completed , taking care to protect the attached , high - quality nb film ( see ref .  [ ] for more details ) .",
    "the released cantilevers have 367-@xmath9 m length , 4-@xmath9 m width , and 200-nm thickness , with a mounting paddle at one end .",
    "the lateral dimensions and surface quality of the nb ring are measured and examined using a tescan mira scanning electron microscope ( sem ) .",
    "the sample - on - cantilever device is placed on a piezoactuator in high vacuum , surrounded by a superconducting solenoid for application of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "its low - temperature vibration amplitude and resonance frequency are measured with a low - noise fiber - optic interferometer using a 1550-nm tunable laser ( agilent 81660b-200 ) with a high wavelength stability of 1 pm for 24 h and a coherence control feature , which has been demonstrated to have subpicometer resolution at an optical power of 10 @xmath9w and room temperature.@xcite for our study , a very low laser power of 13 nw at the fiber end is adopted to avoid optical effects such as photothermal actuation .",
    "the fiber , attached to a 3-axis piezo positioner , is located above a target position on the cantilever . the optical interference from the optical - fiber cantilever cavity",
    "is detected at a photodiode coupled to a low - noise transimpedance amplifier ( femtoamp dlpca-200 ) .",
    "the cantilever frequency is primarily measured at a temperature of 4.3 k. in the magnetic - field - cooling ( fc ) process , the cantilever temperature is elevated momentarily using a light - emitting diode to above the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath10 , of the nb ring and then recovered .",
    "the entire system is mounted on a double - stage vibration - isolation platform including a 21-ton mass block .",
    "figure  [ fig : schem ] ( a ) shows the key features of our dynamic cantilever magnetometry setup . in an external magnetic field @xmath11 , the magnetic moment @xmath12 of the sample exerts a torque on the cantilever .",
    "for a two - dimensional sample , we can assume that @xmath12 has an out - of - plane component @xmath13 only .",
    "then , the magnitude of the torque is given as @xmath14 and , with @xmath15 , the relative angle @xmath16 of @xmath12 and @xmath11 is identical to the cantilever surface angle at the sample position with respect to the @xmath17 direction .",
    "the shift of the resonance frequency @xmath18 due to the magnetic torque@xcite is expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the spring constant and intrinsic resonance frequency of the cantilever , respectively , and @xmath22 is the cantilever effective length . in the case of our superconducting ring , @xmath13 has two contributions , from the diamagnetic response due to the meissner current and from the @xmath23 magnetic fluxoids in the ring hole . here",

    "the theoretical value of @xmath27 for a rectangular euler - bernoulli beam of length @xmath28 is frequently used.@xcite however , the @xmath22 of our device was experimentally determined to be @xmath29 or 248 @xmath9 m , by measuring the shape of the first vibration mode with a fiber on the piezo positioner .",
    "the minimum detectable frequency shift and magnetic moment , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , of our cantilever were estimated to be 1.1 mhz and 1.2 fam@xmath32 , respectively , for a 1-hz detection bandwidth with @xmath33 = 40 oe .",
    "the characterization of the cantilever mechanical properties is described in more detail in appendix a.",
    "to observe the superconducting transition , the @xmath18 of the cantilever was monitored with increasing temperature in a magnetic field of 10 oe , applied perpendicularly to the mounted nb ring after zero - field cooling to @xmath34 4.5 k. the @xmath18 temperature dependence exhibits a typical feature of a diamagnetic superconducting transition , with an onset temperature of @xmath35 8.3 k , with the exception that a slope is apparent across the entire displayed temperature range ( fig .

    "[ fig : fvst ] , having a slope of -5.5 mhz / k ; this slope is obtained from a fit of the data in the normal state .",
    "the possible origins of the negative slope are the temperature dependence of the cantilever dimensions , cantilever surface stress , and so on ; further discussion of this topic is presented in appendix b.        in the meissner state of the nb ring , the @xmath18 response to sweeping @xmath33 follows eq .",

    "[ fig : hdep ] ( a ) .",
    "the parabolic dependence is valid in the @xmath38 60 oe range , whereas it breaks down beyond this range as a result of magnetic vortex penetration into the annular area , i.e. , a mixed state of nb .",
    "such a small critical field value is attributed to the high demagnetization effect due to the quasi-2d sample geometry.@xcite as we increase the fc magnetic field , @xmath39 , used in cooling the nb ring from above @xmath10 , more magnetic fluxoids are contained within the ring hole .",

    "the error bars indicate standard deviations , and the dashed lines are guides for the eye . ]    to observe individual magnetic fluxoids at @xmath34 4.3 k , we varied @xmath39 from 10 to 13 oe with a smaller step of 0.1 oe . to enhance the @xmath44 signal for @xmath40 for low @xmath39",
    ", we increased the magnetic field from @xmath39 to a larger and fixed value , i.e.,@xmath33 = 40 oe , before measuring @xmath18 .",
    "this procedure is depicted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fstep ] . in this manner , we could obtain @xmath40 for small @xmath23 , because @xmath40 is independent of the magnetic field , but its contribution to @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath33 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "note that the contributions of @xmath45 for various @xmath39 are identical and can be universally eliminated because @xmath33 is fixed .",
    "figure  [ fig : fstep ] clearly shows that @xmath18 has a stepwise feature with varying @xmath39 .",
