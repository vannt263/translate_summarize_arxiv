    "the one - dimensional @xmath0-extended supersymmetric quantum mechanics is an important and active research subject in many areas of both mathematics and physics .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for more comprehensive recent reviews of some of its aspects which , due to space - time limitations , can not be covered in the present talk . here",
    "we will focus on two main topics . at first",
    ", we make a review of the current status of the classification of the irreducible linear representations of the algebra associated with the one - dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics . in the following",
    "it will be presented a graphical interpretation of the @xmath1 fusion algebra introduced in @xcite .    concerning the classification of the irreps , the basic references are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was proven , essentially , that the irreps fall into classes of equivalence characterized by an associated clifford algebra irrep ( the connection between clifford algebras and extended supersymmetries of @xmath1 quantum mechanics was previously shown in ) . in @xcite",
    "this result was used as the starting point to produce a classification of the irreps . in this work a presentation of the results of @xcite will be made .",
    "some issues raised in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) will be answered , proving the compatibility of their results with the @xcite classification .",
    "it seems appropriate to present this seminar in a symposium in honour of jerzy lukierski .",
    "even if our collaboration did not involve the topics here discussed , the results here presented , however , were made possible by applying a formalism first elaborated in our common works ( especially @xcite ) .",
    "the finite linear irreps of the @xmath3 @xmath0-extended supersymmetry algebra @xmath4 ( where the @xmath5 s , @xmath6 , are the supersymmetry generators and @xmath7 is the hamiltonian ) are expressed by the set of @xmath8 symbols representing the field - contents of the irreps .",
    "the non - negative integers @xmath9 s specify the number of fields of dimension @xmath10 entering an irrep ( the constant @xmath11 can be arbitrarily chosen ) .",
    "the fields whose dimension differs by @xmath12 have opposite statistics ( bosonic / fermionic ) .",
    "the number @xmath13 specifies the number of different dimensions of the fields entering an irrep and is referred to as the  length \" of the irrep ; @xmath13 must satisfy the condition @xmath14 , with the @xmath15 irreps being known in the literature as the  minimal - length \" or ",
    "root \" multiplets . in @xcite",
    "it was explicily presented the complete list of the allowed @xmath8 field contents for @xmath16 .",
    "an algorithmic construction for computing the field contents for arbitrarily large values of @xmath0 was produced and selected @xmath17 examples were given .",
    "the list in @xcite is understood as follows : for any @xmath0 , @xmath8 is present if and only if there exists at least one @xmath0-irrep with the given field content . as an example , the length-@xmath18 @xmath19 field content is present for @xmath20 , but not for @xmath21 , meaning that there are no irrep with the given field content for @xmath21 , but there is ( at least one ) such irrep for @xmath20 .",
    "the construction of @xcite heavily relied on the @xcite results which we briefly summarize here .",
    "all @xmath0-irreps of length @xmath22 are obtained from the set of @xmath23 operators acting on root multiplets after applying an _ acceptable _ dressing transformation @xmath24 .",
    "the dressing operator @xmath25 is a diagonal operator whose entries are either @xmath26 or positive powers of @xmath7 .  acceptable \" refers to the fact that the whole set of @xmath27 transformed operators must be regular ( that is , as matrix operators , they must not contain any entry with @xmath28 or higher poles ) .",
    "two distinct acceptable operators @xmath29 , @xmath30 leading to the same field content applied on the same set of @xmath23 root multiplets operators are given by a permutation of their diagonal entries .",
    "@xmath31 are obviously related by a similarity transformation , @xmath32 ( it is worth recalling that the exchange of the diagonal elements in , e.g. , a @xmath33 diagonal matrix @xmath25 is recovered in terms of the @xmath33 similarity matrix @xmath340@xmath351@xmath361@xmath350@xmath37 ) .",
    "similarity transformations between two acceptable dressings of given field - content and for a fixed set of @xmath23 operators acting on root multiplets form a group of transformations which corresponds to a subgroup @xmath38 of the permutation group of the diagonal elements of the dressing transformations .    concerning the length-@xmath39 root multiplets the situation is the following .",
    "they are recovered by an associated clifford irrep of weyl type ( i.e. , whose generators are in block antidiagonal form ) through the following position @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are matrices entering the associated clifford generators @xmath43 the @xmath0 clifford generators entering ( [ weylclifford ] ) are recovered from the block - antidiagonal space - like generators of the @xmath44 clifford algebras ( with @xmath45 signature ) according to the following scheme : @xmath46 the maximal value for @xmath0 corresponds to @xmath47 ( the  oxidized \" cases @xcite ) .",
    "the reduced supersymmetries ( for @xmath48 ) are obtained by selecting a proper subset of the block antidiagonal @xmath44 space - like generators .",
    "notice that , unlike the other values of @xmath0 , the @xmath49 mod @xmath50 cases can be recovered in two different ways .    for a fixed value of @xmath0 , the @xmath0 clifford generators entering ( [ weylclifford ] ) can be uniquely chosen up to similarity transformations ( this result is in consequence of the unicity of the real irreducible clifford algebra representations for @xmath51 mod @xmath50 ) .",
    "this important property applies in particular to the reduced values of @xmath0 , implying that two different choices of the @xmath48 proper subset of block antidiagonal space - like generators are equivalent .",
    "it also implies that the two ways in ( [ oxidation1 ] ) of recovering the @xmath49 mod @xmath50 supersymmetries are equivalent , producing root multiplets which are related by similarity transformations . for any given @xmath0",
    "the ( [ weylclifford ] ) clifford generators associated to supersymmetric root multiplets can be canonically chosen .",
    "they can be presented as matrices whose non - vanishing entries are @xmath52 .",
    "a group @xmath53 of similarity transformations relates all choices of clifford generators whose non - vanishing entries are @xmath52 .",
    "the dressing transformations , applied to each set of clifford generators of this type , produce irreps with the same field - contents .",
    "taking into account these properties , the @xcite classification of the field - contents produces a classification of the linear finite irreps of the @xmath3 @xmath0-extended supersymmetry .",
    "the @xmath54 symbol uniquely characterizes the irreps upon which the @xmath55 supersymmetry operators act .",
    "the @xmath23 operators acting on root multiplets are related by the group @xmath53 of similarity transformations , while the acceptable dressing operators @xmath25 are related by the group @xmath38 of similarity transformations . under this equivalence class of transformations",
    ", @xmath56 uniquely specifies an irrep .",
    "the complete list of @xmath54 irreps for @xmath57 is furnished in @xcite and will not be reproduced here .",
    "the notion of fusion algebra of the supersymmetric vacua of the @xmath0-extended one dimensional supersymmetry was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the tensoring of two zero - energy vacuum - state irreps ( irreps associated with the zero energy eigenvalue of the hamiltonian operator @xmath7 ) can be symbolically written as @xmath58\\times [ j ] & = & { n_{ij}}^k [ k]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 are non - negative integers specifying the decomposition of the tensored - products irreps into its irreducible constituents .",
    "the @xmath59 integers satisfy a fusion algebra with the following properties    @xmath26 ) constraint on the total number of component fields , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of bosonic ( fermionic ) fields in the given irreps .",
    "@xmath39 ) the symmetry property @xmath62    @xmath63 ) the associativity condition , @xmath64\\times ( [ j]\\times[k ] ) & = & ( [ i]\\times[j])\\times[k]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies the commutativity of the @xmath65 fusion matrices .",
    "fusion algebras can also be nicely presented in terms of their associated graphs .",
    "the @xmath66 and @xmath2 fusion graphs are produced in the appendix ( with two subcases for each @xmath0 , according to whether or not the irreps are distinguished w.r.t .",
    "their bosonic / fermionic statistics ) .",
    "let us discuss here how to present the @xcite results in graphical form .",
    "the irreps correspond to points .",
    "@xmath67 oriented lines ( with arrows ) connect the @xmath68 $ ] and the @xmath69 $ ] irrep if the decomposition ( [ fusion ] ) holds .",
    "the arrows are dropped from the lines if the @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 $ ] irreps can be interchanged . the @xmath70 $ ]",
    "irrep should correspond to a generator of the fusion algebra .",
    "this means that the whole set of @xmath71 fusion matrices is produced as sum of powers of the @xmath72 fusion matrix .",
    "let us discuss explicitly the @xmath2 case .",
    "we obtain the following list of four irreps ( if we discriminate their statistics ) : @xmath73\\equiv ( 2,2)_{bos};~ \\relax [ 2]\\equiv ( 1,2,1)_{bos } ; ~ \\relax[3]\\equiv ( 2,2)_{fer};~ \\relax [ 4]\\equiv ( 1,2,1)_{fer}&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding @xmath2 fusion algebra is realized in terms of four @xmath74 , mutually commuting , matrices given by the fusion algebra admits three distinct elements , @xmath75 and one generator ( we can choose either @xmath76 or @xmath77 ) , due to the relations @xmath78 the vector space spanned by @xmath75 is closed under multiplication @xmath79 this fusion algebra corresponds to the  smiling face \" graph ( figure @xmath18 in the appendix ) .",
    "the supersymmetric quantum mechanism is a fascinating subject with several open problems .",
    "the potentially most interesting one concerns perhaps the construction of off - shell invariant actions with the dimension of a kinetic term for large values of @xmath0 ( let s say @xmath80 ) . they could provide some hints towards an off - shell formulation of higher - dimensional supergravity and @xmath81-theory .",
    "the fusion algebras , which encode the information of the decomposition of tensor representations , could provide useful in attacking this problem .    concerning the representation theory itself ,",
    "some questions are still opened .",
    "the authors of @xcite pointed out the existence of inequivalent ( starting from @xmath82 ) supersymmetry irreps with the same field content .",
    "they explicitly discussed the @xmath83 @xmath84 and the @xmath85 @xmath84 irreps , producing in both cases two inequivalent irreps .",
    "these results are in agreement with those in @xcite . at first",
    "it must be noticed that @xmath84 is an admissible field content for both @xmath83 and @xmath85 irreps , see @xcite .",
    "the inequivalences obtained in @xcite correspond to a different notion of the equivalence relation than the one here discussed ( their equivalence class is w.r.t . the general linear transformations of the supersymmetry generators and/or fields ) .",
    "it produces a refinement of the equivalence relation here employed . to spot the differences",
    ", one can use the valid analogy of the classification of simple lie algebras .",
    "simple lie algebras over the complex numbers are classified by the dynkin s diagrams , while simple lie algebras over the reals are obtained by the real forms .",
    "the @xmath54 field contents work as dynkin s diagrams , uniquely specifying the irreps under the class of equivalence here discussed .    concerning the classification of irreps",
    ", the present status is the following .",
    "the complete classification of the irreps under the equivalence relation here discussed was produced in @xcite ( explicit results were furnished for @xmath57 ) . at present",
    ", no classification of irreps is yet available under the @xcite notion of the equivalence relation .",
    "+   +   +   we present here four fusion graphs of the @xmath66 and @xmath2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics irreps .",
    "the  @xmath86 \" cases below correspond to ignore the statistics ( bosonic / fermionic ) of the given irreps . in the  @xmath87 \" cases , the number of fundamental irreps is doubled w.r.t . the previous ones , in order to take the statistics of the irreps into account .",
