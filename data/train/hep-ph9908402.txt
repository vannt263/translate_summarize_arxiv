    "one of the common goals in the forthcoming experiments is the search for new phenomena . in the forthcoming high energy physics experiments ( lhc , tev22 , nlc , ... )",
    "the main goal is the search for physics beyond the standard model ( supersymmetry , @xmath10- , @xmath11-bosons , ... ) and the higgs boson discovery as a final confirmation of the standard model . in estimation of the discovery potential of the future experiments ( to be specific in this paper we shall use as an example cms experiment at lhc  @xcite ) the background cross section is calculated and for the given integrated luminosity @xmath12",
    "the average number of background events is @xmath13 .",
    "suppose the existence of a new physics leads to the nonzero signal cross section @xmath14 with the same signature as for the background cross section that results in the prediction of the additional average number of signal events @xmath15 for the integrated luminosity @xmath12 .",
    "the total average number of the events is @xmath16 .",
    "so , as a result of new physics existence , we expect an excess of the average number of events . in real experiments",
    "the probability of the realization of @xmath17 events is described by poisson distribution  @xcite    @xmath18    here @xmath19 is the average number of events .",
    "remember that the poisson distribution @xmath20 gives  @xcite the probability of finding exactly @xmath17 events in the given interval of ( e.g. space and time ) when the events occur independently of one another at an average rate of @xmath19 per the given interval .",
    "for the poisson distribution the variance @xmath21 equals to @xmath19 .",
    "so , to estimate the probability of the new physics discovery we have to compare the poisson statistics with @xmath22 and @xmath23 . usually , high energy physicists use the following `` significances '' for testing the possibility to discover new physics in an experiment :    * `` significance '' @xmath3  @xcite , * `` significance '' @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "a conventional claim is that for @xmath24 we shall discover new physics ( here , of course , the systematical errors are ignored ) . for @xmath25",
    "the significances @xmath26 and @xmath27 coincide ( the search for higgs boson through the @xmath28 signature ) . for the case when @xmath29 ,  @xmath26 and @xmath27 differ .",
    "therefore , a natural question arises : what is the correct definition for the significance @xmath26 , @xmath27 or anything else ?",
    "it should be noted that there is a crucial difference between `` future '' experiment and the `` real '' experiment . in the `` real '' experiment",
    "the total number of events @xmath30 is a given number ( already has been measured ) and we compare it with @xmath0 when we test the validity of the standard physics .",
    "so , the number of possible signal events is determined as @xmath31 and it is compared with the average number of background events @xmath0 . the fluctuation of the background is @xmath32 , therefore , we come to the @xmath26 significance as the measure of the distinction from the standard physics . in the conditions of the `` future '' experiment when we want to search for new physics , we know only the average number of the background events and the average number of the signal events , so we have to compare the poisson distributions @xmath33 and @xmath34 to determine the probability to find new physics in the future experiment .    in this paper",
    "we estimate the probability to discover new physics in future experiments . we show that the proper determination of the significance is @xmath35 .",
    "we suggest a method which takes into account systematic errors related to nonexact knowledge of the signal and background cross sections .",
    "we also propose a method for the estimation of exclusion limits on new physics in future experiments . some of presented results has been published in our early paper  @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we give a method for the determination of the probability to find new physics in the future experiment and calculate the probability to discover new physics for the given @xmath36 numbers of background and signal events under the assumption that there are no systematic errors .",
    "in section 3 we estimate the influence of the systematics related to nonexact knowledge of the signal and background cross sections on the probability to discover new physics in future experiments . in section 4",
    "we describe a method for the estimation of exclusion limits on new physics in future experiments . in section 5",
    "we estimate the probability of new physics discovery in future experiments .",
    "section 6 contains concluding remarks .",
    "suppose that for some future experiment we know the average number of the background and signal events @xmath37 .",
    "as it has been mentioned in the introduction , the probability of realization of @xmath17 events in an experiment is given by the poisson distribution    @xmath38    where @xmath22 for the case of the absence of new physics and @xmath23 for the case when new physics exists .",
    "so , to determine the probability to discover new physics in future experiment , we have to compare the poisson distributions with @xmath22 ( standard physics ) and @xmath23 ( new physics ) .",
    "consider , at first , the case when @xmath39 , @xmath40 . in this case",
    "the poisson distributions approach the gaussian distributions     @xmath41    with @xmath42 and @xmath43 or @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath17 is a real number .",
    "note that for the poisson distribution the mean equals to the variance .",
    "the gaussian distribution describes the probability density to realize @xmath17 events in the future experiment provided the average number of events @xmath19 is a given number . in fig.1",
    "we show two gaussian distributions @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath23 = 104 ( @xcite , table.13 , cut 6 ) .",
    "as is clear from fig.1 the common area for these two curves ( the first curve shows the `` standard physics '' events distribution and the second one gives the `` new physics '' events distribution ) is the probability that `` new physics '' can be described by the `` standard physics '' . in other words , suppose we know for sure that new physics takes place and the probability density of the events realization is described by curve ii ( @xmath47 . the probability @xmath48 that the `` standard physics '' ( curve i ( @xmath49 ) ) can imitate new physics ( i.e. the probability that we measure `` new physics '' but we think that it is described by the `` standard physics '' ) is described by common area of curve i and ii .",
    "numerically , we find that    @xmath50dx + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi } \\sigma_1 } \\int_{\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2}^{\\infty}exp[-\\frac{(x-\\sigma_1 ^ 2)^2}{2 \\sigma_1 ^ 2}]dx\\\\    & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi } } [ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2}exp[-\\frac{y^2}{2}]dy + \\int_{\\sigma_2-\\sigma_1}^{\\infty}exp[-\\frac{y^2}{2}]dy ] \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & = & 1 - erf(\\frac{\\sigma_2-\\sigma_1}{\\sqrt{2}}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the transformation of the distributions to standard normal distribution and the exploitation of the equality    @xmath53    allows one to find the point @xmath54 of the intersection of the curves i and ii .",
    "let us discuss the meaning of our definition ( 4 ) .",
    "for @xmath55 we have @xmath56 , i.e. the probability density of the standard physics realization is higher than the probability density of new physics realization",
    ". therefore for @xmath57 we do not have any indication in favour of new physics .",
    "the probability that the number of events is less than @xmath54 is @xmath58 . for @xmath59 @xmath60 that gives evidence in favour of new physics existence .",
    "however the probability of the background events with @xmath59 is different from zero and is equal to @xmath61 .",
    "so we have two types of the errors .",
    "for @xmath62 we do not have any evidence in favour of new physics ( even in this case the probabilty of new physics realization is different from zero ) .",
    "for @xmath63 we have evidence in favour of new physics .",
    "however for @xmath59 the fluctuations of the background can imitate new physics .",
    "so the probability that standard physics can imitate new physics has two components @xmath64 and @xmath65 and it is equal to @xmath66 . if @xmath48 equals to @xmath67 new physics will never be found in the experiment , if @xmath48 equals to @xmath68 the first measurement with probability one has to answer the question about presence or absence of new physics ( this case is not realized for poisson distribution ) . in other words",
    "one can say that the area of intersection of the probability density functions of the pure background and the background plus signal is the measure of the future experiment undiscovery potential .",
    "as follows from formula ( 4 ) the role of the significance @xmath69 plays    @xmath70    note that in refs.@xcite the following criterion of the signal discovery has been used .",
    "the signal was assumed to be observable if @xmath71 upper confidence level for the background event rate is equal to @xmath71 lower confidence level for background plus signal @xmath72 .",
    "the corresponding significance is similar to our significance @xmath73 .",
    "the difference is that in our approach the probability @xmath48 that new physics is described by standard physics is equal to @xmath74 .",
    "it means that for @xmath75 the probability @xmath48 is correspondingly @xmath76 , @xmath77 in accordance with a general picture . as it has been mentioned in the introduction two definitions of the significance",
    "are mainly used in the literature : @xmath3  @xcite and @xmath4  @xcite . the significance @xmath73 is expressed in terms of the significances @xmath26 and @xmath27 as @xmath78 .    for @xmath79 ( the search for higgs boson through @xmath28 decay mode )",
    "we find that    @xmath80    it means that for @xmath81 ( according to a common convention the @xmath82 confidence level means a new physics discovery ) the real significance is @xmath83 , that corresponds to @xmath84  ( fig.2 ) .    for the case",
    "@xmath85 , @xmath86 , where for @xmath87 the values of @xmath88 are @xmath89 , correspondingly .",
    "for not too high values of @xmath0 and @xmath90 , we have to compare the poisson distributions directly .",
    "again for the poisson distribution @xmath91 with the area of definition for nonnegative integers we can define @xmath92 for real @xmath93 as    @xmath94 , < n > ) , & x > 0 .    \\cr   \\displaystyle \\tilde p(x , < n > ) = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll }                 0 ,         & x < 0 , \\\\       p([x ] , < n > ) ,         & x \\ge 0 .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    it is evident that    @xmath95    so , the generalization of the previous determination of @xmath48 in our case is straightforward , namely , @xmath48 is nothing but the common area of the curves described by @xmath96 ( curve i ) and @xmath97 ( curve ii ) ( see , fig.3 ) .",
    "one can find that @xmath98 , where    @xmath99    @xmath100 ,    @xmath101 ,    @xmath102 = @xmath103 ( see , for example , @xcite ) and @xmath104.$ ]    numerical results are presented in tables 1 - 6 .",
    "as it follows from these tables for finite values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 the deviation from asymptotic formula ( 4 ) is essential .",
    "for instance , for @xmath105 , @xmath106   @xmath107 . for @xmath108   @xmath109 , whereas asymptotically for @xmath110 we find @xmath111 .",
    "similar situation takes place for @xmath29 .",
    "in the previous section we determined the statistical error @xmath48 ( the probability that `` new physics '' is described by `` standard physics '' ) . in this section",
    "we investigate the influence of the systematical errors related to a nonexact knowledge of the background and signal cross sections on the probability @xmath48 not to confuse a new physics with the old one .",
    "denote the born background and signal cross sections as @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "an account of one loop corrections leads to @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where typically @xmath116 and @xmath117 are o(0.5 ) .",
    "two loop corrections at present are not known .",
    "so , we can assume that the uncertainty related with nonexact knowledge of cross sections is around @xmath116 and @xmath117 correspondingly .",
    "in other words , we assume that the exact cross sections lie in the intervals @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the average number of background and signal events lie in the intervals    @xmath120    and    @xmath121    where @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "to determine the probability that the new physics is described by the old one , we again have to compare two poisson distributions with and without new physics but in distinction from section 2 we have to compare the poisson distributions in which the average numbers lie in some intervals .",
    "so , a priori the only thing we know is that the average numbers of background and signal events lie in the intervals ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , but we do not know the exact values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to determine the probability that the new physics is described by the old one , consider the worst case   when we think that new physics is described by the minimal number of average events    @xmath124    due to the fact that we do not know the exact value of the background cross section , consider the worst case when the average number of background events is equal to @xmath125 .",
    "so , we have to compare the poisson distributions with @xmath126    @xmath127 and @xmath128 . using the result of the previous section ,",
    "we find that for case @xmath129 the effective significance is    @xmath130    for the limiting case @xmath131 , we reproduce formula ( 5 ) . for not too high values of @xmath132 and @xmath133 , we have to use the results of the previous section ( tables 1 - 6 ) .    as an example consider the case when @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 ( typical situation for sleptons search ) . in this case",
    "we find that + @xmath137    @xmath138    @xmath139    @xmath140 + the difference between cms adopted significance @xmath141 ( that corresponds to the probability @xmath142 ) and the significance @xmath143 taking into account systematics related to nonexact knowledge of background cross section is factor 3.6 . the direct comparison of the poisson distributions with @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( @xmath146 gives @xmath147 .",
    "another example is with @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath134 .",
    "for such example we have @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "so , we see that an account of the systematics related to nonexact knowledge of background cross sections is very essential and it decreases the lhc susy discovery potential .",
    "in this section we generalize the results of the previous sections to obtain exclusion limits on signal cross section ( new physics ) .",
    "suppose we know the background cross section @xmath155 and we want to obtain bound on signal cross section @xmath14 which depends on some parameters ( masses of new particles , coupling constants , ... ) and describes some new physics beyond standard model .",
    "again as in section 2 we have to compare two poisson distributions with and without new physics .",
    "the results of section 2 are trivially generalized for the case of the estimation of exclusion limits on signal cross section and , hence , on parameters ( masses , coupling constants , ... ) of new physics .",
    "consider at first the case when @xmath156 , @xmath157 and the poisson distributions approach the gaussian distributions . as it has been mentioned in section 2",
    "the common area of the gaussian curves with background events and with background plus signal events is the probability that `` new physics '' can be described by the `` standard physics '' .",
    "for instance , when we require the probability that `` new physics '' can be described by the `` standard physics '' is less or equal @xmath158 ( @xmath73 in formula ( 5 ) is larger than 1.64 ) it means that the formula    @xmath159    gives us @xmath160 exclusion limit on the average number of signal events @xmath1 . in general case when we require the probability that `` new physics '' can be described by the `` standard physics '' is more or less @xmath161 the formula    @xmath162    allows us to obtain @xmath163 exclusion limit on signal cross section . here",
    "@xmath164 is determined by the formula  ( 4 )  , @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 , i.e. we suppose that @xmath168 .",
    "it should be stressed that in fact the requirement that `` new physics '' with the probability more or equal to @xmath161 can be described by the `` standard physics '' is our definition of the exclusion limit as @xmath169 probability for signal cross section . from the formula ( 14 )",
    "we find that    @xmath170    for the case of not large values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 we have to compare the poisson distributions directly and the corresponding method has been formulated in section 2 . as an example in table 7 we give @xmath160 exclusion limits on the signal cross section for @xmath171 and for different values of background cross sections .",
    "formulae ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) do not take into account the influence of the systematical errors related to nonexact knowledge of the background cross sections on the exclusion limits for signal cross section . to take into account such systematics we have to use the results of section 3 .",
    "the corresponding generalization of the formulae ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) is straightforward , namely :    @xmath172    @xmath173    remember that @xmath116 describes theoretical uncertainty in the calculation of the background cross section . as an example , in table 8 we give @xmath160 exclusion limits on the signal cross section for @xmath174 and for different values of background cross sections .",
    "note that in refs.@xcite different and strictly speaking `` ad hoc '' methods to derive exclusion limits in future experiments has been suggested .",
    "as is seen from fig.4 the essential differences in values of the exclusion limits take place .",
    "let us compare these methods by the use of the equal probability test  @xcite .",
    "in order to estimate the various approaches of the exclusion limit determination we suppose that new physics exists , i.e. the value @xmath1 equals to one of the exclusion limits from fig.4 and the value @xmath0 equals to the corresponding value of expected background .",
    "then we apply the equal probability test to find critical value @xmath175 for hypotheses testing in future measurements . here",
    "a zero hypothesis is the statement that new physics exists and an alternative hypothesis is the statement that new physics is absent . after calculation of the type i error @xmath64 ( the probability that the number of observed events will be equal to or less than the critical value @xmath175 ) and the type ii error @xmath65 ( the probability that the number of observed events will be greater than the critical value @xmath175 in the case of absence of new physics ) we can compare the methods . in table 9",
    "the comparison result is shown . as is seen from this table the `` typical experiment '' approach  @xcite gives too small values of exclusion limit .",
    "the difference in the 90%  cl definition is the main reason of the difference between our result and the exclusion limit from ref .",
    "we require that @xmath168",
    ". in ref  @xcite the criterion for determination exclusion limits : @xmath176 and @xmath177 is used , i.e. the experiment will observe with probability at least @xmath178 at most a number of events such that the limit obtained at the @xmath179 confidence level excludes the corresponding signal   as normalized @xmath48 ( @xmath180 ) we have the result close to ref .  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath181 corresponds to @xmath182 , i.e. @xmath183 . ] .",
    "in section 2 we determined the probability @xmath48 that `` new physics '' can be described by the `` standard physics '' .",
    "but it is also very important to determine the probabilty of new physics discovery in future experiment . according to common definition @xcite the new physics discovery corresponds to the case when the probability that background can imitate signal is less than @xmath82 or in terms of the probabilty less than @xmath184 ( here of course we neglect any possible systematical errors ) .",
    "so we require that the probability @xmath185 of the background fluctuations for @xmath186 is less than @xmath187 , namely @xmath188 the probability @xmath189 that the number of signal events will be bigger than @xmath190 is equal to @xmath191    it should be stressed that @xmath187 is a given number and @xmath192 is a function of @xmath187 .",
    "usually physicists claim the discovery of phenomenon @xcite if the probability of the background fluctuation is less than @xmath193 that corresponds to @xmath194   is wrong . ] .",
    "so from the equation ( 18 ) we find @xmath190 and estimate the probabilty @xmath189 that an experiment will satisfy the discovery criterion .",
    "as an example consider the search for standard higgs boson with a mass @xmath195 at the cms detector .",
    "for total luminosity @xmath196 one can find @xcite that @xmath197 , @xmath198 .",
    "using the formulae ( 18 , 19 ) for @xmath199 ( @xmath82 discovery criterion ) we find that @xmath200 .",
    "it means that for total luminosity @xmath201 the cms experiment will discover at @xmath202 level standard higgs boson with a mass @xmath203 with a probabilty 96(73 ) percent .",
    "an account of uncertainties related to nonexact knowledge of background cross section is straightforward and it is based on the results of section 3 .",
    "suppose uncertainty in the calculation of exact cross section is determined by parameter @xmath204 , i.e. the exact cross section lies in the interval @xmath205 and the exact value of average number of events lies in the interval @xmath206 . taking into account formulae ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) we have the formulae    @xmath207    @xmath191    as an application of formulae ( 20,21 ) consider the case @xmath208 ( typical case for the search for supersymmetry at lhc ) .",
    "for such values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 we have @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 . for @xmath204= 0 .",
    ", 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 we find that @xmath212 = 0.9998 , 0.9938 , 0.8793 , 0.1696 , correspondingly .",
    "so , we see that the uncertainty in the calculations of background cross section is extremely essential for the determination of the lhc discovery potential . some other examples are presented in tables 10 - 15 .",
    "let us consider the random variable `` luminosity of @xmath193 discovery claim '' for predicted phenomenon in future experiment .",
    "fig.5 illustrates the behaviour of this value for above example @xmath213 at integrated luminosity @xmath214 .",
    "as follow from fig.5(b ) we can point out average luminosity of @xmath193 discovery claim @xmath215 and estimate the accuracy of this prediction .",
    "as seems it is very important parameter for comparison of proposals of future experiments .",
    "in this paper we determined the probability to discover the new physics in the future experiments when the average number of background @xmath0 and signal events @xmath1 is known .",
    "we have found that in this case the role of significance plays @xmath216 in comparison with often used expressions for the significances @xmath217 and @xmath218 .    for @xmath219",
    "we have found that @xmath220 . for not too high values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , when the deviations from the gaussian distributions are essential ,",
    "our results are presented in tables 1 - 6 .",
    "we proposed a method for taking into account systematical errors related to the nonexact knowledge of background and signal events .",
    "an account of such kind of systematics is very essential in the search for supersymmetry and leads to an essential decrease in the probability to discover the new physics in the future experiments .",
    "we also proposed methods for the estimation of exclusion limits on new physics and the probability of the new physics discovery in future experiments .",
