    "trapping and laser - cooling of single ions , has enabled substantial advance in applications as diverse as quantum information processing  @xcite , creation of precise clocks  @xcite and fundamental research on quantum phenomena@xcite . here",
    "we present a new application based on laser - cooled ions which extends the boundaries of nanoscopic imaging to the single particle limit .",
    "we implement a transmission microscope using an intrinsically deterministic ion source based on extracting single laser - cooled @xmath0ca@xmath1 ions from a linear segmented paul trap  @xcite .",
    "this offers several advantages over microscopy with conventional particle sources - in particular , a higher signal - to - noise ratio  ( snr ) , especially at low exposures and an higher information gain per particle .",
    "this can be increased even further , when combined with the bayes experimental design method , which allows for maximizing the information gain for each individual particle probe .",
    "our apparatus was conceived for ion implantation as well , because besides the favourable statistical properties , it also provides an ultracold monochromatic ion beam where ultimately the phase space occupation in transversal and longitudinal direction is limited by the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "exactly the same characteristics renders it also favourable for imaging .",
    "these different applications are highly complementary , since microscopy - or more precisely alignment by imaging of the sample - is essential for an accurate absolute positioning of dopants , free of parallax errors .",
    "the experimental setup is based on a paul trap , comprising four micro - fabricated alumina chips , which are arranged in an x - shaped configuration and two pierced end - caps ( see figure  [ fig : trap]a ) .",
    "each chip consists of 11 electrodes to shape the potential in the axial direction .",
    "the trap is operated at frequencies @xmath2mhz and 1.4@xmath3mhz for the axial and radial directions , respectively .",
    "calcium ions are generated by photo - ionization and laser cooled on the s@xmath4 to p@xmath4 dipole transition .",
    "other ion species are created by a commercial ion gun   which is attached to the vacuum chamber .",
    "this allows for direct loading of ions into the trap along the axial direction .    ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",height=151 ] , title=\"fig:\",height=147 ]    in order to achieve a high repetition rate of the ion extraction , an automated loading of a predefined number of ions is implemented .",
    "initially a random number of ions is trapped and doppler - cooled using laser light near 397@xmath3 nm .",
    "the ion number is counted by imaging the ion fluorescence on a ccd - camera .",
    "excess ions are removed by lowering the axial trapping potential with a predefined voltage sequence .",
    "the cold ions are extracted along the axial direction of the trap by applying an acceleration voltage ranging from 0 to -6@xmath3kv , to one end - cap .",
    "this voltage is controlled by a fast solid - state switch with a jitter of less than 1@xmath3ns . the extraction time is triggered to the phase of the radio - frequency trap - drive ( @xmath5mhz ) .",
    "extraction rates of single ions of up to 3@xmath3hz , can be achieved , corresponding to an average flux of about 0.5@xmath3atto - ampere .",
    "the ions leave the trap passing through a hole with a diameter of 200@xmath6 m in the end - cap .",
    "two pairs of deflection electrodes are used for alignment and scanning of the beam .",
    "they are located at a distance of 46@xmath3 mm and 67@xmath3 mm from the center of the trap ( see figure  [ fig : trap]b ) . in order to focus the ion beam",
    ", a electrostatic einzel - lens is placed 332@xmath3 mm from the trap .",
    "it is constructed from three coaxially arranged ring shaped electrodes with an open aperture of 4@xmath3 mm . in order to minimize spherical aberration",
    ", the geometry parameters are optimized with numerical simulations of the electrostatic field  @xcite .",
    "chromatic aberration is suppressed because of the narrow velocity distribution the of ions . for the time of flight we measure a half width half maximum spread of @xmath7ps .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity spread of @xmath8 m/s at an typical average speed of about @xmath9 m/s .",
    "microscopy is implemented by placing a partially transmissive object on a three - axis translation stage .",
    "this can be either a nano - structured test sample or a profiling edge .",
    "the transmitted ions are detected by a secondary electron multiplier .",
    "image information is generated by recording transmission events for a well defined number of extractions while scanning the object position in the focal plane .",
    "in electron or ion microscopy poor snr generally can be overcome by increasing the exposure time or the current .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the poissonian statistics of the sources in use .",
    "for some applications however , it is important to minimize the current , as for example where high irradiation causes inconvenient charging  @xcite , contamination or even damage  @xcite to delicate samples .",
    "however , with conventional poissonian sources the snr becomes increasingly worse when going to lower currents .",
    "thus effectively lowering the information gain per particle .",
    ", height=188 ]    in order to solve this problem we employ a deterministic source , which provides an higher snr compared to poissonian sources , especially when approaching the single particle regime .",
    "this remains valid even if a detector of finite quantum efficiency is used , leading to binomial statistics .",
    "figure  [ fig : microscopy flowchart ] shows how the single ion microscope is implemented in the experiment .    as an example figure  [ fig : microscopy_example]a ) shows the result of an imaging scan of a optical waveguide - cavity structure made from diamond  @xcite , using exactly one ion at each position , with a resolution of ( 25x25)nm@xmath10 .",

    "we use the bayes experimental design method@xcite to image transmissive structures with optimal efficiency : the algorithm optimizes the probing position for the next probing event by maximizing the expected information gain .",

    "first we introduce and explain the bayesian method on an abstract level . then an example is given by means of a simple profiling scan , demonstrating how the radius and the position of the beam can be obtained by applying this method . in a second example an algorithm is presented which is able to find and determine the exact lateral position of a circular hole structure with optimal efficiency .        in the bayesian concept of probability ,",
    "the information or knowledge about the value of a parameter @xmath20 , is represented by a probability distribution function ( pdf ) . in the context of measurement",
    ", the bayes update rule allows for subsequently incorporating new information from the outcome @xmath21 of a measurement , into the _ prior _ pdf @xmath22 , which represents the pre - existing information .",

    "the bayes experimental design routine ( see figure  [ fig : bayes flowchart ] ) is implemented as follows .",
    "the initial prior , a three dimensional joint pdf of the parameters , position @xmath32 , sigma radius @xmath19 and detector efficiency @xmath16 , is calculated from an initial guess of these parameters .",
    "the marginals of the prior can be uniform or an educated guess _ e.g. _ a gaussian distribution .",
    "it is implemented numerically , being a three dimensional grid of equidistant , weighted and normalized sampling points . in order to calculate the utility ,",
    "the posterior pdf is calculated by applying the bayes update  ( [ eq : bayes update rule ] ) for each sampling point and the integrals are replaced by sums over all sampling points .",
    "the maximizing algorithm is now realized by calculating the utility for equally spaced profiling edge positions within the interval of interest , and recursively repeating this calculation for a smaller interval around the position with the highest utility .",
    "five recursions were found to be sufficient to reach the required accuracy without incurring excessive computational expense . using the measurement outcome of the real experiment performed at the calculated optimal profiling edge position ,",

    "this is also a practical example for sample alignment , since for many applications it is useful to know the exact lateral position of a sample with respect to the beam focus . for this purpose two",
    "perpendicular profiling edges as used in the beam radius measurement could equally be employed . however , for practical reasons , it might be more convenient to use a simple hole structure as a marker , which is in close proximity to a structure of interest .",
    "the experiment is parametrized by the lateral position of the center of the circular hole , its radius as well as the 1@xmath39-radius of the ion beam and the detector efficiency .",
    "the radius of the beam and the detector efficiency were kept constant at 25@xmath3 nm and 95@xmath3% respectively .",

    "the systematic errors resulting from the deviations of the shape to the parametrization ( ideal circle ) are difficult to quantify , since the precise extent of this deviation is unknown .",
    "however , the accuracy of the results apply to an ideal circular shape , which could be available in other experiments .",
    "besides imaging , the apparatus is also designed for deterministic ion implantation ( see figure  [ fig : implantation flowchart ] ) on the nanometer scale .",
    "this would allow for the fabrication of scalable solid state quantum devices , where individual dopants are coupled by their mutual dipolar magnetic interaction .",
    "our focus is on systems of coupled nitrogen vacancy color centres  @xcite , coupled single phosphorous nuclear spins in silicon  @xcite and cerium or praseodymium in yttrium orthosilicate  @xcite .",

    "transmissive structures can be used for referencing .",
    "imaging these markers with the same source which is used for the implantation , allows for the accurate alignment of dopants relative to this markers , free of parallax errors .",
    "depending on the application , it can be necessary to use a different ion species for the imaging to avoid contamination of the sample .",
    "for this purpose , it has to be considered that the energy of the different species remain the same , in order to avoid different spatial positions of the beam focus as a result of inconsistent deflection .",
