    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in ultracold atomic gas clouds with repulsive and attractive interatomic interactions @xcite have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental interest in recent years . besides the studies using the bosonic atoms , growing interest is focused on the cooling of fermionic atoms @xcite .",
    "cooling of trapped fermionic atoms to a temperature regime where a fermi gas can be considered as degenerate has been possible by sympathetic cooling in the presence of a second boson or fermion component .",
    "quantum degeneracy was first reached with mixtures of bosonic @xmath4li and fermionic @xmath5li atoms @xcite .",
    "later , experiments to cool mixtures of @xmath6na and @xmath5li @xcite , as well as @xmath0rb and @xmath1k @xcite , to ultralow temperatures succeeded .",
    "the bose gas , which can be cooled evaporatively , is used as a coolant , the fermionic system being in thermal equilibrium with the cold bose gas through boson - fermion interaction in the region of overlapping of the systems .",
    "collisional interaction between bosons and fermions greatly affect the properties of the degenerate mixture .",
    "theoretical considerations predict the phenomenon of component separation for systems with a positive coupling constant @xcite , instabilities and significant modification of the properties of individual component in a case of boson - fermion attraction @xcite .",
    "effect of density fluctuations in a bose condensate on the fermion - fermion interaction with relevant implications for the achievement of fermionic superfluidity has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the presence of a sufficiently attractive boson - fermion interaction can bring about the formation of stable fermionic bright solitons @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous collapse of the two species has been observed in a @xmath7 mixture by modugno and co - workers @xcite .",
    "k and rb atoms were prepared in doubly polarized states @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . as was shown , as the number of bosons is increased there is an instability value @xmath10 at which a discontinues leakage of the bosons and fermions occurs , and collapse of boson and fermion clouds is observed .",
    "the collapse was found for the following critical numbers of bosons and fermions : @xmath11 . for investigating the stability diagram of the k - rb system the mean- field model of gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) type , coupled to the thomas - fermi equation for fermions has been used @xcite .",
    "the ground state and the stability of the system against collapse was considered with an imaginary - time evolution scheme .",
    "the signature of the instability is the failure of the convergence procedure toward the ground state of the system , characterizing by an indefinite growth of the central density @xcite .    in this paper",
