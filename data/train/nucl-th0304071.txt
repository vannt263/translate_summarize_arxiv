    "typical temperatures are around @xmath14 @xcite with @xmath15 being the temperature in billion degrees .",
    "the role of light neutron - rich nuclei in the @xmath16-process , e.g.  in type ii supernovae , was analyzed in @xcite ; here a temperature range of @xmath17 is relevant . because of the missing coulomb barrier for neutron - induced reactions , astrophysically relevant energies for the @xmath0li(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3li  reaction are around @xmath18 .",
    "hence , for both scenarios the cross section has to be determined for energies below @xmath19kev . in this paper",
    "all energies are given in the center - of - mass system .",
    "the @xmath0b(@xmath4,@xmath2)@xmath3c  reaction leads to a hot part of the @xmath20-chain as soon as the proton capture of @xmath9b is faster than the competing @xmath21 decay @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0b(@xmath4,@xmath2)@xmath3c  reaction is especially relevant in low - metallicity stars with high masses where such a proton - rich reaction chain can be faster than the triple-@xmath12 process @xcite , and furthermore the reaction may become important under nova conditions @xcite .",
    "the typical temperature range in both astrophysical scenarios is around several times @xmath25k which corresponds to energies of the gamow window around 50kev @xmath26 300kev .",

    "because of the unstable @xmath9li and @xmath9b nuclei , direct experiments are extremely difficult at astrophysically relevant energies below 500kev .",
