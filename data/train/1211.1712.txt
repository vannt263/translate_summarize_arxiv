    "chemical erosion of a porous medium is a complex process , involving an interplay between flow , transport , reaction and geometry evolution .",
    "the nonlinear couplings between these processes may lead to the formation of intricate dissolution patterns @xcite , the characteristics of which depend strongly on the fluid flow and mineral dissolution rates . in particular , in a broad range of physical conditions , long , finger - like channels or `` wormholes '' are spontaneously formed , where the majority of the flow is focused .",
    "understanding the details of a dissolution process is of fundamental importance in a variety of geological systems , including diagenesis , karst formation , aquifer evolution  @xcite , and melt migration  @xcite .",
    "it also plays an important role in a number of engineering applications , such as dam stability  @xcite , @xmath0 sequestration  @xcite , risk assessment of contaminant migration in groundwater  @xcite , and stimulation of petroleum reservoirs  @xcite .    due to the complexity of the problem , analytical results are scarce and limited to either the initial stages of the process @xcite or the analysis of simple model systems @xcite .",
    "thus most studies of the porous media dissolution rely on extensive numerical work .",
    "a variety of approaches has been followed in modelling , which can be classified into three major categories according to the length scales involved .",
    "the coarsest description is provided by the darcy - scale models  @xcite based on continuum equations with effective variables such as dispersion coefficients , darcy velocity and bulk reactant concentrations . on the other side of the spectrum",
    "are pore - scale numerical simulations  @xcite where the equations for fluid flow , reactant transport and chemical kinetics are solved in an explicitly three - dimensional pore space . naturally , the pore - scale models are much more accurate than the darcy - scale ones but also highly expensive computationally , and thus limited by the system sizes that they can represent",
    ". finally , somewhere in between these two levels of description are the network models  @xcite , which model fluid flow and dissolution in a network of interconnected pipes , with the diameter of each network segment or pipe increased in proportion to the local reactant consumption .",
    "this is also the approach followed in the present work .    in constructing the model",
    ", we are largely following the ideas of hoefner and fogler @xcite but with a few important modifications .",
    "first , we take into account a potential limiting role of the mass transfer of reactants to the pore surface . in that way",
    ", we obtain the description of the system in terms of two dimensionless parameters : the effective damkhler number , @xmath1 , relating the reaction rate to the mean fluid velocity in the pores and another dimensionless number , @xmath2 , measuring the extent to which the dissolution rate is hindered by diffusive transport of reactant across the aperture .    another important novel element that we introduce",
    "is to allow for dynamically changing topology of the network as the dissolution proceeds .",
    "as the diameters of the eroding pores become comparable to the interpore distances , the pores are joined together , thus changing the interconnections within the network .",
    "this allows for a more realistic representation of the evolving topography of the dissolving porous medium .",
    "although the original motivation for the construction of the hoefner and fogler network model @xcite was the analysis of acidization experiments in limestone cores , another natural application of the model is the simulation of early stages of karst formation in the limestone bedding planes which separate the individual strata in the rock . as elucidated by ewers @xcite and dreybrodt  @xcite in a first approximation one may regard a bedding plane as a two - dimensional porous medium with an average pore size comparable to the grain size of the confining rock , thus 2d network models seems to be particularly suited for simulations of such a system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we describe the network model used to represent the evolving porous medium",
    ". results of the numerical simulations are given in secs .",
    "[ phase_diag]-[breakthrough ] .",
    "first , in sec .  [ phase_diag ] we analyze the form of the dissolution patterns as a function of flow velocity and surface reaction rate .",
    "in particular , we identify the regime in which the hierarchical structure of dissolution channels is formed and study their length distribution .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ regular ] we consider the dissolution of regular lattices . finally , in sec .",
    "[ breakthrough ] we consider a problem of optimal injection rate , important in petroleum reservoir stimulation , so as to achieve the maximum increase in permeability for a given amount of reactant  @xcite .",
    "we finish with a summary of our results and conclusions .",
    "the theoretical model used in this work is an extension of the hoefner and fogler scheme @xcite , who have pioneered the application of pore network models to study dissolution processes .",
    "pore - network modelling has been extensively used in simulating single- and multiphase flow in porous media ( see e.g. books by dullien @xcite and sahimi @xcite for a detailed description of different models and the discussion of their predictive abilities )",
    ". however , the applications of pore models to dissolution processes remain scarce @xcite .    in the model ,",
    "the porous medium is represented as a triangular network of cylindrical tubes .",
    "the points where the tubes meet are referred to as nodes .",
    "the nodes can either be placed on a regular hexagonal lattice of lattice constant @xmath3 or randomly , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : przykladowa_siatka ] . in the latter case , a random displacement , uniformly sampled from a value between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ,",
    "is added to the lattice nodes .",
    "each pore is a tube with an initial diameter @xmath6 , which gets enlarged during the dissolution process .",
    "a reactive fluid is injected into the network through a set of _ inlet nodes _ , where the pressure @xmath7 is imposed , and leaves the system through _ outlet nodes _ where the pressure is kept at zero , @xmath8 .",
    "depending on the physical situation we intend to model , the inlet pressure is either kept constant , or it is being adjusted in each time step so as to keep the total flow through the system constant .",
    "the concentration of reactant in the incoming fluid is kept at a constant value of @xmath9 .",
    "the inlet and outlet nodes can either be positioned at separate points within the network or placed along its two opposite boundaries , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemat_po_calosci ] . additionally , periodic boundary conditions are applied along the lateral direction .",
    "fluid flow in the pores is described by the hagen - poiseuille equation for the volumetric flux @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes pressure drop along the pore joining node @xmath12 with node @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the volumetric flux in this pore , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are its diameter and length respectively and @xmath17 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid . at each node",
    ", we also have a continuity condition @xmath18 where the sum is over all the nodes connected by a pore with node @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting system of sparse linear equations can then be solved for pressure values at the nodes .",
    "let us now consider one of the pores comprising the network and study the evolution of its diameter as a function of time .",
    "we assume that the walls of the pore are dissolving according to the linear rate law @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the reactive flux ( the number of absorbed reactant molecules per unit area and unit time ) , @xmath21 is the surface reaction rate and @xmath22 - the reactant concentration at the wall .",
    "the precise meaning of these variables depends on the particular reaction of interest , for example for carbonate dissolution by a strong acid , the respective reaction is @xmath23 in this case @xmath24 is a concentration of @xmath25 ions and @xmath20 describes the flux of hydrogen ions as illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig : schemat_modelu ] .",
    "however , when calcite is dissolved by aqueous @xmath26 at ph values similar to those of natural groundwater , the relevant variable is rather the calcium ion undersaturation @xcite .",
    "note that in general the full chemistry of the carbonate dissolution is more complex @xcite , but a single reactant description is a reasonable approximation in a broad range of chemical conditions @xcite .",
    "additionally , we are taking into account the fact that , in order to take part in the reaction , the reactant first needs to diffuse from the bulk towards the pore surface .",
    "the diffusive flux can be expressed in terms of the difference between the surface concentration , @xmath22 , and the bulk concentration , @xmath24 by using a mass - transfer coefficient or sherwood number  @xcite , @xmath27 here , the fluid bulk mean concentration of the reactant , @xmath24 , also known as the mixing cup concentration is defined in terms of flow - weighted average of the concentration field over the cross - section of the pore : @xmath28 in general , the sherwood number , @xmath29 , depends in a complicated way on reaction rate at the pore surface ( @xmath21 ) but the variation is relatively small  @xcite , bounded by two asymptotic limits : high reaction rates ( transport limit ) , @xmath30 , and low reaction rates ( reaction limit ) , @xmath31 .",
    "in the numerical calculations we approximate @xmath32 by a constant value @xmath33 . additionally , we neglect entrance effects , which otherwise make the sherwood number dependent on the distance from the inlet of the pore , @xmath34 .    by equating the reactive and diffusive fluxes",
    "@xmath35 we can relate the wall concentration @xmath22 to the bulk one @xcite , @xmath36 which can then be used to express the reactive flux in terms of the bulk concentration in the pore @xmath37 where the effective reaction rate is given by @xmath38 as seen from above , the relative importance of reactive and diffusive effects is described by the ratio @xmath39 in sufficiently narrow pores the diffusion is fast and able to keep the concentration field almost uniform across the pore diameter . in such a case , characterized by @xmath40 , the dissolution becomes reaction limited and @xmath41 . in the other limiting case , for wide pores and/or fast reactions , the reaction rate becomes hindered by diffusive transport of reactant across the aperture . as @xmath42 , the dissolution can become entirely diffusion limited with @xmath43 .",
    "next , the concentration of the reactant along the pore can be obtained from the mass balance equation .",
    "neglecting axial diffusion , this leads to @xmath44 where @xmath34 is the coordinate along the axis of the pore . for a pore of a constant diameter",
    ", this can be solved to yield @xmath45 with @xmath46 denoting the concentration of reactant at the inlet of a pore .",
    "finally , the erosion rate of the pore surfaces is described by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the concentration of soluble material and @xmath49 accounts for the stoichiometry of the reaction .",
    "the total volume of a mineral dissolved from the walls of a pore of diameter @xmath50 over time @xmath51 is then @xmath52 in order to keep the model tractable , we assume that the pores are broadening uniformly along their length .",
    "thus the above volume change corresponds to the enlargement of the pore diameter by @xmath53 as seen from the above , the decay of the concentration along the length of the pore is determined by a function @xmath54 which relates the reaction rate to the rate of convective transport .",
    "using @xmath55 and @xmath56 one can rewrite formulae and in a simple form @xmath57 and @xmath58 where the time has been scaled by @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the acid capacity number or volume of solid dissolved by a unit volume of reactant .      the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 characterizing the dissolution in the pores depend on time through @xmath50 and @xmath61 .",
    "additionally , their values can vary across the sample , since the pores have different lengths and diameters and carry different flows . in the following , while characterizing the effects of flow rate and surface reaction rate on the dissolution patterns , we will construct the phase diagram of the patterns in terms of characteristic values of these parameters at @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath3 is the lattice constant of the underlying hexagonal network , @xmath6 is the initial pore diameter , whereas @xmath65 is a characteristic flow in the inlet pores , i.e. @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of inlet pores .",
    "the first of these parameters , @xmath1 , can be interpreted as an effective damkhler number relating the reaction rate to the mean fluid velocity in the pores , whereas @xmath2 , as has already been mentioned , measures the extent to which the dissolution rate is hindered by diffusive transport of reactant across the aperture .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 plays a similar role to the thiele modulus in chemical engineering @xcite which measures the relative importance of diffusion and reaction .",
    "the above - described model is implemented numerically in the following way :    * pressure in each node and flow through each tube are calculated from equations and using multifrontal massively parallel solver ( mumps ) @xcite . * the concentration field in each pore , starting from the inlet ones ,",
    "is then obtained by a repetitive use of eq .   under the assumption that at the pore intersections the flow is divided accordingly to the total volume flux through each tube * finally , the diameters of the pores are updated according to eq .  .",
    "additionally , we introduce the possibility of merging the pores when their diameters become comparable to the interpore distances . to be more specific , when @xmath68 becomes larger than @xmath69 , we replace both pores by a single pore of diameter @xmath70 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ joining ] .",
    "note that in this way we assure that the total reactive surface area before and after merging is the same , the condition which is crucial to guarantee that the overall reactant balance will not change as an effect of merging . on the other hand ,",
    "the total volume of the pores is not conserved during merging and the overall hydrodynamic resistance decreases .",
    "this , however , has only a minor effect on the system , since at the moment of merging the diameters of the pores are large and thus their resistances are almost negligible .",
    "an important parameter controlling the merging process is the ratio of the initial pore diameter @xmath6 to the lattice constant , @xmath3 .",
    "since the condition for merging is @xmath71 , in the systems with larger @xmath72 the pores will merge faster .",
    "in real rocks , the values of pore aspect ratio span a rather broad range , depending on the type of porosity present in the rock structure @xcite : whether it is a network of interconnected microcracks ( crack porosity with aspect ratios as low as @xmath73 ) or intergrain pore space ( equant porosity with aspect ratios of @xmath74 ) .     the points @xmath75 and @xmath76 are joined and the two pores are replaced by a single pore with a diameter equal to @xmath77 . ,",
    "[ fig : da_peda_stale_p ] illustrates typical dissolution patterns for @xmath78 random lattice over a range of different flow and reaction rates .",
    "there is one inflow in the system and three outflows situated at equal distances from the inlet , but not symmetrically .",
    "the pores are initially uniform in diameters .",
    "the widths of the lines representing the pores in the figure are proportional to their diameters . for the sake of clarity , we plot only the pores which have reached @xmath79 at a given time .",
    "the frames in the figure correspond to the breakthrough moment when the dissolution reaches the outlet of the system , that is at least one of the outlet pores have broaden 3 times . unless otherwise stated the value of pore aspect ratio",
    "was taken to be @xmath80 .",
    "the phase diagram is plotted in terms of dimensionless parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , defined in the preceding section . for small @xmath1 , due to the low reaction rate and large flow , the reagent spreads evenly throughout many parallel pores along the main flow path and erodes them almost uniformly , which results in a diffuse , turnip - shaped pattern .",
    "this can be rationalized by noting that the characteristic penetration length of the reactant is , according to eq .",
    "@xmath81 thus for @xmath82 most of the pores along the main flow path will be invaded almost instantaneously .",
    "however , as @xmath1 is increased , the penetration length is reduced and only the pores in the close vicinity of the inlet are invaded at the beginning of the dissolution process .",
    "the reagent is then consumed very quickly and further advancement of the dissolution front is only possible when one of the pores increases its flow rate at the expense of its neighbors . such a competition between different flow paths",
    "is a characteristic feature of the dissolution problems @xcite : a path which gets a slightly larger flow dissolves faster than its neighbors , which decreases its hydraulic resistance and makes the flow there even higher . as a result , an intricate , fractal - like structure of channels is formed , where all the flow and dissolution is focused . the structure becomes increasingly more branched as @xmath1 is increased , with individual branches again competing with each other for the available flow , which leads to the final appearance of a single flowpath joining the inlet and outlet .",
    "the @xmath2 parameter affects the dissolution process in a more subtle way , much less evident compared to the effects caused by @xmath1 . for larger values of @xmath2",
    "we observe more branching in the wormholes and less broadening around the inlet , particularly at higher effective damkhler numbers .",
    "this behaviour is connected with a simple mechanism that leads to a drastic increase of dissolution rate in the widest pores in the reaction ( @xmath83 ) limit - the wider the pore is , the larger its surface area ( @xmath84 ) becomes , so that it consumes more reactant compared to other pores .",
    "this leads to a situation in which increasingly larger amount of reactant is consumed in the first few pores in a given flowpath , and the reactant withdraws from the more remote pores ( see also a more detailed discussion of this effect in the appendix ) .",
    "this effect is most pronounced when a constant flow is imposed on the system . in the constant pressure case , the flow rate increases during the dissolution ,",
    "hence @xmath1 decreases and the reactant is penetrating deeper inside the system , not being spent in the first few pores .",
    "this effect is strongly reduced at larger values of @xmath2 , where the dissolution relatively quickly switches to a transport - limited mechanism , which tends to slow down the dissolution rate as the pore opens , due to the inverse dependence of @xmath85 on the diameter , as observed in eq .  .    the geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig : da_peda_stale_p ] , with point inputs and outputs , is relevant to a number of karst formation problems @xcite .",
    "the point inputs then represents particular sinks through which the water may enter the bedding plane , whereas outputs correspond to the springs draining the area .",
    "ewers @xcite has also modelled such a situation experimentally by creating an artificial model of a bedding plane between the soluble plaster block and a transparent insoluble lower boundary and flushing the system with water through a number of point inlets and outlets .",
    "an example result of such an experiment is presented in fig .",
    "[ ewers ] and bears a lot of resemblance with the patterns obtained by use of a network model    another experimentally important geometry is the one in which the reagent enters through the entire top surface and leaves through the bottom .",
    "this is the geometry relevant to the experiments and simulations by hoefner , fogler and fredd @xcite on the dissolution of limestone blocks and also golfier @xcite on the salt dissolution in a hele - shaw cell . in this geometry",
    "there are no preferred flow paths along which water may flow more rapidly than through others , thus initially many independent wormholes are formed which then compete for the available flow .",
    "results of numerical simulation for different values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for this geometry are presented in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "constant total flow through the system has been imposed in these simulations ( the development of the patterns in the analogous simulations under constant pressure conditions is represented in the movies in the supplementary material @xcite ) . even though an identical initial geometry has been used in each of the runs",

    ", at the breakthrough time for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the fit @xmath88 .",
    "wormholes shorter than @xmath89 and longer than @xmath90 ( with @xmath91 the system length ) were not taken into account in the distribution .",
    "the lengths are normalized by the system length and @xmath92 is normalized by the total number of wormholes in the sample , @xmath93 .",
    "results correspond to a simulation with fixed total flow through the system.,width=321 ]    the overall dependence of the dissolution patterns on @xmath1 and @xmath2 shares many similarities with that observed for point inlets and outlets .",
    "again , the effective damkhler number is the key parameter controlling the penetration length - for small values of @xmath1 , as the penetration length becomes comparable with the size of the system , dissolution is uniform .",
    "then , as @xmath1 is increased , a well - defined reaction front appears , which becomes unstable in the course of evolution .",
    "the linear stability analysis shows that the wavelength of this instability decreases with increasing damkhler number @xcite , which is consistent with the results of present simulations - for @xmath94 one observes long - wavelength undulations of the dissolution front whereas for larger @xmath1 separated wormholes are formed where the majority of the flow and reaction is focused , while most of the pore space is bypassed . to further investigate the scaling of the instability wavelength with the damkhler number we conducted a series of dissolution simulations of regular lattices with uniform pore lengths @xmath3 but with a very small random noise in the initial pore diameter distribution : @xmath95 .",
    "the results show sinusoidal modes developing in the dissolution front , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ waves ] .",
    "the wavelength is inversely proportional to the damkhler number , confirming that penetration length , @xmath96 , is the only important length scale in the early stages of dissolution , which is a common feature of the convection - dominated dissolution processes @xcite .",
    "the wormholes again compete in a process in which the longer wormholes drain flow from the shorter ones , limiting their growth .",
    "this time however , in contrast to the point inlet case , due to the translational invariance of the system the process of wormhole competition becomes self - similar .",
    "the characteristic length between active ( growing ) wormholes increases with time , while the number of active wormholes decreases , which leads to a scale - invariant , power - law distribution of wormhole lengths , @xmath97 were @xmath98 denotes number of wormholes longer than @xmath99 .",
    "the fits to eq .   were performed in the range @xmath100 where the wormholes are well - pronounced and there are relatively many of them , which allows for the adequate statistics .",
    "wormholes shorter than @xmath89 and longer than @xmath90 ( with @xmath91 the system size ) were not taken into account in the distribution : the former because their lengths are influenced by the lattice discretization effects , the latter - because the longest wormholes remain active and the selection process there has not yet been concluded .",
    "the values of the exponent @xmath101 obtained from the fitting procedure over a range of different @xmath1 and @xmath2 numbers are presented in table i. the exponent vary slightly with @xmath2 with the largest values corresponding to the reaction limited case ( small @xmath2 ) . an example distribution of the wormhole lengths obtained at @xmath102 and @xmath103",

    "[ fig : statystyka_dopasowanie_q ] together with the respective fit .",
    "the reported values of @xmath101 in reaction - limited regime ( small @xmath2 ) are in a good agreement with the 2d laplacian needle growth model of wormhole - wormhole competition @xcite , which yields @xmath104 .",

    "[ fig : symmetric ] presents the dissolution patterns obtained for @xmath110 and different @xmath1 in such a system ( for the simulation without pore merging ) .",

    "the width of the wormhole is much larger than the pore scale . around @xmath111 ,",
    "a sudden transition takes place , to an inverted y structure , involving two channels growing sideways at equal angles from the main branch .",

    "initially , a short channel was cut in the center of inlet manifold to induce the localization of the flow . , width=377 ]    to elucidate the origin of the patterns observed in the dissolution of regular lattices , let us consider a simplified triangular network shown in fig .",

    "the flow along side pores is therefore slightly larger than in the central ones at the beginning of the simulation , when resistances of all the pores are the same .",
    "however , at large @xmath1 , when almost all the reactant is spent in the first pores , even a small difference in the flows will be enhanced by the dissolution . as a result , the hydrodynamic resistance of a channel bc will decrease much faster than that of bx , and the concentration of reactant at @xmath120 will be significantly larger than that in @xmath121 . thus the line @xmath122 will continue to grow and soon all of the flow in the system will be concentrated there . on the other hand , for smaller @xmath1 both bx and bc will dissolve almost uniformly . in that case",
    ", the concentration of reactant in @xmath121 will be in fact larger than that in @xmath120 ( since @xmath121 is being fed by two reactant - bearing pores instead of one ) .",
    "the dissolution will then be concentrated in the central channels , and a dendrite - shaped wormhole will be formed .",
    "we expect the shape of the dendrite in this case to be largely independent of the underlying lattice , and in fact similar shapes are observed in the case of random lattices in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . for a regular lattice , an analytical derivation of such a shape",
    "should in principle be possible , which remains a future task .",
    "on the other hand , the inverted y pattern formed at large @xmath1 is strongly connected with the underlying network .",
    "the arms of the inverted y figure propagate along the lattice directions and the pattern will look differently if the network is changed .",
    "it is also strongly unstable , as the arms begin to compete with each other , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : symmetric ] .    the above considerations , although originally pertaining to the regular network , have , in fact , a more general relevance , since they illustrate two basic mechanisms that govern the emergence of dissolution patterns in the network . at small or intermediate @xmath1 diffuse ,",
    "multi - pore patterns are formed in the extended region where the initial concentration of reactant is large .",
    "for large effective damkhler numbers the local pressure drop effects become more important and the dissolution is focused along a thin pore - wide wormhole which is more irregular and branched , reflecting the disorder of initial network .",
    "understanding of the emergence of the dissolution patterns is particularly important in optimization of carbonate reservoir stimulation treatments , where the relevant question is how to get the maximum increase of permeability for a given amount of reactive fluid .",
    "numerical and experimental investigations of reactive flows in porous media  @xcite suggest that there exists an optimum injection rate , which maximizes the permeability gain for a given amount of reactant .",
    "if the injection rate is relatively small , a large portion of the reactant is wasted by the unproductive dissolution of the inlet pores while the overall increase in permeability remains small . on the other hand , for very large injection rates",
    ", the reactant is exhausted on a uniform opening of all of the pores in the system , which is also inefficient in terms of permeability increase .",
    "the optimum flow rate must give rise to spontaneous channeling , since the reactant is then used to create a small number of highly permeable wormholes , which transport the flow most efficiently . to quantify the optimization with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we measured the total volume of reactive fluid , @xmath123 , that must be injected into the pores to obtain the breakthrough , which we identify with the moment when the diameter of at least one of the outlet pores increases by a factor of @xmath124 .",

    "the increase of @xmath146 at very high flows ( low @xmath149 ) is connected with the fact that a significant portion of the reactant is then simply flushed through the system , not reacting with the walls .",
