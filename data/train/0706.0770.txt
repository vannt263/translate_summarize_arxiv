    "ic342 is a nearby ( 1.8mpc ; see  @xcite for a review ) , almost face - on ( @xmath8 ;  @xcite ) late - type sc / scd galaxy in the maffei group which is one of the closest groups to our galaxy with well developed spiral arms .",
    "infrared and radio observations indicated moderately strong nuclear starburst activities ( @xcite ;  @xcite ) in ic342 , whereas x - ray observations with _",
    "einstein _",
    "@xcite , _ rosat _",
    "@xcite , and _ asca _",
    "@xcite indicated that the majority of the x - ray emission came from a few ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "ulxs are defined as off - nuclear x - ray sources whose luminosities are greater than @xmath9 , the eddington luminosity of a @xmath10 black hole .",
    "one of the ulx identified , x3 ( based on the designations from  @xcite ) was located near the galactic center , and was reported to be coincident with the center of ic342 at the resolutions of the _ asca _  ( fwhm@xmath11 ) and _ rosat _  ( fwhm@xmath12 ) data .",
    "optical and near infrared observations of the inner region of ic342 revealed the presence of a nuclear star cluster  @xcite .",
    "photometrically distinct , luminous , and compact stellar clusters were often found in the centers of late - type spiral galaxies , such as ngc6240  @xcite and ngc1808  @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied high spatial resolution ( fwhm@xmath13 millimeter interferometric observations of the @xmath14 emission of ic342 and concluded that gaseous matter were accumulating at the nucleus through streaming motions .",
    "this suggested that star cluster formation could be a repetitive process and this process could have provided the fuel for starburst activities . as a result ,",
    "if x3 were indeed associated with the galactic center , its emission may not be from a single ulx , but could be associated with the nuclear star cluster .",
    "however , the early identification of x3 as an ulx was uncertain due to limited resolution of the early x - ray data .    the higher light collecting power and lower background level of _ xmm - newton",
    "_  provided a clearer picture of the nuclear x - ray source x3 .",
    "a 10  ksec observation of ic342 was taken with the pn - ccd camera and two mos - ccd cameras using the medium filter on 2001 february 11 .",
    "two independent studies by @xcite ( hereafter k03 ) and  @xcite ( hereafter b03 ) on the data set yielded similar results , with a total of about 35 sources detected .",
    "the slope of the x - ray luminosity function was determined to be @xmath15 , which was consistent with other starburst galaxies and galactic high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) . however , there were differences in the two studies about the nature and properties of the nuclear source .",
    "k03 found that the nuclear x - ray source was consistent with the instrumental psf of a point source located @xmath16 from the galactic center , suggesting a off - center scenario .",
    "k03 fit the nuclear source with a power - law + blackbody spectral model ( @xmath17 kev , @xmath18@xmath19 , photon index @xmath20 ) and found the disk temperature was about 5 to 10 times lower than expected .",
    "such cool disk system might be evidence of imbhs ( @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we could not ignore the scenario of a stellar mass black hole with inner disk outflows during high accretion rate period  @xcite , and that of magnetic corona atop a cool accretion disk in which x - rays were reprocessed to give soft photons  @xcite .",
    "the black hole mass of the nuclear x - ray source was estimated to be between 220  @xmath21 and 15000  @xmath21 ( k03 ) . together with the unphysical spectral fit with the broken power - law model",
    ", k03 ruled out the possibility of an accreting stellar mass black hole with beamed relativistic jet emission . on the other hand",
    ", b03 suggested that the nuclear source was extended , mainly in the soft band , and its emission could be fit by a model of a point source plus a uniform disk with a radius of @xmath22 , which was consistent with a supernova heated hot gas .",
    "moreover , the nuclear source spectrum was fit by b03 with a mekal + power - law model ( @xmath23 kev , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26@xmath19 ) , including contribution from the fe l - shell emission complexes at @xmath27 kev and @xmath28 kev .",
    "they found that a large fraction of the x - ray emission was likely to be thermal in origin .",
    "the relative contribution of the mekal component to the total absorbed flux was about 45% and 1% in the 0.52 kev and 210 kev band respectively , leading b03 to suggest that the hard component might be due to a number of circumnuclear x - ray binaries .",
    "the limited astrometric accuracy and spatial resolution of the previous x - ray observations restricted our ability to determine the exact nature of the x - ray properties at the center of ic342 . in this paper",
    ", we report a new high resolution ( fwhm @xmath29 ) _ chandra _  _ x - ray observatory _ observation of the starburst galaxy ic342 . the observation and the data reduction procedures of the x - ray data , and the associated optical data for comparison ,",

    "we discuss the nature of nuclear x - ray emission of ic342 in section  [ s : nuclear ] and we present a summary of our findings in section  [ s : summary ] .",
    "ic342 was observed on 2006 april 2 starting at 15:15:44 ( ut ) with the _ chandra _  high resolution camera ( hrc - i ) for a total exposure time of 12.16 ksec , with a photon energy range of 0.08  ",
    "the nominal pointing of the instrument was near the center of the galaxy and the total region covered by the observation was @xmath1 which covered most of structure of the galaxy , including the spiral arms .",
    "the field of view of the _ chandra _  observation is presented in figure  [ f : dss ] ( left ) , overlaid with the digital sky survey ( dss ) image of ic342 .",
    "the central @xmath30 of ic342 is magnified in figure  [ f : dss ] ( right ) for reference .",
    "the x - ray data was analyzed using the chandra interactive analysis of observations software package ( ciao ) v.3.3 and chandra calibration database ( caldb ) v.3.2.1 software applied on the level-2 event fits file .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "data had gone through standard data processing ( sdp , or the pipeline ) with updated calibration procedures , including instrumental corrections and filtering good time intervals , applied .",
    "there were 4 other archival _ chandra _",
    "ic342 data sets : three axaf ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) observations ( each 10 ksec ) in sub - array mode centered on one of the ulx ( x1 ) , and one 3 ksec hrc - i observation . for the 3 acis - s data",
    ", the detectors did not cover the nuclear region of ic342 as the sub - array mode was used to reduce pile - up .",
    "the 3 ksec hrc - i observation , on the other hand , had insufficient signal for source detection at the galactic center . therefore only the 12 ksec hrc - i image was analyzed in this work .",
    "ic342 was also observed 4 times between 2001 and 2005 with _ xmm - newton_. among these 4 observations , the data taken in year 2001 were studied by b03 and k03 . we have retrieved the 2001 epic data for the analysis of x - ray spectrum of the nuclear sources .",
    "the event files were reprocessed and filtered with the _ xmm - newton _  science analysis software ( sas v7.1.0 ) and we used the heasoft v6.2 and xspec v12.3.1 packages to perform spectral analysis .",
    "we also analyzed archival _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ )  broadband and emission - line images of ic342 for comparisons with the x - ray data .",
    "we searched the _ hst _  data archive for images with pointings that included the central part of the galaxy .",
    "the calibrated and data - quality images were retrieved , with preliminary ccd processing , including bias and dark subtraction , flat - fielding , and shutter - shading correction , automatically applied using calibration frames closest to the time of the observations .",
    "the fields were inspected to ensure that the galactic nucleus did not fall on the boundaries on any of the ccd chips .",
    "we found that most of the archival images were saturated at the central region of the galaxy .",
    "the only unsaturated images were the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images taken on 1996 january 7 in broadband _",
    "( f555w ) , _ i _ ( f814w ) , and in narrow - band h@xmath7  ( f656n ) , and they were selected for comparison with our _ chandra _  hrc - i data .",
    "the exposure time of each frame was 260 sec each for _ v _ and _ b _ band and 500 sec for h@xmath7 .",
    "mosaics were produced using the stsdas task wmosaic which removed known relative rotations and geometric distortions of the individual wpfc2 chips .",
    "astrometry of the calibrated _ hst _",
    "images were corrected using the coordinates from the usno - b1.0 catalog  @xcite for comparison with the positions of x - ray sources in the same reference frame .",
    "details of the astrometric registration of the data will be described in section  [ s : anlyast ] .",
    "we performed source detection on the x - ray image using the wavdetect algorithm  @xcite which employs a wavelet method to detect point sources .",
    "this algorithm was selected because it is able to effectively identify extended sources with properly chosen wavelet scales ; this is important for the analysis of our _ chandra _  ic342 image , which has an extended source near the galactic center .",
    "source detection results from the wavdetect algorithm depend on two parameters , the significance threshold  ( _ sigthresh _ ) and the image scale .",
    "we set the wavelet radii , in pixels , to be ` 1.0 1.414 2.0 2.828 4.0 5.657 8.0 11.314 16.0 ' and the parameter _",
    "sigthresh _ to be @xmath31 for all runs .",
    "this detection threshold corresponds to less than one false detection in the _ chandra _  hrc - i field due to statistical fluctuations in the background  @xcite .",
    "the runtime of wavdetect depends heavily on the selected resolution of the image , and a resolution of @xmath32 was considered to be the practical size limit for the input data on most desktop computers .",
    "we tested running wavedetect on the central part of the image containing the galactic center with binning factors 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , and 32 .",
    "an exposure map , created using ciao , was applied for each binning to normalize the images and to correct for instrumental artifacts caused by imperfections of the _ chandra _  mirror and detector , especially at the edges of the field .",
    "we found the list of sources detected depended on the binning factor applied",
    ". a binning factor of 4 was used in the final data reduction as a compromise between spatial resolution and faint source detection .",
    "the _ chandra _  field was divided into 4 equal quadrants with overlapping at the central regions before being recombined to the full - frame .",
    "the final image scale with a binning factor of 4 was @xmath33/pixel .    to generate the final source list , we applied two additional selection criteria for the sources identified by the wavdetect algorithm :    1 .",
    "the source should be detected in at least 2 different binning images , with one of them being the one with a binning factor of 4 .",
    "the s / n of the source had to be greater than 3 in the binning factor 4 image .    with these selection criteria we detected a total of 23 x - ray sources in our _ chandra _  hrc - i ic342 image .",
    "properties of the detected sources are summarized in table  [ t : sourcelist ] .",
    "a total of 14 and 8 of our sources were also previously detected in the _ xmm - newton _  ( b03 ; k03 ) and the _ rosat _  observations  @xcite respectively .",
    "the alternate _ xmm - newton _  and _ rosat _  source ids are listed in table  [ t : sourcelist ] .",
    "the locations of all sources detected are shown overlaid on the dss image in figure  [ f : dss ] .",
    "a majority of the identified sources are located in the spiral arms of the galaxy , as previously noted by b03 and k03 with _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "using the chandra deep field data  @xcite , we estimated that there could be 910 background objects within our @xmath1 _ chandra _  frame , implying that @xmath34% of the sources currently detected could be background objects .    with the high resolution _",
    "chandra _",
    "hrc - i image , we were able to resolve for the first time x - ray emission from the center of ic342 into two distinct components , namely c12 , the brighter and extended component near the center of the galaxy , and c13 , a much fainter component located @xmath5 from c12 at p.a .",
    "the two sources could be identified by the wavedetect algorithm when the binning factor were set to be either 2 or 4 , suggesting that they were genuine detections .",
    "images of the central @xmath35 of the _ chandra _  hrc - i image of ic342 are shown in figure  [ f : central_xray ] , together with the positions of the two nuclear sources c12 and c13 , and the x - ray flux contours .",
    "details of the x - ray emission morphology will be discussed in section  [ ss : xrayimage ] .",
    "we extracted the integrated counts of the 23 detected x - ray sources of ic342 using the ciao tool dmextract , and listed the results in table  [ t : sourcelist ] .",
    "the source regions were defined in ds9 using circular apertures with different radii based on the relative brightness of the source compared to the local background and their off - axis angles .",
    "all the background regions were extracted using circular annuli centered on individual sources .",
    "the only exception was the nuclear source c12 , in which an elliptical aperture was used because of its extended nature .",
    "moreover , the background regions of the two nuclear sources c12 and c13 ( @xmath5 apart ) had to be modified to avoid overlapping .",
    "we used webpimms to convert the count rates for all detected x - ray sources into unabsorbed 0.0810  kev luminosity by assuming an absorbed power - law model with @xmath36@xmath19 and @xmath20 , adopted from the average parameters derived from spectral fitting of the _ xmm - newton _  data by k03 .",
    "these results are also presented in table  [ t : sourcelist ] .",
    "this set of average parameters was similar to that derived from the same _ xmm - newton _  data set by b03 , with @xmath37@xmath19 and @xmath38 .",
    "the difference in 0.0810 kev luminosities obtained with these two sets of spectral parameters is about 10% , with slightly lower values for the parameters from k03 .    for c12 , b03 and",
    "k03 derived the x - ray flux by fitting the source spectrum with a simple absorbed power - law model ( b03 : @xmath39@xmath19 and @xmath40 ; k03 : @xmath41@xmath19 and @xmath42 ) . for comparison ,",
    "our adopted flux for c12 is smaller by about 40% from the b03 model and about 30% larger than the k03 simple power - law model by using the average the x - ray sources parameters . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the value from k03 , except for table 1 in which we use the average parameters from k03 as described above .",
    "there is a large uncertainty in the distance estimate to ic342 due to the large uncertainty in the amount of dust extinction toward the galactic center along that line - of - sight .",
    "distance estimates of ic342 range from 1.5 to 8 mpc  @xcite .",
    "a distance of 1.8 mpc was assumed in this paper ( corresponding to a scale of @xmath43  87 pc ) , identical to that in boker et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) and k03 , and similar to that ( 2  mpc ) assumed by @xcite . using an elliptical ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 for semiminor and semimajor axis ) integrating window to include all the diffused emission",
    ", we found the stronger central nuclear source c12 has @xmath46 net counts , corresponding to an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath47 ; the weaker source c13 was one of the weakest source detected in our image , with a net count of @xmath48 ( s / n = 3.8 ) , and an unabsorbed luminosity @xmath49 .",
    "one of the main objectives of our study is to obtain accurate positions of x - ray sources near the center of ic342 .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "hrc - i images have nominal 90% and 99% confidence astrometric accuracy of @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively , while the astrometric accuracies of the _ hst _  wfpc2 data is about @xmath52  @xcite . in order to identify optical counterparts of our _ chandra _  x - ray sources in the _ hst _  data , we first registered their positions to the same reference frame for comparison .",
    "we used the usno - b1.0 catalog  @xcite to improve the astrometric accuracies for both the _ chandra _  and _ hst _",
    "the advantage of using this is that proper motions are already included in the catalog , and hence can be corrected for .",
    "the nominal rms accuracy of the usno b1.0 catalog is @xmath53 .",
    "the astrometry of our _ chandra _  image can be improved when one or more x - ray sources are associated with optical or radio sources of known positions .",
    "as seen in figure  [ f : dss ] , one of the brightest sources , c5 , is clearly associated with a bright stellar object within 1@xmath54 in the dss image .",
    "this source was also previously identified to be associated with a star in the _ rosat _  ( source 4 in  @xcite ) and the _ xmm - newton _  observation ( x12 in k03 ) .",
    "the spectrum of x12 is soft and can be fitted with a blackbody model ( @xmath55 = 0.17 kev ) .",
    "b03 determined the x - ray to optical flux ratio @xmath56 of x12 to be @xmath57 - 3 , which was consistent with that expected from a foreground star of @xmath56 @xmath57 - 1 .",
    "b03 and k03 also identified it to be a foreground star . using the usno - b1.0 catalog",
    ", we found that the source c5 was offset by @xmath58 ( ra offset by @xmath59 and dec offset by @xmath60 ) from this foreground star , which was within the expected @xmath61 pointing accuracy of the _ chandra _  data . while there are other x - ray sources which could be associated with point sources in the dss image , their positional offsets are either @xmath62 or their s / n ratios were too low ( @xmath63 ) to make firm registrations with their optical counterparts .",
    "thus we corrected the pointing of the _ chandra _  image using the ciao command wcsupdate by linearly shifting it until c5 and the star coincided .",
    "this astrometric reference was applied to all the sources and their shifted positions were tabulated in table  [ t : sourcelist ] .    the astrometry of the _ hst _",
    "images were corrected using the iraf task ccmap . with many bright stars within the wfpc2 frame",
    ", we could visually identify stars from the catalog in the _ hst _  data products and compare them with the usno - b1.0 catalog to improve the astrometry .",
    "a total of 7 stars were used for astrometric registration for the _ v _ and _ i _ band data , and 3 stars for the h@xmath7 data .",
    "the rms positional errors returned by ccmap were @xmath64 for _ v _ , @xmath65 for _ i _ , and @xmath66 for h@xmath7 .",
    "these registrations are similar to that of our _ chandra _  hrc - i images , hence allowing meaningful spatial comparison of the sources in different wavelengths .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the _ chandra _  hrc - i image ( @xmath67 ) provides an unprecedented detailed look into the x - ray emitting structure of the ic342 galaxy center .",
    "detailed structures of the x - ray emission from the ic342 center are illustrated in figure  [ f : central_xray ] with the central @xmath35 of the _ chandra _  image .",
    "the two nuclear sources , c12 and c13 , are separated from other x - ray sources and stand out from the low diffuse x - ray background .",
    "the brighter source , c12 , was observed to have at least two components .",
    "the first component is the core emission of radius @xmath68 at the center , roughly consistent with that bounded by the x - ray contour line of 1.4 counts .",
    "the second component is the diffuse emission out to a radius of @xmath69 , with an asymmetric extension along the north - south direction .",
    "the spatial extent , derived from the x - ray image at 99.5% linear scale , is @xmath70 in the north - south and @xmath71 in the east - west directions ( 127  pc  @xmath72 82  pc assuming a distance 1.8  mpc ) , resulting in a major - to - minor axis ratio of @xmath73 .",
    "the observed north - south elongation is similar to that observed in the near infrared wavelength by  @xcite , who detected a diffused emission with a major - axis of 110 pc and a high surface brightness source at the center .",
    "the authors interpreted the results as evidence for a small - scale nuclear stellar bar and a central concentration of stars .",
    "we determined the x - ray luminosity of the core and the circumnuclear diffuse regions of c12 by extracting respectively the source counts of the inner @xmath74 region with a circular aperture , and the source counts of an annulus of @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting x - ray luminosities ( assuming the same spectral and distance parameters as listed in section  [ s : anlypho ] ) are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , implying roughly equal flux contributions in x - ray from these two regions .    to analyze the structure of emission from c12 , its radial flux profile was extracted and normalized at the center .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ f : rp ]  ( top - left ) . as a comparison ,",
    "the normalized radial flux profile of the _ chandra _  psf at the location of c12 derived from the _ chandra _  psf simulator , the _ chandra _  ray tracer ( chart ) , is also shown ( _ dash _ ) .",
    "the emission from the core component of c12 at the central @xmath78 is consistent with that from a point source .",
    "however , the diffused emission component at radius @xmath79 does not decrease as steeply as that of the psf .",
    "we also computed the radial flux profile of a point source plus a uniform @xmath80 circular disk at the location of c12 computed from the simulation task marx .",
    "the results ( _ dot - dash _ ) , also shown in figure  [ f : rp ]  ( top - left ) , are generally consistent with that observed for c12 , with a hint of slowly - decreasing surface brightness in the range @xmath81 for c12 .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( k - s test ) was performed to measure the difference between radial profile of c12 and the models .",
    "the k - s test statistics @xmath82 , the maximum vertical deviation between the two curves , is 0.78 ( confidence probability@xmath83 ) for c12 and a point source , and 0.33 ( confidence probability = 6.0% ) for c12 and a point source plus a @xmath69 disk . the surface brightness profiles for selected bright x - ray sources c3 , c6 , and c21 , are also plotted in figure  [ f : rp ] ( top - right ) , [ f : rp ] ( bottom - left ) , and  [ f : rp ] ( bottom - right ) , respectively for comparison .",
    "the k - s statistic @xmath82 of the reference sources c3 , c6 , and c21 are in a much lower range of 0.170.33 ( corresponding to confidence probabilities 2.2%76.0% ) .",
    "these results reinforce the conclusion that the emission from c12 is not consistent with that from a point source ; the x - ray emission of c12 might be due to multiple sources or diffuse emission or a combination of both .",
    "however , we can not conclude whether the emission is consistent with the various components proposed by  @xcite due to the limited resolution of the x - ray data .",
    "the newly detected x - ray source c13 is one of the faintest source in our _ chandra _  observation , with @xmath84 .",
    "we failed to extract the radial profile of c13 , and can not determine whether it is a point source or a diffused source because of insufficient count statistics .",
    "we also could not exclude the possibility that the emission was actually part of the nebulosity of the extended emission component of c12 .",
    "we compared the _ chandra _",
    "image of the galaxy center of ic342 with the optical observations .",
    "the registered positions of the x - ray nuclear sources c12 and c13 are overlaid on the _ hst _  _ v _ band and h@xmath85 images of the central @xmath86 region of the ic342 in figures  [ f : vband ]  ( top ) and  [ f : halpha ]  ( top ) respectively .",
    "the spatial extent of the c12 core emission is also shown by a @xmath74 circle ( _ dash _ ) in the figures .",
    "the _ hst _  _ i _ band image was also analyzed but was found to be similar to the _ v _ data and thus not shown . in the _ hst _",
    "images , there are many star forming regions at the center of ic342 with obscured emissions and bright knots . both _ hst _",
    "images show that the optical emission from the central @xmath87 of ic342 is concentrated in three star clusters aligned in the north - south direction .",
    "the star clusters have also been observed previously in the near - ir co band by  @xcite .",
    "we named the three clusters here as the nuclear star cluster ( nsc ; middle ) , sc1 ( top ) , and sc2 ( bottom ) .",
    "the centroid of c12 lies close to that of the optical maximum of the nsc , with an offset of @xmath33 measured in all the @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and h@xmath7 images .",
    "the observed separations were only slightly larger than the uncertainty of the x - ray bore sight correction of c12 ( @xmath90 ) in our _ chandra _  image .    using the near - ir co band observations , @xcite deduced that the nsc is a relatively young cluster with an age of @xmath91 yrs , and a mass of @xmath92 .",
    "these results favored an instantaneous burst model rather than a constant star formation rate model for the nsc , meaning the dominant stellar population are of the same age as the nsc .",
    "also , nsc could have formed as a result of gas flowing to the nucleus initiated by torques from a nuclear stellar bar .",
    "the h@xmath7 image is consistent with this scenario in that it shows gas spiraling around the nsc ( see figure  [ f : vband ] and  [ f : halpha ] ) .",
    "the x - ray contours are overlaid on the broadband _ v _ and h@xmath7 images of ic342 in figures  [ f : vband ]  ( bottom ) and  [ f : halpha ]  ( bottom ) respectively for a comparison of the diffuse x - ray emission with the detailed structure of the optical galaxy center .",
    "these contour lines encircle the central @xmath93 region of ic342 and its structure is found to generally agree with those observed in the optical wavelengths , despite the lower angular resolution of the x - ray data .",
    "moreover , the x - ray diffused emission is elongated along the north - south axis , which is similar to the alignment of the three optical nuclear star clusters .",
    "these coincidence suggest that the observed x - ray nuclear emission is associated with the ongoing starburst and the three optical star clusters .",
    "however , the newly detected x - ray nuclear source c13 does not coincide with any bright features in the h@xmath7 image , suggesting that it is not associated with the star formation activities at the galaxy center .      for comparisons with the x - ray and optical data",
    ", we also obtained very large array ( vla ) 2 cm ( 15 ghz ) and 6 cm ( 5 ghz ) radio images of ic342 .",
    "the observations and the data reduction procedures have already been described in tsai et al .",
    "these images have spatial resolutions of @xmath94 at 6 cm and @xmath95 at 2 cm , respectively , with a @xmath96 uncertainty in the absolute position of detected sources .",
    "the positions of all the radio sources detected in the 2  cm and 6  cm are marked in figures  [ f : vband ]  ( top ) and  [ f : halpha ]  ( top ) .",
    "the optical images of ic342 presented in @xcite were not astrometrically registered for comparison with the radio images .",

    "thus , we decided to ignore the confusion effect in the _ xmm - newton _  and the _ rosat _  data .",
    "this analysis is the first to study the luminosity of c12 over a long period of time . in the energy range 0.110 kev ,",
    "the observed luminosity of the ic342 nuclear x - ray source c12 varies roughly by a factor of 2 over the 3 observations spanning a period of over 15 years .",
    "the observed variations of the luminosity of c12 is actually the smallest amongst the three x - ray sources investigated .",
    "it is worth noting that the flux uncertainties tabulated in table  [ t : lumtable ] only include photon statistics .",
    "uncertainties in the relative calibration of various x - ray detectors have not been included .",
    "however , previous studies indicate that variations of normalized flux in different x - ray instruments are small , at a level of @xmath110 @xcite , and thus are not expected to account for all the flux variability observed .",

    "the extension seen in the x - ray diffuse emission of c12 is most probably due to starburst activities induced by star clusters and massive stars .",
    "this region also contains radio sources which aligns from northeast to southwest .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , these radio sources could be interpreted as regions which were small clusters that required excitation by individual o star clusters , each with over 5000 o stars ( @xcite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "possible contributors to the x - ray emission from a nuclear starburst include supernovae , o stars , high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , ulxs , and an obscured agn .",
    "using our _ chandra _  x - ray data , we attempted to explain in the following the stellar nature in the nsc .",
    "many previous infrared observations of ic342 @xcite have proposed a starburst scenario for the nuclear region .",
    "the model of the central starburst includes a nuclear star cluster surrounded by a mini spiral arms - ring system on the scale of @xmath112 ( e.g. , fig .  10 in  @xcite ) , as supported by observations of molecular line emissions .",
    "the x - ray image generally agrees with the spatial scales of this model , with the size of the c12 emission @xmath113 is roughly the size of the proposed central ring ( @xmath114 ) , while the mini spiral arms that extend in the north - south direction to @xmath115 would be beyond the spatial extent of c12 ( see figure 1 of  @xcite for a comparison of the optical and @xmath116co  ( 1 - 0 ) infrared emission ) .",
    "this model suggests that most of the star formation occurs in the central ring region rather than along the spiral arms .",
    "our _ chandra _  observation is consistent with this scenario since the x - ray emission is concentrated in the central 100  pc .",
    "this star formation structure is smaller in size compared to those in other starburst galaxies , which have radii of order 1  kpc @xcite .",
    "we could study the starburst properties of ic342 using the results from starburst galaxies and agn survey  @xcite with the far - infrared to soft x - ray luminosity ratio .",
    "the far - infrared flux measured by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( @xmath117 ) at 60  @xmath118 m was @xmath119  jy in the inner r=@xmath120 region of ic342  @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the luminosity of the compact regions in the nucleus was of the order of @xmath121 to the total ir luminosity of ic342 .",
    "therefore we estimated the far - infrared flux in the galaxy center of ic342 to be @xmath122  jy .",
    "we derived the soft ( @xmath123  kev ) x - ray flux of c12 with webpimms using the spectral model and parameters listed in section  [ s : anlypho ] and obtained @xmath124 .",

    "this is in agreement with the value for star formation galaxies , -3.33 ( @xmath126 ) , and slightly smaller than the average value of seyfert 2 galaxies , -2.54 ( @xmath127 )  @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived a model to predict x - ray emission from starbursts using the brackett @xmath128 emission .",
    "the model suggests that the x - ray emission arises from the accretion of material in population i binary systems which are formed together with the ob stars . the total x - ray emission in the starburst is calculated to be @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the observed brackett @xmath128 emission",
    ", @xmath131 is the average x - ray luminosity of binary systems and was assumed to be @xmath132 , and @xmath133 is the number of ob stars per massive binary systems and was assumed to be 500  @xcite .",
    "the brackett @xmath128 emission from the inner 100  pc of ic342 was measured to be @xmath134  @xcite , thus implying a predicted x - ray luminosity from the starburst of @xmath135 .",
    "our observed 0.35 kev x - ray luminosity of c12 is about 20% of this predicted luminosity .",
    "this might suggest that the x - ray emission from the starburst component in c12 was not dominated by population i binary systems as suggested in the  @xcite model .",
    "it might instead be due to thermal emission such as coronal from young stars , supernovae / supernova remnants , and the hot interstellar medium heated by supernovae and stellar winds .",
    "this might suggest that the soft x - ray emission in c12 was due to part of starburst component and some other thermal emission .",
    "we will discuss the possible thermal origin of the diffuse emission from c12 in section  [ ss : other ] .",
    "another possible origin of the core x - ray emission from the galactic center is an agn . using the _ xmm - newton _  data",
    ", b03 proposed that the hard x - ray from c12 could be coming from a hidden agn , although there was no direct evidence to confirm its existence in ic342 .",
    "the starburst - agn connection has been a topic that generated great interests but the exact relationship remains uncertain .",
    "the triggering mechanism for both phenomena could be the interacting or the merging of gas - rich galaxies , which generates fast compression of the available gas in the inner galactic regions , causing both the onset of a major starburst and the fueling of a central black hole , hence raising the agn .",
    "examples of this class of objects include ngc6240  @xcite , ngc4303  @xcite , and ngc1808  @xcite .",
    "one particularly interesting object for comparison is ngc1808 , where a similar core+diffuse x - ray emission morphology was observed .",
    "the extended x - ray emission of the ngc1808 center ( @xmath136850  pc ) is dominated by soft radiation ( @xmath137 1 kev ) , and follows the same orientation as the h@xmath7 and optical - uv emission , suggesting intense star formation in the region .",
    "in contrast to ic342 , two x - ray point sources ( with a separation of @xmath138  pc ) were resolved in the core of ngc1808 .",
    "spectral information from the _ chandra _  acis data showed that they were associated respectively with hot gas emission and hard x - ray emission .",
    "the nuclear location from the 2mass data of ngc1808 was closer to the softer point source ( source s1 in  @xcite ) . furthermore",
    ", both the x - ray spectra of the centers of ic342 and ngc1808 can be modeled with absorbed power - law plus mekal models , and the fe k@xmath7 emission is missing in both spectra .",
    "@xcite compared the ratios of the detected lines such as and in ngc1808 with those observed in m82 and concluded a starburst - agn coexistence in ngc1808 .    with astrometrically corrected x - ray and radio data , we were able to study the radio loudness of the possible agn at the center of ic342 .",
    "as discussed in section  [ ss : radio ] , radio observations of ic342 reveal a group of weak sources within 5@xmath54 radius of the center , with an integrated @xmath139 .",
    "this is slightly lower than the the range of @xmath140 observed from the 48 low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) sampled by @xcite .",
    "a weak radio source , source j , is near the x - ray center source c12 , with @xmath141  mjy , and @xmath142  mjy ( 3-@xmath143 limit ) , while a stronger source , source a , with @xmath144  mjy , and @xmath145  mjy , is @xmath146 away from c12 @xcite .",
    "therefore if we concentrate on the central @xmath147 radius region of ic342 , corresponding to the size of the core component of c12 , then the integrated radio flux in the region would be @xmath148 . together with the hard ( 2   10  kev )",
    "x - ray flux of the c12 core determined from webpimms ( @xmath149 ) , we could determine the radio loudness parameter @xmath150 , as defined by  @xcite , to be @xmath151 .",
    "this value is comparable to the average for seyfert galaxies ( @xmath152 ) as determined from a sample of 51 agn candidates @xcite .",
    "based on the distribution and flux of the radio sources in the nucleus , we could classify that ic342 as a radio - quiet type agn , if there existed one .",
    "radio - quiet agn included liners , seyfert ( 1 and 2 ) galaxies , and qsos  @xcite . assuming the x - ray luminosity of c12 were due entirely to an agn ,",
    "then the hard x - ray luminosity observed @xmath153 would be just below the lower range of other liners observed with _",
    "_ asca _ , and _",
    "chandra _",
    "( in the range @xmath154 ) , but would be low when compared to seyfert 1 galaxies or quasars ( typically @xmath155 ) .",
    "another property to consider is the x - ray flux variability .",
    "as shown in table  [ t : lumtable ] , we observed the ic342 center x - ray flux to have varied by a factor of @xmath156 ( or flux variability amplitude of @xmath157 ) over 15 years in the three observations , which is comparable to the mean long term flux variability amplitude of 68% for type  1 agn and 48% for type  2 agn  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we also notice that the power law index of the x - ray central source determined from the _ xmm - newton _  spectral fit , @xmath102 ( k03 ) , is slightly steeper than the typical value of radio - quiet agn and liners at @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the absorption column density , @xmath159 ( b03 , k03 ) , is much lower than typical agn values of @xmath160 , together with no intrinsic absorption in the x - ray spectral fit .",
    "there was also no sign of the 6.4  kev fe  k@xmath7 line emission , typically an indicator of agn , in the _ xmm - newton _  epic spectrum ( b03 , k03 ) .",
    "however , this line is also absent in a number of starburst galaxies identified as having hidden agn  @xcite and thus we can not exclude the possibility of the presence of an agn in ic342 .",
    "the positional coincidence of the x - ray center with the optical star clusters in ic342 could suggest a scenario of coexistence of the nuclear star cluster and an agn , as discussed by other authors  @xcite .",
    "we attempt to place a lower limit to the black hole mass . assuming that the black hole is accreting at sub - eddington rate",
    ", we could place a lower limit of the black hole mass at the center of ic342 at @xmath161 given the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy @xmath162 as determined by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it had been reported that nuclear star clusters are more massive than the coexisting black holes and their mass ratio @xmath163/@xmath164  @xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath165 , the nuclear star cluster mass as determined by ir data by  @xcite .",
    "another estimate of the black hole mass comes from the @xmath166 relation  @xcite , which had been shown to apply even in the massive star cluster regime  @xcite . using the velocity dispersion measurements for the nuclear star cluster ( @xmath167 km  s@xmath168 , @xcite ) , and the @xmath166 relation of  @xcite , we derived @xmath169 , which is consistent with the limits described above .",
    "based on these calculations , the range of black hole mass is suggestive of an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) .",
    "however , we should not rule out the alternative possibility of an inactive supermassive black hole ( mass @xmath170 ) similar to known seyfert nuclei that the nuclear emission is due to advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ;  @xcite ) . further spectral analysis could help to address whether this is the case .",
    "the spatial extent of the x - ray emission from the nucleus of ic342 could alternatively indicate the presence of populations of stellar objects uniformly distributed throughout the core region .",
    "these objects could be x - ray binaries , ob stars , or supernova remnants . for example",
    ", as pointed out by  @xcite , populations of massive x - ray binaries evolved from high mass stars could be formed in starburst events , and such populations would be consistent with models associated with starbursts . it had been suggested that photoionization from these stars might have accounted for the the enhanced @xmath171 millimeter emission in the central ring of the mini spiral model of ic342 @xcite .    we considered the possibility of multiple unresolved point sources , consisting of a mixture of stars and xrbs in the nuclear star cluster , contributing to the observed x - ray structure at the center of ic342 .",
    "a burst of star formation usually resulted in the production of large number of ob stars @xcite . with the typical x - ray luminosity for o stars @xmath172",
    "@xcite , and the number of o stars in the nucleus of ic342 at @xmath1364000 estimated from the brackett @xmath128 emission  @xcite , we derived the x - ray luminosity from these stars at @xmath173 .",
    "this is less than 0.1% of the total observed x - ray luminosity of c12 .",
    "the more luminous hmxbs , usually associated with young stellar population like o stars , might have also contributed to the observed x - ray emission .",
    "this could be inferred from the ratio of total x - ray luminosity from hmxb ( with @xmath174 ) to the number of o stars , i.e. @xmath175  @xcite . for the nucleus of ic342",
    ", @xmath131 was estimated to be about @xmath176 ( 10%90% of x - ray luminosity of c12 ) , and the corresponding number of x - ray binaries was about 10 as inferred from @xmath130 .",
    "if these o stars and xrbs were uniformly distributed in a region of radius 50 pc ( the central @xmath74 region of c12 ) , the mean separation ( @xmath29 for hmxbs and @xmath177 for o stars ) would be smaller than the spatial resolution of _ chandra _  hrc - i . as a result , a model with 4000 o stars and @xmath178 hmxbs",
    "could account for both the observed morphology and flux of core component of the x - ray emission of c12 .",
    "we also considered whether the diffuse component of c12 could also be explained by the model above .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f : halpha ] , the nucleus contains many regions of star formation , which could be the result of an outflow induced by the stellar winds of the massive stars or x - ray binaries present in the star clusters , as observed in m82 @xcite .",
    "the exact nature of this diffuse emission remains uncertain given the limited amount of x - ray data available .",

    "this paper aimed to study the nature of the x - ray emission in the nucleus of ic342 using high resolution ( @xmath179 ) _ chandra _  hrc - i observation .",
    "the historical ulx at the center of ic342 , x3 , was resolved into 2 sources , namely c12 and c13 , for the first time since the x - ray telescopes prior to _ chandra _  did not have enough spatial resolution .",
