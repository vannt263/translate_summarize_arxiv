    "interest in the spectral properties of strongly coupled electron - phonon systems has increased due to the discovery of a kink in the quasiparticle dispersion  @xcite measured by angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments in cuprate superconductors .",
    "the energy of this kink is characteristic of a specific optical phonon mode .",
    "furthermore , a peculiar isotope - effect , manifesting in a shift of the quasiparticle dispersion at high energy upon oxygen isotope substitution , was recently measured in the high t@xmath2 materials  @xcite , undoubtedly showing that the electron - phonon interaction plays an important role in the spectral properties of cuprates .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction has been investigated in a variety of models  @xcite . although the ground state properties of these models received great attention , less",
    "was paid to the spectral features .",
    "noticeable exceptions include the holstein  @xcite and the frlich  @xcite models which are characterized by a momentum independent or a weakly momentum dependent electron - phonon coupling . however , in many systems , such as cuprates superconductors or organic materials , the electron - phonon coupling is strongly momentum dependent",
    ". this can give rise to distinctive properties of the single particle spectral features , as we will discuss in this paper .",
    "in particular we will consider a sinusoidal dependence of the coupling on the phonon momentum , which is realized in many systems including the ssh coupling in polyacetilens  @xcite and the coupling to the breathing mode in cuprate superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the treatment of a multi - electron system coupled with phonons is an extremely complex and difficult problem . in general , phonons mediate an effective attraction between electrons and consequently the system becomes susceptible to various kinds of instabilities  @xcite , which might have a significant effect on the photoemission spectra .",
    "however , in this paper we investigate the effect of phonons on a single quasiparticle only , thus neglecting electron - electron or electron - hole scattering processes at the fermi surface .",
    "we believe this to be suitable in describing the properties at energy or temperature scales larger than those associated with the ground state instability , e.g.  the normal state of superconductors .",
    "in fact , as different investigations have shown  @xcite , the polaron models , which consist of a single electron interacting with phonons  @xcite , capture much of the physics seen in the arpes experiments on materials with significant electron - phonon interaction  @xcite .",
    "this includes the kink in the quasiparticle dispersion observed at the phonon characteristic frequency .",
    "one expects that the single particle description of the influence of electron - phonon coupling would be valid to describe the photoelectron or inverse photoelectron spectral function in insulators and semiconductors in which the bands are either full or empty .",
    "however things are more complicated for a strongly correlated insulator in which the conductivity gap is a result of electron correlations and the material is an insulator in spite of having a half filled band . in systems described by the hubbard or t - j models the single hole spectral function will be influenced by the interaction with spin fluctuations .",
    "this results in strongly dressed quasiparticles even without the electron - phonon coupling , as calculations employing self consistent born approximation ( scba )  @xcite and exact diagrammatic quantum monte carlo ( qmc )  @xcite shows .",
    "the later calculation also shows that the scba , which neglects all the magnon crossing diagrams , is a good approximation to the quasiparticle mass renormalization and its dispersion .",
    "when the phonons are considered , in the simplest approximation we can neglect all the crossing diagrams involving phonons and magnons and treat the interaction with phonons in a single particle fashion by taking the hole band dispersion as that given by the t - j model calculations .",
    "the approximations involving the polaron models under investigation here are done in this spirit .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the spectral properties of two polaron models : the one - dimensional holstein ( h ) model  @xcite and a one - dimensional version of the breathing model ( b )   in 1d . however in this paper we extend this nomenclature for all the @xmath3 points , even if this is not entirely correct .",
    "] , relevant for cuprates superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling in the h hamiltonian is a constant , thus independent of the phonon momentum .",
    "the b model has a sinusoidal momentum dependent electron - phonon coupling , being small ( large ) for scattering with small ( large ) momentum phonons . in both cases we consider dispersionless optical phonons with frequency @xmath0 .",
    "although for the sake of simplicity our calculations are done in one dimension , the conclusions and the qualitative properties of the spectra are independent of dimensionality .",
    "the difference between the properties of the two models emphasizes the importance of momentum dependent couplings .",
    "the specific momentum dependence of the b bare electron - phonon coupling results in an effective coupling which is an increasing function of the total polaron momentum , such that the small momentum polaron is in the weak coupling regime while the large momentum one is in the strong coupling regime .",
    "this might be germane to the peculiar behavior of the high energy quasiparticle dispersion  @xcite or the temperature dependency of the photoemission linewidth  @xcite in cuprate superconductors .",
    "the method we use in our calculations is the self - consistent born approximation ( scba)@xcite .",
    "although this method is an uncontrolled approximation which neglects electron - phonon vertex corrections in the self - energy calculation , the results at small coupling are in good agreement with numerically exact quantum monte carlo calculations . because the contribution of configurations with an infinite number of phonons is considered , this approximation manages to capture the physics at large momentum , such as the gap and the flattening of the quasiparticle dispersion at the phonon energy  @xcite .",
    "it can easily provide information about excited states and thus determine the polaron spectral properties , unlike most qmc methods  @xcite fit to calculate only the ground state properties .",

    "analogously , for the breathing model the lattice deformation energy is ( see appendix  [ appbreathing ] ) @xmath20 and the dimensionless coupling is hence defined as @xmath21 compared to the holstein case , the lattice deformation energy for the breathing model has an extra factor of @xmath19 as can be seen in eq .",
    "[ eq : eb ] , which results form the fact that the electron interacts with @xmath19 neighboring oscillators .",
    "there are several other definitions for the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling throughout the literature .",

    "although the polaron momentum is close to @xmath111 , thus @xmath112 is small , @xmath113 is large because @xmath114 which connects two points on the fermi surface can be large.,title=\"fig:\",width=124,height=144 ]    the conclusions based on the analysis of self - energy diagrams discussed above implicitly assume that a small @xmath100 implies small @xmath27 , when the polaron momentum @xmath3 is small .",
    "however , as we have shown in the previous section , if the electron dispersion has low energy states separated by large @xmath27 the above assumption is invalid .",
    "thus the effective coupling at small energy is substantially larger and besides there is no significant increase of the effective coupling with polaron momentum or energy .    for example",
    "the strong dependence of the effective coupling on the momentum does not hold in a metallic system with a large fermi surface . to see this",
    ", one can think of the fermi surface as a degenerate ground state for the quasiparticle   relative to fermi surface is presumably not influenced much by the electron hole creation at the fermi surface . ] . unlike the non - degenerate ground state case where the small energy scattering is restricted to small momentum ,",
    "the relevant scatterings in the presence of a fermi surface are restricted to small momentum _ plus _ a vector which connects two points on the fermi surface ( @xmath113 in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] b ) ) .",
    "therefore scatterings with large momentum , for which @xmath43 is large , are relevant .",
    "this makes the effective coupling to be large even at small energy . because now at both low energy and high energy there are relevant large momentum scatterings the dependence of the effective coupling strength on the energy and momentum will be modest .",
    "although dimensionality plays an important role in determining the quantitative polaron properties  @xcite , the main features of the b polaron are a consequence of strong momentum dependence of the bare electron - phonon coupling .",
    "therefore the main conclusions of this study remain valid for 2d or 3d systems as long as the electron - phonon coupling has a similar @xmath27 dependence ( increases with @xmath27 ) .",
    "the particularities of the b polaron discussed in this paper might be relevant for the weakly doped cuprates characterized by very small fermi pockets around the ( @xmath115 ) points in the brillouin zone which makes the situation very similar to the one captured by the polaron model .",
    "the quasiparticles in this system have a four - fold degenerate ground state with the states separated by @xmath116 or @xmath117 vectors  @xcite .",
    "the relevant phonon mode is believed to be the half - breathing one for which the electron - phonon coupling has a strong @xmath27 dependence , being small at small @xmath27 and large at @xmath116 . if for some reasons the scattering between the ( @xmath115 ) points is restricted or if its importance is small because of an additional @xmath3 dependence in the bare electron - phonon coupling @xmath118 the formed polarons will be characterized by a momentum and energy dependent effective coupling .",
    "consequently , this implies interesting energy and temperature dependent properties such as a strongly temperature dependent quasiparticle photoemission linewidth  @xcite .",
    "however , if the scattering between the ( @xmath115 ) states is relevant , the @xmath27 dependence of the coupling will not be very important and presumably a holstein like coupling can be used to describe the physics as well , analogous to the 1d case discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dkink]-f .",
    "in this paper we study the spectral properties of the one - dimensional holstein and breathing polaron models .",
    "while the h model has a momentum independent electron - phonon coupling , the b coupling is a monotonic increasing function of the phonon momentum .",
    "we find the renormalization of the quasiparticle properties at small momentum in the b model weaker than that in the h one for a dimensionless coupling constant defined as the ratio of the lattice deformation energy and the kinetic energy of the electron .",
    "with increasing phonon frequency @xmath0 , the b quasiparticle weight decreases in contrast to the h case where it increases .",
    "the quasiparticle dispersion in the h model displays a kink and a small gap at an excitation energy equal to @xmath0 . on the other hand , the b model dispersion , besides the gap at @xmath0 ,",
    "exhibits another , more pronounced one at energy @xmath1 .",
    "this is due to the following facts : the momentum @xmath27 of the relevant phonons in the scattering process increases with increasing the total polaron momentum and that the b coupling is an increasing function of @xmath27 . as a consequence the renormalization of the b polaron increases with increasing polaron momentum .",
    "however the first fact is dependent on the free electron dispersion and does not hold if it has low energy states separated by large momentum . in that case",
    "the difference between the b and the h polaron becomes less significant .",
    "the specific momentum dependence of the b bare electron - phonon coupling results in an effective coupling which is an increasing function of the total polaron momentum , such that the small momentum polaron properties are weak coupling while the large momentum ones are strong coupling .",
    "this might be relevant for explaining the peculiar behavior of the high energy quasiparticle dispersion  @xcite or the temperature dependency of the photoemission linewidth  @xcite in cuprate superconductors .",
