    "impacts of balls of soft matter could also be an interesting problem : unique phenomena are expected due to a variety of constitutive equations and due to large deformations .",

    "this velocity scale increases with a modulus @xmath14 ( this can be confirmed due to the data collapse via renormalization of velocity by @xmath27 ) .",
    "as mentioned above and as seen from the snapshots at the maximal deformation , modes of deformation seem to change with increase in impact velocity : from ( 1 ) hertz type , to ( 2 ) ellipsoid , and then to ( 3 ) pancake ( see fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "we shall develop a theory based on these observed forms of deformation .",
    "we note in advance that experimental results can be understood by combining only the two limiting regimes ( hertz and pancake ) .",
    "however , we still present the result based on the ellipsoid approximation as reference , which is consistent with the experimental results in the turn - over regime .",
    "we start from scaling arguments for the hertz regime only to reproduce the essential properties of the well - known complete analytical solution .",
    "the arguments are then extended to the other regimes .    in the hertz regime at small impact velocities ,",
    "the elastic energy stored at the maximal deformation can be estimated dimensionally as @xmath44 with @xmath14 being the elastic modulus of the ball ( @xmath45 is defined as in fig.[f1 ] and @xmath46 is the radius of the contact area ) ; a strain field of the order of @xmath47 is localized in a volume of the order of @xmath48 ( the deformation field relaxes out at a distance of the order of @xmath46 from the contact surface because the strain field is governed by the laplace equation ) . due to the geometrical relation @xmath49 with @xmath26 being the radius of the ball , the energy reduces to the well - known form : @xmath50 assumption of the energy conservation between the initial time and the maximally - deformed moment @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the mass of the ball ) leads us to an estimate for the contact time @xmath53 , which results in the well - known relation,@xmath54 where the characteristic scales @xmath27 and @xmath28 given in eqs .",
    "( [ vc ] ) and ( [ tc ] ) have naturally come out as announced .",
    "this implies a moderate increase of the contact time with decrease in velocity . to obtain a non - trivial @xmath55 relation",
    ", we assume that in our `` hertz regime '' the shape is _ a sphere cut out by a plane _ ( see below ) and require the incompressibility condition : the part of the sphere cut out by the substrate is compensated by an increase in radius , i.e. , @xmath56 combined with the previous relation of the energy conservation , we have the relation between impact velocity and deformation in the horizontal direction as mentioned above:@xmath57    in the ellipsoid regime at intermediate velocities , the maximal elastic energy is given by @xmath58 ; a strain field of the order of @xmath59 is distributed within the whole volume of the order of @xmath60 .",
    "note here the relation , @xmath61 , which expresses the condition of volume conservation for small deformation ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "thus , we have@xmath63 the energy conservation , @xmath64 , allows us to obtain an estimate for the contact time and a velocity - radius relation,@xmath65    in the pancake regime at high velocities , where @xmath66 , the maximal energy becomes @xmath67 ( the ideal rubber deformation energy ) , or a linear spring energy@xmath68 noting that , in this case , the contact time might well be estimated not by @xmath69 but by @xmath70 due to an analogy with a spring system (",
    "physically , we can imagine that after a strong impact the vertical velocity is immediately redirected toward the horizontal direction ) , we obtain the same scaling relations with the ellipsoid case ( eqs .",
    "( [ te ] ) and ( [ xe ] ) ) .",
    "the transition between the hertz and the ellipsoid regimes is given by the condition , @xmath71 , which implies @xmath72 . in terms of velocity",
    "this is expressed as @xmath73 ( compare eqs .",
    "( [ th ] ) and ( [ te ] ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition between the ellipsoid and the pancake regimes should be marked by @xmath74 , or @xmath75 . since the transition from hertz to ellipsoid regimes and that from ellipsoid to pancake regimes are predicted to occur at the same velocity at the level of scaling laws , the ellipsoid regime is not expected to manifest itself clearly .",
    "we summarize the above theoretical predictions which agree with experimental observations : ( 1 ) @xmath43 scales as @xmath76 for small velocities but as @xmath77 for large velocities .",
    "( 2 ) the contact time @xmath42 is constant for large impact velocities but below a certain velocity it deviates from the plateau value and increases with velocity decrease following a scaling law , @xmath41 .",
    "typical plateau value @xmath28 for our samples is of the order of a few ms .",
    "it increases with @xmath26 while decreases with @xmath14 .",
    "( 3 ) both @xmath43 and @xmath42 can be divided in the two regimes by a transition velocity @xmath27 .",
    "typical value @xmath27 is of the order of a few m / s and it increases with @xmath14 .",
    "( 4 ) data should be well characterized by reducing size , time , and velocity variables by scales @xmath26 , @xmath28 , and @xmath27 , respectively .    in our hertz regime",
    ", we assumed that the shape is a sphere cut out by a plane and , in addition , we required eq .",
    "( [ eqa ] ) , which is natural at least in the case of water drops where the surface energy is dominant @xcite . as a result",
    ", we have a global strain @xmath35 distributed over the whole volume @xmath60 , in addition to the original local distribution @xmath47 over @xmath48 .",
    "the former extra energy is far smaller than the latter with a small ratio @xmath78 ; this correction does not change the results of our previous analysis .",
    "experimentally , the scaling relation @xmath37 for large velocities is shown and this relation seems to change into another scaling relation with a stronger power below @xmath79 .",
    "another scaling relation @xmath80 for small velocities is also shown while , for larger velocities ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath42 seems to approach a plateau value .",
    "these behaviors of @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be explained by the theory which starts from experimentally observed shapes of balls at the maximal deformation and employes the energy conservation .",
    "this theory also leads to the prediction @xmath81 for small velocities , which seems consistent with experimental data .",
    "experimentally it is difficult to observe a wide plateau region of the contact time predicted by the pancake form and only an asymptotic behavior ( or the ellipsoid behavior ) to this limiting regime is observed .",
    "this is because of ( 1 ) it is practically difficult to achieve such high impact velocities by the present experimental setup and ( 2 ) it is inherently impossible to exceed a certain high impact velocity above which the impact causes irreversible damages to gel balls .",
    "the effect of gravity can be another source of increase in contact time with decrease in impact velocity as might be the case in some bouncing water drops @xcite . in the present case",
    ", however , this possibility seems to be excluded ; the ratio @xmath82 suggests that the gravitational energy @xmath83 becomes important only for @xmath84 , which is outside of our experimental region .",
    "furthermore , if we define the length @xmath85 by @xmath86 , which is a counterpart of the capillary length , this is about @xmath87 m and is well beyond the characteristic length scale @xmath26 ( of the order of cm ) .",
    "this also suggests a weak gravity effect .",
    "these arguments , in turn , suggest that the gravity may play a role for very small deformations , which are not studied here .",
    "the effect of viscosity is possibly more important and will be discussed in detail elsewhere .",
    "in fact , if we closely look at fig . [ f4 ] we find that the behavior of the softest sample with the highest dissipation seems to deviate slightly from the others ( if we removed these points from these plots , the data collapse would be much better ) .",
    "this suggests a possibility that viscous effects become important already for the softest sample .",
    "the characteristic velocity @xmath27 that emerged as the result of the static energy evaluation turned out to coincide with the velocity of the shear wave propagation , at the level of scaling laws . to understand this meaning ,",
