    "it was realized more than fifty years ago by anderson @xcite that disorder can lead to localization of wave functions in quantum systems .",
    "depending on the strength of disorder , three - dimensional wave functions at a given energy are either all delocalized ( metallic phase ) or all localized ( insulator phase ) . in recent years , such anderson transitions have been observed experimentally in various media : localization of bose - einstein condensates into disorder created by laser speckle @xcite , localization of ultrasound in elastic media @xcite , localization of cold atoms in a kicked potential @xcite .",
    "many works have investigated theoretically the properties of quantum disordered systems exactly at the metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of wave functions at the transition point is that they are neither localized nor delocalized .",
    "their localization properties are described by a set of multifractal exponents characterizing the behavior of the wave function moments at different scales .",
    "more precisely , if we consider a wave function @xmath3 belonging to an @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space with components @xmath5 , then the @xmath0th moment of the wave function behaves for large @xmath4 as @xmath6 . if @xmath3 is localized then @xmath7 for all positive @xmath0 , while if the state is delocalized over the whole hilbert space then @xmath8 is the dimension of the system itself .",
    "multifractality is characterized by the fact that @xmath8 is a a nontrivial function of @xmath0 .",
    "understanding the properties of multifractal dimensions has been the subject of intense research in the past few years ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . in order to investigate the mechanisms involved ,",
    "various models have been proposed .",
    "the simplest models where an analogue of the metal - insulator transition can be observed and studied are random hermitian or unitary matrices whose off - diagonal elements @xmath9 decrease as a power of the distance from the diagonal , as @xmath10 where @xmath11 plays the role of a coupling constant ( here @xmath12 , @xmath13 are @xmath14dimensional vectors , where @xmath14 is the space dimension ) .",
    "when @xmath15 , eigenvectors of these matrices are localized ; they are delocalized for @xmath16 .",
    "anderson - like transition occurs in the localization properties of the eigenvectors at @xmath17 , and typically a multifractal behavior is observed @xcite , similar to the anderson model at the point of metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "such ensembles for @xmath17 are often called critical random matrix ensembles .",
    "the main attention in this field was given to the investigation of the ensemble of so - called critical banded random matrices ( crbrm ) @xcite , whose matrix elements @xmath18 are independently distributed gaussian variables with zero mean and variance decreasing away from the main diagonal as in with @xmath19 . other models with similar properties , such as ultrametric critical random matrix ensembles , have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "recently other critical random matrix ensembles , based on lax matrices of classical one - dimensional @xmath4particle integrable systems , were introduced in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the spectrum of such matrices is of intermediate type @xcite , and that the corresponding eigenvectors display multifractal properties @xcite .",
    "most of the analytical results for these critical ensembles are obtained within perturbation series expansions in the regime of strong multifractality where eigenvectors are almost localized , or in the regime of weak multifractality where eigenvectors are almost entirely extended .",
    "nevertheless , a few relations @xcite are believed to be universal and valid for a large ( but not well defined ) class of critical ensembles .",
    "one of the most striking ones involves anomalous fractal dimensions @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 which characterize the departure of multifractal exponents from their value in the delocalized case ( since @xmath22 for extended states ) . in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that these anomalous dimensions have to be symmetric with respect to the axis @xmath23 , namely @xmath24 one of the analytical arguments in favor of this result is the four - loop calculation of @xmath20 within nonlinear @xmath25-model in @xmath26 dimensions @xcite , which manifests symmetry .",
    "recently , it has been argued that this relation holds exactly in models which can be mapped onto nonlinear @xmath25-models @xcite .",
    "this is for instance the case for critical random matrix models in the regime of weak multifractality .",
    "the fact that this symmetry is not always verified is illustrated by the existence of critical systems for which such a symmetry relation does not hold in general @xcite ( see also section [ sec_interm ] ) .",
    "thus the domain of validity of remains unclear .    for general systems ,",
    "the perturbation expansion approach remains the main analytical tool for investigating multifractal dimensions . for systems of the form",
    ", analytical expressions for multifractal dimensions at leading orders of perturbation expansion have been obtained in the domain @xmath27 , both in the strong and weak multifractality regimes @xcite . while the methods used to derive these results are still applicable in the domain @xmath1 in the weak multifractality regime , no perturbation expansion approach has been developed ( to the best of authors knowledge ) in the domain @xmath1 in the strong multifractality case .",
    "therefore direct analytical verification of the symmetry in the regime of small @xmath11 was not yet possible .",
    "the goal of this paper is to derive analytical expressions for the @xmath8 in the domain @xmath1 where previous approaches did break down .",
    "we obtain a perturbative expression for @xmath1 in the regime of strong multifractality , and perform extensive numerical calculations which corroborate our analytical findings .",
    "this enables us to test analytically the correctness of the symmetry relation for several different critical random matrix ensembles .",
    "the main conclusion of the paper is that , at least at leading orders in the perturbation series , the symmetry is fulfilled .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section [ sec_models ]",
    "the models investigated are introduced .",
    "then multifractal dimensions @xmath8 are defined in section [ sec_definition ] .",
    "the perturbation expansion of @xmath8 in the strong multifractality regime for @xmath1 yields a nontrivial result even at lowest order ; the corresponding calculation is done in section [ sec_zero ] . in section [ sec_first ]",
    "the calculation is performed at the next - to - leading order .",
    "this enables to demonstrate the validity of the symmetry relation up to this order for strong multifractality .",
    "together with known results for the weak multifractality regime , this proves that the symmetry holds in both extreme regimes . in order to assess the validity of this relation in general , numerical results are presented for the different models considered in section [ sec_figs ] . in section [ sec_interm ] we present numerical results for a system without perturbation theory expansion , where eigenfunctions display nontrivial multifractal dimensions , but for which the symmetry property is not valid . in section [ sec_toy ] , a toy model related to the above ensembles , and where exact analytical calculation of multifractal dimensions is possible ,",
    "is briefly discussed .",
    "we now introduce the models that we consider in this paper .",
    "four critical random matrix ensembles associated with the lax matrices of classical integrable systems have been introduced in @xcite .",
    "calogero - moser ( cm ) @xmath4particle systems yield three ensembles of @xmath28 hermitian matrices of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 are independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance , and @xmath31 is one of the three following functions @xmath32 with @xmath33 a parameter ( @xmath34 is the kronecker symbol ) .",
    "we denote these ensembles respectively by cm@xmath35 , cm@xmath36 and cm@xmath37 .",
    "the fourth ensemble introduced in @xcite corresponds to the lax matrix of ruijsenaars - schneider ( rs ) system .",
    "it consists of a set of unitary @xmath28 matrices which , up to a simple transformation , reduce to @xmath38 where @xmath39 are independent random phases uniformly distributed between @xmath40 and @xmath41 and @xmath11 is some fixed constant .",
    "a closely related model , introduced in @xcite and investigated in @xcite , corresponds to a family of quantum maps obtained by quantization of a classical map on the torus .",
    "these quantum maps have exactly the form , but with @xmath11 now depending on the matrix size , namely @xmath42 with @xmath43 fixed .",
    "spectral statistics of these ensembles have been shown to be of intermediate type @xcite .",
    "we will also consider the well - studied crbrm ensemble , which is the set of @xmath28 symmetric or hermitian matrices whose elements @xmath18 are independently distributed gaussian variables with zero mean and variance @xmath44^{-1},\\,\\,\\ , m\\neq n. \\label{crbrme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath45 if the matrices considered are real symmetric , or @xmath46 if they are complex hermitian .",
    "we want to investigate multifractality properties of the above ensembles of random matrices .",
    "multifractality manifests itself in a non - trivial scaling of eigenfunction moments .",
    "let @xmath47 be a normalized eigenfunction of the matrix @xmath18 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 mean eigenfunction moments are defined for any real @xmath0 as @xmath50 , where the average is taken over all random variables of the model and over a small window of eigenvalues .",
    "more precisely , we set @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the total mean eigenvalue density @xmath53 multifractal dimensions @xmath8 are defined as the scaling exponents in the large @xmath4 behavior of these moments , @xmath54 in our matrix models , the dimension @xmath14 of the underlying space is 1 , so that anomalous dimensions are given by @xmath55 . both analytical and numerical calculation of these exponents is a difficult task .",
    "indeed , it is so far not possible to have direct access to exact analytical expressions , and numerical calculations require diagonalization of large matrices .",
    "there is however a way to get some insight into analytical expressions by constructing perturbation series for the eigenfunction moments for small or large values of the coupling constant @xcite . for moments of order @xmath0 with @xmath27 , the lowest order of perturbation series at small and large",
    "@xmath11 has a universal dependence on @xmath0 for all critical ensembles considered above . in the regime of weak multifractality",
    ", the unperturbed eigenvectors are delocalized , and at first order @xmath56 where the constant @xmath57 depends on the system .",
    "it is equal to @xmath58 for crbrme , and 0 for cm models , where this regime corresponds to @xmath59 . for rs ensemble",
    ", weak multifractality regime is reached whenever @xmath11 is close to a nonzero integer , and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the integer closest to @xmath11 @xcite .",

    "@xmath52 is the density of states of unperturbed system , which , at that order , is equal to the actual density of states . the constant @xmath66 in can be obtained as the coefficient in front of the logarithmic term @xmath67 the explicit expressions of @xmath66 can be found e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "it is equal to 1 for rs , cm@xmath35 and cm@xmath36 ensembles , @xmath68 for symmetric crbrme , @xmath69 for hermitian crbrme , and @xmath70 $ ] for cm@xmath37 , where @xmath71 $ ] denotes the integer part .    in the weak multifractality case at leading order",
    ", the fact that @xmath8 is linear in @xmath0 ( eq .  ) implies that the symmetry relation holds .",
    "indeed , @xmath72 is automatically symmetric with respect to the substitution @xmath73 . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated analytically that for crbrme and ultrametric ensembles the second order term also obeys this symmetry . in the same paper",
    "the third order term has been calculated numerically for these models and it has been found that it also fulfilled .",
    "results in @xcite suggest that these results extend to all orders of perturbation theory in the weak multifractality regime .",
    "the situation in the strong multifractality limit is less clear , since is valid only when @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to obtain an expression for @xmath8 in this regime when @xmath1 .",
    "we show that it can be derived within the standard perturbation series approach , and yields , for @xmath1 , @xmath74 the existence of a @xmath11-independent term in and its absence in when @xmath27 looks , at first glance , as the necessity of non - analytical contributions .",
    "in fact , as we shall see , the perturbation series is obtained in an even simpler way than the one used to derive .",
    "a remarkable feature of is that it coincides with what would be obtained from assuming that the symmetry holds .",
    "therefore this perturbation theory approach shows that the symmetry is correct at order zero and at order 1 in the coupling constant @xmath11 for all ensembles considered .",
    "let us consider a set of random hermitian matrices of the form @xmath75 where @xmath30 are independent identically distributed random variables distributed according to some probability distribution @xmath76 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements @xmath77 may contain random variables , but all are independent on the @xmath30 .",
    "matrices for cm and crbrm ensemble are obviously of that form .",
    "the case of the rs ensemble will be discussed separately in section [ sectionrs ] .",
    "standard perturbation theory @xcite applied to matrix for @xmath78 yields eigenvalues @xmath79 and eigenfunctions @xmath80 for @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . in the first non - vanishing order , for fixed @xmath83",
    ", we neglect the term in @xmath84 in and get @xmath85 since by assumption the @xmath86 are independent on the @xmath77 and @xmath87 . in order to calculate the averages one has to integrate over random variables",

    "all these ensembles yield the same @xmath95 behavior .",
    "the definition of fractal dimensions then allows us to extract the leading order term for multifractal dimensions in the domain @xmath1 as @xmath103 note that for @xmath27 , the various integrals appearing in the above calculation do not converge .",
    "thus , this usual perturbation theory approach breaks down .",
    "different techniques were used in the case @xmath27 , yielding an expression for @xmath8 given by eq .  .",
    "at order zero this expression gives @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , together with eq .  , these results show that the symmetry relation is fulfilled at order zero of perturbation theory .    in order to assess the correctness of the @xmath104 behavior in the leading - order term in the expressions  , we take as an example the case of the trigonometric calogero - moser model in fig .",

    "to get the first - order correction to the above result one has to take into account the term in @xmath84 in .",

    "we now briefly turn to an example closely related to the above rs ensemble , and where multifractal dimensions can be calculated exactly .",

    "these vectors correspond to column vectors of the matrix for rs ensemble .",
    "namely , @xmath212 , and since @xmath213 is unitary , vectors are normalized by @xmath214 our goal in this section is thus to calculate fractal dimensions of a system whose eigenvectors would be columns of the unitary matrix @xmath213 . as we now show , multifractal dimensions for the vectors coincide with the zero - order term in the perturbation series expansion of multifractal dimensions for eigenvectors of cm , rs and crbrm ensembles in the strong multifractality regime , that is , eqs .   and when @xmath64 .",

    "we considered critical random matrix ensembles whose elements decrease as inverse powers of their distance to the diagonal .",
    "it is known that for such ensembles eigenfunctions have multifractal properties , which are characterized by a nontrivial set of multifractal dimensions @xmath8 .",
    "perturbation theory , which is the main analytical tool to access these multifractal dimensions , was successfully applied before , both in the weak multifractality limit ( large coupling constant ) and in the strong multifractality limit ( small coupling constant ) .",
    "however in the latter case , only the region @xmath27 had been investigated , since the methods used for this region can not be directly applied to the region @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we filled this gap by developing a perturbation theory valid in the region @xmath1 for small coupling constant .",
    "we considered critical random matrix ensembles built from lax pairs of classical integrable @xmath4particle systems , as well as the well - studied critical banded random matrix ensemble .",
    "we derived a perturbation expansion of the moments of eigenfunctions @xmath244 and obtained the leading terms of the perturbation series in @xmath11 for multifractal dimensions , @xmath245 at order zero , @xmath246 and multifractal dimensions are given by a simple but nontrivial term @xmath243 .",
    "the next order is obtained by considering the second - order term of perturbation theory .",
    "higher - order terms can be obtained straightforwardly by the same method .",
    "it turns out that the above formula for @xmath8 at @xmath1 exactly coincides with the expression obtained from @xmath8 for @xmath27 when assuming that a symmetry holds for anomalous dimensions @xmath2 , where @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , our results also prove that this conjectured symmetry relation is valid for the models considered at leading orders of perturbation theory in the strong multifractality regime .",
    "we also performed detailed numerical investigations which indicate that this symmetry property is in fact fulfilled for all coupling constants .",
    "nevertheless , this symmetry is not an intrinsic property of all critical random matrix ensembles .",
    "indeed , by a small modification of one of our models , we constructed an ensemble where numerics clearly show that such a symmetry is absent .",
    "therefore the range of validity of this symmetry relation remains an open problem ( see however the recent paper @xcite ) .",
