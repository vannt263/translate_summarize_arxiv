    "in recent years the role of the transverse momentum of the parton has been more important in the field of the hadron physics since it provides time - odd distribution and fragmentation functions , and makes the single - spin asymmetries ( ssa ) in hadronic processes possible @xcite .",
    "one gluon exchange in the final state interactions ( fsi ) has been understood as a mechanism for generating a transverse single - spin asymmetry @xcite .",
    "this fsi can be effectively taken into account by introducing an appropriate wilson line phase factor in the definition of the distribution functions of quarks in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "it is possible when the distribution functions are functions of the transverse momenta of the partons , as well as the longitudinal momentum fractions .",
    "therefore , including the transverse momentum of the parton into consideration enlarges the realm of the investigation of the nucleon structure .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a simple scalar diquark model was used to demonstrate explicitly that the fsi can indeed give rise to a leading - twist transverse ssa , which emerged from interference between spin dependent amplitudes with different nucleon spin states . in refs . @xcite it was observed that the same overlap integrals between light - cone wavefunctions that describe the anomalous magnetic moment also appear in the expression of the sivers distribution function with an additional factor in the integrand .",
    "since these integrals are the overlaps between light - cone wavefunctions whose orbital angular momenta differ by @xmath4 , the orbital angular momentum of the quark inside the proton is essential for the existence of the sivers asymmetry .    in refs . @xcite the single - spin asymmetries were analyzed in the impact parameter space , in particular , the transverse distortion of parton distributions @xcite was used to develop a physical explanation for the sign of the ssas for transversely polarized targets .",
    "these aspects were illustrated explicitly by using the scalar diquark model in ref .",
    "miller obtained the charge distributions in the impact parameter space for the valence quarks inside nucleon and found that the charge density inside neutron is negative at the center @xcite .",
    "the term ` impact parameter space ' in this paper means that defined in these references .    in this paper",
    "we study the transverse coordinate space of the parton which is the fourier conjugate to the transverse momentum space .",
    "we investigate the charge distributions in the transverse coordinate space of the valence quarks inside proton and neutron , and compare them with those in the impact parameter space @xcite .",
    "we present the results in terms of the scalar diquark model @xcite for simplicity of presentation , however , extending to more general systems is straightforward .",
    "we also show the difference of the charge distributions in the transverse coordinate space and those in the impact parameter space clearly by using an explicit example of scalar diquark model .    for explicit calculations we use the light - cone wavefunctions .",
    "the light - cone ( lc ) fock representation of composite systems such as hadrons in qcd has a number of remarkable properties . because the generators of certain lorentz boosts are kinematical , knowing the wavefunction in one frame allows one to obtain it in any other frame @xcite .",
    "one can construct any electromagnetic , electroweak , or gravitational form factor or local operator product matrix element of a composite or elementary system from the overlap of the lc wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "lc wavefunctions also provide a convenient representation of the generalized parton distributions in terms of overlap integrals @xcite . in this paper we can study the charge distributions in the transverse coordinate space efficiently in the light - cone framework .",
    "we consider a scalar diquark model which is an effective composite system composed of a fermion and a neutral scalar based on the one - loop quantum fluctuations of yukawa theory .",
