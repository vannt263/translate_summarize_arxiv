    "systems of cold atoms are a popular playground for the study of the unconventional states of matter where particle- particle interactions play crucial role and can not be treated as mere perturbation . in this context ,",
    "rydberg atoms are of particular interest , as inter- atomic interactions for them are much stronger than for the atoms in the ground state and interaction strength can be optically tuned .",
    "resonant dipole - dipole interactions of rydberg atoms can generate strongly correlated gases@xcite that exhibit unconventional quantum phases@xcite and can be exploited to simulate unconventional superconductors@xcite and quantum energy transfer phenomena@xcite .",
    "the latter subject is of special interest for the physics of biological systems , where the processes of fluorescent resonant energy transfer are of crucial importance for understanding the mechanisms of certain bio - molecular interactions and photosynthesis @xcite .    at larger distances ,",
    "the interaction between rydberg atoms is dominated by the van der waals potential , that depends strongly on the principal quantum number of the excited electron , while at smaller distances they are more similar to dipole - dipole repulsion . in the region of the crossover between these two regimes",
    "rydberg blockade takes place @xcite .",
    "many body interactions become dramatically enhanced @xcite , which can lead to the formation of solitons@xcite and onset of such phases as super solid @xcite and topological superfluid@xcite . besides fundamental interest",
    ", such systems were also proposed as candidates for realisation of quantum information devices @xcite .",
    "the effective size of a rydberg atom is orders of magnitude bigger than those atoms in the ground state .",
    "consequently , the interaction between them is dominated by the rydberg electron wave function@xcite . when this interaction is attractive macromolecules can be formed@xcite .",
    "besides , the interactions between rydberg atoms and atoms in the ground state can substantially modify the effective interaction between the former , e.g. in the mixture of rydberg atoms and bec which was recently realised experimentally @xcite .",
    "it was shown in this case that a pair of excited rydberg electrons interacting with the ground state particles of a bec of @xmath1 atoms can be bound together by an induced attractive interaction of the yukawa type @xcite .",
    "effects of attraction were also predicted for 2d rydberg excitons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the formation of the bcs state of fermionic electromagnetically dressed rydberg atoms interacting with bec of composite bosons .",
    "the examples can include the systems consisting of fermionic atoms such as @xmath0 or @xmath2 , for which at low temperatures the atoms in the ground state form bec of diatomic molecules and rydberg atoms can be created by coupling with external laser field . using random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    "we calculate the effective interaction between dressed rydberg atoms accounting for the rydberg - rydberg , rydberg - bec and inter- bec interactions .",
    "we show that although strong repulsive van der waals interaction between rydberg atoms is present , they can undergo a transition to the bcs - state due to the exchange of the virtual bogoliubov excitations of the condensate @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the critical parameters of the system can be controlled optically by changing the detuning of the excitation . for the particular detuning",
    ", we solve the gap equation and show that the rydberg - dressed bcs - state could be observable in the realistic system .",
    "let us consider a bec of composite bosons e.g. ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) , where an optical field couples the ground and rydberg electronic states , with rabi frequency @xmath5 and detuning @xmath6 .",
    "for an off - resonant excitation when @xmath7 a small fraction of the atoms in the ground state will be transferred into dressed rydberg state @xcite which represents quantum superposition of the ground and highly excited states ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the dressed states have much longer lifetimes than the bare rydberg states , which allows the system to reach thermodynamic equilibrium@xcite .",
    "it can be thus described using a model of a diluted gas of fermionic rydberg - dressed atoms interacting with bec of diatomic molecules , and represents particular example of bose- fermi mixture .    in this section using diagrammatic techniques we perform calculation of the effective many body interaction potential between the rydberg dressed atoms accounting for their van der waals repulsion and the interaction with molecules forming the bec .",
    "let us start our discussion by presenting the bare interactions present in the system .     dimers . ]",
    "\\a ) _ interaction between rydberg - dressed atoms _ .    at long distances ,",
    "the bare interaction between rydberg atoms is dominated by the van der waals repulsion . for a dressed atom ,",
    "the rydberg component is proportional to @xmath8 and in the regime of large inter- atomic separations the interaction is equal to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the atom - dependent dispersion coefficient@xcite . for smaller distances when inter- atomic separation becomes comparable to the the rydberg blockade radius",
    "@xmath11 the form of the interaction changes @xcite and with good precision it can be approximated as @xcite : @xmath12    in our further discussion we consider the regime where @xmath13 , that corresponds to the repulsive scattering channel characteristic for @xmath14 excitations @xcite .",
    "\\b ) _ interaction between rydberg - dressed atoms and particles in the bec .",
    "_    to estimate the interaction between rydberg atoms and diatomic molecules forming bec we follow the approach proposed by fermi according to which the interaction between the rydberg and ground state atoms is dominated by the scattering of the rydberg electrons and particles of bec .",
    "the latter can be approximated as@xcite ,    @xmath15    where we accounted for the fact that in a rydberg dressed state the weight of the rydberg component is equal to @xmath8 . in the above expression",
    "@xmath16a_0 $ ] is the energy dependent s - wave scattering length @xcite where @xmath17 stands for the electric dipole polarizability , @xmath18 for the bohr radius and @xmath19 is the zero - energy scattering length .",
    "@xmath20 is the p - wave scattering length and @xmath21 is the e - rydberg wave function given by@xcite ,    @xmath22        with @xmath23 and @xmath24 standing for the principal quantum number ( with quantum defects ) and angular momentum respectively .",
    "\\c ) _ interaction between particles in the bec .",
    "_    as mention before , we consider a bec formed by diatomic molecules .",
    "the interaction between them is repulsive and in the real space can be approximated by zero range potential given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is dirac delta function ; @xmath27 is the molecular scattering length , that is estimated as 0.6 times the atomic scattering length@xcite .",
    "the mass of the diatomic molecule @xmath28 , with @xmath29 equal to the mass of a single fermionic atom .    in the rest of this section",
    "we calculate the effective interaction between rydberg dressed atoms accounting for all the processes mentioned above . in frameworks of rpa",
    "it can be expressed in form of the infinite series of feynman diagrams corresponding to the multiple scattering processes as shown at the fig.2 .",
    "the physical meaning of the diagrams is transparent : the first term corresponds to the direct van der waals repulsion between rydberg dressed atom , the second one to the second order process in the fermi sea of the rydberg atoms with virtual excitation of the particle- hole pair ( those kind of processes lead e.g. to the screening of the interaction in coulomb plasmas ) , the third term to the exchange of a bogoliubov excitation of the bec between rydberg atoms ( these terms lead to the bcs pairing ) , the rest correspond to the higher order processes .",
    "summation of the infinite series performed in the refs .",
    "[ ] gives the following result :    @xmath30+\\pi_2(q,\\omega)v_{12}^2(q)}{[1-\\pi_1(q,\\omega)v_{11}(q)][1-\\pi_2(q,\\omega)v_{22}(q)]-\\pi_1(q,\\omega)\\pi_2(q,\\omega)v_{12}^2(q)}.\\ ] ]    note that the frequency dependence of @xmath31 implies that effective interaction between rydberg atoms accounts for the effects of the retardation which are of crucial importance in the conventional mechanism of superconductivity when the bcs pairing occurs due to the exchange of acoustic phonons .",
    "in our case the role of the phonons is played by bogoliubov excitations of the condensate .    in the eq.[veffb ] the potentials @xmath32 represent the fourier transforms of the potentials @xmath33 defined above .",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35/z$ ] , @xmath36 as for @xmath37 , it can be calculated only numerically .",
    "the quantities @xmath38 stand for polarization operators of fermi and bose subsystems .    for the rydberg dressed atoms it is given by@xcite ,    @xmath39    where @xmath40ln\\left|\\frac{x+x^2-x_0}{x - x^2+x_0}\\right|\\ ] ] with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 being the fermi energy and fermi wave vector of the dressed rydberg gas respectively ( @xmath45 stands for the density of the molecules in the bec such that the rydberg atom density is @xmath46 ) .",
    "@xmath47 is the density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "the polarization operator for the dimers in the bec is given by @xmath48 with a molecular dispersion equal to , @xmath49 .    in fig.3",
    ", we show the result of the calculation of the effective interaction between rydberg atoms given by eq.([veffb ] ) for the case of @xmath0 atoms with repulsive van der waals interactions , @xmath13 .",
    "we plot @xmath50 evaluated at @xmath51 for different laser detuning .",
    "it can be clearly seen that for certain parameters the effective interaction becomes attractive at low frequencies ( see fig.3(b ) ) . in fig.3(c ) we show how the strength of the attraction can be controlled optically by changing of the laser detuning ; the white area in the lower left side corresponds to a threshold where infrared divergencies appear , beyond this point the effective potential becomes repulsive .    .",
    "the inset shows the gap at @xmath52 as function of the temperature.,height=124 ]    the appearance of the region of the attractive potentials at small @xmath53 for @xmath54 suggests that bcs pairing between rydberg atoms becomes probable . to analyse this effect quantitatively ,",
    "we solve superconducting gap equation in frequency domain . for this purpose",
    "we introduce @xmath55-averaged effective interaction potential @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 , is exchanged momenta between a pair of rydberg - dressed atoms and the normalisation constant is @xmath58 .",
    "the integral has first order poles that can be worked out analytically @xcite .",
    "the resulting potential is shown at fig.4(a ) .",
    "it is attractive at small frequencies which correspond to long retardation times as it is required for the formation of bcs state . to define the value of the critical temperature we solved numerically the gap equation@xcite , @xmath59}{2e}d\\omega',\\ ] ] where @xmath60 .",
    "the results are shown at fig.[fig4](b ) where the dependence @xmath61 is plotted for @xmath62 .",
    "the inset shows the collapse of the energy gap at the critical temperature @xmath63 .",
    "the size of the cooper pair can be estimated as @xmath64 , while the inter particle average distance for the dressed atoms is equal to @xmath65 .",
    "for the parameters used in fig.4 with a blockade radius equal to @xmath66 , we have that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "finally , it is important to mention that the effective interactions between the atoms in the bec might also be affected for the weak coupling with the rydberg states ; as studied previously@xcite a roton minima can appear in the ground state atom s dispersion leading to instabilities in the bec .",
    "this effect might impose further restrictions for the values of the parameters suitable for the observation of the bcs state of rydberg dressed atoms .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that despite the van der waals interaction between the rydberg - dressed atoms is repulsive , the total effective interaction potential in the system consisting of dressed rydberg atoms and bec of diatomic molecules can become attractive .",
    "the attraction is provided by the virtual exchange of the excitation of the condensate and can lead to the formation of the bcs state .",
