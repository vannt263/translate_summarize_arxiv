    "for the solution of large stiff problems of the type@xmath0where @xmath1 arises from the discretization of unbounded sectorial operators and @xmath2 is a nonlinear function , in recent years much work has been done on the construction of exponential integrators that might represent a promising alternative to classical solvers ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite for a comprehensive survey ) . as well known the computation of the matrix exponential or related functions of matrices is at the core of this kind of integrators .",
    "the main idea is to damp the stiffness of the problem ( assumed to be contained in @xmath3 ) on these computations so that the integrator can be explicit .    under the hypothesis",
    "that the functions of matrices involved are exactly evaluated , the linear stability can be trivially achieved for both runge - kutta and multistep based exponential integrators and hence highly accurate and stable integrators can be constructed . on the other hand ,",
    "the main problem with this class of integrators is just the efficient computation of such functions of matrices , so that , very few reliable codes have been written ( we remember the rosenbrock type exponential integrators presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason many authors are still doubtful about the potential of exponential integrators with respect to classical implicit solvers even for semilinear problem of type ( [ pr ] ) .",
    "an exponential integrator requires at each time step the evaluation of a certain number ( depending on the accuracy ) of functions of matrices of the type @xmath4 , where    @xmath5    being @xmath6 the time step .",
    "actually this represents the general situation for the exponential time differencing methods , that is , the methods based on the variation - of - constants formula ; for lawson s type method ( also called integrating factor methods ) only the matrix exponential is involved .",
    "we refer again to @xcite and the reference therein for a background .    among the existing techniques for the computation of functions of matrices",
    "( we quote here the recent book of higham @xcite for a survey ) , in this context the restricted - denominator ( rd ) rational arnoldi algorithm introduced independently in @xcite and @xcite for the computation of the matrix exponential seems to be an reliable approach .",
    "it is based on the use of the so called rd rational forms , studied in @xcite for the exponential function , @xmath7where @xmath8 is a polynomial of degree @xmath9 we refer again to morno for the basic references about the properties and the use of such rational forms . while in the matrix case , the use of these approximants requires the solution of linear systems with the matrix @xmath10 , as shown in @xcite in the context of the solution of ( [ pr ] ) when @xmath3 is sectorial so typically sparse and well structured this linear algebra drawback can be almost completely overtaken organizing suitably the step - size control strategy and exploiting the properties of the rd arnoldi method concerning the choice of the parameter @xmath11 . in other words the number of linear systems to be solved can be drastically reduced with respect to the total number of computations of functions of matrices required by the integrator .",
    "therefore the mesh independence property of the method , that leads to a very fast convergence with respect to a standard polynomial approach ( see again @xcite ) , can be fully exploited for the construction of competitive integrators .",
    "a problem still open is that inside the integrator the rational arnoldi algorithm ( responsible for most of the computational cost ) have to be supported by a robust and sharp error estimator . in the self - adjoint case",
    "the problem has been treated in @xcite where the author presents effective a - posteriori error estimates , even in absence of information on the location of the spectrum of @xmath3 .",
    "anyway , in the general case , when ( pr ) arises for instance from the discretization of parabolic problems with advection terms and/or non - zero boundary conditions the numerical range of @xmath12 , that we denote by @xmath13 , may not reduce to a line segment . in this sense",
    "the basic aim of this paper is to fill this gap providing error estimates for the non - symmetric case using as few as possible information about the location of @xmath13 .",
    "it is necessary to keep in mind that a competitive code for ( [ pr ] ) should also be able to update @xmath3 ( interpreted as the jacobian of @xmath14 , @xcite , @xcite ) so that @xmath13 is may be not fixed during the integration , and so it is important to reduce as much as possible any pre - processing technique to estimate @xmath13 .",
    "in particular assuming that @xmath15we shall provide a - posteriori error estimates for the rd arnoldi process using only information about the angle of the sector containing @xmath13 , angle that is typically independent of the sharpness of the discretization and hence computable working in small dimension .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the basic idea of the rd rational arnoldi method and in section 3 we derive some first general error bounds based on the standard approaches . in section 4 , exploiting the relation between the derivatives of the function @xmath16 and the laguerre polynomials extended to the complex plane , we derive some a - posteriori error bounds .",
    "the problem of defining reliable a - priori bounds is investigated in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the analysis of the generalized residual as error estimator , that can be used to obtain information about the choice of the parameter @xmath11 for the rational approximation . in section 7",
    "we present some numerical examples arising from the discretization of a one - dimensional advection - diffusion model . in section 8",
    "we provide some hints about the use of the rd rational arnoldi method inside an exponential integrator with the aim of reducing as much as possible the number of implicit computations of @xmath17 .",
    "finally , in section 9 we furnish a deeper analysis concerning the fast rate of convergence of the method , that will provide further information about the optimal choice of the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "in what follows we denote by @xmath18 the euclidean vector norm and its induced matrix norm . as already mentioned , the notation @xmath19 indicates the _ numerical range _ of @xmath3 , that is , @xmath20while the spectrum of @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath21 . the notation @xmath22 indicates the space of the algebraic polynomials of degree @xmath23 .    given @xmath24 ,",

    "the rd rational approach seeks for approximations to @xmath36 of the type @xmath37where @xmath38 is a suitable parameter .",
    "turning to the matrix case , @xmath39 is approximated by elements of the krylov subspaces    @xmath40    with respect to @xmath41 and the matrix @xmath42 defined by the transform @xmath43 in this sense the idea is to use a polynomial method to compute @xmath44 , where@xmath45is singular at @xmath26 .",
    "for the construction of the subspaces @xmath46 we employ the classical arnoldi method .",

    "this technique has been introduced independently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "anyway , the idea of using rational krylov approximations to matrix functions was originally introduced in @xcite .",
    "more recently this approach has been extended to the case of multiple poles and is commonly referred to as rks ( rational krylov subspace ) approximation ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

[ rem1]in order to provide information about the geometry of @xmath65 , it is worth referring to  @xcite theorem 5.2 in which the author proves that if @xmath3 is an invertible matrix then@xmath96taking @xmath97 , we have that for small values of @xmath11@xmath98    going back to our method , the corresponding error @xmath99 can be expressed and bounded in many ways ( we quote here the recent papers @xcite and @xcite for a background on the error estimates for both polynomial and rational arnoldi approximation to matrix functions ) .",

    "we consider the behavior of the method for @xmath208 , @xmath322 and @xmath323 .",
    "the robustness of the method with respect to the choice of @xmath208 is maybe the most important aspect concerning its use inside an exponential integrator .",
    "we want to give here some practical suggestions assuming to use a sparse factorization technique to solve the linear systems with @xmath324 , that , computationally , has to be considered the heaviest part of the method .    1 .",
    "working in much smaller dimension compute @xmath27 and use the generalized residual to estimate the initial @xmath287 .",
    "2 .   for nonlinear problems , interpreting @xmath3 as the jacobian of the system ( @xcite , @xcite ) , it is necessary to introduce some strategies in order to reduce as much as possible the number of updates of @xmath3 during the integration , since each update would also require to update the factorization . as for exponential w - method ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , we suggest , whenever it is possible , to work with a time - lagged jacobian and hence to introduce the necessary order conditions in order to preserve the theoretical order .",
    "3 .   using a quasi - constant step - size strategy ( without jacobian update ) allows to keep the factorization of @xmath325 constant for a certain number of steps . whenever it is necessary to update the stepsize @xmath326 without changing the jacobian , if we want to keep the previous factorization of @xmath327 we just need to consider the ratio @xmath328 . if ( indicatively ) it is bigger than @xmath329 or smaller than @xmath330 ( cf . figure 4 and 5 ) , where @xmath287 arises from a previous analysis of the generalized residual , then we need to update the factorization ( cf . again",
    "@xcite ) , otherwise we can keep the previous one . in this phase , however , one can even considers other strategies to define suitably the window of admissible values of @xmath208 around @xmath287 , taking into account of the local accuracy required by the integrator , the norm of @xmath41 , etc .",
    "looking carefully at figure 5 we notice that while the analysis in smaller dimension suggested to take @xmath278 for reaching the desired tolerance in exactly @xmath331 iterations the method is unexpectedly a bit faster taking @xmath332 ( second picture ) .",
    "the analysis was correct because in larger dimension the method actually achieves the tolerance in @xmath333 iterations ( first picture ) . in order to understand the reason of this behavior , we need to remember that the definition of @xmath334 given at the end of section 4 was based on the assumption that @xmath335 is independent of @xmath336 but this is not true . in what follows we try to provide a more accurate analysis studying the decay of @xmath221 .",
    "we denote by @xmath337 , @xmath338 , the singular values of @xmath42 .",
    "moreover we denote by @xmath339 , @xmath338 the eigenvalues of @xmath42 and assume that @xmath340 for @xmath338 .",

    "we remark moreover that an almost equal bound has been obtained in @xcite studying the convergence of the smallest ritz value of the lanczos process for self - adjoint compact operators .    in practice",
    ", the use of ( [ bn ] ) requires the knowledge of @xmath347 and a bound for @xmath348 , that is , information about the singular values of the operator @xmath349 . as a model problem",
    "we consider again the operator @xmath3 defined by ( lu ) with @xmath295 , whose eigenvalues are @xmath350 , @xmath338 , so that the eigenvalues of @xmath42 are given by @xmath351 . in this case",
    "( [ psum ] ) holds for @xmath352 so that @xmath42 can be referred to as a _ trace class _ operator ( see again @xcite ) .",
    "hence , taking for instance @xmath353 we have@xmath354and so@xmath355the bound ( [ pmh ] ) reveals that the rate of decay depends on the choice of @xmath11 and then on @xmath6 . for large values of @xmath11 ,",
    "say @xmath356 , the bound ( [ tb ] ) can be heavily improved exploiting the properties of the @xmath357 function and the convergence is extremely fast .",
    "the following proposition states a general superlinear bound that can be used when @xmath3 is an elliptic differential operator of the second order , so with singular values growing like @xmath358 .",
    "the proof is straightforward since we just require to bound @xmath359 , and apply ( [ bn ] ) with @xmath353 .",
    "let @xmath3 be an elliptic differential operator of the second order .",

    "formula ( [ hh ] ) is almost useless since too much information on @xmath3 would be required . on the other side ,",
    "it is fundamental to understand the dependence on @xmath11 .",
    "setting as usual @xmath364 and putting the corresponding bound ( [ hh ] ) in theorem [ pro1 ] ( formula ( [ fe2 ] ) ) , we easily find that the theoretical optimal value for @xmath208 is obtained seeking for the minimum of@xmath365with respect to @xmath208 , that is,@xmath366this new value , less than @xmath367 , explains our considerations about figure 5 given at the beginning of this section .",
    "we need to point out that since the choice of @xmath287 is independent of @xmath360 and @xmath6 , formula ( [ hh ] ) is quite coarse for small values of @xmath6 and not able to catch the fast decay of @xmath221 . in any case , if an estimate of @xmath360 is available an a - priori bound for the rd arnoldi method can be obtained taking@xmath368(cf .",

    "in this paper we have tried to provide all the necessary information to employ the rd arnoldi method as a tool for solving parabolic problems with exponential integrators . the little number of codes available in literature , and consequently , the little number of comparisons with classical solvers is a source of skepticism about the practical usefulness of this kind of integrators . indeed , with respect to the most powerful classical methods for stiff problems , the computation of a large number of matrix functions , generally performed with a polynomial method , is still representing a drawback because of the computational cost .",
    "the use of polynomial methods for these computations may even be considered inadequate whenever we assume to work with an arbitrarily sharp discretization of the operator , since this would result in a problem of polynomial approximation in arbitrarily large domains . for these reasons , the use of rational approximations as the one here presented ,",
    "should be considered a valid alternative because of the fast rate of convergence and the mesh independence property , provided that we are able to exploit suitably the robustness of the method with respect to the choice of the poles , as explained in section 8 for our case"
