    "gravitational lensing by galaxies is of interest both because it provides constraints on the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy , and because it allows the study of galaxies at higher redshifts than would otherwise be possible because of the magnification of the lensed object .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has proven to be very useful for gravitational lensing studies because of its ability to obtain high resolution images of faint objects .",
    "this utility has been demonstrated both by studies of previously identified lensing candidates ( e.g.  fsc 10214 + 4724 , eisenhardt et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the discovery of new candidate lenses ( e.g. ratnatunga et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the hst images of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) provide a rich ground for gravitational lens searches because of the combination of deep exposures in multiple colors and the high spatial resolution of the hst ( williams et al .",
    "a visual inspection of the field reveals several possible candidate lensing systems ( e.g.  hogg et al .",
    "these include a configuration of four compact galaxies with similar blue colors , separated by @xmath8 ( j123641 + 621204 , or in our notation l4.1 ) , a red `` elliptical '' with a blue `` arc '' offset by about @xmath4 to the southwest and a potential counterimage on the other side ( j123652 + 621227 , or l3.1 ) , and a red `` elliptical '' with a blue `` arc '' offset by about @xmath7 to the south ( j123656 + 621221 , or l3.2 ) .",
    "spectroscopy of the constituent objects is critical for determining the nature of these candidate gravitational lens systems .",
    "therefore , as part of a modest program of spectroscopy of galaxies in the hdf , we used the keck telescope to obtain low - resolution spectra of objects in these candidate lenses with the aim of determining their redshifts and spectral characteristics .",
    "the observations themselves are described in @xmath9 2 , the results of the analysis of the data in @xmath9 3 , and the implications of these results are discussed in @xmath9 4 .",
    "spectra of objects in the hdf were obtained on 1996 march 15 ( ut ) with the keck 10-m telescope and the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris , oke et al .",
    "the lris slit - mask facility allowed us to obtain spectra of many objects simultaneously .",
    "we designed two slitmasks , each of which contained about 20 objects in the hdf itself and its flanking fields .",
    "the slitlets were @xmath10 wide .",
    "the spectra were obtained using the 300 l / mm grating , which provided wavelength coverage from about 5000  through 9500 with the exact coverage dependent on the location of the slitlet , and with declining sensitivity at the red end of this range . with the 24@xmath11 m pixels of the tektronix ccd ,",
    "the wavelength scale is approximately 2.4@xmath12pixel and the spatial scale is @xmath13pixel .    in selecting our objects",
    ", we specifically targeted the three sets of objects in the hdf which we found to be the most likely lensed systems .",
    "true - color images of these sets of objects and the orientation of our slit positions is shown in figure 1 ( plate 1 ) .",
    "the positions , magnitudes , and colors of the objects in these candidate lens systems are given in table 1 .",
    "the position angles of the two masks were chosen so that the slitlets passed through both the candidate lens and lensed object for the two systems in which both are identifiable .",
    "this corresponds to a position angle of @xmath14 ( pa19 ) for l3.2 and @xmath15 ( pa61 ) for l3.1 .",
    "a slitlet was placed across the system of four similar objects ( l4.1 ) at both position angles .",
    "our observations consist of 80 minutes of integration time with the pa61 mask and 60 minutes for the pa19 mask , each of which was divided into two exposures . from images taken during the alignment procedure",
    ", we estimate the seeing was about @xmath7 .",
    "the reduction of these data is described in detail in moustakas et al .",
    "briefly , after standard ccd reduction techniques , the two exposures were combined using bad pixel maps to eliminate cosmic rays .",
    "the combined image was checked by eye for the few cosmic rays which escaped detection in the first pass .",
    "the combined image was then transformed to linear wavelength scale using arc lamps observed after each exposure .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were then extracted from the two - dimensional data .",
    "the location on the slitlet of each extraction was based on the observed location of flux . in all cases",
    ", this corresponds to the expected location of a target object .",
    "the one - dimensional spectrum was smoothed with a gaussian of @xmath16 , which is the approximate instrumental resolution .",
    "no further smoothing was performed .",
    "a relative flux calibration of the spectra was made using a spectrophotometric standard observed with lris in long - slit mode on an earlier observing run with a very similar setup ( kindly provided by h. spinrad and d. stern ) .",
    "although this is clearly far from ideal for flux calibration , the result is consistent with a previously obtained spectrum of one of our targets .",
    "the resulting one - dimensional spectra are described in detail in the following section .",
    "the extracted spectra of this set of objects are shown in figure 2 , along with a spectrum obtained for the same objects with a wider slit by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter sgda ) .",
    "this figure indicates that our spectra confirm sgda s general identification of ly@xmath3 emission at @xmath17 , and possibly their identification of siiv absorption at the same redshift .",
    "this redshift is consistent with the colors of the objects given in table 1 , as the redshifted lyman break provides a natural explanation for the very red f300w @xmath18 f450w color .",
    "in fact , the objects were selected by sgda to be candidate @xmath19 galaxies on the basis of their colors",
    ".    a closer look at our spectra shows that at both of our position angles , the emission lines have two distinct components .",
    "based on ly@xmath3 , the redshifts of these components are @xmath20 and @xmath0 , corresponding to a rest frame velocity difference of 800 @xmath21 . moreover , our two - dimensional spectra indicate that the different velocity components are at different spatial locations .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 ( plate 2 ) , in which the ly@xmath3 lines are at the same location or only slightly offset along the slit for pa61 , but are separated by several pixels for pa19 .",
    "a correlation between velocity and position had been tentatively suggested by sgda .",
    "_ the detection of a different spatial location for the different velocity components rules out gravitational lensing as the cause of this compact configuration of high redshift objects_.    with our two position angles , we can attempt to identify which of the four objects is responsible for each feature . because the emission lines are at roughly the same position on the pa61 slitlet , the likely candidates are the northern and southern objects , as these are the only two at roughly the same position along the slit at this angle .",
    "this tentative identification appears to be confirmed by the offset observed on the pa19 slitlet , which is exactly that expected if the two emission components are from these two objects .",
    "however , as a caution we note the seeing was only marginal for resolving this system , and a firm identification of individual spatial components with velocity components awaits spectral data with better spatial information .",
    "we also note that both redshift components appear to have nv emission which is strong relative to ly@xmath3 , and which is redshifted compared to its expected location given the @xmath22 determined from ly@xmath3 .",
    "strong nv emission is also present in sgda s spectrum , as is the offset of the peak emission to slightly higher redshift than that of the corresponding ly@xmath3 feature .",
    "the relative strength of the high ionization nv line is suggestive of an agn ( e.g.  kinney et al . 1993 ) .",
    "however , the redward peak of the nv feature and the possible evidence for some p - cygni absorption blueward of the expected line center suggest that there may also be a massive star component to the nv emission . therefore , this system appears to be composed of two or more star - forming galaxies , possibly with agn , separated by roughly 10 kpc and 800 @xmath21 .      from west to east ,",
    "our slitlet for this system crossed the `` arc '' , the central `` elliptical '' and then the `` counterimage '' ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "an emission line at @xmath23 at the position of the counterimage is the only emission feature detected along this slitlet . a one - dimensional spectrum extracted at the position of the counterimage",
    "is shown in figure 4 . the two - dimensional spectrum in the wavelength region around the detected emission line is shown in figure 3 ( plate 2 ) .",
    "the emission feature is visible on each separate exposure .",
    "a faint red continuum at the position of the elliptical can be seen on the two - dimensional spectrum , but the signal is insufficient for any analysis .",
    "an even weaker blue continuum is visible on the two - dimensional image at the position of the arc .",
    "most importantly , no emission line is seen in the arc spectrum in the range from @xmath24  to @xmath25 .    the presence of an emission line at the position of the counterimage and the absence of any corresponding line at the position of the arc is evidence against a lensing origin for this system . however , the emission feature is not overwhelmingly strong , so it is interesting to consider other data .",
    "the colors of the objects given in table 1 provide independent evidence that the arc feature and counterimage are not lensed images of a single object .",
    "specifically , the counterimage has a significantly bluer f450w@xmath18f606w color than the arc .",
    "although slightly different colors are possible for different arc features ( hogg et al .  1996 ) , the combination of the colors and our spectral data favor the more straightforward interpretation that the arc and counterimage are different galaxies .",
    "the colors can also help in the identification of the single emission line of the counterimage .",
    "the colors show that the counterimage has a flat spectrum from f814w through f450w , and then probably reddens into the f300w bandpass .",
    "the flat spectral shape is characteristic of the star - forming galaxies , and the red f300w@xmath18f450w color , if real , suggests that @xmath26 , as a result of the lyman break redshifting through the f300w bandpass ( e.g.  sdga ) .",
    "unfortunately , the faintness of the counterimage means that the absence of a detection only requires f300w@xmath18f450w @xmath27 at the @xmath28 level , and f300w@xmath18f450w @xmath29 at the @xmath30 level .",
    "the colors do not clearly establish the presence or absence of a lyman break .",
    "however , it is difficult to find examples of lower redshift galaxies with flat spectra from f814w through f450w and a significantly redder f300w@xmath18f450w color .    guided by the colors , a natural identification for the single strong emission line is ly@xmath3 .",
    "this identification places the object at @xmath6 .",
    "we find no other emission lines in the spectrum , which may be taken as support for this identification , since we might expect to see [ oiii ]  4959 , 5007 and h@xmath31 lines if the observed line at 5301  is identified as [ oii ]  3727 . if the ly@xmath3 identification is correct , then the red magnitude of ab@xmath32 corresponds to a rest frame luminosity of about @xmath33 for @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for @xmath36 , with h@xmath37 @xmath21mpc@xmath38 in both cases . for comparison ,",
    "a star formation rate of 1 @xmath39 with a salpeter imf gives produces roughly @xmath40 ( e.g. leitherer , robert , & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "the extracted spectrum of this pair of objects is shown in figure 5 . because the separation between the red `` elliptical '' and the blue `` arc '' is only about @xmath7 ,",
    "the objects are not clearly spatially resolved in our two - dimensional spectrum .",
    "therefore , the extracted spectrum plotted in figure 5 is a composite of both objects .",
    "the composite nature of this spectrum complicates the identification of the lines and the determination of the redshift of the objects .    in the one - dimensional spectrum ,",
    "we tentatively identify a number of absorption features and a pair of emission lines at 5650 and 5664 .",
    "it is natural to associate the absorption features and most of the continuum with the elliptical , because of its red colors and brighter magnitude over the range of wavelengths covered by our spectrum .",
    "similarly , it is natural to identify the possible emission lines with the arc , which has blue colors indicative of a nearly flat spectrum ( @xmath41 ) across the range of bandpasses .",
    "the continuation of the flat spectrum through the f300w bandpass also puts an upper limit of about 2.5 on the redshift of the arc , because of the absence of a lyman break .",
    "moreover , the absence of any strong single emission line in such a blue spectrum ( indicative of a starburst or nuclear activity ) , suggests that the redshift is greater than about one , or we would expect to see lines from either [ oii ] or [ oiii ] and h@xmath31 .",
    "thus , the combination of the colors and the spectrum suggests that the arc is at @xmath42 . given this range ,",
    "our most probable identification of the pair of emission lines is the mgii doublet at 2798 , which would place the arc at a redshift of 1.02 .",
    "this redshift is clearly very tentative .    adopting a similar approach of first constraining the range of reasonable redshifts from the colors , we find that the elliptical galaxy has colors which are consistent with those of an elliptical at a redshift of roughly 0.8",
    ". this redshift estimate may not be unique , as it might also be possible to fit the colors with a redshift around 3.5 .",
    "however , in the high redshift case , the object is much brighter than an ordinary galaxy , while at @xmath43 , the luminosity of the object is close to @xmath44",
    ". detailed photometric redshift analyses by other groups also favor the lower redshift , with cowie ( 1996 ) finding @xmath45 and the approach of lanzetta , yahil , & fernndez - soto ( 1996 ) giving @xmath46 ( yahil 1996 ) . at either redshift",
    ", we have failed to convincingly match the observed absorption lines with prominent stellar and interstellar absorption lines . for the reasons given above",
    ", a lower redshift appears to be favored , but this hypothesis remains unproven by our spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , lensing remains a viable possibility in this case , with our favored redshift being slightly greater than one for the arc and somewhat less than one for the elliptical .",
    "however , further spectroscopy is required to confirm or reject this hypothesis .",
    "our primary result is that gravitational lensing is unlikely to be the cause of the configuration of two of the three candidate lensing systems we have studied .",
    "specifically , we find that the system l4.1 has two distinct velocity components at slightly different positions .",
    "we have also found some evidence against gravitational lensing in the l3.1 system , which was identified by hogg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as the most probable candidate for lensing in the hdf . in the case of the l3.2 system our data are consistent with lensing , but are inconclusive .",
    "it is therefore plausible that there is no more than one multiply imaging lensing system among the approximately 750 objects in the hdf to a limiting magnitude of roughly f814w@xmath47 for the observed magnitudes of the sources .",
    "although we have not obtained spectra for every object in the hdf , we targeted the three systems which appeared to us to be the most likely lensing cases , and two of these three have been similarly identified by other groups ( e.g.  hogg et al .",
    "therefore , we consider it unlikely that there is a large population of undiscovered multiple lensing systems within the magnitude limit given above",
    ".    we can estimate the observed frequency of lensing by combining the number of lenses determined above with the number of potential sources in the hdf . as a starting point",
    "we adopt the number of objects with f814w@xmath47 , which is similar to the magnitude of the fainter candidates we studied .",
    "this limit gives roughly 750 objects which are potential lens sources .",
    "the true number of potential sources is likely to be greater , since this number does not account for magnification of fainter galaxies .",
    "taking our observational limit of one lensing system , we derive a rough lensing rate of around 0.000 - 0.002 ; this estimate clearly has large uncertainties due to the small numbers involved .    even with the large uncertainties , it is difficult to reconcile these observations with the high lensing rates expected in some cosmological models . in particular , cosmological models with large @xmath48 in which the large numbers of faint blue galaxies are a normal evolving galaxy population",
    "appear to be inconsistent with the low rate of multiply imaging lensing of very faint galaxies .",
    "although a detailed model of lensing of galaxies in the hdf is not yet available , it is notable that the frequency of multiply imaging lensing derived above is about an order of magnitude lower than that observed for quasars , which itself places tight constraints on the cosmological constant ( e.g.  kochanek 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , a high @xmath48 , passive evolution model for faint galaxies is only viable if there is some combination of effects which reduce the observed frequency of galaxy lensing by more than an order of magnitude compared to quasars .",
    "a factor of several difference is expected from the lower magnification bias likely for galaxies relative to quasars .",
    "however , the faint galaxies are observed to be compact and are expected in these models to be at rather high redshift , both of which make it hard to reduce the observed lensing rate relative to quasars by more than an order of magnitude . with better statistics , it may be possible to constrain other models for the faint blue galaxies .",
    "for example , if the lensing rate for the faint blue galaxies can be shown to be less than that for quasars and radio sources , the simplest explanation would be that the faint blue galaxies are at modest redshifts compared to these other source populations .",
