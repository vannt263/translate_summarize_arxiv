    "to reduce a higher dimensional nonlinear physical model to some lower dimensional ones is one of the most important approaches in the study of nonlinear science .",
    "usually one use the standard lie group approach to reduce a higher dimensional partial differential equation ( pde ) to lower dimensional ones@xmath0 . lately , the so - called nonclassical lie group analysis is established to find lower dimensional similarity reductions@xmath1 . to find some lower dimensional reductions by using the classical and nonclassical lie group approaches , one has to use some tedious algebraic procedures . in the past decade , to avoid the tedious algebraic calculation in the finding of the similarity reductions , a simple direct powerful method is developed@xmath2 . using the direct method , various new similarity reductions of many physical models",
    "are found though these reductions can also be obtained lately from the nonclassical lie group approach@xmath3 . in @xmath4 ,",
    "the direct method is extended to find some types of conditional similarity reductions which have not yet been obtained by means of the present classical lie group approach and nonclassical lie group approach . in this paper",
    ", we try to extend the direct method in another direction to find lower dimensional reductions that may not be obtained by using the present classical and nonclassical lie group approaches .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the general aspect on the direct reduction method . in section 3 ,",
    "the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional dispersive long wave equation ( dlwe ) is used as a concrete example to realize new reduction idea and to find some new lower dimensional reductions . in section 4",
    ", we use some numerical solutions of the lower dimensional reduction models to discuss some types of exact solutions of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional dlwe .",
    "the last section is a short summary and discussion .",
    "to reduce many types of ( n+1)-dimensional nonlinear pdes , @xmath5=0 , \\ ( x_0\\equiv t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is proven that the special ansatz @xmath6 is sufficient instead of @xmath7 where @xmath8 satisfies an @xmath9-dimensional pde . in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 may be some multi - component fields . however , to reduce a higher dimensional pde to some lower dimensional ones one may use some more general ansatzs instead of ( 3 ) .",
    "for instance , the ansatz ( 3 ) may be extended as @xmath12.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , some types of derivatives of the reduction function may be included in the primary reduction ansatz .",
    "however , to find some concrete results is quite difficult by using the general ansatz ( 4 ) .",
    "by using the similar procedure of the simplification from ( 3 ) to ( 2 ) for many types of significant mathematical physics models , one may simplify ( 4 ) to @xmath13+u_1[w]w_{\\xi_{j_1}\\xi_{j_2} ... \\xi_{j_k}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is one of the highest derivatives of @xmath11 included in ( 4 ) while @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] are @xmath14 independent .",
    "to give out some concrete results from above general reduction ansatz , we take the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional dispersive long wave equation ( 2ddlwe ) @xmath17 as a simple example .",
    "the equation system ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) is first obtained by boiti _",
    "@xmath18 as a compatibility condition for a ` weak ' lax pair",
    ". the infinite dimensional kac - moody - virasoro type symmetry structure of the model is revealed by paquin and winternitz@xmath19 .",
    "the more general @xmath20 symmetry is given in@xmath21 .",
    "it is proven that@xmath22 the 2ddlwe system is fails in passing the painlev test both at the wtc s ( weiss - tabor - carnevale ) @xmath23 meaning and at the ars s ( ablowitz - ramani - segur ) meaning@xmath24 .",
    "using the special ansatz ( 2 ) , nine types of two dimensional similarity reductions and thirteen types of ode ( ordinary differential equation ) reductions has been given by one of the present authors ( lou)@xmath25 .",
    "_    for simplicity further , we taking the reduction ansatz ( 5 ) in a specific form , @xmath26 the reason why we take the ansatz ( 8) is that we try to find the reduction equations have the following three order autonomous pde form @xmath27 for some possible functions @xmath28 .",
    "the ansatz ( 9 ) degenerates two equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) to a same one .    substituting ( 8)-(10 ) into ( 6 ) and/or ( 7 ) yields @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a complicated expression of the indicated variables .",
    "because of @xmath31 is @xmath32 independent , ( 11 ) is valid only for @xmath33 substituting ( 12 ) into ( 11 ) , we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 is independent of @xmath36 . from eq .",
    "( 13 ) we immediately have @xmath37 by using eq .",
    "( 14 ) , ( 13 ) is simplified further to @xmath38 where @xmath39 is @xmath40 independent . integrating ( 15 )",
    "once with respect to @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 with @xmath43 being an integrating function .",
    "because of the @xmath44 independence of @xmath45 , by vanishing the first term of ( 16 ) , we get @xmath46 and @xmath47 because of ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) , eq . ( 16 ) is simplified finally to @xmath48 the compatibility condition of ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) requires that @xmath49 and @xmath50 now the final results show us that the 2ddlwe ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) possesses the following reduction @xmath51 with arbitrary functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath45 is determined by two compatible riccati equations ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) while @xmath55 and @xmath56 are determined by ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) .",
    "the simplest solution of ( 18)(21 ) reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 are arbitrary constants .    from the reduction equation ( 24 )",
    ", we can see that though the original 2ddlwe system is lax integrable , possesses infinitely many symmetries and abundant multi - soliton structures , there still exist various nonintegrable lower dimensional reductions because of the entrance of three arbitrary functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for instance , if we select @xmath52 and @xmath61 simply as @xmath62 then ( 22 ) becomes the well known kdv - burgers equation @xmath63 which is one of the possible candidate to describe the turbulence phenomena in fluid physics and plasma physics@xmath64 . if the functions @xmath52 and @xmath60 are fixed to satisfy @xmath65 -w^2w_x-(b+c)w_{xx}-wc(b - ba+w^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath66 and @xmath67 are arbitrary constants , then ( 24 ) becomes a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional extension @xmath68 -w^2w_x - wc(b - ba+w^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of the famous chaotic system , the lorenz system@xmath69 @xmath70 actually , the travelling wave reduction of ( 32 ) , @xmath71 , is totally equivalent to the lorenz system ( 33 ) .    in principle , any order of derivatives of @xmath11 may be included in the ansatz ( 5 ) . and some types of more complicated reduction equations can be obtained .",
    "for instance , if we insert a fourth order derivative @xmath32 term into the reduction ansatz , we may obtain many fourth order ( 1 + 1)-dimensional pde reductions . here",
    "we list only a special example for the reduction equation has a famous kuramoto - sivashinsky ( ks ) equation form@xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 are arbitrary constants and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are arbitrary functions of @xmath77 .",
    "various interesting properties of the chaotic ks equation ( 37 ) have been studied by many authors , say , @xmath72 and the references therein .    in the reduction results ( 22 ) and ( 37 ) , the independent variables are simply taken as @xmath78 and @xmath77 .",
    "actually , extending these independent variables to some more general forms is possible because the model possesses infinitely many symmetries with some arbitrary functions@xmath79 .",
    "for instance , using the finite transformations given in @xmath19 , all the independent variables of the systems ( 22 ) and ( 37 ) are changed to some general forms naturally .",
    "now an interesting question is which kinds of exact solutions can be obtained from our new reduction equations ? in this section , we write and plot down some interesting exact solutions .",
    "if we take @xmath80 as @xmath81 then we know that the @xmath11 equation ( 22 ) is just the well known kdv equation @xmath82 then we can use the n soliton solutions of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional kdv equation to construct the multi - dromion solutions by taking @xmath83 with @xmath84 being arbitrary constants and @xmath85 .",
    "1 is a plot of the four dromion solution with @xmath11 being two soliton solution of the kdv equation @xmath86 and @xmath87 while the other constants are fixed as @xmath88 the figure ( 1 ) and all other figures of this paper are plotted at time @xmath89 .",
    "epsf      if @xmath90 is still given by ( 43 ) while @xmath11 is given by ( 33 ) , then we may obtain some kinds of periodic or chaotic line soliton solutions . because no one has given ever out any exact explicit solutions of ( 33 ) , we can only use the numerical solutions of the generalized lorenz system to construct exact solutions of the 2ddlwe . for several types of parameter ranges , the solutions of the lorenz system",
    "are periodic while for other types of parameter ranges , the solutions of the lorenz system are chaotic ones .",
    "2 is a plot of the periodic two line soliton solution of the 2ddlwe with the parameters of the lorenz system ( 33 ) is fixed as @xmath91 and @xmath92 epsf    from fig .",
    "2b we can see that the line solution is localized in @xmath41 direction and periodic in @xmath93 direction when the parameters are selected appropriately as ( 45 ) .    fig .",
    "3 plots the chaotic line soliton solution of the 2ddlwe with the parameters of the lorenz system ( 33 ) given by @xmath94 while the @xmath90 function still given by ( 46 ) .",
    "epsf    obviously , fig .",
    "3 shows us that when the parameters of ( 33 ) are located at the chaotic regions , the corresponding solution becomes a chaotic straight line soliton solution which is localized in @xmath41 direction and chaotic in @xmath95 direction .      from ( 28 ) we know that in some cases , the function @xmath90 may be an arbitrary function of @xmath41 ,",
    "so we may also select it as a solutions of the lorenz system ( 33 ) with the replacement of the independent variable @xmath96 .",
    "when the function @xmath97 and @xmath98 are all the solutions of the lorenz system , we can obtain many types of solutions which are periodic or chaotic in both directions .",
    "fig.4 is a plot of a periodic solution of the 2ddlwe which has periodic property in both directions while @xmath99 and @xmath100 are chosen as both the solutions of the lorenz system ( 33 ) with ( 45 ) .",
    "epsf    fig.5 is a plot of an exact solution of the 2ddlwe which is periodic in @xmath41 direction and chaotic in @xmath78 direction .",
    "the corresponding solutions for @xmath90 and @xmath11 are all determined by ( 33 ) but with different parameters ( 45 ) and ( 47 ) respectively .",
    "epsf    fig.6 shows a chaotic solution of the 2ddlwe in both directions .",
    "the related solutions for @xmath90 and @xmath11 are all determined by ( 33 ) with the same parameters ( 47 ) .",
    "in summary , the ck s direct similarity reduction ansatz is extended to a much more general form . using the general reduction ansatz , one may obtain various new lower dimensional reduction equations including many turbulence and chaotic systems . taking the 2ddlwe as a concrete example , and a slightly special reduction ansatz with three order derivatives of the reduction field",
    ", we obtain a general three order quasi - linear equation , which includes the kdv , mkdv , kdv - burgers and the generalized lorenz system as special examples , as a special reduction of the 2ddlwe",
    ". the known ks system and other types of higher order models may also be obtained from the reductions of the 2ddlwe .    the reductions ( 30 ) , ( 32 ) and ( 37 ) are known as some typical turbulence and chaotic systems while the 2ddlwe is known as an ist integrable model .",
    "the reason why some lower dimensional turbulence and chaotic systems can be reduced from a higher dimensional integrable ( under some particular meanings ) model is that for a higher dimensional integrable model , some types of lower dimensional arbitrary functions do enter into its general solution .    using the solutions of the lower dimensional models we may obtain many kinds of new solutions for the 2ddlwe .",
    "especially , using the numerical solutions of the lorenz systems , some types of periodic line solitons , chaotic line solitons , periodic - periodic solution , periodic - chaotic and chaotic - chaotic solutions of the 2ddlwe can be obtained .    in ref .",
    "@xmath101 , using the variable separation approach , we have also pointed out that the turbulence and chaotic systems can be obtained from other ",
    "integrable \" models like the davey - stewartson equations and the asymmetric nizhnik - novikov - veselov equation because of the entrance of the lower dimensional arbitrary functions in the general solutions .",
    "the more about the method and the effects of the reduced turbulence system on the original model(s ) are worthy of studying further .",
    ".2 in the author is in debt to thanks the helpful discussions with the professors q. p. liu , g - x huang and c - p sun .",
