    "the late - stage dynamics of phase separation is often characterised by the presence of droplets , islands or clusters of one phase dispersed in a surrounding medium of another phase .",
    "this may for example be : droplets of a liquid condensing from a supersaturated vapour , phase separation in a binary mixture or alloy , or the condensation to form islands of a liquid or solid phase as particles diffuse over a surface . over time",
    "the average size of the clusters or droplets grows and the total number decreases .",
    "there are two mechanisms by which this can occur .",
    "the first is often referred to as ostwald ripening , in which particles diffuse from the smaller clusters to the larger clusters through the surrounding phase while the centres of the clusters remain fixed in space . lifshitz and slyozov @xcite and wagner @xcite were the first to develop a theory for this process .",
    "for a more recent discussion see for example refs .",
    "the second mechanism by which the clusters may coarsen is via the motion of entire clusters towards other clusters and subsequently joining",
    ". this motion may simply be via droplet diffusion @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it can be due to an imposed external driving , e.g.  by gravity in sedimentation , creaming and the formation of rain drops .",
    "quite often cluster diffusion may be neglected compared to the diffusion of individual particles since the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 through the surrounding material decreases with the inverse of the radius @xmath1 of the diffusing object , e.g. , in three dimensions @xmath2 .",
    "since the radius of a cluster is much larger than an individual particle , the cluster diffusion coefficient is much smaller .",
    "however , this is not always the case , particularly when two drops come close enough to each other that they begin to interact strongly . then capillary and other such forces can lead to their motion and may result in cluster - cluster coalescence .",
    "there are other aspects and theories of aggregation kinetics that are worth mentioning : in earlier models the aggregation process was regarded as irreversible , whereby the thermally activated escape of single particles from clusters was neglected . in this regime",
    "the growth occurs solely due to collisions between smaller clusters that encounter each other traveling by diffusion .",
    "this aggregation scenario is referred to as the diffusion - limited or reaction - limited aggregation @xcite .",
    "later models assume an extended aggregation scenario by taking into account the reversible reorganisation processes , associated with the breaking away and diffusing of particles from one cluster to another @xcite .    in reality ,",
    "all of the above mechanisms play a part in the coarsening dynamics .",
    "however , in different regimes different mechanisms dominate .",
    "when the distance between clusters is large , then the ostwald ripening mechanism dominates , but the escape of particles from clusters can be an extremely slow process .",
    "however , when the density of clusters is sufficiently high , they interact and cluster motion can dominate .",
    "note too that the ostwald ripening mechanism depends on the solubility of the clustering particles in the background ( dispersing ) phase , implying that for strongly phase separating systems , the ostwald coarsening can be very slow .",
    "the cluster motion process also depends strongly on the properties of the dispersing phase and also in the case of systems of particles moving over a surface , on the nature of the interactions with the surface and the degree of surface roughness , since clusters may become pinned on a rough surface . in this paper",
    "we develop a simple model to study the interplay of the different coarsening processes and the influence of the background substrate .",
    "the model we consider here consists of system of one dimensional ( 1d ) brownian particles ( i.e.  rods ) confined in a periodic external potential @xmath3 .",
    "such a situation occurs when particles are confined within a narrow pore , groove or channel .",
    "the amplitude of the modulations in @xmath3 has a significant influence on the rate at which individual particles and also clusters can move through the system .",
    "the particles are assumed to have a hard core of diameter @xmath4 and also an attractive interaction .",
    "this system also serves as a minimal model of molecular transport through micro- and nano - pores featuring the so - called single file diffusion @xcite .",
    "we focus , in particular , on the case of two clusters in the system and study in detail the dynamics of how these clusters join together .",
    "we also focus on small clusters , where it is easier to understand the processes that occur during coalescence .",
    "however , we relate our results to larger clusters and we believe our results are quite general .    we find that the ostwald and translation aggregation mechanisms discussed above are both exhibited by our model system , depending on the values of the system parameters and we also find that as these are varied , there can be a crossover from one mode dominating to the other .",
    "the interplay of these two modes was studied previously for shallow liquid droplets on homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces @xcite . there ,",
    "the analogue of the ostwald process is referred to as the mass transfer mode of the coarsening dynamics of dewetting liquid films @xcite or the mass exchange and collapse mode @xcite .",
    "this refers to when one of two neighbouring liquid droplets shrinks and the other one grows , leading eventually to a single large droplet .",
    "similarly , there is a translation mode @xcite called the spatial motion and collisions mode in @xcite , whereby neighbouring droplets move together and join .",
    "we see here that there are strong parallels between the aggregation dynamics of colloidal ( brownian ) systems and the coarsening dynamics in binary mixtures or in dewetting liquid films @xcite .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of the present model is very similar to that observed in these systems and so we believe that the overall qualitative conclusions we draw in this paper are rather more general than one might expect , given the simple 1d model that we study .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coarsening modes are closely related to the symmetry modes of the systems @xcite .",
    "a particular application of our results is the aggregation in colloidal systems , since we assume the particles move by brownian dynamics .",
    "the rise of nanotechnology has seen a surge of interest in aggregation and cluster formation of colloidal particles with nano - clusters hailed as prototypes of novel functionalized materials @xcite .",
    "the formation of clusters of attracting colloids with their subsequent aggregation into a new solid - like phase is closely linked to the phenomena of glass transitions and gelation @xcite . at a given volume fraction , the uniform density state , which corresponds to a homogeneous suspension of colloids , can become unstable if a certain critical attraction strength is reached .",
    "as the system evolves towards a global minimum of the free energy , the initially formed clusters merge to form bigger aggregates . the final state , which is found in the long time limit , crucially depends on the nature of the interaction potential between the particles . typically , if the interaction is purely attractive up to the hard - core cut - off , the global minimum of the free energy corresponds to a single infinitely large aggregate .",
    "the process when large colloidal clusters collapse to form a disordered solid is known as gelation @xcite .",
    "to describe the dynamics of cluster aggregation we take a statistical mechanical point of view and study the kinetics of the aggregation process using dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) @xcite , which is a theory for the time evolution of the one body density distribution @xmath5 of the particles in the system .",
    "ddft builds on equilibrium density functional theory @xcite and therefore in principle guarantees giving the correct equilibrium fluid density profile , even though its description of the dynamics involves approximation @xcite .",
    "an advantage of ddft over some other approaches , such as the previously used discrete models @xcite is that ddft takes as input the microscopic properties of the particle interactions and particle dynamics .",
    "the approximation for the equilibrium helmholtz free energy functional that we use is based on the exact free energy functional for a 1d fluid of hard rods @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the free energy due to the attraction between the particles is then treated using a simple mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "this is based on the ddft for aggregating hard rods transported along narrow channels developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the model is used to study the directed transport of particles through channels with periodically corrugated walls .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  ii we give a brief overview of the ddft for attractive hard rods and discuss the bulk system phase behaviour , in particular recalling the aspects of the linear stability analysis of the homogeneous phase of the model that are relevant to the present study . in section iii",
    ", we discuss how to obtain the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues corresponding to the two different coarsening modes discussed above and illustrate this with some typical results .",
    "we show that cluster coarsening can be halted by applying a sufficiently strong pinning potential @xmath3 .",
    "the critical strength of the potential , which is necessary to stop clustering , greatly depends on the diameter of the particle @xmath4 and in fact diverges in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "we show that for small and intermediate amplitudes of the external potential the aggregation process is dominated by the ostwald mode if the attraction between particles is rather weak .",
    "however , as the attraction strength is increased , the translation mode becomes dominant , whereas the ostwald mode becomes inactive . in section",
    "iv we discuss further how a cross - over from one coarsening mode to the other can occur .",
    "finally , in section v we make a few concluding remarks .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a system of @xmath7 hard particles of diameter @xmath4 , moving in a channel of length @xmath8 .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions ",
    "i.e.  the channel may be considered to be circular .",
    "the channel is assumed to be sufficiently narrow that the particles are confined to a line and so may be treated as a 1d system of hard rods .",
    "the particles interact with the corrugated channel walls through a periodic potential @xmath3 , which is of period @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is an integer .",
    "in addition to the hard core repulsion between the particles , there is an attractive interaction between the particles that is described by the potential @xmath11 , with the typical interaction range @xmath12 and strength @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of the particles are governed by over damped stochastic equation of motion and so we may use ddft @xcite to approximate the fokker - planck equation for the time evolution of the one - body density distribution @xmath5 as follows @xmath14}{\\delta \\rho(x , t)}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the mobility of a single particle and the helmholtz free energy functional @xmath16 $ ] is given by @xmath17 & = & k_b t \\int_{-\\frac{s}{2}}^{\\frac{s}{2 } } dx\\,\\rho(x , t)[\\ln{\\lambda\\rho(x , t)}-1 ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\int_{-\\frac{s}{2}}^{\\frac{s}{2 } } dx\\,u(x , t)\\rho(x , t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   f_{\\rm hc}[\\rho ] + f_{\\rm at}[\\rho].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq.([dft_energy ] ) the first term is the ideal - gas contribution to the free energy , where @xmath18 is the thermal de broglie wavelength , @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath20 is the temperature .",

    "we use the same notations for the rescaled units , implying that non - dimensional eqs.([fp ] )  ( [ hr_energy ] ) are obtained by setting @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the periodic external potential has the following form @xmath37 the amplitude parameter @xmath38 governs the height of the potential barrier between neighbouring minima in the potential and @xmath39 is the period of the corrugation potential exerted onto the particles by the channel walls .",
    "our simple 1d model may also be used to understand the collective dynamics or particles diffusing over a rough surface . in this context",
    ", @xmath38 may be thought of as a parameter that characterises the roughness of the surface .",
    "we also study smooth channels , which correspond to the limit @xmath40 . in this case , when @xmath41 , if the particles condense to form a cluster or several clusters and so are non - uniformly distributed with density profile @xmath42 , then in this situation the free energy of the system does not change if there is an arbitrary translation in the system ",
    "@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the arbitrary shift distance . in the numerical treatment of this case",
    "some care has to be taken because of the translation symmetry ( see next section ) .",
    "in ref .  @xcite the equilibrium phase behaviour of the model system defined in eqs.([fp ] )  ( [ hr_energy ] ) is studied . as the attraction strength @xmath45 is increased ( or , equivalently , as the temperature @xmath20",
    "is decreased ) the uniform density state @xmath46 that exists for @xmath47 becomes unstable for some range of densities @xmath48 , and phase separation occurs . whilst there is no true phase transition in the system as predicted by the present mean - field model because the system is one dimensional ( i.e.fluctuations round the predicted transition ) , nonetheless , a comparison with brownian dynamics computer simulations reveals that the ddft ( [ fp ] )  ( [ hr_energy ] ) does describe well the aggregation of particles into clusters @xcite .",
    "a cluster state may form spontaneously , if the uniform state is linearly unstable , or there may be a free energy barrier that must be overcome to form clusters ",
    "i.e.  clusters must be nucleated @xcite .",
    "a linear stability analysis @xcite shows that the trivial steady state solution @xmath46 of eq.([fp ] ) , can become linearly unstable with respect to two distinct instability modes : the spinodal mode and the freezing mode , depending on the value of @xmath48 .",
    "expanding on the right hand side of eq .",
    "in powers of the density , one obtains an equation of the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a linear operator . in the linear stability analysis the density is assumed to be of the form @xmath51 , where the amplitude @xmath52 is assumed to be small . substituting this into eq . and then linearising in @xmath52 , one obtains the dimensionless dispersion relation @xcite @xmath53 in the case of an infinitely extended system @xmath54 , the spinodal instability sets in at zero wave number @xmath55 .",
    "in contrast , the freezing instability sets in with a finite critical wave number @xmath56 .",
    "the linear stability analysis allows for a determination of the regions of the phase diagram where phase separation occurs and identifies the length scales of the structures that are formed in the initial stages after a uniform state is quenched into a linearly unstable parameter region @xcite .",
    "however , here our focus is not on the linear short - time dynamics , but on the long - time dynamics , when clusters are already present , whether formed by nucleation or spontaneously after a quench .",
    "these clusters coarsen over time , via one or both of the two mechanisms described in the introduction : either the ostwald ripening mechanism , or via the motion and coalescence of clusters .    to calculate solution branches of steady cluster density profiles and their bifurcations numerically ,",
    "we employ the method presented in ref .",
    "namely , we rewrite our governing integro - differential equations as a finite dimensional dynamical system , i.e.  as a finite set of ordinary differential equations in time . to do so , eq.([fp ] ) is fourier - transformed truncating at a certain number of modes @xmath57 , resulting for our gradient dynamics eq.([fp ] ) in @xmath57 real equations for the fourier coefficients that form the dynamical system . throughout the paper we set @xmath58 .",
    "its solution and bifurcation behaviour is systematically analysed combining fast fourier transforms with pseudo - arclength path continuation @xcite as bundled in the package auto07p @xcite .",
    "the continuation may either be started at a steady state obtained via a direct time simulation or from analytically known small - amplitude harmonic solutions that well approximate non - uniform states close to the primary bifurcations of the uniform state @xcite . however , to numerically obtain @xmath8-periodic steady state solutions of eq.([fp ] ) in a smooth channel , i.e.  the limit @xmath40 , one has to overcome a problem which is related to the translational invariance of solutions in this case . in practice , we use the homotopy method to obtain a weakly modulated steady state with a period equal to the system size , i.e. , we set @xmath59 .",
    "we start the continuation with a constant density @xmath46 , which is a steady state solution when @xmath60 ( so that @xmath61 ) and @xmath41 .",
    "we then introduce an additional homotopy parameter , which multiplies the last three terms in eq.([dft_energy ] ) . in the first continuation run",
    ", the homotopy parameter is increased from zero to one keeping @xmath38 , @xmath45 and @xmath4 at generic values in the linearly stable parameter region .",
    "this results in a weakly modulated steady state . in the second run , this steady state is continued as @xmath45 is increased beyond the point where condensation sets in and large amplitude cluster solutions emerge . in the next run , this large amplitude solution is continued when the heterogeneity amplitude @xmath38 is decreased until it becomes vanishingly small ( typically @xmath62 well approximates a smooth channel ) .",
    "thus , the potential @xmath3 of nearly vanishing amplitude serves in this situation merely as a numerical trick to break the degeneracy related to translational invariance and to fix the steady state solutions in space .",
    "in this section we focus on the dynamics of clusters that have been created either by means of nucleation from a metastable uniform state , or by the linear instability ( spinodal or freezing ) .",
    "in particular , we consider the coalescence of two clusters into one bigger aggregate .",
    "note , that clusters can also be created in the absence of the attraction between the particles , by the potential @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the particles form clusters due to accumulation around the local minima of @xmath3 .",
    "any steady state solution of eq.([fp ] ) in a smooth channel , i.e.  with @xmath41 , has two types of symmetry : ( i ) a translation symmetry and ( ii ) a volume change symmetry .",
    "the existence of these two symmetries for individual clusters gives rise to the two different coarsening mechanisms discussed above if they are combined for several clusters .",
    "this is sketched for droplets on a solid substrate in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for the translation symmetry one sees that if @xmath42 is a single - cluster steady state solution of eq.([fp ] ) , then @xmath63 with an arbitrary shift @xmath64 is also a solution . for small @xmath64 one can write @xmath65 , which implies that @xmath66 is the eigenfunction of the ddft operator @xmath50 linearized around the steady state @xmath42 , with zero eigenvalue @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 . in what follows",
    "we refer to @xmath66 as the translation symmetry mode eigenfunction , which is sometimes called goldstone mode of this continuous symmetry . combining translation modes with opposite signs for two adjacent droplets",
    "gives the translation mode of coarsening .",
    "the volume change symmetry is associated with the normalization ( particle conservation ) condition of the solution of eq.([fp ] ) .",
    "given a density profile @xmath42 , which is a single - cluster steady state solution of eq.([fp ] ) , with @xmath69 we now consider the density profile @xmath70 , with @xmath71 that is also a steady state solution of eq.([fp ] ) for some small @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath73 , we deduce that @xmath74 is another eigenfunction of the operator @xmath50 with zero eigenvalue @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , the volume symmetry mode @xmath76 , corresponds to the derivative with respect to the density @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath77 , where we define @xmath78 combining volume modes with opposite signs for two adjacent droplets gives the mass transfer mode of coarsening which we refer to as the ostwald ripening mode .",
    "note that one may alternatively calculate the ostwald mode eigenfunction by considering the change @xmath79 from an infinitesimally small change in the value of the chemical potential , @xmath80 .",
    "thus , any steady state solution @xmath42 has the two neutrally stable symmetry modes .",
    "if these respective modes are combined for pairs or groups of clusters one obtains the various coarsening mode eigenfunctions that for homogeneous systems normally have small positive eigenvalues resulting from the overlap of the tails of the symmetry modes of the individual clusters . if one now breaks the translation symmetry by considering a heterogeneous system with @xmath81 , the stability and characteristics of translation and ostwald coarsening modes closely related to the two introduced eigenfunctions still define the dynamics of coarsening .    in order to illustrate this discussion ,",
    "one may examine the simple situation where an ideal gas of non - interacting particles ( i.e.  @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) is confined within a parabolic potential @xmath84 , where @xmath85 determines the strength of the confinement .",
    "this is arguably the simplest example of a cluster , where the particles remain in the cluster due to the confinement of the external potential .",
    "the equilibrium density profile is obtained from minimising the the grand potential @xcite @xmath86=f[\\rho]-\\mu\\int_{-s/2}^{s/2}\\rho(x)dx,\\ ] ] where the helmholtz free energy @xmath87 results from eq .",
    "and @xmath88 is the chemical potential , which is the lagrange multiplier enforcing the constraint .",
    "when @xmath8 is large , we obtain the density profile @xmath89 , where @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the translation mode eigenfunction is @xmath91 . in order to determine the volume mode eigenfunction we note that @xmath92 , and so using eq .",
    "we find that the volume mode eigenfunction is @xmath93 .",
    "note that the translation and volume mode eigenfunctions are orthogonal .",
    "we now consider two such confining potentials generating two clusters a distance @xmath44 apart .",
    "in this situation @xmath94 , for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , for @xmath97 .",
    "the resulting density profile exhibits two ` clusters ' centered at @xmath98 and the density profile @xmath99 suppose now that there are slightly more particles ( @xmath72 ) in the left hand cluster than in the right hand cluster .",
    "in this situation , the ostwald mode eigenfunction is : @xmath100 this eigenfunction indicates that there will be a diffusion of particles from one side to the other .",
    "one must calculate the eigenvalue to determine the direction of this flux , although in this simple situation one knows already that the symmetric state is stable , i.e. , the eigenvalue must be negative and the flux is from left to right .",
    "one may also examine the translation mode eigenfunction , although in this simple case this mode is not relevant .",
    "however , when we introduce the attraction between the particles , this mode can become relevant and the two clusters can seek to move toward one another .",

    "thus , we associate the period-@xmath39 cluster with @xmath135 particles located at the minima of @xmath3 , as shown by the dashed lines in fig.[f5 ] . since the attraction strength between particles decreases exponentially with distance , we only need to take into account the interactions between nearest neighbour particles ( clusters ) .",

    "the physical reason why the ostwald coarsening process for particles with no hard core ( @xmath82 ) can not be stabilized by increasing the amplitude of the pinning potential @xmath3 to some threshold value , can be explained as follows : particles with no hard core repulsion can always be squeezed into a cluster of arbitrarily small size .",
    "so , initially , strong periodic potentials @xmath3 split the particles into dense clusters , each located at a local minimum of @xmath3 .",
    "however , even in the limit @xmath141 , the question of the stability of the dense clusters that are located in the minima of @xmath3 , becomes the standard escape problem of a single particle from a potential well .",

    "if there are only @xmath144 particles within the system , one finds four different steady state solutions of eq.([fp ] ) , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "the two rods are indicated by rectangles and the corresponding density distributions are indicated as well .",
    "the steady states of these two hard rods consists of the individual particles either being at the minima ( fig .",

    "generally , stabilization occurs at a much lower @xmath38 value , due to the fact that a steady state can be linearly stable even if it has a higher energy than some other steady state .",
    "the exact locus of points in the @xmath132 plane , where linearly stable period-@xmath115 solutions exists , is given by the dashed line in fig.[f7](a ) , which presents the modification of the stability diagram in fig.[f4](c ) due to a non - zero rod length @xmath154 .",

    "remarkably , we see from fig.[f7](a ) that at non - zero @xmath38 , one can switch between the translation mode for coarsening and the ostwald mode by changing @xmath45 .    numerically integrating eq.([fp ] ) we obtain the time evolution of the density profile , with the period-@xmath39 solution as the initial condition as displayed in fig.[f7](b ) .",
    "we see that for @xmath155 and @xmath156 the dynamics of the coalescence of two period-@xmath39 clusters is indeed via the ostwald mode . as expected from fig.[f7](a ) , in this scenario , one of the maxima of the density profile grows at the expense of the other .",
    "increasing @xmath45 we find that the translation mode becomes dominant . in the example displayed along the bottom row in fig.[f7 ] which is for @xmath157 and @xmath156",

    "the two unstable clusters at the potential minima first move both towards the separating maximum , where they coalesce into the solution on the bp@xmath158 branch . note that this solution is itself unstable ( on a larger time scale ) , as it represents a saddle in function space .",
    "however , it acts as an organising center for the coarsening process as it first attracts the time evolution along its stable direction ( related to its stable eigenvalue closest to zero ) to then expell it along its only unstable direction ( in function space ) on a time scale controlled by its unstable eigenvalue . as a consequence",
    ", the fused cluster slowly translates into one of the potential minima , becoming the solution on the bp@xmath159 branch .",
    "in other words , the time scale of the coarsening is controlled by the eigenvalues of the initial two - cluster state and of the unstable solution on the bp@xmath158 branch .",
    "overall , the eignevalue with the smallest absolute value gives a good estimate for the time scale of the coalescence .",
    "up to this point we have focused on the coalescence of two ` clusters ' which each only consist of @xmath153 particle ( on average ) .",
    "the fair question arises as to whether or not the results summarized in fig.[f7 ] remain at least qualitatively valid for bigger clusters of @xmath160 particles .",
    "the complete answer to this question depends on the choice of the length scale parameters such as the rod length @xmath4 , the period @xmath39 of the channel potential and the system size @xmath8 , all expressed in units of @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , by increasing the number of particles in the system , i.e.  by increasing the average density @xmath48 , one increases the minimal possible size of the cluster , given by @xmath143 .",
    "clearly , one can expect to uncover a rather different behavior for @xmath161 , where the cluster size is much smaller than the period of @xmath3 and for @xmath162 , with cluster sizes comparable to the period of @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , different dynamical regimes can be expected for different separation distances between the clusters as compared to their size . in view of this , it is clear that a complete account of all the possible dynamical regimes of the cluster formation is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "here we focus on the most simple case where the smallest cluster size @xmath143 is much smaller than both , the period of @xmath3 and the separation distance between the clusters .    under such conditions , the energy - based arguments used above for the case of @xmath144 , as illustrated in figs .",

    "initially , the clusters move towards each other rather slowly , but after a certain time @xmath179 , the increasing attractive forces become rather strong and the remaining stages of the coalescence is a very quick process with the typical time scale of @xmath180 as compared to @xmath181 for the initial slow approach .",

    "i.e. for @xmath185 , the ostwald coarsening process is suppressed by the close proximity of the clusters .",
    "as shown in the previous section , for fixed center - to - center distance between the clusters , the translation mode dominates the aggregation process for large @xmath7 and @xmath45 .",

    "for @xmath189 ( fig.[f9](a ) ) , the translation mode dominates in the entire @xmath45 range where the coarsening modes are active ( @xmath190 ) and there is a strong separation of the time scales @xmath191 of the two coarsening modes beyond the minimum of the eigenvalue of the translation mode at @xmath192 .",
    "the ostwald mode stabilises at @xmath193 .",
    "however , at the larger distance @xmath194 ( fig.[f9](b ) ) , the ostwald mode dominates the aggregation process for a relatively weak attraction @xmath195 and a cross - over between the coarsening modes occurs at @xmath196 , with the translation mode dominating for stronger attraction . as the separation distance @xmath187 is further increased ( see , e.g.  @xmath197 in fig.[f9](c ) ) , the cross - over point is shifted towards ever larger values of @xmath45 .",
    "an example of the dynamics of coalescence of two @xmath166 clusters is shown for @xmath198 ( @xmath197 ) and @xmath199 in the right panel of fig.[f9 ] . there , the ostwald mode ( @xmath200 ) acts on a shorter time scale @xmath201 than the translation mode ( @xmath202 ) , as indicated by filled circles in fig .",
    "[ f9](c ) . as coarsening progresses , the positions of the clusters remain practically unchanged . due to the diffusion of particles from one cluster to the other that characterizes the ostwald mode , one of the cluster shrinks whereas the other one increases in size .",
    "eventually , one large cluster with @xmath170 particles ( period-@xmath115 solution ) is formed .    in order to decide",
    "which mode is dominant under which conditions , one can use the following qualitative argument , which is valid for strongly attracting particles . the time scale associated with the ostwald mode",
    "can be estimated as follows : the binding energy @xmath203 of a single rod that joins or leaves the cluster , is independent of the number of particles in the cluster , provided that this number is rather large .",
    "therefore , the escape rate @xmath204 of the particles at the surface of the cluster is given by @xmath205 .",
    "assuming that only one particle can escape from the cluster at a time , we estimate the characteristic time @xmath206 , which is needed for @xmath7 particles to escape from the cluster @xmath207    after the particle has escaped , it still needs to diffuse the distance @xmath187 between the two clusters in order to join the other cluster .",
    "the diffusion time is estimated as @xmath208 . in order to estimate the time scale associated with the translation mode , we note that two clusters of @xmath7 particles each can move and collide as the result of the attraction between the clusters .",
    "this scenario resembles standard diffusion - limited aggregation @xcite with an additional migration of clusters due to attraction .",
    "thus , if @xmath209 the attraction force between the clusters is proportional to @xmath210 , i.e. @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the derivative of the pair potential .",
    "therefore , the force per particle is @xmath213 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath214 of a compact cluster of @xmath7 particles is smaller than the diffusion coefficient of a single particle by a factor of @xmath215 , i.e. @xmath216 .",
    "consequently , the time scale of the translation mode is influenced by the time scale due to attraction @xmath217 and the time scale due to cluster diffusion @xmath218 .",
    "if they are very different the smaller one will dominate . in the overdamped limit",
    "we obtain @xmath219 where we have used the exponential pair potential @xmath220 .",
    "the time scale estimates in eqs.([ec_mode ] ) and ( [ vol_mode ] ) can now be compared to the numerical findings reported in figs .",
    "[ f8 ] and [ f9 ] .",
    "it is clear that the dependence on the cluster size is estimated to @xmath221 , explaining why the aggregation is dominated by the translation mode in fig.[f8 ] . on the other hand , when the cluster size @xmath7 is fixed and @xmath187 is increased , the shortest time scale for the translation mode is ultimately determined by clusters diffusion @xmath222 .",
    "the @xmath187 dependence of the ostwald mode time scale @xmath223 is also quadratic .",
    "however , for large clusters @xmath224 , we have @xmath225 , which explains the dominance of the ostwald mode at large separation distances as shown in fig.[f9 ] .",
    "finally , by examining the dependence on the attraction strength @xmath45 , we conclude that the ostwald mode remains effectively frozen for strong attraction , because the time scale associated with the escape from the cluster increases exponentially with @xmath45 , i.e.@xmath226 .",
    "the translation mode , on the other hand , increases its dominance @xmath227 due to increased attraction between the clusters .",
    "this linear increase of the translation mode eigenvalue with @xmath45 is demonstrated by thick dot - dashed lines in fig.[f8](a ) .",
    "we note that the qualitative estimates derived above can not be used to describe the evaporation - condensation process in the case when the edge - to - edge separation distance between two clusters is comparable to or smaller than the cluster size . as a consequence ,",
    "the stabilization of the ostwald mode is not captured by the approximation .",
    "phase separation occurs in order to minimize the total free energy of the system . a quenched initially uniform system forms clusters which then tend to merge to form bigger aggregates , because this reduces the amount of interfaces between phases and therefore the interfacial contribution to the free energy .",
    "the dynamics of the aggregation process , also known as coarsening dynamics , crucially depends on the distance between the clusters , their size and the attraction strength .",
    "we have studied the coalescence of two equally - sized clusters separated by a distance larger than the cluster size .",
    "the clusters can merge either as the result of their motion and subsequent collision , or as a result of the ostwald ripening process , whereby particles diffuse from one cluster to another .",
    "this process is somewhat akin to an evaporation - condensation process ",
    "i.e.  the particles evaporate from the smaller drop and then travel to condense on the larger drop .",
    "we have shown that both coarsening modes can be suppressed and , consequently , the clustering can be ` frozen ' , by a sufficiently strong pinning action of the external potential @xmath3 , associated with the corrugation of the channel walls . in the case of the smooth channel walls",
    ", we have demonstrated that the translation mode dominates the aggregation process for large cluster sizes and for strongly attracting particles .",
    "in fact , the ostwald mode can be effectively arrested in the strong attraction limit .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that there is a cross - over between the coarsening modes , induced by changing the separation distance between the clusters .",
    "regardless of the how strong is the attraction between the particles , the time scale associated with the translation mode can be rendered much larger than the ostwald mode time scale by increasing the distance between clusters .",
    "although our results are for a simple 1d model , we believe that our overall conclusions about the behaviour and the interplay of the two different coarsening modes should apply much more generally .",
    "we expect two dimensional clusters aggregating on surfaces to behave in a qualitatively similar manner .",
    "in this situation the corrugation potential @xmath3 in our system models a rough potential due to the surface , with the parameter @xmath38 characterising the surface roughness . similarly , we expect our results to also be relevant to coarsening of clusters in three dimensions . to relate our results to these systems , one should think of the density profiles we calculate as corresponding to the cross - sectional density profile through a pair of two- or three - dimensional clusters .",
    "in fact , as mentioned above , because in 1d there is no true phase transition , but in two- and three - dimensions there is a phase transition , the effect of fluctuations that to some extent have been neglected in the present mean - field treatment , will be less influential in two and three dimensions ."
