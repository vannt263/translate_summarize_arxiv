    "since the early work by langer @xcite , a lot of attention has been devoted to the study of first order phase transitions using the instanton methods @xcite .",
    "these methods can be applied at zero temperature@xcite as well as at finite temperature @xcite , and they have been widely used in connection with phase transitions in the early universe @xcite .",
    "the basic predicament of this formalism is that the false vacuum decay rate per unit volume is given by an expression of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the euclidean action of an instanton .",
    "the instanton is a solution of the euclidean equations of motion with appropriate boundary conditions , whose analytic continuation to lorentzian time represents the nucleation of a bubble of true vacuum in the false vacuum phase .",
    "when more than one instanton is compatible with the boundary conditions , one has to consider the one with the least euclidean action , which of course will dominate eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) .",
    "the preexponential factor @xmath13 arises from gaussian functional integration over small fluctuations around the instanton solution .    at zero temperature ,",
    "the first order phase transition is dominated by quantum tunneling through a potential barrier .",
    "this tunneling is represented by a maximally symmetric instanton , which , in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions , is a @xmath1 symmetric configuration . on the other hand , at sufficiently high temperature",
    ", the phase transition is dominated by thermal hopping to the top of the potential barrier .",
    "this process is represented by a ` static ' @xmath4 symmetric instanton .    in the context of quantum mechanics ( i.e. , @xmath14 dimensions ) , the decay of a metastable state at ` intermediate ' temperatures",
    "was studied by affleck @xcite . under certain assumptions for the shape of the potential barrier",
    ", he found that the transition between quantum tunneling and thermally assisted ` hopping ' occurred at a temperature @xmath15 of the order of the curvature of the potential at the top of the barrier . at temperatures",
    "@xmath16 , the decay was dominated by ` periodic ' instantons ( solutions of the euclidean equations of motion which are periodic in imaginary time ) , with periodicity @xmath17 .",
    "such periodic instantons smoothly interpolated between the zero temperature instanton and the static ` thermal hopping ' instanton .",
    "however , as noted by chudnovsky @xcite , this situation is not generic .",
    "depending on the shape of the potential barrier , it can happen that the transition from quantum tunneling to thermal activation occurs at a temperature @xmath8 larger than @xmath15 , and in that case , there is a sudden discontinuity in the derivative of the nucleation rate with respect to the temperature at @xmath8 . in @xcite",
    "this was called a first order transition in the decay rate .    in the context of field theory , little",
    "work has been done toward the study of periodic instantons other than the trivial static one . in this paper",
    "we shall study such periodic instantons in the case when the so - called thin wall approximation is valid .",
    "that is , when thickness of the domain wall that separates the true from the false vacuum is small compared with the radius of the nucleated bubble .",
    "also , we shall restrict ourselves to @xmath4 symmetric solutions . as we shall see , for @xmath5 and @xmath6 spatial dimensions ,",
    "new periodic solutions exist but only in a finite temperature range in the vicinity of @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is the radius of the zero temperature instanton .",
    "we shall see that these new instantons have higher euclidean action than the static or the spherical ones , and so they will never give the dominant contribution to the nucleation rate ( [ basic ] ) . barring the possibility that new non-@xmath4-symmetric instantons may alter the picture",
    ", this suggests that there is a sudden change in the derivative of the nucleation rate with respect to the temperature at @xmath8 , the temperature at which the action of the spherical instanton becomes equal to the action of the cylindrical one . in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite this corresponds to a first order transition in the decay rate .",
    "the case @xmath9 is somewhat different , since in that case the new periodic solutions have lower action than the static one , and they mediate a smooth transition between the zero temperature instanton and the high temperature one .",
    "another point that we shall be concerned with is the evaluation of the determinantal prefactor @xmath13 for the case of the static instanton . in this case , the action is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the energy of a critical bubble ( i.e. a bubble in unstable equilibrium between expansion and contraction ) and @xmath20 is the inverse of the temperature . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , apart from a factor of @xmath21 needed on dimensional grounds , the prefactor @xmath13 is essentially the partition function of small excitations around the critical bubble configuration . upon exponentiation ,",
    "this has the effect of replacing @xmath22 by @xmath23 in the exponent of ( [ basic ] ) , where @xmath24 is the free energy of the bubble plus fluctuations . at temperatures @xmath7 the energy @xmath19 and the free energy @xmath24 are approximately the same , and so the prefactor @xmath13 does not play much of a role .",
    "however , as we shall see , for @xmath3 and @xmath25 , the entropic contribution due to deformations of the domain wall can be very large , giving an exponential enhancement to the decay rate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we study the periodic instantons , and the transition from the low to the high temperature regimes . in section 3",
    "we evaluate the determinantal prefactors for the static instanton in the zero thickness limit , that is , the only fluctuations we consider are deformations in the shape of the wall .",
    "this is supposed to be a good approximation at temperatures @xmath26 , were @xmath27 is the mass of the free particle excitations in the theory ( supposed to be of the same order of magnitude than the inverse thickness of the wall ) .",
    "section 4 extends the result for the prefactors to temperatures @xmath28 .",
    "finally , some conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "in the thin wall approximation , the dynamics of a bubble is well described by an action of the form @xmath29 the first term is the nambu action , proportional to the area of the worldsheet of the wall separating true from false vacua , where @xmath30 is the tension of the wall , @xmath31 is a set of @xmath32 coordinates on the worldsheet and @xmath33 is the determinant of the worldsheet metric .",
    "the second term is the volume enclosed by the wall times the difference in vacuum energy density between both sides of the wall , which we denote by @xmath34 , integrated over time .",
    "in spherical coordinates the metric in @xmath0 dimensional flat space - time reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the line element on the @xmath37sphere . with a spherical ansatz ,",
    "the worldsheet of the domain wall separating the true from the false vacuum is given by @xmath38 . in terms of @xmath39 ,",
    "the action reads @xmath40 , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 is the surface of the unit @xmath37 sphere , and we have used @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the volume inside the unit @xmath45-sphere .    since the lagrangian does not depend explicitly on time , the equation of motion for the radius of the bubble , @xmath46 , reduces to the conservation of energy , @xmath47.\\label{energy}\\ ] ] this can be cast in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49^{-2}-1.\\label{potential}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ particle ] ) describes the motion of a non - relativistic particle moving in the potential @xmath50 .    to obtain the decay rates ,",
    "one first has to find the relevant instantons .",
    "these are solutions of the euclidean equations of motion with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "taking @xmath51 in ( [ particle ] ) we have @xmath52 at finite temperature @xmath53 , the instantons have to be periodic in @xmath54 , with periodicity @xmath55 . also , the solutions have to approach the false vacuum at spatial infinity @xcite .",
    "the instanton for @xmath56 is well known .",
    "integrating ( [ particlee ] ) one has @xmath57 where @xmath58 this is the zero temperature instanton , an @xmath32-sphere of radius @xmath2 .",
    "it has the @xmath1 symmetry , as opposed to the solutions for @xmath59 , which only have @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "this instanton has euclidean action @xmath60 the same instanton also exists at finite temperature , @xmath61 ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , except that the sphere is repeated periodically along the @xmath54 axis . the action is still given by ( [ se0 ] ) , and so it is independent of temperature ( apart from finite temperature corrections to the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath30 , which are not relevant to our present discussion ) .",
    "for temperatures @xmath62 the spheres do not fit in the euclidean time interval , and the solution with @xmath56 no longer exists .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that for @xmath62 the ` overlapping ' spheres would somehow merge into a wiggly cylinder ( see fig .",
    "1c ) , and ultimately into a straight cylinder at even higher temperatures ( fig .",
    "however , we would like to stress that this is not necessarily so .",
    "as we shall see , at least in the thin wall approximation and for @xmath32=2 and 3 , wiggly cylinder solutions exist only for a finite range of temperatures , which happens to be below @xmath63 [ see eq .",
    "( [ range ] ) ] .",
    "consider the case @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding potential @xmath50 is plotted in fig .",
    "the turning points are given by @xmath64.\\ ] ] for @xmath65 we have euclidean solutions which oscillate between the two turning points .",
    "these are the wiggly cylinder solutions mentioned before",
    ". the period of oscillation @xmath66 can be computed from ( [ particlee ] ) , @xmath67,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the complete elliptic integrals @xcite . a plot of @xmath71 is given in fig .",
    "3 . by changing the energy ,",
    "the periodicity @xmath71 changes over a finite range , and since @xmath72 , the wiggly cylinder solutions only exist for a finite range of temperatures [ see ( [ range ] ) ] .",
    "the case @xmath6 is qualitatively similar .",
    "the equation for the turning points , @xmath73 , @xmath74 has now three solutions , but one of them is negative , so again we have two physical turning points .    in both cases , as the energy is increased from @xmath56 , the two turning points approach each other , and they eventually merge when @xmath75 at radius @xmath76 these equations can be obtained from the conditions @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the period of the solutions as @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 . here",
    "@xmath81 is the frequency of the oscillations at the bottom of the well . using ( [ potential ] )",
    "we find @xmath82 hence the lower bound on the temperature range in which the wiggly cylinder solutions exist @xmath83    it is clear from the conditions ( [ conditions ] ) that the straight cylinder ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath84 is also a solution of ( [ particlee ] ) corresponding to @xmath85 .",
    "since it is static , this solution exists for all temperatures .",
    "the corresponding euclidean action @xmath86 is inversely proportional to the temperature .",
    "therefore this will be the dominant instanton at sufficiently high temperature .",
    "the physical interpretation of the three types of instantons can be inferred from their analytic continuation to real time .",
    "the ` straight cylinder ' represents thermal hopping to the top of the barrier , creating a critical bubble in unstable equilibrium that can either recollapse under the tension of the wall or expand under the negative pressure exerted by the false vacuum .",
    "the ` zero temperature ' solution @xmath56 represents the spontaneous quantum creation of a bubble from ` nothing ' ( i.e. from a small quantum fluctuation ) . this bubble is larger than the critical bubble and after nucleation it expands to infinity .",
    "the wiggly cylinder instantons represent a combination of both phenomena . a subcritical bubble of finite energy that has been created by a thermal fluctuation tunnels through the barrier to a supercritical bubble which can subsequently expand to infinity .",
    "let us now show that for @xmath5 and @xmath87 the process represented by the wiggly cylinders is never dominant . from ( [ energy ] ) ,",
    "euclideanizing and integrating over one period of oscillation ( @xmath88 ) we have ( @xmath89 is the action for the wiggly cylinders ) @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "using @xmath92^{-1/2}\\ ] ] and ( [ particlee ] ) , one easily arrives at @xmath93 from which one obtains the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath94 as @xmath19 approaches @xmath95 from below , the amplitude of the wiggles tends to zero and we have @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the action for the straight cylinder at @xmath98 .",
    "also , when @xmath19 approaches zero from above the amplitude of the wiggles becomes so large that in fact the cylinder fragments into spheres @xmath99 from ( [ hj ] ) one has @xmath100 it then follows that in the whole range @xmath101 in which the wiggly cylinders exist , the action for the wiggly cylinder @xmath89 is larger than both @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this means that the decay rate , which has the exponential dependence @xmath104 will be dominated either by the zero temperature instanton or by the straight cylinder instanton , but never by the wiggly cylinder .",
    "the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "4 .    define @xmath8 as the temperature at which the action for the cylinder is equal to the action for the sphere , @xmath105 . for @xmath5 @xmath106 , and for @xmath6 @xmath107 , so @xmath108 .",
    "for @xmath109 the decay is dominated by the spherical instantons , corresponding to zero temperature quantum tunneling , whereas for @xmath110 it is dominated by the cylindrical one , corresponding to thermal hopping .",
    "since the slopes @xmath111 do not match at @xmath112 , there will be a sudden change in the derivative of the nucleation rate at this temperature . in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite , this corresponds to a first order transition in the decay rate .",
    "this applies in the case when the thin wall approximation is valid .",
    "to what extent the results apply for thick walls remains unclear to us .",
    "some comments will be made in the concluding section .",
    "the above considerations do not cover the case @xmath9 .",
    "this case is special because the force exerted by the false vacuum on the `` wall '' can not be compensated by the spatial curvature of the wall , which now reduces to a pair of `` point - like '' kink and antikink .",
    "this case has previously been considered in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the context of tunneling and activated motion of a string accross a potential barrier . for @xmath56 the solution of ( [ particle ] ) is a circle of radius @xmath113 , and so the zero temperature instanton is analogous to the higher dimensional ones . for @xmath59 , however , the situation is different because the potential @xmath50 has only one turning point . as a result in the thin wall limit",
    "the periodic solutions , which are essentially arcs of the circle of radius @xmath2 , contain mild singularities , vertices where the worldlines of the kinks meet ( see fig .",
    "5 . note that such vertices can not be constructed for @xmath25 , since the worldsheet curvature would diverge there ) .",
    "the use of vertices is just an artifact of the thin wall approximation",
    ". they can be ` rounded off' by introducing a short range attractive force between the kink and anti - kink , in the manner described in @xcite .",
    "because of this force , the potential @xmath50 is modified and a new turning point appears at @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the range of the attractive force ( which in field theory will be of the order of the thickness of the kink ) . as a result",
    "the instantons have a shape similar to fig .",
    "1c .    for @xmath9",
    "the zero temperature action is given by ( [ se0 ] ) , @xmath116 . the action for the finite temperature periodic instantons is @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the length of one of the world - lines of kink or anti - kink and @xmath13 is the area enclosed between them .",
    "we have @xmath119,\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is related to the temperature @xmath121 through ( see fig .",
    "5 ) @xmath122 for @xmath123 this instanton reduces to the zero temperature one , the circle of radius @xmath2 .",
    "as we increase temperature above @xmath124 , @xmath120 decreases , and in the limit @xmath125 we have @xmath126    in addition , if we take into account the short range attractive force between the kink and anti - kink we will have the static instanton for all temperatures ( the analogous of the straight cylinder representing thermal hopping ) .",
    "this consists of two parallel world - lines separated by a distance @xmath127 , representing a pair in unstable equilibrium between the short range attractive force and the negative pressure of the false vacuum that pulls them apart @xcite . for @xmath128 we can neglect the false vacuum term in the action , and the action is just proportional to the length of the world - lines @xmath129 in the high temperature limit this coincides with @xmath130 .",
    "the diagram of action versus temperature is sketched in fig .",
    "the `` static '' instanton , whose action is depicted as a slanted solid line , is always subdominant . since @xmath131 at @xmath132",
    ", it follows that the transition from the quantum tunneling regime to the thermally assisted regime is now of second order ( in the terminology of @xcite ) .",
    "here we have concentrated in studying the instantons on the thin wall limit . it is often claimed that the action for these instantons gives the exponential dependence of the nucleation rates .",
    "however , as we shall see , contributions from the determinantal prefactor can be exponentially large at temperatures @xmath133 .",
    "at zero temperature , the nucleation rates per unit volume @xmath134 in the thin wall limit have been given e.g. in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 is riemann s zeta function . for @xmath5",
    "the result contains an arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath139 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these results should apply as long as @xmath140 , when the decay is dominated by the spherical instanton .    for @xmath110 and @xmath141 , as we have seen ,",
    "the decay is dominated by the static instanton . for an action of the form ( [ actioncov ] ) ,",
    "the second variation of the action due to small fluctuations of the worldsheet around a classical solution is given by @xcite @xmath142 physically , @xmath143 has the meaning of a small normal displacement of the worldsheet . here",
    "@xmath31 is a set of coordinates on the instanton worldsheet , @xmath33 is the determinant of the worldsheet metric and @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the laplacian on the worldsheet and @xmath146 whith @xmath147 the intrinsic ricci scalar of the worldsheet .    for the static ` cylinder ' instantons , @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the laplacian on the @xmath37sphere .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath150 in this case are given by @xmath151 where @xmath152 @xmath153 , @xmath154 and the degeneracy of each eigenvalue is given by @xmath155 , where @xmath156 since the critical bubble is a static configuration , it turns out that @xmath157 are also the eigenvalues of the second variation of the hamiltonian around this configuration .",
    "note that the lowest eigenvalue , @xmath158 , is negative @xmath159 .",
    "this is because the static cylinder is in unstable equilibrium between expansion and contraction .    the preexponential factor in the decay rate is given in terms of the determinant of the operator @xmath150 @xcite @xmath160 where @xmath161 for given @xmath162 , the product over @xmath163 can be easily computed by using the generalized @xmath164function method @xcite",

    "this is due to the fact that some of the eigenmodes of @xmath150 do not really correspond to deformations of the worldsheet but to space translations of the worldsheet as a whole .",
    "they are the so - called zero modes . as a result",
    ", @xmath150 has @xmath32 vanishing eigenvalues , corresponding to the number of independent translations of the cylinder ( these eigenvalues are the @xmath171 , of which there are @xmath172 ) .",
    "the usual way of handling this problem is the following . in the gaussian functional integration over small fluctuations around the classical solution , which leads to the determinant in ( [ reit ] ) ,",
    "one replaces the integration over the amplitudes of the zero modes by an integration over collective coordinates .",
    "the transformation to collective coordinates introduces a jacobian @xmath173 and the integration over collective coordinates introduces a space volume factor @xmath50 .",
    "the zero eigenvalues have now to be excluded from the determinant , and noting that @xmath174 we have @xmath175 the decay rate at temperatures above @xmath8 is thus given by @xmath176 where @xmath177 here we have used @xmath178 , where @xmath95 is the energy of the critical bubble , given by ( [ ec ] ) . since @xmath179 is the partition function for a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath165 at temperature @xmath166 , the second term in the r.h.s . of ( [ f ] )",
    "has a clear interpretation .",
    "each physical mode of oscillation will be excited by the thermal bath , and will make its contribution to the free energy @xcite . thus @xmath24 can be thought of as the total free energy of the bubble plus fluctuations .",
    "let us analyze the contribution of the fluctuations to the free energy in more detail .",
    "from ( [ zl ] ) we have @xmath180 the first term in the right hand side contains the energy of zero point oscillations of the membrane , and can be thought as quantum correction to the mass of the membrane , of the same nature as the casimir energy which arises in field theory in the presence of boundaries or non - trivial topology .",
    "indeed , from ( [ op ] ) , the fluctuations @xmath181 behave like a scalar field of mass @xmath182 living on the worldsheet .",
    "since the worldsheet has non - trivial topology , this will result in a casimir energy @xmath183 .",
    "this expression is of course divergent and it needs to be regularized and renormalized in the usual way .    for @xmath5 one obtains the renormalized expression ( see e.g.",

    "we have studied periodic instantons for vacuum decay in the thin wall approximation , using a spherical ansatz for the spatial sections . for the case of one spatial dimension ( @xmath9 ) , the periodic instantons have lower action than the static one ( see fig .",

    ", it approaches that of the static one @xcite .",
    "then , from the hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ hj ] ) and the fact that @xmath273 is monotonously decreasing , it follows that the action for the periodic instantons is lower than that of the static or the zero temperature ones in the whole range @xmath16 . in that case ,",

    "finally , we have studied the determinantal prefactor in the nucleation rate for the case of the static instanton , in the thin wall case .",
    "we have seen that for @xmath25 and @xmath133 there is an exponential enhancement of the nucleation rate [ see eq .",

    "the exponential law ( [ pren1 ] ) no longer applies , since one has to consider excitations in the internal structure of the membrane . in this regime one obtains ( [ tgran3 ] ) and ( [ tgran2 ] ) , which still contain a sizable enhancement above the naive estimate @xmath275 .    the case @xmath9 had been considered in @xcite . in this case there is no exponential enhancement because the membrane reduces to a pair of kink and antikink , so there is no ` gas ' of massless excitations contributing to the free energy . for @xmath276",
