    "s3 , versus linear at long times as seen in fig .  3 of the main text ) .",
    "the absence of this effect is most probably due to the corresponding relaxation time being too long .",
    "this , in turn , is due to the small @xmath25-factor in our sample .",
    "based on the previous works @xcite , we estimate the spin inelastic relaxation time for the highest fields we used to be of the order of seconds .",

    "the fitting error of the extracted times @xmath118 , defined by the standard confidence interval @xmath119 , was below 1  % therefore , to make the error bars visible on fig .",

    "the fluctuations of individual tunneling times are caused by fluctuations of the inter - dot tunnel coupling , in turn due to the influence of implementing changes in @xmath72 , from deliberately changing gate voltages for other purposes in a related experiment,@xcite from the limited precision in setting the detuning @xmath12 to zero , and  probably the most importantly  from the drift of local voltages due to the 1/f noise ( it takes approximately 10 minutes to gather data for a single point in fig .",
    "except for @xmath12 , the above mentioned noise effects do not appreciably influence the ratio @xmath29 , since there the inter - dot tunnel coupling cancels out .",
    "the detuning is important if it , accidentally , matches the zeeman energy , at which value the @xmath5 anti - crosses with @xmath120 .",

    "we note that the transformation leaves the statistics of the random nuclear fields unchanged to all orders of @xmath176 , as a local rotation of a quantization axis is irrelevant for unpolarized spins ( only the correlators of distant spins are different in the original and transformed frame @xcite ) .    to calculate the matrix elements of the effective form of the spin - orbit interaction , eq .",

    "it is simple to show that the only non - zero dipole matrix elements within the single electron basis functions we consider are @xmath186 so that the orbital effects of the magnetic field are absent , apart from a small renormalization of the inter - dot overlap @xmath165 , which cancels in @xmath29 anyway . using this result",

    "is ( up to an overall phase coming from the phase convention of the spinors @xmath161 , @xmath162 ) @xmath187 this gives eq .",
    "( 2 ) upon identifying @xmath188 where we used eqs .  , and denoted the angle of the magnetic field with the @xmath173 axis as @xmath189 .",
    "this completes the derivation of eq .",
    "as described in the main text , since the form of the superoperator @xmath190 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is invariant to basis changes within the ( 11 ) sector , we choose a basis that diagonalizes the hamiltonian in this sector .",
    "this diagonalization results in a set of states @xmath47 , that are defined by @xmath191 , with @xmath192 the projector on the ( 11 ) subspace .",
    "it also results in off - diagonal elements given in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , which we treat perturbatively . assuming that initially the system is in such a state @xmath47 , we can neglect all other @xmath193 states in the lowest order of the time dependent perturbation theory , since the system can not make a direct tunneling @xmath194 , as there is no matrix element connecting these states .",
    "the only possible tunneling is to @xmath5 , the rate of which is described by a 2 by 2 time dependent hamiltonian @xmath195 in this notation , we define @xmath196 as the time average of the energy difference , and @xmath197 its temporal fluctuation , with spectral density defined analogously to eq .",
    "( 6 ) , @xmath198 assuming that the system is initially in state @xmath47 , and treating the off - diagonal terms in eq .   as a perturbation , in the leading order of a time dependent perturbation",
    "theory we get @xmath199 where we assumed @xmath200 ( that is , neglecting the initial oscillations which do not grow with time for long times ) , and @xmath201 with @xmath202 standing for principal value of the integral , and the approximation valid if the function @xmath203 is smooth on the scale @xmath204 .",
    "similarly @xmath205 if we assume that the principal value term is negligible , the transition rate from state @xmath47 to @xmath48 given in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , follows as @xmath206 from eq .  , with the charge decoherence rate given as the spectral density of energy fluctuations at zero frequency , eq .  .",
    "we also considered alternative explanations for the behavior of the observed rates .",
    "first of all , one might imagine that once the blocked tunneling becomes too slow , some other mechanism , unrelated to hyperfine or spin - orbit interactions and thus to the magnetic field , takes over in the electron spin relaxation .",
    "however , cotunneling , as the only realistic candidate for such a process we are aware of , is expected to result in rates well below the dot - lead rate of 1 hz which we measured in our dot .",
    "further , the data of fig .",
    "[ fig_s2](b ) show that the value of the blocked tunneling time is not correlated at all with the appearance and disappearance of the plateau in the ratio of the rates .",
    "second , we can extend our model to incorporate inelastic tunnelings by adding a noise term , e.g. , as a time dependent @xmath207 , into eq .",
    "it results in a contribution to the last term in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , through the spectral density @xmath208 , which is in general of a different functional form than the considered @xmath209 . before doing any quantitative estimates , we note that to explain the plateau in the ratio of the rates , the spectral density @xmath208 would have to be quadratic ( assuming the decoherence is low enough such that the lorentzian denominators cancel ) .",
    "we do not deem this to be a probable explanation , since neither of the electric noise sources which are considered relevant for spin relaxation has such spectral density .",
    "namely , the spectral density of phonons is cubic ( piezoelectric ) or @xmath210 ( deformation potential ) , the 1/f noise is inversely proportional to @xmath211 and the shot and thermal noise are frequency independent .",
    "in addition , the dipolar moment of the fluctuating electric field does not couple s(11 ) and s(02 ) .",
    "it only contributes to the decoherence , which our model already takes into account .",
    "we expect the sub - dominant ( beyond the dipole ) moments of the noise fields to be very small .",
    "third , we examined the possibility that such additional noise induces inelastic transitions within the ( 11 ) sector .",
    "a blocked triplet @xmath6 in such a scenario first decays to the s(11 ) and only then tunnels to s(02 ) , instead of making a spin - flip - assisted tunneling directly to s(02 ) .",
    "however , as derived in detail in the following subsection , we find that this leads to a decay described by @xmath212 , which we could clearly distinguish from an exponential decay @xmath213 which we observe for blocked tunnelings .        to examine the effects of inelastic transitions",
    ", we consider a rate equations model for three states , a polarized triplet denoted as @xmath47 , and the two singlets , @xmath8 and @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding occupation probabilities are denoted as @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 , respectively .",
    "they evolve according to        our minimal model therefore includes a decay of the triplet state into @xmath8 with relaxation rate @xmath219 and an unbiased equilibration of the two singlets with the rate @xmath220 , corresponding to the direct inter - dot tunneling @xmath221 .",
    "let us assume that at time @xmath105 the @xmath5 was not occupied , @xmath222 . for time interval @xmath18 short enough , @xmath223 , eqs .",
    "are solved by          now we supplement this evolution by an assumption that the detector measures the system repeatedly with a rate ( bandwidth ) @xmath226 , projecting it between @xmath16 and @xmath15 subspaces . assuming the system started in ( 11 ) subspace , the probability that no tunneling is observed up to time @xmath105 , @xmath227 , is governed by the equation",
