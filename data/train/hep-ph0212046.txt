    "statistical qcd predicts that with increasing temperature , strongly interacting matter will undergo a transition from a hadronic phase to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons . in the hadronic state , the chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian ( for massless quarks ) is spontaneously broken ; in the quark - gluon plasma",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is therefore necessary to determine under what conditions the initial state parton configurations can lead to color connection , and more specifically , if variations of the initial state can lead to a transition from disconnected to connected partonic clusters .",
    "the results of such a study of the pre - equilibrium state in nuclear collisions do not depend on the subsequent evolution and thus in particular not require any kind of thermalization .    the structural problem underlying the transition from disconnected to connected systems of many components is a very general one , ranging from clustering in spin systems to the formation of galaxies .",

    ", this overlap will lead to more and larger connected partonic clusters .",
    "the striking feature of this phenomenon is that the average cluster size @xmath38 does not grow as some power of @xmath39 ; instead , it increases very suddenly from very small to very large values ( see fig .  [ cluster ] ) .",
    "this suggests some kind of geometric critical behavior , and in fact in the ` thermodynamic limit ' @xmath40 , the cluster size diverges at a critical threshold value @xmath41 of the density @xmath39 , s_cl ~(n_c - n)^- , [ gamma ] as @xmath42 from below .",
    "this appearence of infinite clusters at @xmath43 is defined as percolation : the size of the cluster reaches the size of the system .",
    "the divergence is governed by the critical exponent @xmath44 , determined analytically , while the threshold n_c = 1.128 r^2 [ n - c ] is obtained numerically or through analytical approximation @xcite .",
    "hence we obtain in the limit of large systems = 1.128 r^2 [ perco - cond ] as percolation condition .",
    "note that because of parton overlap , the manifold is at percolation not totally covered by discs , even though the overall disc area slightly exceeds that of the manifold : @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , one can show that at @xmath43 , the fraction 1 - \\{-1.128 } 0.68 [ fraction ] of the area @xmath46 is covered by partonic discs .",
    "before we return to the study of nuclear collisions , we want to comment briefly on the relation between percolation and thermal phase transitions @xcite . some thermal critical behavior , such as the magnetization transition for ferromagnetic spin systems ,",
    "can be equivalently formulated as percolation",
    ". however , percolation seems to be a more general phenomenon and in particular can occur even when the partition function is analytic , i.e. , when there is no thermal critical behavior . a specific example of this is the ising model in a non - vanishing external field , which has a percolation transition even though there is no magnetization transition .",
    "the results of the previous subsection tell us that in nuclear collisions there is indeed , as function of parton density , a sudden onset of large - scale color connection .",
    "there is a critical density at which the partons form one large cluster , losing their independent existence and their relation to the parent nucleons .",
    "parton percolation @xcite is thus the onset of color deconfinement and although it is a necessary prerequisite for any subsequent qgp formation , it does not require or imply any kind of parton thermalization .    to obtain quantitative predictions",
    ", we have to specify the relevant scales .",
    "the partonic size is through the uncertainty relation determined by its average transverse momentum , r^2 , [ k - t ] and as mentioned , for a given resolution scale , @xmath47 . given the parton density in a nucleon , we now have to specify the density in a nucleus - nucleus collision . at sps energy ( @xmath48 gev )",

    "we thus find that for @xmath50 gev , there is percolation for @xmath51 , while for ( @xmath52 gev ) it sets in somewhat earlier , for @xmath53 .    0.5 cm    -0.4 cm    0.2 cm 0.5 cm    -0.4 cm    in the case of non - central @xmath49 collisions , the manifold disc size @xmath54 has to be replaced by the actual transverse overlap area at the given impact parameter",
    ". this overlap area can be determined in a glauber study , using woods - saxon nuclear profiles @xcite , and the resulting counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ perco ] ) then leads to figs .",
    "[ n - part ] . here",
    "the number @xmath55 of wounded or participant nucleons is used to specify the centrality of the collision , since this quantity is directly measurable . for @xmath56 collisions at @xmath57 gev ,",
    "this leads to an onset of percolation at @xmath58 ( corresponding to an impact parameter @xmath59 fm ) , while for @xmath60 at @xmath61 gev , @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 fm ) is the threshold .    0.5 cm    -0.4 cm    0.2 cm 0.5 cm",
    "-0.4 cm    beyond the percolation point , we then have a parton condensate , containing interacting and hence color - connected partons of all scales @xmath64 .",
    "the percolation point thus specifies the onset of color deconfinement ; it says nothing about any subsequent thermalization .",
    "if there is eventual thermalization , the partonic momentum @xmath8 will be related to the temperature @xmath65 ; hence the resolution scale @xmath17 , which determines the range of @xmath8 , is in some sense a precursor of @xmath65 .",
    "it is thus of interest to check how the percolation value @xmath66 is related to the effective nuclear size and to @xmath1 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ q - s - a ] for the @xmath0-dependence at two energies studied here . in the same figure , we also show the corresponding results as function of centrality at @xmath67 .",
    "it is seen that bigger @xmath1 , larger @xmath0 or more central collisions lead to a ` hotter ' parton condensate , in the mentioned pre - thermal sense .",
    "0.5 cm    -0.4 cm    0.2 cm 0.5 cm    -0.4 cm",
    "we have seen that in nuclear collisions , the parton structure of nucleons leads to critical behavior in the form of parton percolation in the transverse collision plane .",
    "this critical behavior is independent of any subsequent thermalization ; it is determined by the initial collision conditions in the pre - equilibrium stage .",
    "the parton condensate which is formed through percolation is closely related to the color glass condensate @xcite studied for nuclear collisions in the limit of large @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 ; the different approaches simply focus on different aspects . in percolation studies ,",
    "the central topic is the onset of parton condensation in terms of geometric critical behavior .",
    "in contrast , the color glass condensate describes the features of the high density limit for the pre - equilibrium partonic medium , in particular in terms of classical fields .",
    "the occurrence of geometric critical behavior in the pre - equilibrium stage of nuclear collisions can lead to observable consequences even if there never is any subsequent thermalization .",
    "we note here three possible effects of this kind : charmonium suppression , strangeness enhancement , and energy - independent hadronic source radii .",
    "charmonium states are formed very early in nuclear collisions , with a typical  formation time of some 0.2 - 0.3,fm obtained from binding energy or radius .",
    "this is also the time needed for the formation of the parton condensate , as determined by @xmath68 .",
    "the  thus finds itself in the non - equilibrium medium provided by the parton condensate .",
    "the typical scale of the charmonium state thus has to be compared to the intrinsic scale @xmath66 of the parton condensate .",
    "if the latter is indeed the precursor of temperature , it is also a precursor form of the screening mass .",
    "we will therefore assume a charmonium state @xmath21 of radius @xmath69 to be dissociated when @xmath70 .",
    "with r _ ( 0.9  gev)^-1 , r _ ( 0.6  gev)^-1 r _ ( 0.45  gev^-1 , [ radii]for the different subthreshold charmonium states , we then obtain the suppression values of @xmath66 shown in fig .",
    "[ supp ] .",
    "to see what these different suppression points imply for  production in nuclear collisions , we recall that in nucleon - nucleon collisions , s are produced in part through feed - down . only about 60% of the observed s",
    "are directly produced @xmath71 states ; of the remainder , about 30% come from @xmath72 and about 10% from   decay .",
    "since these decays occur very late in the collision evolution , the parton condensate ` sees ' and hence suppresses the different charmonium states in the given fractions . from fig .",
    "[ supp ] we thus expect that the survival probability of  s in @xmath56 collisions at the sps will show a first anomalous suppression step at about @xmath73 , since at this point the production fraction from @xmath72 and   decays is removed .",
    "a second drop would be expected around @xmath74 , since now the directly produced s are dissociated .",
    "the crucial consequence is the predicted two - step suppression pattern ; to obtain reliable numerical values clearly requires the inclusion of more details .",
    "in particular , the nuclear geometry , resulting in percolating and non - percolating ( ` hot ' vs.  ` cold ' ) regions in the transverse plane , has to be taken into account correctly in its effect on the suppression .",
    "a two - step suppression pattern was first obtained for  production in a quark - gluon plasma , since the different charmonium radii lead to dissociation for different screening radii .",
    "it now appears that in fact already pre - equilibrium parton condensation leads to a similar result , so that such a pattern , if observed , implies deconfinement but not the formation of a thermalized quark - gluon plasma .    in this connection",
    "we note also that the onset points for charmonium dissociation through parton condensation agree fairly well with the ` steps ' seen in the measured  survival probability ( see fig.[na50 ] ) . in view of the mentioned theoretical uncertainties and also because of possible kinematic suppression effects for very central collisions @xcite , this agreement should so far be considered in a more qualitative way",
    ". however , the observed threshold value for the onset of anomalous suppression measured in terms of the energy density is by more than a factor two above the energy density at deconfinement .",
    "this seems to support pre - equilibrium deconfinement through parton condensation as underlying mechanism .",
    "the relative abundance of the hadrons produced in high energy collisions , from nucleon - nucleon to heavy ion interactions , is well accounted for by an ideal gas of hadronic resonances @xcite the temperature of this gas converges at high energies to @xmath75 mev , i.e. , to the confinement temperature obtained in lattice qcd for low baryon density ( see fig .",
    "[ pavel ] for a compilation from nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite ) .",
    "the baryochemical potential depends on the baryon number content of the initial state , decreasing from values around @xmath76 gev in heavy ion collisions at the ags to near zero for @xmath77 and rhic heavy ion data .",
    "the only ` flaw ' in this picture is that in the elementary @xmath77 collisions one observes reduced strangeness production : the relative abundance of strange hadrons is reduced by a factor dependent only on its content of strange quarks / antiquarks .",
    "this strangeness suppression disappears for high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the dependence of strangeness abundance on the density of interacting hadrons can be accounted for if strangeness conservation is assumed to hold locally @xcite . in a thermal medium of temperature @xmath65 and overall volume @xmath78 , the relative phase space weight ( boltzmann factor ) for the presence of a strange particle of mass @xmath79",
    "is given by @xmath80 .",
    "if , however , the medium contains only one such strange particle , and if strangeness conservation is taken to hold locally within some correlation volume @xmath81 , then the correct boltzmann factor should be @xmath82 , since the simultaneous presence of the strange particle and its antiparticle requires the expenditure of energy @xmath83 .",
    "the crucial point here is the assumed local nature of strangeness conservation : the factor @xmath80 would be correct if the single strange particle could be compensated by a ` far away ' antiparticle somewhere else in the overall volume @xmath78 .",
    "it is only the requirement of zero strangeness within @xmath84 that leads to the enhanced suppression . since a given strange particle and its antiparticle in a really _ ideal",
    "_ gas will eventually separate beyond @xmath84 , the requirement of local strangeness conservation appearently implies the introduction of a dynamical ( i.e. , non - ideal ) correlation .    to illustrate the effect of this phenomenon",
    ", we consider the abundance of kaons in a hadron gas .",
    "given the ideal gas density of kaons , @xmath85 , local strangeness conservation leads to the suppressed form n_k(t , x ) = n_k(t)\\{i_1(x ) i_0(x ) } , [ gc ] where @xmath86 specifies the number of kaons inside the correlation volume @xmath84 ; @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the corresponding bessel and hankel functions of imaginary argument . in the limit of high density or large correlation volume , @xmath89 ,",
    "@xmath90 , and the ideal gas abundances are correct . for low density or small correlation volume , i.e. , for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , thus resulting in an effective strangeness suppression as compared to the ideal gas abundance of kaons ( see fig .  [ local ] ) .",
    "we are thus confronted with the puzzling question of how the transition from suppressed to normal strangeness production occurs .",
    "what specifies the correlation volume @xmath84 ?",
    "a rather natural solution to this puzzle is that the abundance of strange hadrons is already determined by the initial state partonic cluster size in the transverse plane : the extension of this cluster specifies @xmath84 .",
    "this means that parton percolation and the corresponding sudden increase of @xmath84 result in @xmath93 and thus trigger the transition to genuine ideal gas abundances of strange particles .",
    "more detailed work on this is in progress ; an interesting aspect is obviously the resulting correspondence between charmonium suppression and strangeness enhancement .",
    "this point is undoubtedly the most speculative of the present considerations . at various stages of the high energy heavy ion program",
    ", it has been asked whether a single collision event already produces a thermal medium ( ` matter ' ) , or whether each individual event is something like one member of a gibbs ensemble in thermodynamics , so that only an average over many events results in a thermal pattern .",
    "if we take the extreme point of view that the observable phenomena are determined fully determined by the initial state parton configuration of the colliding nuclei , without any subsequent thermalization , then a single collision does not lead to a thermodynamic medium .",
    "everything is specified by the given nuclear collision configuration , and there will in particular not be any kind of ` expanding and cooling matter ' .",
    "this suggests that the source size as determined by hbt interferometry should essentially measure the initial nuclear collision configuration ; it should show no dependence on the collision energy and not lead to any ` medium life - time ' , with always @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , the transverse expansion velocity should also become constant with increasing collison energy .",
    "these features are indeed observed , as shown in figs .",
    "[ pavel ] and [ hbt ] , contrary to all earlier predictions",
    ".    perhaps there exist models which nevertheless can reproduce the entire set of present observations in thermal terms .",
    "however , it does seem worthwhile to pursue further the possibility that initial state conditions alone already determine them rather naturally , and to search for some crucial additional observable which would unambiguously indicate event - by - event thermalization ."
