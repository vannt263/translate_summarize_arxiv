    "<S> we examine in details the connections between topological and entanglement properties of short - range resonating valence bond ( rvb ) wave functions using projected entangled pair states ( peps ) on kagome and square lattices on ( quasi-)infinite cylinders with generalized boundary conditions ( and perimeters with up to 20 lattice spacings ) . making use of disconnected topological sectors in the space of dimer lattice coverings , we explicitly derive ( orthogonal )  </S>",
    "<S> minimally entangled \" peps rvb states . for the kagome lattice , using the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet as a reference model , we obtain the finite size scaling with increasing cylinder perimeter of the vanishing energy separations between these states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we extract two separate ( vanishing ) energy scales corresponding ( i ) to insert a vison line between the two ends of the cylinder and ( ii ) to pull out and freeze a spin at either end . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the relations between bulk and boundary properties and show that , for a bipartition of the cylinder , the boundary hamiltonian defined on the edge can be written as a product of a highly non - local projector , which fundamentally depends upon boundary conditions , with an emergent ( local ) @xmath0-invariant one - dimensional ( superfluid ) t  j hamiltonian , which arises due to the symmetry properties of the auxiliary spins at the edge . </S>",
    "<S> this multiplicative structure , a consequence of the disconnected topological sectors in the space of dimer lattice coverings , is characteristic of the topological nature of the states . for minimally entangled rvb states , it is shown that the entanglement spectrum , which reflects the properties of the ( gapless or gapped ) edge modes , is a subset of the spectrum of the local hamiltonian , e.g. half of it for the kagome rvb state , providing a simple argument on the origin of the topological entanglement entropy @xmath1 of the @xmath2 spin liquid . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to use these features to probe topological phases in microscopic hamiltonians and some results are compared to existing dmrg data . </S>"
