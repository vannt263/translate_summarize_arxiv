    "understanding the processes that halt the exponential growth of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; @xcite ) and set the rate of angular momentum transport in the turbulent regime has been an outstanding problem in accretion physics for almost two decades .",

    "saturation of the mri may be related to secondary ( parasitic ) instabilities ( * ? ? ? * hereafter gx94 ) that feed upon the free energy afforded by the mri ( see , e.g. , @xcite for alternative ideas ) .",
    "these instabilities are often invoked to explain some of the behavior observed in numerical simulations .",
    "the absence of explicit dissipation from most numerical studies and from gx94 s analysis , however , impedes quantitative interpretations .",
    "both primary and secondary instabilities may be subject to non - ideal effects .",
    "the growth rates and wavenumbers of the fastest growing mri primaries , and the relative orientations and magnitudes of their velocity and magnetic field perturbations , are sensitive to dissipation coefficients ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "viscosity may slow the growth of the kelvin - helmholtz secondaries identified by gx94 , and non - zero resistivity may enable resistive instabilities such as tearing modes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    here",
    "we summarize a parametric study of parasitic instabilities in dissipative regimes accessible to current numerical simulations .",
    "we adopt the incompressible limit , which is relevant for initial fields so weak that saturation occurs with sub - equipartition fields .",
    "the fastest growing , non - ideal parasitic modes are related to kelvin - helmholtz and tearing - mode instabilities .",
    "they are non - axisymmetric and have horizontal wavelengths roughly a factor of 2 larger than the vertical wavelength of the primary mri mode .",
    "our findings suggest that current simulation domains may bias the saturation of the non - ideal mri by excluding the fastest mri and parasitic modes ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "to facilitate our analysis of the stability of the non - ideal mri modes against parasitic instabilities , we invoke some approximations similar to those adopted by gx94 for ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "we assume that the amplitudes of the primary modes are large enough that we can neglect the influence of the weak vertical background field , the coriolis force , and the background shear flow on the dynamics of the secondary modes .",

    "their parameter @xmath57 is a proxy for the plasma @xmath58 parameter in a stratified disk with equivalent height @xmath59 ( in our units @xmath60 ) . setting @xmath61 , as in ll07",
    ", it follows that the values for @xmath55 cited above correspond to @xmath62 .",
    "note that these are rather small .",
    "we solved equations ( [ eq : linear_sys_nu ] ) and ( [ eq : linear_sys_eta ] ) for all the possible combinations of the set of values of @xmath28 and @xmath63 defined above and searched the parameter space defined by @xmath64 in order to identify the most relevant , fastest growing secondary modes .",
    "we have not been able to find unstable parasitic modes with @xmath65 .",
    "this result generalizes the findings of gx94 to the non - ideal mhd regime .",
    "the secondary modes will be clearly dynamically important when their growth rates are comparable to , or greater than , the growth rates of the primary modes upon which they feed .",
    "we refer to this instance as the `` saturation '' of the primary mri mode .",
    "it is then convenient to define the saturation amplitude @xmath66 as the amplitude that the magnetic field produced by the mri must have grown to in order for the instantaneous growth rate of the fastest parasitic mode , @xmath67 , to match that of the primary , @xmath68 .    in the ideal limit ,",
    "the growth rate of the secondary modes derived from equations ( [ eq : linear_sys_nu ] ) and ( [ eq : linear_sys_eta ] ) is linear in the amplitude of the primary magnetic field ( gx94 ) .",
    "thus , the amplitude @xmath69 at which the growth rate of the fastest secondary equals the growth rate of a given primary mode can be estimated after solving these equations with @xmath70 .",
    "however , in the non - ideal case the amplitude @xmath69 can not be scaled out of the problem , and the growth rate of the secondary modes depends on it in a non - trivial way .",
    "figure [ fig : max_growths ] shows the fastest growth rates @xmath71 of various secondary modes that feed off the fastest primary mri mode for three combinations of @xmath28 and @xmath63 , with curves for several values of @xmath72 . in all of the cases shown , @xmath73 , i.e. , the amplitude of the primary mri mode is such that the fastest secondary growth rate , @xmath74 .    for all the cases within the explored dissipative regime , the fastest parasitic modes are non - axisymmetric ( @xmath75 ) ,",
    "have the same vertical periodicity as the primary mode ( @xmath76 ) , and have purely real growth rates .",
    "the fastest modes have horizontal wavevectors that are nearly aligned with either the velocity or the magnetic field of the primary ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) .",
    "the first type are clearly related to kelvin - helmholtz instabilities while the latter are related to tearing modes .",
    "the ratio between the horizontal wavenumber of the fastest parasitic mode , @xmath79 , and the wavenumber of the fastest mri mode is rather insensitive to either @xmath28 or @xmath63 ; @xmath80 varies from 0.59 , in ideal mhd , to 0.46 , in the cases with highest viscosity and resistivity .",
    "we calculate the dimensionless stress at saturation as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , is the sum of the reynolds and maxwell stresses @xmath83 these expressions are integrated to obtain the dimensionless stress @xmath84 in terms of the parameter @xmath58 , @xmath85 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the left panel of figure [ fig : alpha_sat ] shows @xmath84 in the case where both primary and secondary instabilities evolve unimpeded .",
    "there are competitive effects that set the value of @xmath84 , which is dominated by the maxwell stress .",
    "as dissipation increases , the saturation amplitude @xmath86 increases from @xmath87 , in ideal mhd , to @xmath88 , in the cases with high dissipation .",
    "however , the angle @xmath89 decreases toward @xmath90 , so that @xmath91 decreases .",
    "both effects roughly compensate each other so that the final value of @xmath84 changes only by a factor of 2 .",
    "therefore , for the range of dissipation coefficients that we explored , the saturation amplitude of the primary modes should be insensitive to the dissipation coefficients if both the fastest primary and secondary instabilities are permitted .",
    "the value of @xmath84 does not depend on @xmath63 for large @xmath28 , and the range of @xmath63 for which the results do not depend on @xmath63 seems to increase with @xmath28 .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : alpha_sat ] shows @xmath84 when the primary and secondary modes considered are the fastest mri and parasitic modes that can fit in a domain @xmath92 with @xmath61 , as considered in ll07 .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is to emulate the situation in which a finite simulation domain might constrain the availability of primary and/or secondary modes .",
    "the dependence of @xmath84 on the dimensionless numbers @xmath93 is modified with respect to the case where there are no limitations on the range of primary or secondary modes ; @xmath84 decreases with decreasing @xmath63 for a wider range of @xmath28 .",
    "this trend is similar to that observed by ll07 , but the dependence on @xmath63 is less pronounced and the predicted value of @xmath84 is smaller than that found in non - linear simulations ( by a factor of 6 at @xmath94 ) .",
    "most of the differences in @xmath84 associated with domain size are due to the limitations on the primaries .",
    "although the fastest secondaries do not fit in the domain , there are other secondary modes with comparable growth rates that can lead to `` saturation '' at slightly larger primary amplitudes .",
    "we have investigated the spectrum of parasitic instabilities that feed off the mri in viscous , resistive mhd , focusing our attention on the parameter space currently accessible to numerical simulations .",
    "our study suggests that important differences between two - dimensional and three - dimensional simulations are to be expected .",
    "the fastest parasitic modes are non - axisymmetric and have the same vertical periodicity as the primary upon which they feed .",
    "they tend to have wavevectors that are almost aligned with the velocity or magnetic fields generated by the mri .",
    "as we will detail in a separate paper , the fastest parasitic instabilities can be roughly grouped into kelvin - helmholtz and tearing mode instabilities . the first type feed off the sinusoidal velocity field of the mri and",
    "are quenched when the viscosity is increased . the second feed off the mri currents and are enabled by resistivity .",
    "the values of @xmath84 that result from the rather crude procedure that we followed to find the amplitudes of the mri fields at saturation are similar , within factors of a few , to the values obtained from numerical simulations in the turbulent regime .",
    "our results suggest , however , that the saturation amplitude of the mri may not be well determined if the simulation domain limits the available primary and secondary modes .",
    "the domains should be large enough vertically to accommodate the fastest primary mode , i.e. , @xmath95 , and should have aspect ratios that allow the fastest parasitic modes , i.e. , @xmath96 ( see  [ sec : saturation ] ) .",
    "@xmath97 ll07 carried out a series of shearing box simulations in incompressible mhd with explicit dissipation .",
    "for the range of parameters that they explored , @xmath98 , the stress at saturation decreases with decreasing magnetic prandtl number .",
    "a weak dependence on the reynolds number can not be discounted . for several of the runs ,",
    "the most unstable mri mode does not fit within the numerical domain , and neither do the fastest parasitic modes .",
    "it is worth asking whether the observed trends of @xmath84 with @xmath63 and @xmath55 might be biased by these constraints .",
    "@xmath97 @xcite explored viscous effects in two - dimensional simulations .",
    "in several cases , `` saturation '' is not achieved since the turbulent stresses are still increasing at the end of the runs .",
    "two different effects might be playing a role in the observed behavior .",
    "axisymmetric parasitic modes grow at only a fraction of the rate of the fastest non - axisymmetric modes .",
    "kelvin - helmholtz parasites are further slowed by viscosity .",
    "therefore , the mri field needs to grow to higher amplitudes before the secondary instabilities can compete with the most unstable ( available ) primary mode .",
    "@xmath97 @xcite exposed a dependence of saturation on the aspect ratio of the simulation domain .",
    "they found that the saturated stresses decrease when @xmath99 varies from 1 to 4 , and found less significant differences between aspect ratios 4 and 8 .",
    "we have shown that even in non - ideal mhd , the fastest parasitic modes have horizontal wavelengths roughly twice as large as the vertical wavelength of the dominant primary mri mode .",
    "it is tempting to attribute bodo et al s ( 2008 ) results to the exclusion of parasitic modes at the @xmath100 aspect ratio .",
    "while this letter was in draft form , we learned of the investigations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter llb09 ) , which are similar to our own .",
    "a brief comparison of methods and conclusions is in order .",
    "both studies generalize gx94 to resistive mhd and characterize the types and growth rates of the non - ideal parasitic modes .",
    "llb09 neglect viscous effects , which we include , but supplement their analysis with direct numerical simulations .",
    "a major conclusion of both studies is that parasitic modes can be limited by the size of the simulation domain .",
    "thus box size may be as important as numerical resolution for the saturation of the mri .",
    "llb09 ultimately conclude , however , that parasitic modes are unimportant for two reasons .",
    "first , they suggest that parasites should `` overtake '' the primaries only when the latter reach large non - linear amplitudes , and then the gas behaves compressibly .",
    "we have shown that the secondary modes become dynamically important when the mri magnetic field is of the order of a few times the vertical field .",
    "therefore , we argue that if the initial vertical field is sufficiently weak , then the parasites can erupt before the magnetic pressure approaches the gas pressure , although this regime is expensive to simulate with compressible codes .",
    "second , llb09 find that in large boxes  where parasitic modes are possible ",
    "channel modes emerging from the turbulent regime do not reach large amplitudes ; they conclude that something other than parasitic modes must be responsible for their disruption .",
    "this may be true , although we suggest another explanation below .",
    "while llb09 speculate about multi - mode interactions , they offer no definite or calculable alternative to parasitic modes . at present , the properties of parasitic modes provide the only analytical guidance , other than the linear mri dispersion relation , to the choice of dimensions for incompressible or weak - field simulations .",
    "the numerical simulations seem to suggest that the primary modes reach higher amplitudes than predicted in section [ sec : saturation ] .",
    "perhaps terms neglected from equations ( [ eq : linear_sys_nu ] ) and ( [ eq : linear_sys_eta ] ) delay the onset of the secondary instabilities by reducing their growth rates .",
    "alternatively , saturation may occur not when the secondaries achieve the same growth rate as the primary , but when they achieve the same amplitude .",
    "the latter occurs later when the mri develops from a quiet start .",
    "let @xmath101 be the time at which the growth rates match , when the primary has amplitude @xmath102 .",
    "the instantaneous parasitic growth rate @xmath103\\gamma_{\\rm max } $ ] for @xmath104 .",
    "suppose that the fastest parasite begins with amplitude @xmath105 relative to the primary at @xmath101 .",
    "then when secondary and primary amplitudes match , at a later time @xmath106 , the primary has grown by a factor @xmath107 .",
    "that is , the equal - amplitude criterion predicts a saturation amplitude larger by @xmath108 compared to our previous equal - growth - rate criterion .",
    "llb09 seeded their simulations with small but unspecified noise , which set the initial amplitude of the parasites . if @xmath109 then the overshoot factor @xmath110 . in the fully turbulent regime",
    ", the parasites would start from a larger amplitude , say @xmath111 , leading to a smaller overshoot @xmath112 .",
    "channel modes are then less prominent in the turbulent state because of this smaller peak amplitude as well as the larger background of other modes .",
    "further numerical investigations should shed light on these issues ."
