    "multipair multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) relaying networks have recently attracted considerable attention since they can provide a cost - effective way of achieving performance gains in wireless systems via coverage extension and maintaining a uniform quality of service .",
    "in such a system , multiple sources simultaneously exchange information with multiple destinations via a shared multiple - antenna relay in the same time - frequency resource .",
    "hence , multi - user interference is the primary system bottleneck .",
    "the deployment of massive antenna arrays at the relay has been proposed to address this issue due to their ability to suppress interference , provide large array and spatial multiplexing gains , and in turn to yield large improvements in spectral and energy efficiency @xcite .",
    "there has recently been considerable research interest in multipair massive mimo relaying systems . for example",
    ", @xcite derived the ergodic rate of the system when maximum ratio combining / maximum ratio transmission ( mrc / mrt ) beamforming is employed and showed that the energy efficiency gain scales with the number of relay antennas in rayleigh fading channels .",
    "then , @xcite extended the analysis to the ricean fading case and obtained similar power scaling behavior . for full - duplex systems ,",
    "@xcite analytically compared the performance of mrc / mrt and zero - forcing reception / transmission and characterized the impact of the number of user pairs on the spectral efficiency .",
    "all the aforementioned works are based on the assumption of perfect hardware .",
    "however , a large number of antennas at the relay implies a very large deployment cost and significant energy consumption if a separate rf chain is implemented for each antenna in order to maintain full beamforming flexibility . in particular ,",
    "the fabrication cost , chip area and power consumption of the analog - to - digital converters ( adcs ) and the digital - to - analog converters ( dacs ) grow roughly exponentially with the number of quantization bits @xcite .",
    "the cumulative cost and power required to implement a relay with a very large array can be prohibitive , and thus it is desirable to investigate the use of cheaper and more energy - efficient components , such as low - resolution ( e.g. , one bit ) adcs and dacs .",
    "fortunately , it has been shown in @xcite that large arrays exhibit a certain resilience to rf hardware impairments that could be caused by such low - cost components .",
    "several recent contributions have investigated the impact of low - resolution adcs on the massive mimo uplink @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite optimized the training pilot length to maximize the spectral efficiency , while @xcite revealed that in terms of overall energy efficiency , the optimal level of quantization is 4 - 5 bits . in @xcite ,",
    "the bussgang decomposition @xcite was used to reformulate the nonlinear quantization using a second - order statistically equivalent linear operator , and to derive a linear minimum mean - squared error ( lmmse ) channel estimator for one - bit adcs . in @xcite ,",
    "a near - optimal low complexity bit allocation scheme was presented for millimeter wave channels exhibiting sparsity .",
    "the work of @xcite examined the impact of one - bit adcs on wideband channels with frequency - selective fading .",
    "other work has focused on balancing the spectral and energy efficiency , either through the combined use of hybrid architectures with a small number of rf chains and low resolution adcs , or using mixed adcs architectures with high and low resolution .",
    "in contrast to the uplink case , there are relatively fewer contributions that consider the massive mimo downlink with low - resolution dacs . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that performance approaching the unquantized case can be achieved using dacs with only 3 - 4 bits of resolution .",
    "the nearly optimal quantized wiener precoder with low - resolution dacs was studied in @xcite , and the resulting solution was shown to outperform the conventional wiener precoder with 4 - 6 bits of resolution at high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . for the case of one - bit dacs , @xcite showed that even simple mrt precoding can achieve reasonable results .",
    "in @xcite , an lmmse precoder was proposed by taking the quantization non - linearities into account , and different precoding schemes were compared in terms of uncoded bit error rate .",
    "all these prior works are for single - hop systems rather than dual - hop connections via a relay .",
    "recently , @xcite considered a relay - based system that uses mixed - resolution adcs at the base station .",
    "unlike @xcite , we consider a multipair amplify - and - forward ( af ) relaying system where the relay uses both one - bit adcs and one - bit dacs .",
    "the one - bit adcs cause errors in the channel estimation stage and subsequently in the reception of the uplink data ; then , after a linear transformation , the one - bit dacs produce distortion when the downlink signal is coarsely quantized . in this paper , we present a detailed performance investigation of the achievable rate of such doubly quantized systems . in particular , the main contributions are summarized as follows :    * we investigate a multipair af relaying system that employs one - bit adcs and dacs at the relay and uses mrc / mrt beamforming to process the signals .",
    "we take the correlation of the quantization noise into account , and present an exact achievable rate by using the arcsine law .",
    "then , we use asymptotic arguments to provide an approximate closed - form expression for the achievable rate .",
    "numerical results demonstrate that the approximate rate is accurate in typical massive mimo scenarios , even with only a moderate number of users .",
    "* we show that the channel estimation accuracy of the quantized system depends on the specific orthogonal pilot matrix that is used , which is in contrast to unquantized systems where any orthogonal pilot sequence yields the same result .",
    "we consider the specific case of identity and hadamard pilot matrices , and we show that the identity training scheme provides better channel estimation performance for users with weaker than average channels , while the hadamard training sequence is better for users with stronger channels .",
    "* we compare the achievable rate of different adc and dac configurations , and show that a system with one - bit dacs and perfect adcs outperforms a system with one - bit adcs and perfect dacs . focusing on the low transmit power regime , we show that the sum rate of the relay system with one - bit adcs and dacs is @xmath0 times that achievable with perfect adcs and dacs .",
    "also , it is shown that the transmit power of each source or the relay can be reduced inversely proportional to the number of relay antennas , while maintaining a given quality - of - service .",
    "* we formulate a power allocation problem to allocate power to each source and the relay , subject to a sum power budget .",
    "locally optimum solutions are obtained by solving a sequence of geometric programming ( gp ) problems .",
    "our numerical results suggest that the power allocation strategy can efficiently compensate for the rate degradation caused by the coarse quantization .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system_model ] introduces the multipair af relaying system model under consideration .",
    "section [ sec : rate_analysis ] presents an approximate closed - form expression for the sum rate , and compares the rate achieved with different adc and dac configurations .",

    "the relay is equipped with @xmath29 receive antennas with one - bit adcs and @xmath29 transmit antennas with one - bit dacs .",
    "the one - bit adcs cause errors in the channel estimation stage and subsequently in the reception of the uplink data ; then , after a linear transformation , the one - bit dacs produce distortion when the downlink signal is coarsely quantized .",
    "thus , the system we study is double quantized .",
    "we assume that direct links between @xmath30 and @xmath27 do not exist due to large obstacles or severe shadowing .",

    "afterwards , all destinations simultaneously transmit their mutually orthogonal pilot sequences @xmath56 satisfying @xmath57 to the relay while the sources remain silent .",
