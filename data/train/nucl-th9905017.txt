    "<S> the proton optical potentials are taken from cooper _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are several sets of optical potentials available , some of which are energy dependent ( e  dep ) and constructed from a fit to data for a specific nucleus , such as @xmath0 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , in the proton kinetic energy range of @xmath39 25 @xmath40 to 1 @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> other potentials are parameterized in terms of target mass as well as proton energy ( e+a  dep ) and can be used to generate potentials for which no proton elastic scattering data exist . </S>",
    "<S> we shall perform calculations using both types of potentials .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are compared in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 with the non - relativistic eei calculations of ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath16 and @xmath2 used in the non - relativistic calculations were provided to us by kelly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our values of @xmath16 and @xmath2 are consistent with those used in the non - relativistic calculations if we ignore the electron mass . for the @xmath4 case , </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , the relativistic calculations provide a slight improvement over the non - relativistic results . </S>",
    "<S> this is true for both types of optical potentials used in the relativistic calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the differences between relativistic and non - relativistic calculations are accentuated at higher missing momenta . </S>",
    "<S> there are also differences at very small @xmath19 , with the relativistic model providing a 10% smaller polarization at missing momenta around 20 mev / c .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculations for @xmath5 proton knockout are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is more evident in this case that the relativistic calculations provide better agreement with the data , particularly at large missing momenta . </S>",
    "<S> ( they are also better than the non - relativistic calculations using the edaic potential reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but not shown here ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most prominent feature here is that the non - relativistic calculations with the eei potential produce a large negative polarization in the region @xmath19 = 250 - 300 </S>",
    "<S> mev / c . </S>",
    "<S> the edaic potential produces a shallower minimum in the same region . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast the relativistic calculations indicate that the minimum would be at missing momenta larger than 300 mev / c . </S>",
    "<S> because of the large size of the error bars for the data points at the largest missing momenta , the behaviour of the polarization is not well constrained in this region , but the relativistic calculations seem to be following the trend of the data somewhat better than the results of the non - relativistic model .    </S>",
    "<S> sensitivity to changes in the binding potentials has been examined by performing calculations using both dirac hartree and woods - saxon binding potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the hartree potentials result in a binding energy that is slightly smaller than the experimental value . </S>",
    "<S> the woods - saxon potentials reproduce the experimental binding energy and also provide an @xmath42 radius for the bound state that is within one percent of that found from the hartree potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we find little difference between the two binding potentials for the region of missing momenta considered in the present study . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs because the momentum - space wave functions for these bound states are very similar in the low momentum region explored in these kinematics .    </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the issue here is not one of final state interactions , since we are using the same potentials used by woo _ at al._. </S>",
    "<S> the issue is the difference between results arising in the relativistic and non - relativistic treatments of these reactions . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus shown that the relativistic calculations appear capable of achieving better agreement with the nucleon polarization data than the non - relativistic ones . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with observations made earlier in polarized nucleon scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also note a hint of large differences between the two calculations at large missing momenta . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the advisability of pushing the measurements further into the high missing momentum region . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that such measurements would strongly test both models and also clarify the role , if any , of two body currents in these reactions . </S>"
