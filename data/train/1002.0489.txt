    "lisa ( laser interferometer space antenna ) is a joint space mission by esa and nasa which is planned to be launched at the end of the next decade .",
    "it consists of three identical free - falling satellites , orbiting around the sun and marking the vertices of a nearly equilateral triangle with @xmath0 km ( 1/30 au ) sides , located @xmath1 behind the earth and lying in a plane that makes an angle of @xmath2 with the ecliptic @xcite .",
    "lisa target is the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) through the measure of the relative and differential motions between the spacecrafts . among the astrophysical goals of lisa",
    "is to detect gws originated by events like black holes coalescence or capture of compact objects by black holes @xcite .",
    "this requires a strain sensitivity of @xmath3 in the @xmath4 to @xmath5 hz frequency band range .",
    "however , lisa reference masses interact also with time - dependent ( e.g. planets and their satellites , quadrupolar pulsation of the sun , etc . ) and static ( e.g. i d and ldm ) local gravitational fields , and therefore they depart from ideal unperturbed orbits around the sun . in this paper , we focused on the perturbing effects caused by the static components i d and ldm . as the discriminating feature between i d and ldm concerns only their coupling with the electromagnetic field , we expect that i d and ldm will produce similar gravitational forces on reference masses .",
    "in fact , only i d reflects the solar light and can be studied through observations of zodiacal light @xcite , while ldm is  dark \" and its presence can be investigated by means of gravitational perturbations induced on orbiting bodies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that other possibilities for detection of dm are the searches for particular electro - weak processes beyond the standard model at particle colliders .",
    "thus we assume that i d and ldm induce identical gravitational effects on lisa orbits , with the irrelevant difference that the first is luminous and the second is dark .",
    "as we will show , the linear perturbation theory holds , being other gravitational forces acting on lisa reference masses much smaller than the sun pull ; under this approximation , small perturbations to ideal keplerian motions induced by different sources in the solar system can be studied separately .",
    "the i d cloud is a dust composed by grains with typical sizes of @xmath6 m pervading the solar system .",
    "the distribution of i d particles is studied by the observations of solar light scattering ( i.e. the zodiacal light confined to the ecliptic plane ) and by their thermal emission , which is the dominant component of night - sky light in the @xmath7 m wavelength @xcite .",
    "physical models of i d density distribution @xmath8 should account for its symmetries , that can be easily described in the solar system baricentric ( ssb ) reference frame @xmath9 : i ) invariance under rotation about the @xmath10 axis , and ii ) invariance under reflections in the @xmath11 ecliptic plane .",
    "usually one also assumes a static distribution and a power - law radial profile . as a consequence ,",
    "all the proposed models factorize @xmath8 into two functions @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the distance from the sun , @xmath14 is the helioecliptic latitude , @xmath15 kg/@xmath16 is the density value at @xmath17 au ( earth s orbit ) , as estimated by the integration of the meteoroid mass distribution far away from the earth , in order to avoid its gravitational attraction on i d particles , and @xmath18 is a given function .",
    "the typical value of the parameter @xmath19 , determined from zodiacal light photometer measurements on helios 1 and 2 @xcite , is @xmath20 .",
    "the expression of @xmath21 is still uncertain ; however , the analytical formula which best reproduces the observations of zodiacal light is the so - called _ ellipsoid model _ @xmath22^{\\alpha/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes of an oblate ellipsoid respectively . beyond @xmath26 au in the ecliptic plane and @xmath27 au off the ecliptic plane",
    ", no reliable density values can be obtained from the zodiacal light .",
    "therefore we assume @xmath28 au and @xmath29 au for the semi - axes and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that the total i d mass amount inside the considered region is of the order of @xmath31 kg , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "the ellipsoid model of i d density depends on two parameters , @xmath19 and @xmath33 , and , in order to numerically study gravitational effects of i d on lisa orbits , we will consider four cases : i ) _ spherical homogeneous distribution _",
    "( @xmath34 ) , ii ) _ spherical distribution with power - law density profile _ ( @xmath35 ) , iii ) _ ellipsoidal homogeneous distribution _ ( @xmath36 ) , and iv ) _ ellipsoidal distribution with power - law density profile _ ( @xmath37 .",
    "as the first step we define the unperturbed lisa orbits .",

    "this requirement must be fulfilled in order to operate lisa successfully .",

    "i d harmonic ) , is required to achieve a unitary signal - to - noise ratio ( snr = @xmath116 . ) in a 5 years observation time . however , in the literature there exist extrapolations of the strain sensitivity @xmath117 only up to @xmath118 hz @xcite and the measure of such a small signal amplitude depends on the noise level of lisa at very low frequencies ( @xmath119 hz ) , which is still largely unknown .",
    "we have calculated the i d perturbing effects on the lisa differential motions . using the estimated i d density , we found a continuous opening of the lisa orbits of the order of @xmath87 m after 5 years at @xmath120 frequency .",
    "moreover , due to the particular lisa orbits , which are nearly circular and very close to the ecliptic plane , we found similar effects for the distributions we have taken into account .",
    "in fact , the i d tidal forces vary significantly over a scale much larger than the lisa triangle sides .",

    "thus we can account for ldm just by a rescale of @xmath122 : for instance , if we assume that the ldm density value is close to the average galactic dark matter ( gdm ) density value , @xmath123 as obtained from the galaxy rotation curve , the effect of dm is expected to be 0.5% that of i d .    as a consequence",
    ", lisa could provide interesting upper limits on both @xmath124 and @xmath125 , depending on low frequencies noise and @xmath126 value , by means of direct gravitational field measurements instead of observations of zodiacal light in the case of i d . at present time , the best upper limits @xmath127 kg/@xmath16 are based on the study of the precession of the perihelions of mercury , earth and mars @xcite .",
    "however , we stress that a thorough study of lisa displacement noise below @xmath128hz , including local gravitational field fluctuations , thruster noise , orbit determination and injection errors @xcite etc . , is required to establish the relevance of the i d effects in lisa physics .",
    "the study of the solar system gravitational field acting on lisa reference masses is of some relevance also for the detection of gws . in fact , the non - radiative gravitational perturbations on lisa keplerian motions must be subtracted at the highest accuracy from the relative differential motion in order to measure the gw contributions . in this paper",
    "we have calculated the time evolutions of the orbital parameters due to some i d distributions and estimated the opening induced on the lisa constellation , @xmath129 m after 5 years .",
    "the fourier transform of the perturbation of the differential relative motion has shown an enhancement of the resonances characterizing the unperturbed spectra , in particular the peak at @xmath120 frequency . as a consequence of the lisa orbits ,",
    "such effects are similar for the studied distributions of i d and do not affect the lisa sensitivity band for gw detection .",
    "on the other hand , the discrimination of very small perturbations from the keplerian differential relative motion depends crucially on the low frequency displacement noise , that in the ideal case should be @xmath130 at @xmath120 frequency to detect i d at the density @xmath131 measured by the zodiacal light .",
    "unfortunately , a reliable estimate of this noise level at very low frequency is still lacking and requires futher investigations .",
    "finally , we investigate the possibility of constraining the ldm density with lisa",
