    "the interest on the properties of open and hidden charm mesons was initiated in the context of heavy - ion collisions in connection to the charmonium suppression @xcite as a probe for the formation of quark - gluon plasma .",
    "recently charmed baryonic resonances have received a lot of attention motivated by the discovery of quite a few new states by the cleo , belle and babar collaborations @xcite . moreover",
    ", the future fair facility at gsi @xcite will move from the light quark sector to the heavy one and will face new challenges where charm plays a dominant role .",
    "the cbm ( compressed baryonic matter ) experiment at fair / gsi will extend the gsi programme for in - medium modification of hadrons in the light quark sector , and provide first insight into the charm - nucleus interaction .",
    "therefore , the modifications of the properties of open and hidden charm mesons in a hot and dense environment are being the focuss of recent studies .    the in - medium modification of the properties of open - charm mesons ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 may help to explain the @xmath4 suppression in a hadronic environment as well as the possible formation of @xmath2-mesic nuclei .",
    "moreover , changes in the properties of open - charm mesons will affect the renormalization of charm and hidden charm scalar meson resonances in nuclear matter , providing information about their nature .",
    "in the present paper we obtain the properties of open - charm mesons in dense matter within a self - consistent approach in coupled channels .",
    "we study the behaviour of dynamically generated charmed baryonic resonances as well as the open - charm meson spectral functions in this dense medium .",
    "we then analyze the effect of the self - energy of @xmath2 mesons on the properties of dynamically - generated charm and hidden charm scalar resonances , such as the @xmath0 and the predicted @xmath1 resonances .",
    "we finally provide some recent results on @xmath2-nucleus bound states .",
    "the self - energy and , hence , the spectral function for open - charm ( @xmath2 and @xmath5 ) mesons is obtained following a self - consistent coupled - channel procedure .",
    "the transition potential of the bethe - salpeter equation or @xmath6-matrix ( @xmath6 ) is derived from effective lagrangians , which will be discussed in the following .",
    "the self - energy is then obtained summing the transition amplitude @xmath6 for the different isospins over the nucleon fermi distribution at a given temperature , @xmath7 : @xmath8\\ , \\label{eq : selfd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the total energy and momentum of the meson - nucleon pair in the nuclear matter rest frame , and ( @xmath11,@xmath12 ) and ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) stand for the energy and momentum of the meson and nucleon , respectively , also in this frame .",
    "the self - energy must be determined self - consistently since it is obtained from the in - medium amplitude @xmath6 which contains the meson - baryon loop function , and this last quantity itself is a function of the self - energy .",
    "then , the meson spectral function reads @xmath15     meson spectral function for different momenta , temperatures and densities for the su(4 ) model .",
    "we show the @xmath2 meson free mass for reference ( dotted lines ) .",
    "[ fig1],scaledwidth=45.0%,height=264 ]      the open - charm meson spectral functions are obtained from the bethe - salpeter equation in coupled - channels taking , as bare interaction , a type of broken @xmath17 @xmath18-wave weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) interaction supplemented by an attractive isoscalar - scalar term and using a cutoff regularization scheme .",
    "this cutoff is fixed by generating dynamically the @xmath19 @xmath20 resonance . a new resonance in @xmath21 channel , @xmath22 ,",
    "is generated @xcite .",
    "the in - medium solution at finite temperature incorporates pauli blocking , baryon mean - field bindings and @xmath23 and @xmath2 meson self - energies @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we display the @xmath2 meson spectral function for different momenta , temperatures and densities . at @xmath24",
    "the spectral function shows two peaks .",
    "the @xmath25 excitation is seen at a lower energy whereas the second one at higher energy corresponds to the quasi(d)-particle peak mixed with the @xmath26 state .",
    "those structures dilute with increasing temperature while the quasiparticle peak gets closer to its free value becoming narrower , as the self - energy receives contributions from higher momentum @xmath27 pairs where the interaction is weaker .",
    "finite density results in a broadening of the spectral function because of the increased phase space , as previously observed for the @xmath28 in dense matter @xcite .",
    "heavy - quark symmetry ( hqs ) is a qcd spin - flavor symmetry that appears when the quark masses , such as the charm mass , become larger than the typical confinement scale .",
    "the spin interactions then vanish for infinitely massive quarks and heavy hadrons come in doublets ( if the spin of the light degrees of freedom is not zero ) , which are degenerate in the infinite quark - mass limit . and",
    "this is the case for the @xmath2 meson and its vector partner , the @xmath29 meson .",
    "therefore we calculate the self - energy and , hence , the spectral function of the @xmath2 and @xmath29 mesons in nuclear matter from a simultaneous self - consistent calculation in coupled channels that incorporates hqs .",
    "we extend the wt meson - baryon lagrangian to the @xmath30 spin - flavor symmetry group as we include pseudoscalars and vector mesons together with @xmath31 and @xmath32 baryons @xcite , following the steps for @xmath33 of ref .",
    "the @xmath30 spin - flavor is , however , strongly broken in nature . so that we take into account mass breaking effects by adopting the physical hadron masses in the tree level interactions and in the evaluation of the kinematical thresholds of different channels , as done in the previous @xmath17 models .",
    "moreover , we consider the difference between the weak non - charmed and charmed pseudoscalar and vector meson decay constants .",
    "we also improve on the regularization scheme in nuclear matter going beyond the usual cutoff scheme @xcite .     and @xmath29 spectral functions in nuclear matter at @xmath34 mev / c in the su(8 ) scheme .",

    "[ fig2 ] , the @xmath30 model generates a wider spectrum of resonances with charm @xmath35 and strangeness @xmath36 compared to the @xmath17 models . while the parameters of both @xmath17 and @xmath30 models are fixed by the ( @xmath19 , @xmath37 ) @xmath38 resonance , the fact that we incorporate vectors mesons in the @xmath30 scheme generates naturally @xmath39 resonances , such as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , some of which might be identified experimentally @xcite .",
    "new resonances are also produced for @xmath37 , as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , while others are not obtained in @xmath17 models because of the different symmetry breaking pattern used in both models .",
    "the modifications of the mass and width of these resonances in the nuclear medium are strongly dependent on the coupling to channels with @xmath2 , @xmath29 and @xmath46 content , which are modified in the nuclear medium . moreover",
    ", the resonances close to the @xmath27 or @xmath47 thresholds change their properties more evidently as compared to those far offshell .",
    "the improvement in the regularization / renormalization procedure of the intermediate propagators in the nuclear medium beyond the usual cutoff method has also an important effect on the in - medium changes of the dynamically - generated resonances , in particular , for those lying far offshell from their dominant channel , as the case of the @xmath38 .    on the r.h.s of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we display the @xmath2 and @xmath29 spectral functions , which show then a rich spectrum of resonance - hole states .",
    "the @xmath2 meson quasiparticle peak mixes strongly with @xmath48 and @xmath49 states while the @xmath50 is clearly visible in the low - energy tail .",
    "the @xmath29 spectral function incorporates the @xmath39 resonances , and the quasiparticle peak fully mixes with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . as density increases , these @xmath53 modes tend to smear out and the spectral functions broaden with increasing phase space .",
    "the analysis of the properties of scalar resonances in nuclear matter is a valuable tool in order to understand the nature of those states , whether they are @xmath54 , molecules , mixtures of @xmath54 with meson - meson components , or dynamically generated resonances resulting from the interaction of two pseudoscalars .",
    "we study the charmed resonance @xmath0 @xcite together with a hidden charm scalar meson , @xmath1 , predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , which might have been observed by the belle collaboration @xcite via the reanalysis of ref .",
    "those resonances are generated dynamically solving the coupled - channel bethe - salpeter equation for two pseudoscalars @xcite .",
    "the kernel is derived from a @xmath17 extension of the @xmath55 chiral lagrangian used to generate scalar resonances in the light sector .",
    "the @xmath17 symmetry is , however , strongly broken , mostly due to the explicit consideration of the masses of the vector mesons exchanged between pseudoscalars @xcite .",
    "the transition amplitude around each resonance for the different coupled channels gives us information about the coupling of this state to a particular channel .",
    "the @xmath0 mainly couples to the @xmath56 system , while the hidden charm state @xmath1 couples most strongly to @xmath57 .",
    "then , any change in the @xmath2 meson properties in nuclear matter will have an important effect on these resonances .",
    "those modifications are given by the @xmath2 meson self - energy in the @xmath17 model without the phenomenological isoscalar - scalar term , but supplemented by the @xmath58-wave self - energy through the corresponding @xmath53 excitations @xcite .",

    "[ fig4 ] the resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 are shown by displaying the squared transition amplitude for the corresponding dominant channel at different densities .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances , which have a zero and small width , develop widths of the order of 100 and 200 mev at normal nuclear matter density , respectively .",
    "the origin can be traced back to the opening of new many - body decay channels as the @xmath2 meson gets absorbed in the nuclear medium via @xmath27 and @xmath59 inelastic reactions .",
    "we do not extract any clear conclusion for the mass shift .",
    "we suggest to look at transparency ratios to investigate those in - medium widths .",

    "the possible formation of @xmath2-meson bound states in @xmath62pb was predicted @xcite relying upon a strong mass shift for @xmath2 mesons in the nuclear medium based on a quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite . the experimental observation of those bound states , though , might be problematic since , even if there are bound states , their widths could be very large compared to the separation of the levels .",
    "this is indeed the case for the potential derived from a su(4 ) @xmath16-vector meson exchange model @xcite .",
    "however , the model that incorporates heavy - quark symmetry in the charm sector @xcite generates widths of the @xmath2 meson in nuclear matter sufficiently small with respect to the mass shift to form bound states for @xmath2 mesons in nuclei .    in order to compute de @xmath2-nucleus bound states",
    ", we solve the klein - gordon equation ( kge ) .",
