    "the jacobi equation , also known as the equation of geodesic deviation , describes geodesics in the neighborhood of a reference geodesic . more precisely , the jacobi equation is the linearization of the geodesic equation around the reference geodesic , where the linearization is done with respect to the coordinates and the velocities .",
    "thus , the jacobi equation describes geodesics which are close to the reference geodesic and whose velocities are close to the velocity of the reference geodesic .",
    "the jacobi equation has important applications to general relativity : for timelike geodesics , the jacobi equation describes the relative acceleration of freely falling particles around a freely falling reference particle .",
    "this relative acceleration , which is determined by the curvature tensor along the worldline of the reference particle , can be interpreted as the tidal force produced by the gravitational field . for lightlike geodesics ,",
    "the jacobi equation determines the shape of light bundles around a reference light ray .",
    "again , the expansion and distortion of the bundle is determined by the curvature tensor along the reference light ray .",
    "detailed discussions of the jacobi equation ( or geodesic deviation equation ) can be found in almost any text - book on general relativity , see e.g. synge @xcite , misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite or hawking and ellis @xcite .",
    "if a geodesic is close to a reference geodesic but its velocity is not , the jacobi equation does not give a valid approximation for it .",
    "such a geodesic is properly described by an equation which is linearized only with respect to the coordinates but not with respect to the velocities .",
    "such a generalized jacobi equation was brought forward , for timelike geodesics in a general - relativistic spacetime , by hodgkinson @xcite .",
    "this equation describes tidal forces on particles whose relative velocity is not small .",
    "applications to astrophysics were given by mashhoon @xcite .",
    "the generalized jacobi equation was independently rediscovered by ciufolini @xcite .",
    "more recently , its implications were studied in a series of papers by chicone and mashhoon @xcite .    in geometric terms",
    ", the ordinary jacobi equation approximates the geodesic flow on a tubular neighborhood of the reference geodesic in phase space ( i.e. , in the cotangent bundle over the base manifold ) .",
    "by contrast , the generalized jacobi equation approximates the geodesic flow on a neighborhood in phase space that is unrestricted in the fiber dimension .",
    "all the references quoted above consider the generalized jacobi equation for timelike geodesics , which is physically of particular relevance because of its relation to tidal forces . in this article",
    "we want to discuss the generalized jacobi equation for lightlike geodesics .",
    "then it describes light rays around a reference light ray .",
    "the domain where the generalized jacobi equation is applicable but the jacobi equation is not encompasses all neighboring light rays that are close to the reference light ray but whose velocities are not .    although we are mainly interested in lightlike geodesics , it is worthwile to note that the geodesic equation and , hence , the jacobi equation and the generalized jacobi equation can be formulated on an affine manifold , without a metric .",
    "all that is needed is a connection .",
    "we begin by deriving the affine generalized jacobi equation in section [ sec : affine ] . in section [ sec : lightlike ] we specify to lightlike geodesics of a lorentzian metric . in this case , the generalized jacobi equation can be used to describe light bundles with arbitrarily large opening angle around a reference light ray .",
    "of course , if the opening angle is large , the light rays will leave the neighborhood of the reference light ray soon , unless they are being refocused towards the reference light ray .",
    "so the generalized jacobi equation can be used , in general , as a valid approximation only close to the vertex of the bundle .",
    "the general results of this section are illustrated by considering a bundle around a circular light ray at @xmath0 in schwarzschild spacetime . in section",
    "[ sec : fermi ] we consider lightlike fermi normal coordinates which allow to write the generalized jacobi equation in terms of the curvature tensor along the reference light ray . as an example",
    ", we consider a bundle of light rays in a plane - wave spacetime .    throughout",
    "we work with the generalized jacobi equation in the sense of hodgkinson , mashhoon etc .",
    "this equation is linearized with respect to the coordinates but retains full dependence of the velocities . as an alternative",
    ", one may approximate with respect to the coordinates and the velocities up to common order @xmath1 .",
    "this approach , which dates back to baaski @xcite , can be used to set up an iterative scheme .",
    "one begins by solving the ordinary jacobi equation , then calculates the corrections due to second - order terms and so on .",
    "this method was applied to particle motion in schwarzschild and kerr spacetimes by kerner et al .",

    "an affine manifold is a manifold with an affine connection @xmath2 . in local coordinates ,",
    "the connection is determined by its connection coefficients @xmath3 , @xmath4 here and in the following , the dimension of the manifold is @xmath5 , and we use the summation convention for greek indices running from 1 to @xmath5 .",
    "whenever we have an affine manifold , we can consider the geodesic equation @xmath6 the solution curves @xmath7 of ( [ eq : geo ] ) are the geodesics ( autoparallels ) of the affine connection . as",
    "a geodesic remains a geodesic under affine reparametrization , @xmath8 , it is usual to refer to @xmath9 as to an `` affine parameter '' .",
    "note that only the symmetric part of @xmath3 enters into the geodesic equation .",
    "the antisymmetric part @xmath10 which is called the `` torsion '' , drops out from the geodesic equation . as in the following we are interested only in the geodesic equation , and in equations derived thereof",
    ", we may replace any connection by its symmetrized version .",
    "therefore we will assume in the following that the connection is symmetric , @xmath11 .",
    "( for the jacobi equation and some of its generalizations in terms of a non - symmetric connection see , e.g. , swaminarayan and safko @xcite . )",
    "now fix a geodesic @xmath12 , @xmath13 we will call it the `` reference geodesic '' , and we will assume that it is known , i.e. , that we have the @xmath14 explicitly as functions of the curve parameter @xmath9 . then the geodesic equation for a neighboring curve @xmath15 results from inserting @xmath16 into ( [ eq : geo ] ) and subtracting ( [ eq : geox ] ) , @xmath17 \\nonumber   - \\ ;   \\gamma   ^{\\mu } _ { \\nu \\sigma } ( x ) \\ ,   \\frac{d x ^{\\nu}}{ds }   \\ , \\frac{d x ^{\\sigma}}{ds }   \\ , = \\ , 0 \\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 known , ( [ eq : geoxi ] ) is a system of second order ordinary differential equations for the @xmath5 functions @xmath18 .",

    "the generalized jacobi equation ( [ eq : genjac ] ) is a second order non - linear ordinary differential equation for @xmath18 .",
    "it is non - autonomous because the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 are functions of the curve parameter @xmath9 .",
    "it gives a valid approximation for all those geodesics for which the @xmath18 are small , whereas the @xmath32 need not be small .",
    "of course , if the @xmath32 are not small , the @xmath18 will in general remain small only for a small interval of the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "such geodesics will leave the neighborhood of the reference geodesic soon and the generalized jacobi equation will , in general , give a valid approximation for them only on a small interval of the parameter @xmath9 .    the generalized jacobi equation may be modified in two ways .    * one may prefer to choose a different , non - affine , parametrization for the ( approximate ) geodesics .",
    "* one may wish to choose special coordinates such that the generalized jacobi equation takes a simpler form and that it can be easier compared for two different geodesics .",
    "both is possible in an affine manifold , without refering to a metric .    as to the first item ,",
    "it is often convenient to use on a geodesic a ( non - affine ) parameter @xmath33 which coincides with one of the coordinates , say @xmath34 .",
    "this is possible for all curves which are transverse to the hypersurfaces @xmath35 .",
    "then the dependence of the @xmath36 coordinate on the parameter is known , @xmath37 , and the geodesic equation reduces to a system of differential equations for the remaining coordinate functions @xmath38 .",
    "the condition that two curves @xmath39 and @xmath40 , both parametrized by @xmath34 , are geometrically close is equivalent to the condition that the @xmath41 are small for @xmath42 .",
    "by contrast , if an affine parameter @xmath9 is used it may be that not all of the @xmath43 are small even if the two geodesics are geometrically close .",
    "this happens if the affine parameter on one of the two geodesics lags behind or runs ahead of the other .",
    "therefore we will now rewrite the generalized jacobi equation with respect to the new curve parameter @xmath44 .",
    "we first observe that the @xmath45 component of the geodesic equation ( [ eq : geo ] ) can be written in the form @xmath46 and the remaining @xmath47 components as @xmath48 here and in the following , latin indices @xmath49 take values 1 to @xmath47 . calculating the first term of ( [ eq : geoi ] ) with the product rule and inserting ( [ eq : geon ] ) results in @xmath50 together with the equation @xmath51 , ( [ eq : geored ] ) determines the geodesics ( or , more precisely , those geodesics that are transverse to the surfaces @xmath35 ) with the non - affine parametrization by @xmath52 .",

    "to that end we will use fermi coordinates . text - books on general relativity",
    "treat fermi coordinates near a timelike reference geodesic ( or , more generally , near a timelike reference curve ) in a lorentzian manifold , see e.g. synge @xcite . however , it is fairly obvious that , by an analogous procedure , one can introduce fermi coordinates near an arbitrary reference geodesic in an affine manifold , without a metric .",
    "the construction is as follows .",
    "let an affinely parametrized geodesic @xmath25 be given .",
    "choose an @xmath5-bein ( i.e. , @xmath5 linearly independent vectors ) at one point of the geodesic , such that the @xmath5th vector coincides with the tangent vector of the geodesic , and transport this @xmath5-bein parallelly along @xmath25 .",
    "denote the @xmath5 resulting vector fields along the geodesic by @xmath61 . as @xmath25 is an affinely parametrized geodesic ,",
    "@xmath62 coincides with the tangent vector @xmath63 for all @xmath9 .",
    "let exp denote the exponential map of the given connection which , as indicated above , is assumed to be torsion - free .",
    "then every point in a sufficiently small tubular neighborhood of the given geodesic can be written uniquely as @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath5 numbers @xmath65 are the fermi coordinates of this point . by definition of the exponential map",
    ", this means that the fermi coordinates are determined by the following property : the point with fermi coordinates @xmath65 can be reached by following the geodesic with initial point @xmath39 and initial tangent vector @xmath66 up to the affine parameter 1 . by construction ,",
    "the fermi coordinate @xmath33 coincides along the geodesic @xmath25 with the affine parameter @xmath9 .",
    "along neighboring geodesics , however , the fermi coordinate @xmath33 will give a non - affine parametrization in general .    note that fermi coordinates are well - defined only on a ( possibly small ) tubular neighborhood of a chosen geodesic @xmath25 .",
    "farther away from @xmath25 they need not exist , because there may be points that can not be reached by a geodesic starting on @xmath25 , and they need not be unique , because geodesics issuing from a point on @xmath25 may intersect .",
    "the crucial property of fermi coordinates is that , in such coordinates , the connection coefficients @xmath3 vanish on @xmath25 . to prove this",
    ", we first observe that @xmath67 along @xmath25 because the @xmath68 are parallelly transported , hence @xmath69 .",
    "as the connection is symmetric , this implies that @xmath70 .",
    "what remains to be proven is that @xmath71 .",
    "we use the fact that @xmath72 as for any @xmath47-tuple @xmath73 the integral curves of @xmath74 that start on @xmath25 are geodesics , the left - hand side and the first two terms on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : ij ] ) vanish on @xmath25 . thus , ( [ eq : ij ] ) tells us that @xmath75 . as our connection is symmetric , this implies that , indeed , @xmath76 .",
    "if written in fermi coordinates , the generalized jacobi equation ( [ eq : genjacred ] ) simplifies considerably because of @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , the use of fermi coordinates reduces the generalized jacobi equation to a standard form which facilitates comparison of this equation for two different geodesics . in section",
    "[ sec : fermi ] below we will make this explicit for lightlike geodesics in a lorentzian manifold , where the fermi coordinates can be further specified .",
    "we now specify the results of the preceding section to the case that @xmath2 is the levi - civita connection of a pseudo - riemannian metric @xmath78 , @xmath79 where , as usual , @xmath80 we assume that the metric has lorentzian signature @xmath81 , and we want to discuss the generalized jacobi equation for the case of lightlike geodesics , @xmath82 if the dimension @xmath5 of the manifold is equal to 4 , lightlike geodesics can be interpreted as light rays in a general - relarivistic spacetime . the mathematical results , however , hold for any @xmath5 .",
    "let us briefly recall the well - known fact that , if the connection coefficients @xmath3 are given in terms of a metric via ( [ eq : lc ] ) , the geodesic equation ( [ eq : geo ] ) can be derived from a hamiltonian . as a matter of fact , hamilton s equations for the hamiltonian @xmath83 take the form @xmath84 @xmath85 the derivative with respect to @xmath9 of ( [ eq : hamp ] ) , together with ( [ eq : hamx ] ) and ( [ eq : lc ] ) , indeed reproduces the geodesic equation ( [ eq : geo ] ) . by ( [ eq : hamx ] ) , the side - condition ( [ eq : lightlike ] ) takes the form @xmath86 a reparametrization of the solution curves can be achieved for lightlike geodesics in a particularly convenient way : we just have to multiply the hamiltonian with an appropriate function of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "if we want to change from the affine parameter @xmath9 to the parameter @xmath52 , we can proceed in the following way .",
    "we first recall that such a reparametrization is possible for all geodesics that are transverse to the hypersurfaces @xmath89 .",

    "this condition determines an open subset of the cotangent bundle ( phase space ) . on this subset",
    "we can switch from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) to the modified hamiltonian @xmath91 hamilton s equation with the hamiltonian @xmath92 read @xmath93 @xmath94 and the side - condition ( [ eq : cone ] ) is equivalent to @xmath95 with ( [ eq : tcone ] ) , the @xmath96 component of ( [ eq : thamx ] ) reduces to @xmath97 so the new curve parameter @xmath33 coincides , indeed , with the coordinate @xmath36 ( up to an additive constant that can be chosen at will ) .",

    "it is usual to require that the @xmath5-bein be orthonormal . then @xmath152 span the spacelike orthocomplement of @xmath151 at each value of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , in the fermi coordinates @xmath153 the hypersurfaces @xmath154 intersect the timelike reference geodesic @xmath25 orthogonally and are , therefore , spacelike near x(s ) .",
    "( farther away from @xmath25 they need not be spacelike . )",
    "these are the fermi normal coordinates treated in standard text - books on general relativity . in these",
    "coordinates the metric attains a standard form if written up to second order in the transverse coordinates .",
    "this standard form was derived by manasse and misner @xcite and can be found , e.g. , in misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite , p.332 .",
    "whereas this standard text - book treatment of fermi normal coordinates assumes a timelike geodesic , here we are interrested in fermi coordinates near a lightlike reference geodesic @xmath25",
    ". then the @xmath5-bein can not be chosen orthonormal because of the requirement that @xmath155 .",
    "the best choice is to have @xmath156 lightlike with @xmath157 and the remaining vectors @xmath158 orthonormal and perpendicular to both @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "( condition ( [ eq : enorm ] ) assures that @xmath159 is future - pointing if @xmath160 is future - pointing . ) with this choice , the resulting fermi coordinates @xmath161 yield hypersurfaces @xmath162 that are lightlike where they meet the reference geodesic @xmath25 .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath163 is lightlike along the reference geodesic @xmath25 which is completely contained in this hypersurface .",
    "these lightlike fermi normal coordinates were discussed in some detail in a recent article by blau , frank and weiss @xcite . in that article , the authors derive the general expression for the metric in lightlike fermi normal coordinates , up to second order in the coordinates away from the reference geodesic .",
    "this result is the lightlike analogue of the above - mentioned manasse - misner representation of the metric near a timelike geodesic .",
    "if adapted to our sign and index conventions , it reads @xmath164 here the fermi coordinates are denoted @xmath165 , as outlined above . as before , greek indices run from 1 to @xmath5 and lower case latin indices @xmath166 run from 1 to @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , upper case latin indices @xmath167 run from 1 to @xmath168 . as usual",
    ", @xmath169 denotes the kronecker delta .",
    "@xmath170 is the purely covariant version of the curvature tensor ( [ eq : curv ] ) , evaluated at @xmath171 , i.e. , along the reference geodesic .",
    "the ellipses in ( [ eq : fermig ] ) indicate terms of third and higher order with respect to the @xmath172 .    with the contravariant metric components @xmath118 calculated , up to second order , from ( [ eq : fermig ] ) , we can write the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamred ] ) up to second order .",
    "this is enough to write the pertaining hamilton equations up to first order , which together with the constraint ( [ eq : tcone ] ) will give us the generalized jacobi equation in lightlike fermi normal coordinates near an arbitrary lightlike reference geodesic .",
    "we will illustrate this with an example .",
    "* example 2 * : consider a plane - wave spacetime in brinkmann coordinates @xmath173 , @xmath174 where @xmath175 has a non - negative trace , @xmath176 but is arbitrary otherwise . for @xmath107 , any such metric can be interpreted as a combined gravitational and electromagnetic plane wave .",
    "if equality holds in ( [ eq : trace ] ) , the spacetime is ricci - flat and , thus , a pure gravitational wave . for any choice of @xmath177 ,",
    "the vector field @xmath178 is lightlike and absolutely parallel . for a discussion of the geometry of plane - wave spacetimes",
    "the reader is refered to penrose @xcite .",
    "plane - wave spacetimes have the following interesting property , first discovered by penrose @xcite . near _ any _ lightlike geodesic in _",
    "any _ spacetime , the metric takes the form of a plane wave in a well - defined limit , called the penrose limit .",
    "thereby the original geodesic is represented as the curve @xmath179 in the limiting plane - wave spacetime ( [ eq : plane ] ) .",
    "the penrose limit can be conveniently written in terms of lightlike fermi normal coordinate , as recently demonstrated by blau , frank and weiss @xcite .",
    "in particular , their analysis showed that brinkmann coordinates for plane waves are lightlike fermi normal coordinates ; in this case all the higher - order terms , which are indicated in ( [ eq : fermig ] ) by ellipses , vanish exactly .",
    "the curvature tensor is given along the geodesic @xmath179 by @xmath180 and @xmath181 for all other index combinations , compare ( [ eq : fermig ] ) with ( [ eq : plane ] ) .",
    "we want to write the generalized jacobi equation near the lightlike geodesic @xmath182 .",
    "we will use @xmath34 for the curve parameter . after calculating the contravariant metric components from ( [ eq : plane ] ) , we can write the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamred ] ) : @xmath183 note that this hamiltonian is of second order with respect to the coordinates @xmath184 and independent of the coordinate @xmath185 .",
    "hamilton s equations with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamplane ] ) take the form @xmath186",

    "three dimensions @xmath188 are shown , with @xmath33 future - pointing lightlike ( from lower right to upper left ) , @xmath185 future - pointing lightlike ( from lower left to upper right ) , and @xmath189 orthogonal to both .",
    "the picture is valid for the case that @xmath189 is an eigendirection of @xmath177 with positive eigenvalue . in this case in the three - dimensional picture all the light rays issuing from an event into the past are refocused into another event , with the exception of one single light ray that stays on an integral curve of the absolutely parallel lightlike vector field @xmath178 .",
    "a colour version of this picture can be found online in @xcite .",
    "for a similar picture , hand - drawn by roger penrose , see @xcite . , width=396 ]    applying @xmath100 to ( [ eq : xplane ] ) , and using ( [ eq : pplane ] ) , gives us the lightlike geodesic equation in second - order form : @xmath190 @xmath191 if we write @xmath192 and linearize with respect to @xmath193 and @xmath194 , we get the generalized jacobi equation @xmath195 for the transverse coordinates @xmath196 , these equations are independent of the velocities ; hence , the generalized jacobi equation coincides with the ordinary geodesic equation",
    ". moreover , the ( generalized ) jacobi equation even coincides with the exact geodesic equation ( [ eq : xa ] ) .",
    "if we solve these equations with initial conditions @xmath197 it gives us the cross - section of an initially circular light bundle around the geodesic @xmath198 with vertex at @xmath108 .",
    "such a bundle will have an elliptic cross - section , for arbitrarily large opening angle .",
    "the rate of expansion is positive in eigen - directions of @xmath199 with negative eigenvalues and negative in eigen - directions of @xmath199 with positive eigenvalues .",
    "condition ( [ eq : trace ] ) makes sure that at least one eigenvalue is positive ( unless all are zero in which case ( [ eq : plane ] ) is just the minkowski metric ) . in directions with positive eigenvalue",
    "the light bundle will be refocussed until a conjugate point is reached .",
    "this focusing property is illustrated by figure [ fig : wave ] which displays the past - light cone of an event in a plane - wave spacetime , with three dimensions @xmath188 shown .",
    "the fact that , for the lightlike geodesic @xmath179 in a plane - wave spacetime , the generalized jacobi equation coincides with the ordinary jacobi equation has the following interesting consequence : in the penrose limit the difference between the generalized jacobi equation and the jacobi equation vanishes .",
    "in this article we have discussed a generalized jacobi equation for lightlike geodesics , following as closely as possible the approach that was brought forward by hodgkinson , mashhoon and others for timelike geodesics . as an alternative",
    ", one could also apply the approach of baaski @xcite , which was mentioned in the introduction , to lightlike geodesics . in that case",
    "one would consider lightlike geodesics of the form @xmath200 , where @xmath25 is a lightlike reference geodesic , and solve the geodesic equation for @xmath201 iteratively up to some order @xmath1 with respect to @xmath202 .",
    "for any finite order @xmath1 , the resulting equation would not be valid for light bundles of arbitrarily large opening angle , in contrast to the generalized jacobi equation treated here .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath202 sufficiently small it would be valid for arbitrarily large parameter intervals .",
    "an interesting application of this baaski - type approach to lightlike geodesics , which apparently has not been considered in the literature so far , could be to study the caustics of light bundles up to some order @xmath1 with respect to @xmath202 ."
