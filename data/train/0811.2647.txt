    "entanglement between qubits may disappear in a finite time when the qubits interact with a reservoir .",
    "this is commonly known as `` entanglement sudden death '' ( esd ) .",
    "after its discovery @xcite , the phenomenon has attracted great attention ( for instance , @xcite ) and has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "esd shows up in a variety of systems that can be roughly divided in two sets : those in which the qubits interact individually with different reservoirs and those in which they interact with a common environment . in particular , in @xcite",
    "a system of a pair of two - level atoms interacting with a common electromagnetic vacuum is considered .",
    "the dynamics of the system is given in all the cases by the lehmberg - agarwal master equation @xcite which is derived with the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and the born - markov approximation .",
    "recently , non - markovian @xcite and non - rwa @xcite effects have been considered in systems of qubits coupled individually to different reservoirs .",
    "there are good reasons for going beyond the markovian and rwa scenario in the case of a pair of two - level atoms in the electromagnetic vacuum . for short enough times",
    "non - rwa contributions are relevant @xcite and a proper analysis of causality issues can only be performed if they are taken into account @xcite .",
    "besides , as we shall show in this paper the death of the entanglement between the atoms is related with the birth of entanglement between the atoms and the field , and therefore the field is actually a non- markovian reservoir .",
    "this was also the case in @xcite with different reservoirs .    in @xcite",
    "we have applied the formalism of perturbative quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) to the system of a pair of neutral two - level atoms interacting locally with the electromagnetic field , and for initially separable states analyzed the generation of entanglement .",
    "this is a non - markovian , non - rwa approach .",
    "the use of the lehmberg - agarwal master equation can be seen as a coarse - grained in time approximation to the perturbative treatment @xcite .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to apply also the qed formalism to analyze the esd in these systems for initially entangled atomic states , comparing the results with the previously obtained @xcite with master equations .",
    "we will focus mainly on the range @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the interatomic distance and @xmath2 the interaction time , in order to investigate the role of locality .",
    "we will also consider for the first time in these systems the rest of pairwise concurrences , namely the entanglement of each atom with the field , and multipartite entanglement , following the spirit of @xcite .",
    "while the mentioned papers deal with a four qubit model , our model here consists in two qubits ( the atoms ) and a qutrit ( the electromagnetic field , which may have 0 , 1 or 2 photons ) .",
    "we shall show that the phenomenon of revival of entanglement after the esd @xcite can occur for @xmath3 , and therefore is not related with photon exchange as is usually believed .",
    "we will see that atom - atom disentaglement is connected with the growth of atom - field entanglement and viceversa .",
    "similar relationship will be obtained among the `` atom-(atom+field ) '' and `` field-(atom+atom ) '' entanglements .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we will describe the hamiltonian and the time evolution from the initial state of the system . in section iii",
    "we will obtain the reduced state of the atoms and analyze the behavior of its entanglement . in section",
    "iv the same will be performed with the reduced state of each atom and the field , comparing the entanglement cycle with the one obtained in the previous section .",
    "tripartite entanglement will be considered in section v in terms of the entanglement of all the different bi - partitions of the system , and we conclude in section vi with a summary of our results .",
    "to address the atom - field interactions , we assume that the relevant wavelengths and the interatomic separation are much larger than the atomic dimensions .",
    "the dipole approximation , appropriate to these conditions , permits the splitting of the system hamiltonian into two parts @xmath4 that are separately gauge invariant .",
    "the first part is the hamiltonian in the absence of interactions other than the potentials that keep @xmath5 and @xmath6 stable , @xmath7 .",
    "the second contains all the interaction of the atoms with the field , which in the dipole approximation we will use is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electric displacement field , and @xmath10 is the electric dipole moment of atom @xmath11 , that we will take of equal magnitude for both atoms @xmath12 as required by angular momentum conservation in the photon exchange . @xmath13 and @xmath14 will denote the excited and ground states of the atoms , respectively .",
    "in what follows we choose a system given initially by an atomic entangled state , with the field in the vacuum state @xmath15 : @xmath16 the system then evolves under the effect of the interaction during a lapse of time @xmath2 into a state : @xmath17 @xmath18 being the time ordering operator .",
    "up to second order in perturbation theory , ( [ c ] ) can be given in the interaction picture as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 being @xmath23 , @xmath18 the time ordering operator and @xmath24 is a shorthand for the state of @xmath11 photons with definite momenta and polarizations , i.e. @xmath25 , etc . here ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 describe intra - atomic radiative corrections , @xmath28 and @xmath29 single photon emission by atom @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 by both atoms , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 correspond to two photon emission by a single atom .",
    "only @xmath34 and @xmath35 correspond to interaction between both atoms .",
    "the sign of the superscripts is associated to the energy difference between the initial and final atomic states of each emission or absorption . in quantum optics , virtual terms like @xmath27 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath31 , which do not conserve energy and appear only at very short times ,",
    "are usually neglected by the introduction of a rwa . in the dipole approximation the actions @xmath38 in ( [ e ] ) reduce to @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the transition frequency , and we are neglecting atomic recoil .",
    "this depends on the atomic properties @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and on the interaction time @xmath2 . in our calculations",
    "we will take @xmath43 2p transition in the hydrogen atom , consider @xmath44 , and focus mainly on the cases @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 is actually a triply degenerate state @xmath46 with @xmath47 and we will average over two different independent possibilities for dipole orientations : @xmath48 for transitions with @xmath49 @xcite and @xmath50 @xcite for transitions with @xmath51 .",
    "after tracing over all the states of the field , the density matrix of the atomic state @xmath52 takes the form ( in the basis @xmath53 ) : @xmath54 where @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    the computation of @xmath26 , @xmath34 , etc .",
    "can be performed following the lines given in the appendix a of @xcite , where they were computed for the initial state @xmath60 and only for @xmath49 . in terms of @xmath61 and @xmath62 ,",
    "being @xmath1 the interatomic distance , we find : @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where : @xmath66\\label{l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath67 , having the additional term @xmath68 otherwise .",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 have been computed in @xcite .",
    "besides : @xmath75 where the primes are introduced to discriminate between the two single photons .",
    "we will use the concurrence @xmath76 @xcite to compute the entanglement , which for a state like ( [ i ] ) is given by , if @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 otherwise .    if we take @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we find that esd appears at a range of values of @xmath82 that decreases with increasing @xmath1 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "although this would suggest that esd disappear for @xmath1 large enough , we find that there are high values of @xmath82 for which esd exists for arbitrary large @xmath1 . in fig . 1",
    ", we represent @xmath83 in front of @xmath84 for different values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "esd occurs at @xmath87 of the order of @xmath88 .",
    "thus , as @xmath85 ( that is @xmath1 ) grows , esd is shifted to higher values of @xmath84 .",
    "it is also interesting to analyze the phenomenon of entanglement revival , discovered in these systems in @xcite .",
    "we find that the dark periods @xcite between death and revival has larger time durations for increasing @xmath85 .",
    "besides , although in @xcite the revival is described as a consequence of the photon exchange , for @xmath1 sufficiently large both the esd and the revival can occur for @xmath67 , where photon exchange is not allowed .",
    "we think that the explanation for entanglement revival is closer to the spirit of @xcite where entanglement revival between noninteracting atoms is interpreted as coming from entanglement transfer between different parts of the system .",
    "we shall discuss this point in the following sections",
    ".     in front of @xmath89 for @xmath86 and @xmath90 ( solid line ) , @xmath91 ( dashed line ) and @xmath92 ( dotted line ) . in the latter case sudden death and revival of entanglement occur for @xmath67.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .",
    "2 we sketch the dependence with @xmath82 . although sudden death and revivals appear in a very restricted range of the parameter , they are only a particular case of the generic behavior of entanglement observed in a wider range , which can be described as disentanglement up to a minimum value and growth of quantum correlations since then .",

    "this behavior becomes entanglement sudden death and revival when the minimum value is 0 for higher values of @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 tends to 0 as @xmath96 and @xmath97.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "tracing ( [ d ] ) over states of atom a ( b ) the reduced atom - field density matrix @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) is obtained . taking the basis @xmath100",
    ", we have : @xmath101 with @xmath102 there are no operational generalizations of concurrence for mixed states in @xmath103 dimensions like the ones in eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) . we will use the negativity @xcite @xmath104 , which is the absolute value of the sum of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transposes of a state @xmath105 . for the @xmath106 and @xmath103 cases",
