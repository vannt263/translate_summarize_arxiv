    "the coupled quantum system consisting of a two - level system interacting with a harmonic oscillator provides a model that has been focus of a large number of studies over recent decades .",
    "a reduced ( rabi hamiltonian ) version of the problem was published by bloch and siegert in studies of the interaction of a dynamical magnetic field perpendicular to a static magnetic field with a spin system @xcite , and was later applied to the problem of atoms interacting with an electromagnetic mode @xcite .",
    "the more complete model ( spin - boson hamiltonian ) was introduced much later by cohen - tannoudji and collaborators @xcite .    at the most basic level , the interaction of the two - level system with the oscillator produces a shift in the two - level energy ( the bloch - siegert shift ) .",
    "energy exchange between the two - level and oscillator is allowed when the shifted two - level system energy becomes resonant with an odd number of oscillator quanta , which results in level anticrossings at these resonances ( bloch - siegert resonances ) .",
    "if the characteristic energy of the oscillator @xmath0 is much less than the transition energy @xmath1 , then many oscillator quanta are required to match the shifted ( dressed ) transition energy .",
    "in such a limit , the model is considered to be in the multiphoton regime ; which is a topic of current interest @xcite .",
    "the models under consideration in this work are studied in the multiphoton regime .",
    "if the oscillator is highly excited , then the problem simplifies .",
    "the two - level system interacts with the oscillator to produce a shift as before ; however , the oscillator is only weakly impacted by the two - level system since the two - level energy in this case amounts to a small fraction of the total oscillator energy . in this limit",
    "the bloch - siegert shift is accurately approximated using an adiabatic model @xcite , and we have obtained new estimates for the level splitting at the anticrossings @xcite using degenerate perturbation theory on a rotated version of the model . in the rotated problem , multiphoton transitions are mediated through a complicated `` perturbation '' operator , but in the end the level - splitting is obtained approximately from a simple two - state model with only first - order coupling .",
    "the complicated interactions of the original spin - boson problem , which are responsible for energy exchange of a large number of quanta , are reasonably well accounted for through the lowest - order coupling in the rotated version of the problem .",
    "this approach , and the resulting conceptual simplification of the problem , is reasonably general and very powerful .",
    "we extended the analysis to the case of a spin - one system coupled to an oscillator @xcite , and obtained results for the bloch - siegert shift in agreement with previous work , as well as new results for the level splitting at the bloch - siegert resonances .",
    "the accuracy was comparable to that obtained for the spin - boson model , and it seems clear that the approach can be applied systematically to higher - spin generalizations of the spin - boson model as well .",
    "we also studied a different generalization of the spin - boson model in which a three - level system is coupled to an oscillator @xcite .",
    "technical issues associated with the three - level system made the implementation of the rotation much more challenging ; however , in the end we obtained good results for the level shifts , and for the level splitting at the anticrossings , as long as the anticrossing occured away from other strong resonances which interfere .    in this work",
    "we turn our attention to a different generalization of the spin - boson model in which two different two - level systems are coupled to an oscillator .",
    "this and related models have been studied in connection with studies of the interaction between two atoms and a cavity @xcite , and quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "our approach is most useful in the multiphoton regime with a highly excited oscillator . in this case",
    ", both two - level systems experience bloch - siegert shifts due to their interaction with the oscillator , and anticrossings occur associated with energy exchange between each two - level system and the oscillator .",
    "the bloch - siegert shift for each two - level system in this case is very close to what would be expected if the other two - level system were absent , and the level splittings at the energy exchange anticrossings are not very different from the single two - level version of the problem .",
    "what is new in this problem are anticrossings associated with excitation transfer , in which the excitation from one two - level system is transferred to the other . in the rotated version of this model , we find a spin - spin interaction term which mediates these new excitation transfer transitions .",
    "our attention in this work is then focused on excitation transfer , and we find that a simple two - state model and degenerate perturbation theory leads to reasonably accurate estimates of the level splittings away from other resonances .",
    "the excitation transfer effect in this model is very weak . to study it in a regime",
    "in which energy exchange resonances do not interfere , we need to work with low oscillator energy ( which maximizes the number of oscillator quanta needed for resonance ) and modest oscillator excitation ( since the level splitting is inversely proportional to the number of oscillator quanta ) .",
    "the reason why excitation transfer is so weak in this model is studied using a finite - basis approximation ; in which we see that destructive interference occurs between the contributions from pathways involving intermediate states .",
    "we briefly examine the possibility of reducing or eliminating the destructive interference , in order to make the excitation transfer effect stronger .",
    "if the model is modified so that the coupling between the different two - level systems is through conjugate oscillator operators , then some of the destructive interference is removed .",
    "if the model is augmented with loss terms that remove the contribution of the lower - energy intermediate states , then the destructive interference is completely eliminated ; the excitation transfer effect then becomes much stronger .",
    "we consider the model described by the hamiltonian    @xmath2    there are a pair of two - level systems , with unperturbed transition energies @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; and an oscillator , with characteristic energy @xmath0 .",
    "the first two - level system interacts linearly with the oscillator , with a coupling strength of @xmath5 ; similarly , the second two - level system also interacts linearly with the oscillator , with a coupling strength of @xmath6 .",
    "the spin operators are defined in terms of the pauli matrices according to    @xmath7    where the superscript denotes which two - level system is referenced . in the multiphoton regime ,",
    "the characteristic energy of the oscillator is much less than the unperturbed transition energies    @xmath8",
    "as in our previous work on the spin - boson problem @xcite , we find it useful to consider a unitary equivalent hamiltonian    @xmath9    where    @xmath10    since @xmath11 commutes with @xmath12 , the computation is very similar to the single two - level problem .",
    "this unitary transform is a straightforward generalization of one used previously for the spin - boson problem @xcite      we can write the rotated hamiltonian as    @xmath13    where the `` unperturbed '' part of the rotated hamiltonian @xmath14 is given by    @xmath15    where    @xmath16    this is similar to the unperturbed part that we obtained previously in the case of the spin - boson model , where now two dressed two - level terms appear instead of one .    in the spin - boson model , and also in other problems that we have studied , the `` unperturbed '' part @xmath17 of the rotated hamiltonian @xmath14 results in a good approximation for the oscillator and dressed transition energy of the two - level systems .",
    "it can be used to develop approximations for resonance conditions as we discuss in the next section .",
    "because of this , we have come to think of @xmath17 as describing an unperturbed version of the dressed problem in which no interactions occur at level crossings",
    ". viewed in this way , the other terms in the rotated hamiltonian can be thought of as perturbations .",
    "there are now two primary perturbations @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( only a single one appears in the spin - boson problem since there is only one two - level system in that model ) , each of which can be described by the general formula    @xmath20    where    @xmath21    in the multiphoton regime , these terms give rise to level splittings at resonances in which one unit of excitation of a two - level system is exchanged for an odd number of oscillator quanta , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "there are two small terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 , both described through the general formula    @xmath24    since the square of the spin operator @xmath25 is proportional to the identity matrix    @xmath26    these terms become simple potentials    @xmath27    in the large @xmath28 limit which is of interest in this paper , these potentials are very small , and do not contribute in a significant way to either the occurrence of resonances or the level splitting at resonance .",
    "we neglect them in what follows .",
    "finally , we find a spin - spin operator @xmath29 given by    0.1 in    @xmath30    0.1 in    this operator has no analog in the spin - boson model . in the multiphoton regime",
    "this term contributes to the level splitting associated with resonances involving excitation transfer ( where one unit of excitation in one two - level system is exchanged for one unit of excitation in the other two - level system , accompanied by the exchange of an even number of oscillator quanta ) .",
    "as this effect is new in this model , it will be the focus of our attention in this work .",
