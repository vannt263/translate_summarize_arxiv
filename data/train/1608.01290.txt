    "a well - known adage in mathematical physics is that `` quantization is not a functor , '' but with suitable restrictions , there are situations where quantization is functorial . our goal here is to articulate the simplest piece of the batalin - vilkovisky formalism as a functor , using modern machinery of higher categories and derived geometry .",
    "the most fundamental case of quantization assigns to the vector space @xmath1 the _ weyl algebra _ , which is the associative algebra on @xmath2 generators @xmath3 with relations @xmath4 = 0 = [ q_{i},q_{j}]$ ] and @xmath5=\\delta_{ij}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath1 should be thought of as the cotangent bundle of @xmath6 , equipped with its standard symplectic structure , which is the arena for classical mechanics on @xmath6 .",
    "this assignment can formulated as a functor , known as _ weyl quantization _ , from symplectic vector spaces ( or more generally , vector spaces with a skew - symmetric pairing ) to assocative algebras . for us",
    "this is the model case of functorial quantization .",
    "this construction naturally breaks up into three steps :    1 .   to a vector space @xmath7 with skew - symmetric pairing @xmath8",
    "we associate its _ heisenberg lie algebra _",
    "@xmath9 , which is the direct sum @xmath10 equipped with the lie bracket where @xmath11 = \\omega(x , y)\\hbar\\ ] ] for @xmath12 in @xmath7 , and all other brackets are zero",
    "to the lie algebra @xmath9 , we assign its universal enveloping algebra @xmath13 .",
    "if we now set @xmath14 to 1 , we get the _ weyl algebra _ : @xmath15 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we set @xmath16 we get @xmath17 , equipped with the poisson bracket @xmath18/\\hbar = \\omega(x , y),\\ ] ] for @xmath19 , which is an algebraic version of the poisson algebra of classical observables . the universal enveloping algebra @xmath20 can thus be viewed as a deformation quantization of the poisson algebra @xmath17 .",
    "this procedure is at the core of all approaches to `` free theories , '' and hence the base case for the more challenging and more interesting interacting theories .",
    "our main object of study in this paper is a _ derived _ and _ shifted _ version of this construction  _ derived _ in the sense that we replace vector spaces by cochain complexes ( or more generally modules over a commutative differential graded algebra ) and _ shifted _ in the sense that we consider skew - symmetric pairings of degree 1 .",
    "we will construct a functorial quantization of these objects to _ @xmath21-algebras _ ( which are just pointed cochain complexes ) , using shifted versions of the heisenberg lie algebra construction and of the universal enveloping algebra .",
    "( in general , we expect that there is a functorial quantization of cochain complexes with @xmath22-shifted skew - symmetric pairings to @xmath0-algebras , and we discuss below how we believe this arises naturally from the case @xmath23 that we consider . )    our construction produces the simplest possible examples of _ batalin - vilkovisky quantization_. this homological approach to quantization of field theories was introduced by batalin and vilkovisky @xcite as a generalization of the brst formalism , in an effort to deal with complicated field theories such as supergravity .",
    "their formalism for field theory , both classical and quantum , has broad application and conceptual depth .",
    "( for recent work on these issues , see @xcite . ) for brevity , we will talk about the _ bv formalism _ and _ bv quantization_. ( we should point out that we mean here the lagrangian formulation , whose quantum aspect is focused on a homological approach to the path integral . )    in this introduction , we begin by describing our main results in  [ subsec : mainresults ] .",
    "next we describe some consequences in the setting of derived geometry in  [ subsec : dag ] and then discuss an extension to `` higher bv quantization '' in ",
    "[ subsec : aksz ] , where we also sketch how we expect our results to relate to the simplest examples of aksz theories .    afterwards , in  [ div ] , we discuss bv quantization from the perspective of physics  notably , how it is a homological version of integration  and explain how the standard approach relates to our work here .",
    "( a reader coming from a field theory setting might prefer to read that discussion before the preceding sections ; on the other hand , readers without such background should feel free to skip it , as nothing in the rest of the paper depends on it . )      as in the case of weyl quantization , our construction naturally breaks up into three steps : first we apply an analogue of the heisenberg lie algebra construction , then an enveloping algebra functor , and finally we `` set @xmath24 . ''",
    "these constructions are certainly well - known among those who work with bv quantization , although rarely articulated in this way , and they can be found , in a slightly different form , in @xcite and later in @xcite .    in the first step",
    "we start with a cochain complex @xmath7 over the base field @xmath25 , equipped with a 1-shifted antisymmetric pairing @xmath26 $ ]  we call such objects _ 1-shifted",
    "we then define a 1-shifted heisenberg lie algebra @xmath27 by equipping the cochain complex @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an added central element , with the bracket @xmath30 = \\omega(v , w)\\mathbf{c}$ ] for @xmath31 . unfortunately , this simple construction is not homotopically meaningful , which requires us to do a bit of work . in ",
    "[ sec : heis ] , we show :    for @xmath32 a commutative differential graded algebra over @xmath25 , let @xmath33 denote the of 1-shifted quadratic @xmath32-modules and @xmath34 the of 1-shifted lie algebras over @xmath32 .",
    "then there is a lax symmetric monoidal functor of @xmath35 that takes @xmath36 to a cofibrant replacement of @xmath27 .",
    "the construction is natural in @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , letting @xmath37 denote the of modules in @xmath38 over the abelian 1-shifted lie algebra @xmath39 , the induced functor @xmath40 is symmetric monoidal .    in the second step",
    "we apply an enveloping algebra functor .",
    "however , this no longer produces an associative algebra , but rather a _",
    "bd - algebra _ in the following sense :    [ def bd ] a _ beilinson - drinfeld ( bd ) algebra _ is a differential graded module @xmath41 over @xmath42 $ ] equipped with an @xmath14-linear unital graded - commutative product of degree zero and an @xmath14-linear shifted poisson bracket bracket of degree one such that @xmath43 for any @xmath44 in @xmath45 .",
    "bd - algebras can be encoded as algebras for an operad , and since we are working over a base field of characteristic zero , there are well - behaved model categories of such operad algebras . using this machinery",
    "we explicitly describe the bd - enveloping algebra of a 1-shifted lie algebra and show that it gives a symmetric monoidal functor of from @xmath34 to the @xmath46)$ ] of @xmath47-algebras in differential graded modules over @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "the second claim is not entirely obvious , since the model categories in question are not compatible with the tensor products in the usual sense .    in the weyl quantization story",
    ", we produced an associative algebra with a parameter @xmath14 . setting @xmath16 this algebra reduced to a poisson algebra , and setting @xmath24 it was the weyl algebra .",
    "hence the parameter @xmath14 explicitly describes a deformation quantization .",
    "interpreting the symplectic vector space as the _ phase space _ of a classical system , the weyl quantization procedure gave us both the classical observables  the poisson algebra of functions on the phase space , when @xmath16  and the quantum observables , when @xmath24 .    in the bv formalism",
    ", the classical observables form a 1-shifted poisson algebra , and the quantum observables are just a pointed cochain complex . starting with a bd - algebra @xmath45 over @xmath32",
    ", we can recover both of these structures by taking @xmath14 to be @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "if we set @xmath14 to @xmath49 , i.e. we pass to the quotient @xmath51 , then we obtain a shifted poisson algebra structure , which we interpret as the _ dequantization _ of the bd - algebra @xmath45 .",
    "if we set @xmath14 to @xmath50 , i.e. we pass to the quotient @xmath52 , then the differential is not a derivation and so up to quasi - isomorphism , the only remaining algebraic structure is the unit .",
    "that is , the reduction @xmath53 is essentially just a pointed @xmath32-module .",
    "more precisely , a pointed @xmath32-module is the same thing as an algebra in @xmath32-modules for an operad @xmath54 , and the structure we have on @xmath53 is encoded by an operad @xmath55 ; these operads are weakly equivalent , and so they encode the same kind of information .    the abstract problem of bv quantization is : given a shifted poisson algebra @xmath56 , produce a bd - algebra @xmath57 whose dequantization is quasi - isomorphic to @xmath56 .",
    "composing our shifted heisenberg functor with the bd - enveloping algebra , we thus get a functorial quantization procedure that abstracts and encodes the usual approach to bv quantization for linear systems .",
    "the shifted poisson algebra obtained from this quantization by setting @xmath16 can be identified with the enveloping shifted poisson algebra of the shifted lie algebra we started with . moreover , the @xmath55-algebra we get from taking @xmath58 is also an enveloping algebra .",
    "more formally , we can sum up our work on operads and enveloping algebras in  [ sec : opd ] as :    there is a commutative diagram of and symmetric monoidal functors @xmath59{urr}{u_{\\teo } } \\arrow[bend right]{drr}{u_{\\mathrm{p}_{0 } } } &      { \\mathcal{a}\\txt{lg}}_{\\txt{bd}}(a[\\hbar ] ) \\arrow{ur}{\\hbar = 1 } \\arrow{dr}{\\hbar = 0 }      \\\\       & & { \\mathcal{a}\\txt{lg}}_{\\mathrm{p}_{0}}(a ) ,    \\end{tikzcd}\\ ] ] that is natural in the commutative differential graded @xmath25-algebra @xmath32 .",
    "although not strictly needed for our main results , we take the time to prove some further interesting results concerning the symmetric monoidal enveloping functor @xmath60 .",
    "firstly , in ",
    "[ sec : ce ] we show that ( at the model category level ) it can be identified with ( a shifted version of ) the chevalley - eilenberg chains , which describe lie algebra homology . secondly , in  [ sec : enenv ] we use it to construct an _ enveloping @xmath61-algebra functor _ @xmath62 , by a different approach than those of fresse @xcite and knudsen @xcite .",
    "let us briefly sketch the idea : by using @xmath63-operads , we get from @xmath64 a functor between of @xmath65-algebras @xmath66 ( this approach does not work on the model category level ) ; using the bar / cobar adjunction , we then show that the @xmath67 is equivalent to @xmath68 , by an argument we learned from nick rozenblyum .",
    "in  [ subsec : bvstack ] we show that our functors all have natural extensions to derived stacks : for instance , given a quasi - coherent sheaf of 1-shifted quadratic modules on a derived stack , there is a functorial way to quantize it to a quasi - coherent sheaf of @xmath54-algebras .",
    "this result is essentially a formal consequence of the naturality of our constructions in the setting , together with lurie s descent theorem for of modules .",
    "this result begs the question of what such a quantization means in natural geometric examples , which we hope to explore in future work .",
    "for example , in light of @xcite , for a well - behaved 0-shifted symplectic stack @xmath69 , its relative tangent complex @xmath70 can be input to our construction .",
    "what does this quantization mean ?    in   [ subsec : quantk][subsec : quantsympvb ] we will focus on _ cotangent quantization _ , which sends a graded vector bundle @xmath7 ( i.e. a finite direct sum of shifts of vector bundles ) to the quantization of @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "this case has striking behaviour : the cotangent quantization of a graded vector bundle is a line bundle ( up to a shift ) . in other words ,",
    "this functor factors through @xmath72 , the stack of invertible sheaves , and hence it behaves likes a determinant functor .",
    "( it does not possess all the properties of the determinant , however . )",
    "this feature demonstrates a sense in which bv quantization is a kind of homological encoding of the path integral , since the determinant line of a vector space is the natural home for translation - invariant volume forms on the vector space .    from the viewpoint of physics , more specifically the divergence complex perspective that we discuss in section [ div ] below",
    ", this behavior is not too surprising .",
    "indeed , the standard toy example of bv quantization produces a cochain complex that is isomorphic to the polynomial de rham complex on a vector space @xmath7 , shifted down by the dimension of @xmath7 .",
    "poincar s lemma then tells us that we get a one - dimensional vector space in degree @xmath73 .",
    "we leverage this example as far as it can easily go .",
    "we expect this result to be true in somewhat greater generality , likely for 1-shifted symplectic vector bundles , which are quadratic modules whose pairing is non - degenerate and whose underlying module is a sum of shifts of vector bundles .",
    "for more general quasicoherent sheaves , however , the quantization is not invertible . on the other hand ,",
    "we show it is _ constructibly _ invertible in a certain sense . interpreting",
    "the meaning of this behavior is an intriguing question .",
    "we expect that it is closely related to recent work @xcite on vanishing cycles on stacks .",
    "( in a sense , the bv formalism is an obfuscated version of the twisted de rham complex , as explained in section [ div ] , and hence closely related to vanishing cycles . )      as we discussed above , we construct , for any derived stack @xmath69 , a sequence of symmetric monoidal functors",
    "@xmath74}{\\mathcal{a}\\txt{lg}}_{{\\txt{bd}}}(x ) \\to { \\mathcal{a}\\txt{lg}}_{\\teo}(x).\\ ] ] using @xmath63-operads , this sequence immediately induces functors between of @xmath0-algebras : @xmath75}{\\mathcal{a}\\txt{lg}}_{{\\txt{bd}}}(x ) ) \\to { \\mathcal{a}\\txt{lg}}_{\\mathrm{e}_{n}}(x).\\ ] ] we mentioned above that @xmath0-algebras in @xmath76 are equivalent to @xmath22-shifted lie algebras , and heuristically it looks like there is an analogous description of @xmath0-algebras in @xmath77 .",
    "more precisely , we expect the following :    [ conj : quaden ] there is a natural equivalence @xmath78 .",
    "the induced functor @xmath79 is a @xmath22-shifted version of the heisenberg lie algebra , so the composite functor @xmath80 is the @xmath0-enveloping algebra of the shifted heisenberg lie algebra .",
    "in fact , this construction has a further interesting extension .",
    "recall that given a nice symmetric monoidal @xmath81 , the _ higher morita category _ of @xmath65-algebras @xmath82 , as constructed in @xcite , is a symmetric monoidal @xmath83-category with    * objects @xmath65-algebras in @xmath81 , * 1-morphisms @xmath84-algebras in bimodules in @xmath81 , * 2-morphisms @xmath85-algebra in bimodules in bimodules in @xmath81 , *  * @xmath86-morphisms bimodules in  in bimodules in @xmath81 .    in  [ subsec : higherbv ] we show that the we work with satisfy the requirements for these higher morita categories to exist , and our functors give symmetric monoidal functors between them . in particular , we get _ higher bv quantization _",
    "functors @xmath87 .",
    "we expect that the @xmath88-morphisms in @xmath89 have an interesting interpretation , in the same way as we conjectured above for the objects .",
    "specifically , for @xmath90 they should be a cospan analogue of the linear version of the poisson morphisms studied by @xcite , and for @xmath91 we should have iterated versions of this notion .",
    "we have learned from nick rozenblyum that such results should be provable using the same techniques as in his unpublished proof that @xmath0-algebras in @xmath92-algebras are @xmath93-algebras .",
    "it is then attractive to guess that @xmath94 receives a symmetric monoidal functor from an @xmath83-category @xmath95 where    * objects are @xmath96-shifted symplectic @xmath32-modules , * 1-morphisms are lagrangian correspondences , * @xmath88-morphisms for @xmath91 are iterated lagrangian correspondences .",
    "heuristically , this functor simply takes duals  e.g. it would take an @xmath96-shifted symplectic @xmath32-module @xmath45 to its dual @xmath97 with its induced @xmath22-shifted pairing .",
    "the @xmath83-categories @xmath95 , or rather the more general version @xmath98 whose objects are @xmath25-shifted symplectic derived artin stacks , will be constructed in forthcoming work of the second author together with damien calaque and claudia scheimbauer .",
    "moreover , it will be shown there that the aksz construction , implemented in this algebro - geometric setting in @xcite , gives for every @xmath25-symplectic derived artin stack @xmath69 an extended oriented topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) @xmath99 ( where the dimension @xmath86 is arbitrary ) . combining this with our hypothetical dualizing functor , we would have for every @xmath96-shifted symplectic cochain complex @xmath69 a chain of symmetric monoidal functors of @xmath83-categories @xmath100 the resulting tqft can be interpreted as a _",
    "quantization _ of the aksz field theory with target @xmath69 .",
    "let s turn here to a more traditional presentation of linear bv quantization and interpret it as a hidden version of the de rham complex providing the connection to homological perspectives on integration .",
    "( for further discussion of bv quantization , we recommend @xcite . )",
    "let @xmath7 be a finite - dimensional vector space over , say , the real numbers .",
    "a standard way to encode the algebraic relations among integrals ( more accurately , integrands ) is via the de rham complex . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath101 is a smooth compact region  like a closed ball of codimension 0  then two top forms @xmath102 and @xmath103 satisfy @xmath104 hence top forms modulo exact terms encodes integrals modulo boundary integrals . we want to see what this perspective tells us about the integrals that represent toy models of the path integral .    the model case for physics is to fix a quadratic form @xmath105 on @xmath7 with a global minimum at the origin and consider the integrand @xmath106 . up to scale",
    ", this provides a probability measure on @xmath7 whose average is the origin and which extends around it as a `` bell curve '' .",
    "( on @xmath107 , this might be @xmath108 , which gives the gaussian measure as the integrand . )",
    "it is a toy model of a free theory in physics , with @xmath105 the action functional .",
    "( as @xmath105 is quadratic , its equations of motion are linear and so `` free . '' ) it is reasonable , in order to explore this measure , to focus on its _ moments _ ,",
    "i.e. to understand the integrals @xmath109 with @xmath110 a polynomial .",
    "indeed , the perturbative machinery of feynman diagrams can be understood as formally extending these computations to formal power series .",
    "our bv approach to this free case then similarly extends and provides another perspective on the origin of feynman diagrams as `` homotopy transfer '' .",
    "( see @xcite for more . ) in other words , we want to understand the expected value map @xmath111 note that these integrands decay very fast at infinity and hence are integrable .",
    "observe that this map factors as a composition @xmath112 the kernel of @xmath113 can be identified with those integrands @xmath114 that are exact , i.e. in the image of the de rham differential @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , the kernel of @xmath113 is the image of the `` divergence against the volume form @xmath116 '' operator @xmath117 sending a vector field @xmath69 with polynomial coefficients to the lie derivative of @xmath118 along @xmath69 .",
    "more generally we can use the volume form @xmath116 to produce an injection @xmath119 from the polyvector fields on @xmath7 with polynomial coefficients into de rham forms .",
    "the de rham differential preserves the image ( just note that the derivative of @xmath120 is a polynomial times itself ) and hence pulls back to a `` divergence operator '' @xmath121 on @xmath122 .    by construction ,",
    "this _ divergence complex _ @xmath123 encodes the moments of the measure @xmath118 in the map @xmath124 = \\mathbb{e}(p ) . \\end{array}\\ ] ] ( in this situation , the rest of the cohomology vanishes , by a poincar lemma argument . )",
    "hence it captures the information we most want from the measure .",
    "but this construction has several features that make it possible to generalize this approach to infinite - dimensional vector spaces and manifolds ( i.e. to actual field theories ) and also to derived settings , where the usual approaches to integration do not always work .",
    "two aspects are :    * it replaces the measure by the divergence operator , and so one can try to axiomatize the properties of divergence complexes and then search for new examples . in particular , it replaces questions about integration by examining relations between integrands . *",
    "it focuses on functions and their expected values  i.e. integration against a fixed volume form  rather than a general theory of integration .",
    "thus , by contrast to the de rham complex , it makes sense in infinite dimensions , whereas top forms make no sense there .    here we will focus on the first aspect , using an operad introduced by beilinson and drinfeld @xcite for the axiomatization , and introduce a wealth of examples from higher algebra and derived geometry .",
    "the second aspect is pursued wherever bv quantization is used in field theory , such as @xcite .",
    "of course , this bv approach to the path integral does not resolve all challenges !",
    "viewing integration this way loses some of the advantages of other perspectives and introduces new puzzles and challenges .",
    "let us now rapidly sketch the algebraic features of the divergence complex that we will focus on .",
    "first , polyvector fields have a natural graded - commutative product by wedging ( in parallel with de rham forms , but _ not _ preserved by the map @xmath125 ! ) .",
    "second , polyvector fields have a shifted poisson bracket , known as the schouten bracket , which is defined by extending the natural action of vector fields on functions and vector fields .",
    "explicitly , we define @xmath126\\ ] ] for @xmath127 a function and @xmath128 vector fields .",
    "( in general , there are signs to keep track of , due to the koszul sign rule , but we will not focus on that in this introduction . ) finally , the divergence operator is a derivation with respect to the bracket ( i.e. with respect to the shifted lie algebra structure ) but it is _ not _ a derivation with respect to the commutative product .",
    "instead , it satisfies the relation @xmath129 for any @xmath44 polyvector fields .",
    "( these features do not depend on the coefficients being polynomial and hold for holomorphic or smooth coefficients too . )",
    "this relation says that the bracket encodes the failure of @xmath130 to be a derivation .",
    "it should be seen as analogous to deformation quantization , where the failure to be commutative is encoded in the commutator bracket and , to first order in @xmath14 , this failure is the poisson bracket .",
    "this perspective leads directly to the definition of a beilinson - drinfeld algebra ( see definition [ def bd ] ) .    in our model case ,",
    "the shifted poisson algebra is @xmath131 ( note that the zeroth cohomology is precisely functions on the critical set of @xmath105 , which fits nicely with the fact that observables in a classical theory should be functions on the critical points of the action . )",
    "the bv quantization is @xmath132 , \\{q,-\\}+\\hbar \\triangle),\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is divergence against the lebesgue measure @xmath134 .",
    "( in formulas , one usually sees @xmath135 , where the @xmath136 are a basis for @xmath137 and the @xmath138 are the dual basis for @xmath139 $ ] . ) in this example , we explicitly see that the deformation of the differential amounts to taking into account the relations among integrands .",
    "there is one final thing to note about this model example , which makes manifest the analogy with weyl quantization .",
    "observe that the shifted poisson bracket @xmath140 is linear in nature .",
    "if we fix a basis @xmath141 for @xmath137 and a dual basis @xmath142 for @xmath7 , then @xmath143,\\ ] ] with @xmath144 and the @xmath136 s in degree zero and the @xmath138 s in degree one .",
    "the bracket is @xmath145 which looks just like a shifted version of the poisson bracket on the symplectic vector space @xmath146 .",
    "indeed , we can view this shifted bracket as arising from a shifted skew - symmetric pairing @xmath147)^{\\otimes 2 } \\to \\rr[1],\\ ] ] which is simply the restriction of @xmath140 to the linear space generating the graded - symmetric algebra of polyvector fields .",
    "there is then a shifted lie algebra @xmath148 given by centrally extending the abelian lie algebra @xmath149 $ ] by @xmath150 , i.e. @xmath151,\\ ] ] where the shifted lie bracket is @xmath152 = \\c \\omega(p , q).\\ ] ] thus @xmath148 is clearly a kind of shifted heisenberg lie algebra . to obtain the bv quantization , we do not take the universal enveloping algebra , which would produce an associative algebra , but instead take the enveloping bd algebra @xmath153 .",
    "( we construct this enveloping algebra functor in the text . ) the quotient @xmath154 recovers the standard bv quantization on the nose .      throughout this paper",
    ", we work in the setting of cochain complexes over a field @xmath25 of characteristic zero . in other words",
    ", everything is differential graded , aside from the occasional motivational remark .",
    "hence , when we speak about an algebra , we always mean an algebra object in some category ( or higher category ) with a forgetful functor to cochain complexes . after the introduction , we will simply speak about commutative or lie algebras and not differential graded commutative algebras or differential graded lie algebras .",
    "notationally , @xmath32 typically denotes a commutative algebra in cochain complexes over the field @xmath25 ( i.e. a cdga ) , and @xmath148 typically denotes a lie algebra in cochain complexes over @xmath25 ( i.e. a dgla ) .",
    "a module over an algebra always means a module object and we will not use the term differential graded module . thus we write @xmath32-module rather that differential graded @xmath32-module and so  on",
    ".    to construct our and functors we will also need to work with both model categories and simplicial categories . to distinguish the three kinds of mapping objects that arise we adopt the convention that for an ordinary category @xmath155 we write @xmath156 for the set of maps between objects @xmath157 and @xmath158 , for a simplicial category @xmath155 we write @xmath159 for the simplicial set of maps , and for an @xmath81 we write @xmath160 for the space of maps .    in many cases , we will have to work with a model category , a simplicial category and an that encode the same homotopy theory , and we use a typographical convention to distinguish these . for instance , there is a category @xmath161 of @xmath32-modules in @xmath162 , the category of cochain complexes over @xmath25 . there is also a simplicial category @xmath163 of ( cofibrant ) @xmath32-modules , and there is an @xmath164 of @xmath32-modules .",

    "there are two exceptions to the convention we just described .",
