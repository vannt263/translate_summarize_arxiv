    "about three years ago , padmanabhan suggested that the accelerated expansion of the universe is due to the difference between the surface degrees of freedom on the holographic horizon and the bulk degrees of freedom through a simple equation @xmath0 where v is the hubble volume in planck units and t is the cosmic time in planck units @xcite .",
    "up to date , many discussions have been done on the padmanabhan proposal @xcite .",
    "for example , in one paper , with the help of this idea , the friedmann equations of an ( n + 1)-dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker universe corresponding to general relativity , gauss - bonnet gravity , and lovelock gravity have been obtained @xcite . in another research ,",
    "the idea of treating the cosmic space as an emergent process has been applied to brane cosmology , scalar - tensor cosmology , and f(r ) gravity and the corresponding cosmological equations in these theories have been derived @xcite . in another investigation , using padmanabhan suggestion , author obtained the friedmann equations of universe not only in four dimensional space - time and einstein gravity , but also in higher dimensional space - time and other gravities like gauss - bonnet and lovelock gravity with any spacial curvature @xcite .",
    "some other authors , have extended the evolution equation in padmanabhan idea to give the friedmann equation in the nonflat universe corresponding to @xmath1 by taking into account the invariant volume surrounded by the apparent horizon @xcite . in another scenario , authors showed that applying padmanabhan s conjecture to non - einstein gravity cases encounters serious difficulties and has to be heavily modified to get the friedmann equation @xcite . in another paper ,",
    "author applied derived equations of universe in the padmanabhan model with the corrected entropy - area law that follows from generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) and obtain a modified friedmann equations due to the gup @xcite . and in more recent research , the padmanabhan idea has been constructed in bionic system and shown that all degrees of freedom inside and outside the universe are controlled by the evolutions of bion in extra dimension and tend to degrees of freedom of black f - string in string theory @xcite .",
    "the bion is a configuration of two branes which are connected by a wormhole @xcite .",
    "now , the main question arises as to what is the origin of difference between the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary surface and the one in a bulk ?",
    "to answer this question , we use the method in @xcite . in that paper , k fundamental strings decay to n pairs of m0-branes .",
    "then , these branes glue to each other and form an m3 , an anti - m3 and a wormhole between them .",
    "our universe is located on one of these branes and interact with other brane via the wormhole .",
    "extending this idea , we propose a new model which allows to construct our universe from m0-branes in m - theory . in this proposal , first , we will compactify m0-branes on one circle and obtain the relevant action for n d0-branes .",
    "then , we will show that these d0-branes may join to each other and make a transition to a d5-brane .",
    "next , we will compactify this d5- brane on two circle and derive the relevant actions for one d3-brane , two d1-branes and some extra energies .",
    "our universe is located on this d3-brane and two d1-branes are the main causes of inequality between number of degrees freedom on the surface horizon and in a bulk and occurring inflation and late - time acceleration . also , extra energies are responsible for happening of deceleration epoch .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ o1 ] , we will construct d0-brane from m0-brane and consider the relation between their algebra .",
    "we also show that d0-branes can join each other and form a d5-brane .",
    "then , we will compactify d5-brane on two circles and obtain one d3-brane and two d1-branes . in section [ o2 ]",
    ", we will show that the d1-brane which is more close to d3-brane dissolves in it and leads to inflation .",
    "also , in this section , we will argue that another d1-brane is the main cause of second phase of acceleration and inequality between number of degrees of freedom on the holographic surface and one in a bulk .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary and conclusion .",
    "in this section , we will show that the origin of universe is m0-branes . recently",
    ", some authors have proposed an action based on lie 3-algebras to describe m2-branes @xcite .",
    "some other authors have considered the case of infinite dimensional lie 3-algebras based on the nambu - poisson structure of three dimensional manifolds .",
    "they argued that the model contains self - dual 2-form gauge fields in 6 dimensions , and the result may be interpreted as the m5-brane world - volume action @xcite . extending these methods",
    ", we propose a new model which allows to construct our universe - brane from m0-branes . to this end , first , we obtain the relevant action for n m0-branes by replacing nambu - poisson structure of two dimensional manifolds in d - branes by the structure of three dimensional one . at second stage , we will compactify them on one circle and derive the action for n d0-brane .",
    "we show that n d0-branes join to each other , grow and form a d5-brane .",
    "then , this brane is compactified on two circles and our universe - brane and two d1-branes are created .",

    "it is clear that deceleration parameter is negative at present stage which is a signature of acceleration .",
    "this result is in agreement with recent experimental data and thus our model works .",
    "we constructed the padmanabhan idea in m - theory and argued that the birth and expansion of universe are controlled by the evolution of branes in extra dimensions . to this end , first , we obtained the relevant action for n m0-branes by replacing nambu - poisson structure of two dimensional manifolds in d - branes by the structure of three dimensional one . at second stage , we compactified them on one circle and derived the action for n d0-brane .",
    "we showed that n d0-branes join to each other , grow and form a d5-brane .",
    "then , we compactified this brane on two circles and obtained the action for our universe - brane , two d1-branes and some extra energies that are created due to this compactifications .",
    "next , we discussed that one of d1-branes which is more close to our universe - brane , dissolves in it , leads to an increase in difference between number of degrees of freedom on the holographic surface and bulk region and happening inflation era . after a short time",
    ", this d1-brane annihilates , the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary surface and bulk region become equal , inflation ends and deceleration epoch begins . during this era ,",
    "extra energies that are produced due to compactification are the main causes of expansion .",
    "finally , we argued that interaction of another d1-brane with our universe - brane leads to an inequality between degrees of freedom and occurring a new phase of acceleration .",
