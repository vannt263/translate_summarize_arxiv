    "for a long time , laboratory experiments and observations in space have been stirring up a dispute concerning the mechanisms of the magnetic - field evolution in plasma and the associated plasma dynamics .",
    "estimates of the plasma collisionality in plasma opening switches ( pos ) , for example , indicate that the magnetic field diffusion should be small while the plasma pushing by the magnetic - field pressure should be dominant .",
    "however , magnetic - field penetration has been observed in pos experiments  @xcite , and , moreover , it is found to be significantly faster than expected from diffusion  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic - field penetration was also found to be higher than , or of a comparable velocity to the plasma pushing . in an early experiment  @xcite a fast magnetic - field penetration into a plasma where the ions are nearly immobile",
    "was observed .",
    "this was explained by the generation of an electric hall field based on the electron magnetohydrodynamics theory  @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of the two governing processes , i.e. , the plasma pushing and the magnetic - field penetration , was further analyzed in a series of additional experiments with different plasma parameters , in which comprehensive measurements of spatial distributions of the magnetic field , of the ion velocity , and of the electron density in the plasma were performed .",
    "these detailed measurements , performed in multi - ion species plasma , have revealed that the fast magnetic field penetration into the plasma is accompanied by a specular reflection of the light - ion plasma and a slow pushing of the heavy - ion plasma penetrated by the field  @xcite , resulting in ion - species separation  @xcite .",
    "the electric field plays a crucial role in the interaction of the magnetic field with the plasma .",
    "the electric field transfers energy to the current - carrying plasma through the joule heating , the electric field that is generated by the space - charge separation due to the magnetic field accelerates the ions , and the ( hall ) electric field may induce the magnetic - field penetration into the plasma . however , previous studies of the electric fields in plasmas under application of pulsed currents ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) lacked the temporal and spatial resolutions and , thus , only provided an averaged view .    in this paper",
    "we describe an application of 3d - resolved spectroscopy to investigate the time evolution of electric fields in plasmas under high - current pulses .",
    "our method is based on laser spectroscopy combined with plasma doping by lithium , which allows for electric field measurements from the lithium emission - line shape . in the following sections we first discuss the physics underlying the diagnostic method and the measurements of the initial conditions of the plasma prior to the application of the current .",
    "then , measurements of the electric field in the plasma under a current pulse are described , followed by a discussion on the relation between the measured electric field , the magnetic field , and the plasma dynamics .",
    "it is found that the measured electric field magnitude is consistent with the hall electric field calculated on the basis of the magnetic field and the plasma density measured in a separate study .",
    "the stark effect has proven to be of a great utility for non - intrusive measurements of the frequency and amplitude of local electric fields in plasmas , as first suggested by baranger and mozer  @xcite and shortly later experimentally verified by kunze and griem  @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the lithium atomic system for electric fields measurements have been previously demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "lithium was employed for measurements of electric fields in dilute plasmas of gas discharges  @xcite and in the vacuum gap of a high - voltage diode  @xcite . in our experiment , high spatial and temporal resolutions in measuring the electric fields in relatively dense ( @xmath0 ) plasma are achieved . at such densities , extracting the information from the spectral line - profiles becomes more difficult due to the increased stark broadening and the faster ionization processes that reduce the neutral lithium line emission .",
    "the e - field diagnostic is based on the analysis of the line - shape of a forbidden transition and its intensity relative to an allowed transition .",
    "the neutral - lithium atomic system is most suitable for applying the method since the 2p-4f dipole - forbidden transition ( 4601.5   ) and the 2p-4d allowed transition ( 4603   ) are very close in wavelength , and therefore , both lines can be recorded simultaneously .",
    "this is particularly useful for investigating a highly transient plasma , such as the present one , where a reliable measurement requires obtaining the information on the e - field in a single discharge . in the presence of an electric field , a configuration mixing of the 4d and 4f levels",
    "occurs , making possible an electric dipole transition from the 4f level to the 2p level .",
    "since the 4d-4f mixing coefficient depends on the electric field amplitude , the intensity of the forbidden transition can serve as a measure of the electric field strength .",
    "the mixing coefficient is larger for smaller energy - level difference , thus the small energy separation between the 4f and the 4d levels ( @xmath1 ) makes these transitions in lithium suitable for measurements of relatively low electric field .",
    "the time dependence of the electric field magnitude and direction also affects the spectral line - profiles , and thus , using a detailed line - shape analysis allows for obtaining additional information on the frequency spectrum of the e - fields . in the case of a harmonic perturbation with frequency @xmath2 ,",
    "a dipole - forbidden transition is split into two satellites , displaced from the unperturbed position by @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "generally , for a non - harmonic perturbation the linewidth is roughly @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the typical field frequency .",
    "therefore , taking into consideration also the contributions of the doppler and instrumental broadenings to the total line widths , it is possible to conclude that for the present case of li i spectrum , the forbidden line would be unresolved from the strong allowed line for e - field frequencies above @xmath6 .",
    "our detailed modeling confirms this .    under the relevant plasma conditions the populations of the 4d and 4f levels are insufficient to produce strong spectral lines required for accurate measurements .",
    "laser - induced - fluorescence ( lif ) technique is employed to increase the 4d and 4f level populations by the laser pumping .",
    "pumping of these levels directly from the ground state ( 2s ) is inefficient since the 2s4d and 2s4f transitions are dipole - forbidden . instead",
    ", the laser emission is employed for pumping the 4p level from the ground state , and electron - collisional transfer from the 4p level leads to the increase of the 4d and 4f levels populations .",
    "the knowledge of the relative populations of the 4d and 4f levels is important for proper interpretation of the relative line intensities . due to the small energy separation between the 4d and 4f levels",
    ", it is expected that the electron - collision processes between these two levels dominate the relative populations of these levels , leading to a population distribution in accordance to the level statistical weights .",
    "this is verified by collisional - radiative calculations  @xcite .",
    "the collisional excitations and de - excitations from the pumped 4p level lead to an increased population also of the levels of the neighboring n=3 configuration .",
    "the resulting rise in the line intensities is advantageous , since different lines are used to obtain simultaneously both the stark and the doppler contributions to the line shapes .",
    "for example , due to the different sensitivity of the 4d and 3d states to the stark effect , a comparison of the 2p3d and 2p4d line shapes allows for inferring the doppler broadening and the rather small stark - broadening contribution to the 2p4d shape .        in the present experiments a lithium beam , produced by applying a nd :",
    "yag laser pulse onto a solid lithium target , is injected into the plasma region of interest .",
    "another laser beam , which is used for the pumping , intersects the lithium beam at the point of interest to produce the lif emission ( see fig .",
    "[ doping ] ) .",
    "the lithium beam density is so selected that it introduces a minimal disturbance in the region of diagnostics , while , on the other hand , is sufficient for yielding a satisfactory intensity of the desired transitions .        for the line - shape modeling , the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "this method is capable of calculating line shapes under the simultaneous effects of the plasma micro- and macro - fields ( both electric and magnetic ones ) . the forbidden transition from the @xmath7 to the @xmath8 level of",
    "is caused mostly by the 4f4d level mixing .",
    "the mixing of the 2p and 4f levels with other levels is negligible since the energy separations between these levels and 2p and 4f are significantly larger than the 4d4f separation .",
    "therefore , the 4f4d energy separation is crucial for an accurate modeling .",
    "we have measured its value independently  @xcite in order to resolve the ambiguity in light of the large spread in the values of this quantity in the available data sources .",
    "in this experiment we employ a coaxial plasma configuration , shown in fig .",
    "[ posdiag ] , in which plasma is initially injected to fill up the volume between the two coaxial electrodes .",
    "the cathode and anode diameters are 3.8 and 8.9 cm , respectively , and the plasma is injected over an axial length of 10 cm .",
    "a current pulse applied at one side of the coaxial line propagates through the plasma until the current channel reaches the vacuum section of the transmission line that is followed by a shorted end .",
    "this experimental configuration is commonly referred to as plasma opening switch ( see e.g.  @xcite and reference therein ) and has been recently used for studying the interaction of the plasma with the propagating magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the plasma prefill in the present experiment is produced by a flashboard plasma source and is injected inward through the transparent anode to fill up the a - k gap ( see fig .",
    "[ posdiag ] ) .",
    "the flashboard plasma with an electron density @xmath9 and electron temperature @xmath10  ev , almost uniform across the a - k gap , is mainly composed of protons and carbon ions ( mainly c iii - v ) .",
    "since the heavier carbon ions flow at lower velocities than the protons , the carbon / proton relative abundance decreases towards the cathode .",
    "the coaxial line is powered by an lc - water - line marx generator . a current pulse of @xmath11 with a rise time of @xmath12",
    "is then driven through the coaxial line .",
    "the upstream and downstream currents are measured by rogowski coils placed at the output of the water - line and at the shorted end .    in the diagnostic technique here employed ,",
    "the flashboard prefill plasma is doped with lithium using a laser - produced lithium beam ( see fig .",
    "[ poscross ] ) . for the generation of the lithium beam , a nd : yag laser pulse ( 6 ns ) is focused onto a surface of a metallic lithium target attached to one of the coaxial electrodes . the laser intensity was @xmath13 on the target surface .",
    "the particle velocities in the laser - produced plasma plume were found to be @xmath14 . at the distance of @xmath15 from the target , at which the electric field measurements are performed ,",
    "the density of the lithium beam was @xmath16 with an ionization degree of @xmath17 , i.e. , the electron density was @xmath18 .",
    "the electron temperature was @xmath19 ( see sec .",
    "[ optim ] ) . for the photopumping of the 4p state ,",
    "a tunable dye laser is used .",
    "this laser is pumped by an additional nd : yag laser pulse of 15  ns duration . in order to obtain the wavelength required for the photopumping ( @xmath20 ) , a wavelength extender for the generation of the second harmonic of the dye laser pulse is employed .",
    "thus , the dye laser is tuned to generate a pulse at @xmath21    ( using a solution of ` fluorescein  548 ` dye in methanol ) .",
    "the energy achieved at 2741.2    is @xmath221  mj . the laser spectral width is 0.2   .        for measurements where recording of accurate spectral line profiles are important , experimental conditions for which the doppler broadening is relatively small are preferable .",
    "the doppler broadening that affects the line shapes in these measurements results from the lithium atom velocities in the axial ( _ z _ ) direction ( along the line of sight ) . in order to minimize this effect",
    "it is required to use a sufficiently long time delay between the laser pulse for target evaporation and the current pulse application .",
    "the reason is that the lithium atoms ejected from the target surface due to the laser pulse move away from the surface with velocities varying along the plasma column produced .",
    "therefore , slow atoms reach the measurement region with longer delays .",
    "generally , lower velocities in the propagation direction normal to the target surface are correlated with lower velocities in the transverse directions , which enabled us to achieve a satisfactorily low doppler broadening in the axial direction . in the present experiment we used a time delay of 450  ns between the laser pulse employed for the target evaporation and the laser pulse employed for photopumping . selecting longer time - delays decreases the amount of the atoms due to the lithium ionization processes that take place in the prefill plasma , thereby , reducing the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "therefore , the optimal delay was determined according to the requirement of minimal doppler broadening but high enough signal intensity .",
    "the diagnostic system consists of two 1-m uv - visible spectrometers equipped with 2400  grooves / mm gratings ( see fig .",
    "[ posdiag ] ) .",
    "the output of one spectrometer is collected by an optical - fiber array and transmitted to 10 photomultiplier tubes that allow the recording of the line - profile time - dependence ( temporal resolution of 7  ns ) , while the output of the second spectrometer is recorded by a gated ( down to 5  ns ) intensified charge - coupled device ( iccd ) camera , allowing for recording single gated broadband spectra .",
    "the spectral resolutions of both systems are @xmath23    in the spectral range used .",
    "since the induced fluorescence originates from the region along the pumping - laser path , observing the emitted radiation perpendicular to the pumping - beam direction allows for measurements with a high spatial resolution in 3 dimensions . in this case the spatial resolution along the line of sight is determined by the width of the pumping laser beam , which is @xmath24 , whereas the resolution in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight is chosen by the spectrometer slit dimension ( sub - mm scale ) . a detailed discussion of the spectral calibration and the determination of the instrumental response of the system can be found in ref .",
    "the measurements are performed in three stages . in the first stage",
    "we characterize the laser - produced lithium plasma used as a dopant . in principle",
    ", the dopant plasma could perturb the local conditions of the main prefill plasma , introducing uncertainties in the measurements . in order to minimize this perturbation ,",
    "the dopant density must be kept lower than that of the main plasma . however , lowering the lithium density results in weakening the spectral lines of interest , thereby reducing the signal - to - noise ratio that is crucial for resolving the spectral profiles required for the determination of the electric field . to optimize the  dopant density ,",
    "measurements of the lithium density , ionization degree , and expansion velocity were first performed with no plasma prefill .    in the second stage , with the optimal configuration of the lithium doping ,",
    "the electric fields are measured in the plasma prefill ( still without the application of the current pulse ) .",
    "these experiments yield the initial level of the electric field present in the plasma prior to the application of the current pulse .",
    "we refer to this field as a `` background '' electric field .",
    "finally , we measure the evolution of the electric fields generated during the conduction of the pulsed current .",
    "details of the measurements aimed at the diagnostics of the laser - produced lithium beam will be published separately  @xcite . here",
    ", we briefly describe the main results .",
    "measurements were performed to determine the temporal evolution of the plasma parameters in the lithium beam at different distances from the target for various laser intensities in the range of @xmath25 - @xmath26    a typical  spectrum in the wavelength range of interest ( 4603   ) , obtained at a distance of 2.5  mm from the target , is presented in fig .",
    "[ profile_las ] .",
    "it is recorded by the iccd camera with a time - gate of 10  ns correlated with the peak of the lif signal .",
    "the figure shows the measured and simulated line shapes of the allowed 2p-4d and the nearby forbidden 2p-4f transitions . the line shape simulation , similar to that described in ref .",
    "@xcite , show the individual contribution of each of the three broadening mechanisms : the stark effect , doppler , and instrumental .",
    "the doppler broadening can be estimated from the  velocities obtained from time - of - flight measurements .",
    "for the present measurements we used a time delay of 450 ns between the evaporating laser pulse and the photopumping laser pulse . at a distance of 2.5  mm from the electrode",
    "this delay corresponds to a velocity of @xmath27 .",
    "since the  plume expands into a large solid angle , the transverse velocities are of the order of the longitudinal velocities .",
    "indeed , a doppler broadening of 2  ev , consistent with the velocities mentioned above , is obtained by deconvolving the known instrumental broadening function from the total line shape of the  2p3d transition ( 6104   ) that is insensitive to the stark effect under the present conditions .",
    "subsequently , the stark - broadened spectrum for various values of the electron density @xmath28 is calculated , and convolved with the instrumental and the doppler broadening functions . for these calculations",
    ", we used @xmath29 , adopted from the results of a collisional - radiative modeling of the temporal behavior of the  line intensities ( described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .        from the line - shape calculations",
    "it is found that the measured spectrum can not be satisfactorily fitted for any electron density .",
    "a good fit is rather obtained by assuming a combination of @xmath30 and low frequency ( @xmath31 ) oscillations with an amplitude of @xmath32 ( see fig .",
    "[ profile_las ] ) .",
    "although assuming a higher electron density of @xmath33 ( with no waves in the plasma ) provides a satisfactory fit to the total intensity ratio of the allowed line to the forbidden line , the width of the 2p-4f line becomes significantly larger due to the wide spectrum of the microfield amplitudes under this assumption .",
    "this results in flattening of the forbidden peak , which is in disagreement with the observations .",
    "we now describe the experiments in which the lithium beam is locally injected into the flashboard plasma that prefills the inter - electrode gap ( still , without applying the main pulsed - current ) .",
    "the lithium target is attached to the cathode ( the inner electrode , see fig .",
    "[ poscross ] ) .",
    "the plasma prefill parameters were obtained in a previous work from emission spectroscopy  @xcite . the plasma is found to have a nearly uniform electron density across the inter - electrode gap with @xmath34 and @xmath35 . under these conditions",
    "the lithium atoms undergo substantial ionization and the density of neutral lithium arriving at the observation point is expected to be significantly lower than when the dopant is injected into vacuum , leading to reduced line intensities .",
    "indeed , the intensity of the  4603-line in the plasma prefill is found to be an order of magnitude lower than when the lithium beam is expanding in vacuum . nevertheless , this intensity is still sufficient to provide a signal - to - noise ratio that is adequate for resolving the line profiles of interest . in these experiments",
    "the 2p-3d line is not useful for measuring the doppler broadening since its upper level is no longer populated from the decay of the @xmath36  levels , as the latter are significantly depopulated through collisional ionization due to the higher prefill plasma density . instead",
    ", here we use the 2s-2p line at 6708    that is also insensitive to the stark effect .",
    "this line exhibits somewhat larger doppler width than in the case of expansion into vacuum , corresponding to a temperature of @xmath37 .        in fig .",
    "[ fb_2p-4d ] we present a comparison of the profiles of the allowed 2p4d and the forbidden 2p4f lines emitted when the lithium beam is expanding in vacuum with those emitted with the flashboard plasma prefill .",
    "it is clearly seen that in the presence of the flashboard plasma the forbidden line has a substantially higher relative intensity and both lines are relatively broadened .",
    "similarly to the previous case , also here we find that electric microfields , arising from the thermal electrons and ions , can not explain the observations .",
    "the best fit is obtained by considering a combination of micro electric fields due to @xmath38 and the presence of a low frequency electric field of @xmath39 .",
    "we note that under these higher density conditions , the line profiles are less sensitive to the density , but the inferred density range agrees well with that found in a previous work  @xcite .",
    "the simulations also give an upper limit for the oscillation frequency of the additional electric field , @xmath40 .",
    "this upper limit is of the order of @xmath41 of the flashboard plasma , indicating that these oscillations can possibly be of the ion - acoustic type .",
    "similar e - field intensities were measured in several positions , particularly in the positions where the e - field measurements were performed during the current application , as described in the next paragraph .",
    "we take this observed electric field of @xmath42 to be the upper limit of the collective fields present in the plasma prefill prior to the application of the high - current pulse ; hereafter referred to as the `` background '' electric field .        for performing measurements of electric fields also in the vicinity of the anode",
    ", the lithium target is attached to the anode and the evaporating laser beam is focused onto the target through a port in the vacuum chamber at the opposite side of the anode .",
    "the two different setups , allowing for measurements in the vicinity of the cathode and the anode , are schematically described in fig .",
    "[ beam_injection ] .",
    "since the flashboard plasma source is located on an outside cylinder and its plasma flows radially inward , attaching the dopant - lithium target to the anode results in evaporated li atoms flowing mostly in the same direction as the flashboard plasma flow , whereas when the li target is attached to the cathode , the li atoms flow opposite to the direction of the flashboard plasma flow .",
    "the line profiles obtained near the anode are compared to those obtained near the cathode .",
    "the comparison of the line profiles is performed for azimuthal and radial polarizations ( the line of sight is along the axial direction ) .",
    "interestingly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fb_pol ] , the change of the dopant injection direction with respect to the flashboard plasma flow is found to affect the line profiles only in the azimuthal polarization .",
    "for the azimuthal polarization , the 2p4f forbidden - line intensity is noticeably higher for the case where the dopant  atoms are injected opposite to the direction of the flow of the flashboard plasma ( measurements near the cathode ) , while for the radial polarization the line profiles are found to be similar for the two cases of the dopant injection .",
    "the explanation for this effect is not clear yet . for the e - field measurements in the present study only the radial - polarization line - emission is used , for which no effect of the switching of the lithium injection direction on the line shapes is observed .",
    "knowledge of the effect of the prefill plasma on the dopant lithium line shapes and the corresponding electric fields allows for investigating the electric fields formed during the flow of the pulsed - current in the plasma .",
    "the measurements are performed at a distance of 2.5  mm from the electrodes ( either the cathode or the anode ) inside the inter - electrode gap at different axial positions .",
    "the field of view of the optical system covers a region between 2.2 and 2.8  mm from the electrodes .",
    "we note that estimates of the maximal sheath size give a much smaller distance from the electrodes , based on the known system inductance and the measured current .",

    "the product of the field rise - time and the propagation velocity gives an estimate of the axial scale of the changes of the electric field .",

    "this is plausible due to the lower b - field near the anode and the higher fraction of heavy ions , since the latter leads to a higher electron density following the reflection of the protons by the propagating magnetic front .",

    "the relatively large deviation seen for point * 1 * can possibly be explained by the more pronounced @xmath100 drop observed at this point , which may reduce the turbulent background e - field , contrary to our assumption in the model that the background field is constant .",
    "such a good agreement between the experimentally measured electric field and the calculated hall electric field , based on the b - field and density measurements , as shown in fig .",
    "[ evsmodel ] , suggests that the observed e - field is most likely the hall field , generated by the current .",
    "although a thorough understanding of the field evolution requires a self - consistent modeling that , for example , would also consider the ion reflection and species separation observed in the experiment , this agreement indicates that the hall field could play a crucial role in the magnetic field penetration .",
    "the model discussed here predicts the e - field near the anode ( point  * 4 * ) to be a factor of 4 lower than that near the cathode at point  * 1 * ( b - field drops by a factor of 2 near the anode , see table [ param_table ] ) , in disagreement with the measurements ( see fig .",
    "[ e - field_anodevscathode ] ) .",
    "a possible explanation is a rise of the turbulence near the anode during the current flow . in order to test this explanation",
    ", one could measure the axial velocities of the accelerated ions both near the anode and near the cathode . since the ions accelerate axially mostly due to the hall - field ,",
    "if indeed the electric field is mostly turbulent near the anode then the axial ion velocities near the anode will be substantially lower than they are near the cathode , but the velocity distribution will be much broader .    the contribution of the ion motion to the electric field in ohm s law ( the second term of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ ohms_law ] ) ) is small .",
    "this contribution can be estimated by comparing @xmath105 to @xmath106 . approximating the magnitude of the current density by @xmath107 , using the measured ion velocities from ref .",
    "@xcite , and assuming the ions are accelerated in the direction perpendicular to the b - field front , we find the contribution of the convective term in eq .",
    "( [ ohms_law ] ) to be much smaller than the contribution of the hall term . if instead of using the measured ion velocities we use the mhd velocity @xmath108 ( where @xmath109 is the mass density ahead of the current front ) as the maximal ion velocity , we find that the contribution of the hall term is larger than that of the ion motion as long as @xmath110 ( the effective ion skin depth ) .",
    "here , @xmath111 yields an effective ion skin depth of @xmath112 that is much larger than @xmath113 ( the current - channel width observed in the experiments ) , thus the ion term is expected to be smaller .      as suggested in sec .",
    "[ sec_fb ] , the background electric field may be attributed to an ion - acoustic instability in the plasma . in this case , this electric field should cause a relatively strong electron collisionality in the plasma prior to the application of the current . here",
    "we describe the effect of such a strong collisionality on the magnetic - field evolution and the current distribution .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective collision frequency @xmath114 associated with the ion - acoustic turbulent electric fields in the plasma is : @xmath115 assuming that the turbulent e - field is of the order of the background e - field of @xmath42 measured prior to the current application , and using @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( @xmath118 being the upper limit of the electron temperature in the plasma prefill ) , the expected collision frequency is @xmath119 .",
    "this frequency is much higher than spitzer s collision frequency , which for the above parameters is @xmath120 .",
    "such a high collision frequency is expected to increase the rate of magnetic field penetration into the plasma and also to broaden the current channel .    in spite of",
    "the relatively high anomalous collision frequency suggested here , it is still insufficient to explain the fast b - field penetration by diffusion that requires collision frequency of about @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "in addition , step - like spatial profile of the magnetic field is inconsistent with the exponential decay predicted by diffusion . a different mechanism , such as the hall - field induced mechanism @xcite , is thus expected to cause the fast magnetic field penetration .",
    "still , the high anomalous collision frequency may help to explain the observed broad current - channel , not understood thus far . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in a steady hall - induced penetration the current - channel width is estimated to be : @xmath122where @xmath123 is the alfvn velocity of electrons , @xmath124 ( @xmath125 is the electron mass ) , and @xmath126 is the inter - electrode spacing .",
    "although in the present experiment the plasma and field dynamics do not reach a steady state , we use this relation to obtain an estimate for the current - channel width , assuming hall - induced penetration . for @xmath127 and the anomalous collision frequency estimated above , we find that @xmath128 .",
    "this value is an order of magnitude larger than the electron skin - depth @xmath129 and consistent with the measurements  @xcite used for our model ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "thus , while the anomalous collision frequency estimated from the turbulent electric fields is insufficient to explain the rate of magnetic field penetration , it does explain reasonably well the current channel width .",
    "we note that in a previous investigation  @xcite it was concluded otherwise , based on an estimated upper level of a @xmath131 electric field .",
    "however , in that experiment the plasma source was a plasma gun rather than a surface flashover as in the present work .",
    "also , the previous e - field measurements might have been related to a secondary plasma , since they were based on hydrogen line - emission that also originated at electrode sputtering  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous collision frequency predicted above is about three times higher than the minimal collision frequency required for a collisional current channel dominated by the hall - field penetration  @xcite , @xmath132 $ ] , which is estimated to be @xmath133 this further supports the possibility of a hall - field induced magnetic - field penetration .",
    "we note that for @xmath134 the value of @xmath114 is larger than the electron gyrofrequency , meaning there is no electron magnetization and the resistive term ( the third term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ ohms_law ] ) ) is thus dominant in determining the electric field at the beginning of the current conduction .",
    "therefore , the hall mechanism is not applicable in these conditions .",
    "the collisionality , though rather high , also can not explain the velocity of the magnetic field penetration at this early stage of the pulse and the question regarding the mechanism of the initial magnetic field penetration remains open .",
    "for the first time the electric fields in current - carrying plasmas are measured with high spatial and temporal resolutions .",
    "this is achieved by a diagnostic method that is based on line - shape analysis of dipole - forbidden transitions combined with laser spectroscopy .",
    "the measured electric fields exhibit a good agreement with the hall field calculated using measurements of the time - dependent magnetic - field and density distributions in the current - carrying plasma .",
    "these results indicate that in the present experiment the hall mechanism can be dominant in the magnetic field penetration into the plasma . moreover , it is noteworthy that the modeled hall field , which depends linearly on @xmath135 , reproduces well the present e - field measurements , particularly in light of the sharp density drop observed due to the ion - species separation phenomenon .",
    "it is important to note , however , that in order to further conclude that the hall electric field induces the magnetic field penetration , as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is yet to be shown that the evolution of the electric fields must be consistent with the magnetic field propagation in accordance with faraday s law : @xmath136    a rather high level of the electric field ( @xmath137  kv / cm ) is observed in the plasma prefill prior to the pulsed current application",
    ". such electric fields , if present in the entire prefill plasma , may give rise to an anomalous collisionality that is consistent with the hall mechanism and may help explaining the observed current channel width . a clarification of this effect and the nature of this possible turbulence",
