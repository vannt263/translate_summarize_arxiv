    "there is growing evidence in cosmology for the existence of nearly massless scalar fields in our universe .",
    "on the one hand , a host of observations , from supernovae luminosity - distance measurements  @xcite to the cosmic microwave background anisotropy  @xcite , suggests that 70% of the current energy budget consists of a dark energy fluid with negative pressure .",
    "while observations are consistent with a non - zero cosmological constant , the dark energy component is more generally modeled as quintessence : a scalar field rolling down a flat potential  @xcite . in order for the quintessence field to",
    "be evolving on cosmological time scales today , its mass must be of order @xmath0 , the present hubble parameter .",
    "on the other hand , recent measurements of absorption lines in quasar spectra suggest that the fine - structure constant @xmath2 has evolved by roughly one part in @xmath3 over the redshift interval @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "time - variation of coupling constants are generally modeled with rolling scalar fields  @xcite , and the recent evidence for a time - varying @xmath2 requires the mass of the corresponding scalar field to be of order @xmath0  @xcite .    in either case , the inferred scalar field is essentially massless on solar system scales , and therefore subject to tight constraints from tests of the equivalence principle ( ep )  @xcite .",
    "the current bound on the e@xmath5tv@xmath5s parameter , @xmath6 , which quantifies the deviation from the universality of free - fall , is @xmath7 , from the e@xmath5t - wash experiment  @xcite .    from a theoretical standpoint ,",
    "massless scalar fields or moduli are abundant in string and supergravity theories . indeed ,",
    "generic compactifications of string theory result in a plethora of massless scalars in the low - energy , four - dimensional effective theory .",
    "however , these massless fields generally couple directly to matter with gravitational strength , and therefore lead to unacceptably large violations of the ep . therefore ,",
    "if the culprit for quintessence or time - varying @xmath2 is one of the moduli of string theory , some mechanism must effectively suppress its ep - violating contributions .",
    "for instance , damour and polyakov  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) have proposed a dynamical mechanism to suppress the coupling constants @xmath8 between the various matter fields and the dilaton of string theory .",
    "alternatively , the suppression could be the result of approximate global symmetries  @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite , we presented a scenario in which scalar fields can evolve cosmologically while having couplings to matter of order unity , _ i.e. , _ @xmath9 .",
    "this is because the scalar fields acquire _ a mass whose magnitude depends on the local matter density_. in a region of high density , such as on earth , the mass of the fields is large , and thus the resulting violations of the ep are exponentially suppressed . in the solar system , where the density is much lower ,",
    "the moduli are essentially free , with a compton wavelength that can be much larger than the size of the solar system . finally , on cosmological scales , where the density is very low , the mass can be of the order of the present hubble parameter , thereby making the fields potential candidates for causing the acceleration of the universe or the time - evolution of the fine - structure constant .",
    "while the idea of density - dependent mass terms is not new  @xcite , the novelty of our work lies in that the scalar fields can couple directly to baryons with gravitational strength .    in our scenario , scalar fields that have cosmological effects , such as quintessence ,",
    "do not result in large violations of the ep in the laboratory because we happen to live in a very dense environment .",
    "thus , the main constraint on our model is that the mass of the field be sufficiently large on earth to evade ep and fifth force constraints  @xcite .    the generation of a density - dependent mass for a given modulus @xmath10 results from the interplay of two source terms in its equation of motion .",
    "the first term arises from self - interactions , described by a monotonically - decreasing potential @xmath11 which is of the runaway form ( see fig .  [ pot ] ) .",
    "in particular , we underscore the fact that the potential need not have a minimum ; rather , it must be monotonic .",
    "the second term arises from the conformal coupling to matter fields , of the form @xmath12 . the coupling constants @xmath8 need not be small , however , and values of order unity or greater are allowed .",
    "although these two contributions are both monotonic functions of @xmath10 , their combined effect is that of an effective potential which does display a minimum ( see fig .",
    "[ poteff ] ) . furthermore , since this effective potential depends explicitly on the local matter density @xmath13 , both the field value at the minimum and the mass of small fluctuations depend on @xmath13 as well , with the latter being an increasing function of the density .",
    "although the scalar fields are quite massive on earth , their behavior is strikingly different in the solar system where the local matter density is much smaller .",
    "thus our model makes a crucial prediction for near - future experiments that will test gravity in space .",
    "for example , consider the see project  @xcite which among other things will measure newton s constant to an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "our scenario generically predicts that the see experiment should observe corrections of order unity to newton s constant compared to its measured value on earth , due to fifth - force contributions which are important in space but exponentially suppressed on earth .",
    "moreover , three satellite experiments to be launched in the near future , step  @xcite , galileo galilei ( gg )  @xcite and microscope  @xcite , will test the universality of free - fall in orbit with expected accuracy of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we predict that these experiments should observe a strong ep - violating signal .",
    "in fact , for a wide range of parameters , our model predicts that the signal will be larger than the ground - based e@xmath5t - wash bound of @xmath17 .",
    "if see does measure an effective newton s constant different from that on earth , or if step observes an ep - violating signal larger than thought permitted by the e@xmath5t - wash experiment , this will strongly indicate that a mechanism of the form proposed here is realized in nature .",
    "for otherwise it would be hard to explain the discrepancies between measurements in the laboratory and those in orbit .",
    "these new and surprising outcomes are a direct consequence of the fact that scalar fields in our model have drastically different behavior in regions of high density than in regions of low density .",
    "we refer to @xmath10 as a `` chameleon '' field , since its physical properties , such as its mass , depend sensitively on the environment",
    ". moreover , in regions of high density , the chameleon `` blends '' with its environment and becomes essentially invisible to searches for ep violation and fifth force .",
    "even though we predict significant violations of the ep in space , all existing constraints from planetary orbits  @xcite , such as those from lunar laser ranging  @xcite , are easily satisfied in our model .",
    "this is because of the fact that the chameleon - mediated force between two large objects , such as the earth and the sun , is much weaker than one would naively expect . to see this , we use calculus and break up the earth into a collection of infinitesimal volume elements .",
    "consider one such volume element located well - within the earth .",
    "since the mass of the chameleon is very large inside the earth , the @xmath10-flux from this volume element is exponentially suppressed and therefore contributes negligibly to the @xmath10-field outside the earth .",
    "this is true for all volume elements within the earth , except for those located in a thin shell near the surface .",
    "infinitesimal elements within this shell are so close to the surface that they do not suffer from the bulk exponential suppression .",
    "thus , the exterior field is generated almost entirely by this thin shell , whereas the bulk of the earth contributes negligibly .",
    "a similar argument applies to the sun .",
    "consequently , the chameleon - mediated force between the earth and the sun is suppressed by this thin - shell effect , which thereby ensures that solar system tests of gravity are satisfied",
    ".    however , note that this only applies to large objects , such as planets .",
    "sufficiently small objects do not suffer from thin - shell suppression , and thus their entire mass contributes to the exterior field . in particular , a small satellite in orbit , such as see , may not exhibit a thin - shell effect .",
    "this is why the orbits of the planets are essentially unaffected by the @xmath10-force , whereas the fifth force between two test particles in the see capsule is significant .",
    "since @xmath10 couples directly to matter fields , all mass scales and coupling constants of the standard model depend on space and time . once again due to the thin - shell mechanism described above , spatial variations of constants are sufficiently small in our model to satisfy current experimental bounds , for instance from the vessot - levine experiment  @xcite .",
    "time variation of coupling constants are also not a problem since , during most of the history of the universe , the various couplings actually change by very little .",
    "thus the bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis , for instance , are easily satisfied .",
    "this will be described in more detail in a separate paper dealing with the cosmological evolution in our model  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ setups ] , we describe the ingredients of the scenario , focusing on a single modulus @xmath10 for simplicity .",
    "we show how the dynamics of @xmath10 are governed by an effective potential that depends on the local matter density . in sec .",

    "we then show in sec .",
    "[ condmass ] that , for a potential of power - law form , @xmath18 , these constraints translate into the requirement that the energy scale @xmath19 be less than an inverse millimeter or so .",

    "[ solar ] , we argue that our model easily satisfies constraints from solar system tests of gr . it is showed ( sec .",
    "[ sep ] ) that the same holds true for bounds from spatial and time variation of coupling constants .",
    "we then predict ( sec .  [ satellite ] )",
    "that near - future experiments that aim at testing the ep and measuring a fifth force should observe a large signal , perhaps stronger than previously thought possible .",

    "[ conclu ] .",
    "focusing on a single scalar field @xmath10 for simplicity , the action governing the dynamics of our model is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath22 is the determinant of the metric @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the ricci scalar and @xmath25 are matter fields .",
    "the scalar field @xmath10 interacts directly with matter particles through a conformal coupling of the form @xmath12 .",

    "the above conditions on the asymptotics of @xmath33 are generally satisfied by potentials arising from non - perturbative effects in string theory  @xcite .",
    "note that it is also of the desired form for quintessence models of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath10 derived from the above action is then @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the stress - energy tensor for the @xmath36th form of matter . for the purpose of this paper",
    ", it will suffice to approximate the geometry as minkowski space , that is , @xmath37 .",
    "this is valid provided that the newtonian potential is small everywhere , and that the backreaction due to the energy density in @xmath10 is also small .",
    "this latter assumption will be justified when we analyze post - newtonian corrections in sec .",
    "[ ppn ] .    for non - relativistic matter , one has @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the energy density .",
    "however , we shall find it convenient to express our equations not in terms of @xmath39 , but rather in terms of an energy density @xmath40 which is conserved in einstein frame .",
    "in other words , @xmath41 is defined so that it is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "equation  ( [ eom0 ] ) thus reduces to @xmath42    from the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) , we see that the dynamics of @xmath10 are not solely governed by @xmath11 , but rather by an effective potential @xmath43 which depends explicitly on the matter density @xmath41 . in particular ,",

    "since @xmath49 is negative and monotonically increasing , while @xmath56 is positive and decreasing , it also follows that larger values of @xmath41 correspond to smaller @xmath52 and larger @xmath55 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lrhosrho ] .",
    "the denser the environment , the more massive is the chameleon .",
    "we will later see that it is possible for @xmath55 to be sufficiently large on earth to evade current constraints on ep violations and fifth force , while being sufficiently small on cosmological scales for @xmath10 to have interesting cosmological effects .",
    "the upshot of our model , from a theoretical standpoint , is that the potential @xmath11 need not have a minimum , nor does the coupling constant @xmath46 need be tuned to less than @xmath57 to satisfy ep constraints  @xcite .",
    "quite the contrary , @xmath11 is assumed monotonic , while @xmath46 can be of order unity .",
    "in order to study the observable consequences of our model , in particular with regards to ep violations and fifth force mediation , we must first understand the profile that @xmath10 acquires on earth and in the solar system .",
    "therefore , in this section , we derive an approximate solution for @xmath10 in the case where the source is a compact object , which we idealize as being perfectly spherical and having homogeneous density .    thus consider a static , spherically - symmetric body of radius @xmath58 , homogeneous density @xmath59 and total mass @xmath60 . in the case of the earth",

    "it is not in vacuum , however , but is instead immersed in a background of homogeneous density @xmath62 . in the case of solar system objects ,",
    "this models the fact that our local neighborhood of the galaxy is not empty , but rather filled with an approximately homogeneous component of baryonic gas and dark matter with density @xmath63 . in the case of a baseball in the earth s atmosphere , @xmath62 denotes the surrounding atmospheric density : @xmath64 .    with these assumptions , eq .",

    "moreover , this assumption will be dropped when we derive the resulting violations of the ep in sec .",

    "in the end we are not assuming that the theory is brans - dicke  @xcite .    throughout the analysis ,",

    "equation  ( [ sun1 ] ) is a second order differential equation and as such requires two boundary conditions .",
    "since the solution must be non - singular at the origin , we require @xmath74 at @xmath75 , as usual .",
    "moreover , since @xmath76 at infinity , it is natural to impose @xmath77 as @xmath78 .",
    "this latter condition is physically sensible as it implies @xmath79 as @xmath78 , and thus that the @xmath10-force between the compact object and a test particle tends to zero as their separation becomes infinite . to summarize , eq .",

    "there are then two types of solution , depending on whether the object is large ( _ e.g. _ , the earth ) or small ( _ e.g. _ , a baseball ) .",

    "let us describe the exterior solution ( @xmath70 ) for large bodies , assuming @xmath86 for simplicity .",
    "for this purpose , it is convenient to break up the object into infinitesimal volume elements @xmath87 and consider their individual contribution to the @xmath10-field .",
    "well - within the object , one has @xmath84 , and the mass of the chameleon is large , @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the contribution from a volume element @xmath87 within the core is proportional to @xmath89 and is therefore exponentially suppressed . in other words , it contributes negligibly to the @xmath10-field outside .",
    "this holds for all infinitesimal volume elements within the object , except for those lying within a thin shell of thickness @xmath90 near the surface  @xcite .",
    "see fig .",

    "we first show that it is possible for the satellite _ not _ to have a thin shell .",
    "this is desirable in this case in order to maximize the signal .",
    "that is , we derive the conditions under which @xmath318 holds for the see capsule .",

    "this implies , therefore , that the see satellite will measure an effective newton s constant , @xmath333 , _ which differs by order unity from newton s constant measured on earth_.    since this is an important prediction , let us summarize how it was obtained .",
    "first of all , the key ingredient is that the see experiment is performed in orbit , where the range of @xmath10-mediated interactions is greater than 10 au .",
    "thus , small perturbations in @xmath10 are essentially massless on the scale of the capsule , and therefore the force law between two test bodies is proportional to @xmath268 to a very good approximation .",
    "a second crucial condition is that there is no thin - shell effect within the satellite , as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ noscreen ] ) .",
    "this ensures that there is no suppression of the fifth force , and the coupling strength is therefore of order @xmath334 .",
    "hence , for @xmath46 of order unity , the effective newton s constant receives large corrections from the fifth force mediated by @xmath10 . as mentioned earlier , such an outcome would constitute strong evidence that a mechanism of the kind we are proposing is at play in nature .",

    "hence , there is no thin - shell effect if eq .",
    "( [ noscreen ] ) holds , and the @xmath10 profile within the satellite is well - approximated by eq .",
    "( [ earthext ] ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that the e@xmath5tv@xmath5s parameter for be and nb test cylinders , as appropriate for step , is given by @xmath337 combining with eq .",
    "( [ atmgg ] ) , we find the allowed range @xmath338 which falls almost entirely within the range of sensitivity of step .",
    "moreover , we see that @xmath46 can be larger than @xmath17 , the current bound from experiments performed on earth  @xcite . in other words , it is possible that microscope , gg and step will measure violations of ep stronger than currently thought to be allowed by laboratory measurements .",
    "this is another striking manifestation of the fact that scalar field dynamics in our model are very different on earth than in orbit .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a novel scenario in which both the strength and the range of interactions mediated by a scalar field @xmath10 depend sensitively on the surrounding environment . in a region of high density , such as on earth ,",
    "the mass of the scalar field is sufficiently large , typically of order 1 @xmath339 , to evade constraints on ep violation from laboratory experiments .",
    "meanwhile , the field can be essentially free on solar system scales , with a typical compton wavelength of 100 au .",
    "we have argued that our scenario satisfies all existing bounds from ground - based and solar - system tests of gravity .",
    "it will be left for future work to study our model in the context of strongly gravitating systems , such as black holes  @xcite .",
    "implications for cosmology will be analyzed in a separate paper  @xcite , where we will show in detail that chameleons are consistent with cosmological constraints on the existence of non - minimally coupled scalars , such as the bound on the time - variation of @xmath316 from nucleosynthesis , for example .",
    "moreover , we will describe how the field dynamically reaches the minimum of the effective potential , an element that was assumed _ a priori _ in the present work , and show how our scenario naturally provides a solution to the old moduli problem  @xcite .",
    "the striking difference in interaction range in the solar system versus on earth can lead to unexpected outcomes for experiments that test gravity in space .",
    "it was argued that the see project could measure an effective newton s constant drastically different than that on earth .",
    "meanwhile , the microscope , gg and step satellites could detect violations of the ep stronger than currently allowed by ground - based experiments .",
    "either outcome would effectively constitute a proof of the existence of chameleons .",
    "more importantly , these possible surprises for space experiments will hopefully strengthen the case for launching these satellites .    also , the door is open for conceiving of new table - top experiments to probe for the existence of chameleons , for instance by exploiting the fact that the properties of chameleons are sensitive to the surrounding matter density .",
    "for example , one could imagine doing atomic physics experiments inside or in the vicinity of a massive oscillating shell of matter .",
    "these oscillations would induce a time - dependence in the profile of the chameleon and thus in the frequency of emission lines  @xcite .",
    "it would also be interesting to investigate the behavior of the field at intermediate altitude , for instance at about 40 km where balloon experiments take place .",
    "this would require a more realistic modeling of the atmosphere than presented here .",
    "such an analysis could reveal that it may be possible to detect chameleons by performing gravity experiments in balloons  @xcite .",
