    "the _ aztec diamond of order @xmath0 _ is a planar region which can be completely tiled with _ dominos _",
    " two - by - one rectangles . over the past twenty years , this particular shape has come to occupy a central place in the literature of domino tilings of plane regions .",
    "tilings of large aztec diamonds exhibit striking features  the main one being that these tilings exhibit a limit shape , described by the so - called arctic circle theorem  @xcite .",
    "see figure  [ fig : pretty pictures of aztec diamonds ] for pictures of tilings of a relatively large aztec diamond .",
    "there are several alternate descriptions of a tiling of an aztec diamond .",
    "a domino tiling is equivalent to a perfect matching , or _",
    "dimer cover _",
    ", on the dual graph of the region which is tiled .",
    "there is an equivalent family of non - intersecting lattice paths , called dr paths  @xcite , and there is a description as a stack of a certain sort of blocks , called _ levitov blocks _ @xcite ( see  figure  [ fig : pretty pictures of aztec diamonds ] ) .",
    "there is also a well - studied _ interlacing particle process _ which is equivalent to the tiling model in a certain sense , but this equivalence is not bijective : there are @xmath1 tilings of the aztec diamond , whereas the number of configurations of the particle process are equinumerous with order-@xmath0 _ alternating sign matrices _ or configurations of the _ six - vertex model_. however , the correspondence is _ weight preserving _ and _ locally defined _ ; it maps certain collection of tilings to a configuration of the _ free - fermion _ six - vertex model  @xcite , preserving the relative weights .",
    "it is this point process whose local asymptotics have been studied most thoroughly  @xcite ; in particular , the boundary of the frozen region is more easily described using the particles , since it is related to the position of the last particles on different lines .",
    "there is also a relationship between these particles and a certain sort of _ zig - zag path _ in the tiling ( distinct from the zig - zag paths studied in  @xcite ) which is helpful .",
    "however , the many - to - one nature of the correspondence necessarily loses some of the information about the original tilings . in both the domino and particle pictures",
    ", we get determinantal point processes , although the precise combinatorial relation between the two processes is not immediate .",
    "we correct this situation in this paper , by giving a formula for the inverse kasteleyn matrix for the aztec diamond .",
    "this generalizes a previous result by helfgott  @xcite to the case when the horizontal and vertical dominos have different weights . using an observation of kenyon  @xcite , it is then possible to compute probabilities for various configurations of dominos and their asymptotic limits as the size of the aztec diamond increases . in particular",
    ", we find the behavior of the boundary of the frozen region when we can only see one type of domino .",
    "there are in fact four different types of dominos in a tiling : the dominos can be placed in two orientations , each of which comes in two different parities ( determined by the bipartition of the dual graph on which the dominos are placed ) . due to the arctic circle theorem , with probability one , there are only dominos of one of these four types clustered near each of the four corners of the aztec diamond . for this reason ( and others ,",
    "see  @xcite ) we call the four types of dominos _ north , south , east , and west _ , which are coloured red , green , yellow and blue in figure  [ fig : pretty pictures of aztec diamonds ] in the electronic version of this article .    for the moment , ignore all but the south dominos ( the green ones in figure  [ fig : pretty pictures of aztec diamonds ] ) . viewing each domino as a _ point _ , the set of all southern dominos form a determinantal point process .",
    "note that the positions of the southern dominos do not specify the tiling uniquely so they only give a partial description of the tiling ( though , together with any of the other types of dominos , they do ) .",
    "we analyze the distribution of the southern dominos along a diagonal line in a large aztec diamond , scaled so as to study the two intersections between this line and the frozen boundary of the tiling ( an `` arctic ellipse '' , in the weighted case ) .",
    "it would be possible to extend what we have done to analyze the joint distribution of all southern dominos in the aztec diamond ; as is , our analysis extends previous results in @xcite on placement probabilities of single dominos .",
    "we will show that the appropriate scaling limit of the point process of southern dominos along a diagonal line close to the boundary of the _ northern _ frozen region is given by a thinned airy kernel point process , where the amount of thinning depends on the relative weight of the horizontal and vertical dominos .",
    "this can be heuristically understood in the following way .",
    "the airy kernel point process , as mentioned earlier , is the edge limit of the particle process along a diagonal line , and these in turn are given by the intersections of the non - intersecting paths and the diagonal line .",
    "sometimes these intersections occur along a southern domino , and sometimes not .",
    "if we only see the southern dominos we only see some of these intersections and which of them we see is essentially random ; so we might expect , in the limit , a random thinning of the airy kernel point process .",
    "_ a priori _ it is not clear that the thinning becomes independent in the limit , but this turns out to be the case .",
    "if , instead , we examine the southern frozen region , we find that almost all of the dominos are coming from the south domino process , and thus lie in a frozen , brickwork pattern predominantly . the southern boundary is a `` hole '' in this regular pattern .",
    "consider the holes between the south dominos along a diagonal line in a neighborhood of the southern boundary .",
    "these holes also form a determinantal point process but in a scaling limit it does not converge to a _",
    "simple _ point process , but rather to a _ multiple point process _ with independent geometric probabilities for the multiple points in an airy kernel point process . this can be seen in figure  [ fig : pretty pictures of aztec diamonds ] : there is a tendency for dominos of like types to cluster together along the southern boundary .",
    "this tendency continues even in the limit , with a cluster of @xmath2 dominos becoming a point of multiplicity @xmath2 .",
    "the multiplicity increases as we go towards the lower tangency point of the arctic ellipse , a fact which can also be observed in figure  [ fig : pretty pictures of aztec diamonds ] .",
    "domino tilings on the aztec diamond were originally introduced in  @xcite as a model connected with the _ alternating sign matrices_. in this section , we give only a partial overview of the literature on the asymptotics of domino tilings of the aztec diamond    the limit shape for random tilings of the aztec diamond , the so - called arctic circle theorem , was first computed for @xmath3 in  @xcite .",
    "since then , there have been a variety of different and interesting approaches to compute the limit shape which hold for general @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the existence of limit shapes is not limited to domino tilings , limit shapes also exist for random lozenge tilings , for example the boxed plane partition  @xcite .",
    "these examples provided a motivation for a theory of the existence of limit shapes for general tiling models on bipartite graphs @xcite .",
    "the edge behavior , that is , the behavior between the frozen and unfrozen regions has , been of particular interest to the random matrix community , as the fluctuations are of size @xmath5 .",
    "this is the same size as the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue of the _ gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue)_. indeed , @xcite showed that the law of the particles associated to the tiling is given by the _",
    "airy process _ and that the position of the last particle is given by the tracy widom distribution , @xmath6 , see for example @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that the distribution of these particles becomes the _ gue minor process _ at the intersection of the liquid region and the boundary of the aztec diamond while @xcite obtained the similar results for a certain half aztec diamond .",
    "there are a handful of other explicitly inverted kasteleyn matrices in the literature for domino tilings .",
    "the inverse of the kasteleyn matrix of the aztec diamond was computed by helfgott  @xcite in the case of the uniform measure on domino tilings ; the results in  @xcite rely on explicit inverses of four kasteleyn - like matrices that , together , count perfect matchings on a torus - embedded graph . finally , kasteleyn  @xcite and independently temperley and fisher in  @xcite compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the kasteleyn matrix of the @xmath7 grid graph explicitly .",
    "a proof of convergence to the gaussian free field , following  @xcite should be possible .",
    "in fact , an earlier preprint of this paper ( dated dec 21 , 2012 and posted on the arxiv ) stated such a claim as theorem 2.9 , and outlined a proof , skipping over many details .",
    "we would like to retract this theorem and its outlined proof , for the following reason : the details that we omitted ( largely estimates on @xmath8 ) were numerous enough and technical enough that even a rather dedicated reader would have been hard - pressed to supply them all .",
    "moreover , in revision , we found it impossible to include enough details of these estimates while keeping the discussion brief .",
    "the proof , if and when it appears in the literature , will have to be in its own paper .",
    "instead , we include in section 6 only a list of the estimates that would be needed in order to demonstrate convergence .",
