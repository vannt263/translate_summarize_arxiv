    "the primary objective of the nasa _ kepler mission _ is to detect , by the transit method , earth - sized planets in the habitable zones of solar - type main - sequence stars ( borucki et al . 2010 ; koch et al . 2010 ) .",
    "photometry of most of the stars is conducted at a long cadence ( lc ) of 29.4minutes , but a subset of up to 512 stars can be observed at a short cadence ( sc ) of 58.85s .",
    "the exquisite precision and accuracy of the _ kepler _ data mean they are also well suited to asteroseismic studies of stars ( e.g. , see gilliland et al .",
    "2010a , jenkins et al .",
    "the cadence of the sc data is rapid enough to allow investigations of solar - like oscillations in solar - type stars , where dominant periods are of the order of several minutes ( chaplin et al .",
    "2010 , 2011a ; metcalfe et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "asteroseismology has an important role to play in the exoplanet program , in that the precise and accurate inferences on the stellar properties ",
    "i.e. , radius , mass and age  that are made possible by the seismic data allow very tight constraints to be placed on the exoplanetary systems , e.g. , tight estimation of the stellar radius constrains the size of the planet ( kjeldsen et al .",
    "2009 ; stello et al . 2009a",
    "; christensen - dalsgaard et al . 2010 ) .",
    "solar - type stars flagged as potential planet hosts are therefore prime candidates for asteroseismic study .",
    "the lc lightcurves of solar - type stars that are flagged by the transiting planet search pipeline as having significant transit - like features are modeled , and those stars having companion radii less than two jupiter radii are labeled as a kepler object of interest ( koi ) ( batalha et al .",
    "one of the factors that then determines whether or not to assign the star to one of limited number of sc slots  allowing more rapid time - cadence observations  is whether the intrinsic properties and the apparent magnitude of the star would allow the detection of solar - like oscillations .",
    "this paper describes the straightforward procedure that has been implemented to answer this question .",
    "we use simple scaling relations to predict the oscillations and granulation properties of any given koi .",
    "the predictions use as input basic information available on each star from the _ kepler input catalog _ ( or kic ; see , e.g. , batalha et al .",
    "together with the known apparent magnitude of a given target , the scaling relation predictions are used to construct an appropriate measure of the signal - to - noise ratio in the frequency - power spectrum of the solar - like oscillations , and , from that , we use some straightforward statistics to estimate the probability of detection for the star .    to calibrate and verify the recipe we use asteroseismic results on solar - type stars that were observed by _",
    "kepler _ during the first seven months of science operations .",
    "about 2000 stars , down to kepler apparent magnitude @xmath0 , were selected as potential solar - type targets based upon their kic parameters . each was observed for one month at a time in sc .",
    "timeseries were prepared for asteroseismic analysis in the manner described by garca et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and different teams applied their codes to attempt to detect , and then extract the basic properties of , the solar - like oscillations .",
    "several modeling teams also then applied codes to estimate the stellar properties  using the basic oscillations parameters as inputs  which we then also made use of in validation of the recipe .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "we introduce in section  [ sec : oscill ] the basic principles underlying the detection test .",
    "we then detail the scaling relation predictions that are required for the test : section  [ sec : scaling ] gives the scaling relations for the solar - like oscillations , while section  [ sec : bgtot ] gives scaling relations for the granulation and shot - noise contributions to the background power spectral density .",
    "the various ingredients are brought together in section  [ sec : det ] , in which the test is described in detail .",
    "the predictions of the test are compared in section  [ sec : res ] to real results returned on the solar - type ensemble that was observed for asteroseismology .",
    "we conclude by presenting some general predictions for detectability of _ kepler _ kois .",
    "the frequency power spectra of solar - like oscillations in solar - type stars present a pattern of peaks with near regular frequency separations .",
    "the mode powers are modulated by an envelope .",
    "the envelope has a bell - shaped appearance in many stars for which solar - like oscillations have been observed ( including the sun ) .",
    "different techniques have been devised and applied to the _ kepler _ sc data to detect signatures of solar - like oscillations ( e.g. , see chaplin et al .",
    "2010 ; campante et al .",
    "2010 ; hekker et al . 2010 ; huber et al . 2009 ; karoff et al . 2010 ; mosser & appourchaux 2009 ; mathur et al . 2010",
    "; roxburgh 2009 ) .",
    "some techniques rely on extracting signatures of the near - regular frequency separations of the oscillations ; others search for signatures of the gaussian - like power excess due to the oscillations .    here ,",
    "we devise and apply a simple statistical detection test that is based upon the second family of techniques .",
    "our choice is predicated on the requirement that the test should be straightforward to implement on a large number of stars .",
    "making an absolute prediction of the detectability of the frequency separations is more complicated than the test we adopt . strictly speaking",
    ", it demands that the damping rates of the solar - like oscillations , and the rotation and angle of inclination of the star , are known .",
    "we therefore opt for a simpler approach , which does not require assumptions to be made about these properties .",
    "we do so in the knowledge that once the oscillations power excess has been detected , the large frequency separation in solar - type stars will also be readily extractable .",
    "the detection test is based upon the total observed power due to p - mode oscillations in the star .",
    "let @xmath1 be the total expected underlying mean power .",
    "as we shall show below , this is very easily estimated from scaling relations . in the frequency - power spectrum ,",
    "the approximately gaussian - shaped power envelope due to the oscillations sits on top of slowly varying background power , which we assume is dominated by contributions from shot / instrumental noise and stellar granulation . when the observed power in the oscillations relative to the background is high ( i.e. , high snr ) ,",
    "the power excess due to the oscillations will be clearly visible .",
    "however , at low snr , statistical fluctuations in the background power may swamp the oscillations signal , so that the excess is much harder to see .",
    "if @xmath2 measures the total underlying background power across the range in frequency occupied by the oscillations , then a `` global '' measure of snr in the oscillations spectrum is given by @xmath3 provided @xmath4 is high enough , we may be able to claim an unambiguous detection of the power excess due to the oscillations . if @xmath5 independent frequency bins have contributed to the estimation of the snr , we may then test it against @xmath6 @xmath7-d.o.f . statistics to determine if the snr is sufficiently high that it would be hard to explain by chance alone .",
    "this is a false - alarm approach .",
    "let us suppose that we demand that a false alarm test be passed at , say , the 1% level to merit a likely detection .",
    "we first estimate a false - alarm threshold , @xmath8 , i.e. , the snr value above which there is less than a 1 in 100 chance of a @xmath6 @xmath7-d.o.f .",
    "distribution giving a normalized value greater than or equal to this purely at random .",
    "we then use the scaling relations to estimate the expected underlying @xmath4 of the target , and , with that number in hand , we may then estimate the probability that an observed value of the snr for the star would be greater than , or equal to , @xmath8 , i.e. , that it would pass the false - alarm test is greater than , or equal to , @xmath8 one might naively expect that the chances of passing the false - alarm test would be 100% .",
    "however , one must remember that the real observations will be modified by the @xmath6 @xmath7-d.o.f .",
    "statistics , which will mean that not every case would pass . ] .",
    "this final probability serves as an estimate of the detection probability of the star .",
    "the frequency at the peak of the power envelope of the oscillations , where the observed modes present their strongest amplitudes , is commonly referred to as @xmath9 . our ability to predict @xmath9 from the fundamental stellar properties",
    "allows us to estimate where in frequency the oscillations would be most prominent .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 scales with the acoustic cut - off frequency ( brown et al .",
    "1991 ; kjeldsen & bedding 1995 ) determined for an isothermal stellar atmosphere ( as verified observationally by mosser et al .",
    "this scaling has been shown to provide good predictions for observed solar - like oscillation spectra .",
    "this gives , in terms of the fundamental stellar properties , the following scaling relation : @xmath11 where we have scaled against the solar values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the most striking characteristic frequency separations in the oscillation spectra are the so - called large frequency separations , @xmath10 .",
    "these are the separations between consecutive overtones , @xmath14 , having the same spherical angular degree , @xmath15 . the average value of the large frequency separation scales very well with the square root of the mean density of the star ( e.g. , see christensen - dalsgaard 1993 ) .",
    "here , we use this scaling and calibrate estimated values against the observed average large separation of the sun , i.e. , @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "it has also recently been shown ( stello et al .",
    "2009b ) that solar - like oscillations in main - sequence stars follow to good approximation the following relation : @xmath18 use of equation  [ eq : dnunumax ] allows us to eliminate @xmath19 from equations  [ eq : numax ] and  [ eq : dnu ] , to yield scaling relations that depend only on @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the process of elimination yields the scaling relation @xmath22 , which is close to the relation @xmath23 in noyes et al .",
    "the scaling relations for @xmath10 and @xmath9 in @xmath21 and @xmath20 are : @xmath24 @xmath25      in order to comment on mode detectability , we must be able to predict the mode amplitudes .",
    "we base our predictions on kjeldsen & bedding ( 1995 ) and samadi et al .",
    "we make predictions for observations made in intensity ( relevant to _ kepler _ photometry ) .",
    "the prediction is that the maximum oscillation intensity amplitudes @xmath26 of the radial ( @xmath27 ) modes scale like @xmath28 with the coefficient @xmath29 often quoted between 0.7 and 1.0 .",
    "we follow kjeldsen & bedding ( 1995 ) , and assume that the temperature dependence is quadratic .",
    "we have also included another coefficient , @xmath30 , because without any further correction the above relation is known to overestimate the amplitudes in the hottest solar - type stars ( e.g. , see houdek 2006 , and references therein ) . to estimate the solar rms value @xmath31 we used the _ kepler _ response function in wavelength , and known measurements of the solar amplitudes made in narrow - band observations by the three wavelength channels of the virgo / spm instrument onboard soho ( see ballot , in preparation ) . from the spm data we defined the observed solar amplitude as a function of wavelength , and then weighted this curve by the _",
    "kepler _ response function to give an estimated rms value of @xmath32 .",
    "we have used results of _ kepler _ observations of solar - type stars to calibrate the size of the correction @xmath30 . results on @xmath10 and @xmath9 were used by modeling teams , together with @xmath20 , to provide estimates of the stellar radii and masses ( e.g. , see stello et al . 2009a ; basu et al .",
    "2010 ; quirion et al .",
    "2010 ; gai et al .",
    "these estimated stellar properties were used to calculate predicted maximum amplitudes using equation  [ eq : amp ] , with the unknown ( at this stage ) @xmath30 set to unity .",
    "we then calculated the ratios of the observed amplitudes , @xmath26 ( extracted by the octave pipeline ) , to the predicted amplitudes , @xmath33 , for different assumed values of @xmath29 .",
    "we now go on to discuss the results obtained for @xmath34 .",
    "the ratios for @xmath34 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] against @xmath20 ( left - hand panels ) and @xmath35 ( right - hand panels ) .",
    "we define @xmath36 to be the temperature on the red edge of the radial - mode @xmath37-scuti instability strip , given in houdek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , at the luminosity , @xmath38 , of a given star : @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] show a decrease in the ratio of the observed to predicted amplitudes as @xmath20 increases .",
    "a more clearly defined trend is present in the @xmath35 plot , and we therefore chose to use fits performed on these data to fix the correction @xmath30 .",
    "we fitted the following functions : first @xmath41 and then the less restrictive @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 were the free parameters to be optimized , and weights for the fits were fixed by the uncertainties on the amplitude ratios .",
    "the correction seeks to allow for the attenuation of the amplitudes at high @xmath20 ( which maps to low @xmath35 ) , and since at progressively lower @xmath46 one expects the amplitude predictions to be much more robust , we require a function that turns over at high @xmath35 ( hence the choice of an exponential ) . the solid blue and dashed red lines in the right - hand panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : beta ] show the best - fitting equations  [ eq : beta2 ] and  [ eq : beta1 ] , respectively .",
    "the best - fitting @xmath6 for the two models were almost indistinguishable ( about 2.3 ) , and as such we chose to adopt the simpler equation  [ eq : beta2 ] as our model for @xmath30 , with its best - fitting @xmath47 .",
    "a fit to a simple straight - line model gave a marginally better @xmath6 than either of the two exponential models .",
    "the straight - line model does of course fail to capture the requirement that the amplitude ratio curve turn over at higher @xmath35 , and its use would lead to the prediction of unphysically high amplitudes in the coolest solar - type stars .",
    "we also performed the above analyses assuming the predicted amplitudes scaled like @xmath48 ( i.e. , with @xmath49 in equation  [ eq : amp ] ) .",
    "however , we found that we had to increase arbitrarily our assumed value of @xmath31  from 2.5 to 3.1ppm  otherwise most of the amplitude ratios lay significantly above unity .",
    "we therefore opted to fix @xmath34 ( as per the results outlined above ) .    to summarize",
    ", we have , using the scaling relations in @xmath21 and @xmath46 , and taking @xmath34 , @xmath50 with @xmath30 calibrated by equation  [ eq : beta2 ] using @xmath51 .",
    "we assume that there are two dominant contributions to the background power spectral density in the vicinity of @xmath9 in the frequency - power spectrum .",
    "the largest contribution comes from instrumental / shot noise , which we define in terms of a simple offset @xmath52 .",
    "when observations of the oscillations are made in intensity , stellar granulation also contributes significant power which must be accounted for in estimation of the total background .",
    "we model the granulation power as a lorentzian function centred on zero frequency ( e.g. , harvey 1985 ) , with a characteristic power spectral density , @xmath53 , and a characteristic timescale , @xmath54 .",
    "the power spectral density @xmath55 at frequency @xmath9 is then given by : @xmath56 we now go on to describe scaling relations for each of the free parameters needed to model the total background , beginning with those describing the granulation term .",
    "we follow huber et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in assuming that @xmath57 scales inversely with @xmath58 , as proposed by kjeldsen & bedding ( in preparation ) .",
    "this means that the denominator of equation  [ eq : harvey ] will be constant for all stars . taking solar values of @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ", we have that : @xmath61 to describe @xmath53 , we assume that the typical size of a convective granule is proportional to the scale height for an isothermal atmosphere , and that all granules behave in a statistically independent manner so that the total rms fluctuation scales inversely as the square root of the number of observed granules .",
    "this leads to ( e.g. , schwarzschild 1975 ; kjeldsen & bedding , in preparation ; see also baudin et al .",
    "2006 ) : @xmath62 with @xmath22 ( see section  [ sec : nus ] ) , the above implies that @xmath63 @xmath64    we have tested equation  [ eq : pg1 ] using results from the _ kepler _ survey on solar - type stars .",

    "[ fig : off ] plots the best - fitting @xmath55 of solar - type stars with detected oscillations ( given by a fit of a harvey - like model , plus a flat offset , to the background power spectral density ) .",
    "the best - fitting power law is found to be @xmath65 , which is close to the prediction above . using appropriate normalization from the real data ,",
    "we therefore adopt : @xmath66 the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : off ] shows the prediction from equation  [ eq : bmax ] .",

    "the solid line shows the prediction from equation  [ eq : noise ] .",
    "we see acceptable agreement between the observations and the predictions .",
    "first , we must compute the expected underlying global snr of the target of interest , @xmath4 .    as noted previously",
    ", we assume that the power in the oscillations is modulated by a gaussian - shaped envelope in frequency .",
    "we wish to calculate the total expected power underneath the envelope .",
    "the fwhm of the power envelope is assumed to be equal to @xmath72 ( e.g. , see stello et al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ; also mosser et al . 2010 ) , implying that most of the total mode power is contained within a range @xmath73 around @xmath9 .",
    "each segment @xmath10 of the spectrum will contain power due to the visible @xmath27 , 1 , 2 and 3 modes ( although note that the relative contribution from the @xmath74 modes is extremely weak ) .",
    "the @xmath27 mode at the centre of the gaussian - shaped envelope will have a power approximately equal to @xmath75 .",
    "the neighbouring @xmath76 , 2 and 3 modes in the central @xmath10 will contribute a further @xmath77 of power ( e.g. , see ballot , in preparation ; kjeldsen et al .",
    "this relative contribution is fixed by the relative visibilities of the different @xmath15 .",
    "the total oscillations power in the central segment is therefore equal to @xmath78 .    to obtain the total mean power , @xmath1 , underneath the gaussian - shaped envelope we must then add the contributions from all other segments of @xmath10 that fall in the range @xmath79 around @xmath9 . in all",
    ", @xmath80 segments will contribute , with the average power of the contributing segments being @xmath81 times that of the central segment ( the factor of 0.5 following from the fall - off in frequency of the gaussian function ) .",
    "this implies that : @xmath82 we must also make a correction for the fact that the high fractional duty cycle of the _ kepler _ integrations , coupled with a cadence of nearly one minute , leads to apodization of the oscillations signal the closer @xmath9 is to the nyquist frequency ( @xmath83 ) of the sc sampling .",
    "the amplitudes are suppressed by the factor @xmath84,\\ ] ] so that equation  [ eq : ptot ] should actually be written as @xmath85 fig .",
    "[ fig : ptot ] offers confirmation that equation  [ eq : ptot1a ] does indeed provide a reasonably good description of @xmath1 , thereby implying that the gaussian - envelope description provides a good model for the total observed oscillations power .",
    "it shows @xmath86 , as constructed with equation  [ eq : ptot1a ] from the observed @xmath26 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 of stars showing detected oscillations , against their actual measured @xmath1 , as given by the sum of the power excess above the fitted background in each frequency - power spectrum .",
    "the red line shows the one - to - one relation , which the data are seen to follow to good approximation .",
    "we take one additional step for the detection recipe , and use equations  [ eq : numax1 ] ,  [ eq : dnu1 ] and  [ eq : amp1 ] to re - express @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath26 in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath20 , to give the following relation : @xmath87    turning next to the background , the total underlying background power in the frequency - power spectrum across the range @xmath9 is given approximately by : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the background power spectral density at the frequency @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath90 for simplicity , we have ignored the frequency dependence of the background , assuming instead that the value @xmath89 captures the average value of the background to sufficient accuracy .",
    "we may then calculate the global snr in the total oscillations power as @xmath91 ( equation  [ eq : snr ] ) .",
    "a total of @xmath5 independent frequency bins will contribute to estimation of the underlying @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and hence @xmath92 .",

    "as @xmath93 , and hence @xmath5 , increases , so the relative statistical fluctuations in @xmath2 will decrease in magnitude ; hence , for a given underlying @xmath108 , the excess power due to the oscillations will be more clearly visible against the background ( as reflected in a reduction in the size of @xmath8 ) .",
    "we now apply our detection test to the solar - type stars observed for one month each by _ kepler _ during the first seven months of science operations .",
