    "the recent observations of the charged particle elliptic flow and jet quenching in ultrarelativistic au - au and pb - pb collisions performed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite at brookhaven national laboratory and large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite at cern have been the key experimental discoveries in the creation and study of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the analysis of the data obtained from the hot and dense system produced in these experiments revealed that the strongly interacting matter formed in these collisions is a nearly perfect fluid with extremely low viscosity . in the verification of the condition for applying hydrodynamics to nuclear system , it turned out that the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle requires a finite viscosity for any thermal fluid . in this respect ,",
    "one of the most fascinating theoretical findings has been the conjecture by kovtun , son and starinets ( kss )  @xcite that the ratio @xmath1 of shear viscosity @xmath0 to the entropy volume density @xmath2 is bounded below for all fluids , namely the value @xmath6 is the universal lower bound ( the so - called kss bound or kss unit ) .",
    "although several theoretical counter examples have been proposed , no fluid that violates this lower bound has ever been experimentally found so far  @xcite .",
    "the qgp fluid produced at rhic has @xmath7 ( 2 - 3 ) kss units .",
    "given this conjectured universality , there has been an increasing interest in calculating the ratio @xmath1 in different systems .",
    "the first theoretical study that calculated the ratio @xmath1 for finite nuclei has been the recent article by auerbach and shlomo , who estimated @xmath8 ( 4 - 19 ) and ( 2.5 - 12.5 ) kss units for heavy and light nuclei , respectively  @xcite .",
    "these results have been obtained within the framework of the fermi liquid drop model ( fldm )  @xcite , which was applied to the damping of giant collective vibrations .",
    "the calculated shear viscosity @xmath0 in this study increases with temperature @xmath3 up to quite high value of @xmath9 10 mev to reach a maximum at @xmath9 12 - 13 mev . at higher @xmath3 a decrease of @xmath0",
    "is seen . as a result , within the region 0 @xmath10 5 mev , where giant resonances exists ,",
    "the damping width predicted by the fldm always increases with @xmath3 , being roughly proportional to @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "such temperature dependence contradicts the experimental systematics of the width of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) in hot nuclei . as a matter of fact",
    ", a large number of experiments on heavy - ion fusion and inelastic scattering of light projectiles on heavy targets has shown that , while the location of the gdr peak ( the gdr energy ) is rather insensitive to the variation of @xmath3 , its full width at the half maximum ( fwhm ) increases with @xmath3 only within 1 @xmath10 2.5 mev .",
    "below @xmath9 1 mev , it remains nearly constant , whereas at @xmath11 3 - 4 mev the width seems to saturate  @xcite . to calculate the ratio @xmath1 , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite employed the fermi gas formula for the entropy @xmath12 with a temperature - independent level density parameter @xmath13 .",
    "this approximation too is rather poor for finite nuclei , as has been pointed out by one of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , who has proposed a fitting formula for the temperature - dependent density parameter @xmath14  @xcite . therefore , although the ratio @xmath1 , which was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by dividing two increasing with @xmath3 quantities , does decrease qualitatively to reach a values within one order of the kss bound as @xmath3 increases up to 2 - 3 mev , it is highly desirable to obtain a refined quantitative estimation for this ratio in finite hot nuclei from both theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "the aim of the present work is to calculate the ratio @xmath1 directly from the most recent and accurate experimental systematics of the gdr widths in hot nuclei .",
    "the extracted empirical values are then confronted with theoretical predictions by four models , which have been developed to describe the temperature dependence of the gdr width , namely the phonon damping model ( pdm )  @xcite , two thermal shape fluctuation models ( tsfm )  @xcite , as well as the fldm mentioned above . an attempt to pinpoint the high - temperature limit of the ratio @xmath1 in finite nuclei in the most model - independent way is also undertaken .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "the formalism of calculating the shear viscosity @xmath0 from the gdr width and energy is discussed in sec .",
    "[ visco ] . the theoretical assessment for the entropy density",
    "is given in sec .",
    "[ entro ] .",
    "the analysis of numerical results is presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "the article is summarized in the last section , where conclusions are drawn .",
    "the increase of widths of nuclear giant resonances with decreasing the mass number suggests that the damping mechanism of collective vibrations might qualitatively be similar to that of a viscous fluid , where damping of sound waves under the influence of viscosity increases as the system volume decreases  @xcite . from the viewpoint of collective theories ,",
    "one of the fundamental explanations for the giant resonance damping remains the friction term ( i.e. viscosity ) of the neutron and proton fluids  @xcite . a quantitative description of the dissipative behavior requires an inter - particle collision term to be included into the equation of motion for the one - body density matrix .",
    "for example , the nuclear fluid - dynamics approach incorporated a collision term in the landau - vlasov equation to derive the momentum conservation , which includes three terms similar to the stress tensor , shear modulus , and dissipative component of the momentum flux tensor , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the latter resembles the viscous term in the macroscopic navier - stokes equation , and is proportional to the damping coefficient of collective motion in the regime of rare collisions ( zero - sound regime ) .",
    "viscosity has also been employed to describe the decay of collective excitations in the context of nuclear fission in the 1970s  @xcite .    in the microscopic description ,",
    "the ( quantal ) width @xmath15 of giant resonances at @xmath5 0 ( @xmath16 4 - 5 mev in medium and heavy nuclei ) consists of the landau width @xmath17 , spreading width @xmath18 , and escape width @xmath19 .",
    "the landau width @xmath17 is essentially the variance @xmath20 of the distribution of particle - hole ( @xmath21 ) states forming the giant resonance . the spreading width @xmath18 is caused by coupling of @xmath22 states to more complicate configurations , first of all , the @xmath23 ones , whereas the escape width @xmath19 arises because of coupling to the continuum causing the direct particle decay into hole states of the residual nucleus . in medium and heavy nuclei ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath19 account only for a small fraction of the total width @xmath15 .",
    "the major contribution is given by @xmath18 . in light nuclei",
    ", @xmath19 gives a dominant contribution , whereas @xmath17 is also mainly apparent . within the semiclassical approaches such as the landau - vlasov kinetic theory  @xcite or phenomenological approaches to nuclear friction  @xcite",
    ", @xmath17 corresponds to the collisionless damping or one - body dissipation ( long - mean free path ) , whereas @xmath18 comes from the collision damping or two - body dissipation ( short - mean free path ) . in the hydrodynamic theory of collective motion , which is based on",
    "a short - mean free path , the dissipative effects are usually bulk phenomena caused by the viscous shearing stresses between adjacent layers of fluid .",
    "the microscopic mechanism of this energy dissipation resides in the coupling of @xmath22 configurations to @xmath23 ones , which causes the spreading width @xmath18 of giant resonances .",
    "this is how the shear viscosity is related to the damping of collective motion due to two - body interaction between nucleons in nuclei or molecules of a fluid .",
    "the one - body dissipation ( long - mean free path ) has been introduced based on the argument that the nucleon mean - free path is long compared to the nuclear radius .",
    "it arises primarily from the collisions of nucleons with the moving nuclear surface rather than with each other ( the wall formula )  @xcite .",
    "although neither the wall formula nor the ordinary two - body viscosity can describe correctly the experimental widths of giant resonances , the predictions by the two - body viscosity ( short - mean free path ) are much closer to the experimental data  @xcite . as for the fission - fragment kinetic energies ,",
    "the results obtained on the basis of one - body dissipation agree with the experimental values equally well as those predicted by two - body viscosity  @xcite .",
    "the evidence shows that a comprehensive view of the damping of giant resonances is likely a sum of one- and two - body contributions .",
    "this is consistent with the microscopic picture , where the one - body dissipation is described within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , whereas the two - body dissipation is taken into account by coupling of the @xmath22 states obtained within the rpa to @xmath23 configurations or collective phonon beyond the rpa .",
    "the discussion above indicates an uncertainty in extracting the value @xmath24 of the shear viscosity @xmath25 at @xmath5 0 , given different dissipation mechanisms . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two - body viscosity was employed under the assumption of a rigid nuclear boundary to fit the data of isovector and isoscalar giant resonances at @xmath5 0 .",
    "a value @xmath26 1@xmath27 @xmath28 0.016 tp ( terapoise ) has been found , where @xmath29 mev s @xmath30 .",
    "the analysis of nuclear fission data based on the two - body collisions  @xcite gives @xmath24 in the range of ( 0.6 - 1.2)@xmath27 , or ( 0.01 - 0.02 ) tp , under the assumption that scission occurs at zero radius of the neck rupture .",
    "a later study  @xcite assumed a finite radius for the neck rupture and found larger @xmath31 ( 1.1 - 2.5)@xmath27 , or ( 0.02 - 0.04 ) tp .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite adopted @xmath26 ( 1.9 @xmath32 0.6)@xmath27 , or 0.03 @xmath32 0.01 tp , to calculate the widths of giant resonances for nuclei with deformable surfaces under the assumption of incompressible , irrotational , small - amplitude nuclear flow .",
    "the predicted theoretical widths are 3 times larger than the experimental values within the one - body disspation mechanism based on the wall formula . for a modified one - body disspation ,",
    "the calculated widths are smaller than the experimental ones . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same authors calculated the fission - fragments kinetic energies using two - body viscosity in a similar way as that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with a modified potential .",
    "they found that the value @xmath33 0.936@xmath27 ( 0.015 tp ) satisfactorily reproduces the experimental data .",
    "this value is very close to that obtained in ref .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that anomaly large values of @xmath24 , in the range of ( 2 - 25)@xmath27 , must be used in order to obtain a simultaneous description of the variances of mass distributions and multiplicities of prescission particles on the basis of both one- and two - body dissipations .",
    "the strong disagreement between the largest value @xmath33 25@xmath27 obtained in this case and thoses given in other references mentioned above shed doubt on the posibility of consistently describing the mass - energy distribution and prescission - particle multiplicity .    in the present article , the value @xmath33 1@xmath27 , extracted in ref .",
    "@xcite , is adopted as a parameter in combination with the lower and upper bounds , equal to 0.6@xmath27 and 1.2@xmath27 , respectively , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied here as error bars .",
    "the justification of this choice is based on two reasons .",
    "the first one is that the present article considers the evolution of @xmath25 as a function of @xmath3 based on the gdr in hot heavy ( spherical or weaky deformed ) nuclei . at @xmath5 0",
    "it should naturally be equal to @xmath24 extracted from fitting the ground - state gdr ( i.e. @xmath5 0 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . moreover , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , compact nuclei favor the two - body viscosity , whereas the onset of one - body dissipation is seen only in fissioning nuclei when the necking in starts , leading to a strong increase of the friction coefficient .",
    "this is also in line with the previously mentioned small constribution of @xmath17 and @xmath19 in heavy nuclei .",
    "the second reason is that the present article attempts to see how low the ratio @xmath1 can go with increasing @xmath3 , or how the kss limit is fulfilled in hot nuclei .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath24 found in the above - mentioned estimations is @xmath33 0.6@xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the same lower bound has also been adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate @xmath25 within the fldm , where the upper bound varies within the range of ( 1.9 @xmath32 0.6)@xmath27 , i.e. the same as used in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as has been mentioned above , these large upper bounds fail to reproduce the giant resonance width .      with these cautions regarding the selected values @xmath24 , one now proceeds to study the evolution of @xmath25 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the energy dissipation , which is a characteristic of a non - equilibrium or local thermodynamic equilibrium state ( such as electrical conductivity , heat diffusion , shear viscosity ,  ) is related to fluctuations in statistical equilibrium or global thermodynamics equilibrium ( such as thermal noise of electric and heat currents , collective vibrations ,  ) by means of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt )  @xcite .",
    "this is realized making use of the green - kubo formula  @xcite , which is an exact expression for the linear transport coefficient of any system at a given temperature @xmath3 and density @xmath34 in terms of the time dependence of equilibrium fluctuations in the conjugate flux .",

    "the calculations adopt the value @xmath285 ( @xmath29 mev s @xmath30 ) as a parameter , which has been extracted by fitting the giant resonances at @xmath5 0  @xcite and fission data  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of numerical calculations show that the shear viscosity @xmath0 increases between ( 0.5 - 2.5)@xmath27 with increasing @xmath3 from 0.5 up to @xmath248 3 - 3.5 mev for @xmath33 1@xmath27 . at higher @xmath3 the pdm ,",
    "am , and ptsfm predict a saturation , or at least a very slow increase of @xmath0 , whereas the fldm show a continuously strong increase of @xmath0 , with @xmath3 . at @xmath5 5 mev ,",
    "the pdm estimates @xmath0 between around ( 1.3 - 3.5)@xmath27 .",
    "all theoretical models predict a decrease of the ratio @xmath1 with increasing @xmath3 up to @xmath248 2.5 mev . at higher @xmath3 , the pdm , am , and",
    "ptsfm show a continuous decrease of @xmath1 , whereas the fldm predicts an increase of @xmath1 , with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "the pdm fits best the empirical values for @xmath1 extracted at 0.7@xmath10 3.2 mev for all three nuclei , @xmath240cu @xmath113sn , and @xmath157pb . at @xmath5 5",
    "mev , the values of @xmath1 predicted by the pdm reach @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xmath288 kss units for @xmath240cu , @xmath113sn , and @xmath157pb , respectively . combining these results with the model - independent estimation for the high-@xmath3 limit of @xmath1 , which is @xmath289 kss units",
    ", one can conclude that the value of @xmath1 for medium and heavy nuclei at @xmath5 5 mev is in between ( 1.3 - 4.0 ) kss units , which is about ( 3 - 5 ) times smaller ( and of much less uncertainty ) that the value between ( 4 - 19 ) kss units predicted by the fldm for heavy nuclei , where the same lower value @xmath33 0.6@xmath27 was used . by using the same upper value @xmath33 2.5@xmath27 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , instead of @xmath33 1.2@xmath27 , this interval for @xmath1 becomes ( 1.3 - 8.3 ) kss units , whose uncertainty of 7 kss units is still smaller than that predicted by the fldm ( 15 kss units ) .",
    "this estimation also indicates that nucleons inside a hot nucleus at @xmath5 5 mev has nearly the same ratio @xmath1 as that of qgp , around ( 2 - 3 ) kss units , at @xmath11 170 mev discovered at rhic and lhc .",
