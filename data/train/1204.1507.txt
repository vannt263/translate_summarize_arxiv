    "consider a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold for a flow or a map , and assume that the stable and unstable manifolds of the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold have a transverse intersection along a homoclinic manifold .",
    "one can distinguish an inner dynamics , associated to the restriction of the flow or of the map to the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold , and an outer dynamics , associated to the homoclinic orbits .",
    "there exist pseudo - orbits obtained by alternately following the inner dynamics and the outer dynamics for some finite periods of time .",
    "an important question on the dynamics is whether there exist true orbits with similar behavior . in this paper",
    ", we develop a toolkit of instruments and techniques to detect true orbits near a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold , that alternatively follow the inner dynamics and the outer dynamics , for all time .",
    "some of the tools discussed below have already been used in other works .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a general recipe on how to make a systematic use of these tools in general situations .",
    "the first tool is the scattering map , which is defined on the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold , and assigns to the foot of an unstable fiber passing through a point in the homoclinic manifold , the foot of the corresponding stable fiber that passes through the same point in the homoclinic manifold .",
    "this tool , sometimes referred as the homoclinic map , has been used in @xcite , and subsequently refined and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the scattering map can be defined both in the flow case and in the map case . in section [ sec : nhim ] we recall some background on normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds and lambda lemma . in section [ sec : scatteringmap ] we describe the relationship between the scattering map for a flow and the scattering map for the return map to a surface of section .",
    "we note that the scattering map is defined in terms of the geometric structure , however it is not dynamically defined  there is no actual orbit that is given by the scattering map .    the second tool that we discuss is the transition map , that actually follows the homoclinic orbits for a prescribed time .",
    "the transition map can be computed in terms of the scattering map .",
    "again , we will have a transition map for the flow and one for the return map , and we will describe the relationships between them . the transition map is presented in section [ sec : transition ] .    the third tool is the topological method of correctly aligned windows ( see @xcite ) , which is used to detect orbits with prescribed itineraries in a dynamical system .",
    "a window is a homeomorphic copy of a multi - dimensional rectangle , with a choice of an exit direction and of an entry direction .",
    "a window is correctly aligned with another window if the image of the first window crosses the second window all the way through and across its exit set .",
    "this method is reviewed briefly in section [ section : topological ] .",
    "the fourth tool is a shadowing lemma type of result for a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold , presented in section [ sec : shadowing ] .",
    "the assumption is that a bi - infinite sequence of windows lying in the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold is given , with the consecutive pairs of windows being correctly aligned , alternately , under the transition map ( outer map ) , and under some power of the inner map .",
    "the role of the windows is to approximate the location of orbits .",
    "then there exists a true orbit that follows closely these windows , in the prescribed order . to apply this lemma for a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold for a map",
    ", one needs to reduce the dynamics from the continuous case to the discrete case by considering the return map to a surface of section , and construct the sequence of correctly aligned windows for the return map .",
    "for this situation , the relationships between the scattering map for the flow and the scattering map for the return map , and between the transition map for the flow and the transition map for the return map , explored in section [ sec : scatteringmap ] and section [ sec : transition ] , are useful .",
    "a remarkable feature of these tools is that they can be used for both analytic arguments and rigorous numerical verifications .",
    "the scattering map and the transition map can be computed explicitly in concrete systems .",
    "the main advantage is that they can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the problem : from the phase space of a flow to a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold for the flow , and further to the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold for the return map to a surface of section .",
    "the shadowing lemma also plays a key role in reducing the dimensionality of the problem : it requires the verification of topological conditions in the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold for the return map to conclude the existence of trajectories in the phase space of the flow . in numerical applications , reducing the number of dimensions of the objects computed is very crucial .",
    "the potency of these tools in numerical application is illustrated in @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for developing these tools resides with the instability problem for hamiltonian systems . in the appendix",
    "we describe two models where the above techniques can be applied to show the existence of unstable orbits .",
    "the first model is the large gap problem for nearly integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "the second model is the spatial circular restricted three - body problem .    in conclusion , we provide a practical recipe for finding trajectories with prescribed itineraries for a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold with the property that its stable and unstable manifolds have a transverse intersection along a homoclinic manifold :    * compute the scattering map associated to the homoclinic manifold .",
    "* for some prescribed forward and backwards integration times , compute the corresponding transition map .",
    "* if necessary , reduce the dynamics from a flow to the return map via some surface of section . determine the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold relative to the surface of section , and compute the inner map  the restriction of the return map relative to the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold .",
    "* compute the scattering map and the transition map for the return map . * construct windows within the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold relative to the surface of section , with the the property that the consecutive pairs of windows are correctly aligned , alternately , under the transition map and under some power of the inner map . *",
    "apply the shadowing lemma stated in theorem [ lem : shadowing1 ] to conclude that there exist orbits that follow closely these windows .",
