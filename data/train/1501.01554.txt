    "<S> the temperature - dependent resistivity is metallic . </S>",
    "<S> deviation from a linear temperature - dependence is evident below 100 k and a @xmath4-dependence is roughly followed from just above @xmath3 ( @xmath510 k ) to @xmath5 40 k. anisotropic @xmath2 data were measured up to 140 koe with field applied along and perpendicular to the rod - like crystals . for the applied field perpendicular to the rod , @xmath2 is linear with a slope @xmath5 - 70 koe / k . for field </S>",
    "<S> applied along the rod , the slope is about -120 koe / k below 70 koe . above 70 koe , the magnitude of the slope decreases to @xmath5 - 70 koe / k . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic specific heat coefficient , @xmath6 , just above @xmath3 , is 73 mj / mol k@xmath7 ; the debye temperature , @xmath8 , is 220 k. the specific heat jump at the superconducting transition @xmath9c @xmath5 2.2 @xmath10 . </S>",

    "<S> , it quickly arouses interest as a potentially new , quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> related compounds , rb@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 , with @xmath3 values of about 4.8 k and 2.2 k respectively were reported soon after the discovery of k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> band structure calculation was also conducted and compared with experimental results@xcite . in the initial report@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , data were acquired primarily on polycrystalline samples of k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 . for q1d superconductors </S>",
    "<S> , it is believed that with magnetic field applied along the chain , the upper critical field , @xmath12 , should be much higher than that when the field is along other directions due to minimized orbital pair breaking . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , this was observed for q1d systems like li@xmath13mo@xmath14o@xmath15 and ( tmtsf)clo@xmath16@xcite . in this paper , we present detailed anisotropic @xmath2 data via resistance measurements on k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , with the recent discovery of iso - structural compound , rb@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 , with a larger unit cell and a lower @xmath3 value , it is interesting to study the pressure - dependence of @xmath3 of k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> results from low - field dc magnetization measurements with pressures up to 7 kbar will be presented .    </S>",
    "<S> k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 single crystals were grown using a high - temperature solution growth method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a schematic drawing of the matryoshka - like ampoule assembly for crystal synthesis is shown in fig .  [ 1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> elemental k , cr , and as ( in bulk / lump form ) were packed in an alumina crucible following the ratio listed in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> ( k : cr : as = 6:1:7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> crucibles and starting material were then welded into a tantalum tube and sealed in a silica ampoule under partial argon atmosphere . to avoid possible explosion due to the high vapor pressure of the un - reacted elements </S>",
    "<S> , the whole ampoule was slowly heated up to 1000 @xmath17c over 2 days . </S>",
    "<S> it was then cooled down over @xmath5 100 hrs to 700 @xmath17c , at which temperature the single crystals and the remaining liquid were separated in a centrifuge by the alumina strainer that was placed in between the growth side crucible and an empty ( catch ) crucible . </S>",
    "<S> the crystals obtained are rod - like ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 1](b ) ) and malleable . </S>",
    "<S> a rough powder x - ray diffraction pattern was collected on ground / deformed crystals using a rigaku miniflex unit located in a n@xmath0 glove box . </S>",
    "<S> the data , along with a fit to the crystallographic data given in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 1](d ) and are consistent with the single crystals adopting the hexagonal , a = 9.983 @xmath18 , c = 4.230 @xmath18 unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> given the unit cell dimensions and single crystal morphology , we identify the rod direction as being along the crystallographic c - axis .    </S>",
    "<S> resistance was measured using a standard 4-probe technique . </S>",
    "<S> dupont 4929n silver paint was used to attach platinum wires onto the sample in a n@xmath0 glove box . </S>",
    "<S> electric current was applied along the rod for anisotropic @xmath12 measurements ( fig .  [ 1](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> long , straight samples were used and supported by flat plastic pads for all resistivity measurements to avoid potential torque that could deform the crystals and thus change their alignment . </S>",
    "<S> resistivity was estimated assuming the sample has a cylindrical shape . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value of the resistivity is therefore only accurate to within a factor of three . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature and field - dependent resistance was measured in a quantum design ( qd ) physical property measurement system , ppms-14 ( @xmath19 = 1.8 - 305 k , @xmath20 = 0 - 140 koe ) . </S>",
    "<S> specific heat data were measured using a qd ppms via relaxation method . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath21he option was utilized to obtain specific heat data down to 0.4 k. specific heat data were measured on a `` raft '' assembled out of several single crystals . despite the fact that samples shape and arrangement was not ideal for such measurements , the coupling constant was high , between 96@xmath22 and 100@xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> the pressure - dependence of the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath3 , was determined via low - field ( 20 oe ) , zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) , dc magnetization measurements in a qd magnetic property measurement system ( mpms ) using a commercial , hmd , be - cu piston cylinder pressure cell@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> daphne oil 7373 was used as the pressure medium and pb was used as the manometer@xcite . since the samples are very air sensitive , exposure to air was limited as much as possible to avoid oxidation .    the temperature - dependence of the resistivity of k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 is metallic as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) is about 50 , a factor of 5 better tan the rrr@xmath510 found for the polycrystalline data@xcite . a clear , sharp , transition at 6.1 k indicates the superconducting transition . at room - temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity is of the same order of magnitude as the reported value@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in contrast to the reported linear temperature - dependence from 7 to 300 k in ref .  , we see a clear deviation from linearity below @xmath5 100 k. for the four samples we have measured , we get slopes of 3.0 , 2.8 , 3.1 and 3.1 from a log(@xmath23-@xmath24 ) vs. log@xmath19 plot between 10 and 40 k. therefore in the left inset of fig .  [ 2 ] , we plot the resistance data from several samples normalized to their value at 40 k as a function of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that a @xmath4 power law describes these data well over the temperature region that is shown . </S>",
    "<S> slight deviation below 10 k might due to the proximity to the superconducting transition . </S>",
    "<S> although we did not see a temperature region where fermi liquid behavior is dominant , this could due to the fact that the measurement temperature is not low enough comparing with its debye temperature . </S>",
    "<S> as will be discussed below , due to the extremely large @xmath12 values associated with this compound , measuring normal state resistivity to low temperatures will require extremely high magnetic fields .    in the normal state , despite a relatively large rrr value , virtually no magnetoresistance was observed . </S>",
    "<S> the right inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 2 ] shows the normalized resistance as a function of applied field for both transverse ( @xmath25 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath26 ) directions of applied field . </S>",
    "<S> right above the @xmath3 , the resistance stays close to constant up to 140 koe . </S>",
    "<S> given this null response , an upper limit of 2@xmath22 ( at 140 koe ) can be set on the low - temperature magnetoresistance .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 3](a ) and [ 3](b ) show the temperature - dependent resistance , @xmath27(@xmath19 ) , measured under different magnetic field for @xmath28 rod and @xmath29 rod respectively . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 3](c ) shows the anisotropic @xmath2 data for k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 from several samples . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition is very sharp in our resistivity measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 3](c ) shows that , at over 125 koe , the onset and offset of the transition differ by less than 0.25 k as opposed to an over 0.6 k width at 80 koe for polycrystalline data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an offset criterion@xcite was used to determine @xmath3 ( see the inset of fig .  [ 3](c ) ) . for field </S>",
    "<S> applied perpendicular to the rod , the @xmath3 decreases almost linearly with increasing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the slope is @xmath5 -70 koe / k . for field </S>",
    "<S> applied along the rod , the initial slope is roughly -120 koe / k , and above 70 koe the slope is close to -70 koe / k , which is similar to that when field is applied perpendicular to the rod . </S>",
    "<S> different batches of samples as well as field - sweep data at fixed temperature give consistent results . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 3](c ) , data from ref .   </S>",
    "<S> are plotted as blue solid diamonds . </S>",
    "<S> it is close to what we obtained for field perpendicular to the rod and the slope is consistent with our current results .    from one - band bcs theory , for a s - wave , isotropic material , in the clean limit , the orbital @xmath30 = -0.73@xmath31d@xmath32@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in our case , for field perpendicular to the rod , @xmath33 312 koe . </S>",
    "<S> the pauli limit for a simple bcs superconductor is @xmath34 = 1.84@xmath3 = 110 koe . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 of real systems will be influenced by both @xmath30 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the maki parameter@xcite that describes the relative importance of the two critical field limits , @xmath35 , is equal to 4 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that at low - temperature , the @xmath12 might be pauli limited . with the current data up to 140 koe that exceeds the one - band bcs </S>",
    "<S> estimated pauli limit , we see no clear sign of saturation of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> note that , with multi - band as well as varying coupling strength , the pauli limit can be different from one - band bcs prediction . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in many fe - based superconductors , @xmath34 values are significantly enhanced@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat data from k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 are shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> 4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> a clear jump in the specific heat at around 6 k corresponds to the superconducting transition . in the normal state </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath36 fits the data quite well . in the range of 7 - 10 k </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained a @xmath6 @xmath5 73 mj / mol k@xmath7 and the debye temperature , @xmath8 , derived from @xmath37 , is around 220 k. these data are consistent with recently reported values@xcite . at the superconducting transition , </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat jump is roughly 2.2 @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this is larger than the simple s - wave bcs prediction and comparable to the value obtained in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> possibly , strong coupling is involved@xcite . below 1.5 k </S>",
    "<S> , we observe a clear upturn in @xmath38 . assuming that the normal state values of @xmath6 and @xmath37 stay constant below @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , this upturn exacerbates the difficulty of having entropy conserved , which was already hinted at in the previously reported data down to 2 k@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additional , non - superconducting contributions , such as impurities or nuclear schottky anomaly , may be responsible for this low - temperature rise . </S>",
    "<S> but whatever its origin is , it makes fitting of the data to specific models problematic .    at ambient pressure , the normal state dc magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath39 = @xmath40/@xmath20 ) is @xmath5 0.9@xmath4110@xmath42 emu / mol and decreases by more than 30@xmath22 from 7 k to 300 k ( fig .  [ 5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we fit these data to a currie - weiss law , we find a temperature - independent susceptibility @xmath43 0.7@xmath4110@xmath42 emu / mol , a small effective moment of 0.36 @xmath44/f.u . </S>",
    "<S> ( or 0.21 @xmath44/cr ) and a curie - weiss temperature , @xmath45 -40 k. at this point in time , it is not clear if such a local - moment fit is appropriate or intrinsic for this material . given that @xmath6 = 9 mj / mol - atom k@xmath7 is relatively high , it is appropriate to contrast it with the magnetic susceptibility . assuming spin = 1/2 , the estimated wilson ratio@xcite , @xmath46 , is in a range of 0.9 - 1.1 by taking the low - temperature magnetic susceptibility value . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider the curie tail as a result of impurity contribution and thus take the value of temperature - independent @xmath47 , @xmath46 is about 0.7 . </S>",
    "<S> these values are close to what one would expect for a fermi - liquid system ( @xmath48 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> zero - field - cooled dc magnetization data are shown in the right inset of fig .  [ 6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition appears sharply at 6.1 k , consistent with both resistance and specific heat measurements . to avoid oxidation , which could affect both sample mass and superconducting volume fraction , </S>",
    "<S> the sample mass was measured in a glove box and exposure to air was minimized .    at 2 k , the low - field @xmath40(@xmath20 ) </S>",
    "<S> data deviate from linear field - dependence at around 70 oe ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 5 ] , inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum in magnetization appears at around 400 oe . taking @xmath49 = 70 oe and @xmath50 = 312 koe and using @xmath49/@xmath12 = ln(@xmath51)/2@xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> , the gl parameter , @xmath51 , is @xmath5100 . from the specific heat jump at @xmath3 using the rutgers relation : @xmath9c/@xmath3 = ( 1/8@xmath53)(d@xmath54)@xmath55@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a similar @xmath51 value of 116 . </S>",
    "<S> this high value of @xmath51 suggests that k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 is deep in the type ii regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the pressure - dependence of @xmath3 is plotted in fig .  [ 6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition of pb was used to determine the pressure within the pressure cell@xcite . as shown in the left inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 6 ] , both superconducting transitions from the pb and the sample are clear . up to 7 kbar , the @xmath3 value for k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 decreases linearly with increasing pressure at a rate of -0.034 k / kbar . </S>",
    "<S> given that the larger - unit - celled rb@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 undergoes a superconducting transition at a slightly lower temperature , 4.8 k , the effects of chemical and physical pressure are clearly not equivalent in this material .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we grew single crystals of k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 using a high - temperature solution growth method . </S>",
    "<S> being able to decant the molten solution at high - temperature allows us to get relatively large , free standing , high - quality single crystals , which also enables us to perform all of our measurements on single crystals or their arrays . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previously reported , linear temperature dependent resistivity from 300 k down to 7 k , resistivity of single crystal , with a rrr of 50 ( rrr@xmath510 for polycrystalline samples@xcite ) , deviates from linear temperature - dependence below 100 k and roughly follows @xmath4 over the range of 10 - 40 k. whereas the differences between the single crystalline and polycrystalline sample transport are easily explained by grain - boundary scattering and potential resistive anisotropies , the rather clear @xmath4 power law that we observe will require more experimental and theoretical investigation . </S>",
    "<S> despite the fact that the temperature - dependence is different , if the rrr values reflect the intrinsic quality of the samples , and are not due to grain boundary scattering , the independence of @xmath3 on the value of rrr , or impurity scattering , suggests a conventional mechanism of its superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic @xmath2 data up to 140 koe were obtained from resistivity measurements . </S>",
    "<S> up to 140 koe , for field applied perpendicular to the rod , @xmath2 is linear with a slope of -70 koe / k . for field along the rod , d@xmath56 is about -120 koe / k . above 70 koe , </S>",
    "<S> the the slope decreases to around -70 koe / k . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 as well as the slope of @xmath12 is close to previously reported data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy in @xmath12 is not as large as one would generally expect for a q1d superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> virtually zero magnetoresistance was observed at temperatures right above the @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic specific heat , @xmath6 , is 73 mj / mol k@xmath7 or 9 mj / mol - atom k@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> although this is a relatively large value , the equally enhanced magnetic susceptibility leads to a wilson ratio that is close to 1 and suggests fermi - liquid - like properties . at ambient pressure </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath49 is close to 70 oe , which result in a gl parameter that is @xmath5100 , taking 312 koe as the estimated @xmath12 . for pressures up to 7 kbar </S>",
    "<S> , the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath3 , decreases linearly with a rate of -0.034 k / kbar . comparing to the newly discovered rb@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , it seems to suggest that physical pressure and chemical pressure have different effect on the superconductivity in these compounds .    </S>",
    "<S> despite the fact that k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 can be considered to be close to q1d in a crystallographic sense , the `` small '' anisotropy in @xmath12 appears to suggest a rather 3d nature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the exotic pairing symmetry requires more detailed study . </S>"
