    "the underlying premise of galactic archaeology is that surveys provide a fossil record of the evolution of the milky way .",
    "mining this record entails the search for sub - clustering in multi - dimensional ( spatial , kinematic , chemical ) datasets . for systems with long dynamical times ,",
    "relatively few dimensions are needed to identify clustering ; e.g. , energy ",
    "angular momentum phase space alone can identify the building blocks of the stellar halo @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the dominant baryonic component of the galaxy - the thin disk - does not fall into this somewhat ` straightforward ' regime .",
    "our thin disk is thought to have been built by many generations of now - disrupted stellar associations , the debris from which having been subsequently scattered / migrated by a convolution of processes , including systematic spiral arm- and bar - driven ` churning ' , and random diffusion - like kinematic heating from giant molecular clouds . before an association has fully disrupted , identifying stellar siblings - i.e.",
    ", the parent birth cloud / association - is relatively straightforward .",
    "spatial , kinematic , and/or phase space coherency can be maintained for a few @xmath0100  myrs ( depending upon cluster mass , concentration , and galactocentric radius / orbit ) .",
    "unfortunately , on the @xmath010  gyr timescale of the thin disk , the combined effects of diffusive scattering and radial migration quickly wash out this coherency , making sub - clustering analysis in low - order spatial and kinematic dimensions a fruitless endeavour ( at least for reconstructing the birth locations of the sea of galactic field stars and searching for our own sun s siblings ) .    to combat this dimensionality ` problem ' , @xcite proposed the use of 10 - 20 dimensions of chemistry - space ( or ` c - space ' ) . dubbed ` chemical tagging ' , the principle hinges on the presumption that if the gas clouds from which the now - dissolved stellar associations formed were chemically homogeneous , even after dissolution and full configuration- and phase - space mixing of the debris , the parent clouds chemical ` fingerprints ' would remain invariant and identifiable .",
    "this presumption has been shown to hold empirically , with chemical homogeneity confirmed on an element - by - element basis ( at the @xmath00.1  dex level , spanning a range of nucleosynthetic processes ) for @xmath120 associations @xcite .",
    "with homogeneity confirmed , the first ` blind ' chemical tagging experiments were conducted @xcite .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic data for field stars were analysed , to attempt a probabilistic approach to identifying cluster populations lurking in the field . though the study presented a means to analyse the datasets from next - generation surveys , no means for explicitly determining cluster / association recovery percentages was presented .",
    "our goal within tracd ( tracking cluster debris : @xcite ) is to build on this pioneering work and characterise parametric and non - parametric approaches to multi - dimensional group finding within c - space , with the goal being the development of tools which can inform upcoming surveys such as galah , weave , and 4most .",
    "as detailed by @xcite , our framework is a static 3-component ( logarithmic halo , plummer sphere bulge , miyamoto - nagai disk ) potential ; @xmath010@xmath2 disk stars , equally spaced in ages up to 10  gyrs old , are evolved with an n - body integrator with treatments of both random molecular cloud scattering and systematic spiral arm churning @xcite applied at each timestep .",
    "this background sea of stars possess kinematics consistent with those of the milky way .",
    "we employ four nbody6 realisations of 250  m@xmath3 stellar associations , each evolved in the same 3-component potential as the background stars ; these are injected into the potential at various galactocentric radii @xmath4 ranging from 4 to 10  kpc ; e.g. , the dissolution time for a cluster injected at the solar circle ( 8  kpc ) is @xmath00.5  gyrs . as stars escape the dissolving association , their trajectories",
    "are tracked with the same integrator advancing the positions of the background stars , and the same diffusion and churning treatments applied .",
    "we tag our background field stars with empirical radial abundance patterns drawn from @xcite , using 10 dimensions of c - space ( al , mg , si , ca , ti , cr , co , ni , y , nd ) . using ( of order ) this number of elements ( @xmath5@xmath010 ) provides the leverage to span the breadth of nucleosynthesis sites , while minimising the search through parameter space . because of the imposed ( i ) radial abundance gradients , and ( ii ) constant star formation history for our disk , the applied diffusion and churning means that we consequently also impose a temporal evolution pattern to the abundance gradient @xcite .",
    "the gradient s dependence on time @xmath6 and radial position @xmath4 is used to tag the mean abundance of the associations injected into the background stars at any given time and location , with the user also imposing an element - by - element scatter @xmath7 to each pre - disrupted system .",
    "an important difference for the latter is that the chemical ` fingerprint ' pattern imposed on the pre - disrupted system is not ` random ' , but instead unique and homogeneous , as per @xcite .    through use of a minimum spanning tree algorithm ( mst - @xcite ) , we attempt to identify the debris of disrupted satellites amongst the background stellar disk . from the 10-dimensional c - space ,",
    "the mst determines a level of similarity @xmath8 between all single stellar components : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respective stars and @xmath12 the abundance for element @xmath13 @xcite . in order to deconvolve the matrix of @xmath8 values into likely parent stellar clusters",
    ", mst begins building a similarity tree . to do so",
    ", stellar components of greatest @xmath8 value are joined as nodes , with subsequent iterations joining less similar stellar components until all stars are placed in the similarity tree .",
    "having created the tree , a parametric exit condition is defined in which the similarity tree is pruned to a value of @xmath8 where the number of clusters , @xmath14 , is present .",
    "fig  [ fig1 ] illustrates the building of a similarity tree for a toy distribution , in which it is built ( right panel ) and subsequently pruned . due to the nature of the similarity matrix",
    ", the parameterised pruning method may dissociate tree constituents .",
    "such dissociation events thus have no cluster association .",
    "as a proof - of - concept , we evolved four systems with @xmath4 ( kpc ) = [ 4,6,8,10 ] for 5  gyrs . to mimic observations",
    ", we filter stars at the end of the simulation to only include those within 3  kpc of our imposed solar neighbourhood ( centred on @xmath15=(@xmath168.5,0,0 )  kpc . to determine the success of the mst cluster ` reconstruction ' , four chemical abundance uncertainties @xmath7 ( dex ) were explored : [ 0.01,0.05,0.10,0.15 ] .",
    "having tagged each star particle ( see fig  [ fig2 ] ) , the mst was deployed , using a parametric exit condition of @xmath17 . from comparisons of the ` real ' cluster constituents vs the mst associations , the successful cluster recovery rates and dissociation percentages were derived ( see tbl  1 ) .",
    ".mst recovery accuracy and dissociation population percentages for different chemical abundance uncertainties . [ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]",
    "we employ a parametric form of the mst algorithm to search for now - dissolved stellar associations , phase - mixed with a background exponential disk of field stars .",
    "both the background sea of stars and the associations themselves were chemically tagged with empirically - motivated abundance patterns and a variety of chemical uncertainties and association injection radii were explored .",
    "not surprisingly , in the absence of chemical uncertainties , the association reconstruction accuracy is high ; equally unsurprising , the accuracy drops dramatically with increasing abundance uncertainties .",
    "while not meant to be exhaustive , the work presented here is a successful proof - of - concept .",
    "various weighting schemes , and non - parametric approaches , urgently need to be explored , alongside more sophisticated multi - dimensional group finding algorithms @xcite .",
