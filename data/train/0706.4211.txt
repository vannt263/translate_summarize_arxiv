    "the history of the mass loss experienced by stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) is a key issue for describing the late stages of evolution of low and intermediate mass ( 16 m@xmath4 ) stars , as well as an important ingredient for the characterization of the cosmic cycle of matter . determining the mass loss rates of red giants",
    "is generally based on modelling radio molecular line profiles ( schier 2007 ) or infrared continuum energy distributions ( van loon 2007 ) .",
    "however these methods are limited to the central parts of circumstellar shells , and , as the mass loss rates of agb stars are variable , it has been difficult to establish a balance of the mass loss over the long periods of time that need to be considered ( 10@xmath510@xmath7 years ) .    in principle the h  line at 21 cm should be a useful tracer of agb circumstellar environments ( le  bertre et al .",
    "hydrogen dominates their composition ( @xmath1  70  % in mass ) and should be in atomic form , at least in the external parts of these shells ( r @xmath8 0.1 pc ) .",
    "however the 21 cm line is weak and generally contaminated by the much more intense galactic emission arising on the same lines of sight . h  line observations of agb stars have long been limited to mira ( bowers & knapp 1988 ) .",
    "however , since 2001 , using the upgraded nanay radiotelescope ( nrt ) , we readdressed this issue and detected several objects in emission , in particular rs cnc ( grard & le  bertre 2003 ) , ep aqr & y cvn ( le  bertre & grard 2004 , paper i ) , and x her ( gardan et al .",
    "2006 , paper ii ) .",
    "recently , we also presented the results of a survey of 22 sources , with 18 new detections ( grard & le  bertre 2006 , paper iii ) . using the very large array ( vla ) , matthews & reid ( 2007 ) detected h  emission coincident in both position and velocity with rs cnc , and reported emission close to , but not unambiguously related to , ep aqr .",
    "they also reported h  emission from the circumstellar shell of r cas .",
    "generally the h  emissions that we detect with the nrt are extended , indicating shell sizes @xmath1 1 pc . in some cases ,",
    "e.g. ep aqr ( paper i ) , they reveal complex spatial and dynamic structures .",
    "the 21 cm line thus probes regions much larger than those that can be studied with molecular lines , which are limited by photo - dissociation ( r @xmath9 0.1 pc ) .",
    "extended shells have also been observed in the far - infrared continuum emission ( 60 and 100 @xmath0 m ) by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras , young et al .",
    "the spatial extension estimated from our h  observations are comparable to , or possibly larger than , those obtained by young et al .",
    "( 1993a ) .",
    "some of the infrared shells appeared detached from the central stars .",
    "the infrared source associated to y cvn was reobserved by the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) , which clearly detected at 90 @xmath0 m a detached dust shell surrounding the central star ( izumiura et al .",
    "these detached shells were interpreted as resulting from the interaction of the expelled material with the interstellar medium ( ism , young et al .",
    "1993b ) , or from a past event of mass loss much higher than today ( izumiura et al .",
    "however the far - infrared data lack crucial kinematic information .    the h  line profiles obtained with the nrt have in general a gaussian shape , with a full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) smaller than , or equal to , the width of the co rotational lines , implying that the expansion velocity decreases outward ( papers i & iii ) .",
    "this slowing - down of the outflows indicates an interaction with local material , either of circumstellar or interstellar origin .",
    "these high - spectral - resolution h  profiles provided the first direct evidence of a slowing - down of circumstellar matter in the external shells of red giants .    in the present paper",
    ", we revisit the case of y cvn , because , as the iso observations show images that are rather rounded , we expect that a spherical symmetry may apply and therefore that the interpretation will be easier . also the source is relatively bright in h , with a low interstellar contamination , so that in principle h  profiles of high quality are accessible . with these favorable conditions",
    "we expect that the h  profile modelling will bring useful constraints on the detached shell characteristics , and more generally on the detached shell phenomenon .",
    "we have acquired new h  data on y cvn in order to improve those already presented in paper i.",
    "y cvn is a j - type carbon star , i.e. a carbon star whose photosphere is enriched in @xmath10c .",
    "the abundance ratio , @xmath11c/@xmath10c @xmath1  3.5 ( lambert et al .",
    "1986 ) , is close to the cno - cycle equilibrium value ( 3 - 3.5 , lattanzio & forestini 1999 ) .",
    "the effective temperature is @xmath1  2760 k ( bergeat et al .",
    "2001 ) , so that atomic hydrogen should dominate over molecular hydrogen in the atmosphere and eventually above it ( glassgold & huggins 1983 ) . however , lambert et al . ( 1986 ) detected a weak 1 - 0 s(0 ) h@xmath12 line at 2.22 @xmath0 m , so that some hydrogen should still be in molecular form within the photosphere .",
    "the abundance analysis performed by lambert et al . shows also that y cvn may have a slightly sub - solar metallicity ( @xmath13 ) , with oxygen showing the most underabundance ( 0.4 ) .",
    "the exact stage of evolution of y cvn is not clear .",
    "j - type stars do not show an enhancement in s - process elements , suggesting that they have not gone through thermal pulses and that the surface carbon enrichment is not due to a third - dredge - up event .",
    "for instance , they might owe their carbon - rich composition to an he core flash when they were still on the red giant branch ( dominy 1984 ) .",
    "the distance derived from the _ hipparcos _ parallax ( 4.59 @xmath14 0.73 mas , perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) is @xmath1  218pc .",
    "this places y cvn at 207pc from the galactic plane in a direction close to the galactic north pole ( b@xmath15 ) .",
    "we adopt the _ hipparcos _ distance , but note that it might be underestimated .",
    "knapp et al . ( 2003 ) have re - reduced the _ hipparcos _ data and give a revised parallax ( 3.68 @xmath14 0.83 mas ) that tends to place the source somewhat further from the sun ( 272  pc ) . also bergeat et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimate the parallax at @xmath1 3.85 mas ( or @xmath1  260  pc ) .",
    "the k magnitude is 0.74 ( guandalini et al .",
    "2006 ) which translates to a bolometric magnitude of 1.96 ( le bertre et al . 2001 ) or @xmath1 6200 l@xmath4  at 218  pc .",
    "such a luminosity places y cvn clearly on the agb , probably on the early agb ( e - agb ) rather than on the thermally pulsing agb ( tp - agb ) .    the proper motion observed by _ hipparcos _ is 2.20 , in right ascension ( ra ) , and 13.05 mas yr@xmath2 , in declination .",
    "when corrected for the solar motion towards apex , it translates to 13.4 and 17.4 mas yr@xmath2 respectively , and for a distance of 218 pc to 14 and 18 kms@xmath2 , with respect to the ( solar ) local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "it corresponds to a motion , in the plane of the sky , towards north - east ( position angle , pa = 38@xmath16 ) .",

    "they determine a lsr radial velocity , v@xmath17= 21.1 kms@xmath2 , an expansion velocity , v@xmath18= 7.8 kms@xmath2 , and a mass loss rate , m = 1.1 10@xmath3 m@xmath4yr@xmath2  ( at 218 pc ) .",

    "a faint asymmetry is suspected in the 2 - 1 data .",
    "an intense emission in the @xmath10co 1 - 0 line , detected by jura et al . ( 1988 ) , confirms the large abundance of @xmath10c in the y cvn outflow .",
    "schier & olofsson ( 2000 ) evaluate the @xmath11co/@xmath10co abundance ratio to @xmath1 2.5 , a ratio larger than the equilibrium value , indicating a possible enrichment in @xmath10c of the co molecule within the outflow .",
    "the mass loss rates estimated from @xmath11co rotational line data may therefore be underestimated by a factor @xmath1 1.4 .",
    "we note also that the underabundance in oxygen , as suggested by lambert et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , would directly translate into an underabundance in co.    an extended emission at 60 and 100 @xmath0 m was discovered by iras ( young et al .",
    "this emission could be modelled with a resolved isothermal shell , at @xmath1 30 - 40 k , of inner radius , r@xmath21@xmath22 , and outer radius , r@xmath23@xmath24 .",
    "an image at 90 @xmath0 m with a better spatial resolution ( @xmath25 ) and a better sensitivity was obtained by iso ( izumiura et al .",
    "it clearly shows a central infrared source surrounded by a quasi - circular detached shell , with r@xmath21@xmath22 and r@xmath23@xmath26 .",
    "this image of a detached shell supports the modelling of the iras data by young et al .",
    "( 1993a ) .",
    "in addition , in the iso image at 90 @xmath0 m , the detached shell seems displaced to the west by about 0.5 - 1@xmath27 with respect to the central infrared source .",
    "nevertheless , the circular morphology of the detached shell and the small size of the offset , as compared to the source diameter , leave no doubt on the association with y cvn . adopting a _ dust - to - gas _ mass ratio of 4.5 10@xmath28 , the mass in the detached shell can be estimated at 0.06 m@xmath4  ( at 218 pc ) .",

    "[ centralpos ] we note a shift in velocity of @xmath1 1 kms@xmath2  between the model pedestal and the observed one around 29 kms@xmath2 .",

    "they need to combine an eruption of mass loss to the interaction with external matter in order to explain the properties of co detached shells .",
    "they obtain thin detached shells with small relative thickness ( @xmath54 0.01 ) . from their modelling",
    ", the cases for which the observed relative thickness is large ( @xmath55 0.1 ) may have another origin .",
    "therefore the mecanism for the formation of the y cvn detached shell might be different from that responsible for the molecular detached shells around carbon stars .",
    "given our low spatial resolution we can not exclude short time ( @xmath1 100 years ) fluctuations of the y cvn mass loss rate such as those found , for instance , for the carbon star irc  + 10216 ( mauron & huggins 2000 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the scenario that we propose for y cvn is correct , we expect to find similar detached shells around other agb stars , and in particular around mass - losing oxygen - rich ones , because there is no reason for it to be specific to carbon stars . from our survey of atomic hydrogen around evolved stars ( paper iii ) we find h  emission from oxygen - rich as well as from carbon - rich stars .",
    "also the h   line profiles that are observed indicate a slowing - down of circumstellar matter at large distance from the central stars .",
    "the spatial resolution of our h  data is limited to @xmath56 in ra .",
    "therefore we have used the iso image at 90 @xmath0 m to better constrain the geometry of the circumstellar shell . on the other hand",
    "the high spectral resolution of our h  data has allowed to study directly the kinematics and the physical conditions within the y cvn detached shell .",
    "also the large collecting area of the nrt has been useful to reach a high sensitivity on the low surface brightness h  emission of y cvn .",
    "however our interpretation remains limited by the low spatial resolution in h  .",
    "for instance , we have used the infrared image as a guide and identified @xmath45 ( h  ) with r@xmath21  ( dust )  and @xmath43 with r@xmath23 .",
    "it implicitly assumes that the dust and the gas spatially coincide .",
    "also the infrared emission depends on the dust temperature which should vary with distance to the central star .",
    "an imaging in h  would allow to constrain directly the gas density within the shell as a function of the distance to the central star .",
    "indeed in our model we have shown that the optical depth is always smaller than 1 and that the temperature in the detached shell is larger than 10 k , so that the h  emission at each position should be directly proportional to the column density .",
    "therefore interferometric data in h   with a high sensitivity and a high spectral resolution would be very valuable to probe the gas physical conditions and kinematics within the detached shell of y cvn .",
    "such high angular resolution imaging in h   should allow to determine clearly @xmath45 and to compare it to r@xmath21 .",
    "it should also allow to determine the offset of the h  detached shell with respect to y cvn .",
    "the spectrally broad component ( 2 ) is expected to be confined to the interior of the gas detached shell , which is expected to be seen only in the spectral band - width corresponding to the narrow component ( 1 ) .",
    "finally , we predict a concentration of hydrogen at @xmath57 0.24 pc ( 3.7@xmath27 , see fig .",
    "[ columndensity ] ) .",
    "other atomic lines , for instance c at 492 ghz , might also be valuable tracers of the gas within the detached shell .",
    "c was not detected by knapp et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; however , they observed on the stellar position with a beam of only 15@xmath29 and a throw of 60@xmath29 ( @xmath58 ) . in the optical range , resonant lines of na or k could be useful .",
    "mauron & guilain ( 1995 ) did not detect any na / k emission , but similarly they looked only close to the central star ( 5@xmath29 ) .    the conditions for the temperature and the density that we find in our model might be favorable to the formation of molecular species through a non - equilibrium chemistry as it has been suggested for some regions of the diffuse ism ( falgarone et al .",
    "in fact as the physical conditions within the detached shell and the timescale can be characterized through modelling , y cvn could thus be a good target for studying this type of ism chemistry .",
    "we have presented high spectral resolution h  data obtained on y cvn with the nrt .",
    "the emission is spatially resolved with a diameter @xmath59 .",
    "the spectrum obtained on the stellar position reveals a rectangular pedestal centered at + 21.1 kms@xmath2  ( comp .",
    "2 ) that traces an 8 kms@xmath2  outflow of @xmath1 1.0 10@xmath3 m@xmath4yr@xmath2 .",
    "this outflow corresponds fairly well to the wind detected in the co rotational lines .    the spectrally narrow component ( comp .",
    "1 ) is centered at + 20.6 kms@xmath2  and traces an expanding gas shell that we associate with the detached shell imaged by iso in dust continuum emission at 90 @xmath0 m ( izumiura et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the bulk gas temperature within this shell is @xmath1 100200 k and the expansion velocity @xmath1 12 kms@xmath2 .",
    "we have developed a simplified model in which the detached shell is produced by a slowing - down of the y cvn outflow by external matter . in this model",
    "the mass loss is taken constant for @xmath1 5 10@xmath6 years with the same rate as presently , i.e. 1.0 10@xmath3 m@xmath4yr@xmath2 .",
    "the sharp decrease of the velocity by a factor @xmath60 is interpreted as due to a shock at the inner boundary ( termination shock ) .",
    "the y  cvn detached shell thus appears to act as a lock chamber where circumstellar matter is stored for a few 10@xmath6 years before being injected in the ism .",
    "we note that in our h  model of the detached shell , we have adopted the same dimensions as those of the dust detached shell .",
    "these dimensions might not apply exactly and a high angular resolution mapping at 21 cm is needed .",
    "it would also provide the exact position of the detached shell with respect to y  cvn .",
    "we find that the surrounding medium which slows down the outflow is almost at rest with respect to y cvn .",
    "although we can not exclude that this external medium is local ism , we suggest that it might rather be made of material left over from an older episode of mass loss , perhaps when the star was on the rgb .",
    "finally , we caution that the mere presence of a detached shell around an agb star is not a proof that the central star has undergone an enhanced episode of mass loss .",
    "we stress the importance of acquiring high spectral resolution data to complement the dust continuum images obtained in the far - infrared .",
