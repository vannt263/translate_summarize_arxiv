    "a fascinating topic in modern quantum many  body physics is the possibility of a supersolid state of matter , i.e. a solid which displays some superfluid properties . since the first theoretical speculations on its existence in the early seventies , supersolid has gained a wide attention.@xcite being such a supersolid phase a direct consequence of macroscopic manifestation of quantum properties , the highly quantum solid @xmath2he was soon recognized to be the natural candidate to realize it ; but it has revealed to be elusive to the experimental observation until 2004 , when the observation of non classical rotational inertia effects ( ncri)@xcite provided the first possible signature of its presence .",
    "many experiments followed the original one,@xcite giving rise to a puzzling scenario : ncri is now observed in torsional oscillator experiments both when solid @xmath2he is inside a porous material as well as in bulk solid @xmath2he , but the detected supersolid fraction @xmath4 shows a strong dependence on the details of the experimental realization .",
    "the observed dependence of @xmath4 on the sample , on @xmath5he concentration@xcite and also on annealing@xcite leads to a largely diffuse conviction that ncri should be essentially ascribed to extrinsic disorder rather than to an intrinsic property of solid @xmath2he .",
    "some aspects of the measurements ( as the metastability at low temperatures , the value of the critical velocity , @xmath4 which vanishes in a continuous way with a dissipation peak , the dependence of @xmath4 on the oscillator frequency ) seem to point in the direction of a liquid of vortices as suggested by anderson.@xcite on the other hand , recent experiments with an high quality @xmath2he crystal@xcite and the observation of a peak in the specific heat in correspondence of the supersolid transition@xcite seem to put some restrains to the interpretation of ncri as purely extrinsic effect .",
    "there is no doubt that defects play a relevant role in ncri , but what happens if a more and more perfect crystal is grown ?",
    "will the supersolid response disappear or some ncri effect survives ? the answers to these questions lie in the properties of the ground state wave function of a quantum crystal .",
    "to what extent particles localization induced by the crystallization process succeeds in overcoming the zero  point motion of the atoms ? is it possible that even in the true equilibrium state a finite amount of intrinsic defects , such as vacancies,@xcite may survive leading to a superfluid response ?",
    "this question concerning the true nature of the ground state of solid @xmath2he is still open.@xcite zero  point vacancies , i.e. vacancies in the ground state of solid @xmath2he , were the first proposed mechanism for the supersolid state.@xcite delocalized defects , acting as a dilute bose gas , undergo a bose ",
    "einstein condensation ( bec ) resulting in superfluid  like properties of the crystal .",
    "but zero  point vacancies have never been experimentally observed , however actual experiments can not exclude them at a concentration lower than about 0.4%.@xcite our understanding of the solid phase of @xmath2he is far from being complete and a full microscopic description that accounts for the whole supersolid phenomenology is still lacking .",
    "even if it is possible to obtain essentially exact results for most properties of solid @xmath2he by means of quantum simulations , e.g. pimc@xcite at finite temperature and spigs@xcite at zero temperature , they do not offer a simple straight way to answer the question of the true nature of the ground state .",
    "such computations give compelling evidence that the commensurate crystal , i.e. a crystal in which the number of particles is equal to the number of lattice sites , has no bec .",
    "much more delicate is the question of the presence of defects like vacancies in the ground state .",
    "whether solid @xmath2he , or any other possible quantum crystal , should have a commensurate or incommensurate ground state is a fundamental question due to the important role of such defects on the occurrence of bec .",
    "quantum simulation of solid @xmath2he with one vacancy@xcite indicates that the energy of this state is above the one of a perfect crystal and this has been taken as evidence that no ground state vacancies are present in solid @xmath2he .",
    "however it has been argued that such quantum simulations present in literature do not allow to directly answer the question.@xcite in fact , in monte carlo simulations of crystals , the small number of particles , the use of periodic boundary conditions and commensuration effect of the simulation box with the lattice structure impose a constraint that makes impossible , in practice , for the system to develop an equilibrium concentration of vacancies.@xcite this holds not only for canonical and micro - canonical computations ( where it should be somehow obvious since the number of particles and the volume of the system are fixed quantities during the simulation ) , but also for grand canonical simulations.@xcite furthermore the equilibrium concentration could be so small to easily have escaped detection in simulations of the ground state of solid @xmath2he.@xcite therefore the equilibrium concentration of zero point vacancies @xmath0 can be obtained only indirectly , by a statistical thermodynamical analysis of an extended system , exactly as for classical solids.@xcite    on the other hand we know two model system that have zero point defects and bec .",
    "this is the case of the quantum solid described either by a jastrow wave function ( jwf ) or by a shadow wave function ( swf ) .",
    "both these wave functions have a more or less successful long career as trial wave functions in variational descriptions of solid as well as liquid @xmath2he .",
    "it is well known that at large densities such wave functions describe a crystalline solid . moreover ,",
    "the presence of bec in such solid phase is stated by a theorem both for jwf@xcite and for swf,@xcite and in the latter case the condensate fraction has recently been estimated.@xcite    furthermore , by following the chester s argument for supersolidity,@xcite it is possible to infer that such translationally invariant wave functions ( jwf and swf ) give rise to a finite concentration of vacancies . even though this argument is common knowledge ,",
    "no estimate exists of how large is such equilibrium concentration of vacancies , except for an approximate calculation done some years ago for jwf.@xcite in this paper we have developed the route outlined by chester and we have exploited the most advanced numerical techniques to estimate the equilibrium concentration of vacancies @xmath0 in the ground state of the quantum solids described by jwf and swf . by a full thermodynamical analysis of the equivalent classical crystal ,",
    "we have estimated @xmath1 for a jwf and @xmath3 for the swf at a density close to the melting one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : meth ] we introduce the jastrow and the shadow wave functions briefly reporting also the chester s argument for vacancy induced supersolidity ; a route for the estimate of the equilibrium concentration of vacancies @xmath0 is outlined in section  [ sec : eqxv ] , which deals also with the numerical tools involved in the computation .",
    "our result for jwf and swf @xmath0 are reported in section  [ sec : res ] and discussed in section  [ sec : con ] which contains also our conclusions .",
    "the ground state wave function for a system of @xmath6 bosons must be symmetric under permutations of the coordinates , and it can be chosen as a real non negative function . the simplest choice for the wave function in the interacting bosons case is represented by the jastrow wave function @xmath7 where @xmath8 accounts for the direct correlations among two particles and @xmath9 is the normalization constant . this wave function is translationally invariant and describes a liquid or a solid depending on the density .",
    "the solid phase comes as a spontaneously broken symmetry effect at large density .",
    "moreover such a wave function has been proved to have a finite bose  einstein condensate fraction even in the solid phase.@xcite there is a formal identity , recognized long ago,@xcite between @xmath10 and the normalized probability distribution in configurational space of @xmath6 classical particles at an inverse temperature @xmath11 interacting via a potential @xmath12 in addition , if as commonly assumed @xmath8 vanishes at large distance , the normalization constant @xmath13 is equal to the canonical configurational partition function of this classical system , so that the logarithm of @xmath9 turns out to be proportional to the excess helmholtz free energy . the chester s argument in favor of the vacancy induced supersolidity lies on this formal analogy.@xcite at large density this equivalent classical system corresponding to @xmath10 is a crystalline solid .",
    "for this equivalent classical system the equilibrium concentration of vacancies @xmath0(@xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of lattice sites ) is non ",
    "zero even if a single vacancy has a finite cost of local free energy and this raises from the gain in configurational entropy.@xcite it is then straightforward to infer that also the quantum solid described by should have the same @xmath0 .",
    "one comment is in order .",
    "the pseudopotential @xmath8 should be determined by minimization of the expectation value of the hamiltonian . in the liquid phase",
    "the quantitative results given by the jwf are reasonable even if not very accurate.@xcite much less so it is in the solid phase .",
    "in fact , with jwf one gets solidification at a density much larger than the experimental value and the particles turn out to be very localized.@xcite a wave function that greatly improves over the jwf is the so called shadow wave function . in fact , swf presently gives the best variational representation of the ground state properties of @xmath2he both in the liquid and in the solid phase.@xcite    in a swf the atoms are correlated not only by standard direct correlations among particles , but also indirectly via the coupling to a set of subsidiary ( shadow ) variables.@xcite integration over the shadows variables introduces effective interparticle correlations between pair of atoms but also between triplets and , in principle , to all higher orders in an implicit way ; this is done so efficiently that it is possible to treat the liquid and the solid phase with the same functional form@xcite without the need to introduce _ a priori _ equilibrium positions to localize the atoms around lattice positions .",
    "even for swf in fact , solidification emerges as a result of a spontaneously broken translational symmetry due to the increased correlations as the density of the system increases .",
    "moreover local disorder processes due to zero point motion are in principle allowed .",
    "this makes the use of such a wave function specially useful in the present context , where our purpose is to investigate the ground state nature of a quantum crystal .    the general form of a swf is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are ,",
    "respectively , the real and the shadow coordinates of the @xmath6 atoms and @xmath9 is the normalization constant . as usual with swf,@xcite @xmath19 is a jastrow function which gives the direct correlations between particles , and we assume a mcmillan form for the pseudopotential:@xcite @xmath20 @xmath21 is another jastrow function giving the inter shadow correlations ; as pseudopotential we use the rescaled and shifted interatomic potential@xcite : @xmath22 @xmath23 is a gaussian kernel coupling each shadow variable to the corresponding real one : @xmath24    when swf is employed as trial wave function in a variational description of @xmath2he , the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 have to be determined by minimizing the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the helium  helium interatomic potential . for instance",
    "when an hcp commensurate crystal with @xmath32 @xmath2he atoms at @xmath33@xmath34 , slightly above the melting density , is considered and the standard aziz potential@xcite is chosen as @xmath31 , the minimization of gives the values @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37k@xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40@xmath41 as optimal values for the variational parameters.@xcite also swf belong to the class of wave functions that display bec even in the solid phase,@xcite and a recent investigation computed the condensate fraction to be @xmath42 at the melting density.@xcite    when performing ground state calculations with a swf by the monte carlo methods , due to the integration over shadow variables ,",
    "two independent kinds of shadow particles must be taken into account in performing averages , as it can be easily seen , for example , by writing the expectation value of a diagonal observable @xmath43 @xmath44 where the probability density @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 @xmath47    a quantum  classical correspondence exists for swf as well.@xcite in fact , there is a formal analogy between eq .   and the probability distribution density in configurational space of @xmath6 classical triatomic molecules with flexible bonds at an inverse temperature @xmath11 interacting via the potential @xmath48\\quad .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] each molecule is then composed by one real ( central ) particle and two shadows . in this quantum  classical analogy",
    "no interaction other than the intramolecular forces corresponding to the real  shadow coupling and the intermolecular forces between particle of the same species ( provided by the real  real , shadow  shadow and shadow@xmath49shadow@xmath49 pseudopotentials ) are present . the statistical sampling of @xmath50 then , maps the quantum system of @xmath6 particles in an equivalent classical system of @xmath6 flexible triatomic molecules with special interactions and the logarithm of the normalization constant is proportional to the excess free energy of such classical molecular system .",
    "furthermore the chester s argument can be extended also to this molecular solid to prove that also swf gives rise to a finite equilibrium concentration of vacancies .",
    "as already pointed out , chester s argument@xcite ensures that in the quantum solids described by jwf and swf ( i.e. the quantum solids whose ground state wave functions are jwf and swf ) have a finite equilibrium concentration of vacancies , whose amount obviously depends on the chosen pseudopotential parameters .",
    "the problem of the estimate such equilibrium concentration of vacancies @xmath0 in the quantum solids at @xmath51 k is then formally equivalent to the computation of @xmath0 in their equivalent classical solids .",
    "the presence of a finite concentration of vacancies at equilibrium conditions means that the partition function @xmath52 of a macroscopic system of @xmath53 particles has contributions from different pockets in configurational space corresponding not only to the commensurate state but also to states with a different number of vacancies ; and the pockets with vacancies give the main contribution.@xcite this translates in the quantum case to say that the wave function @xmath54 of a bulk system is describing at the same time both states with and without vacancies , and that the overwhelming contribution to the normalization constant @xmath52 of the macroscopic system derives from pockets corresponding to a finite concentration of vacancies.@xcite    only about 10 years ago , @xmath0 has been computed for solid @xmath2he by exploiting this quantum ",
    "classical isomorphism@xcite and choosing as wave function a jwf with a mcmillan pseudopotential@xcite . at melting density",
    "@xmath0 turned out to be @xmath55 .",
    "this is interesting but one should keep in mind that jwf gives a very poor description of solid @xmath2he,@xcite moreover the pseudopotential parameters were chosen to stabilize the solid and not to minimize the expectation value of the quantum hamiltonian at the chosen density .",
    "in addition , a quasi  harmonic approximation was used to estimate the free energy cost of a vacancy but the accuracy of this approximation is not known . here",
    "we improve that estimate by employing direct simulations method to compute the involved free energies without any harmonic approximation .",
    "more important , with these methods we compute @xmath0 also for the swf , a wave function that gives a very accurate description of solid @xmath2he.@xcite      pronk and frenkel@xcite outlined a full grand canonical route to estimate the equilibrium concentration of vacancies in the thermodynamic limit for a classical solid . the grand partition function @xmath56 of the crystal accounts for the fluctuations both of the number of particles @xmath6 and of the number of lattice sites @xmath15 .",
    "the canonical partition function of the crystal with @xmath57 vacancies and @xmath15 lattice sites is factorized , under the assumption of non  interacting defects , as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is now the partition function of the crystal with @xmath60 fixed vacancies at given lattice positions and the binomial factor accounts for all the possible configurations of such vacancies .",
    "this assumption allows to recognize in @xmath56 a binomial expansion over @xmath60 that can be replaced with its sum value .",
    "the sum over the lattice site number @xmath15 is approximated with a standard maximum term argument and then the obtained concentration of vacancies at the thermodynamic equilibrium is given by@xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the chemical potential of the defect ",
    "free crystal and @xmath63 is the change in the free energy of the crystal due to the creation of a vacancy at a specific lattice position .    at a first sight ,",
    "the formula for @xmath0 seems to be obtained under the assumption of localized defect , and then should not be used in the case of mobile vacancies .",
    "this is not true , since the canonical partition function @xmath64 can be always factorized over the configurations of the defects even if mobile.@xcite in fact , the partition function @xmath64 is made of static integrations over those particle configurations which are compatible with the presence of @xmath60 vacancies . the corresponding volume in the configurational space can be split in sub - volumes each corresponding to a particular configuration of the @xmath60 defects , i.e. @xmath65 , independently on how much time the defects spend in any configuration . when vacancies are not interacting",
    "all these @xmath65 are equal and eq .",
    "follows .",
    "exploiting thermodynamic relations , the exponent in can be written as @xmath66 ; then , in order to compute @xmath0 , we need the free energy per particle of the perfect , @xmath67 , and of the defected ( i.e. with one vacancy ) , @xmath68 , crystal and of the pressure @xmath69 .",
    "the pressure @xmath69 for a classical solid is quite straightforwardly obtained with the virial method@xcite or from volume perturbations.@xcite convergence of both the methods to the same value would provide a check on the estimated pressure .",
    "the computation of the free energy ( both @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) is less immediate : free energy can not be directly obtained by a single monte carlo simulation.@xcite we recall that the free energy of the equivalent classical solid is related to the logarithm of the normalization constant @xmath9 for the quantum crystal which , also , is never explicitly computed .",
    "let us consider a classical system with interparticle potential energy @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the set of coordinates .",
    "the thermodynamic integration method gives a way for reconstructing free energy differences by integration over a reversible path in the phase space.@xcite in a simulation we are not limited to use a thermodynamic path , rather all the parameters in the potential energy function can be used as thermodynamic variables .",
    "then , in order to obtain the absolute free energy @xmath72 , we must have at one end of the path a system whose free energy is known ( reference system ) , and to the other end we have the system of interest . for solids a popular method is the one of frenkel and ladd@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to reversibly transform the solid under consideration into an einstein crystal . to this end ,",
    "the atoms are harmonically coupled to their lattice sites .",
    "let @xmath73 be the einstein crystal chosen as reference system and let us consider the potential @xmath74 as @xmath75 varies from 0 to 1 the system described by @xmath76 goes from the system of interest ( @xmath77 ) to the reference one ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "it can be easily found that@xcite @xmath79 and then , for the free energy @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the canonical average for a system with potential energy function @xmath82 .",
    "it should be noted that the thermodynamic integration method is intrinsically static , i.e. the derivative of the free energy is obtained in a sequence of equilibrium simulations each for different values of the coupling parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the potential energy for the reference einstein crystal is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the lattice positions ; its free energy is @xmath85 where , @xmath11 is the inverse temperature . in the case of the defected crystal , a particle is removed keeping the simulation box volume and the lattice parameter unchanged .",
    "the spring constants @xmath86 can be adjusted to optimize the accuracy of the numerical integration in and are usually chosen to make the mean  squared displacement equal for @xmath77 and @xmath78.@xcite      in the quantum system @xmath70 corresponds to the so called pseudopotentials , for instance @xmath70 of the equivalent classical solid corresponds to @xmath87 in the case of a jwf .",
    "the method outlined in the previous subsection for computing @xmath0 might be used also for a quantum crystal described by a jwf or a swf .",
    "however some modifications have to be introduced ; due to the peculiar characteristics of the considered classical solids whose thermal equilibrium mimics the zero  point motion of quantum crystals , particles ( or molecules ) can be mobile .",
    "this is particularly true when a vacancy is present .",
    "in such situation the harmonic coupling to lattice positions would produce unbounded fluctuations because of the sudden suppression of exchange processes , which are allowed by the wave function , when @xmath88 .",
    "a trick to bypass this problem is to break the thermodynamic path in two steps . in the first the equivalent classical crystal",
    "is changed into another crystal in which , by acting on the variational parameters , the pseudopotential are made so tight that the zero point motion is strongly reduced and exchange processes are greatly suppressed . in the second step this new crystal is transformed into the reference einstein crystal constructed as prescribed by the frenkel ",
    "ladd method.@xcite we have already underlined that in thermodynamic integration all the parameters in the potential function can be chosen as parameter to define the thermodynamic path.@xcite    by construction the frenkel  ladd method gives access to @xmath65 ; in fact , the vacancy localization is explicitly introduced via the coupling to the einstein crystal where it has a fixed position .",
    "this is true also for our two step thermodynamic path except than for the very beginning of the first step , where the vacancy is able to move . strictly speaking this",
    "would introduce a systematic error , but in practice this error is smaller than the statistical one when only one vacancy is present .",
    "this has been verified by considering statistically independent estimates of @xmath89 which turn out to be compatible within the statistical error .",
    "in fact , thanks to the periodic boundary conditions the most of the sampled configurations ( i.e. the ones where the vacancy occupies a lattice site ) can be rigidly translated to keep the vacancy in the same original position without affecting the computed averages .",
    "we have checked our numerical code for the estimate of the free energy in classical systems with the frenkel  ladd method by reproducing the results in ref .   for a system of soft spheres , both with a single direct thermodynamic path from the interest crystal to the einstein crystal , and with a two steps thermodynamic path as described above .",
    "it is known that the frenkel  ladd method is sensitive to the size scaling.@xcite we have considered then different boxes of increasing size ( different number of lattice sites @xmath15 ) and we have found , for all the considered crystals the correct linear dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath91.@xcite since both @xmath92 and @xmath89 displays the same scaling law , the value of @xmath93 , and then of @xmath0 , shows no appreciable dependence on @xmath15 .",
    "in a first computation we have considered the same wave function studied in ref .  , i.e. we have considered a jwf with a mcmillan@xcite pseudopotential to describe a fcc crystal in a box with @xmath94 at @xmath95@xmath34 . the pseudopotential parameters are @xmath96  and @xmath97 .",
    "as already noticed this @xmath25 value does not minimize the expectation value of the hamiltonian , but it is chosen so that the solid phase is stable at the considered density . to avoid any vacancy mobility problem when computing @xmath68 , the thermodynamic path has been split into two steps .",
    "the first step runs from the jwf crystal ( i.e. the classical crystal equivalent to @xmath98 ) to a jwf@xmath49 crystal obtained by increasing by a factor 1.4 the parameter @xmath25 ; this reduce the lindemann ratio from @xmath99 to @xmath100 , which is small enough to ensure vacancy localization .",
    "the second step links this jwf@xmath49 crystal to an einstein crystal of the type described by eq .   with the same spring constant for all the particles .",
    "in order to ensure a good convergence of the results , we have considered at least 26 values of the coupling parameter for each step and for each value of the coupling parameter as many as @xmath101 sweeps are produced at the equilibrium .",
    "the obtained results for @xmath102 are reported in fig .",
    "[ f : jwf ] both for the first and the second thermodynamic path steps .",

    "our result is about 5 times smaller than the previous estimate @xmath55 of ref .  .",
    "this discrepancy is presumably due to the fact that in the older estimate , the free energy cost of a vacancy was computed relying on an harmonic approximation .",
    "notice that the value of @xmath0 has an exponential dependence on @xmath111 , and it is easy to see that a value of @xmath111 11.2% higher than the one obtained in our computation would give the same @xmath0 value as ref .  .",
    "@xmath0 for jwf turns out to be very small .",
    "this is not too surprising because we know that a jwf can describe a solid but the particles turn out to be much more localized than in @xmath2he .",
    "the outlined method for the evaluation of the logarithm of the normalization constant @xmath9 can be extended also to the molecular classical solid corresponding to the swf .",
    "a convenient way to build the einstein crystal for such swf crystal is to couple each particle of a `` molecule '' ( in the present case two shadows and one real ) to the lattice position with an harmonic spring.@xcite since the choice of the pseudopotential parameters in a variational theory is related to a minimization principle , we choose as parameters the optimal ones to describe solid @xmath2he at @xmath112@xmath34 , a density which is slightly above melting in order to reasonably prevent instabilities .",

    "we have taken into account also two different kind of reference einstein crystals : one with the same spring constant for all the particles and one with different spring constants for shadow and real particles .",
    "the same @xmath0 value is recovered in all the considered cases within error bars .",
    "the obtained @xmath0 for swf is not so far from the actual experimental bound to the zero  point vacancies concentration in @xmath2he of 0.4%.@xcite then improvements in experimental investigations could answer the question if swf describes well also the equilibrium concentration of vacancies in the ground state .",
    "moreover , by using the bec transition temperature @xmath124 for an ideal bose gas with mass equal to the vacancy effective mass as obtained with swf@xcite ( @xmath125 ) as an estimate of the supersolid transition temperature , we obtain @xmath126 mk , which is about 2.3 times larger than the experimental estimated transition temperature @xmath127 mk.@xcite one possible origin of this discrepancy is the fact that @xmath0 is estimated via a variational technique . as we shall discuss later",
    ", the outlined route to compute @xmath0 can be in principle extended to exact techniques .",
    "another origin is the presence of a significant vacancy  vacancy interaction .",
    ".   for @xmath0 is valid under the assumption of non interacting defects .",
    "a key aspect to be investigated is whether in the quantum solid described by swf vacancies interact and then if a dilute gas of vacancies is stable .",

    "this means that we have an hcp crystal with 3 mobile vacancies .",

    "the determination of the vector positions of the vacancies in a crystalline configurations is far from being trivial due to the large zero point motion , to the vacancy being mobile and because the center of mass is not fixed .",
    "our algorithm proceeded as follows : given a configuration explored by the metropolis sampling , we find the crystal lattice which best fits the positions of the real particles ; this is achieved through the construction of a `` gaussian local density '' model which is optimized adjusting the position of the center of mass of the lattice so that the `` molecules '' ( a real and two shadow variables ) fall in high density regions .",
    "then , the position of a vacancy is defined as that site which does not host any atom in its wigner - seiz cell and whose nearest neighbors are not double occupied.@xcite    from the plot of @xmath131 ( fig.[f : corr ] ) , we see that the vacancies explore the whole available distance range .",
    "we may so conclude that no sign of bound state is detected , at least one the scale of the simulation box , and it seems quite improbable a larger range bound state .",
    "similar results is found for two vacancies .",
    "the observed large value for @xmath131 at nearest neighbor distance is an indication of some short range attraction . but this interaction seems not large enough to give a bound state at least for up to 3 vacancies , as evident in the tail of @xmath132 which approaches the unity , i.e. vacancies behave almost like ideal particles for distances beyond about 10  .",
    "we then conclude that the vacancy gas should be stable in bulk swf solid ; and , for very low concentrations , as the expected equilibrium one , the approximation of vacancies as non interacting defects seems to be reasonable . however , the effect of an attractive interaction between vacancies , if not strong enough to lead to phase separation , would affect the equilibrium concentration of vacancies .",
    "for example , the concentration of divacancies is given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the coordination number of the considered lattice ( @xmath136 for hcp and fcc ) and @xmath137 is the gain in the free energy in bringing two single vacancies together to form a pair.@xcite the relation is the one expected from the application of the mass action law to the vacancy association reaction.@xcite the overall effect is that the total concentration of vacancies should somewhat increase with respect to the value computed in the previous section .",
    "we have presented the first quantitative estimate of the concentration of vacancies for a quantum solid described by the swf which has been variationally optimized to describe solid @xmath2he .",
    "we have computed @xmath0 exploiting the formal analogy between the ground state of bosons and the boltzmann weight for classical particles and using advanced simulation methods . at melting",
    "we find @xmath3 .",
    "this is a sizable concentration not too far from the present experiment upper bound for zero point vacancies in solid @xmath2he .",
    "@xmath0 for swf is much larger than the value @xmath1 given by a jwf .",
    "this , presumably , is due to the much stronger localization of particles described by a jwf compared to swf .",
    "the study of two and three vacancies in the hcp crystal within the swf shows the presence of a significant short range attraction but such multiple vacancies do not form a bound state .",
    "swf has been proved to be so successful in describing many properties of solid @xmath2he that it actually represents the best available variational description of @xmath2he .",
    "as all the variational descriptions it suffers of some limitations , for example swf gives a finite condensate fraction also for a commensurate crystal,@xcite which turns out to be zero when computed with exact techniques such as pimc at finite temperature@xcite and spigs at zero temperature.@xcite it has been suggested that this defect of swf might be due to a qualitative lack in the functional form of the wave function , which , probably , misses the description of zero point motion of excitations other than longitudinal phonons , such as the transverse ones.@xcite for this reason some prudence is needed with respect to the relevance of the obtained concentration of ground state vacancies for swf to the real ground state of solid @xmath2he .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "it was argued that if the true ground state has a finite concentration of vacancies , the energy per particle computed in a box with the correct @xmath0 should be lower than the one computed for the commensurate crystal . when the aziz potential@xcite is used as interaction potential for solid @xmath2he in the quantum hamiltonian ,",
    "this property is unfulfilled by swf at their equilibrium concentration of vacancies .",
    "this will be true only if the energy per particle is computed with the potential that has the swf as exact ground state in .",
    "unfortunately such a potential is unknown ; while it is known the one that has the jwf as exact ground state.@xcite it is easy to check , as pointed out on a general discussion in ref .",
    ", that this is not a simple pair potential but it has a very strong 3-body term , which is about 1.3 times the 2-body one in the considered case .",
    "the outlined route for the estimate of the equilibrium concentration of vacancies can , in principle , be extended also to the exact spigs@xcite method which recovers more and more accurate approximations of the true ground state wave function by successive short time projections in imaginary time starting from a swf .",
    "the classical solid equivalent to spigs turns out to be a collection of open polymers whose length ( number of constituent monomers ) is fixed by the number of considered projection steps .",
    "the chester s argument applies also to this polymeric crystal which is expected to have an equilibrium concentration of vacancies .",
    "further investigation with exact technique is not trivial but advisable .",
