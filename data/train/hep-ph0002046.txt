    "the most likely reason for this is the large expected mass of the supersymmetric particles ( @xmath9 tev ) .",

    "@xcite claims that @xmath20 is excluded on the basis of their analysis of opal data .",

    ", we believe that at present it is impossible to _ definitively _ exclude any gluino mass below @xmath21 .",
    "thus , it is of great interest to find additional approaches for discovering and/or constraining light gluinos and the @xmath0-hadrons .    in this paper , we will explore the possibility of detecting @xmath0-hadrons at large @xmath22 in @xmath3 and @xmath23 fixed - target interactions .",
    "our calculations will be restricted to the @xmath24 gev region where we can be confident that the semi - perturbative techniques that we employ are reliable .",

    "other fragmentation functions would soften these distributions . note that for any fragmentation function to factorize , it must be independent of the initial state ( _ i.e. _  it only depends on @xmath53 and not @xmath54 ) .",

    "our model predicts that the contributions of higher - twist intrinsic states lead to strong flavor correlations between initial and final states for @xmath181 .",
    "the large intrinsic gluino enhancements at high @xmath22 over the leading - twist predictions imply that this region of phase space could be especially appropriate for @xmath0-hadron searches in the light gluino scenario . for @xmath192 in the @xmath193 range , a mass region where substantial evidence for the analogous intrinsic heavy quark states exists and for which our computational techniques should be most reliable , the enhancements are very significant ( factors of several hundred to several thousand being common ) .",
