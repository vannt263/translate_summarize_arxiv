    "we can use elementary algebra to reduce the matrix to a diagonal form , where the diagonal elements each are divisors of the next ones down the main diagonal .",

    "the former consists of two families of discs @xmath470 for @xmath471 and @xmath472 for @xmath473 .",
    "clearly the geometric intersection matrix for this disc system is symmetric , with the action of @xmath131 interchanging rows and columns .",
    "now by our topological assumptions , we know that @xmath428 .",
    "hence we know that the intersection matrix has zero determinant working in @xmath11 .",
    "our aim is to do row and column operations simultaneously to convert the matrix to have all row sums ( and therefore also columns sums ) even .",
    "then the dual triangulation will be @xmath131equivariant , with two vertices and all edges of even degree .",
    "the triangulation will project to a triangulation of @xmath4 with the required properties .",
    "consider the first column of the intersection matrix . if there is a one in this column , we can permute rows to shift this to just below the main diagonal .",
    "( recall that the main diagonal entries are all zero , since the corresponding intersection numbers are even ) .",
    "we can now zero out all the entries below so that there is a single one in the first column , using row operations and the corresponding column operations .",
    "otherwise all the entries in this column are zero . by induction",
    "it follows that we can arrange that all the entries which are not adjacent to the main diagonal , are zero , by following the same procedure . since row and column operations do not affect the determinant which is still zero in @xmath11 .",
    "note that each column and each row of our matrix has at most two entries @xmath455 and all other entries zero .",
    "moreover if the matrix is non - zero , there are at least two columns with a single entry @xmath455 .",
    "if the matrix can be decomposed into diagonal blocks , we can clearly work with the blocks individually .",
    "note that at least one such block must have determinant zero and the other blocks could have determinant @xmath455 .",
    "so in the case of blocks we have to explain how to deal with the blocks with non - zero determinant . to start with , we assume there is a single block . in particular , this means we can assume there are no columns with all zero entries .",
    "we divide the argument into cases . for the first case ,",
    "assume we have a @xmath474 block with @xmath475 and the first and last column have a single @xmath455 and all other columns have two @xmath455 entries .",
    "perform the following column and row operation on the block .",
    "add copies of columns @xmath476 for @xmath477 to column @xmath455 and similarly for rows .",
    "it is easy to verify this produces a matrix where each row and column sum is even ; in fact there are precisely two entries @xmath455 in each row and column .",
    "next , if we have a block matrix , possibly with some zero blocks , so long as the non - zero blocks are of the form in the previous paragraph , clearly the same argument works .",
    "so we are left with the case of some @xmath478 blocks .",
    "since the matrix has non - zero determinant , there must be either some zero blocks or some @xmath474 blocks with @xmath475 .",
    "if there is a zero block , then a simple process converts a @xmath478 block into a @xmath479 block .",
    "namely add a column and row of the @xmath478 block to an adjacent zero block .",
    "so the problem is reduced to a final case , where there is a combination of @xmath474 blocks and @xmath478 blocks with no zero blocks .",
    "consider the case of an adjacent @xmath478 block and a @xmath474 block .",
    "add a copy of each of the two columns of the @xmath478 block to each of the first and last columns of the @xmath474 block and do similar row sums .",
    "it is easy to verify that this converts all the four columns with a single @xmath455 entry to have two @xmath455 entries and likewise for the rows .",
    "hence this completes the proof in all cases .    as mentioned in the introduction , a key result due to lubotzky",
    "@xcite is that any complete hyperbolic @xmath3manifold of finite volume has a finite sheeted covering so that the rank of @xmath11homology is arbitrarily large .",
    "theorem  [ thm : closedexist 1 ] therefore implies :    any closed hyperbolic @xmath3manifold of finite volume has a finite sheeted covering with a 1vertex even triangulation .",
    "[ exa : minimal counter ] the seifert fibered space @xmath480 in the  closed orientable census \" of regina  @xcite has a unique minimal triangulation with four tetrahedra and the degree sequence of the edges is @xmath481 now @xmath482 and hence @xmath7 maps onto @xmath483 whence @xmath4 has an even triangulation .",
    "an even triangulation with six tetrahedra was found by applying pachner moves to the minimal triangulation ; the degree sequence of the edges is @xmath484 the edge of degree 12 meets each tetrahedron in a pair of opposite edges .",
    "the quadrilateral surface has two components : an embedded klein bottle and an immersed surface of euler characteristic @xmath485 the klein bottle meets each tetrahedron in the quadrilateral disc disjoint from the degree 12 edge and is a 1sided heegaard splitting surface for @xmath71    suppose @xmath4 is a closed , orientable , irreducible @xmath3manifold and there is a representation of @xmath7 onto @xmath139 or @xmath49 .",
    "is there an even triangulation of @xmath4 with exactly one vertex ?",
    "the binary tetrahedral and binary octahedral spaces are interesting examples to resolve .",
    "[ rem : ideal prop+constr ] many of the arguments used in this section work when some or all of the vertex links have non - positive euler characteristic , and hence can be applied to general 3dimensional pseudo - manifolds @xmath66 however , more cases arise as the number of ideal vertices in the cover may be smaller than the covering degree times the number of ideal vertices in @xmath66 moreover , there are analogous constructions of even ideal triangulations using 1sided or 2sided splittings into compression bodies .",
    "haken @xmath0manifolds are defined in @xcite . in particular , a closed orientable haken @xmath0manifold can be cut open along a collection of embedded closed and compact orientable hypersurfaces called a _ hierarchy _ to a collection of @xmath0cells , termed haken cells .",
    "these cells have a boundary pattern given by a decomposition of the boundary of each cell into polyhedra .",
    "the polyhedra are the intersections of the hypersurfaces of the hierarchy with the boundary of the haken cell .",
    "we are especially interested in when the hierarchy is as ` short as possible ' . in dimension three ,",
    "such hierarchies are called _ very short_. it is clear that we need to cut along at least @xmath0 collections of hypersurfaces , so when this number is sufficient , the hierarchy is deemed very short .",
    "it is well - known that haken @xmath3manifolds all have very short hierarchies but in higher dimensions this is an open question .",
    "a haken @xmath0cell coming from a very short hierarchy is an @xmath0dimensional polytope with the property that the codimension one faces can be @xmath0coloured , so that no two faces sharing a codimension two face have the same colour . in particular",
    ", we see that at every vertex of the polytope , the faces take all possible @xmath0 colours .",
    "now consider the dual triangulation to the cell structure of the boundary of an @xmath0dimensional polytope with such a colouring scheme .",
    "this is a triangulation of @xmath486 and the vertices are dual to the faces and hence are @xmath0coloured so that no two vertices at the ends of an edge have the same colouring .",
    "but this is precisely what we get from our labelling scheme in ",
    "[ sec : sym reps and normal ] .",
    "in particular , the triangulation must be even .",
    "since the fundamental group of @xmath486 is trivial for @xmath487 , it follows that the canonical symmetric representation has trivial image .",
    "conversely , suppose we start with any even triangulation of @xmath486 .",
    "the canonical symmetric representation must have trivial image since the fundamental group is trivial .",
    "hence there is a labelling of the vertices of the type we want , so that any two vertices at the ends of an edge have different labels .",
    "so if we consider the dual cell structure , this can be viewed as the boundary of an @xmath0polytope where the faces are @xmath0coloured .",
    "so this shows that haken @xmath0cells coming from very short hierarchies have boundaries which are dual to even triangulations .",
    "finally , the haken condition says that each pair of faces of the polytope meet in a single @xmath15face and if three faces intersect in pairs in @xmath15faces then they meet together in an @xmath68face . translating this into a condition on the dual triangulation means that no two edges share two vertices and if three edges have vertices in common , then they are the boundary of a triangle",
    "so we can form a haken @xmath0manifold with a very short hierarchy by choosing a collection of even triangulations of @xmath486 with the properties that no two edges share two vertices and if three edges have vertices in common , then they are the boundary of a triangle .",
    "we can then @xmath0colour the dual cell decompositions and can glue these together in a colour preserving manner .    for",
    "a simple example , consider gluing up a @xmath3cube to form a @xmath3torus .",
    "the corresponding even triangulation of @xmath488 is clearly an octahedron and the corresponding colouring gives opposite vertices the same colour .",
