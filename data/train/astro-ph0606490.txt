    "the presence of a bar or other asymmetric perturbation of the gravitational potential within a spiral galaxy can strongly influence the dynamics of the gas and the stars .",
    "bars are commonly formed within dynamically unstable galactic discs . during their evolution",
    "they can experience vertical buckling instabilities , which thicken the bar and increase the vertical velocity dispersion @xcite , and which we now know can be recurrent @xcite .",
    "bars are present in up to 70@xmath0 of spiral galaxies ( knapen , shlosman & heller 2000a ; eskridge et al . 2000 ; grosb@xmath1l , patsis & pompei 2004 ) , indicating that they must be long lived components of a galaxy .",
    "this strong conclusion is confirmed by recent results suggesting that the bar fraction is roughly constant out to @xmath2 ( e.g. , jogee et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "dust lanes are often seen within large scale bars , offset from the bar major axis .",
    "the main families of periodic orbits making up the bar are elongated parallel to the bar , and perpendicular orbits are present if one or more inner resonances exist ( contopoulos & papayannopoulos 1980 ) , so called @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbits , respectively . at the location of such resonances , between the bar pattern speed and the period of the radial oscillations of the stars and gas , the stellar orbits abruptly change orientation .",
    "the gas orbits can only do this gradually , and this leads to the existence of shocks within the bar .",
    "the compression of this gas is manifested by increased dust extinction .",
    "the shocks can lead to angular momentum loss in the gas , as a result of which the gas will flow in towards the nucleus until it stalls in a ring - like region in the vicinity of the inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) , where there is no net torque acting on the gas ( knapen et al .",
    "1995a , hereafter k95a ; heller and shlosman 1996 ) .",
    "the accumulation of gas in such a nuclear ring can easily lead to enhanced massive star formation ( heller and shlosman 1994 ; k95a ) .",
    "such star forming rings are found within the central 1 - 2 kiloparsec of 20@xmath0 of spiral galaxies , practically all barred @xcite , and are traced by strong line emission .",
    "overall , nuclear rings contribute around 3 - 5% to the local star formation rate @xcite , and may play a role in the secular evolution of galaxies ( see review by kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "the galaxy m100 ( = ngc  4321 ) was chosen as the focus of this study due to its relative proximity ( 16.1  mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , giving a scale of 70 parsec per arcsec , and the moderate strength of its bar .",
    "the bar strength ( @xmath5 ) of m100 has been estimated at 0.2 by laurikainen & salo ( 2002 ) , who suggest that significant asymmetric forces are present for bar strengths of @xmath6 .",
    "m100 exhibits a particularly clear resonant circumnuclear structure which has been described in detail by k95a and knapen et al .",
    "( 1995b , hereafter k95b , and 2000b , hereafter k00 ) . the morphology changes dramatically between wavebands . in the _ k _ band , a small - scale bar is clearly visible , at the same position angle ( pa ) as the large - scale bar ( see also section 6.3 ) .",
    "the picture , therefore , is of a single bar dissected by a nuclear ring .",
    "hotspots of _ k _ band emission are located at the ends of the inner part of the bar . in blue optical light , as well as in h@xmath7 emission ,",
    "a bright star - forming two - armed spiral structure is evident , delineated by the offset dust lanes which can be traced inwards through the main bar , through the ring , and towards the centre .",
    "we define the contact points as the locations on the ring dissected by a line through the nucleus and perpendicular to the bar major axis .    in this paper , we present stellar and gas kinematics , absorption line indices ( h@xmath8 , mg@xmath9 and fe5015 ) , and _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "( _ sst _ ; werner et al . 2004 ) near- and mid - infrared imaging across the nuclear ring and bar region in m100 .",
    "we aim to study the detailed interplay between the dynamics on the one hand , and the ancient and recent history of the star formation in the bar and ring on the other .",
    "this is the second paper presenting results from our new dataset on this galaxy . in the first paper ( allard , peletier & knapen 2005 ; hereafter paper  i ) we presented emission line and gas velocity dispersion maps which showed how massive star formation occurs at the precise locations of relatively cool gas , and related these results to the dynamical origin of the ring in terms of a resonance structure set up by the bar . the current paper is structured as follows : section 2 describes the observations , data reduction and analysis of the sauron and _ sst _ data , section 3 briefly describes the morphology and line ratios , section 4 concentrates on the kinematics , and section 5 on the stellar populations .",
    "our discussions and conclusions are presented in sections 6 and 7 .",
    "the central region of m100 was observed with the sauron @xcite integral field unit ( ifu ) , mounted to the william herschel telescope ( wht ) , on la palma on 2003 may 2 . to cover the whole bar region ,",
    "three separate pointings were made , the positions of which are shown in fig .  1 of paper  i. each separate field of view covers an area of 33@xmath1041 arcsec on the sky , which is mapped by a lenslet array , containing 1431 square lenses of 0.94@xmath100.94 arcsec in size .",
    "a further 146 lenses are available 1.9 arcmin away from the field for simultaneous observation of the sky background . after passing through the lenslet array ,",
    "the light from the source enters a transmisson filter , which is tilted to prevent overlap of the spectra on the ccd array .",
    "the filter allows the wavelength range 4760 - 5400 to be observed .",
    "the large number of spatial elements in sauron limits the wavelength coverage due to lack of space on the ccd array ( eev 12 with 2148@xmath104200 pixels ) .",
    "this range was chosen as it contains the stellar absorption features h@xmath8 , mg@xmath9 , some fei features , and the emission lines h@xmath8 , [ oiii ] and [ ni ] .",
    "the light through each lens is then dispersed by a spectrograph , giving 1577 spectra on the ccd array .",
    "each field was exposed for 3@xmath101800s , and dithered by one or two lenses to avoid systematic errors .",
    "each single exposure was taken between two comparison neon lamp exposures for accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "standard stars were also observed for flux calibration , and continuum and sky flat exposures were taken for flat - fielding .",
    "the seeing was around one arcsec during the night and the conditions were clear but not entirely photometric .",
    "the data were reduced , extracted and calibrated using the specially developed xsauron software @xcite .",
    "firstly , the raw images are bias and dark subtracted using standard methods .",
    "next , each individual spectrum must be extracted from the 2d image and placed in its correct position within a datacube .",
    "this requires the creation of a mask model , which finds the position of each individual spectrum .",
    "datacubes of all the object , lamp , and flat field exposures are created .",
    "the neon lamp datacubes are used to calibrate the wavelength dimension , and the continuum lamp and sky flat datacubes are used to remove low frequency flat field effects . the spectral resolution of each lens may be different , due to optical distortions across the field .",
    "@xcite found that the instrumental spectral resolution can range from 90kms@xmath11 in the centre to 110kms@xmath11 in the outer regions .",
    "this had to be corrected since multiple exposures of the same object are to be combined , which may fall on different regions on the detector .",
    "the instrumental resolution is measured from the sky flat datacube , and each lens is then smoothed to the lowest resolution ( @xmath12=2.1   ) using a gaussian convolution .",
    "cosmic rays are removed using an algorithm which contains both spatial and spectral morphological criteria , the sky background is subtracted , and the object datacube is flux calibrated using the standard stars observed .",
    "the wavelength range of each lens will vary slightly across the field .",
    "this is due to the filter being tilted to avoid ghost images . to achieve a common range all the spectra are truncated to the range 4800 - 5380   . to merge the three 1800s exposures , an image is created by integrating the total flux and collapsing each datacube along its spectral dimension . as standard stars",
    "were not taken after each galaxy exposure to save time , the datacubes are normalised to correct for small errors in the flux calibration . using the integrated images",
    ", the datacubes can be recentred on a bright star or object within the field .",
    "the separate regions of the galaxy observed are then mosaiced to produce one large datacube .",
    "as there is only a small region of overlap between the three fields , there are no bright objects with which to match the fields together . instead ,",
    "the pas and ra and dec of each field were obtained from the file header , and used to calculate the rotation and offsets needed to mosaic the field together and align it north - east .",
    "an h@xmath7 image of the galaxy was used to verify that this had worked correctly .",
    "the final datacube has a new spatial grid with a sampling of 0.8@xmath100.8 arcsec , a spectral sampling of 1.1  and now contains 5775 individual spectra .",
    "the datacube was spatially binned using the voronoi 2d binning method of @xcite to achieve a minimum signal to noise ratio across the field to extract accurate kinematics and line strengths .",
    "the data were binned to a signal to noise ratio of 60 per resolution element which resulted in 802 bins .",
    "the bins have been left unsmoothed in all subsequent images used in this paper .     has been subtracted .",

    "units are in kms@xmath11 . in this figure , and all following figures , north is up and east is to the left.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the spectrum of m100 contains contributions from each star along the line of sight .",
    "the spectral features are broadened due to the differences in velocity between the stars which were observed with each sauron aperture .",
    "the observed spectrum is a superposition of the spectra of these stars , and , assuming they share the same kinematics , can be well described by the sum of the spectra representative of the stellar population , each convolved by the line - of - sight - velocity distribution ( losvd ) .",
    "in addition to stars , gas is also observed along the line of sight , and so the spectrum of m100 additionally contains a number of strong emission lines ( h@xmath8 , [ oiii ] , [ ni ] ) .",
    "this gas contribution needs to be removed to obtain a clean stellar spectrum before any absorption line strengths can be determined .",
    "the sauron stellar kinematics of m100 were obtained by the fitting of its spectra with a linear combination of single - age , single - metallicity population models from @xcite convolved with a gauss - hermite parametrization of the stellar losvd ( gerhard 1993 ; van der marel & franx 1993 ) .",
    "the best - fitting parameters were determined using the penalized pixel fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite , which allows the exclusion of the regions containing strong emission lines .",
    "the adopted template library contains 48 models with ages ranging from 250  myr to 17.78  gyr , and metallicities ranging from @xmath131.68 to @xmath140.20 [ fe / h ] .",
    "this library is similar to that used by @xcite and @xcite for the analysis of spiral galaxies .",
    "the procedure to measure the gas kinematics has been refined since paper i. we now follow the new procedure as described in @xcite in which the gas emission lines are treated as additional gaussian templates , which are fitted to the data simultaneously with the stellar population models .",
    "furthermore , the fitting of the emission lines has been performed unconstrained , allowing the derivation of separate [ oiii ] and h@xmath8 kinematics .",
    "our previously determined gas kinematics were derived by fitting the emission lines together , and as h@xmath8 is the dominant line over most of the field , the gas kinematics of paper i are closely matched by the h@xmath8 kinematics presented in this paper .",
    "once the gas contribution has been successfully estimated , it can be removed from the original galaxy spectrum to produce a clean , emission free stellar spectrum , and this is repeated for each spectrum in the datacube .",
    "this cleaned datacube is used for the measurements of absorption line strengths .      the stellar dispersion map ( fig .",
    "1b ) shows an unusual area of high dispersion offset toward the south - west of the centre by @xmath15(ra)@xmath16arcsec , @xmath17arcsec .",
    "this area is also visible to a lesser extent in the dispersion maps for the gas emission lines .",
    "an effect such as this could be produced by an inaccurate homogenisation of the spectral resolution across the field , so this step in the data reduction process was investigated more carefully .",
    "it should be noted that this data reduction process is identical to that used for other sauron papers @xcite and no issues of this kind have been seen before . to check whether the correction made was adequate ,",
    "the same correction was applied to one of the lamp datacubes for each of the three positions , and the dispersion of the lamp lines was then measured .",
    "a residual gradient was found of around 0.2   , or 10  kms@xmath11 , in each of the three fields .",
    "a correction map was created which was applied to the stellar dispersion map , but the problem area remained .",
    "not only was this residual dispersion not large enough to account for the observed region of high dispersion , it affected the three fields in the same way , whereas the high dispersion region is predominantly in the eastern field .",
    "as all the observations were taken on the same night without any large movement of the ccd and instrument it is unlikely that the resolution of the lens changed between observations .",
    "furthermore we used lamp datacubes instead of the sky flat datacube to compute the spectral resolution correction for each corresponding object datacube , but the high dispersion region remained in each case .",
    "we also checked whether the proximity of the sky lenses to the galaxy could cause strange features within the object spectra , and found that this was not the case .",
    "@xcite presented ifu observations of the stellar kinematics of m100 for the central 33@xmath1029 arcsec .",
    "their stellar velocity field agrees very well with ours , but their maps show no sign of this high dispersion region .",
    "we conclude that , even though the stellar velocity dispersion on the eastern side of the centre might appear too high , we can not identify an observational or instrumental cause .",
    "it is important to notice , however , that whatever causes this effect will only impact on the stellar and gas dispersion maps , and not the gas fluxes , or the line ratios , as these measurements are not dependent on the width of the spectral features .",
    "the line strength measurements are affected , since they are corrected for velocity dispersion ( see section 5.1 ) , but the corrections are small ( @xmath18 0.2 ) since the velocity dispersions are @xmath18100kms@xmath11 ( see , e.g. , davies , sadler & peletier 1993 ) .",

    ". the metallicity of the gas can also affect the [ oiii]/h@xmath8 ratio , but as metallicity does not change abruptly within a single galaxy , large fluctuations in [ oiii]/h@xmath8 within a galaxy are likely to be caused by changes in the ionisation mechanism @xcite .",

    "it is possible to discriminate between various models of non - circular motions ( e.g. , radial flows , warps , elliptical streaming ) by an inspection of the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 terms .",
    "the coefficient @xmath41 is always dominant , and relates to the amplitude of the rotation curve .",
    "all other coefficients are commonly expressed as fractions of @xmath41 .",

    "the @xmath43 term reveals asymmetric structures in the disc , where a constant non - zero @xmath43 is a signature of a global , elongated potential such as a bar , whereas fluctuations in @xmath43 reveal localised structures such as spiral arms .",
    "the velocity field reconstructed from the derived coefficients will reproduce the overall rotation and non - circular motions of the observed velocity fields .",

    "the analysis is restricted to the central 60@xmath1040 arcsec because only for this area the velocity field is fully sampled at a given radius .      the gas velocity fields of [ oiii ] and h@xmath8 ( fig .",
    "9 ) both show slightly faster rotation than the stars , and are more complicated .",
    "h@xmath8 rotates slightly faster than [ oiii ] at larger radii . in the central 30 arcsec diameter region which contains the nuclear ring ,",
    "k00 reported two distinct sets of features in the h@xmath7 velocity field which they related to non - circular motions due to gas streaming around the nuclear part of the bar and the spiral arms just outside the nuclear ring .",
    "we confirm the existence of these features in our gas velocity fields .",
    "firstly , we see the distinct s - shaped deviation due to the inner part of the bar in the velocity contours of h@xmath8 , at a radius of @xmath45 arcsec , which is also apparent but less clear in the [ oiii ] velocities .",
    "secondly , at a radius of @xmath46 arcsec we see the spiral density wave streaming motion as a set of deviations from circular motion , but in the opposite sense as those due to the inner part of the bar .",
    "similar effects on the iso - velocity contours are regularly seen in the central regions of other galaxies observed using ifus ( e.g. , hernandez et al . 2005 ; ganda et al .",

    "k00 used their kinematic observations to confirm the predictions from the three - dimensional numerical modelling of k95a .",
    "this model required the existence of two ilrs in the region , with the nuclear ring lying at the inner ilr .",
    "they explained the origin of the non - circular motions firstly , as gas streaming along the inner part of the bar , and secondly , as the effects of a bar - induced spiral density wave .    in paper",
    "i we presented a map of the combined h@xmath8 and [ oiii ] gas velocity dispersion , which shows a ring of lower dispersion gas , lying at the exact position of the nuclear ring as seen in h@xmath8 emission .",
    "we suggested that massive stars are forming from the relatively cool gas which flows in from the disc through the bar ( paper  i ) , consistent with the very low values of [ oiii]/h@xmath8 seen in the ring . in fig .",
    "9 , we show the gas velocity dispersion separately for h@xmath8 and [ oiii ] .",
    "these maps obviously show the same structure as the combined map presented in paper i , albeit with a lower signal to noise ratio . also , the [ oiii ] gas velocity dispersion does not reach values as low as h@xmath8 within the ring , and has a much higher value in the centre .",
    "this can be understood considering that the [ oiii ] lines are not as reliable as h@xmath8 to trace the denser and dynamically colder components of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , where star formation is more likely to occur .",
    "indeed sources other than ionisation by o - stars can contribute efficiently to the production of [ oiii ] , such as shocks and agb stars .",

    "the mg_b _ and fe5015 indices increase as a stellar population ages , so combining these indices with h@xmath8 allows a more accurate estimate of the age of a population . to use the model predictions of bc03",
    "we must first make assumptions on the star formation history of m100 , for example whether the star formation has been continuous , or has consisted of discrete bursts .",
    "figure  12 shows the time evolution of the mgfe50 index versus the h@xmath8 index for a single burst stellar population ( ssp ; solid line ) , as well as for continuous star formation ( dashed line ) .",
    "we chose to adopt solar metallicity throughout this paper , but fig .",
    "13 justifies this choice by showing the effect of sub- and super - solar metallicity on the part of the h@xmath8 versus mgfe50 diagram relevant to the nuclear data point .",
    "we see that it is impossible to fit this nuclear point with a sub - solar metallicity , whereas a fit with super - solar metallicity implies an age of less than 1.5gyr .",
    "this age is rather less attractive than the 3gyr age estimated from the curves at solar metallicity , however , we are strictly speaking unable to distinguish between the two metallicities .",
    "we have adopted to use solar metallicity in all following models , although it should be noted that increasing the metallicity to sub - solar will scale down all ages , although relative ages will not be affected .    the basic trend in fig .",
    "12 is that mgfe50 increases steadily with time for an ssp , and h@xmath8 first increases rapidly , peaks at around 250  myr , then decreases gradually . the nuclear point ( diamond )",
    "is well fitted by this ssp at an age of 2.5 - 3  gyr . at other locations",
    "this model also appears to be a reasonable fit , such as in the bar ( triangles ) .",
    "the points within the ring ( squares ) , however , are not well fit , and so an ssp can not be dominating the spectrum",
    ". a composite population must be built up to match these ring points .",
    "figure  12 also shows the mgfe50 index versus the h@xmath8 index for a population with a continuous star formation rate ( dashed line ) but this does not fit any of the points . for continuous star formation , the values of mgfe50 increase much more slowly , and values of up to 3.5 such as we observe in the nucleus and bar would not be obtainable within the lifetime of the universe .      the location of the ring apertures in fig .",
    "12 can be explained as a luminosity weighted combination of relatively few , but bright young stars of a few tens of myr in the ring , and of many more , less bright , and much older bulge stars , a few gyr old . to model this , we start out by constructing rather simplistic double burst models , which we then develop into more realistic multi - burst models in sect .  5.3.3 .",
    "there are two basic free parameters when constructing double burst models , namely the delay between the first star formation event and the second , and the relative masses ( amplitudes ) of the stellar populations created .",
    "changing these two parameters affects the spectral indices in similar ways . to demonstrate this ,",
    "models with the same burst amplitudes but two different delays , of 3 and 10gyr , are shown in figure  14 .",
    "increasing either the relative amplitude of the second burst or the delay between the two bursts causes the model tracks to move to the upper left in the index diagram ( higher h@xmath8 and lower mgfe50 ) .",
    "this means that we can not fit a unique model to the nuclear ring apertures , as a number of different combinations of burst amplitudes and burst delays would fit our data points .",
    "we can , however , use such families of models to exclude certain past histories of star formation , and to identify the most plausible ones .",
    "to start , we assume an underlying bulge and disc population in m100 as the result of a star formation event which occurred up to 3  gyr ago , a timescale which coincides with our estimated age of the nuclear point in m100 .",
    "the exact time at which this initial burst of star formation occurred is not critical , as the spectral indices change only very gradually with time for stars over 2  gyr .",
    "we set time , @xmath53 , to 0 at the end of the first star formation event .",
    "the exact nature of this initial event ( e.g. , single burst , multiple burst ) is also unimportant .",
    "what _ is _ important is that by far most of the stellar mass was formed in this past event ( see the implausibility of the high relative second burst strength models in fig .",
    "14 , shown in blue ) .",
    "we know that star formation is occurring now in the ring from the presence of h@xmath8 emission and the low [ oiii]/h@xmath8 ratio , so for these positions in the galaxy we are justified to add the current burst of star formation , which occurs 3  gyr after the disc and bulge population was consolidated .",
    "figure  14 shows that a double burst model can reproduce the line indices observed throughout the nuclear ring of m100 ( for instance , a model with a 3  gyr delay and a relative second burst strength of 5 per cent : the yellow model in figure  14a ) .",
    "the location of the ring apertures compared to the model predictions further suggests the presence of an age gradient within the ring ( see section 6.6 ) .",
    "however , such a model is not too attractive because it implies that the nuclear ring has only ever had one starburst episode , which is the one we are witnessing at present .",
    "considering the proposed close dynamical connection between the ring and the long - lived bar , one would rather assume that the actively star - forming phase of the ring had been more extended .",
    "we thus enhance our model by adding additional bursts between the end of the past star formation event and the current burst .",
    "star formation must have stopped after the initial event to be followed only by episodic bursts , otherwise the h@xmath8 index would have become too high and the mg_b _ and fe5015 indices would have never increased to the observed values , as shown by the continuous star formation model of figure  12 . as star formation rates in nuclear rings are high ,",
    "it is likely that star formation will quickly use up available gas in the ring , until more gas is supplied to the bar , causing the pattern of star formation to be episodic rather than continuous .",
    "we tested this by starting out from the model with just the current burst of star formation , and observing the behaviour of the spectral indices as extra bursts were added one at a time .",
    "the results of this can be seen in fig .  15 for a time separation of 0.5  gyr between bursts , and in fig .  16 for a time separation of 0.1  gyr . as more bursts are added , the position of the line in fig .",
    "15 moves vertically upwards and slightly to the left after the first extra burst , then comes back down .",
    "regardless of the number of bursts , the spectral indices do not change significantly , as long as the time between the bursts is quite large ( @xmath540.5  gyr ) .",
    "but , importantly , fig .",
    "16 shows what happens if the time separation is decreased to 0.1  gyr , a number which is more plausible in a scenario of recurrent ring activity .",
    "the red line corresponds to the original model described above and shown in fig .",
    "as the number of bursts is increased , the modelled values move significantly to the left and up ( higher h@xmath8 and lower mgfe50 ) . due to the orbital movement of stars and gas around the ring , determining the number of bursts a particular star - forming clump has experienced",
    "will be impossible .",
    "additionally , the errors on the individual points do not allow us to be this specific about the exact number of bursts .",
    "figure  16 shows that the ring apertures can be matched by short time separation multi - burst models .",
    "although it appears from fig .",
    "16 that the variation in h@xmath8 values is due to varying numbers of bursts , the orbital movement of stars and gas around the ring will erase any signature of this in the integrated spectra .",
    "additionally , the errors on the individual points do not allow us to be this specific about the exact index values . from the multi - burst models ,",
    "it is evident that stellar age increases as one moves vertically and to the right in the index diagram , as was the case in the double burst models ( see section 6.6 ) .",

    "the two elements are created predominantly in supernovae of different types : fe in type ia and mg in type ii supernovae .",
    "type ia supernovae are due to the accretion of a binary companion onto a white dwarf - a relatively long process .",
    "type ii supernovae are produced from the core collapse of massive stars which have much shorter lifetimes .",
    "an overabundance of mg suggests that the population is dominated by massive stars , which can be the result of a flat imf , short timescales for star formation , or a low fraction of binaries experiencing type ia supernovae @xcite .",

    "the stars in the centre and along the bar all have mg / fe ratios which are too high , suggesting that the initial star formation event in the galaxy ( @xmath543  gyr ago ) occurred over short timescales , and most of the stars were formed before enough type 1a supernovae had enriched the ism with fe , which can take several gyr @xcite .",
    "the new stars forming in the nuclear ring do not have an over - abundance of mg , which makes sense as enough type 1a supernovae from the original burst should have occurred by now .",
    "this offers support for the assumption that the gas creating these new stars has been brought in from the disc under the influence of the bar .",

    "stars belonging to the bar follow highly elongated orbits aligned parallel to the bar , which leads to the observed non - circular motions as we see at a radial distance of @xmath55 arcsec from the nucleus .",

    "we confirm these motions in the gas , but also observe them clearly in the stellar velocity field .",
    "in fact , their radial position coincides with the region where our kinemetric analysis of the gas velocity field suggests a localised radial region of inflow - presumably due to material which flows through the spiral arm wave and in doing so moves to smaller radii .",

    "one similarity between various models of ring formation is the net inflow of gas into the ring near the contact points between the ring and the dust lanes . to investigate whether this inflow directly influences the massive star formation",
    ", we can measure ages for the brightest clumps in a nuclear ring to see whether there are any underlying azimuthal trends .",
    "ryder , knapen & takamiya ( 2001 ) carried out such a study of the nuclear ring in m100 , using ukirt nir spectroscopy , and discovered marginal evidence for a gradient in clump ages around the ring , with the youngest clumps found at the contact points .",
    "this would support a picture where the gas inflow near the contact points immediately causes gravitational collapse and massive star formation , rather than one in which the gas inflow gradually fills the ring with gas , and where massive star formation would then occur more stochastically around the ring .",

    "( 2006 ) investigate this across a sample of 22 nuclear rings and find that most follow the latter scenario , with a small minority of the rings showing evidence for significant azimuthal age gradients .",

    "the ew of the h@xmath8 emission of an ssp decreases extremely quickly and monotonically with time in the age range 2 to 6  myr ( e.g. leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ; terlevich et al . 2004 ) .",
    "because this basic behaviour is independent of metallicity and of the shape of the imf , we can use the ew as a sound relative age indicator , and do so for the emitting regions around the ring .",
    "we determine the h@xmath8 ew by measuring the flux of the h@xmath8 emission line , after correcting for the velocity dispersion and instrumental resolution .",
    "to estimate the continuum flux , we determine the median flux level across the complete spectral range from the emission corrected stellar spectra . dividing the flux of the line by this continuum level gives the ew of the line .",

    "figure  21 indicates that the highest ews , thus youngest ages , occur near two positions along the ring , @xmath57 apart .",
    "ews between these two positions are lower , indicating older ages , while the western apertures , between pa@xmath58 and @xmath59 , show a monotonically decreasing set of ew values .    figure  22 plots , for the same apertures within the ring , the h@xmath8 against mgfe50 absorption line strengths .",
    "although it is impossible to give exact ages for each clump due to the uncertainties in the star formation history , a vertical sequence in colours is prominent , with red and orange points at the bottom of the plot , and green and blue colours towards the top .",
    "relating to the ages given by the model , this sequence is readily interpreted as the same bipolar age sequence as seen in ew ( younger to older from bottom to top ) .",
    "the red and orange points indicate an age of around 10 - 30  myr , and the green and blue points around 30 - 50  myr .",
    "the absolute ages of these stars are of course model dependent , but the differences between ages are significant .    using two independent methods we have therefore found convincing and consistent evidence for the presence of a bipolar age gradient in the nuclear ring of m100 , with the youngest stars located near the contact points , where the gas flowing from the disc and through the bar ( paper i ) reaches the ring .",

    "the different parts of this comparison have been described in detail in the preceding sections , but we aim to summarise the results here and place them into the context of our understanding of the bar and the nuclear ring which it fuels .",
    "the main premise of this understanding is that the asymmetric potential outlined by the bar extracts angular momentum from the gas , which flows inwards as a result ( prendergast 1983 ; athanassoula 1992 ; shlosman , begelman & frank 1990 ) .",
    "the inflow of gas slows down in the vicinity of a pair of ilrs , and between them , near the inner ilr , massive star formation occurs as a result of the gravitational collapse of accumulated gas , and does so in a ring - like region which we observe as the nuclear ring .",

    "the current paper attempts to use both new kinematic and morphological measurements , and the strengths of emission and absorption line features due to stars and gas , to further elucidate the history of star formation within the bar and nuclear ring region in m100 .",
    "the absorption line indices of h@xmath8 and mgfe50 , first of all , show how the light from the nucleus of m100 and from its bar can be described simply by an old stellar population , whose age we estimate to be around 3  gyr ( figure  12 ) .",
    "we thus confirm that the bar and the nucleus ( bulge ) are formed by old stars , as expected , and as confirmed in , e.g. , the _ sst _ 3.6 and 4.5@xmath19 m maps ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the light from the nuclear ring , however , can not be described by any single past star formation event , nor by continuous star formation ( figure  12 ) . for the ring ,",
    "we thus develop alternative models , and find that the only way to reproduce the observed intermediate values of mgfe50 in combination with low h@xmath8 is to introduce a past star formation event which stopped around 3  gyr ago ( where this figure is given by the age of the stars in the bar and nucleus ) .",
    "we can not constrain the form of that event , whether it was one or several discreet bursts or a more continuous star formation , because each of these scenarios would by now have led to an identical old population , but the line index measurements in the ring do dictate an end to this episode of disc and bulge formation roughly at the time stated above .",
    "in addition , our model invokes recent and current star formation in the ring , which we of course know must exist to give the observed massive star formation rate .",
    "we can reproduce the observed line indices by a combination of the past event and one current burst of star formation ( fig .",
    "14 ) , but this particular model has the conceptual disadvantage that the ring would have been quiescent from 3  gyr ago to very recently , which is at odds with the scenario in which the ( long - lived and old ) bar continuously feeds the ring with gas .    our preferred model , then , reproduces the observed line indices by combining our past star formation event with a number ( around five , say ) of discreet but rapidly repetitive bursts , separated by , say , 100  myr .",
    "in addition , our line indices and , independently , h@xmath8 emission ew measurements show how the ages of the individual star - forming regions vary systematically azimuthally around the ring , with the youngest regions lying near the contact points where the dust lanes connect the bar and ring ( discussed in more detail in sect .  6.2 ) .",
    "given the nature of our data and the time - behaviour of line indices in such complex populations , we can not constrain the parameters describing this series of bursts to high precision : for instance , five bursts of a certain intensity give the same line indices as six with slightly lower intensity . but",
    "the model we present here is entirely plausible , because it represents the star - forming nuclear ring as an entity that is regularly undergoing massive starbursts , and has done so during a period of time of order @xmath62yr .",
    "this timescale connects in a consistent manner the presence of a bar , which is presumably stable and long - lived ( e.g. , jogee et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the nuclear ring , whose timescales for both formation and , once formed , stability are entirely consistent with the modelling performed by k95a .",
    "linear instability analysis ( elmegreen 1994 ) also suggests a timescale of @xmath5410@xmath63  yrs for the lifetime of star formation in a nuclear ring .",
    "we thus confirm that nuclear rings are a stable configuration in which a bar feeds the ring with relatively cool gas flowing in from the disc , and in which the ring itself can host a number of consecutive massive star formation events .",

    "this conclusion was reached originally because the two bars have the same pa and a very similar radial ellipticity behaviour , and on the basis of the overall morphology of stars and dust lanes .",
    "the morphology of the inner part of the bar is severely distorted by the combined influence of dust extinction and emission by young stars , and this is even the case at 2.2@xmath19 m ( see k95a for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "we can now use the irac images to revisit this issue , and for this purpose have run the ellipse fitting task in iraf s stsdas on the 3.6@xmath19 m image .",
    "we were able to fit the radial runs of the surface brightness @xmath19 , the pa of the major axis , and the ellipticity across the complete range in radius from the inner resolution limit near 2  arcsec to well into the optical disc , although the fits are less well constrained at the outer limits .",
    "the resulting fits , shown in fig .",
    "23 , clearly confirm the results obtained in k95a on the basis of a @xmath65-band image of the inner part of the bar and an @xmath66-band image of the disc .",
    "the main characteristics are the two parts of the bar , defined by a very clear rise and fall of the ellipticity , in both cases from the disc value of 0.14 ( corresponding to the inclination angle of the disc of 30@xmath20 ) to a maximum value of @xmath67 , which occurs at radii of @xmath68 and @xmath69arcsec for the inner and outer parts of the bar , respectively .",
    "the pa is stable and identical ( at a value of pa=107@xmath503degrees ) at the location of both these peaks in ellipticity , but is higher in the region between them .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile shows the locations of both parts of the bar , but a detailed discussion of these and other features of this profile is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we performed a bulge / disc decomposition on the 3.6@xmath19 m surface brightness profile , the results of which are shown in fig .  23 .",
    "the bulge fit yields an exponential scale length of 4.5arcsec , whereas the disc yields 65.6arcsec .",
    "this latter value is not very different from the values given by beckman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who report scale lengths between 67.5 and 76.4arcsec for different optical wavebands ( albeit determined over a larger radial than our 3.6@xmath19 m value ) .",
    "the fact that the scale lengths do not vary much , even going out to 3.6@xmath19 m , reinforces the conclusion by beckman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that the galaxy does not contain much dust , except in localized areas ( spiral arms ) .    in summary",
    ", we confirm the conclusion from k95a , but now on the basis of much better observational material , that the inner and outer parts of the bar of m100 , located inside and outside the star - forming nuclear ring , have identical ( within the error margins ) radial elliptical and pa profiles .",
    "the inner part of the bar is not visible in the sauron morphology maps , as it is primarily composed of older stars ( k95a ) .",
    "the influence of the bar can be seen in the stellar kinematics , as a small deviation near the minor axis .",
    "the stellar kinematics are derived from the stellar absorption features which contain a contribution from these older stars .",
    "the morphology of the nuclear ring changes dramatically with wavelength in the irac and 24@xmath19 m mips images considered here .",
    "whereas the inner part of the bar and the emission regions k1 and k2 at its ends dominate the 3.6@xmath19 m image , the star - forming ring becomes gradually more prominent with increasing wavelength , as seen clearly in the colour index maps ( fig .",
    "4 ) where the ring is consistently red .",
    "because the emission from the nucleus is diminishing with increasing wavelength , the 8@xmath19 m image almost exclusively shows the ring , in which k1 and k2 are especially prominent .",
    "we interpret the tadpole shape of these regions as due to the emission from the well - known miniature spiral arm fragments due north and south of the nucleus , and labelled h@xmath73 and h@xmath74 in k95a ( see fig .",
    "comparison with the 24@xmath19 m image , at much lower spatial resolution , shows that the northern spiral armlet , h@xmath74 , is a much more active star - forming region than its southern counterpart h@xmath73 .",
    "this is consistent with , but could not reliably have been deduced from , the other data : for instance , k95b found that h@xmath74 was not only a bit brighter , but also somewhat dustier than ha3 , and the 8@xmath19 m image also shows more emission from h@xmath74 than h@xmath73 .",
    "the emission from the nucleus dominates at the shorter irac wavelengths , and emission from the two symmetrically placed regions at the ends of the inner part of the bar is equally strong in the western ( called k1 in k95a ) and the eastern ( k2 ) sites .",
    "these were described by k95a to be symmetric regions of star formation , where k2 was postulated to be more obscured by dust than k1 .",
    "the ages of k1 and k2 are similar , between 15 and 25  myr , as modelled on the basis of @xmath70 imaging ( k95a ) and near - ir spectroscopy ( ryder & knapen 1999 ) .",
    "the ages derived from the absorption line indices from the sauron data are model dependent , but k1 and k2 are found to have similar h@xmath8 absorption indices ( indicating similar ages ) .",
    "the _ sst _ imaging confirms that k1 and k2 are intrinsically very similar . by measuring the flux within two matched apertures of 2.4 arcsec in diameter centred on k1 and k2 , we find that indeed the flux ratio k2/k1 is close to unity . the ratios ( k2/k1 flux ) measured in this way are 0.88 for h@xmath8 ( using the sauron data ) , 1.13 for h@xmath7 , 0.95 at @xmath65 ( using images from k95a for h@xmath7 and @xmath65 ) , 0.97 at 3.6@xmath19 m , 1.05 at 4.5 and 5.8 , 1.09 at 8.0 , and finally 1.29 at 24@xmath19 m .",
    "these ratios are consistent with k2 being more dusty than k1 , and in fact the ratios at h@xmath7 and h@xmath8 allow an estimate of dust extinction a factor of 1.2 higher at k2 than at k1 .",
    "k2 is forming more stars than k1 , as indicated by the most direct sf tracer , the 24@xmath19 m image ( calzetti et al . 2005 ) , and as corroborated by the high h@xmath7 k2/k1 ratio .",
    "the slow increase in the k2/k1 flux ratio from 2.2 to 8@xmath19 m is consistent with this picture .",
    "we should point out that we did not attempt to subtract the underlying emission from disc , bulge , and nuclear ring from the fluxes at k2 and k1 .",
    "this paper presents sauron integral field observations of the central region and bar of m100 , which yields the gaseous and stellar kinematics , and emission and absorption line strength maps .",
    "we complement this data set with _ sst _",
    "near- and mid - ir imaging of m100 .",
    "the basic emission line morphology is that of the well - known nuclear ring which shines brightly in h@xmath8 , and which is linked to hii regions at the eastern end of the bar by a thin arc of ionised gas , running alongside but offset from the dust lanes ( see also paper  i ) . in [ oiii ]",
    "the morphology shows a central peak , while generally tracing the h@xmath8 emission .",
    "the h@xmath8 and [ oiii ] gas kinematics show regular rotation along the bar , equivalent to an inclined rotating disc , but with characteristic kinks in the velocity field along the bar minor axis , near the radius of the nuclear ring .",
    "the stellar velocity field is similar to that of the gas in the bar , and the non - circular motions are only slightly less evident near the centre , and practically as strong as in the gas along the bar minor axis . as discussed in more detail in paper  i , the h@xmath8 gas velocity dispersion shows a lower value where the star formation occurs , in the ring and at the ends of the bar , and also alongside the eastern dust lane .",
    "the [ oiii ] gas velocity dispersion shows a slight decrease in the ring , and has a much higher central value than h@xmath8 .    the mg_b _ and fe5015 absorption line indices show lower values within the ring suggesting that a younger stellar population is diluting the deep absorption features of the older bulge population .",
    "the h@xmath8 absorption line index shows a broken ring , with the breaks occurring where the h@xmath8 emission is the strongest .",
    "all three absorption line indices , as well as the h@xmath8 ew , show that the youngest stellar populations are found at the contact points between the ring and the dust lanes .",
    "detailed modelling of the line strengths shows that old stars are present in addition to the young population which dominates the appearance of the ring , mostly so in emission lines like that of h@xmath8 .",
    "these old stars must have been formed in a past star formation event which produced the bulk of the mass , and which stopped some 3  gyr ago , a constraint set by the age of the stars in the bar and the nucleus .",
    "our best - fitting model is one in which the current star formation is but the latest of a series of relatively short bursts of star formation which have occurred for the last 500  myr or so .",
    "a clear bi - polar azimuthal age gradient is seen within the ring , with the youngest stars occurring near where the bar dust lanes connect with the ring .",
    "our kinematic and morphological results thus confirm a picture in which the nuclear ring in m100 , considered typical , is fed by gas flowing in from the disc under the action of the bar , is slowed down near a pair of resonances , and forms significant amounts of massive stars .",
    "detailed stellar population modelling shows how the underlying bulge and disc were put in place a number of gyr ago , and that the nuclear ring has been forming stars since about 500  myr ago in a stable succession of bursts .",
    "this confirms that nuclear rings can form under the influence of a resonant structure set up by a bar , and proves that they are stable features of a galaxy rather than one - off starburst events .",
