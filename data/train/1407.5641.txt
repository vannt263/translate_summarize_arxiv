    "during the last decade many experimental  and theoretical works were devoted to study the energy lost by atomic projectiles after grazingly colliding  with crystal surfaces under axial surface channeling conditions , i.e. impinging along low indexed crystallographic directions robin0305,garcia06,valdes08,chen11 .",
    "recently the subject has attracted renewed attention as a consequence of the experimental observation of fast atom diffraction ( fad ) from crystal surfaces @xcite , where energy loss processes are considered to play an important role against quantum coherence @xcite . at present fad phenomena",
    "have been observed for a wide variety of materials , including insulators schuller07,rousseau07 , metals @xcite and semi - conductors @xcite , as well as adsorbate covered metal surfaces @xcite and ultrathin films @xcite and organic molecules @xcite on metal substrates . in all these cases",
    "the preservation of the quantum coherence becomes a crucial factor for the observation of the diffraction patterns .",
    "since the energy transfer from the projectile to the surface is considered a relevant source of decoherence in fad , in recent articles @xcite the energy lost by fast h and he atoms scattered from a lif(@xmath3 ) surface under axial surface channeling conditions was experimentally investigated by recording the angular distribution of scattered projectiles in coincidence with their energy loss . for h projectiles it was found that inelastic electronic processes are responsible for the diffuse background present in experimental fad spectra , while for he impact contributions of surface electronic excitations were found to be significantly smaller , strongly reducing the presence of the inelastic background in the corresponding angular distributions . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite trajectory - dependent energy loss for he atoms grazingly colliding with a lif(@xmath3 ) surface along low indexed directions was experimentally and theoretically studied  considering a perpendicular energy , associated with the motion normal to the surface plane , higher than the perpendicular energy range for fad .    since for metals  the absence of an energy threshold for electronic excitations favors the projectile energy dissipation , in this article we study the energy loss distribution for swift he atoms impinging on a metal surface - ag(@xmath4 )  - under the same conditions for which fad patterns have been reported @xcite . precisely , this collision system corresponds to the first and simplest metallic case for which fad effects were experimentally observed , in conjunction with measurable energy losses @xcite .",
    "the projectile energy loss due to electronic transitions from the metal  surface is here described by means of a semi - classical formalism that takes into account the energy dissipation along different classical paths without including effects of quantum coherence .",
    "the influence of quantum interferences in the projectile energy - loss  spectrum is expected to be minor because even for insulator surfaces , where valence electrons are tighter than in metals , coherence quantum effects are completely washed out when partial contributions coming from different initial crystal states are added to obtain the transition probability to a given final state @xcite .    to evaluate the energy lost by axially channeled he atoms we introduce a friction force in  newton 's equations for the projectile trajectory .",
    "the friction force is expressed in terms of the transport cross section at the fermi level , corresponding to the screened potential of the atom embedded in an electron gas juaristi08 . at each point of the trajectory we use a local electronic density that is evaluated from an accurate density - functional theory ( dft ) calculation .",
    "both the potential  for he - ag(@xmath4 ) and the surface electronic density are evaluated on equal footing , i.e. from dft calculations within the same conditions .",
    "the projectile - surface interaction is represented by a potential energy surface ( pes ) that was built from a large set  of _ ab initio _ data obtained with the dft - based quantum espresso  code giannozzi09 , combined with a sophisticated interpolation technique crp . from such _ ab initio _ values we derived a three - dimensional ( 3d ) pes , taking into account the projectile s three degrees of freedom .",
    "no average of the surface potential nor the electronic density along the incidence direction was considered in the calculation . in ref .",
    "rubiano13 the quality of such a pes  was tested by means of fad patterns for perpendicular energies in the range @xmath5 ev- @xmath6 ev .    double differential - angle and energy - loss resolved - probabilities for he atoms scattered along three different crystallographic directions - @xmath7 $ ] , @xmath1 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] - are analyzed , considering different incidence energies and angles . the work is organized as follows .",

    "the final projectile distribution originated by inelastic collisions with the surface is derived from classical trajectory calculations by including the energy lost by the atom along the classical path . for grazing incidence of he atoms with energies in the few kev range ,",
    "electron - hole pair excitations represent the main mechanism of projectile energy loss , while contributions of nuclear scattering are expected to be negligible robin01,lederer07 . due to the fact that in a metal there is no minimum energy required to excite electron ",
    "hole pairs , for atoms moving with velocities lower than the fermi velocity of the metal , the electronic stopping power , i.e. the energy lost per unit path length , has a linear dependence on velocity @xcite .",
    "then , the dissipative force experienced by the moving atom can be expressed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a friction coefficient and @xmath11 is * *  * * the velocity of the atom . here",
    "the coefficient @xmath10 is calculated within the local density friction approximation  ( ldfa ) juaristi08 .",
    "this model has been successfully applied to study dissipative effects of atoms and molecules interacting with different metal surfaces @xcite .    within the ldfa the modulus of the dissipative force acting on the projectile is calculated in terms of the transport cross section at the fermi level @xmath12 as @xcite : @xmath13where @xmath14 is the electron gas density and @xmath15 is the corresponding fermi momentum . at each position",
    "@xmath16 along the classical trajectory the electron gas density @xmath14 is approximated by the local electronic density @xmath17 , which is evaluated from _ ab _ _ initio _ calculations and within the same conditions as the pes .",
    "then , the friction coefficient @xmath18 is expressed in terms of the transport cross section at the fermi level associated with the electron scattering at the potential induced by the he projectile in the electron gas @xcite .",
    "such a potential is evaluated using dft @xcite . in this way , the model includes nonlinear effects both in the medium response to the atomic potential ( nonlinear screening ) and in the calculation of the relevant cross - sections for the energy loss process .",
    "the classical trajectory of the projectile is obtained by solving newton 's equations @xcite :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the projectile mass and @xmath21 is the projectile - surface potential . the first term on the right side of eq .",

    "( [ newton ] ) for different initial positions on the surface plane , the final projectile distribution @xmath22 is obtained by counting the number of classical paths ending with final momentum @xmath23  in the direction of the solid angle @xmath24 and final energy @xmath25 ,  where @xmath26 and @xmath27  are the final polar and azimuthal angles , respectively , with @xmath27 measured with respect to the incidence direction in the surface plane .",
    "the interaction energy of the he atom with the ag(@xmath4 ) surface is described with a full adiabatic 3d pes that depends on the atomic position @xmath28 .",
    "the pes is constructed by interpolating @xcite over a grid of _ ab initio _",
    "energies for 42 equidistant points @xmath29 , ranging from the asymptotic region to 2 a.u . below the topmost atomic layer , and",
    "6 @xmath30 sites uniformly spread on the surface unit cell . all _ ab initio _ data are obtained from the dft - based quantum espresso  code  @xcite .",
    "details regarding the pes calculation can be found in ref .",
    "in this work we extend a previous study @xcite to investigate the energy lost by @xmath31he atoms grazingly colliding with ag(@xmath4 )  along the @xmath2 $ ] , @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] channels .",

    "the energy - loss distribution @xmath46 , as a function of the lost energy @xmath47",
    "@xmath48 @xmath42 , is straightforwardly derived from @xmath49  by integrating on the solid angle @xmath50 .",

    "2 we show @xmath46 for @xmath53 kev and @xmath54 ( that is , @xmath55 ev ) considering the incidence directions @xmath2 $ ] , @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "these energy - loss distributions , obtained without including the experimental spread of the incident beam in the calculations , present well defined structures with multiple peaks ,  resembling the energy - loss spectra reported in ref . moix10 .",
    "in order to identify the origin of these peaks , labeled with letters a , b , and c in figs .",
    "2 a ) , b ) and c ) respectively , representative trajectories contributing to them are plotted in fig .",
    "3 . for the three incidence directions",
    "we find that every energy - loss peak is related to a defined set of projectile trajectories .",
    "for incidence along the channel @xmath0 $ ] ( fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ) the peak a@xmath56 , which presents the highest intensity , is associated with trajectories that suffer strong azimuthal deviations with respect to the incidence direction , corresponding to classical rainbow scattering . such paths probe regions with low electron density , producing the lowest energy loss of the spectrum . instead ,",
    "the trajectories that contribute to the peak a@xmath57 correspond to he atoms that move over the rows of topmost ag atoms that form the channel , suffering almost no deviation .",
    "even though these projectiles are the ones that least approach the surface as they do not enter the channel , they probe the region with the highest electron density , thus suffering the highest energy loss .",
    "lastly , two different kind of trajectories contribute to the peak a@xmath58 : one of them running parallel to the channel in the middle position between rows and the other running far away from the surface plane and suffering an azimuthal deflection .    a similar structure , with three peaks ,",
    "is observed for incidence along the @xmath59 $ ] channel ( fig . 2 ( c ) ) , but in this case , the peak c@xmath58 is the one associated with rainbow scattering , while the peaks c@xmath56 and c@xmath57 are related to he atoms that move in the middle or on top of the channel rows , respectively . on the other hand , the energy - loss distribution for incidence along the @xmath1 $ ] channel ( fig .",
    "2 ( b ) ) displays a completely different structure , with only two peaks - b@xmath56 and b@xmath58  - at the extremes of the distribution .",
    "these peaks are associated with projectiles running in the middle of the channel or over the rows of topmost surface atoms , respectively .",
    "we have thus found that it is the dependence of energy loss on the kind of he trajectory that determines the multiple - peak structure in energy - loss distributions for mono - energetic incident beams ( named here primary distributions ) .",
    "this result could be used to study the effective corrugation of the surface electronic density .",
    "however , the experimental determination of these primary energy - loss spectra would require an energy resolution better than one ev , which is not yet reachable with present experimental capabilities .    with the aim of comparing the energy - loss spectra with available experimental data @xcite , in fig .",
    "4 we plot  the energy - loss distribution obtained by including the energy profile of the experimental incident beam through convolution @xcite .",
    "two different initial conditions are considered : ( a ) @xmath60 kev , @xmath61 ( i.e. @xmath62 ev ) and ( b ) @xmath53 kev , @xmath63 ( i.e. @xmath55 ev ) . in both cases ,",
    "when the experimental energy dispersion is introduced in the calculation we obtain a smooth energy - loss curve , without any signature of the primary - energy loss structure . for @xmath60",
    "kev the experimental curve is fairly well reproduced by the simulation , but the agreement deteriorates when the energy increases and for @xmath53 kev  the maximum of the energy loss distribution overestimates the experimental value .",
    "primary distributions of fig . 2 present completely different shapes but , for incidence along the @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] channels they produce similar convoluted energy - loss spectra , with a mean energy loss slightly higher than the one obtained for the @xmath2 $ ] direction , as observed in fig .",
    "this last result is unexpected at first glance because the average electronic density probed by he atoms that move over the atomic rows of the @xmath64 $ ] channel is higher than the one corresponding to any of the other channels .",
    "however , since projectiles running along the @xmath1 $ ] or @xmath8 $ ] directions suffer a smaller friction in the incoming path than in the case of the @xmath2 $ ] direction , they can get closer to the surface thus loosing more energy in the whole trajectory .",
    "this interplay between the distance of maximum approach to the surface and the energy lost along the path is also observed for the different perpendicular energies considered in this work , as shown in fig .",
    "7 .    in relation to the angular distribution of inelastically",
    "scattered he atoms , in all the cases it shows the usual banana shape @xcite , with final polar and azimuthal angles lying inside a circular annulus , characteristic of the axial channeling conditions . due to the fact that in our model the friction force acts along the direction of the velocity , the energy loss affects mainly the component of the projectile velocity along the incidence channel",
    ". then , initial and final energies associated with the motion normal to the channel are very similar , almost strictly verifying @xmath65 .",
    "double differential probabilities , @xmath66 , as a function of the lost energy @xmath67 and the azimuthal angle @xmath27 , are displayed in fig .",
    "5 for the incidence conditions of fig .",
    "2 . for the three channels",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) angle- and energy - loss- resolved distributions present a double peak energy - loss structure for most angles , with sharp maxima at the outermost azimuthal angles , which are associated with classical rainbow dispersion .",
    "the shape of these  2d spectra strongly varies with the incidence direction , showing energy - loss peaks associated with rainbow scattering only for the @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] channels .",
    "notice that while energy - loss structures give information about the electronic density along the channel , the angular positions of rainbow peaks depend on the corrugation of the surface potential across the incidence direction @xcite .",
    "thus , experiments in coincidence , measuring simultaneously angular and energy - loss distributions with a certainly high energy resolution , might provide useful insights on the atom - surface interaction .    finally , to investigate the dependence of the energy - loss on @xmath68 , in fig .",
    "6 we display primary energy - loss distributions for @xmath69 kev he atoms , as a function of the normalized lost energy @xmath70 , where @xmath71 denotes the mean energy loss , considering different perpendicular energies . in the figure we have labeled as _ top _",
    ", _ middle _ and _ rb _ the peaks associated with trajectories running along top or middle - channel rows , or contributing to the rainbow angle , respectively .",
    "we found that the relative positions of the energy - loss peaks change with the perpendicular energy .",
    "such an energy displacement is more notorious for the directions @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] , which present a high corrugation of the electronic density along the channel .",
    "while for the @xmath2 $ ] direction  the type of trajectories contributing to each peak do not vary with @xmath68 in the considered range , for the other two directions _ top _ ( _ middle _ ) trajectories contribute to the region of low ( high ) or high ( low ) lost energies , depending on the perpendicular energy .",
    "this fact is again related to the strong corrugation of the electronic density along these channels .",
    "in addition , the mean energy loss for a given incidence direction , normalized with the impact energy @xmath72 , shows a linear behavior as a function of the perpendicular energy , increasing as @xmath68 augments , as observed in fig .",
    "in all the cases , mean energy loss values for the channels @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] are similar , being higher than the ones corresponding to the @xmath2 $ ] channel , as discussed above .",
    "we have studied the energy lost by helium atoms after grazingly colliding with a silver surface along low indexed crystallographic directions .",
    "the distribution of inelastically scattered atoms was obtained within a semi - classical formalism that incorporates a friction force in the classical dynamics equations allowing  for the calculation of the trajectory - dependent energy loss .",
    "for the @xmath2 $ ] , @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] channels we found that  energy - loss distributions corresponding to mono - energetic incidence beams display well defined structures , with several sharp maxima that are related to trajectories that probe regions with different densities and potential energies . however , these energy - loss structures are completely blurred out by the experimental spread of the incident beam , which produces a broad energy - loss distribution with only one maximum .",
    "even though these last distributions are in fairly good agreement with available experimental data @xcite , experiments in coincidence measuring simultaneously angle- and energy - loss- resolved spectra with a high energy resolution would be necessary to shed light on the findings of the present work .",
