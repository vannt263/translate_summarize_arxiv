    "the discovery of unusually luminous optical transients by modern supernova ( sn ) surveys has dramatically expanded the observational and physical parameter space of known sn types .",
    "the texas supernova search was a pioneer in this area , with one of the first searches of the local universe without a galaxy bias @xcite .",
    "this has been followed by deeper , wider surveys from the palomar transient factory ( ptf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the la silla quest survey @xcite , all of which have found unusually luminous transients which tend to be hosted in intrinsically faint galaxies .",
    "these super - luminous sne ( sl - sne ) show absolute magnitudes at maximum light of @xmath6 mag and total radiated energies of order @xmath2 erg .",
    "they are factors of 5 to 100 brighter than type ia sne or normal core - collapse events .",
    "@xcite proposed that three distinct physical groups of sl - sne have emerged .",
    "the first group which was recognised was the luminous type iin sne epitomised by sn 2006gy @xcite which show signs of strong circumstellar interaction .",
    "the second group includes type ic sne that have broad , bright lightcurves and the decay rates imply that they could be due to pair - instability explosions powered by large ejecta masses of ( 35 ) . to date",
    "only one object of this type ( sn 2007bi ) has been published and studied in detail @xcite .",
    "the third group was labelled by gal - yam ( 2012 ) as super - luminous type i supernovae , or `` slsn - i '' and the two earliest examples are scp-06f6 and sn 2005ap @xcite which are characterized at early times by a blue continuum and a distinctive `` w''-shaped spectral feature at @xmath74200   . in this paper",
    "we will call this type super - luminous supernovae of type ic ( or sl - sne ic ) , simply because they are type ic in the established supernova nomenclature and are extremely luminous .",
    "the existence of this class of sl - sne ic was firmly established when secure redshifts were determined with the identification of narrow mg  ii @xmath82796,2803 absorption from the host galaxies in the optical spectra of @xmath9 transients by @xcite .",
    "the spectra of four ptf transients , scp-06f6 and sn 2005ap were then all linked together with these redshifts establishing a common type @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the identification of host galaxy emission lines such as [ o  ii ] @xmath03727 , [ o  iii ] @xmath81959,5007 , h@xmath10 and h@xmath11 has confirmed the redshift derived from the mg  ii absorption in many sl - sne ic , such as in the case of sn 2010gx @xcite .",
    "these distances imply an incredible luminosity with @xmath12 and @xmath13band absolute magnitudes reaching about @xmath14 .",
    "this luminosity allowed these sne to be easily identified in the pan - starrs medium deep fields at @xmath15 @xcite and beyond @xcite .",
    "the typical spectroscopic signature of the class of sl - sne ic is a blue continuum with broad absorption lines of intermediate mass elements such as c , o , si , mg with velocities 10000  @xmath16  @xmath17  @xmath16  20000  .",
    "no clear evidence of h or he has been found so far in the spectra of sl - sne ic , whereas fe , mg and si lines are typically prominent after maximum .",
    "the study of the well sampled sn 2010gx @xcite showed an unexpected transformation from a sl - sn ic spectrum to that of a normal type ic sn .",
    "a similar transformation was also observed in the late - time spectrum of ptf09cnd @xcite , which evolved to become consistent with a slowly evolving type ic sn .",
    "the sl - sne ic discovered to date appear to be associated with faint and metal poor galaxies at redshifts ranging between @xmath18 ( typically @xmath19 mag , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the highest redshift sl - sne ic ( ps1 - 12bam , @xmath20 ) is in a galaxy which is more luminous and more massive than the lower redshift counterparts @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the metallicity of the faint host galaxy of sn 2010gx , from the detection of the auroral [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 line indicates a very low metallicity of 0.05  z@xmath21 @xcite .",

    "the enormous peak luminosity of sl - sne ic with radioactive decay would require several solar masses of .",
    "however , this is inconsistent with the width of the lightcurves as shown by @xcite .",
    "the lightcurves can not be reproduced with a physical model that has an ejecta mass significantly greater than the mass needed to power the peak . in the case of sn 2010gx",
    ", @xcite showed that the tail phase faded to levels which would imply an upper limit of around 0.4  of . among the scenarios proposed to explain the remarkable peak luminosity are the spin down of a rapidly rotating young magnetar @xcite , that provides an additional reservoir of energy for the sn @xcite ; the interaction of the sn ejecta with a massive ( 3 - 5 ) c / o - rich circumstellar medium ( csm , * ? ? ? * ) or with a dense wind @xcite ; or collisions between high velocity shells ejected by a pulsational pair instability , which would give rise to successive bright optical transients @xcite .",
    "one of these sne ( sn 2006 oz ) was discovered 29 days before peak luminosity and showed a flat plateau in the rest - frame nuv before its rise to maximum , indicating that finding these objects early could give constraints on the explosion channel @xcite .",
    "in most cases to date however , the lightcurves and energy released at @xmath22100d is unexplored territory .",
    "@xcite quantified host of sn2010gx , but difference imaging showed no detection of sn flux at 250 - 300 days to deep limits .",
    "@xcite detected flux at the position of ptf09cnd at + 138d after peak in a b - band image , but it s not clear if this flux is from the host or the sn . in this paper we present the detailed follow - up of five sl - sne ic at @xmath23 , namely , , , and , and attempt to follow them for as long as possible to garner further evidence to probe the physical mechanism powering these intriguing events . a detailed analysis of their hosts will be part of a future paper ( chen et el . in prep ) .",

    "we have presented extensive photometric and spectroscopic coverage of five of the lowest redshift sl - sne ic . for one of them ,",
    ", we present a lightcurve from -30d to 200d , showing a well constrained rise time and a clear detection at 200d indicating a flattening of the luminosity . in four out of six sl - sne , we show that there is significant luminosity in this late tail phase , and we illustrate that these measurements can aid our understanding of the power source and the possible progenitors of these ultra luminous transients .    the five sne , namely , , , and have absolute magnitudes @xmath289(mag ) @xmath290 similar to previous sl - sne as well as a spectral evolution resembling sn 2010gx @xcite .",
    "there is some variation in the sample as two of the objects are fainter than the rest and spectroscopically evolve faster . and have peak absolute magnitudes fainter than @xmath291 mag .",
    "the spectra of evolves faster than the rest and at 10d post maximum it resembles a normal type ic at peak .",
    "in contrast , sn 2010gx and three other sne presented here typically take 30 days to evolve to this phase .",
    "the latest spectrum we have of shows well developed lines of fe  ii at velocities which are more comparable with standard type ic sne , significantly slower than the bulk of the sl - sne ic sample .",
    "our _ xshooter _ spectrum of + 52d is the only nir spectrum of an sl - sne ic and we detect a broad he  i @xmath010830 in emission implying that at least some sl - sne ic are not completely he - free . during the epochs of @xmath149 d around peak the temperatures and velocities are nearly constant and do not show a clear decrease until after that period .",
    "we find that the decay timescale in the 100 - 200d period is similar to that expected from the radioactive decay of , but it requires the @xmath169-rays to be fully trapped .",
    "this is in contrast to the faster decline observed in most type ib / c sne , where @xmath169-ray leakage has a significant effect from 50 days onwards @xcite .",
    "hence it is unlikely that this is due to large amounts ( 1 - 4  ) of produced in the explosion .",
    "we applied a semi - analytical diffusion model with energy input from a spinning down magnetar to fit the lightcurves of our five objects and sn 2010gx , including the diffusion peak and the tail phase detections .",
    "all lightcurves , including the tail phases are reproduced with feasible physical values for a magnetar .",
    "powered sl - sn .",
    "we require @xmath292 @xmath293 , @xmath294@xmath295 consistent with @xmath121 of known galactic magnetars ( @xmath296 ) and with physically plausible periods ( @xmath297 ) .",
    "we derived energies of @xmath298(@xmath2 erg ) @xmath3 and ejected masses of @xmath299()@xmath5 .",
    "the well sampled data of the five sl - sne ic presented here combined with those of sn 2010gx point toward a sn explosion driven by a magnetar as a viable explanation for all the sl - sne ic .",
    "the lightcurves are reproduced and the model temperatures and velocities are in reasonable agreement with the observational data .",
    "however even if this is a reliable model , it still leaves other open questions such as    * do h - rich sne powered by magnetars exist ?",
    "possibly sn 2008es @xcite could be an example of such a luminous type ii sn .",
    "in other words , why do we observe so many more h - free than h - rich sl - sne ? * what is the role of metallicity in the progenitor stars evolution that will produce a h - free sl - sne ?",
    "it appears that they are all associated with faint dwarf galaxies and almost certainly low metallicity progenitors .",
    "* do realistic spectral calculations of magnetar driven sn reproduce the main observed features at late time ?",
    "* where is the peak of the magnetar sed and how does the magnetar radiation deposit and thermalize in the nebular phase ?    to address these , further observations are required combined with modelling .",
    "theoretical modelling of high quality data in the nebular phase to determine the ejecta masses , composition and the mass of contributing to the luminosity seems the most likely way to make progress .",
    "optical spectroscopy at @xmath7300d post explosion appears to us to be the next step in probing the nature of these events . at @xmath300 ,",
    "the typical ab magnitudes of these sources are @xmath301 , requiring approximately 1 night of 8 m telescope time to gather a spectrum with high enough signal - to - noise to measure the expected ic - like emission lines with confidence .",
    "we thank dan kasen for providing us with the data of the simulations of @xcite in order to compare them with the output of our code .",
