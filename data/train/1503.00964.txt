    "in the theoretical study of polymer physics  @xcite , computer simulations provide a powerful method to mimic the behavior of polymers covering the range from atomic to coarse - grained scales depending on the problems one is interested in  @xcite .",
    "the generic scaling properties of single linear and branched polymers in the bulk under various solvent conditions and polymer solutions at different temperatures have been described quite well by simple coarse - grained lattice models , e.g. self - avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice , and off - lattice models , e.g. bead - spring model , etc .",
    "a wide variety of computational strategies has been employed to simulate and analyze these models , including conventional ( metropolis ) monte carlo ( mc ) schemes with various types of moves , chain growth algorithms , parallel tempering , and molecular dynamics  @xcite . on the one hand , however , as the size and complexity of a system increases , detailed information at the atomic scale may be lost when employing low resolution coarse - graining representations . on the other hand",
    ", the cost of computing time may be too high if the system is described at high resolution .",
    "therefore , more scientific effort has been devoted to developing an appropriate coarse - grained model where the connection to the details on the atomic scale is not lost , but rather atomistic details are suitably mapped on effective potentials on the coarser scale .",
    "such models then can reproduce the global thermodynamic properties and the local mechanical and chemical properties such as the intermolecular forces between polymer chains  @xcite .",
    "improving such approach further is still an active area of research .    in this work",
    "we deal with linear polymer chains in a melt on the simple cubic lattice .",
    "although coarse - grained lattice models neglect the chemical detail of a specific polymer chain and only keep chain connectivity ( topology ) and excluded volume , the universal behavior of polymers still remains the same in the thermodynamic limit ( as the chain length @xmath2)@xcite .",
    "we consider for our simulations the bond fluctuation model ( bfm )  @xcite where linear chains are located on the simple cubic lattice with bond constraints .",
    "the bfm has the advantages that the computational efficiency of lattice models is kept and the behavior of polymers in a continuum space can be described approximately .",
    "the model thus introduces some local conformational flexibility while retaining the computational efficiency of lattice models for implementing excluded volume interactions by enforcing a single occupation of each lattice vertex .",
    "although much work using this model exists already , only the fully flexible limit of the model has been used exclusively .",
    "this limit does not suffice when one considers a possible mapping of atomistic details to this model , which requires to include some description of chain stiffness as well .",
    "a review of recent bfm studies is given in ref .",
    "when the concentration of polymer solutions is above the overlap concentration denoted by @xmath3 , the excluded volume interactions are screened  @xcite .",
    "the average interaction between monomers finally should cancel in a polymer melt since every monomer is isotropically surrounded by other monomers belonging to the same chain or not according to flory s argument .",
    "therefore the polymer chains in a melt behave as ideal chains , where the excluded volume effect is no longer important .",
    "however , a careful investigation of an individual polymer chain in a polymer melt based on the bfm and the bead - spring model ( bsm ) shows that there are noticeable deviations from an ideal chain behavior  @xcite .",
    "the deviations are due to the incompressibility constraint of the melt",
    ". therefore , small scale - free corrections to the asymptotic behavior for ideal chains exist and they are irrespective of the stiffness of the chains . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors have shown that the corrections must decay as the dimensionless ( ginzburg ) parameter @xmath4 for @xmath5 with the increase of the segments @xmath6 and the effective bond length @xmath7 of the chain . here",
    "@xmath8 is the overall monomer density and @xmath9 the segmental overlap density related to the internal distance @xmath10 .",
    "it is still unclear whether the predicted power - law deviations from unperturbed gaussian behavior can be observed for the internal segment lengths of semiflexible chains in the range @xmath11 by varying the stiffness of chains , i.e. tuning the bending energy @xmath12 .",
    "a very important practical problem for the simulation of melts of very long polymer chains is the construction of a suitable initial configuration .",
    "a naive approach for creating initial configurations of melts with long polymers , would be to switch off initially the excluded volume interactions between monomers ( so that the polymers resemble gaussian chains ) , arrange these chains randomly in a simulation box , and switch on gradually the excluded volume interactions at the final step .",
    "it has been demonstrated by simulations using the bsm in the continuum that this strategy is not feasible since it leads to chain deformations on short length scales  @xcite . with increasing chain length this effect",
    "becomes more pronounced due to the fact that self - screening and correlation hole effects , inherent to flexible high polymer melts , are not properly accounted for by this procedure .",
    "this problem was overcome by reducing the density fluctuations of gaussian chains via a ",
    "pre - packing \" strategy , and then switching on the excluded volume interactions in a quasi - static way ( `` slow push - off '' )  @xcite .",
    "we test a similar strategy of simulating polymer melts based on the lattice model bfm in this work to check whether it helps to generate nearly equilibrated initial configurations through such a procedure .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : sec .",
    "[ model ] describes the model and the simulation technique discussing how to generate initial configurations of polymer chains in a melt to equilibrate the system .",
    "[ results ] presents the simulation results at different stages from the initial state to the equilibrium state of fully flexible and moderately stiff polymer chains in a melt .",
    "finally our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in the standard bond fluctuation model ( bfm )  @xcite a flexible polymer chain with excluded volume interactions is described by a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) chain of effective monomers on a simple cubic lattice ( the lattice spacing is the unit of length ) .",
    "each effective monomer of such a saw chain blocks all eight corners of an elementary cube of the simple cubic lattice from further occupation .",
    "two successive monomers along a chain are connected by a bond vector @xmath13 which is taken from the set \\{@xmath14,@xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 } including also all permutations .",
    "the bond length @xmath20 is therefore in a range between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "there are in total @xmath23 bond vectors and @xmath24 different bond angles between two sequential bonds along a chain serving as candidates for building the conformational structure of polymers .    as the stiffness of the chains",
    "is considered , semiflexible chains of @xmath25 monomers in a melt thus are described by saw chains on the simple cubic lattice , with a bending potential @xmath26 where @xmath12 is the bending energy ( @xmath27 for ordinary saws ) , and @xmath28 is the bond angle between the @xmath29 bond vector and the @xmath30 bond vector along a chain .",
    "@xmath31 is of order unity throughout the whole paper . a systematical study of single semiflexible chains based on the bfm  @xcite shows that due to bond vector fluctuations and lattice artifacts the initial decay of the bond - bond orientational correlation function deviates from the simple exponential decay for @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , one should be careful of using the bfm for studying rather stiff chains as has already been pointed out also in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is well understood that linear polymers in a melt can be described by saw chains based on the bfm at a volume fraction @xmath33  @xcite . since in the bfm",
    ", each effective monomer occupies one unit cell , containing @xmath34 lattice sites , the monomer density is therefore defined as @xmath35 . a detailed description of how we prepare the initial configurations is given as follows : the initial configuration of polymer melts containing @xmath36 chains of @xmath25 monomers in a box of size @xmath37 with periodic boundary conditions in all three directions are generated in the following way :    * the linear dimension of a simple cubic lattice is set up as @xmath38 with volume fraction @xmath33 .",
    "* at the @xmath39 step the first @xmath36 monomers of the chains are randomly put on the lattice sites without double overlapping . it can be easily done by dividing the box into @xmath36 blocks and putting a single monomer in each block at a randomly chosen position inside the block . *",
    "polymer chains are built like non - reversal random walks ( nrrws ) by adding one monomer at each step until all @xmath36 chains reaching the required chain length @xmath40 .",
    "( we define here the chain length as the number of bonds along the contour of a chain .",
    "the contour length of the chain then is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the root - mean - square bond length ) .",
    "based on the bfm there are @xmath23 possibilities to place the next monomer for each chain at the @xmath43 step , but at the following steps only one of @xmath44 directions can be selected since an immediately reverse step is not allowed . at this stage ,",
    "the excluded volume effect is switched off completely and @xmath36 nrrws of @xmath45-steps in the simulation box are generated .",
    "+ if the stiffness of the chains is considered , the probability of placing the @xmath30 monomer connected to the @xmath29 monomer is proportional to @xmath46 . *",
    "finally the excluded volume interactions between monomers are considered by applying the local 26 and slithering - snake moves to relax the polymer chains and push off those monomers blocking the same lattice site until all chains satisfy self- and mutual - avoidance .",
    "steepest descent \" approach only works for lattice chains since excluded volume constraints can be checked very efficiently , but would not work for continuum chains .    due to the large local density fluctuations of randomly overlapping nrrw chains in a melt , a pre - packing procedure to reduce the chain deformations",
    "is also tested before the excluded volume interactions are switched on .",
    "this pre - packing procedure has been successfully performed in the simulations of equilibrating very long polymer chains in melts up to @xmath47 and @xmath48 based on the bead - spring model in the continuum  @xcite . in this procedure",
    "all nrrw chains still keep their own structures as rigid bodies , but are rearranged by monte carlo ( mc ) trial moves .",
    "the cost function which describes the average fluctuations of the particle number @xmath49 within a sphere of radius @xmath50 with its center located at any monomer @xmath51 is defined by @xmath52 with @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total number of monomers in a melt , @xmath55 is the number of monomers inside the @xmath29 sphere of radius @xmath50 , @xmath56 is the distance between monomers @xmath51 and @xmath57 irrespective of the chain connectivity , and @xmath58 is the heaviside step function . a trial move is accepted if the cost function becomes smaller , namely , the local density fluctuation is minimized in this process .",
    "two types of mc moves , translation and pivot - like moves , applied to the center of mass of an individual chain are considered as follows : ( a ) in the translation move , an individual chain ( or its center of mass ) is randomly translated by a vector chosen from the set @xmath59 including all permutations .",
    "( b ) in the pivot - like move , a whole individual chain is transformed by randomly choosing one of the @xmath60 symmetric operators including rotations by @xmath61 or @xmath62 around a random axis and reflections through its center of mass , and inversion at its center of mass .",
    "the center of mass serves as a pivot point here .",
    "note that all monomers are only allowed to sit on the lattice sites , so a chain would need to be shifted slightly after the pivot - like move .",
    "however , the deviation of its center of mass is less than @xmath63 lattice spacing",
    ".    for equilibrating the system and measuring interesting physical quantities in the equilibrium runs three types of mc moves , local @xmath64 moves  @xcite , slithering - snake moves , and pivot moves , are used in our simulations and briefly described as follows ,    * local @xmath64 (  l26 \" ) move : a monomer is chosen randomly to move to one of the @xmath64 nearest and next nearest neighbor sites surrounding it , i.e , randomly translated by a vector chosen from the set @xmath59 including all permutations .",
    "the bond crossing is allowed during the move .",
    "this is different from the traditional local @xmath65 (  l6 \" ) move where a monomer of the chain is chosen at random and moved to the nearest neighbor sites in the six lattice directions randomly . *",
    "slithering - snake move : an end monomer is removed randomly and connected to the other end of the same linear chain by a bond vector randomly chosen from the set of @xmath23 allowed bond vectors . *",
    "pivot move : a monomer is chosen randomly from a linear chain as a pivot point , and the short part of the linear chain is transformed by randomly selecting one of the @xmath66 symmetry operations ( no change ; rotations by @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; reflections and inversions ) .    of course ,",
    "any attempted monte carlo move is accepted only if it does not violate constraints of our physical systems , such as excluded volume and bond length constraints .",
    "we first wish to test whether applying the pre - packing process to rearrange the nrrw chains based on the bfm before the excluded volume interaction is switched on helps to prepare the nearly equilibrated initial configurations or not .",
    "we restrict the size of the lattice to be @xmath67 in our simulations .",
    "the total number of effective monomers based on the bfm is therefore @xmath68 .",
    "varying @xmath36 and @xmath25 but keeping @xmath69 fixed the conformational properties of polymer melts including fully flexible chains ( @xmath70 ) and moderately stiff chains ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ) are studied .",
    "results of simulating polymer melts from preparing the initial configuration to the analysis of equilibrated chain structures in a melt are discussed in the next subsection iii a.       for @xmath74 .",

    "the estimates of the collective structure factor @xmath81 for @xmath82 and the local density fluctuation @xmath77 for @xmath74 are of the same order of magnitude ( see sec .  [ structure ] ) from the final configurations generated by this two - step pre - packing process .",

    "( a ) ( b ) + ( c ) ( d ) +    it is interesting to know what we have gained by introducing the pre - packing procedure before equilibrating the system",
    ". therefore , we check the process of pushing away the monomers occupying the same unit cells ( eight lattice sites are occupied by one effective monomer in bfm ) by observing the time series of the number of overlapping monomers , @xmath85 , as the excluded volume effect is switched on . for simplicity ,",
    "if a lattice site is occupied by @xmath6 effective monomers , it contributes @xmath86 overlapping monomers to @xmath85 .",

    "two sets of data ( @xmath34 samples for each ) representing the push - off process before ( dashed curve in green color online ) and after ( solid curves in red color online ) the pre - packing process is applied .",
    "here one mc step is a sequence of @xmath69 l26 moves , and @xmath87 slithering - snake moves . in the slithering - snake moves , an end - monomer of each chain",
    "is selected and attempted to move once until all chains have been chosen , and then the same procedure is repeated @xmath25 times .",
    "a trial move is accepted if @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a random number and @xmath91 .",
    "the latter condition is the metropolis criterion preserving the stiffness of the chains .",
    "if only l26 moves are applied in this push - off process , at the beginning it is very efficient to push off overlapping monomers , but then some chains are trapped in a state containing knots , or a state blocked by other chains .",
    "the slithering - snake moves therefore indeed play an important role at the intermediate stages for the chains escaping from a trapped state . from our observations in fig .",
    "[ fig - melt - overlap ] it seems that applying an additional pre - packing process does not speed up the push - off process .",
    "however , it is still necessary to investigate the conformation of chains in a melt carefully .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to note that pre - packing leads to a significantly faster decrease of @xmath85 with time during intermediate stages of the process .",
    "this feature may be of interest in cases where one does not require that strictly @xmath92 in the initial stage of the averaging .",
    "consider e.g. a variant of the model where monomers overlap is not strictly forbidden ( which corresponds to an infinitely high repulsive energy ) but only leads to a large but finite energy penalty , e.g. @xmath93 .",
    "the probability to accept a move which increases the overlap then is of order @xmath94 , i.e. essentially negligible , and for long chains the statistical properties of the model are essentially the same as for the model with strict excluded volume .",
    "for such a model the overlap energy per monomer reduces after about @xmath95 monte carlo steps from an initial value ( of the order of @xmath96 ) by three orders of magnitude , i.e. @xmath97 , and this small number is reached @xmath98 to @xmath99 times faster with pre - packing than without it . for very large systems ( and complicated models , leading to slow simulation algorithms ) it may hence be an acceptable compromise to allow a small fraction ( @xmath100 or less ) of overlap in the system .    in table  [ table1 ] we compare the average values of local density fluctuation @xmath77 \\{eq .",
