    "this extended introduction contains some definitions and an overview of the main results .",
    "additional results and refinements are discussed throughout the text .",
    "consider the idealized and somewhat fanciful billiard system shown in figure [ fancybilliard ] . at a `` macroscopic scale '' it consists of a point particle ,",
    "henceforth called the _ molecule _ , and a billiard table having piecewise smooth wall ( only a small part of which is shown ) . at a `` microscopic scale , '' both the wall and the molecule may reveal further geometric and mechanical structure that can affect the outcome of a collision . thus collisions are not necessarily specular ; to specify the outcome of a collision it is necessary to consider the interaction between molecule and wall at this finer scale .",
    "we suppose that the wall system is kept at a constant statistical state , say , a canonical ensemble distribution with a given temperature , and wish to follow the evolution of the statistical state of the molecule .",
    "the outcome of a molecule - wall _ collision event _ is then shown to be described by a time - independent transition probabilities operator @xmath0 , to be defined later as an operator on an @xmath2 space over the set of pure states of the molecule .",
    "this operator , which as we will see is canonically defined by the mechanical / geometric features of the wall and molecule microstructure and the constant statistical state of the wall , replaces the mirror - reflection map of an ordinary billiard .",
    "we call a system of this kind a _ random billiard with microstructure _ , or rbm .       discrete - time markov chains associated to @xmath0 are interpreted as random states of the molecule immediately after each collision , starting from some initial probability distribution , at least for simple shapes of the the billiard domain such as cylinders or balls .",
    "besides determining the equilibrium states of the molecule as the stationary ( i.e. , @xmath0-invariant ) probability distributions for the markov chain , the operator @xmath0 contains information about rates of decay of correlations and spectral data , which can in principle be used to derive transport coefficients such as the diffusion constant of a gas of non - interacting molecules moving inside a `` billiard channel . ''",
    "( see figure [ channel ] . )    here we develop some of these ideas in detail , focusing on the billiard - markov operator @xmath0 and its relationship with the microstructure .",
    "the main results of the paper are concerned with defining @xmath0 for any given newtonian molecule - wall system , deriving its basic functional analytic properties , describing stationary probability distributions , and illustrating with concrete examples some of the spectral properties of p.    there are several sources of motivations for this work , some purely mathematical and others more applied . on the purely mathematical side ,",
    "we seek to have interesting and well - motivated classes of markov chains that can be used to investigate issues of general interest in probability theory , such as spectral gap , mixing times , central limit theorems , etc .",
    "the statistical mechanics perspective in combination with very simple mechanical systems provides a great variety of examples .",
    "we also believe that generalized billiard systems of the kind we are considering may provide fruitful examples of random ( often hyperbolic ) dynamical systems with singularities , i.e. , random counterparts of the widely studied chaotic billiards , for which @xcite is a recommended reference . on the more applied side , processes of the kind we are studying here may be useful in kinetic theory of gases as suggested , for example , in @xcite in the context of knudsen diffusion studies . in the context of the theory of boltzmann equations , operators such as our @xmath0 may serve to specify boundary conditions for gas - wall systems .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite for the context in the theory of boltzmann equations in which related operators , but not derived from any explicit microscopic interaction model like ours , arise . )",
    "our random collision operators provide very natural and simple newtonian models for the interaction of a molecule with a heat bath that can be used to study thermostatic action fairly explicitly and often analytically from the perspective of the general theory of markov chains .",
    "the main definitions pertaining to the billiard microstructure are as follows .",
    "let @xmath3 be a smooth manifold whose points represent the configurations of a mechanical system .",
    "the system consists of two interacting subsystems : the _ wall _ and the _ molecule_. a motion in @xmath3 describes a molecule - wall _ collision event _ in which the molecule comes close to the the wall surface , scatters off of it , and moves away . let smooth riemannian manifolds @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the configuration spaces of the _ wall _ and the _ molecule _ subsystems ; to capture the idea that there is a direction towards which the ( center of mass of ) the molecule approaches the plane of the wall , and that the microstructure on the wall is periodic , we assume that @xmath5 factors as a riemannian product @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the manifold of molecular configurations under the assumption that the center of mass is at a fixed position . for the examples of interest , @xmath8 .    in the example of figure [ fancybilliard ] , @xmath4 is simply an interval @xmath9 $ ] , representing the range of positions of the wall - bound mass attached to the spring .",
    "the riemannian metric on @xmath4 is derived from the kinetic energy of the wall - bound mass .",
    "the manifold @xmath10 may be written as @xmath11 $ ] , specifying the spatial orientation ( or angle of rotation ) of the hollowed little disc and the position of the vibrating mass in its interior .",
    "the riemannian metric is , again , derived from the kinetic energy of the molecule system , so metric coefficients are given by the values of masses and moments of inertia .",
    "the plane of the wall is aligned with the factor @xmath12 and the direction of approach of the molecule is the factor @xmath13 in the product .",
    "we disregard the possible ( `` macroscopic '' ) curvature of the billiard table boundary  the interaction is imagined to happen at a length scale in which boundary curvature can not be discerned .    back to the general case , the combined _ wall - molecule system _",
    "is represented by @xmath3 with a riemannian metric and a _ potential function _",
    "@xmath14 such that ( 1 ) the two subsystems are non - interacting when they are sufficiently far apart ( more details below ) and , ( 2 ) for each value @xmath15 of the total energy @xmath16 , where @xmath17 for @xmath18 , the subset of the level set @xmath19 consisting of states at which the subsystems are a bounded distance from each other has finite volume with respect to the invariant volume form @xmath20 , whose definition is recalled later .    to explain assumption ( 1 )",
    ", we assume the existence of a smooth function @xmath21 , interpreted as the distance in euclidian space from the center of mass of the molecule to some reference position on the wall .",
    "for each real number @xmath22 define @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and denote by @xmath25 and @xmath26 the projections onto @xmath27 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "then we suppose that there exists an @xmath28 , which can be taken with no loss of generality to be less than @xmath29 , such that , for all @xmath30 ,    1 .",
    "the set @xmath31 is isometric to , and will be identified with , @xmath32 2 .",
    "there are smooth functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that @xmath35 3 .   for each value @xmath15 of the energy function @xmath36",
    "the level set @xmath37 has finite volume relative to @xmath20 ; 4 .",
    "the system is _ essentially dynamically complete _ , in the following sense : any smooth curve @xmath38 that satisfies newton s equation ( with acceleration defined in terms of the levi - civita connection ) @xmath39 can be extended indefinitely in the interior of @xmath3 , until it reaches the boundary ; whenever @xmath40 intersects the boundary transversely at a regular point @xmath41 , it can be extended further back into the interior along the unique solution curve with initial state @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the standard reflection map .    in the example of figure [ examplev ]",
    ", @xmath7 is the two - point set @xmath45 labeling the two sheets of @xmath3 above a certain distance from the handles .",
    "the manifold @xmath4 consists of a single point and the potential function @xmath46 is constant .",
    "we give @xmath3 , say , the riemannian metric induced from euclidean @xmath47-space .",
    "more representative examples , in which @xmath4 is non - trivial will be shown later .",
    "as already noted , the various manifolds above may have boundary .",
    "boundary points represent collision configurations .",
    "it is necessary to accept manifolds whose boundaries may not be smooth . for concreteness , we adopt here the class of _ manifolds with corners _ ( see @xcite ) , which is general enough to provide plenty of meaningful examples .",
    "in particular , @xmath3 contains a set @xmath48 , the _ singular boundary _ , the complement of which is a smooth manifold with boundary in the ordinary sense of being modeled on open subsets of the upper half space .",
    "this complement is the union of the interior set @xmath49 , and the ( regular ) boundary @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , @xmath51 is contained in the closure of @xmath50 , it is nowhere dense in this closure and has measure @xmath29 in @xmath52 .",
    "since we are mainly interested in probabilistic questions , it is typically safe to ignore the singular boundary set .",
    "if @xmath53 is a regular boundary point of @xmath3 and @xmath54 is a unit vector perpendicular to the boundary at @xmath53 , we assume that a motion in @xmath3 is extended after hitting the boundary at @xmath53 in such a way that the pre- and post - collision velocities @xmath55 and @xmath56 are related according to the standard linear ( reflection ) map @xmath57 ; so `` microscopic '' collisions are specular .",
    "being an isometry of the kinetic energy metric , this map leaves the energy function @xmath16 invariant .",
    "let @xmath58 be the level set @xmath59 in @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath60 and @xmath61 the restriction of @xmath62 to @xmath58 ( more precisely , the pull - back of @xmath62 under the inclusion @xmath63 ) .",
    "informally , crossing @xmath58 amounts to entering the zone of interaction @xmath64 , though s itself lies in the product zone .",
    "the vectors in @xmath61 pointing into the zone of interaction form the subset @xmath65 .",
    "this is the set of _ incoming states_. the set of _ outgoing states _ , @xmath66 ,",
    "is similarly defined as the set of vectors in @xmath61 pointing out of the zone of interaction .",
    "omitting , as we often do , the base point in @xmath3 when referring to a state in @xmath61 , then @xmath67 sends an element of @xmath66 to an element of @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the half - space in @xmath70 .",
    "then the incoming states decompose as a product @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we have chosen this particular decomposition so that the `` observable '' quantities of the molecule are grouped into the first factor and the quantities to be chosen probabilistically are grouped into the second and third factors .",
    "a _ collision event _ is defined by an application of the map @xmath74 , which gives the return state from an initial state in @xmath65 , obtained by integrating the equations of motion . under our general assumptions",
    "this map is defined on almost all initial states by poincar recurrence , and for many systems of interest it can be shown that @xmath75 is smooth on a dense open set of full measure .",
    "we make this almost everywhere smoothness a standing assumption . for simplicity",
    ", we indicate the domain of @xmath75 simply by @xmath65 , ignoring the fact that it is really defined on an open dense subset of full measure .",
    "it is convenient to redefine @xmath75 by composing it with the reflection map @xmath76 , so that @xmath75 becomes a self - map of @xmath65 .",
    "thus we add to the above list of assumptions :    1 .",
    "the return map @xmath75 is smooth on an open dense subset of @xmath65 of full measure .",
    "let @xmath77 be any given probability measure on @xmath78 .",
    "the physically most natural and interesting choice for @xmath77 corresponds to taking the product of the uniform distribution on @xmath79 and the gibbs canonical distribution on @xmath80 with parameter @xmath81 , whose definition is recalled later .",
    "the choice of measure fixes the statistical state of the wall system .",
    "the collection of possible states of the molecule system is the space @xmath82 of borel probability measures on @xmath83 .",
    "we now define the map @xmath84 that associates to each statistical state @xmath85 the new state @xmath86 .",
    "notations and general explanations are further provided in section [ randomdynsys ] .",
    "the interpretation is that , to obtain the return statistical state of the molecule , we take its present state @xmath87 , form the combined state @xmath88 of the system , let it evolve under @xmath75 , thus yielding @xmath89 , and finally project the outcome back to @xmath83 under the natural projection @xmath90 . the asterisk indicates the push - forward operation on measures .",
    "consider again the system of figure [ examplev ] as an example .",
    "in that case @xmath4 is trivial ( a single point ) and @xmath83 is identified with @xmath91 , where @xmath69 is the half - plane in @xmath92 .",
    "it does not make sense in this case to consider a gibbs canonical distribution ",
    "a natural measure @xmath77 here is the uniform probability distribution on @xmath12 . since in this example",
    "the speed of the particle does not change , we consider not the full @xmath83 but a level set for the energy ( say , only states with unit velocity ) .",
    "so we let @xmath93 , which parametrizes the sheet number ( @xmath94 ) and the angle @xmath95 of the incoming trajectory relative to the normal to the wall plane .",
    "writing @xmath96 for a point in @xmath83 , we can define @xmath0 by first indicating how it acts on , say , essentially bounded functions on @xmath83 and then defining its action on @xmath82 by duality , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 indicates the integral of @xmath99 with respect to @xmath87 .",
    "thus if @xmath99 is a bounded function on @xmath83 , and @xmath100 is the state of return to @xmath83 under @xmath75 for @xmath101 , then from the general definition we have , @xmath102    when the ( macroscopic ) billiard table is a channel as shown in figure [ channel ] , iterates of @xmath0 give the post - collision states of a random flight of the molecule ( say , in a gas of non - interacting molecules ) inside the channel .     and the pre - collision state .",
    "the stationary distribution @xmath87 is interpreted as describing the state after the molecule has reached thermal equilibrium with the wall .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]     diffusion approximation of the random flight and the dependence of the diffusion constant on the spectrum of @xmath0 are issues of particular interest , which will be investigated in another paper dedicated to central limit theorems for @xmath0 and related topics .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is a determination of the stationary probability measures of @xmath0 .",
    "recall that a probability measure @xmath87 is said to be _ stationary _ for @xmath0 if @xmath103 .",
    "we consider two possibilities : ( 1 ) the space @xmath4 reduces to a point , in which case the wall is regarded as a rigid , unmoving body that does not exchange energy with the billiard particle in a collision .",
    "note that , in this case , the billiard chamber might still have a non - trivial structure , but it does not contain moving parts . in this case , the measure @xmath77 that enters in the definition of @xmath0 is taken to be the normalized lebesgue measure on @xmath79 ; ( 2 ) the space @xmath4 has dimension at least one .",
    "this means that the wall system has moving parts and energy can be transferred between wall and molecule in a collision . in this case",
    "we assume for the purposes of the next theorem that @xmath77 is the product of the normalized lebesgue measure on @xmath79 and the gibbs canonical measure on the phase space @xmath104 with a fixed parameter @xmath105 .",
    "the latter can be written as follows ( a fuller discussion of invariant measures is given in the last section of the paper ) : @xmath106 where @xmath16 is the energy function on @xmath104 , @xmath107 is the invariant ( liouville ) volume form on energy level sets in @xmath104 derived from the symplectic form on this space , and the vertical bars indicate the associated measure .",
    "the denominator is a normalization factor .",
    "we consider similar measures on @xmath108 more precisely , in case ( 1 ) we fix a value @xmath15 of the energy function of the molecule , which remains constant throughout the process , and consider the microcanonical measure for this value , given by @xmath109 where @xmath58 is the hypersurface of separation between the product zone and the zone of interaction previously described , @xmath110 is the invariant volume form on the part of the level set @xmath111 above @xmath58 and the denominator is a normalizing factor . in case ( 2 ) we define @xmath112 a description of these measures better suited for applications will be given shortly .",
    "in the special case when @xmath7 reduces to a point , so that @xmath113 , these measures are as follows : in case ( 1 ) we may choose @xmath15 so that the molecule state lies in the unit hemisphere in @xmath69 . indicating by @xmath114 the standard volume form on the unit hemisphere and by @xmath54",
    "the unit normal vector to @xmath58 , say , pointing into the zone of interaction , we have , up to a normalization constant @xmath115 , @xmath116 which we refer to as the _ knudsen _ probability distribution ; and in case ( 2 ) @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are , respectively , the standard inner product and volume element in @xmath70 .",
    "this measure is the maxwell - boltzmann distribution at boundary points .",
    "[ gibbs ] let @xmath120 be the markov operator associated to a probability measure @xmath77 on @xmath121 .    1 .",
    "in case ( 1 ) above , let @xmath77 be the normalized lebesgue measure on @xmath79 .",
    "then the microcanonical distribution [ microcanonical ] is a stationary probability for @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   in case",
    "( 2 ) above , let @xmath77 be the product of the normalized lebesgue measure on @xmath79 and the gibbs canonical distribution on @xmath104 with temperature parameter @xmath105 . then the gibbs canonical distribution on @xmath83 given by [ gibbsmolecule ] , with the same parameter @xmath105 , is a stationary probability for @xmath0 .    in the particular case when the molecule reduces to a point ,",
    "the stationary measures are , respectively , the knudsen distribution in case ( 1 ) and the boundary maxwell - boltzmann distribution in case ( 2 ) .",
    "the proof of this theorem is given at the end of subsection [ productsystems ] .",
    "the stationary probability is often ( but not always ) unique and one often obtains convergence of @xmath122 to the stationary state for any initial distribution @xmath123 .",
    "thus the dynamic of a markov chain derived from @xmath0 describes the process of relaxation of the molecule s state toward thermal equilibrium with the wall . to understand this process in each particular situation",
    "it is necessary to study the operator @xmath0 in more detail ; we do this later in the text for a few concrete examples .",
    "the following definition is further elaborated in section [ randomdynsys ] .",
    "we say that the molecule - wall system is _ symmetric _ if on the state space @xmath65 are defined two automorphisms @xmath124 and @xmath125 such that :    1 .",
    "these maps preserve the natural measure @xmath126 on @xmath127 derived from the symplectic structure ; 2 .",
    "they respect the product fibration @xmath128 and both induce the same map @xmath129 on @xmath83 ; that is , @xmath130 3 .",
    "@xmath124 is time reversing : @xmath131 ; and @xmath125 commutes with @xmath75 : @xmath132 .",
    "the existence of the map @xmath124 is typically assured by the time reversibility of newtonian mechanics and the symmetry @xmath125 can often be obtained by a simple extension of the original system that does not affect its essential physical properties .",
    "( this is akin to defining an orientation double cover of a possibly non - oriented manifold . )",
    "the assumption of symmetry is thus a very weak one .",
    "these points are further discussed in section [ randomdynsys ] and in some of the specific examples studied later in the paper .",
    "it is natural to consider the associated operator , still denoted @xmath0 , on the hilbert space @xmath133 , where @xmath87 is one of the stationary probabilities obtained in theorem [ gibbs ] .",
    "we are particularly interested in the spectral theory of @xmath0 .",
    "a first general observation in this direction is the following .",
    "[ theoremselfadjoint ] let @xmath87 be the stationary measure of @xmath0 obtained in theorem [ gibbs ] and suppose that the system is symmetric .",
    "then @xmath0 is a self - adjoint operator on @xmath133 of norm @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 has real spectrum contained in @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "it is often the case ( this will be proved for a simple but representative example later in this paper , and has been shown for special classes of @xmath0 in previous papers ; see @xcite ) that @xmath0 is a compact , integral operator ( hilbert - schmidt ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath0 are then invariants of the system , depending in a canonical way on structural parameters like mass ratios , potential functions , curvatures , etc .",
    "the relationship between the spectrum of @xmath0 and these parameters is one of the central issues in this subject .    of particular interest",
    "is the _ spectral gap _ of @xmath0 , defined as @xmath1 minus the spectral radius of the restriction of @xmath0 to the orthogonal complement to the constant functions . as is well - known ( see , for example , @xcite ) the spectral gap can be used to estimate the exponential rate of convergence of @xmath135 to the stationary distribution in the total variation or the @xmath2 norm .    a perturbation approach to the spectrum of @xmath0 , which is valid when the molecule scattering is not far from specular",
    ", can be very fruitful . to make sense of this ,",
    "first define @xmath136,\\ ] ] where @xmath137 is a distance function on @xmath83 , @xmath138 is an initial state , @xmath139 is the random variable representing the scattered state after one collision event , and @xmath140 $ ] is conditional expectation given the initial state @xmath55 .",
    "we call @xmath141 the _ second moment of scattering_. under the identification of @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( see above ) , specular reflection corresponds to @xmath142 almost surely and small deviations from specularity correspond to small values of the second moment of scattering .",
    "we now defined the operator @xmath143 which we refer to as the _ random billiard laplacian _ ( or the _ markov laplacian _ ) of the system .",
    "the billiard laplacian , for small values of @xmath141 often approximates a second order differential operator . in the examples",
    "studied , this will be seen to be a ( densely defined ) self - adjoint operator on the same hilbert space on which @xmath0 is defined , whose eigenvalue problem amounts to a standard sturm - liouville equation .",

    "mass @xmath145 , with position coordinate @xmath146 , is restricted to move in the interval @xmath147 and @xmath148 , with position coordinate @xmath149 , can move freely on @xmath150 .",

    "the wall at @xmath151 is regarded as permeable to @xmath148 but not to @xmath145 .",
    "the random state @xmath77 of @xmath145 is taken to be the product of the uniform distribution over @xmath9 $ ] and a gaussian probability with mean @xmath29 and variance @xmath152 for its velocity .",
    "mass @xmath148 is the molecule and mass @xmath145 is part of the wall system .",
    "we refer to this as the _ two - masses _ system . to simplify notation and for other conveniences we rescale positions and velocities according to @xmath153 and @xmath154 , where @xmath155 .",
    "the main structural parameter of the system is the _ mass - ratio _ @xmath156 .",
    "we let @xmath157 represent the markov operator with mass - ratio @xmath158 .",
    "further details are explained in section [ twomasses ] .",
    "we summarize in the next theorem some of the main conclusions obtained for the two - masses example .",
    "( further refinements and numerical calculations are described in that section . )",

    "based on part 4 of the above theorem and a simple analysis of the corresponding sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem ( the equation in part 4 is , after the change of coordinates @xmath170 , laguerre s equation ) , we can make an educated guess as to the asymptotic value , for small @xmath158 , of the spectral gap of @xmath157 : it is given by @xmath171 .",
