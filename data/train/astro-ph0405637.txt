    "the region between these two probably contains a mixture of starbursts and normal galaxies at various redshifts . in figure 2a ,",
    "the black points occupy the most of the first region .",
    "these are 24@xmath0 sources which have significant detections at 8@xmath0 as well as @xmath1-band . comparing with the model color - color tracks",
    ", we infer that the sources with @xmath39 and @xmath40 are primarily normal , infrared faint galaxies at low redshift ( @xmath43 ) and optically selected qsos with a wider redshift distribution .",
    "figure 3a , b show the differential number counts as functions of colors , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "a little less than 30%  of the total population are infrared quiescent spirals and early type galaxies at low redshifts as well as optically selected qsos .",
    "the galaxies with extremely low 24-to-8micron flux ratio are old bulges , such as m31 .",
    "their colors can not be explained by pure interstellar dust emission , and they must have substantial stellar photospheric and dust envelope contributions coming into the 8@xmath0 band .    to test further this interpretation of figure 2a ,",
    "we have used the ned extragalactic database and identified the sources in our catalog with the low redshift galaxies ( magenta triangles ) and optically selected qsos ( cyan triangles ) from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the locations of these sources with known types and redshifts in figure 2a generally confirm our interpretation .",
    "the cyan points in figure 2a can be well explained by the computed colors of a radio - quiet qso sed template in figure 2b .",
    "these optically selected qsos have fairly flat seds ( neugebauer et al .",
    "1987 ; sanders et al .",
    "1989 ) , therefore , their colors are around @xmath46 and @xmath47 with very little change with redshifts .",
    "one specific example is a sloan qso at @xmath48 , with the fluxes of 744@xmath4jy , 98  @xmath4jy and 27  @xmath4jy at the 24 , 8 and 0.7@xmath4 m respectively , thus @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "figure 2a illustrates the colors of four types of sources marked with small black , red , green and blue points .",
    "the objects indicated with black points have been discussed before .",
    "the red points consist 31%  of the 24@xmath0 sources , which are detected only in @xmath1-band , but not at the 8@xmath0-band .",
    "the green points represent 4% , with detections only in 8@xmath0 , but no counterparts in @xmath1 brighter than 2@xmath3 limit of 25.5mag .",
    "finally , 13%  of the sample ( 660 objects per sq.degree ) are not detected in either 8@xmath0 or @xmath1 , shown as small blue points in figure 2a .",
    "the mean fluxes of the objects marked as red , green and blue points are roughly between 230 - 360@xmath4jy .",
    "one of the most interesting sources revealed by the 24@xmath0 images are ones which have @xmath42 and @xmath51 in figure 2a .",
    "these sources are candidates for being luminous starburst galaxies at @xmath9 . using this color - color cut",
    ", we estimate that 23%  ( @xmath51200 per sq.degree ) of our 24@xmath0 sample are such objects .",
    "in particular , those sources detected only at 24@xmath0 ( blue points ) are likely to be uligs at @xmath21 ( 660 per sq.degrees ) . at @xmath52 ,",
    "our 3@xmath3 24@xmath0 flux limit of 110@xmath4jy corresponds to the observed luminosity @xmath53 of @xmath54 .",
    "if we ignore the filter difference between the spitzer 24@xmath0 and the iras 12@xmath0 ( the 24@xmath0 bandwidth is about half of the 12@xmath0 filter ) , the @xmath55 observed 24@xmath0 luminosity is roughly the rest - frame iras 12@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "the total infrared luminosity @xmath56 is correlated with iras 12@xmath4 m luminosity @xmath57 , in the form of @xmath58 , as derived from the iras revised bright galaxy sample ( soifer et al . 1987 ; chary &  elbaz 2001 ) .",
    "this implies that the @xmath59 starbursts should have @xmath60 . as suggested by the 24@xmath0 source counts ( marleau et al .",
    "2004 ) , the fls data may reach @xmath61 starburst population .",
    "our flux limit implies that at @xmath61 , the infrared luminosity @xmath62 should be brighter than @xmath63 .    another interesting population are sources with @xmath64 but with a fairly constant @xmath65 .",
    "figure 2b suggests that these sources are likely to be dust heavily reddened agns like ngc  1068 , or mrk231 at @xmath59 .",
    "these sources could be separated from the general population using the irac 8-to-4.5 and 5.8-to-3.5micron color - color selection ( lacy et al .",
    "the surface density of these dusty agns are on the order of @xmath585 per sq.degree , and they constitute @xmath52%  of the total 24@xmath0 population . to confirm our prediction that we can use @xmath44 vs. @xmath66 to select high redshift , infrared luminous galaxies",
    ", we mark on figure 2a the several 24@xmath0 sources detected with the scuba at 850@xmath0 ( see frayer et al .",
    "2004 for detail )",
    ". these scuba sources could be at @xmath67 , as shown in chapman et al .",
    "our computed color - color tracks in figure 2 is to illustrate in a broad sense what range of colors each type of sources should have .",
    "a small number of sources with extremely red 24-to-8 and 24-to - r colors can not be all explained by models with known type of seds .",
    "this could be suggestive of potentially new classes of objects .",
    "we examine the optical brightness of 24@xmath0 selected sources in figure 4 , showing the @xmath45 and @xmath44 as a function of @xmath1 magnitude for the 24@xmath0 sources .",
    "close to 36%of the 24@xmath0 sources have @xmath1 magnitudes fainter than 23.0mag .",
    "such a faint optical magnitude might suggest that they are at @xmath68 , supported by the measurements from optical @xmath1 band selected redshift surveys ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; cohen et al . 2001 ) .",
    "many of these sources are well within the brightness regime of the 10  meter classes telescopes for obtaing the optical spectroscopic redshifts .",
