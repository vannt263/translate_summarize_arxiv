    "in the present work a method for solving the problem of time - dependent electromagnetic wave propagation through an isotropic inhomogeneous medium is developed . several ideas concerning such mathematical notions as bicomplex and biquaternionic reformulations of electromagnetic models , hyperbolic vekua - type equations and transmutation operators from the theory of ordinary linear differential equations",
    "are combined in our approach which results in a simple and practical representation for solutions .",
    "we observe that the 1 + 1 maxwell system for inhomogeneous media can be transformed into a hyperbolic vekua equation .",

    "application of the recent results on the analytic approximation of such operators allows us to write down the electromagnetic wave in an approximate analytic form which is then used for numerical computation .",
