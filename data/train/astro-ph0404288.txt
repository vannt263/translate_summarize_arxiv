    "molecular hydrogen is an important coolant during the epoch of primordial galaxy and first star formation .",
    "model calculations indicate that radiatively - induced cooling due to collisions of h@xmath1 , primarily with h , dominate the cooling of collapsing primordial gas clouds from temperatures beginning at @xmath2  k and going down to @xmath3  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the importance of h@xmath1 in the early universe is supported by the recent _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) measurements which suggest ( a ) that reionization occured at high redshift and ( b ) a large thompson scattering optical depth .",
    "these results require star formation at this redshift to produce the ionizing radiation , which implies that h@xmath1 cooling is important for early star formation @xcite . given the pivotal role that h@xmath1 is predicted to play , an accurate understanding of its formation and destruction in the early universe is crucial for understanding the formation of hierarchical structure ( haiman , thoul , & loeb 1996 ; abel et al .",
    "1997 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ; galli & palla 1998 ; flower 2002 ; lepp , stancil , & dalgarno 2002 ; nakamura & umemura 2002 ; ricotti , gnedin , & shull 2002 ) .    the early universe chemistry of h@xmath1 during the epoch of primordial galaxy and first star formation has been reviewed recently by a number of groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these authors have found that the relative h@xmath1 abundances are determined by only a handful of processes .",
    "of particular interest , @xcite point out that the charge transfer ( ct ) process @xmath4 is the dominant destruction mechanism of h@xmath1 during the formation at this epoch of halos with viral temperatures @xmath5  k. this process dominates until a collapsing cloud of primordial gas begins internally to emit ionizing radiation or until the background extragalactic uv radiation field has reached significant levels .",
    "then the dominant destruction mechanism becomes photodissociation through the lyman - werver bands via the two - step solomon process ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ) .    because of the fundamental importance of reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] )",
    ", reliable rate coefficients for this process are needed for our understanding of the formation of structure in the early universe . however , as discussed below , the various rate coefficients adopted by the astrophysics community for this process differ from one another by orders of magnitude .",
    "this translates into orders of magnitude uncertainties in the predicted relative abundance of h@xmath1 at key epochs .",
    "furthermore , this uncertainty directly affects the predicted properties of collapsing gas clouds during primordial galaxy and first star formation .    to help address the need for accurate rate coefficients for reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) ,",
    "@xcite has recently carried out the first quantum mechanical calculations for this process at collision energies relevant for the cosmological formation of structure .",
    "his results are appropriate for current models of early universe chemistry , which treat all molecules as being in their ground rovibrational state .",
    "these models have not yet evolved to the point where they take into account the electronic and rovibrational distribution of molecules ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "throughout the rest of this paper only ground electronic configurations are considered",
    ".    in   [ sec : review ] , we give a brief review of the previous experimental and theoretical work for reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) .",
    "a short description of the theoretical calculations by @xcite is given in ",
    "[ sec : theoretical ] . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our new rate coefficient , provide a simple fitting formula that can readily be incorporated into early universe chemistry models , and comment on our results .",
    "lastly , in   [ sec : cosmological ] we briefly discuss some of the cosmological implications of our results .",
    "ct of h@xmath6 on h@xmath1(@xmath7 ) is an endothermic process with a threshold of 1.83  ev @xcite .",
    "cosmologically , reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) is important at temperatures of @xmath8  ev , where @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "hence , it is the behavior of the cross section just above threshold that is most important for primordial chemistry .",
    "the only cross section measurements in this energy range have been carried out by holliday , muckerman , & friedman ( 1971 ) .",
    "a rate coefficient measurement for the reverse of reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) has been carried out at a temperature of @xmath10  k by karpas , anicich , & huntress ( 1979 ) .",
    "rate coefficients for reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) have been presented by a number of different groups . in figure",
    "[ fig : h2hplusct ] we present the various published data multiplied by @xmath11 to remove the effects due to the threshold for this reaction .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite appear to present data derived using detailed balance between the forward and reverse directions of reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) and the rate coefficient measurement for the reverse direction by @xcite .",
    "however , reading their papers and their cited sources , how their data are actually derived is unclear .",
    "@xcite state explicitly that their data are derived from detailed balance between the forward and reverse directions of reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) and the measurements of karpas et al .",
    "yet , as shown in figure  [ fig : h2hplusct ] , these four recommended rate coefficients all differ from one another dramatically in both magnitude and temperature dependence , despite their all apparently being based on detailed balanced between the forward and reverse directions of reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) and despite the use of the same single temperature laboratory measurement .",
    "we note that the application of detailed balance is only strictly valid for state - to - state reactions , i.e. , when the @xmath12 level of the reactant _ and _ product molecules are known . while typical laboratory conditions are such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 is likely to be small for the reactant , the product @xmath12 is usually unknown .",
    "for example , krsti ( 2002 ) finds that for the reverse of reaction ( 1 ) , the product h@xmath1 is primarily formed into @xmath15 , not @xmath13 . therefore , estimation of reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) by the application of detailed balance to the measured rate coefficient for the reverse reaction gives the rate coefficient for h@xmath1(@xmath15 ) , which can be as much as an order of magnitude larger than for h@xmath1(@xmath13 ) .",
    "rate coefficients which are estimated by detailed balance are therefore suspect .",
    "some groups have derived the needed rate coefficients using the cross section measurements of @xcite .",
    "@xcite integrated the recommended cross section data of @xcite , which are based on the measurements by holliday et al .",
    "@xcite directly integrated the data of holliday et al .",
    "hence , it is unclear why the rate coefficients of abel et al .  and galli & palla differ so dramatically in both temperature dependence and absolute magnitude .",
    "linder , janev , & botero ( 1995 ) have presented a recommended cross section for reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) that we have integrated to produce a rate coefficient using the method discussed in   [ sec : theoretical ] .",
    "their cross section is based primarily on published experimental work for both this reaction and for the isotopically identical reaction @xmath16 but as pointed out by @xcite , several ev above the threshold , the recommended cross section of linder et al .",
    "is over an order of magnitude larger than the measurements of @xcite .",
    "so the relative agreement between the rate coefficients of @xcite and @xcite , despite their being based on cross section data sets that differ significantly from one another , is surprising .",
    "more recently , theoretical calculations have been carried out using the classical trajectory - surface - hopping ( tsh ) model of ichihara , iwamoto , & janev ( 2000 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : h2hplusct ] we have plotted their results as a function of plasma temperature for an h@xmath1 temperature of 0.1  ev .",
    "we expect that at this h@xmath1 temperature their results are nearly equivalent to the results for ground state h@xmath1 .",
    "the tsh method , however , is expected to provide only qualitative results for center - of - mass ( cm ) energies @xmath17  ev .",
    "early universe chemical models need rate coefficients for these reactions at temperatures @xmath18  k. this corresponds to @xmath19  ev .    to summarize ,",
    "it is clear that more sophisticated theoretical calculations and new laboratory measurements for reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) are needed .",
    "cross sections for vibrationally resolved charge - transfer of protons with h@xmath20 and of atomic hydrogen with h@xmath21 have been obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for the nuclear and electronic motions on the two lowest diabatic electronic surfaces of h@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed using a fully - quantal , coupled - channel approach by expanding the nuclear wave functions in a large vibrational basis of all discrete h@xmath23 and h@xmath24 states and corresponding discretized continua pseudostates ( altogether 900 states of positive and negative energy ) . as a consequence ,",
    "all inelastic processes ( ct , excitation , and dissociation ) were calculated on the same footing , enabling both proper population dynamics and normalization of the full @xmath25-matrix @xcite . discretized vibrational continua and large configuration spaces ( 40 atomic units [ a.u . ] in length ) were used along with the bound states to account for transitions through the `` closed '' channels and for nuclear particle exchange .",
    "the price paid of using a diabatic vibrational basis is the large number of closed channels needed to achieve the convergence of the cross sections ( typically 200 at lower energy to 600 at the highest energies considered here ) .",
    "this is partially a consequence of the large number of quasi - continuum states for representing particle - exchange channels , which are certainly present in the large , @xmath26 , quantization box .",
    "the main approximation used was the sudden approximation for rotations , often referred as the infinite order sudden approximation ( iosa ) .",
    "this technique freezes target molecule rotations during the collision and then post - collisionally averages the cross sections over all possible molecular orientations @xcite .",
    "this approximation set the lower limit of the appropriate range for calculations to a fraction of ev . in principle",
    ", there is no upper limit . with the iosa prescriptions and by expansion of the nuclear functions in the vibrational basis",
    ", the resulting system of coupled second - order ordinary differential equations in @xmath27 ( the distance from the projectile to the molecular cm ) reduces to uncoupled equations for each partial wave @xmath28 of the projectile cm motion .",
    "these were solved using as many partial waves as needed until convergence of the cross section was achieved ( going up to @xmath29 for the highest value of @xmath30 ) .",
    "the proper plane - wave boundary conditions were applied at entrance - exit of the reactant configuration ( i.e. , at @xmath31  a.u . ) , utilizing multichannel logarithmic derivatives , for both open and closed channels @xcite .",
    "the open - open submatrix of the resulting @xmath32-matrix is then used to obtain the @xmath25-matrix for each @xmath28 .",
    "a number of different definitions of the plasma rate coefficient exist in the literature .",
    "here we have calculated the rate coefficients @xmath33 taking the maxwellian average of the cross section @xmath34 over the relative energy distribution of the h@xmath6 and h@xmath1 particles using @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the reduced mass of the system , @xmath37 is the threshold energy for the considered process , and @xmath38 is the cm energy . our calculated data for @xmath39 extend from 2 to 9.5 ev .",
    "we integrated from 1.83 to 9.5 ev , by assuming @xmath40 .",
    "a spline - fit parabolic curve was used to interpolate @xmath39 between the calculated values .",
    "we estimate that the cutoff of the integration at 9.5 ev introduces less than 1% error in our results .",
    "further details of this calculation can be found elsewhere @xcite . also available for both the h@xmath41+h@xmath42 and",
    "h+h@xmath43 collision systems are the final and initial vibrational state resolved cross sections for ct @xcite , excitation @xcite , dissociation @xcite , and elastic transport @xcite .",
    "the three - body association rate coefficients for h@xmath41+h+h forming h@xmath1 in the temperature range 200 - 20,000 k have also been calculated @xcite .",
    "all the cross section data can be downloaded in tabular and graphic form from www-cfadc.phy.ornl.gov .",
    "we have calculated the rate coefficient for reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) for temperatures of @xmath44  k. this covers the range of temperatures for which reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) is cosmologically important .",
    "we present our results in figure  [ fig : h2hplusct ] .",
    "the calculated ct rate coefficient has been fitted using @xmath45 the best fit values are listed in table  [ tab : fitparameters ] .",
    "the fit is accurate to better than 4% for @xmath46  k.    our calculated results represent the most sophisticated theoretical treatment of reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) at the present time .",
    "previous rate coefficient calculations , based on detailed balance or the tsh method , are unreliable for the reasons discussed in   [ sec : review ] and can not be used to verify the validity of our results . similarly , @xcite raise questions about the reliability of the laboratory measurements by @xcite .",
    "hence , in our opinion , rate coefficients derived from the cross section data of either @xcite or @xcite can not be used to verify the reliability of our calculated results . in short ,",
    "new laboratory measurements are needed to benchmark these new calculations .",
    "using the models of @xcite , we have investigated how our new results for reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) affect the predicted gas temperature and h@xmath1 relative abundance of a collapsing gas cloud during the epoch of primordial galaxy and first star formation .",
    "calculations have been carried out first in the absence of any external uv field and then assuming an external field of @xmath47 ergs s@xmath48 @xmath49 sr@xmath48 in the lyman - werner bands of h@xmath1 ( 11.2 - 13.6 ev ) .",
    "the flux chosen for the uv field is roughly that needed to reionize the universe ( haiman , abel , & rees 2000 ) .",
    "when using an external uv field , we assumed a hydrogen column density of 10@xmath50  @xmath49 to mimic the interior of a dense , initially neutral clump .",
    "we used a cosmic h / he ratio of @xmath51 . for reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] ) , we have used the adopted data of @xcite , @xcite , and our new results .",
    "the rest of the chemical network is from @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : zoltan ] , we show the predicted gas temperature and h@xmath1 relative abundance using these three different rate coefficients . we note that using the rate coefficient of @xcite yields results similar to those using our new data . here",
    "our model follows a parcel of gas at an initial density of 10 @xmath52 .",
    "this is about @xmath53 times denser than the background intergalactic medium at a redshift @xmath54 . assuming that @xmath55 at @xmath56  s",
    ", then the evolution of the gas is followed until @xmath57  s. using the _ wmap _ results and the lcdm cosmological model of @xcite , this corresponds to a final redshift of @xmath58 .",
    "the asymptotic values for the predicted gas temperature and h@xmath1 relative abundance are little affected by the atomic physics uncertainties ( a well known result , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but as can be readily seen from the figure , for times between @xmath59 and @xmath60  s , both the predicted gas temperature and h@xmath1 relative abundance are highly sensitive to the rate coefficient chosen .",
    "these timescales are short compared to cosmic timescales but could well be relevant for the formation of the first stars @xcite .",
    "for example @xmath60  s corresponds to the dynamical time for gas at over - densities of a few times @xmath61 relative to the cosmic mean at redshift @xmath54 , and the actual star formation process may proceed on even shorter time - scales @xcite . our new theoretical results for reaction  ( [ eq : cth2 ] )",
