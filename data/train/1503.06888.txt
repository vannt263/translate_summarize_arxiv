    "superconvergence of numerical methods usually happens when the convergence rate at some special points is higher than the theoretical global rate @xcite .",
    "the investigation of superconvergence provides a fundamental insight for post - processing and adaptive algorithm design , which leads to higher accuracy and more efficient numerical methods @xcite .    for classical problems ,",
    "the superconvergence phenomenon of the @xmath0-version finite element method is    well understood and addressed in the literature , see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein . on the other hand ,",
    "there has been only a limited study of the superconvergence phenomenon for spectral methods @xcite .",
    "specifically , in @xcite , zhang identified the derivative superconvergence points of the legendre and chebyshev spectral collocation methods for the two - point boundary value problem .",
    "in addition , zhang @xcite investigated various polynomial interpolations and located superconvergence points for the function value and the first derivative .     in this paper , we conduct the first superconvergence study of fractional operators .",
    "since fractional calculus generalizes the classical ( integer - order ) differentiation and integration to any order , the study of superconvergent fractional derivatives unifies the theoretical investigation    in @xcite for the first - order derivative .    over the last two decades , fractional differential equations ( fdes )",
    "have been demonstrated to be more effective , when modeling some complex systems in physics , finance and et al .",
    "these new models are usually derived by replacing integer - order derivatives with fractional derivatives in classical models .",
    "meanwhile , there has been a growing need for the development of high - order numerical for solving fdes . the nonlocal definition of fractional derivative , existing methods including finite difference and finite element methods@xcite mostly lead to low - order schemes .",
    "spectral methods are promising candidates for solving fdes since their global nature fits well with the nonlocal definition of fractional operators . using integer - order orthogonal polynomials as basis functions , spectral methods @xcite really help with the alleviation of the memory cost for discretization of fractional derivatives .",
    "furthermore , to deal with singularities , which usually appear in fractional problems , in the works @xcite the authors design suitable bases .",
    "a major difficulty in the investigation of superconvergence of spectral methods for fractional problems , compared with integer - order derivatives , is the nonlocality of the fractional operator and the complicated form of fractional derivatives .",
    "the second challenge is the construction of a good basis for a spectral scheme .",
    "given a suitable basis , one can then begin the analysis of the approximation error in order to locate the superconvergence points .",
    "in this paper , we interpolate function values using polynomials , and use the error equation to obtain superconvergent points for fractional derivatives .",
    "it turns out that these superconvergence points are zeros of the fractional derivatives of the corresponding polynomials .",
    "we also consider the interpolation of fractional riemann - liouville derivatives , and apply a gjf - spectral - petrov - galerkin scheme @xcite to solve an equivalent fractional initial - value problem .",
    "we have found that superconvergence points for numerical function values and fractional riemann - liouville derivatives are zeros of corresponding basis functions and gauss points , respectively .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 , we define notation and give properties of fractional derivatives and of gjfs .",
    "the interpolations of the function values using various polynomials are presented in section 3 .",
    "moreover , we analyse the error to identify superconvergence points for fractional derivatives of the interpolant . in section 4 , we show the locations of the superconvergence points both for the numerical solution and the fractional derivatives using a gjf - spectral - petrov - galerkin scheme .",
