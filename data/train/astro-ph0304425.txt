    "in the widely adopted cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmological models , small objects are the first to form , and larger galaxies form via the merger of dwarf systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the evolution of the smaller building blocks is therefore of great interest for the evolution of larger systems .",
    "because they formed prior to the emergence of normal galaxies , these subsystems are theoretically expected to have greater density than the larger systems , and therefore they are likely to retain their integrity in the halo of large host galaxies , which would imply the existence of many more surviving systems than are observed today @xcite .",
    "the lack of small stellar systems around larger host galaxies has been referred to as the `` missing satellite '' problem @xcite .",
    "one possible resolution of the problem is that gaseous baryonic matter may have been ejected from the dwarf systems due to massive star formation , which in turn leads to photoionization - driven outflows , stellar winds , and supernovae @xcite .",
    "once segregated , the ordinary matter continues to its dissipational infall , while the dark matter components form a lumpy halo in the potential of the large galaxy @xcite .",
    "if the mass loss is driven by bursts of star formation , a small amount of residual ordinary matter , which has already been converted into stars , would remain with the clumpy dark matter subsystems .    in the halo of the galaxy , several dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs )",
    "are found in the form of diffuse patches of stellar light @xcite embedded in dark matter haloes ( aaronson 1983 ; faber & lin 1983 ) .",
    "it is natural to identify these with the remnant subsystems , _",
    "i.e. _ the theoretical building blocks of large host galaxies in the cdm scenario @xcite , because they have similar total mass ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "there are , however , significant differences .",
    "both the small ( few km  s@xmath1 ) velocity dispersions , and the inferred dynamical density of the observed dwarf galaxies are smaller than those postulated in the cdm models . also , the spread in the observed amount of luminous matter ( and hence the mass to light ratio ) in the dsphs is much larger than that in their total mass @xcite",
    ".    some of the above differences may be due to evolution .",
    "the dsphs are found to have a wide range of star - formation and enrichment histories , with few clear trends @xcite .",
    "all contain populations of old stars of varying sizes , and ages exceeding 10  gyr .",
    "in addition , some show histories of continuous star formation , many others show evidence of bursts of star formation separated widely in time , and a few show little or no evidence of subsequent star formation . the observed stellar population and the modest mass - to - light ratio of the dsphs are consistent with the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the original baryonic matter may have been ejected from them and other dwarf galaxies as a consequence of earlier epochs of star formation @xcite .",
    "in addition to dsphs , the families of low - mass , gas - poor dwarf stellar systems also include dwarf elliptical galaxies , and globular clusters .",
    "these groups of objects are quite distinct from each other @xcite . some of their differences may , however , result from post - formation evolution processes , such as mass loss either prior to or following star formation ( see discussion above ) , or segregation of baryonic and dark matter during star formation @xcite",
    ". the globular clusters are the low - mass extreme of these families of dwarf stellar systems .",
    "their velocity dispersions are generally more than twice that of the dsphs within the local group of galaxies , but less than that of typical dwarf elliptical galaxies within nearby clusters of galaxies .",
    "in contrast to the dwarf spheroidal galaxies , all but one or two globular clusters of the milky way show evidence for only a single , old stellar population . as in those dwarf galaxies which show little evidence for more than a single generation of star formation , any gas within globular clusters that remained after the initial generation of stars formed must have been lost from within them .",
    "nevertheless , the multiple populations of stars in at least one globular cluster ( @xmath2 cen ) and several dwarf galaxies indicate that the star formation process may not always be an effective mechanism for decoupling the ordinary and dark matter in these loosely bound stellar systems .",
    "collectively , the population of the observed dwarf stellar systems falls far below that predicted in the cdm model , and so they alone can not be the resolution of the `` missing satellite '' problem .",
    "gravitational lensing observations , however , find preliminary indications of starless dark matter clumps in the halos of nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "if such dark entities dominate the halo structure , then an efficient and severe segregation of ordinary and dark matter , through processes in addition to the violent impact of star formation , is needed .",
    "a more quiescent process may therefore also play a significant role in determining the ability of dwarf stellar systems to retain their gas to form multiple generations of stars @xcite .",
    "we shall address the cause of multiple generations of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies in a separate paper .",
    "several gas dynamical processes may lead to gas removal from stellar systems with shallow potentials .",
    "prior to star formation , gas may be removed by either ram - pressure or kelvin - helmholtz instability resulting from motion through the halo gas of a larger system @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of gas removal due to either process depends upon the depth of the gravitational potential , and the density of ambient gas . while it is possible that the dwarf galaxies and globular clusters seen today were able to retain sufficient gas to form stars within them because they have deeper potentials than the dark matter - dominated `` missing satellites , '' the amount of ambient gas in the halo of the large , host galaxies is highly uncertain .    in the halo of the milky way and other galaxies , both satellite dwarf galaxies and star clusters are subject to tidal forces . for dsphs",
    ", this process occurs following the formation of a nearby , massive galaxy , whereas star clusters form within the potential of a massive system .",
    "the tidal forces increase rapidly in significance for smaller orbits around the host galaxy , and can strongly perturb any ionized gas within the satellite stellar systems .",
    "the resulting situation is somewhat analogous to that of interacting binary stars @xcite , in that the ionized gas in the satellite systems always relaxes , and expands to fill their roche lobes . a fraction of the gas continually streams away from the satellite systems through their inner and outer lagrange points .",

    "the essence of our results is contained in tables  [ tab:1dgalaxies ] , [ tab:3dgalaxies ] , and [ tab:3dclusters ] .",
    "the results of the calculations in  [ sec:1dmodels ] indicate that gas in typical dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) can be fully ionized , even by a modest background uv flux .",
    "but for the more extended and dwarf elliptical galaxies , a fraction of the residual gas can remain neutral at their central regions , especially during more recent epochs . even for these galaxies ,",
    "mass loss occurs if the dwarf galaxies are captured as satellites of larger galaxies or clusters of galaxies .    as can be seen in the tables , and expected from ",
    "[ sec : analytic ] , the time scale for mass loss is extremely sensitive to the ratio @xmath163 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath67 can be directly measured from the central velocity dispersion .",
    "if @xmath164 , then the gas is tightly held within the potential of the dwarf stellar system .",
    "the density contrast between the center of the galaxy and the tidal radius , given by equation  ( [ eq : f ] ) , @xmath165 . in this limit ,",
    "the time scale for mass loss , @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the dynamical time scale of the dwarf system .",
    "the reverse is true when @xmath168 .    for many dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is comparable to the sound speed of ionized gas , and so , if the gas is ionized , the system should have @xmath169 .",
    "once @xmath42 , our results indicate that the gas may be lost to the dwarf system on a time scale no longer than several times @xmath167 , which is shorter than both the orbital period , @xmath82 , and the time scale on which subsequent generations of stars would be expected to form @xcite .",
    "multiple possible sources of ionizing radiation exist , including extragalactic uv , uv from a nearby massive galaxy , or uv from stars formed within the dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "the evolution of dwarf galaxies therefore depends upon their proximity to a massive galaxy , the source of the ionizing radiation , and when or if the gas within the dwarf galaxies is ionized .",
    "previous investigation by kepner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that the external uv radiation in early epochs can fully ionize residual gas in typical - mass dwarf galaxies , and so rapid mass loss might be expected .",
    "the results in  [ sec:1dmodels ] show , however , that hot ionized gas can be retained in potentials with velocity dispersions comparable to or less than the sound speed of the gas , provided that the host galaxy is isolated .",
    "thus , even in the presence of an intense uv background , low - mass dwarf galaxies do not automatically lose their gas content , albeit the density distribution can become relatively flat for systems which contain hot gas .    such an environmental dependence may help to explain differences between some types of dwarf galaxies . dwarf irregular ( dirr ) and dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies are observed to be similar in terms of their dark - matter potentials and ordinary matter content .",
    "but , a significant amount of ordinary matter in dirrs is in the form of gas , whereas little gas is found in des .",
    "it has been suggested that this difference is due to the efficiency of gas removal ( lin & faber 1983 ) , motivated by the fact that des are primarily located in clusters of galaxies , whereas dirrs are mostly found in the field .",
    "although the presence of hot gas in clusters of galaxies can lead to efficient stripping @xcite , the present results indicate that tidal effects can also remove the ionized gas in dwarf galaxies within a galactic cluster environment within several gyr .    at the center of large clusters , however , where the density is nearly homogeneous or declines slowly with radius , the tidal potential is compressive rather than disruptive . in these regions , dwarf galaxies may also be able to retain their gas content , even if it is mostly ionized .",
    "nucleated dwarfs are often found in these central regions of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the retention of residual gas may enable the dwarf systems to undergo repeated star formation , possibly leading to the formation of their nucleated structure .",
    "this dependence upon location is in the same sense as that proposed by babul & rees ( 1992 ) . in that earlier work",
    ", it was proposed that the added confinement by the denser gas near cluster centers would help to prevent supernova - driven mass loss from dwarf galaxies , allowing them to retain their gas for subsequent generations of star formation .",
    "away from the cluster center , however , where tidal forces are disruptive , they shall act in opposition to external confinement , to drive mass loss . in those regions ,",
    "the presence of a significant external medium may even enhance mass loss , via the kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite .",
    "the evolution of non - isolated dwarf systems depends upon both their masses and their proximity to a massive galaxy .",
    "the results in   [ sec:3dmodels ] indicate that if a massive galaxy forms near a dsph prior to the efficient conversion of the internal gas of the dsph into stars , then the remaining gas shall be rapidly lost to tidal stripping if it becomes ionized . in the most extreme case ,",
    "when background uv heating has ionized the gas within the dsph , preventing it from forming any stars , tidal stripping of the gas shall lead to the formation of a starless , dark - matter mini - halo orbiting the larger galaxy .",
    "only the gas component of the smaller systems is efficiently lost , because the outflow is continually replenished by the attempt to re - establish quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the dark - matter mini - haloes may be preserved , because they were formed in relatively high density environments @xcite .",
    "thus , the results presented here naturally imply that the halo of large galaxies may be populated with many ` stripped ' dark matter , self - gravitating systems .",
    "by contrast , the gas within the most massive dsphs , and that within des may be self - shielded , and remain mostly neutral .",
    "that , coupled with their deeper potentials , allows them to retain their gas for a much longer time than low mass dsphs , and form multiple generations of stars before losing their gas , even when in close proximity to a massive galaxy . the dependence of the rate of tidal stripping upon the mass of the dwarf system may provide an explanation for the `` missing satellite galaxy '' problem , because , in accordance with the cdm model , the galactic mass function decreases with @xmath5 .",
    "tidal loss is also crucial for globular clusters . as in dsphs , @xmath170 for globular clusters",
    "is a few to a few tens of km  s@xmath1 , comparable to the sound speed of ionized gas .",
    "the highly homogeneous chemical abundance among stars within any given globular cluster @xcite requires thorough mixing of the proto - cluster clouds .",
    "even with efficient turbulent mixing , many internal crossing time scales are required @xcite .",
    "thus , prior to the formation of presently observable stars in globular clusters , gas must be retained for a time comparable to or longer than their galactic orbital period .",
    "the baryonic density of globular clusters is higher than that of dsphs , and so , prior to efficient star formation , the gas was likely to be self - shielded from external heating . because the value of @xmath171 is much larger for cool atomic and molecular gas , the gas can then be retained for several galactic orbits .",
    "self - gravity of the gas was also probably very important for globular clusters at early epochs , which would further help them to retain their gas .",
    "the internal uv production following efficient star formation within a globular cluster would , however , ionize the gas , after which would be rapidly lost to the system .",
    "the same fate would apply to the most massive dsphs orbiting close to a massive galaxy . in the presence of a tidal field , therefore , star formation within dwarf systems can become a self - terminating process , even in the absence of ram pressure stripping , supernova heating , or other means of violent gas ejection .    in the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario , large galaxies are formed through coalescence of dwarf galaxies .",
    "galactic tides enable the rapid decoupling of the gas from dwarf galaxies . the tidally removed gas is detached gently from the dwarf systems , and",
    "shall form thin tidal streamers , similar to the magellanic stream .",
    "these gas streams are dispersed by differential gravity , precession , nonlinear shock dissipation , and drag by the residual gas in the halo .",
    "the tidally removed gas does , however , retain its angular momentum .",
    "when it is mixed with the residual halo gas , together they can form the disk @xcite .",
    "the `` tidally stripped '' dark matter clumps shall themselves undergo subsequent orbital decay due to dynamical friction . in outer regions of the of the large parent galaxies , the residual gas in the halo is tenuous , possibly allowing the streamers to preserve their integrity . repeated galactic encounters may lead to recapture of the gas from the streamers by the dwarf system , and induce secondary star formation",
