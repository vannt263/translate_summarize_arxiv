    "because of its proximity ( distance 8 kpc , reid 1993 ) , the center of the milky way is a unique laboratory for studying the physical processes in galactic nuclei ( e.g. genzel , hollenbach & townes 1994 , morris & serabyn 1996 , mezger , duschl & zylka 1996 , melia & falcke 2001 ) . in particular",
    ", the galactic center offers the unique opportunity for investigating stars and gas in the immediate vicinity of a supermassive black hole , at a level of detail that will not be accessible in any other galactic nucleus in the foreseeable future . in the present paper we present and analyze new high resolution , adaptive optics imaging and observations of stellar velocities in the nuclear cluster , relating to its spatial distribution , evolution and dynamics .",
    "let us summarize what is known from observations during the past decade .",
    "first , the overall surface density and surface brightness of stars increases with decreasing separation from the center near the compact radio source sgra@xmath13 ( diameter @xmath1410 light minutes , doeleman et al . 2001 ) , with a near - isothermal power law ( stellar volume density @xmath15 @xmath16 ) from projected radii @xmath17 to about @xmath18 ( catchpole , whitelock & glass 1990 ) . within that radius",
    "the surface brightness continues to increase inward to 1  but the stellar surface number density at moderately bright magnitudes ( k@xmath19 ) flattens , consistent with a half - peak surface brightness / density ( core ) radius of @xmath140.34 @xmath20 0.2 pc ( genzel et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the value of the core radius is uncertain .",
    "the lower limit comes from surface density counts of the brightest few hundred stars ( eckart et al .",
    "the upper limit comes from the surface brightness distribution of late type stars ( allen 1994 ) , and measurements of the integrated light of faint stars in between the brightest stars ( rieke & rieke 1994 ) . the largest concentration of k@xmath21 stellar light and surface density is not centered on sgra@xmath13 , but on the irs16 complex about 2@xmath22 east of it .",
    "this offset has been interpreted as evidence that sgra@xmath13 can not be a massive black hole ( e.g. allen & sanders 1986 ) .",
    "second , there are several different stellar populations / components in the central parsec ( for a review see genzel 2001 ) .",
    "the stellar mass and the near - ir light at k@xmath23 is dominated by red giants in the old ( 1 - 10 gyr ) component of the nuclear star cluster .",
    "a group of about a dozen luminous , blue supergiants ( ` hei emission line stars ' ) strongly affects the near - ir maps at the bright end ( k@xmath24 ) , and probably indicates recent formation of massive stars within the last 2 - 7 myrs ( forrest et al .",

    "1996b , paumard et al . 2001 ) . a number of bright ( k@xmath25 ) asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars sample an intermediate mass , intermediate age component ( @xmath26100 myr , lebofsky & rieke 1987 , krabbe et al .",
    "1995 , blum et al .",
    "finally there is a group of dust embedded stars with near - featureless near - ir spectra ( becklin et al .",
    "1978 , krabbe et al .",
    "1995 , genzel et al .",
    "1996 ) , many of which are associated with the gaseous mini - spiral ( lo & claussen 1983 ) .",
    "their nature is uncertain .",
    "the near - ir luminosity function to k@xmath2716 resembles that of the galactic bulge in baade s window ( blum et al .",
    "1996a , davidge et al .",
    "1997 , alexander & sternberg 1999 ) .",
    "third , the mean stellar velocities ( or velocity dispersions ) follow a kepler law ( @xmath28 ) from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , and provide compelling evidence for the presence of a central compact mass ( genzel et al .",
    "1996 , 97 , 2000 ; eckart and genzel 1996 , 97 ; ghez et al .",
    "overall the stellar velocities are consistent with an isotropic velocity field but the hei emission line stars appear to be preferentially on tangential orbits ( genzel et al .",
    "statistical modeling of the stellar velocity data ( projected mass estimators , jeans equation modeling , non - parametric modeling ) imply that the 2 to 3.3@xmath31 central dark mass is concentrated on scales less than ten light days ( eckart & genzel 1996 , 1997 , ghez et al .",

    "( 2003 ) found that the star closest to sgra@xmath13 in 2002 , s2 , is on a highly elliptical keplerian orbit around the radio source .",
    "the enclosed mass within the orbit s peri - center approach of 17 light hours ( in april 2002 : at which point the star had a sky projected velocity of @xmath265000 km / s ) is @xmath32 ( schdel et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is within the uncertainties the same as the mass at distances of ten to several hundred light days . as a result",
    "the density of a hypothetical , non - black hole configuration has to have a central density of 2@xmath33 pc@xmath34 or greater .",
    "when combined with the 8 to 20 km / s upper limit to the proper motion of sgra@xmath35 ( backer & sramek 1999 , reid et al .",
    "1999 , reid et al .",
    "2003b ) and a theoretical analysis of the motion of a black hole in the central star cluster , the density limit increases to @xmath36 pc@xmath34 ( schdel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the new orbital data now definitely exclude a dark cluster of astrophysical objects ( e.g.neutron stars ) , or a ball of 10 - 60 kev fermions as possible configurations of the central mass concentration .",
    "the only non - black hole configuration is a ball of hypothetical , heavy bosons , which would not be stable , however .",
    "the gravitational potential in the central light year of the galactic center thus is almost certainly dominated by a massive black hole associated with sgra@xmath13 .",
    "we would like to better determine the distribution , properties and dynamics of the different stellar components and understand their formation and evolution .",
    "we need to sample the numerous lower mass stars in the nuclear star cluster to determine the overall stellar density distribution and centroid .",
    "theory predicts a number of effects that are unique to the environment of a black hole ( for a review see alexander 2002 ) .",
    "there should be a density ` singularity ' of the star cluster ( a ` stellar cusp ' ) centered on the hole ( bahcall & wolf 1976 , 1977 , young 1980 ) . because of the very dense environment close encounters and direct stellar collisions can occur and alter the stellar distribution , dynamics and population near the hole .",
    "giant stars can be destroyed ( davies & benz 1991 , rasio & shapiro 1990 , davies et al .",
    "1998 , alexander 1999 ) and exotic stars created ( e.g. thorne and zytkow 1975 ) .",
    "given the extensive evidence for hot , massive stars in the central parsec we need to answer how they came into being in the very dense central environment .",
    "we also would like to detect sgra@xmath13 itself in the near-/mid - ir , and place tighter constraints on the accretion flow properties ( melia & falcke 2001 ) .",
    "we will address all these issues in the present paper .",
    "previous data sets from the 3.5 m eso new technology telescope ( ntt : eckart & genzel 1996 , 1997 , genzel et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) , the 3.6 m canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht : davidge et al .",
    "1997 ) , and from the 10 m keck telescope ( ghez et al . 1998 , 2000 ) have fwhm resolutions of 0.15@xmath37 , 0.16@xmath22 and 0.05@xmath22 respectively , and reach to k@xmath2716 - 17 .",
    "deeper imaging at the diffraction limited resolution of 8 - 10 m class telescopes is critical for addressing the problems outlined above . for this purpose",
    "we have carried out deep near - infrared adaptive optics ( ao ) observations with the new naos / conica instrument on the eso vlt ( lenzen et al .",
    "1998 , rousset et al .",
    "1998 , brandner et al . 2002 ) .",
    "these observations provide diffraction limited images at h ( 1.65@xmath38 and k@xmath39 ( 2.16@xmath38 to @xmath40 and at l@xmath41(3.76@xmath38 to @xmath42 .",
    "these improvements are largely due to the near - infrared wavefront sensor of naos ( which can lock on the bright star irs7 within a few arcsec of sgra * ) and due to the fact that the galactic center passes through the zenith at paranal . as a result naos / conica achieves diffraction limited imaging with stable and high ( 40 - 50% ) , k - band strehl ratios .",
    "proper motions and radial velocities for about 1000 stars are now available from a new analysis of the eso - ntt proper motions and integral field spectroscopy between 1992 and 2003 ( ott et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we combine the ao observations with the new data base of stellar proper motions and radial velocities , for a new analysis of the properties of the nuclear star cluster .",
    "the observations presented in this paper were carried out during science verification with the naos / conica adaptive optics system / near - infrared camera at the unit telescope 4 ( yepun ) of the eso vlt in paranal , chile .",
    "h - band ( 1.65@xmath38 , k@xmath39-band ( 2.16@xmath43 m ) and @xmath44-band ( 3.76@xmath43 m ) imaging data were taken on august 29 , 2002 .",
    "seeing was between 0.5 and 0.6@xmath22 . for h  and k@xmath39 the infrared wavefront sensor of naos",
    "was used to close the feedback loop on the bright supergiant irs 7 @xmath45 north of sgra@xmath13 .",
    "the detector pixel scale was 0.0132@xmath22/pixel for h and k@xmath39 and 0.027@xmath46/pixel for l@xmath41 .",
    "the diffraction limited resolution was 40 , 55 and 95 milliarcseconds ( mas ) in the h , k@xmath39 and l@xmath41 bands ( fwhm ) .",
    "the oversampling helped to reduce the saturation of the numerous bright sources in the nuclear cluster .",
    "the detector integration time was 15 s. four individual exposures were combined by a pipeline into one image of 60 s integration time .",
    "25 such images were taken in the h band and 20 in the k@xmath47-band .",
    "the individual images were flat - fielded , sky - subtracted and corrected for dead / bad pixels .",
    "the final frames were co - added with a simple shift - and - add ( ssa ) algorithm to final images of 1200 s ( k@xmath39 band , figure 1 ) and 1500 s ( h band , figure  2 ) total integration time . the strehl ratio measured on individual sources near the guiding star is @xmath48 in the k@xmath39-band and @xmath49 in the h band . dithering between the exposures resulted in a field - of - view ( fov ) larger than the @xmath50 provided by conica with the finest pixel scale .",
    "from the final mosaic we selected a @xmath51 region with the highest s / n - ratio , approximately centered on sgra@xmath52 .",
    "there are numerous ( @xmath53 ) bright ( k@xmath54 ) stars in the fov , which are strongly saturated in the k@xmath39-band image .",
    "saturation is less severe in the h - band image .",
    "for l the ao loop was closed with the visible light wavefront sensor on a @xmath55 star @xmath56 to the north - east of sgra@xmath13 ( at the time of the observations the dichroic allowing the simultaneous use of the infrared wavefront sensor and the l / m - bands was not available ) .",
    "a single imaging frame consists of 150 exposures of 0.2 s , coadded by a pipeline into a single frame with 30 s integration time .",
    "76 such images were taken .",
    "after flat fielding , sky - subtraction and dead / bad pixel correction , the individual frames were combined into a final ssa image of 2280 s integration time , with a strehl ratio of @xmath48 ( see also clnet et al .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows a color composite of all three images .    in the following subsections we discuss in detail the analysis and methods we have developed and applied to carry out source counts , photometry and astrometry in our crowded , high dynamic range , adaptive optics images .",
    "readers who wish to skip these technical details should continue with section 3 .      in order to facilitate the identification of sources in the extremely dense nuclear stellar cluster and to reduce the influence of the seeing halos of the numerous bright stars , we deconvolved the images prior to number counts and photometric analysis . a point - spread function ( psf )",
    "was extracted from the images by taking the median of several ( more than 10 in the case of the k@xmath39 and h - band images ) fairly isolated , bright , but not saturated stars .",
    "we deconvolved the images using two methods , a linear wiener - filter technique ( ott , eckart & genzel 1999 ) , and the lucy - richardson ( lr : lucy 1974 ) algorithm .",
    "the delta maps resulting from the lr deconvolution were re - convolved with a gaussian psf of the appropriate fwhm for the respective wavelengths .",
    "for comparison of the results of the different image processing techniques , figure 2 shows the direct ( ssa ) image , and the wiener - filtered / linearly deconvolved and the lucy - deconvolved h - band images of the central @xmath57 around the compact radio source sgra@xmath13 .",
    "the agreement of sources identified with the different image analysis techniques is generally very good . only within a few tenths of an arcsec of bright ( mostly saturated )",
    "stars some deterioration is caused by artefacts such as ringing . in these regions ,",
    "graininess of the seeing halo , ringing and streaks make source identification of stars 4 or more magnitudes fainter than the bright star unreliable .",
    "figure 3 shows h- , k@xmath39-  and l@xmath58-band , lucy - deconvolved images of the central region around sgra@xmath52 .",
    "we identified point sources and carried out photometry with the find procedure from the idl astrolib library .",
    "the idl find procedure convolves the image with a gaussian beam prior to searching for local maxima .",
    "we found that there is no ideal choice for this parameter .",
    "depending on the exact value of the fwhm parameter , sources may be identified or missed in densely packed regions , while various spurious sources may be detected .",
    "we therefore decided to repeat the source detection ( and completeness correction , see below ) procedure three times , with different values of the fwhm parameter . for construction of the final source lists we compared the lists of sources from the lr and wiener deconvolved images , eliminating sources that only showed up in one of the lists . for the remaining stars ,",
    "their photometric values were averaged , with the error taken as the deviation of the two measurements from the average .",
    "the photometric errors for the different bands are shown in figure 4 . in regions not too close to bright stars , sources of 19th magnitude are @xmath59 above the background in the deconvolved k@xmath39-band image , while the h -band image is about 1.5 magnitudes deeper .",
    "spurious sources are detected in the seeing halos of bright stars .",
    "this problem was particularly important for the k@xmath39-band , where numerous bright stars were strongly saturated .",
    "deconvolution techniques also tend to create faint , spurious point sources .",
    "we therefore adopted a conservative approach by applying the constraint that genuine stellar sources must be present in both the h- and k@xmath39-band image .",
    "we verified that this procedure effectively excluded spurious detections by comparing the maps of the identified stars with the actual images .",
    "the final lists of sources comprise between 3200 and 4000 stars , depending on the choice of the fwhm parameter , with significantly different source counts only for sources with k@xmath6018 .",
    "after correction for incompleteness ( see below ) , however , the number counts at all magnitudes agree very well . for the number counts of the luminosity function and of the surface number density presented in this paper , we chose the average of the counts resulting from the different choices of the fwhm parameter .",
    "for the errors , we combined quadratically the statistical counting ( poisson ) error and the maximum deviation of the counts from their average , which corresponds to a @xmath1410% uncertainty at k@xmath61 .",
    "we calibrated the photometry in the h , k@xmath39 and l@xmath41 bands relative to sources in the cluster .",
    "the main limitation in identifying appropriate calibration stars resulted from finding stars that were not saturated , but bright enough to be included in the blum et al .",
    "( 1996a ) list .",
    "additionally , these stars should be fairly isolated because the blum et al .",
    "( 1996a ) data were seeing limited . by considering these points we tried to minimize possible systematic errors in flux calibration .",
    "for the k@xmath39-band image , we chose four isolated stars with magnitudes between 13 and 14 from the ott et al .",

    "we took irs 33n and irs 16cc ( blum et al .",
    "1996a ) to calibrate the l@xmath58-band data .",
    "another point to keep in mind is that the blum et al .",
    "( 1996a ) data are made for the k and l - bands , while the observations presented in this paper were made with l@xmath41 and k@xmath39 band filters .",
    "we estimate the resulting relative uncertainties of our photometry to be less than 0.1 mag at k@xmath6218 ( h@xmath2719 ) , while the absolute photometry is uncertain by 0.15 mag in h and k@xmath39 , and 0.3 mag at l@xmath58 .",
    "we determined the incompleteness correction for the k@xmath39-band images with the well known technique of first adding and then again recovering artificial stars . taking the same psf",
    "as used for deconvolution , we inserted artificial stars randomly into the original stellar field .",
    "the image containing the artificial stars was wiener deconvolved , followed by source identification with the find procedure .",
    "we did not repeat this procedure with a lr deconvolution because of the enormous amount of computational time needed for this method .",
    "the artificial stars were spaced at intervals of @xmath63 , such that their individual psfs did not interfere with each other . by repeating the same procedure many times with different positions for the artificial stars",
    ", we probed the image with artificial stars in a dense @xmath64 grid .",
    "we recorded in completeness maps the probability of recovering a source with a given magnitude at a given position .",
    "the completeness map for stars of 18th magnitude in the k@xmath39-band image is shown in fig.5 .",
    "its spatial structure of course reflects the distribution of bright stars in fig.1 .",
    "table 1 gives the overall completeness as well as the average magnitude and standard deviation of the magnitude of the recovered artificial stars for each magnitude interval .",
    "we determined the completeness corrections for all three choices of the find fwhm parameter that were used to create the source lists .      in order to obtain astrometric positions for the stars",
    "relative to sgr a * , we aligned the infrared images , in which the stars are observed , with the astrometrically accurate radio images , in which sgra@xmath13 is observed ( schdel et al .",

    "this assumption is almost certainly violated at some level , since we argue below that giant late type stars are destroyed and moderately massive stars are created by mergers of lower mass stars in the very dense inner region .",
    "however , we expect that these effects alter mostly the counts of the less numerous , brighter stars and not so much the fainter stars that dominate the counts . at the very least ,",
    "the radial population changes make the values of the cusp density estimated above quite uncertain .",
    "obviously , spectroscopic observations will be required for studying the properties of the fainter stars as a function of distance from sgra*.    keeping this caveat in mind , the observed stellar density distribution is consistent within the uncertainties with the predictions of theoretical models for a cluster of stars surrounding a massive central black hole .",

    "the excess can be attributed to old and metal rich , core he - burning horizontal branch ( hb)/red clump ( rc ) stars ( tiede et al . 1995 ) .",

    "in fact , an old ( @xmath14 10 gyr ) , single age ( ssp ) model with a bulge metallicity distribution deduced from the color - magnitude properties of the bulge gives a fairly good representation of the hump ( dashed curve in figs . 9 and 11 , from zoccali et al .",
    "we thus conclude that the hump in the klf at k@xmath12116 is most likely caused by the presence in the innermost parsec of such old low mass , and metal rich stars .",

    ". losing their envelopes well before their helium cores reaches critical mass for helium ignitions , these stars would evolve directly to become helium white dwarfs , skipping the hb / rc phase .",
    "this could account for the absence of the hb / rc hump in the klf and the lower fraction of red giants .",

    "the present data suggest a large fraction of highly eccentric orbits ( schdel et al . 2003 ) . in that case",
    "the number of fast moving stars would be significantly larger .",
    "in fact two such stars ( s2 and s14 ) have already been observed ( schdel et al . 2002 , 2003 , ghez et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the prospects thus are good for using interferometry to sample stars closer to the central black hole than presently possible with ao on 10m - class telescopes .",
    "the total number of unobserved , low mass stars ( 0.5 - 1 m@xmath81 ) extrapolated with the klf - slope , in combination with the mass model of section 3.2 above , can also be used to compute the average stellar mass in the cusp . for @xmath132",

    "alternatively , if the faint - end klf slope remains near the value of @xmath129=0.21 characteristic of the k@xmath6218 data , then the imf must be significantly shallower than a salpeter imf , thus containing more high mass stars .",

    "the early type ( ` s'- ) stars in the ` sgra@xmath13 cluster ' ( @xmath191 ) show a different angular momentum distribution ( fig.12 , right panel ) . keeping in mind that a few of these stars may only be projected to lie in the central arcsecond , the ` sgra@xmath13 cluster ' stars",
    "do not show an excess of tangential orbits . on the contrary , a more detailed analysis shows an excess of radial orbits ( genzel et al .",

    "54 ( @xmath192 ) % of the 35 observed stars in the ` sgra@xmath13 cluster ' are on radial orbits .",
    "these stars are probably observed near the apoapse of their orbit ( roughly twice the semi - major axis ) , where they spend most of their time .",
    "it is therefore likely that the radial stars are tightly bound to the black hole , with semi - major axes of order 20 mpc .",
    "this statistical inference , together with the direct derivation of semi - major axes of @xmath6910 mpc for the 6 stars in the inner cusp whose orbits were solved ( schoedel et al 2003 ) , suggests that the sgr a * cluster as a whole is tightly bound to the black hole .",
    "the orbital planes of those stars , as far as they are constrained by the current data , are significantly different from the two disk planes of the early type stars at @xmath1931  .",
    "for instance s2 has a clockwise angular momentum , but its orbital plane is 70@xmath171 off the plane of the clockwise early type stars discussed above . levin and beloborodov ( 2003 ) have commented that such large offsets may be explained by relativistic lense - thirring precession of a star originally in the same plane as the stars further out .    in summary , we find compelling evidence from different arguments - klf , spectra / narrow - band photometry , dynamics - that the stellar cusp centered on the massive black hole candidate sgra@xmath13 does not primarily consist of old , low mass stars with properties similar to those found in the galactic bulge . late type giants and horizontal branch , red clump stars seem to be less frequent .",
    "the cusp contains a suprising number of unrelaxed and apparently young , massive stars , including the very short lived hei emission line stars with masses 30 - 100 m@xmath81 that reside in two rotating disks .",
    "this result is not consistent with theoretical expectations for a steady - state cusp , which predict that such a cusp should be dynamically relaxed  ( bahcall & wolf 1976 , 1977 , murphy et al .",

    "( 2003 ) indicate that several of the dusty sources indeed are late type , carbon - rich wolf - rayet ( wc ) stars .",

    "the only possible case for dusty stars moving along with the gas of the mini - spiral is the irs13 complex . at the northern tip of the irs13 complex",

    "it is not clear , however , whether irs13/2 is actually part of the large scale , northern arm structure , or whether it is a separate dynamical feature in the bar ( vollmer & duschl 2000 ) .",
    "if massive stars are forming frequently in dense gas streamers when outside the central parsec and then rapidly move through the central region , one would expect @xmath14100 times as many massive stars outside the central region as in the central parsec .",
    "only a few such stars have so far been found in the central 10 pc , although complete surveys have been shallow ( figer 1995 ) and deeper searches were confined to known compact hii regions ( cotera et al .",

    "most of the bright dusty sources associated with the mini - spiral are not embedded ` protostars ' .      to overcome the long time scales implied by two - body relaxation , gerhard ( 2001 ) proposed that a young star cluster spiraled into the nucleus through dynamical friction , and made it to the central parsec before it was tidally disrupted there .",
    "portegies zwart , mcmillan & gerhard ( 2003 ) , have shown by more detailed numerical simulations that the gerhard scenario is feasible .",

    "the in - spiraling cluster maintains its orbital angular momentum direction and the tidally disrupted final remnant of such a cluster resembles a thin rotating disk , similar to what we observe .",

    "( 2003 ) is 1 - 2 pc , significantly larger than the characteristic radius of either one of the two rotating disks of young stars ( 0.1 - 0.4 pc ) .",
    "further , there is presently no observational evidence for such dense ( @xmath228 cm@xmath34 ) , compact and massive molecular concentrations within a few parsec of the nucleus ( mezger et al .",
    "several @xmath230 @xmath222 molecular clouds are located at distances @xmath231 pc from the center ( mezger et al .",
    "1996 ) . at that radius the tidal requirements",
    "are much reduced , although a cluster that formed efficiently from such a cloud must still have been very compact to rapidly core collapse und thus make it intact into the central region . finally the fact that we see two such disks , with different angular momenta , requires that two massive clusters fell in at about the same time ( and none later ) .",
    "this is statistically unlikely .",
    "we conclude that the infalling cluster scenario , while attractive , fails to match the specific properties of the two rotating disks of young stars in the galactic center .",
    "the third possibility is that stars formed in situ from cloud collapse , following the infall of ( a ) dense gas cloud(s ) .",
    "several molecular and ionized gas clouds are detected in the central parsec , several with large radial velocities , and a few even with the correct ( and anti - galactic ) angular momentum ( jackson et al .",
    "1993 , lacy et al .",
    "1991 , genzel et al .",
    "the mass in the presently observed circum - nuclear molecular material is several 10@xmath221 m@xmath81 .",
    "this is amply sufficient to account for the massive star content in the 2 - 7 myr starburst component 1 - 10  from the center ( one to a few thousand solar masses , krabbe et al .",
    ". it may also be sufficient to account for formation of lower mass stars with a salpeter - like , mass function if the star formation efficiency is sufficiently high .",
    "for self - gravity in interstellar clouds to overwhelm the tidal shear and create @xmath232 of stars in the 2 - 7 myr starburst component , however , requires gas densities of 5 to 10@xmath233 hydrogen atoms cm@xmath34 .",
    "this is several thousand times greater than the density of gas clumps currently found in the atomic and molecular gas clouds in the central 1 - 2 pc ( @xmath234 cm@xmath34 , jackson et al .",
    "1993 , genzel et al .",
    "for the ` s'-stars bound to the black hole within the central arcsecond the required gas densities are even more extreme ( @xmath26 10@xmath235 cm@xmath34 ) .",
    "hence gas clumps naturally occuring in known circum - nuclear gas would have to be compressed very substantially before they can collapse to form stars . a cloud - cloud collision and shocks resulting from it , as well as the action on that gas by stellar winds in the central region may be possible agents for achieving such compressions ( morris 1993 ) .",
    "some evidence for large compression and the action of winds come from high resolution radio maps ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "1998 ) and the new naos / conica l@xmath41 images ( fig . 1 , 18 , clnet et al .",
    "the l@xmath41 image exhibits sharp ( diameter @xmath236 ) filaments , plausibly caused by the interaction of the mini - spiral streamers with the outflows and winds from the central few arcseconds .",
    "there are no published simulations of such a cloud collision near a black hole but it is clear qualitatively that the cooling , post - shock material would have lost a lot of its original angular momentum and settle in a disk circulating around the hole .",
    "subsequently the disk could loose additional angular momentum through magnetic friction ( hawley & balbus 2001 ) or interaction with the stellar winds in the central parsec . through that angular momentum transport",
    "the gas disk could then slowly contract and eventually become dense enough in its inner parts to form stars ( e.g. levin and boloborodov 2003 , nayakshin et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we can not quantitatively evaluate this scenario at the present time but conjecture that it has two natural and critical features matching our new observations .",
    "first a cloud collision is a sudden compression that may trigger a burst of star formation .",
    "second the two colliding clouds would plausibly move in rather different directions and would be compressed at the same time , thus leading to coeval star formation in the post - shock gas of both clouds .",
    "if the splashing , shocked gas retains some memory of the original cloud momenta , the gas might settle in two , counter - rotating disks .",
    "we therefore think that the colliding clouds model is qualitatively very attractive for explaining the two counter - rotating and coeval massive star disks 1 - 10  from sgra@xmath35 .",
    "obviously a realistic hydrodynamical simulation of such a cloud collision in the gravitational potential of a massive black hole should be carried out for testing the notion that a cloud collision can lead to two separate rotating disks .",
    "if that turns out to not be the case , one would have to resort to a model in which two clouds happened to fall into the center at the same time , and then gradually lost angular momentum and contracted until they could form stars .",
    "this scenario suffers from the same problem of low statistical probability as for the two in - spiraling star clusters .",
    "another possibility is that the massive stars are continuously formed through mergers of lower mass stars . in this case",
    "the massive early type stars may be old stars that have been rejuvenated in the very dense environment of the cusp ( morris 1993 , genzel et al .",
    "1994 , lee 1994 , alexander 2002 ) .",
    "the probability for massive stars to be formed in this way can be qualitatively assessed by comparing the collision time scale between stars of different masses with their lifetime . since the collisional time scale increases but the stellar lifetime decreases with mass , the maximum stellar mass formed in a merger tree occurs roughly when the two time scales are equal .",
    "as shown analytically in appendix a ,  10 @xmath120 stars can plausibly be formed in this way in the innermost cusp , within a few tenths of an arcsecond of sgra@xmath13 , if the merger efficiency in high velocity collisions is high and if angular momentum of the rapidly rotating merger is efficiently removed .",
    "the ` s'-stars in the ` sgra@xmath13 cluster ' may thus be collisional products .",
    "they may be super - blue stragglers. similar to but much more massive than those found in globular clusters ( bailyn 1995 ) .",
    "however , the more massive ` hei ' emission line stars ( 30 - 100 @xmath120 ) 1 - 12@xmath22 from sgra@xmath13 clearly can not have been formed this way , in agreement with the more detailed fokker - planck calculations of lee ( 1994 ) .",
    "another predicted effect of stellar collisions in the cusp is the destruction of late type giants ( alexander 1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "we show in appendix a that within the central @xmath141@xmath22 near - central collisions occur between late type giants and solar mass stars within a giant s lifetime .",
    "if such collisions permanently destroy the giant s envelope ,  one would expect that the density of late type giants decreases in the central few arcsecs .",
    "we have shown above ( figs .",
    "7 ) that the fraction of k@xmath237 giants in fact appears lower within the central @xmath238 , which is in agreement with the collider model and the earlier conclusions of alexander ( 1999 ) .",
    "we have presented a new analysis of the properties of the star cluster in the central 10  of our milky way ,  based on deep , near - ir adaptive optics imaging with naos / conica on the eso vlt , and a new data base of stellar proper motions .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the faint stars form a power - law cusp centered on the massive black hole sgra@xmath35 .",
    "our observations resolve the long - standing paradox of why the infrared light distribution peaks away from the position of sgra@xmath128 .",
    "the stellar density in the central arcsecond exceeds 3@xmath20210@xmath239m@xmath81pc@xmath34 .",
    "stellar collisions are expected to be frequent .",
    "the shape of the k - band luminosity function of the central par@xmath240 is consistent with the properties of an old , metal rich star cluster , with an admixture of massive young stars .",
    "k - band luminosity function , faint number counts and late type star fraction in the central few arcseconds suggest that stellar content and properties change significantly in the dense innermost cusp . to the k@xmath2715 magnitude limit reached by spectra and proper motions , the cusp is dominated by massive , early type stars .",
    "the k@xmath2715 early type stars , similar to the brightest hei emission line stars studied over the past decade , are dynamically unrelaxed and thus must be young .",
    "most of the early type stars in the central 10 arcseconds appear to reside in two fairly thin , rotating disks .",
    "these disks orbit the black hole , are inclined at large angles and counter - rotate with respect to each other .",
    "the two star disks have essentially the same stellar content and thus must have formed coevally , within less than 1 myr .",
    "5 .   of the various proposals",
    "how the massive stars have made it into the central 1 - 10  our new observations , and in particular the pattern of two coeval rotating disks of massive stars , now appear to favor in situ formation following the collision of gas clouds .",
