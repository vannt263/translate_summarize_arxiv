    "the statistical relation between recorded crime and economic and demographic variables , such as unemployment and the number of young males , is not only of fundamental importance @xcite , but becomes increasingly important in forecasting tools for policy and planning decisions @xcite . as recorded crime and its predictor variables",
    "are generally integrated of order one , two kinds of models exist .",
    "there are short - run models specified in first differences and cointegrated models specified in levels . in a short - run model , crime has a strong stochastic dynamic of its own , eventually drifting away uncontrollably from the relation with its predictors .",
    "conversely , in a cointegrated model , crime fluctuates with constant variability around the relation with its predictors , thereby preserving its importance in the long run . as a consequence ,",
    "cointegrated models are to be favored over short - run models when making long term forecasts . theoretically , given a set of predictor variables",
    ", one can not argue conclusively whether a cointegrated model applies .",
    "empirically , however , a time series analysis indicates whether a cointegrated model is supported by the data or not @xcite .",
    "for example , no cointegration was found between crime and unemployment in england and wales @xcite , while a cointegrated relation was established between robbery rate and divorce rate in the united states @xcite .",
    "the objective of this work is to go beyond a time series analysis for a fixed set of predictor variables .",
    "rather , we consider all subsets of a set of potential predictor variables and search for cointegrated models .",
    "the kind of crime under investigation is violent crime in the netherlands , composed of robbery , assault , homicide , rape and extortion .",
    "the set of potential predictor variables consists of unemployment , the number of males aged 15 - 25 years of western background , the number of males aged 15 - 25 years of non - western background , the number of divorces and deflated consumption .",
    "a manual inspection of all subsets is not feasible because the number of subsets , and thereby the number of candidate models , grows exponentially with the number of potential predictor variables .",
    "even with five potential predictor variables and allowing for a potential error correction parameter , a constant or a constant and a trend , nearly two hundred candidate models exist . to investigate these models",
    ", we developed a modelgenerator that automatically builds and estimates them and subsequently checks for cointegration .",
    "the cointegration check consists of the first step of the engle - granger ( eg ) procedure @xcite .",
    "the generator discards models that are not cointegrated and then estimates the cointegrated models using nls regression .",
    "finally , the generator orders the cointegrated models using the information criterions aic @xcite and bic @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition for the existence of a cointegrated relation is that all variables involved are integrated of the same non - vanishing order .",
    "adf tests @xcite indicate that recorded violent crime and its potential predictor variables do not reject one or more null hypotheses of a unit root up to the 0.10 level .",
    "these tests were performed on annual data ranging from 1978 to 2006 and the detailed results are listed in table [ adfkpss ] .",
    "we also performed kpss tests @xcite that reverse the null hypothesis ( a unit root ) and the alternative hypothesis ( stationarity ) of the adf tests .",
    "the kpss results are included in table [ adfkpss ] .",
    "the probabilities of @xmath0 having a unit root and of @xmath0 being stationary are all rather small ( see table [ adfkpss ] for the symbolic notation of the variables ) .",
    "further analysis reveals that @xmath0 is more likely to be integrated of order two than of order one .",
    "however , based on the joint picture emerging from table [ adfkpss ] , we conclude that all variables ( including @xmath0 ) are integrated of order one .",
    "having met the necessary condition , the following cointegrated model may exist @xmath1 here , @xmath2 denotes discrete time measured in years , @xmath3 is a non - empty subset of the integer set @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the coefficient connecting @xmath6 to @xmath7 and @xmath8 is gaussian white noise . the operator @xmath9 is the backshift operator retarding a variable with one year and the autoregressive noise @xmath10 is stationary and causal with correlation length @xmath11 measured in years .",
    "model ( [ boxjenkins ] ) may be augmented with a constant @xmath12 or a constant and a trend @xmath13 .",
    ".results of adf tests and kpss tests on recorded violent crime and its potential predictor variables .",
    "the lag length of the adf tests is selected with bic .",
    "the numbers in the adf columns are the probabilities of the variable having a unit root .",
    "the subcolumns ` 0 ' , ` c ' and ` ct ' correspond to a random walk around , respectively , zero , a constant and a constant and a trend .",
    "the probabilities are based on finite - sample distributions of the df statistic @xcite of ref .",
    "the kpss tests are performed with the bartlett kernel and the data - based newey - west bandwidth selection procedure @xcite .",
    "the numbers in the kpss subcolumns ` c ' and ` ct ' are the probabilities of the variable being stationary around , respectively , a constant and a constant and a trend .",
    "these probabilities are based on the asymptotic test statistics of ref .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ shortrunest ]    the predictive power of short - run models i and iii is compared to that of cointegrated model ii by in - sample forecasts .",
    "the outcome of the comparison is not known beforehand : @xmath14 may be a good predictor of @xmath7 and the short - run models can outperform the cointegrated model when making short term forecasts .",
    "we make a long ( short ) term forecast , estimating the models using data from 1978 up to 1995 ( 2000 ) and forecasting them from 1996 ( 2001 ) to 2006 .",
    "the forecasts are based on a monte carlo simulation of @xmath15 repetitions ( including coefficient uncertainty ) and consist of mean forecasts and error bounds .",
    "the results for short - run model i and the cointegrated model are indicated in fig .",
    "[ forecasts ] .",
    "panel ( a ) holds the long term forecasts and indicates that the cointegrated model outperforms the short - run model in the sense that its mean predictions are closer to the realizations and that its error bounds are smaller . in panel ( b ) , holding the short term forecasts , the mean forecasts of the models are very similar , but the error bounds of the short - run model are larger .",
    "the forecasts of short - run model iii are similar to that of short - run model i. in panel ( a ) , short - run model iii would produce mean forecasts a bit worse than that of short - run model i. in panel ( b ) , it would produce mean forecasts a bit closer to the realizations than that of short - run model i and the cointegrated model .",
    "the error bounds of short - run model iii are comparable to that of short - run model i.",
    "we have developed a modelgenerator that searches for cointegrated models among candidate models specified in levels .",
    "the generator employs the first step of the eg procedure to decide whether a model is cointegrated or not .",
    "subsequently , it estimates the cointegrated models with nls regression and checks the residuals with the bg lm test .",
    "finally , it orders models according to both aic and bic .",
    "the generator is applied to recorded violent crime and five potential predictor variables : unemployment , the number of males aged 15 - 25 years of western background , the number of males aged 15 - 25 years of non - western background , the number of divorces and deflated consumption .",
    "the pattern emerging from the ordered list of cointegrated models is that the number of males aged 15 - 25 years of non - western background and deflated consumption are the key predictors of recorded violent crime .",
    "based on an analysis of vec models , a plausibility argument and the statistical significance of estimated parameters , we select a cointegrated model out of the ordered list .",
    "the selected model holds , in addition to the key predictors , the number of males aged 15 - 25 years of western background .",
    "with the cointegration check switched off , the generator is used to find short - run models specified in first differences .",
    "the key predictors of the short - run models are the number of males aged 15 - 25 years of non - western background and the number of divorces . based on a plausibility argument and the statistical significance of estimated parameters ,",
