    "in our two companion papers @xcite , we report accurate measurements of the distance , black hole mass and orbital inclination angle for the black - hole binary system cygnus x-1 .",
    "herein , we use these results to determine the spin of the black hole primary by fitting the thermal component of its x - ray spectrum to our implementation of the novikov - thorne model of a thin accretion disk  @xcite .",
    "cygnus x-1 was discovered at the dawn of x - ray astronomy @xcite and is one of the brightest and most persistent celestial x - ray sources .",
    "its compact primary was the first object to be established as a black hole via dynamical observations @xcite . for several decades",
    ", the source has been extensively observed at radio , optical , ultraviolet and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "cygnus x-1 is typically in a hard spectral state , but occasionally it switches to a soft state , which may persist for up to a year ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it is only in this soft state , when the disk spectrum is prominent , that one can measure the spin using the continuum - fitting method we employ . in this soft state , which corresponds to the steep power - law ( spl ) state ,",
    "a strong compton component is always present .",
    "although cygnus x-1 has been observed on thousands of occasions , it has never been observed to reach the thermal dominant ( td ) state , the state that is most favorable for the measurement of spin via the continuum - fitting method @xcite .",
    "following the pioneering work of @xcite , we measure black hole spin by estimating the inner radius of the accretion disk @xmath3 . in this approach to measuring spin",
    ", one identifies @xmath4 with the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit @xmath5 , which is predicted by general relativity .",
    "@xmath5 is a monotonic function of the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath6 , decreasing from 6  gm / c@xmath7 to 1  gm / c@xmath7 as spin increases from @xmath8 to @xmath9 @xcite with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the black hole mass and angular momentum . ] .",
    "this relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath5 is the foundation for measuring spin by either the continuum - fitting method @xcite or by the fe  k@xmath14 method @xcite .",
    "the identification of @xmath4 with @xmath5 is strongly supported by the abundant empirical evidence that the inner radius of the disk in the soft state of a black hole binary does not appear to change even as the temperature and luminosity change .",
    "lmc  x-3 is a prime example ; its inner - disk radius has been shown to be stable to several percent over a period of 26 years @xcite .",
    "strong theoretical support for identifying @xmath4 with @xmath15 is provided by magnetohydrodynamic simulations of thin accretion disks , which show the disk emission falling off rapidly inside the isco @xcite .    in our early work on measuring spin",
    ", we relied solely on td - state data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , using our empirical model of comptonization simpl @xcite , we have shown that one can obtain values of the inner disk radius using spl data that are consistent ( within @xmath165% ) with those obtained using td data if the scattering fraction is the fraction of the thermal seed photons that are scattered into the power - law tail , and it is the normalization parameter of our xspec model simpl / simplr ( see section  3.2 ) . ] @xmath17% @xcite .",
    "consequently , we are now able to routinely and reliably obtain spin estimates for sources in the spl state @xcite if the scattering fraction is not too extreme",
    ". this development has paved the way for measuring the spin of cygnus x-1 , which has never been observed in the td state .    for the continuum - fitting method to succeed , it is essential to have an accurate value for the black hole mass @xmath11 in order to express the radius appropriately as the dimensionless quantity @xmath18 . for the method to succeed , it is furthermore essential to know the disk luminosity , and therefore to have accurate values for the distance @xmath19 and the disk inclination angle @xmath20 , which we infer by assuming that the orbital angular momentum vector and black - hole spin axis are aligned ( see section  7.4 ) .",
    "we measured these three critical parameters in a two - step process : firstly , using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , we determined a model - independent distance via trigonometric parallax that is accurate to 6% : @xmath21  kpc @xcite . secondly , using this accurate distance estimate to constrain the radius of the companion star , we then modeled an extensive collection of optical data . for our favored asynchronous model , model @xmath22",
    ", we find : @xmath23 and @xmath24 deg @xcite .",
    "with the values of these three input parameters in hand , and using three soft - state x - ray spectra , we determined the spin of cygnus x-1 ; our final value is presented in section  6 .",
    "spin measurements have previously been obtained using the continuum - fitting method for eight black holes @xcite .",
    "three have low to moderate spins , @xmath25 ; four have high spins , @xmath26 ; and one of them , the archetypal microquasar grs  1915 + 105 @xcite , is a near - extreme kerr hole with @xmath27 @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we discuss our observations and the selection and reduction of the x - ray spectral data .",
    "the analysis of these data and our results are presented respectively in sections  3 and 4 for our adopted model , and the robustness of these results is discussed in section  5 .",
    "( additional analysis work and results for several preliminary models are presented in the appendices . ) in section  6 , we first determine the error in the spin parameter due to the combined uncertainties in @xmath19 , @xmath11 , @xmath20 and the absolute flux calibration , and we then present our final value of @xmath13 and confidence limits .",
    "seven distinct topics are addressed in section 7 , and in section 8 we offer our conclusions .",
    "there exist very few spectra of cygnus x-1 that are suitable for the measurement of the black hole s spin for reasons we now discuss .",
    "a typical soft - state ( and spl ) spectrum is comprised of three principal elements : a thermal component , a power - law component , and a reflected component , which includes the fe  k@xmath14 emission line .",
    "three such spectra are analyzed in detail and illustrated in section  3 .",
    "it is apparent from an inspection of these spectra that the spectral coverage must extend to at least 30  kev in order to constrain the strong power - law and reflection components . at the same time , because the temperature of the thermal component is consistently low ( @xmath28  kev ; appendix  a ) , one also requires coverage down to @xmath29  kev in order to constrain this crucial thermal component , which is partially absorbed at low energies by intervening gas .",
    "the rarity of spectra that meet these requirements became clear to us following our exhaustive search of the thousands of spectra of cygnus x-1 that are contained in the heasarc data archive .",
    "to our surprise , we found only a single spectrum , sp1 ( table  1 ) , that is suitable for the measurement of black hole spin .",
    "it was obtained on 30 may 1996 in an observation made simultaneously using the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) _ and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte)_.    there is a second , important reason for the paucity of suitable spectra , namely that cygnus x-1 is seldom in the required disk - dominated state .",
    "this fact is illustrated in figure  1 , which summarizes the behavior of cygnus x-1 since 1996 as observed using the _ rxte _ all - sky monitor ( asm ) .",
    "as indicated in the figure , we select only those data for which the spectral hardness sh @xmath30 , which occurs @xmath31% of the time .",
    "fortunately , cygnus x-1 entered its soft state in mid-2010 , and we obtained two additional broadband spectra on 22 july and 24 july 2010 by making simultaneous observations using the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and _ rxte _ ( table  1 ) .",
    "the times of these two observations and the _ asca / rxte _ observation are indicated by arrows in figure  1 , and the corresponding asm measures of intensity and spectral hardness are plotted as red stars .",
    "detailed information on these three observations is summarized in table  1 .",
    "three spectra were derived from these observations : the 1996 archival _ asca / rxte _ spectrum sp1 , and the two _ chandra / rxte _ spectra , sp2 and sp3 , which were obtained in 2010 .",
    "we first focus on spectrum sp1 , which has been described in detail by others @xcite .",
    "we include in our analysis all of the data collected by both _",
    "asca _ and _ rxte _ , even though the observations were strictly simultaneous for only about 1000  s. this is a reasonable approach because both missions show that the source intensity was stable during the entire observing period ( see figure  4 in * ? ? ? * ) . for _ asca",
    "_ , we consider only data collected by the second gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) detector , gis2 ( the gis3 data were excluded because of an unexplained residual feature in the spectrum near 1  kev ) .",
    "we disregard the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) data because of data - rate limitations . for _ rxte",
    "_ , we use all of the data collected by all five proportional counter array ( pca ) detectors . for the main analysis",
    ", we disregard the _ rxte _ high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) data because the useful bandwidth of the pca , which extends to 45 kev , already provides more than adequate energy coverage .",
    "we demonstrate this fact in section  5.2 where we show that the inclusion of hexte data has no significant affect on our results .",
    "the gis spectra were extracted following the standard procedures described in the _ asca _ data reduction guide .",
    "the gis2 spectrum was fitted over the energy range 0.78.0 kev .",
    "we did not correct the effective area of the detector because the instrument team had already done this calibration to an accuracy of 3% using the standard crab spectrum @xcite .",
    "we reduced the _ rxte _",
    "pca data following the same procedures described in @xcite .",
    "data reduction was performed with standard tools from the heasoft package provided by nasa .",
    "the critical steps in determining the pca background and making the response files for spectral analysis utilized heasoft version 6.10 .",
    "x - ray spectra were extracted from the standard 2 telemetry mode , which provides coverage of the full pca bandpass every 16 s. data from all xe gas layers of pcu-2 were combined to make each spectrum . the background spectrum was determined with the `` bright source '' model .",
    "redistribution matrix files and ancillary response files were freshly generated individually for each pcu layer and then combined into a single response file using the tool _",
    "pcarsp_. we used the pca response matrices v11.7 released on 2009 august 17 , which allowed us to obtain reliable fits over the energy range 2.5545.0 kev .",
    "we corrected for the effective area of the pca using the spectrum of the crab nebula as a standard source and using our recently - adopted and improved method , which is described in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we compared the crab spectrum of @xcite ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) to parameters obtained by analyzing proximate archival observations of the crab . in this way",
    ", we determined a pair of correction factors for spectrum sp1 : a normalization correction factor @xmath34 ( the ratio of the observed normalization to that of toor & seward ) and a correction to the slope of the power law , @xmath35 ( the difference between the observed value of @xmath36 and that of @xcite ) .",
    "these corrections were applied in all of our analysis work via a custom xspec multiplicative model crabcor .",
    "we also corrected the detector count rates for dead time by the factor 1.048 .",
    "we turn now to the recent _ chandra / rxte _ observations ( table  1 ; spectra sp2 and sp3 ) .",
    "the observations performed by the two spacecraft were mostly simultaneous , overlapping for about 4 ks , while the total duration of each _ chandra _ observation was @xmath37  ks . because the source intensity for both observations was constant to within 10% , we included in our analysis all of the _ chandra _ data , plus the strictly simultaneous _",
    "pca data .",
    "our _ chandra _ observations were made using the high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ) and the advanced camera for imaging and spectroscopy ( acis ) @xcite .",
    "the data - rate limitation of the detectors makes it challenging to observe a bright and variable source like cygnus  x-1 .",
    "the principal problem is `` pile - up , '' i.e. , the registering of two or more photons in the same or adjacent pixels within a single frame time . given the uncertainties , and as a hedge , we performed the pair of _ chandra _ observations using two different instrumental configurations , timed exposure ( te ) mode and continuous clocking ( cc ) faint mode , which have contrasting virtues and limitations .    in reducing the _ chandra _ te - mode data",
    ", we followed the method described by  @xcite . in order to avoid saturating the telemetry , only the data for the high energy grating ( heg ; -1 order ) and medium energy grating ( meg ; + 1 order ) components of the hetg were recorded .",
    "the data for the readout streak on the same side of the heg and meg spectra were also recorded .",
    "we extracted the `` streak '' and background spectra following the recommended procedures .",
    "although the net exposure time for the hetg spectrum is 2.15  ksec , the effective exposure time for the streak spectrum is only about 8  sec . for this spectrum",
    ", we estimate that less than 3% of the events are affected by pile - up , and we therefore use the full 0.510  kev bandwidth . for the dispersed grating spectrum ,",
    "we only included data for which @xmath38% of the events are piled up ; for the heg and meg respectively these data are in the energy ranges 0.70.9  kev and 7.010.0  kev .    in the cc mode , the frame time",
    "is reduced to about 3  ms ( compared to 1.3 s for the te mode ) by continuously transferring the data from the image array to the frame - store array . while this essentially eliminates pile - up , the details of the spatial distribution in the columns",
    "are then lost due to the collapse of the 2d image into a 1d image .",
    "again , only the orders of the heg and meg spectra mentioned above were recorded .",
    "the spectra were extracted following the standard procedures .",
    "we fitted these data over the full energy range 0.510.0  kev , except for the 1.32.0 kev chip gap in the meg spectrum .",
    "a downside of the cc mode is that its calibration is less certain than that of the te mode .    for _ rxte",
    "_ , lacking data from all five proportional counter units ( pcus ) , we elected to use only the data from what historically has been the best - calibrated detector , pcu2 .",
    "( one obtains essentially the same results for the _ chandra / rxte _ spectra using any combination of the available pcus ; likewise , for the _ asca / rxte _ spectrum , it is unimportant whether one uses all pcus , as we did , or pcu2 alone . ) as described above , we corrected the effective area of the detector . for both observations ,",
    "the normalization correction is @xmath39 , and the power - law slope correction is @xmath40 .",
    "the dead time corrections for sp2 and sp3 are respectively 1.052 and 1.044 .",
    "finally , we included systematic errors in the count rates in each pha channel to account for uncertainties in the instrumental responses : 1% for gis2 and 0.5% for all the pcus .",
    "all the _ chandra _ data were binned to achieve a minimum number of counts per channel of 200 ; no systematic error was included because the statistical error is large .",
    "a typical spectrum of cygnus x-1 is comprised of three principal elements : a thermal component , a power - law component , and a reflected component that includes the fe  k@xmath14 emission line . the structures in the x - ray source that give rise to these components , namely the accretion disk and its corona , are illustrated in figure  2 .",
    "the spectral components themselves , in relation to the total observed spectrum , are shown plotted in figure  3 , which illustrates the results of the relativistic analysis described in this section .",
    "the data analysis and model fitting throughout this paper were performed using xspec ] version 12.6.0 @xcite and , unless otherwise indicated , errors are everywhere reported at the @xmath41 level of confidence . in this section ( and throughout appendices a and b ) , we fix the key input parameters @xmath19 , @xmath11 and @xmath20 at their fiducial values , which are given in section 1 .",
    "our adopted model that is featured below , and upon which all of our results are based , was constructed by working in detail through a progression of seven preliminary models .",
    "we now briefly comment on these models , which are presented in full in appendices a and b.    _ nonrelativistic models : _ the central component of our three nonrelativistic models , models nr1nr3 , is the familiar accretion - disk model component diskbb ] @xcite , which does not include any relativistic effects or the effects of spectral hardening , and which has an inappropriate boundary condition at the disk s inner edge @xcite .",
    "we nevertheless employed diskbb as an exploratory tool because it has been widely used for decades , and it therefore allows us to compare our reduction / analysis results ( for a spectrum of interest ) to published results .",
    "furthermore , this familiar model returns a direct and useful estimate of the temperature at the inner edge of the disk , which we use in order to make comparisons between cygnus x-1 and other black hole binaries .",
    "the details of this nonrelativistic analysis and the satisfying results obtained for model nr3  namely consistent values of the inner - disk radius and temperature for our three spectra  are presented in appendix a.    _ relativistic models : _ similarly , in addition to our adopted relativistic model ( section 3.2 ) , in appendix b we present our analysis and results for four relativistic models , models r1r4 , that are built around our fully relativistic accretion - disk model component kerrbb2 , which we describe below .",
    "this component is a direct replacement for diskbb , returning two fit parameters , namely the spin and the mass accretion rate ( instead of the temperature and radius of the inner disk ) .",
    "the four models progress sequentially in the sense that model  r1 is the most primitive and model  r4 is the most advanced .",
    "this sequence builds toward our adopted model .",
    "we have chosen to present our results for these preliminary relativistic models , in addition to those for our adopted model , because doing so demonstrates that our modeling of the critical thermal component , and the extreme spin it delivers for cygnus x-1 , are insensitive to the details of the analysis .",
    "the model we employ is a culmination of models r1r4 in the sense that it is the most advanced and physically realistic model .",
    "the schematic sketch of the x - ray source in figure  2 illustrates the various model components and their interplay .",
    "the structure of our adopted model , naming all the components that comprise it , is expressed as follows :    @xmath42}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as described in detail below , simplr generates the power - law component using the seed photons supplied by the single thermal component kerrbb2 , while the reflection component is likewise generated in turn by ireflect acting solely on the power - law component ( i.e. , ireflect does not act on the thermal component ) .",
    "furthermore , the model fits for a single value of @xmath13 , which appears as the key fit parameter in three model components : kerrbb2 , kerrdisk and kerrconv .",
    "we now discuss in turn the model s three principal components  thermal , power - law and reflected  and their interrelationships .    _",
    "thermal component : _ the centerpiece of our adopted model is our accretion - disk model kerrbb2 , which includes all relativistic effects , self - irradiation of the disk ( `` returning radiation '' ) and limb darkening @xcite .",
    "the effects of spectral hardening are incorporated into the basic model kerrbb via a pair of look - up tables for the hardening factor @xmath43 corresponding to two representative values of the viscosity parameter : @xmath44 and 0.1 @xcite .",
    "motivated by observational data obtained for dwarf novae @xcite and soft x - ray transients @xcite , and the results of global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations , @xcite , throughout this work we adopt @xmath45 as our fiducial value ; meanwhile , in section  5.4 we examine the effects on our results of using @xmath44 in place of @xmath45 .",
    "the entries in the look - up tables for @xmath43 were computed using both kerrbb and a second relativistic disk model bhspec @xcite .",
    "we refer to the model kerrbb plus this table , and the subroutine that reads it , as kerrbb2 @xcite .",
    "as noted above , the model kerrbb2 has just two fit parameters , namely the black hole spin parameter @xmath13 and the mass accretion rate @xmath46 ( or equivalently , @xmath13 and the eddington - scaled bolometric luminosity , @xmath47 ) .",
    "for the calculations reported in this paper , we included the effects of limb darkening and returning radiation .",
    "we set the torque at the inner boundary of the accretion disk to zero ( as appropriate when @xmath19 , @xmath11 and @xmath20 are held fixed ) , allowed the mass accretion rate to vary freely , and fitted directly for the spin parameter @xmath13 .",
    "_ power - law component : _ the first term in the sum , simplr@xmath48kerrbb2 , models the power - law component and the observed thermal component in combination .",
    "this dominant part of the spectrum ( see figure  3 ) is computed by convolving kerrbb2 , which describes the seed photon distribution ( i.e. , the thermal component prior to being scattered ) , with simplr .",
    "the convolution model simplr is a slightly modified version of simpl @xcite that is appropriate when including a separate and additive reflection component @xcite .",
    "the parameters of simplr ( and simpl ) are the power - law photon index @xmath36 and the scattered fraction , @xmath49 , which is the fraction of the seed photons that are scattered into the power - law tail .",
    "as used here , simplr describes a corona that sends approximately half the scattered seed photons outward toward the observer and the remainder downward toward the disk , thereby generating the reflected component ( see below ) .",
    "thus , we assume that the power - law component illuminating the disk is the same as the component we observe .",
    "_ reflected component : _ the second and third terms in the sum model the reprocessed emission from the disk that results from its illumination by the power - law component .",
    "the model for the illuminating power - law component itself ( the term on the far right ) is simplc , which is equivalent to simplr@xmath48kerrbb2 minus the unscattered thermal component @xcite .",
    "this power - law component is acted on by ireflect , which is a convolution reflection model with the same properties as its widely - used parent , the additive reflection model pexriv @xcite .",
    "concerning ireflect , we ( i ) free the reflection scaling factor in ireflect ( and pexriv ) is linked to the reflection constant parameter @xmath50 in simplr via the relation @xmath50=1+@xmath51 ( where @xmath51 is the absolute value of @xmath52 ) . in the limiting case of @xmath53 , half of the scattered photons",
    "are redirected downward and illuminate the disc . in the limiting case of @xmath54 , none of the compton - scattered photons strike the disc @xcite . for the preliminary models described in the appendices that use the additive model pexriv , the scaling factor @xmath52 is fixed at -1.]@xmath52 while restricting its range to negative values , thereby computing only the reflected spectrum , while assuming that the corona is a thin slab that hugs the disk and emits isotropically ; ( ii ) set the elemental - abundance switch to unity , which corresponds to solar abundances , while allowing the iron abundance to be free ; ( iii ) link the photon index to the value returned by simplr ; and ( iv ) fix the disk temperature at @xmath55 k , the temperature @xmath56 returned by diskbb ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the model ireflect@xmath48simplc returns a reflected spectrum that contains sharp absorption features and no emission lines . to complete the model of the reflected component , we follow @xcite and employ the line model kerrdisk and the convolution smearing model kerrconv , both of which treat @xmath13 as a free fit parameter .",
    "these models allow the emissivity indices to differ in the inner and outer regions of the disk . for simplicity , and",
    "because this parameter is unknown with values that vary widely from application to application , we use an unbroken emissivity profile with a single index @xmath57 .",
    "we tie together all the common parameters of kerrdisk and kerrconv , including the two principal parameters , namely @xmath13 and @xmath57 .",
    "the three multiplicative model components are , respectively , ( 1 ) crabcor , which corrects for detector effects ( see section  2 ) ; ( 2 ) const , which reconciles the calibration differences between the detectors ( throughout the paper , we fix the normalization of the _ rxte_/pcu2 detector and float the normalization of the _ asca _ gis and _ chandra _ hetg / acis detectors ) ; and ( 3 ) tbabs% ) that tbabs returns compared to phabs . ] , which models low - energy absorption @xcite .",
    "concerning tbabs , throughout the paper we allow @xmath58 to vary because the column density is well - determined by the data and @xmath58 is known to vary by several percent for all three well - studied supergiant black - hole binaries , namely cygnus x-1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  also see section  4 ) , m33 x-7 @xcite and lmc x-1 @xcite .",
    "the fit results for our adopted model are given in table  [ table : model_5_results ] , and the three fitted spectra together with their spectral components are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the fits are all good , with @xmath59 ranging from 1.17 to 1.28 , and the results in table  [ table : model_5_results ] are in good agreement with those obtained using model  r1r4 ( see appendix  b and tables [ table : model_1_results][table : model_4_results ] ) . as in the case of models  r1r4 ,",
    "the spin parameter is high with @xmath60 for all three spectra .",
    "this is the principal result of this section . in the following section ,",
    "we examine the robustness of this result , and in section  6 we fold in the uncertainties in the input parameters @xmath19 , @xmath11 and @xmath20 and arrive at our final lower limit on @xmath13 .",
    "another parameter of great interest is the scattering fraction , which measures the strength of the compton component : @xmath61% , @xmath62% and @xmath63% for sp1 , sp2 and sp3 , respectively .",
    "these values are high compared to values characteristic of the thermal dominant state ( @xmath64% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is the most favorable state for the measurement of black hole spin .",
    "these large values of @xmath65 , as well as the uniform value of the power - law index ( @xmath66 ) , imply that for all three observations the source was in the steep power - law state @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that one can obtain reliable values of the inner disk radius ( and hence spin ) in the spl state for @xmath67% ( see their figure  1 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the disk component , @xmath68 , is quite low and easily meets our data selection criterion , @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the disk is geometrically very thin at all radii ( the aspect ratio @xmath70 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time , the luminosity is sufficiently high that the spectral hardening factor @xmath43 is well - determined by the data ( @xmath71 ) .    interestingly , for the pair of _ chandra _ observations that are separated by just two days , the values of the fit parameters are quite similar ( table  [ table : model_5_results ] ) with the notable exception of the column density : @xmath72 for sp2 and @xmath73 for sp3 .",
    "we tested whether one can achieve a good fit with a single value of @xmath58 , by fitting the _ chandra / rxte _ spectra jointly , linking only the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "this linking increased the total chi - square by 41 , which corresponds to an f - test probability of @xmath74 .",
    "this low probability implies a significant change in @xmath58 , which is likely due to absorption in the wind of the supergiant companion .",
    "indeed , one expects such absorption in a wind to be larger for sp2 at orbital phase 0.24 than for sp3 at phase 0.61 , as observed ( table  1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this section we consider a number of factors that might affect our results and find that none of them is significant .",
    "we consider the effects of : ( 1 ) excluding the fe  k@xmath14 line and edge features from the fits ; ( 2 ) including hexte data and extending the fits to 150  kev ; ( 3 ) using reflionx to model the reflection component ; and ( 4 ) substituting @xmath44 for our fiducial value of @xmath45 and varying the metallicity .",
    "as shown below , factors ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) have negligible effects on our results , and ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) have slight upward effects on @xmath13 , which implies that the extreme values reported in table  2 are conservative lower limits .",
    "finally ( section 5.5 ) , we explore the effects on our results of artificially relaxing the spin parameter away from its extreme , limiting value by varying the parameters of kerrbb2 ; we find that the input parameters @xmath19 , @xmath11 , and @xmath20 have to be driven far from their fiducial values in order to obtain a spin value as low as @xmath75 .",
    "for all three spectra , we refitted the data excluding the energy range 5.0 - 10.0 kev while omitting the component kerrdisk .",
    "this excised energy range contains the relativistically - broadened fe  k@xmath14 line and edge , as well as a significant residual feature near 9 kev ( figure  3 ) .",
    "for all three spectra , we find that our results are essentially unchanged , apart from small shifts in the parameters of the reflection component .",
    "the results for spectrum sp1 ( only ) are shown in table  3 ( case  2 ) where they are compared to our standard results ( case  1 ) .",
    "thus , we find that the values of the spin parameter returned by the fits are completely determined by the temperature and luminosity of the thermal component and are unaffected by the presence of the line .",
    "this conclusion is reasonable given that the line is a minor feature with an equivalent width of @xmath76  kev , or only @xmath77  kev relative to the continuum at the peak of the thermal component ( see figure  3 ) .      in section  2",
    ", we asserted that the coverage of the pca to 45  kev was sufficient to adequately constrain the power - law and reflection components .",
    "we now demonstrate that this is true by refitting the data for sp1 ( only ) while including the hexte data spanning the energy range 20 kev to 150 kev ( where the source counts are negligible ) . for the hexte data ,",
    "we do not a add a systematic error to the count rates .",
    "however , we do correct the detector response to the crab spectrum of toor & seward ( see section  2 ) using the value of the crab s photon index as measured using hexte : @xmath78 . the slope correction is @xmath79 .",
    "the results obtained using the hexte data , which are given in table  3 ( case  3 ) , are almost identical to our standard results for sp1 ( case  1 ) .",
    "this is not surprising because the pca coverage to 45 kev is more than adequate to determine the slope of the power - law component , and the reflection component is quite weak and dying rapidly at 45  kev ( figure  3 ) .",
    "we replace ireflect@xmath48simplc+kerrdisk with reflionx ] @xcite , which is widely used in measuring spin via the fe  k@xmath14 line .",
    "the merit of this alternative reflection model is that it self - consistently calculates the line feature and the reflection component , whereas ireflect models only the absorption edges .",
    "the downside of reflionx is its description of the seed photon distribution as a simple power - law , which unphysically diverges at low energies ( for further comparison of the two models , see * ? ? ?",
    "we include relativistic blurring by convolving reflionx with kerrconv .",
    "compared to the results given in table  2 , the values of the parameters returned by the fits are generally different , although reasonable , and the fits are somewhat poorer ( @xmath801.351.45 ) .",
    "importantly , the effects on the spin parameter are very small : the value of @xmath13 increases slightly for sp1 ( 0.9985 to 0.9999 ) and is unaffected for sp2 and sp3 , which are at their maximum values .",
    "we refitted the spectra using @xmath44 in place of our fiducial value , @xmath45 .",
    "again , the spin parameter for sp1 increases slightly ( 0.9985 to 0.9988 ) , while the values for sp2 and sp3 remain unchanged . concerning possible metallicity effects",
    ", we do not have nonsolar - metallicity table models for computing spectral hardening for such extreme values of spin .",
    "however , for three sources ( m33 x-7 , @xcite  @xcite ; lmc x-1 , @xcite  @xcite and a062000 , @xcite  @xcite ) , we have found that substantial changes in metallicity produce very small changes in @xmath13 .",
    "for example , reducing the metallicity from solar to a tenth solar decreases the spin parameter of a high - spin black hole like lmc x-1 ( @xmath81 ) by only @xmath82 .",
    "the effect of this same change in metallicity for the slowly - spinning black hole a062000  ( @xmath83 ) is larger , but it is still quite small : @xmath84 .",
    "( the small errors on @xmath13 quoted here come directly from fitting the x - ray spectra , and they do not take into account the uncertainties in @xmath19 , @xmath11 and @xmath20 , which dominate the error budget ) .",
    "we note that the super - solar iron abundances implied by our fits using the reflection models , ireflect ( table  2 ) and pexriv ( appendix b ) , suggest that the metallicity of the cygnus x-1 system is possibly enhanced .",
    "accounting for the supersolar abundances will result in a slightly increased estimate of @xmath13 , so our conclusions are robust to enhanced metallicity .",
    "we now describe three technical exercises that artificially examine the effects of varying three parameters of kerrbb2 , namely , @xmath13 , @xmath19 and the normalization constant @xmath85 ( which we have elsewhere fixed to unity , as is appropriate when @xmath19 , @xmath11 and @xmath20 are specified ) . our motivation is to examine the consequences of relaxing the spin parameter away from the extreme values returned by the fits ( table  2 ) .",
    "first , for spectrum sp1 only , we leave @xmath85 fixed at unity and allow the distance to vary ( keeping @xmath11 and @xmath20 fixed at their fiducial values ) .",
    "for our parallax distance of @xmath86  kpc , we of course have our standard result , @xmath87 ( table  2 ) .",
    "we now arbitrarily and successively fix the spin parameter at two lower values , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and refit spectrum sp1 .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath19 are then substantially greater than our measured value of 1.86  kpc : @xmath90  kpc and @xmath91  kpc , respectively",
    ". meanwhile , the corresponding values of reduced chi - square are respectively 1.34 and 1.40 , which are significantly greater than our standard value of 1.24 ( table  2 ) .",
    "thus , the best fit is achieved for the observed and extreme value of spin .",
    "secondly and alternatively , we obtain similar results by varying @xmath85 while leaving the distance fixed at its fiducial value of 1.86  kpc . for the same pair of forced values of the spin parameter given above ( 0.95 and 0.90 )",
    ", we find for spectrum sp1 that the fitted values of @xmath85 are about half the standard value of unity : @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively ( where a smaller value corresponds to a weaker thermal component ) .",
    "meanwhile , we find values of reduced chi - square that are very similar to those given in the previous example , with values that increase as the spin parameter decreases .",
    "that is , we again find that the best fit is achieved for the observed and extreme value of spin .    in a final experiment",
    ", we assess the consistency of our spin values for the three spectra , which can not be adequately judged by considering the extreme values given in table  2 .",
    "we make this assessment by artificially setting @xmath94 in our adopted model and refitting the three spectra . in this way",
    ", we find best - fit spin values that are in reasonable agreement : @xmath95 for sp1 , @xmath96 for sp2 , and @xmath97 for sp3 .",
    "in all previous work on measuring spin , we have found that the statistical uncertainty in the estimated spin parameter due to the x - ray data analysis is small compared to that due to observational uncertainties in @xmath19 , @xmath11 and @xmath20 . based on our grmhd simulations of thin disks @xcite",
    ", we have likewise found that the uncertainties in these three input parameters dominate over the errors resulting from our use of the analytic novikov - thorne model , which assumes a razor - thin disk . in the case of cygnus x-1 ,",
    "these model errors are especially small because of the extreme spin of the black hole and the low luminosity of the disk .",
    "spin estimates obtained by fitting mock spectra of simulated grmhd disks indicate that for an inclination @xmath98  deg , which is very near the inclination of cygnus x-1 ( @xmath99  deg ) , the novikov - thorne thin - disk model overestimates the spin parameter by only @xmath100 and @xmath101 for spins of 0.90 and 0.98 , respectively ( see table  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , these errors are significantly overestimated because they were computed for disks that are far more luminous ( @xmath102 ) , and hence thicker , than that of cygnus  x-1 ( @xmath103 ) . in our error analysis",
    ", we neglect this small model error .    with the exception of our recent spin measurement of xte j1550564 @xcite , in earlier work",
    "we have neglected the uncertainty in the luminosity due to the @xmath104% uncertainty in the flux of the crab @xcite , an error that uniformly shifts all of our spin measurements either up or down . for the spin of cygnus x-1 , the effect of the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration",
    "is very comparable to the 6% uncertainty in @xmath19 ( which is equivalent to a 12% uncertainty in the measurement of flux ) .",
    "we have therefore included in our error budget the 10% uncertainty in flux ( which we approximate as an uncertainty in the distance of 0.1 kpc ) by simply combining the distance and flux - calibration errors in quadrature , thereby inflating the actual  0.120 kpc distance uncertainty to 0.156  kpc .",
    "thus , the final error we report for @xmath13 includes the uncertainties in @xmath19 , @xmath11 , @xmath20 and the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration . taken together , these four sources of uncertainty totally dominate the error budget .    in order to determine the error in @xmath13 due to the combined uncertainties in @xmath19 , @xmath11 and @xmath20",
    ", we performed monte carlo simulations using the odyssey computing cluster at harvard university .",
    "the latter two parameters are not independent .",
    "they are related through the expression for the mass function : @xmath105sin@xmath106 = @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the mass of the secondary star and the value of the mass function was evaluated using a k - velocity of @xmath109 and an orbital period of @xmath110 days @xcite .    in the analysis",
    ", we assumed that the value of the mass function , the inclination , and the mass of the secondary are normally and independently distributed , and we computed the mass of the black hole using the values of these quantities , which are given above .",
    "we conservatively fixed the viscosity parameter at its baseline value , @xmath45 ( using @xmath44 increases @xmath13 ; see section  5.4 ) .",
    "specifically , we ( i ) generated 9000 parameter sets for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 ; ( ii ) solved for @xmath11 for a given triplet of values of @xmath20 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 ; ( iii ) computed for each set the look - up table for the spectral hardening factor @xmath43 using the model bhspec ; and ( iv ) obtained @xmath13 by fitting our adopted model to the spectra .",
    "the final histogram distributions for our three spectra are shown in figure  4 .",
    "consulting these histograms , we see that the spin estimate is lowest for sp1 , and we conservatively base our final result on this spectrum , _ thereby concluding that @xmath0 at the @xmath113 level of confidence ( see figure  4 and the bottom line of table  2 ) . _    we note the following two caveats : first , the power - law component is strong relative to the thermal component , which decreases the reliability of the continuum - fitting method @xcite .",
    "second , as we discuss in section  7.4 , the continuum - fitting method assumes that the spin vector of the black hole is aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "our wide - ranging discussion covers seven topics : ( 1 ) we first confront the challenge posed by a grossly discrepant spin result that was obtained using the fe - line method ( while noting a concordant fe - line result that appeared very recently ) , and ( 2 ) a second discrepant result obtained using a qpo method .",
    "( 3 ) we next consider a disfavored dynamical model that implies a less extreme value of spin . ( 4 ) the fundamental assumption of the continuum - fitting method , namely the alignment of the spin and orbital vectors , is then considered .",
    "( 5 ) the extreme spin of the black hole is reconciled with the low temperature of its accretion disk .",
    "( 6 ) we find no evidence in our _ chandra _ hetg spectra for warm absorbing gas , and we show that , if it were present , its effects on our spin estimates would be negligible . ( 7 ) finally , we discuss some consequences of the extreme spin of cygnus x-1 , and we argue that this spin is chiefly natal in origin .      based on an analysis of the fe  k@xmath14 line profile , @xcite found marginal evidence for high spin using the same _ asca _ spectrum of cygnus x-1 that we use .",
    "subsequently , however , @xcite reported a spin of @xmath114 based on an analysis that combines fe  k@xmath14/reflection models and continuum models , including kerrbb , a relativistic disk model similar to the one we use .",
    "that is , the authors jointly applied the continuum - fitting and fe  k@xmath14 methods and fitted simultaneously for a single value of @xmath13 .",
    "the data analyzed in this case were a pair of 0.5  ks _ xmm - newton/_/epic - pn spectra obtained in the `` burst '' timing mode .    while it is not possible for us to account in detail for the gross difference between the near - zero spin reported by @xcite and our near - extreme value , we note the following : first , the round values of @xmath19 , @xmath11 , and @xmath20 that  @xcite  used as input to kerrbb differ significantly from ours , and these differences all serve to drive the spin down ; e.g. , using their values of these parameters and our spectrum sp1 , we find @xmath115 . secondly , and in addition ,  @xcite  fitted for the kerrbb normalization constant , obtaining @xmath116 , whereas the standard procedure , which we follow , is to set @xmath85 to unity when @xmath19 , @xmath11 , and @xmath20 are fixed .",
    "fitting sp1 using @xmath116 ( and the values of @xmath19 , @xmath11 , and @xmath20 adopted by  @xcite ) , we find that the spin drops from @xmath117 to the retrograde value @xmath118 ( and the fit is poor , @xmath119 . )    the near - zero spin result of @xcite is further called into question because no data above 10  kev were used .",
    "this lack of high energy coverage , in the presence of a strong compton component , seriously compromises results obtained using the continuum - fitting method , as we stress at the outset of section  2 ( and as can be deduced by an examination of figure  3 ) .",
    "likewise , results obtained using the fe  k@xmath14/reflection method are compromised by the failure to observe the compton reflection hump around 2030 kev ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "very recently , after posting our paper on the astro - ph archive and while revising it for resubmission , a paper appeared reporting another estimate of the spin of cygnus x-1 via an analysis of the fe  k@xmath14 profile @xcite . assuming that the emissivity profile of the disk can be described by a single power - law with index 3.0 , these authors conclude that  the black hole is close to rotating maximally , \" which is in agreement with our result .",
    "we note that @xcite  do not discuss @xcite or mention the near - zero spin result reported in the latter paper .      based on an analysis of low - frequency ( 0.0125  hz ) quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , @xcite obtained a spin for cygnus x-1 of @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "their result is based on the relativistic precession model of @xcite . in this model",
    ", the qpo is produced as a result of emission from an orbiting bright spot that is undergoing relativistic nodal and periastron precessions in a slightly tilted and eccentric orbit .",
    "the spin parameter is predicted to vary with mass as @xmath122 ( see eqn . 4 in",
    "* ) , and therefore the corrected value of spin is @xmath123 for our adopted black hole mass @xmath124 . the large discrepancy between this moderate value of spin and the extreme value we find may be a consequence of a fundamental assumption of their model , namely , that the black hole is rotating slowly ( @xmath125 ) . on the other hand , the precession model , with its assumption of geodesic motion , may not apply in this instance .      in @xcite ,",
    "results are presented for four dynamical models , models @xmath126 .",
    "we disregard models @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which assume a circular orbit , because these models give poor fits compared to the eccentric orbit models ( @xmath129 ) and because there is clear evidence that the orbit is eccentric . throughout this paper , we have used @xmath23 and @xmath24 deg from model @xmath22 , an asynchronous model with a rotational frequency for the o - star that is 40% greater than the orbital frequency . as an alternative to model @xmath22 , we now consider model @xmath130 , which assumes synchronous rotation .",
    "model @xmath130 gives a poorer fit to the data ( @xmath131 ) , and it results in disharmony between the light - curve and velocity data on the one hand , and the radius and rotational velocity of the o - star on the other ( see table  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "because of this disharmony , the uncertainties in @xmath11 and @xmath20 for model @xmath130 are significantly larger than those for our favored model , although the central values of these parameters differ only modestly : @xmath132 and @xmath133 deg . using these values for model @xmath130 and spectrum sp1 ( which gives the lowest value of spin ) , we repeated our error analysis ( section 6 ) and obtained the following 3@xmath1 lower limit on the spin parameter : @xmath2 .      there remains one uncertainty that calls into question the reliability of the continuum - fitting method , namely , whether the inner x - ray emitting portion of the disk ( which will align with the black hole s spin axis ) is aligned with the binary orbital plane . for a discussion of this question ,",
    "see section  2.2 in @xcite . as an extension of this discussion , we note the following : first",
    ", recent population synthesis studies predict that the majority of systems will have rather small ( @xmath134  deg ) misalignment angles @xcite .",
    "second , in the case of cygnus x-1 , there is reason to believe that the misalignment angle is especially small because of the binary system s low peculiar velocity , which indicates that the system did not experience a large `` kick '' when the black hole formed @xcite . as demonstrated in figure 5 ,",
    "even if there exists a misalignment angle as large as ( e.g. ) 16 degrees , the spin value is still @xmath1350.95 .",
    "one might expect that the accretion disk of a fast - spinning black hole like cygnus  x-1 would be hot ( @xmath1361  kev ) because its inner edge is relatively close to the event horizon and deep in the gravitational potential well .",
    "two principal factors are responsible for the depressed disk temperature ( @xmath137  kev ; table  [ table : model_c_results ] ) .",
    "the first of these is the low rate of mass accretion through the disk , which is manifested by its low luminosity , only @xmath138% of eddington ( table  [ table : model_5_results ] ) .",
    "the second is that relativistic effects ( e.g. , beaming and light bending ) are muted for low disk inclinations : using our fiducial values of @xmath19 , @xmath11 , and @xmath20 , and fixed values of the fit parameters taken from table  2 , we used kerrbb2 to simulate a pair of spectra , one for the inclination of cygnus x-1 , @xmath99  deg , and the other for @xmath139  deg ( which is the inclination of grs  1915 + 105 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the luminosities of the two spectra are the same , @xmath140 , while the disk temperatures are @xmath141  kev and 0.86  kev , respectively .",
    "thus , in this comparison , the temperature of the low - inclination disk is depressed by nearly a factor of two because the relativistic effects are weak .",
    "although careful modeling of warm absorbers ( was ) is usually crucial in determining the spins of supermassive black holes via the fe  k@xmath14 method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that the effects of was are unimportant in estimating the spin of cygnus x-1 via the continuum - fitting method .",
    "we examined all of the available soft - state _ chandra _ hetg spectra of cygnus x-1 ( obsids 2741 , 2742 , 2743 , 12313/sp2 , and 12314/sp3 ) at @xmath142  kev , and we find no evidence for the blend of absorption lines near 0.76  kev ( due , e.g. , to fe  x  fe  xv , o  vii and o  viii ) , which is a telltale signature of a wa .",
    "( the lines was produce above 1 kev are mostly discrete and weaker and therefore have an accordingly much smaller effect on the continuum shape and our spin estimates . )",
    "our preliminary analysis of the low - energy portion ( @xmath143 kev ) of a 50 ks _ hard - state chandra _ hetg spectrum @xcite did reveal the presence of a single wa .",
    "its two most relevant parameters are its column density , @xmath144  @xmath145 , and ionization parameter , @xmath146 .",
    "( its turbulent broadening and redshift are respectively @xmath147  km  s@xmath148 and @xmath149 ; we assume solar abundances . )",
    "this tenuous wa does not affect the continuum shape , but it does produce line blends , the strongest of which is centered at 0.76  kev .",
    "although such a wa is not present in soft - state spectra , we nevertheless tested its effects by reanalyzing sp1 , sp2 and sp3 by introducing the additional model component warmabs , fixing its parameters to the values given above ; we obtained values of spin that are essentially identical to those given in table  2 .",
    "in one further test , we likewise reanalyzed our three spectra including a second thicker and hotter wa that generates a complex of absorption lines between 0.9 and 1.0 kev ( @xmath150  @xmath145 ; @xmath151 ; @xmath152  km  s@xmath148 ; @xmath149 ) .",
    "again , the effects on our spin estimates are negligible .",
    "the spin of cygnus x-1 is extraordinarily high , placing it in the company of the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 , estimated using the continuum - fitting method @xcite , and the supermassive black hole in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , estimated using the fe - line method @xcite .",
    "the spins of both of these black holes are reported to exceed @xmath153 . as @xcite first demonstrated ,",

    "the keplerian velocity of the gas at the isco is approximately half the speed of light , and its orbital frequency is @xmath162  hz . meanwhile , the frequency of rotation of the black hole itself , which is the spin frequency of space - time at its horizon , is @xmath163  hz ( the maximal spin frequency for @xmath9 is 1091 hz ) .    what is the origin of the spin of cygnus x-1",
    "? was the black hole born with its present spin , or was it torqued up gradually by the gas it has accreted over its lifetime ? to achieve a spin of @xmath0 via disk accretion , an initially nonspinning black hole must accrete @xmath164  from its donor @xcite in becoming the @xmath159  that we observe today .",
    "however , to transfer this much mass even at the maximum ( eddington - limited ) accretion rate requires @xmath165 million years ( of converting mass to radiant energy ) we used a constant value , @xmath166 .",
    "however , @xmath167 gradually increases as the black hole spins up , starting at @xmath8 with @xmath168 to @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) for m33  x-7 and @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) for lmc  x-1 . for m33  x-7 and lmc  x-1 ,",

    "( even for @xmath2 obtained for our less probable model , the accretion timescale is @xmath135 25 million years . )",
    "thus , it appears that the spin of cygnus x-1 must be chiefly natal ( also , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although possibly the high spin could be achieved during a short - lived evolutionary phase of hypercritical mass accretion @xcite .",
    "based on our favored dynamical model , we find an extreme value of spin for the black hole primary in cygnus x-1 : @xmath0 at the 3@xmath1 level of confidence . for a less probable ( synchronous ) dynamical model ,",

    "we attribute these differences to our use of response files that have been significantly updated and improved ( section  2 ) .",
    "these new response files not only allowed us to extend the upper energy bound to 45 kev ( compared to the 30 kev bound used by cui et al . ) , but they also greatly improved the fit : @xmath264 versus @xmath265 . furthermore , this comparison is understated because cui et al . included 1% systematic error in the pcu count rates whereas we used 0.5% ; for a systematic error of 1% , our @xmath266 .    applying model  nr1 to sp2 and sp3 also gives very good fits ( table a2 , columns 5 and 6 ) .",
    "however , comparing the results for all three spectra one finds a wide variation in the values of the disk temperature @xmath254 ( 0.270.54  kev ) and inner disk radius @xmath4 ( 1.958.30  @xmath267 ) .",
    "( we focus here on the parameters for the thermal component because this component ultimately delivers our key result , the spin of the black hole . )",
    "we find the performance of this model unsatisfactory for two principal reasons .",
    "first , it returns unlikely and near - zero values of the ionization parameter @xmath268 ( which we have here fixed to zero ) ; this is probably because both the reflection component and line feature are improperly modeled ( see below ) .",
    "secondly , this model implies an unrealistically strong line feature ( ew = 0.40.5  kev ) .",
    "therefore , we now consider an improved model .    * model  nr2 : * for the line feature",
    ", we replace the symmetric gaussian profile with a skewed , relativistic profile via the laor model , while relativistically blurring the three other additive model components using kdblur ( table  a1 ) . the laor model and its companion convolution model kdblur have the serious limitation of assuming a fixed and extreme value of the spin parameter , @xmath269 , and they therefore do not give a proper description of black holes with moderate or low spins .",
    "nevertheless , we consider these models adequate for the present purposes because cygnus x-1 is a rapidly spinning black hole and because the fe  k@xmath14 line is only a cosmetic feature relative to the thermal continuum ( section  4 ) .",
    "the merit of using laor / kdblur here is that the model is simple and the values of the line strength and ionization parameter returned by the fits are reasonable ( table  a3 ) . in the end , however , as in the case of the previous model , we find model nr2 wanting because the parameters it returns for the crucial thermal component ( @xmath254 and @xmath4 ) differ quite significantly for the three spectra .",
    "we now discuss our most physical nonrelativistic model .",
    "* model  nr3 : * in addition to our criticisms of models nr1 and",
    "nr2 , we find these models structurally unsatisfactory because they incorporate two different and discrepant thermal temperatures : diskbb s @xmath270 kev and comptt s @xmath271  kev . in model nr3",
    ", we solve this problem by replacing compbb with simplr , which generates the compton power - law component via a convolution by operating on an arbitrary source of seed photons , which in this case is the thermal component diskbb prior to compton scattering .",
    "meanwhile , we retain the line model laor and the convolution model kdblur . model  nr3 is specified in table  [ table : nr_models ] , and our fit results are given in table  [ table : model_c_results ] .",
    "the fits are good and very comparable to those obtained using the other two models , even though model  nr3 uses one less fit parameter .",
    "we note that achieving these fits requires iron abundances that are @xmath272 times solar .",

    "* four preliminary models , r1r4 : * we now consider a progression of four models that are all built around our relativistic disk model kerrbb2 ( section  3.2 ) .",
    "these models progress toward our adopted model ( section 3.2 ) in the sense that model r1 is the most primitive and our adopted model is the most physically realistic .",
    "all four of these models and our adopted model give very similar results for the parameter of interest , namely @xmath13 , indicating that our key result , the extreme spin of cygnus  x-1 , is quite insensitive to the details of the analysis .",
    "the four preliminary models r1r4 are defined in table  [ table : re_models ] .",
    "every individual component in all four models has already been described either in section  3.2 or in appendix  a. there are only two combinations of model components that are new and that have not been used elsewhere , namely , the reflection components in models r3 and r4 .",
    "their core power - law components are respectively compbb and simplc , each of which is convolved in turn with ireflect and kdblur .",
    "the results for models  r1r4 are presented respectively in tables  [ table : model_1_results]-[table : model_4_results ] . comparing the results for models r1 and r2 , which both employ the widely - used reflection model pexriv ,",
    "model  r2 is preferred because it gives very comparable values of reduced chi - square using two fewer fit parameters , and its reflection component simplr self - consistently generates the power - law with no need for the second thermal component required by compbb .",
    "furthermore , in the case of the nonrelativistic analysis ( appendix  a ) , it was shown that simplr delivers consistent values of @xmath4 and @xmath254 , which compbb fails to do .",
    "tables  [ table : model_3_results ] and  [ table : model_4_results ] summarize our results for models r3 and r4 , which use the convolution reflection model ireflect in place of the additive model pexriv .",
    "while both reflection models are based on the same physics , the virtue of ireflect is that it can take any shape of spectrum as input , whereas pexriv requires a power - law input spectrum . in considering models",
    "r1r4 , we find model  r4 to be superior because it fits the data as well as the other models while using the fewest parameters , and it is the most self - consistent ( see section  3.2 ) .    in a final step ,",
    "as described in section  3.2 , we arrive at our adopted model by replacing the flawed model components laor and kdblur ( see appendix  a ) by kerrdisk and kerrconv .",
    "the virtue of kerrdisk / kerrconv compared to laor / kdblur is that the spin parameter is free , allowing the gr metric to be calculated properly .",
    "we use a single , linked value of @xmath13 in fitting kerrdisk / kerrconv and kerrbb2 .",
