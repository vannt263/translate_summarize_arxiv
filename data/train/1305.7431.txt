    "over the past few years a new view for the formation of globular clusters and their contribution to the milky - way ( mw ) halo has emerged .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic studies have established that globular clusters are not simple stellar populations , but rather are formed from two or more generations of stars with the latter generation(s ) formed from chemically enriched material from the previous generation ( see e.g. , review by gratton et al .",
    "2012 ) . that these systems were able to retain ejecta from massive agb stars , including ejecta of core - collapsed sne for a handful of clusters , to form subsequent generations of stars implies large progenitor masses ( e.g. , joo & lee 2013 , gratton et al . 2012 and references therein , valcarce & catelan 2011 )",
    "through subsequent dynamical evolution it is suggested globular clusters lose large amounts of mass contributing to the mw halo .",
    "martell et al .",
    "( 2011 ) estimate that a minimum fraction of @xmath4 of the halo is from globular clusters while gratton et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggest a fraction @xmath5 ; this is remarkable , since the present - day luminous mass of the mw globular clusters is only about @xmath6 that of the halo . in this new light",
    ", globular clusters appear to be important players in the formation of the mw halo , and thus a better understanding of these systems and their evolution is worthwhile .    here",
    ", we continue our long - term efforts to determine absolute proper motions of globular clusters and derive their orbits in a realistic mw potential .",
    "such data help with the quantifying of their tidal disruption , and with searching for possible dynamical associations between clusters and dwarf spheroidals , in an effort to understand their origin .",
    "we present results for three clusters , ngc 6397 , ngc 6626 ( m 28 ) and ngc 6656",
    "( m 22 ) , which have previous absolute proper - motion determinations .",
    "our new results indicate disagreement between ground - based and hst - based measurements for ngc 6397 , imply a new type of orbit for ngc 6626 than previoulsy derived , and provide a higher accuracy measure for ngc 6656 .",
    "ground - based measurements for these clusters were presented in the work by cudworth & hanson ( 1993 , hereafter ch93 , and references therein ) .",
    "hst - based measurements were done for ngc 6397 ( kalirai et al .",
    "2007 , milone et al . 2006 ) and for ngc 6626 ( chen et al . 2004 ) .",
    "since all three clusters are at low galactic latitude , the question of the inertial reference system poses some problems .",
    "our work , which is calibrated on the icrs via @xmath0 stars , provides an important comparison .",
    "ngc 6656 ( m 22 ) is an extended blue horizontal branch ( ehb ) cluster ( e.g. , lee et al .",
    "2007 ) with a known iron abundance spread ( da costa et al .",
    "2009 , marino et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ) presenting the possibility that it might be the nuclear cluster of a formerly massive system ( like m 54 in the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , e.g. , monaco et al . 2005 ) .",
    "ngc 6626 is also a moderate ehb cluster as classified by lee et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , while ngc 6397 is a less massive , more traditional globular cluster .",
    "we adopt various parameters for these clusters from the database of harris ( 1996 , 2010 updated and to be referred to as h96 ) .    in the following section we describe our measurements , while the proper - motion determinations are outlined in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we compare our results with existing measurements , and in sections 5 and 6 we give the velocities and the orbits determined in an axisymmetric and bar model , respectively . in section 7",
    "we present a discussion of our results .",
    "our program to measure absolute proper motions of globular clusters is a distinct part of the southern proper motion program ( spm ) which was described in a series of papers : platais et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , girard et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2004 , 2011 ) .",
    "the cluster program of the spm has provided measurements for 34 clusters reported in a series of papers : dinescu et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999ab , 2003 ) and casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2010 ) , named papers i through vi , respectively . including the sample presented here ,",
    "there are 37 clusters measured by the spm , or @xmath7 of the total number of clusters with such measurements .    for convenience",
    ", we describe here in brief the major aspects of the program and measurements extracted from a more complete description given in paper vi .",
    "the first epoch of the survey is entirely photographic , and was taken from 1965 to 1979 .",
    "the second epoch is approximately one third photographic ( taken from 1988 to 1998 ) and two thirds ccd - based ( taken from 2003 through 2008 ) .",
    "for the clusters , we also take frames centered on each cluster in addition to the `` brick '' coverage of the main survey .",
    "we list the spm field centers , the photographic and ccd material used in the reductions , and the epochs of the observations in table 1 .",
    "all three fields lacked complete ccd coverage from our main spm survey ; these gaps are at the edges of the fields , and amount to between 5 and 17@xmath8 of the total spm field area , as listed in table 1 . for these areas ,",
    "second - epoch positions are taken from @xmath0 , tycho-2 ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) , ucac2 ( zacharias et al . 2000 ) and 2mass point source catalog ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) . given the construction of the input list of objects to be measured , these positions are predominantly from 2mass .",
    "the clusters presented here are at low galactic latitude and toward the bulge direction .",
    "since extinction is high in these directions , we lack extragalactic objects to tie to an inertial reference frame ; therefore , we use @xmath0 stars to correct to absolute proper motions .",
    "thus , the proper motions are on the international celestial reference system via @xmath0 . only in the case of ngc 6397",
    "have we found a handful of galaxies to check our @xmath0-based zero point .",

    "the plate scale is 55.1/mm , and each field covers @xmath14 .",
    "the plates contain two exposures : one of 2 hours that reaches @xmath15 and an offset of 2 minutes . during both exposures , an objective grating",
    "is used which produces a series of diffraction images on either side of the central , zero - order images .",
    "the multiple sets of images for bright stars ( for @xmath16 , there are only long exposure , zero - order images ) allow us to detect and model magnitude - dependent systematics that affect positions and consequently proper motions . the method has been described and thoroughly tested by girard et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and it shows that @xmath0 stars with @xmath17 and faint cluster stars ( @xmath16 ) can be placed on a system that is largely free of systematics .",
    "the plates are measured with the yale pds microdensitometer in an object - by - object mode with a pixel size of 12.7 @xmath18 m . for each spm field",
    ", we measure a preselected set of stars ( see also papers iv , v and vi ) .",
    "this set consists of all @xmath0 stars ( typically 100 per field ) , a set of @xmath19 tycho-2 stars ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) , another set of @xmath20 bright ( @xmath21 ) ucac2 stars , reference stars and cluster - region stars .",
    "reference and cluster stars are selected from ucac2 and 2mass catalogs .",
    "cluster - region stars are selected to reside within a @xmath22 radius from the cluster center .",
    "reference stars consist of two subsets : one set uniformly distributed over the entire field , the other as a ring around each cluster with radius @xmath23 . within the ring and cluster area ,",
    "all objects found in ucac2 or 2mass are selected for the input list .",
    "for the uniformly distributed reference stars over the entire field , we select a fraction of ucac2 and 2mass stars imposed by the time limitation of the pds scans .",
    "the bright stars in the input catalog assure an appropriate magnitude range of various diffraction orders with which to model magnitude - dependent systematics .",
    "only @xmath0 stars are used to determine the correction to absolute proper motions .",
    "the reference stars ( ring and entire field ) are used to map plate positions into one another as well as ccd positions into the photographic positions . during these long pds scans ( up to 24 hours )",
    "we monitor a set of 8 to 10 stars that are used to correct for thermal drift .",
    "positions , instrumental magnitudes and other image parameters are derived with the yale centering routines that fit a two - dimensional elliptical gaussian function to the image profile ( lee & van altena 1983 ) .",
    "the ccd system mounted on the double astrograph consists of two main cameras : a 4k x 4k pixelvision ( pv ) camera ( 15 micron pixel ) in the focal plane of the yellow lens and an apogee alta 2k x 2k ( 12 micron pixel ) camera in the focal plane of the blue lens .",
    "the pv s field of view is @xmath24 with a scale of 0.83/pix .",
    "the apogee alta camera covers a @xmath25 area with a scale of 0.74/pix .",
    "the pv data were used for both astrometry and @xmath26 photometry , while the apogee data were used only for @xmath27 photometry .",
    "the observations are taken with the diffraction grating oriented at @xmath28 .",
    "this ensures a dynamical range of 10 mag ( i.e. , 6 from the ccd plus 4 from the grating ) .",
    "exposure times are 120 sec , reaching the same depth as the first - epoch plates . for each cluster nine frames",
    "are taken , in addition to the survey ccd frames taken for each spm field ( tab .",
    "1 ) . these on - cluster frames have exposures of 30 , 60 and 120 sec .",
    "the astrometric reduction of the ccd data is thoroughly described in papers v and vi , and in girard et al .",
    "thus , here we only summarize the procedure applied .",
    "the ccd data are corrected for bias , dark ( when needed ) and flat fielding .",
    "the sextractor code ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) is used for object detections , aperture photometry and preliminary x , y centers .",
    "final x , y centers are derived by fitting two - dimensional elliptical gaussian functions to image intensities .",
    "the obtained positional precision is @xmath29 mas per single measurement , for @xmath30 . for each ccd frame , we apply two corrections before merging them into a `` pseudo '' plate .",
    "the first correction is the optical field angle distortion ( ofad ) which has been determined from stacked residuals into ucac2 , and is applied as a correction map to the ccd data ( see paper v and girard et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the second correction refers to the positions of different grating - order images that must be placed on a common system with those of the central - order images .",
    "we found offsets between the average position of symmetric image orders and the position of the central order .",
    "these offsets are not related to the magnitude of the object , as is the case for photographic plates .",
    "therefore these offsets were corrected as such , a simple offset between different image order systems ( see also paper v , girard et al .",
    "next , all of the ccd frames for a given spm field from the main survey are linked to produce a @xmath31 ccd pseudo - plate .",
    "the procedure to link the ccd frames was developed for the construction of the spm4 catalog and is described by girard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . in brief , the ccd x , y positions of each frame are transformed onto the system of the ucac2 to facilitate pasting together the 100 - 200 frames that comprise a @xmath31 spm field .",
    "an iterative overlap method is employed to perform this task using tycho2 stars as an external reference system to ensure that systematics from the individual frame overlaps do not accumulate .",
    "the ccd frames that contribute to any one field s pseudo - plate may actually span two to three years range in epoch whereas an actual plate has a single epoch .",
    "for this reason , once preliminary proper motions are determined from a second - epoch pseudo - plate , an improved pseudo - plate is constructed , one that incorporates the preliminary proper motions prior to pasting the frames together in a new overlap solution .",
    "the ccd @xmath32 photometry is derived from aperture photometry calibrated into tycho2 ( corrected to the johnson system ) , and other external catalogs such as the guide star photometric catalog ii ( bucciarelli et al . 2001 ) .",
    "photographic photometry from the first - epoch plates calibrated on tycho2 is adopted when no astrograph ccd photometry is available , ( see girard et al .",
    "proper motions are determined using the central - plate overlap method ( e.g. , girard et al .",
    "we transform all measurements  ccd pseudo - plate , on - cluster ccd frames and photographic positions of various grating - order systems  into one master photographic position system , that of a visual plate s central diffraction - order images . this transformation is modeled as a polynomial function of x",
    ", y coordinates of up to 5th order .",
    "stars with magnitudes between @xmath33 and 18 distributed uniformly over the field and with a higher density in a ring around each cluster are used as reference stars to model the transformation .",
    "the number of reference stars ranges between @xmath34 and 7000 stars . in the first round of plate transformations ,",
    "stars are assigned zero proper motions .",
    "the process is repeated , iteratively , with proper motions updated at each iteration .",
    "a linear least - squares fit of positions as a function of time gives the proper motion of each object .",
    "positional measurements that differ by more than @xmath35 from the best fit line are rejected as outliers .",
    "the proper - motion error is given by the scatter around the best - fit line . throughout this paper ,",
    "proper - motion units are mas yr@xmath3 . also , @xmath36cos@xmath37 .",
    "the correction to absolute proper motion is determined from the difference between the @xmath0 proper motions and the relative proper motions obtained in the previous section .",
    "these differences are also used to check for various trends as a function of magnitude and position on the plate . during the analysis",
    ", we found that the b plates in spm field 582 have very strong magnitude equation which our correction scheme could not correct at a reliable level .",
    "therefore , for this field , we used only the y plates ( see tab .",
    "the proper - motion differences @xmath38 as a function of @xmath26 magnitude are shown in figure 1 for each spm field .",
    "average formal proper - motion errors of individual @xmath0 stars are shown in the bottom right of each panel , and they range between 2.1 and 2.4 mas yr@xmath3 .",
    "fields 582 and 583 however , show a larger scatter than the formal proper - motion errors .",
    "this is largely due to crowding in these low galactic latitude , toward the bulge fields .",
    "also , in these fields there are proper - motion gradients across the field as shown in figure 2 . here",
    ", we present the vector point diagrams ( vpds ) in the left panels , and the proper motions in both coordinates as a function of x and y coordinates ( in mm at 55.1 ",
    "/mm ) in the middle and right panels .",
    "fields 582 and 583 show gradients across the field which are likely due to true proper - motion variation .",
    "both fields have large reddening ( @xmath39 at the cluster centers ) , which also indicates significant differential reddening across the field .",
    "thus , the mean motion of the reference system may change across the field , in part due to sampling different mean brightness stars , in part due to true kinematical variation as one moves towards the bulge .",
    "the correction to absolute proper motion , or the zero point , is determined from the average of the proper - motion differences as follows .",
    "first , we eliminate stars brighter than @xmath40 , and with proper - motion differences larger than 30 mas yr@xmath3 . to determine the average and its error , we use probability plots ( hamaker 1978 ) trimmed at @xmath41 at each side , to eliminate outliers .",
    "these values are listed in table 2 , columns three and four , together with the number of @xmath0 stars used in the determination .",
    "they are also represented with a cross in fig .",
    "2 - left panels , and a horizontal line in the middle and right panels .",
    "they are taken to represent the correction to absolute at the center of the spm field . in fig .",
    "2 , we also show the location of each cluster with a vertical bar . thus ,",
    "ngc 6397 and ngc 6626 have no field correction applied , since for ngc 6397 no gradients are apparent , and ngc 6266 is located close to the field center . for ngc 6656 we have applied a correction for field dependence in @xmath42 .",

    "for the first two estimates , we select red giants ( rgs ) and blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars in the cluster from 2mass photometry",
    ". then we use proper - motion membership probabilities from the study by ch93 and references therein to earlier work of the same group .",
    "ch93 used photographic plates of more appropriate plate scale for proper - motion membership probabilities , but that go only to a limiting @xmath43 , and cover a small field of view . throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to these probabilities as @xmath44 .",
    "lastly , we separate the cluster from the field using the proper - motion distribution obtained in this study for all stars measured within @xmath45 of the cluster center . for the samples defined by ch93 membership probabilities , or by 2mass photometry we use probability plots trimmed at @xmath41 to estimate the average proper motion and its error . in figure 3",

    "the subsequent panels show the vdps of all these samples .",
    "the rg sample is the most contaminated by field stars as there is some overlap with foreground / background stars in this region of the cmd .",
    "thus , to estimate the average motion for this sample , we first select stars within 8 mas  yr@xmath3 from an initial estimate of the mean cluster motion given by the peak of the proper - motion distribution . to this trimmed sample",
    "we then apply the probability plot estimate .",

    "we also show the vpd of all stars within @xmath45 of the cluster center , and with @xmath47 .",
    "the cluster is very well separated from the field , and thus we can use a traditional method to fit the proper - motion distribution in each coordinate with the sum of two gaussians , one representing the field , the other the cluster ( see e.g. , girard et al .",
    "the observed proper - motion distribution is constructed from the data smoothed by individual proper - motion errors .",
    "the mean and the width of the fitted gaussian to the cluster sample represent the mean proper motion of the cluster , and its error ( when divided by the square root of the number of cluster stars in the fit ) .",

    "all our four estimates ( table 3 ) agree to within their formal errors , thus indicating that neither cluster membership , nor color or magnitude - related systematics are significantly affecting our result . in what follows",
    ", we will adopt as the relative cluster proper motion the value determined from the gaussian fit of the proper - motion distribution .",

    "2010 ) determine the proper motion of sagittarius dwarf spheroidal ( sgr ) core with respect to foreground stars ( in the bulge and thick disk ) using hst data .",
    "due to the lack of background galaxies , they have to adopt a kinematical model for foreground stars in order to correct sgr s proper motion to an absolute value , and this correction is of the order of 6 mas  yr@xmath3 in @xmath116 .",
    "other studies use background bluge stars in the field of more nearby globular clusters , assuming bulge stars are at rest ; however , this assumption is applicable for clusters very near to @xmath117 ( e.g. , terndrup et al . 1998 , for ngc 6522 at @xmath118 ) .",

    "at the prompting of a referee for this paper , we give below a brief discussion stressing the distinction between precision and accuracy as it relates to proper - motion measurement , the practical limitations of `` root n '' , and the desire for continued comparison of ground - based and hst - based measures .    a crucial aspect in determining the accurate _",
    "absolute _ proper motion of a stellar system is establishing the inertial reference frame , preferably given by extragalactic objects .",
    "the number of such objects and the precision with which their images can be centered is often the limiting factor in such measurements .",
    "for this reason , photographic studies employing plates with excellent scale but relatively narrow field of view provide precise _ relative _ proper motions and , thus , superb cluster membership estimates . however , typically this material is not deep or wide enough to measure sufficient extragalactic background objects to yield a useful absolute proper - motion reference frame .",
    "spm s advantage is that it is deep and wide enough to secure sufficient calibrators ( whether they be @xmath0 stars or galaxies ) for reliable absolute proper - motion determination , even if the individual proper motions are not as precise as those of studies with better plate scale .",
    "another advantage of spm is that magnitude - dependent systematics can be calibrated and removed due to the multiple images per object ( exposures are taken with a diffraction grating ) thereby also allowing the bright reference frame of @xmath0 to be tied to that of the cluster stars .",
    "hst imaging provides extremely precise astrometry over a very small field of view , thus giving severe importance to background galaxies and the possible systematics involved in linking them to the target stellar system .",
    "hst - based astrometry of stars versus galaxies was pioneered by j. anderson and i. king , and further developed by j. anderson ( e.g. , anderson & king 2000 , anderson & bedin 2010 ) .",
    "this remains a non - trivial issue given the time dependence of the small but significant nonlinearity of the hst detectors . while hst - based errors are formally very low , it is worth making comparisons to well - established ground - based measures in order to validate the expected accuracy .",
    "for instance , for both the globular cluster m4 and the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( sgr ) , our previously published @xmath0-based results agree within @xmath120 of the subsequent hst measurements , ( m4 : dinescu et al .",

    "thus , our discrepant result for ngc 6397 came as a bit of a surprise .",
    "it is worth noting that in some cases hst - based absolute proper motions have changed significantly from an earlier to a later study of the same object .",

    "2012 ) , in the sense that the fainter subgiant branch has stars with higher metallicity .",
    "the currently proposed scenario for clusters with clear iron abundance spread is that their progenitors were the most massive of all the progenitors of globular clusters such that they were able to retain ejecta from core - collapsed sne , and form a next generation of stars from this enriched environment .",
    "the emerging picture from both photometry and spectroscopy is that most globular clusters host two ( or more ) distinct stellar populations ( e.g. , gratton et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) : the first has abundance patterns similar to halo stars and is in proportion of @xmath158 , while the second displays the na , n , al , he - enhanced and c , o , ne , mg - depleted pattern , and is in proportion of @xmath159 .",
    "the former is interpreted as the first generation of stars , while the latter as the second generation formed from a combination of enriched material by the first generation and some pristine material .",
    "the details of the enrichment of the second generation ( and of following ones ) appear to be regulated by the ability of the progenitor to retain ejecta , and this has to do primarily with the initial mass of the progenitor ( e.g. , valcarce & catelan 2011 , gratton et al .",

    "therefore , from the available orbital information and from the current galactic location of these six clusters , it appears that they are dynamically unrelated , and each formed in its own parent system .",
    "therefore , we are seeing at least six ( if no more iron - spread clusters are found ) massive progenitors that hosted the formation of these chemically complex clusters before they were completely destroyed by internal and external ( orbital ) dynamical forces ; five if ngc 1851 is excluded .",

    "if these systems were indeed as massive as predicted by e.g. , valcarce & catelan ( 2011 ) , they may have also hosted the formation of a few other less - massive clusters , with the central , nuclear one , being the most chemically - enriched .",
    "we would like to thank rick rees and kyle cudworth for providing us their data for the clusters and for many extensive and valuable discussions .",
    "we acknowledge support by the nsf through grant ast04 - 0908996 .",
