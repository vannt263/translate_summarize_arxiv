    "laser fields have been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for the exploration and modification of the materials properties .",
    "for example , in conventional semiconducting nanostructures a variety of applications have been established such as the various forms of the photo electronic devices ( e.g. , the radiation - controlled field - effect transistors , photodiodes , and the light - emitting diodes @xcite ) . on the other hand , graphene with its many unusual physical properties ( to mention but a few , the half integer quantum hall effect @xcite",
    ", the klein tunneling @xcite and the conductance properties @xcite ) offers a new platform to explore radiation effects .",
    "the influence of electromagnetic fields on graphene has been recently a subject of intense research .",
    "particularly interesting examples are the linear response to and the frequency dependence of the conductivity @xcite , the photon - assisted transport @xcite , the microwave and far - infrared response @xcite , the plasmon spectrum @xcite , as well as the nonlinear response to the electromagnetic radiation @xcite .",
    "the potential applications of graphene in terahertz electronics were pointed out in refs.@xcite .",
    "the resonant interaction between graphene and an electromagnetic field may open a dynamical gap in the quasiparticle spectrum of graphene @xcite , which leads to a strong suppression of the quasiparticle transmission through a graphene p - n junction .",
    "however , a directed current without applying any dc bias voltage can be generated in certain conditions as a result of inelastic quasiparticle tunneling assisted by one- or two - photon absorptions @xcite . another way to generate",
    "a direct current is to use shaped , timely tuned electromagnetic pulses @xcite which also may generate a valley current .",
    "therefore , it seems possible to control the transport properties of diverse graphene tunneling structures by the variation of the strength and the frequency of the external radiation fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the potential of graphene for spin - dependent transport ( spintronic ) applications is well documented by now @xcite .",
    "motivated by these facts , in this work , we study theoretically the spin polarized transport through a graphene - spin - valve device in the presence of a monochromatic laser field .",
    "the method is based on the standard keldysh nonequilibrium green s function approach , as described in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find that additional peaks emerge in the bias dependence of the differential conductance that reflect the resonant tunneling through the photon - induced sidebands . the strong suppression of the multiple photon processes stemming from the combined effect of the radiation field and the tunneling through the graphene leads to a strong decay of the differential conductance at a high bias voltage . the resonant interaction of the quasiparticle in graphene with the radiation field results in a dynamical gap in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "when the bias voltage lies inside this gap , the differential conductance displays a zero value region situated symmetrically around the zero bias .",
    "the width of this region can be tuned by changing the radiation strength and the frequency , which also cause a shift of the resonant peaks in the differential conductance .",
    "the tmr versus the bias voltage exhibits an oscillatory behavior , and its oscillatory amplitude can be controlled by the radiation field strength and/or the frequency .",
    "we consider a spin valve device consisting of an extended graphene sheet ( that defines the @xmath0 plane ) contacted by two ferromagnetic electrodes . a gate voltage @xmath1 applied on graphene shifts the dirac point away from the zero energy .",
    "the two electrodes are voltage - biased with respect to each other with a bias @xmath2 .",
    "the electrical current flows in the @xmath3 direction . additionally , we assume that a laser field is homogenously irradiating the structure . within the metallic electrodes we assume the field to be shielded and ignore thus its effect on the electrodes .",
    "the laser field is monochromatic and is linearly polarized along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "the low energy graphene hamiltonian around the dirac points has the minimal coupling form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the operator of the electron momentum in the graphene plane , @xmath7 is the electron charge , @xmath8 is the vector build out of the pauli matrices in the sublattice space , and @xmath9 is the laser s vector potential . in the tight binding description @xcite , @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the nearest neighbor hopping energy , and @xmath12 being the carbon - carbon distance . the vector potential @xmath13 is taken as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the frequency of the radiation field , and @xmath16 is its amplitude . diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ hg1 ] ) in the absence of the radiation field , one finds the eigenvalues @xmath17 with @xmath18 denoting the band index , and the eigenstates @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the volume of the system , and @xmath21 we introduce the field operators @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the usual annihilation operator for an electron in the band @xmath24 , with the momentum @xmath6 and the spin @xmath25 , and then express the hamiltonian ( [ hg1 ] ) in the second quantized form as @xmath26 where @xmath27 applying the rotating wave approximation @xcite , we neglect the energy nonconserving terms .",
    "accounting for the coupling between the graphene and the two ferromagnetic electrodes we write for the hamiltonian of the complete tunnel junction in the presence of the laser @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 @xmath32 eqs .",

    "( [ fjf ] ) , we further set the symmetrical voltage division : @xmath71 , and put @xmath72 in the numerical calculations .",
    "the expression ( [ fjf ] ) is the central result of this paper , and allows one to describe the spin - polarized transport in a nonlinear response regime , i.e. , high bias voltage or high strength of the radiation fields .",
    "please , note the difference to our previous study @xcite in which we studied the influence of a time - dependent chemical potential ( realized as an oscillating bias voltage ) . in the present study the radiation field , coupled to the carrier as a vector potential , induces a dynamical gap in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "thus , in turn leads to a marked changed in the transport properties and tmr , as shown below .",
    "the tmr is deduced according to the conventional definition @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the time - averaged current flowing through the system in the parallel ( antiparallel ) configuration .",
    "based on the above analytical expressions , we present the numerical calculations for the spin polarized transport through the system .",
    "firstly , we assume the linewidth function @xmath75 to be independent of the energy within the wide band approximation , and the two electrodes are made of the same material . introducing the degree of the spin polarizations of the left and the right electrodes @xmath76 , we can write @xmath77 where @xmath78 describes the coupling between the graphene and the electrodes in the absence of an internal magnetization .",
    "we set the temperature to zero and @xmath79 ev in our calculation .",
    "in addition , we choose the frequency @xmath80 , and the voltage @xmath81 so that the dirac approximation remains valid for such energies @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig1](a ) shows the bias dependence of the differential conductance @xmath82 for different radiation strengths in the parallel configuration of the two electrodes . in the absence of the radiation field ,",
    "the differential conductance exhibits a strong dip structure ( see the fig.[fig1](a ) ) .",
    "the graphene spin valve device is sensitive to the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "when the radiation field is applied , some characteristic features are presented explicitly in the transport .",
    "firstly , close to the zero bias voltage , a salient zero value region appears symmetrically in the differential conductance , and the width of the region becomes large with increasing the radiation strength .",
    "this is because the resonant interaction between the graphene and the external radiation field opens a dynamical gap in the spectrum of the quasiparticle in the graphene .",
    "when the bias voltage lies inside this gap , the graphene can be viewed as an insulator , thus the electron tunneling through the graphene is suppressed . additionally , the combined effects of the radiation field and the graphene tunneling properties results in multi photon processes ( see eq .",
    "( [ gremx1 ] ) ) , which are manifested a successive peaks in the differential conductance as a function of the bias voltage .",
    "the peaks close to and far away from the zero bias point are suppressed .",
    "this is due to the nature of the insulator - like properties in the dynamical gap ( for peaks close to @xmath83 ) , and ( for those far away from @xmath83 ) due to the lower amplitude of multi photon processes with an increasing number of exchanged photons at a fixed field strength . in general , with the increase of the radiation field strength , the resonant peaks are weakened ( see fig.[fig1](b ) ) .",
    "this behavior is different from the case of when an oscillating gate voltage is applied , in which case the resonant peaks increase uniformly with increasing the ac gate voltage amplitude @xcite .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the sidebands for an oscillating gate voltage are produced due to the modulation of each of the quasiparticle levels by the gate voltage , while those for the present case are caused by the electron scattering between the bands . when the electrons are injected from the electrode to the graphene , the radiation field results in multiple electron scattering events .",
    "each scattering process provides a sideband .",
    "when the bias windows cross this sideband , the resonant tunneling occurs leading to the appearance of the resonant peak . when the radiation strength is enhanced , the dynamical gap increases .",
    "thus the sidebands fall into the gap at some stage , and the scattering probability of the electrons is suppressed due to the linear density of state ( dos ) in graphene which explains the decrease of the peaks .",
    "another pronounced feature is that the positions of the peaks shift in the direction away from the origin with increasing the radiation strength , which also differs from the case of a gate voltage@xcite , where the positions of the peaks are fixed .",
    "this is due to the increase of the dynamical gap lifting the photon - assisted sidebands .",
    "[ fig1](c ) shows the bias dependence of the differential conductance for different frequencies @xmath15 in the parallel configuration of the electrodes . with increasing the frequency , the dynamical gap diminishes leading to a decrease of the width of the zero value region and to a shift of the peaks towards the origin",
    "especially , one can find that the amplitude of the peaks become larger when the frequency grows .",
    "the reason is that the frequency increase lifts the photon - induced sidebands , which causes the increase of the dos for the sidebands , thus enhancing the electrons tunneling through the graphene sheet .",
    "fig.[fig2](a ) shows the bias dependence of the differential conductance for the different polarizations @xmath84 in the parallel electrodes configuration . in the differential conductance",
    "the peaks are viewed as stemming from the resonant contributions of the sidebands . and",
    "the other part may be attributed to the off - resonant tunneling .",
    "it is observed that the latter contribution is almost independent of @xmath84 ; while the former exhibits a sizable dependence on the polarization .",
    "this can be understood roughly in that the sidebands become more spin - selective with increasing the polarization , thus gradually turning off the spin - flip channel ( mixing channel ) on the sidebands .",
    "this decreases the differential conductance for the resonant states .",
    "for very weak peaks , the contribution from the background off - resonant tunneling may compete with those from the resonant states , making the total change vague .",
    "fig.[fig2](b ) shows the bias dependence of the differential conductance for different gate voltages .",
    "it is found that the oscillation peaks and the zero value region shift towards the positive direction of the bias voltage since the positions of the dirac points vary due to the gate voltage .",
    "the additional interesting phenomenon is that the amplitude of the oscillation peaks increases with increasing the gate voltage .",
    "this is because the gate voltage lifts the quasiparticle level of the central graphene in the bias windows , the linear dos of graphene enhances the tunneling probability from the ferromagnetic electrode to graphene .",
    "the differential conductance as a function of the radiation strength for different radiation frequencies in the parallel configuration of the electrodes magnetizations is shown in fig . [",
    "fig3](a ) . the differential conductance with varying the radiation field strength exhibits several resonant peaks .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that , with a fixed bias window and a fixed frequency , the dynamical gap in the quasiparticle spectrum of graphene becomes larger for stronger radiation field strength , which pushes the sidebands upwards . when the sidebands cross the bias windows , the resonant transport occurs , which is then manifested in the conductance peaks .",
    "when the radiation field strength is large enough , the differential conductance tends to a constant value which almost does not vary with the frequency , hinting on the conclusion that graphene can be identified as a pure resistance in this situation .",
    "[ fig3](b ) shows the dependence of the differential conductance on the radiation frequency @xmath15 for the different radiation strength in the parallel configuration of the electrodes .",
    "it is clearly seen that when @xmath15 approaches zero ( note the magnitude of the field , i.e. @xmath85 , is finite ) , the differential conductance diminishes owing to the large dynamical gap . with increasing the frequency , the dynamical gap shrinks , which causes lowering in energy of the photon - induced sidebands .",
    "therefore , this inverse process ( to fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) causes the resonant peaks as well in the spectrum in the bias windows .",
    "it is found further that the interval between the peaks is not uniform since the radiation frequency changes the dynamical gap in a nonlinear way .",
    "moreover , increasing the radiation field strength enlarges the dynamical gap , and moves the resonant peaks in the differential conductance away from the origin .",
    "the bias dependence of the tmr for the different radiation strengths and frequencies is shown in fig .",
    "the tmr as a function of the bias voltage exhibits an oscillatory behavior .",
    "we assign this behavior to the combined effects of the radiation field , the graphene and spin valve properties . in order to clarify this point more clearly",
    ", we plot the bias dependence of tmr for the different polarization in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "one can observe that the tmr changes in a non - linear manner : the tmr values in the off - resonant regions become larger than those at resonant points .",
    "this is because graphene remains the insulator - like in the off - resonant tunneling , the ballistic spin tunneling enhances the tmr .",
    "in addition , at the high bias voltage , the oscillation peaks decay sharply due to the suppression of the multi photon processes in graphene . with increasing the radiation strength ( or frequency ) ,",
    "the oscillation is enhanced ( or weakened ) due to the interplay between the spin valve effect and the dynamical gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , we studied theoretically the spin polarized transport through a graphene spin valve device assisted by a linearly polarized , monochromatic laser field and in the presence of a dc bias and a gate voltage .",
    "the method is based on the standard keldysh nonequilibrium green s function approach .",
    "we find that the bias dependence of the differential conductance exhibits additional peaks due to the resonant transport through the photon - assisted sidebands .",
    "the resonant interaction of the quasiparticle in the graphene sheet with the radiation field causes a dynamical gap in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "when the bias voltage lies inside this gap region , the differential conductance displays a zero value region situated symmetrically around the zero bias .",
    "the value of the dynamical gap depends on the strength and the frequency of the external radiation field , thus the width of this zero value region in the differential conductance can be tuned by changing the radiation strength and the frequency , which also causes the shift of the resonant peaks in the differential conductance .",
    "we explored the behavior of the peaks in the differential conductance with varying the radiation field strength and its frequency and exposed the dependence on the spin polarization of the ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "we also demonstrated that the combined effects of the radiation field , the graphene and the spin valve properties result in an oscillatory behavior in the tmr .",
    "this oscillatory amplitude can be varied by changing the parameters of the radiation field .",
