    "radial velocity ( rv ) surveys have provided a wealth of exoplanet discoveries around sun - like stars in recent years ( california planet survey , @xcite , lick - carnegie exoplanet survey , @xcite ; coralie survey , @xcite ; and the harps survey , @xcite to name a few ) , but they have not found a correspondingly large number of brown dwarf ( bd ) companions @xcite .",
    "bd companions lie on the mass spectrum between planets and stars and are defined as being between 13@xmath1 and 75.5 @xmath1 ( based on the deuterium and hydrogen fusion limits ) @xcite .",
    "the lack of bds within 3 au of their host star was first recognized in @xcite , and is known as the bd `` desert '' .",
    "this result is unlikely to be due to observational bias because the rv semiamplitudes of bd are many hundreds to a few thousand meters per second , which is easily detectable by these surveys @xcite .",
    "thus the lack of bd at close to moderate distances from their respective host stars points to an explanation based in bd formation mechanisms .",
    "although the formation of low - mass companions ( planets through low mass stars ) to sun - like stars is still an area of active research , in overview there are two main mechanisms : planets form from a protoplanetary disks and stellar companions [ in a similar range of separations ] from molecular cloud fragmentation . given the mass range of bd companions they could form through either mechanism ( or both ) .",
    "understanding the origin of the bd desert can put major constraints on the upper mass limit for companion formation in protoplanetary disks , and a lower mass limit on formation via fragmentation .",
    "recent efforts to quantify the frequency of companions as a function of mass in the bd desert have found that the overall frequency of bd companions at close to moderate distances from their host star ( @xmath13 10 au ) is less than @xmath14 @xcite , and more recently @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this value is low compared to @xmath16 for planetary companions @xcite and @xmath17 for stellar companions in a similar range of separations @xcite .",
    "@xcite went a step further and defined the driest part of the desert to be where there was a minimum in the number of companions per unit interval in log mass ; they found this position to be at a companion mass of @xmath18 .",

    "although formally statistically significant , both the transit and anti - transit signals are likely caused by residual systematics in the cleaned photometric data set , and thus we conclude there is no evidence for a transit signal in the photometric data .",
    "this procedure can be used to determine the confidence with which we can rule out transits of a companion with a given radius .",
    "specifically , the confidence with which we can exclude a companion with a given @xmath196 is simply the fraction of the steps in the markov chain where the companion transits , which produces a transit with a @xmath210 relative to the constant fit that is greater than some value of @xmath210 .",

    "the resulting cumulative probability distributions are shown in figure [ fig : exctrans ] . given the values of @xmath210 found for anti - transits , we conservatively consider thresholds of @xmath212 to be robust . for this value , we can exclude companions with @xmath213 with 50% confidence ( i.e. , for 50% of the trials ) , and companions with @xmath214 with 90% confidence .",

    "based on the derived spectroscopic parameters for the host star and the results discussed in section [ truemass ] , it is highly likely that is a bd companion to assuming a logarithmic or linear prior on the distribution of mass ratios .",
    "working with the minimum mass for of 31.7 @xmath0 2.0 @xmath1 , we can compare it to current distribution of masses in the literature .",
    "@xcite investigated the mass function of both stellar and planetary companions and found that they both decreased by a substantial fraction as they approached the minimum of the bd desert . in the case of the stellar mass function ,",
    "it dropped by two orders of magnitude from the 1 @xmath2 to the middle of the bd desert . on the planetary mass side ,",

    "@xcite define their mass functions as number of companions per unit interval in log mass , and find the minimum of the distributions to be at @xmath18 .",
    "in order to better understand this minimum , it is necessary to increase the number of objects ( or place tighter constraints by non - detections ) in this region of the mass function , and takes us one step closer to that goal",
    ".    stands out in respect to other brown dwarfs in two significant ways .",
    "first , it has a relatively low eccentricity , 0.1442 , given its moderately long period of @xmath37 47 days . to place this point in perspective ,",
    "is plotted against a catalog of bds from @xcite in figure [ perecc ] .",
    "two aspects of this plot are particularly interesting : first , is in an underdense region in period space . in the inset of figure [ perecc ]",
    "there is a clear rise in the envelope of eccentricity as one moves to larger periods until one reaches roughly 200 days .",
    "is either on or below the bottom edge of this envelope .",
    "there is the possibility that this effect is due to observational bias ; for low signal to noise ratios ( snr ) , one often measures a non - zero eccentricity even when the true eccentricity is zero . for a given radial velocity precision and companion mass , longer periods will have lower snr ( since the semi - amplitude is smaller ) , and so the lack of low eccentricity companions at long periods could be due to this effect . in any case , there are so few bd in this plot , that it is not clear whether low eccentricity is significant , so further comment on this will have to wait until more data is available .",
    "this bd companion is also an outlier in metallicity space . in figure [ metalecc ]",
    "is again plotted with the bd from @xcite .",
    "s metallicity is significantly super solar , and exists in an empty region of eccentricity - metallicity space . as in the previous figure ,",
    "the plot is merely suggestive of interesting astrophysics , but there are not a sufficient number of bds to know whether is a significant deviation .",
    "is helping to fill in the bd parameter space , and with more data its location may become more astrophysically significant .",
    "in this paper , we report the discovery of a bd companion to with a minimum mass of 31.7 @xmath0 2.0 @xmath1 .",
    "this bd , designated , has a moderately long period of @xmath3 days with a low eccentricty of @xmath4 .",
    "we have analyzed moderate resolution spectroscopy of the host star and have determined the following properties : @xmath226,@xmath227 , and [ fe / h ] @xmath228 . from these measurements we find that has a mass and radius of @xmath229 and @xmath11 .",
    "this result combined with photometry , indicates the host star is a g dwarf at 219 @xmath0 21 pc from the sun with an age less than approximately 6 gyr based on an evolutionary track analysis .    due to its moderately long period ,",
    "has a transit probability for a uniform distribution of @xmath142 of only 1.8% .",
    "although we have roughly 13,000 photometric data points , we can not conclusively rule out a transit . in the keck ao imaging no visual companions were found .",
    "however , in the li a previously known companion at 7.7  from the host star was detected .",
    "this visual companion appears in both the 2mass and kic catalogs , and was shown not be a physical companion based upon photometry and astrometry , which is unexpected given that many of the previous bd found by the marvels survey did have tertiary companions .",
    "finally , we found that minimum mass of exists at the minimum of the mass functions of close ( orbital period @xmath230 yr ) stellar and planetary companions to stars , making this a rare object even compared to other bds .",
    "it also exists in an underdense region in both period / eccentricity and metallicity / eccentricity space .",
