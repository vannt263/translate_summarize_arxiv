    "the overall picture emerging at zero temperature is that , as expected , the system adopts mott - insulating ( mi ) phases , when the filling is commensurate with the lattice size and for large enough repulsion between particles , and a superfluid phase ( sf ) otherwise .",
    "the richness of these systems comes from the magnetic behavior of these phases that changes dramatically with the sign of the spin - dependent interaction parameter @xmath5 .    for negative spin - dependent interaction @xmath6 ( see below )",
    "corresponding to the ferromagnetic case , a 1d qmc study @xcite shows that all mott lobes shrink , and eventually disappear , as one increases @xmath7 .",

    "v , we will summarize these results and give some final remarks .",
    "we consider a system of bosonic atoms in the hyperfine state @xmath18 characterized by the magnetic quantum number @xmath19 .",
    "when these atoms are loaded in an optical lattice , the system is governed by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath20 where operator @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) annihilates ( creates ) a boson of spin @xmath23 ( also denoted @xmath24 when needed ) on site @xmath25 of a periodic square lattice of size @xmath26 .    the first term in the hamiltonian is the kinetic term which allows particles to hop between neighboring sites @xmath27 . the hopping parameter @xmath28 sets the energy scale and the number operator @xmath29 counts the total number of bosons on site @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 will denote the total number of @xmath32 bosons , @xmath33 the corresponding density , and @xmath8 the total density .",
    "the operator @xmath34 is the spin operator where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the @xmath37 are standard spin-1 matrices .",
    "once developed , the @xmath38 term exhibits contact interaction terms and conversion terms between the species .",
    "the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath5 are the on - site spin - independent and spin - dependent interaction terms .",
    "the nature of the bosons will give the sign of @xmath5 and consequently the nature of the on - site spin - spin interaction whereas the spin independent part is always repulsive , @xmath40 . the @xmath6 case ( e.g. @xmath2 )",
    "will maximize the local magnetic moment @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , this is referred to as the  ferromagnetic \" case whereas the @xmath17 case ( e.g. @xmath42 ) which favors minimum on - site spins is referred to as ",
    "antiferromagnetic \" .    to simulate this system , we used the stochastic green function algorithm ( sgf ) @xcite with directed updates @xcite , an exact quantum monte carlo technique that allows canonical or grand canonical simulations of the system as well as measurements of many - particle green functions .",
    "in particular , this algorithm can simulate efficiently the spin - flip term @xmath43 which appears in the development of the @xmath44 term . in this work we used mostly the canonical formulation where the total density @xmath8 is conserved whereas the individual densities @xmath45 fluctuate .",
    "the qmc algorithm also conserves the total spin along @xmath12 , @xmath46 , which adds a constraint to the canonical one . the value of @xmath47 in a given canonical simulation is then fixed by the choice of the initial numbers of particles . due to this constraint ,",
    "the magnetic physical quantities , involving @xmath48 operators , are identical for the @xmath49 and @xmath50 axes but may be different for the @xmath12 axis .",
    "the initial symmetry , where all three axes should behave identically , is broken in our simulations .",
    "using this algorithm we were able to simulate the system reliably for clusters going up to @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we generally compared the results for sizes @xmath53 , and 12 to check that there was no appreciable difference in the behaviour of the system within the limit of the precision we could achieve .",
    "at zero temperature , we relate the density to the chemical potential @xmath54 using @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the total number of bosons , and @xmath57 is the average energy , equal to the free energy in the ground state .",

    "the analysis of the magnetic structure requires the equal - time spin - spin correlation functions @xmath61 the global magnetization is given by @xmath62 and the magnetic structure factor by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are integer multiples of @xmath66 .",
    "other important quantities are the diagonal components of the nematic order parameter traceless tensor @xmath67 given by @xcite @xmath68 these are the indicators of the on - site spin isotropy if @xmath69 for all @xmath70 , and of the spin anisotropy characteristic of the nematic order if @xmath71 and if , at the same time , no magnetic order is present . as @xmath72 in our simulations , then @xmath73 and it is sufficient to calculate @xmath74 . since nematic order can develop along any axis and as there is not always an ergodicity breaking in mc simulations on finite clusters , @xmath74 can change sign and average to zero even if it is non - zero in each individual measurements . to avoid such an effect , we use the absolute value of the sums of spin operators in @xmath75 which measure the phase coherence of particles .",
    "the anticorrelated motions of particles , which govern the dynamics inside mott lobes , as the particles of different types exchange their positions are described by the two - particle anticorrelated green functions @xmath76 + if perfect phase coherence is established by means of particle exchange , @xmath77 reaches its limiting upper value of @xmath78 at long distances @xmath79 . due to its definition , @xmath80",

    "several approaches have been used to study this case .",

    "mean field analyses predicted the same magnetic behavior and continuous mi - sf phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the 1d investigation @xcite , by means of qmc simulations , showed that the magnetic local moment on a site with @xmath84 bosons is maximized @xmath85 and that the whole phase diagram is ferromagnetic , in agreement with the above theorem . in the 2d system , studied with variational monte carlo at @xmath15 @xcite , mott and superfluid phases were also found to be ferromagnetic . in the first subsection , we calculate the 2d phase diagram in the @xmath86 plane at a fixed ratio @xmath87 and we discuss the phase transitions in the second subsection .      in the no - hopping limit , @xmath88 ,",
    "the system is in a mi phase with @xmath84 bosons per site with energy per site @xmath89 when @xmath54 satisfies the condition @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the bases of both the odd and even mott lobes , given by @xmath91 , shrink with increasing @xmath7 and disappear completely when @xmath92 . the on - site energy is minimized by maximizing the quantum number @xmath93 corresponding to @xmath94 , that is by adopting any of the @xmath18 triplet states for @xmath15 and any of the @xmath95 quintuplet states for @xmath14 .",
