    "although nova eruptions and dwarf nova outbursts may resemble each other in some cases , the physical mechanisms behind the outbursts are entirely different : a nova eruption arises when hydrogen - rich material accreted onto the surface of a white dwarf ignites under degenerate conditions ( see @xcite for a review ) ; dwarf novae outbursts are thought to result from thermal instabilities associated with hydrogen ionisation in an accretion disc ( see @xcite for a review and @xcite for a detailed parameter study ) .",
    "it is clear that the class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , close binaries containing a white dwarf accreting from a less massive main - sequence companion , provides numerous potential novae progenitors ( pre - novae ) .",
    "in fact , almost all cvs _ should _ suffer nova eruptions repeatedly during their lives . to our knowledge ,",
    "no system became a nova _",
    "after _ it had been classified as a cv .",
    "however , a large number of nova remnants ( post novae ) have been found to be cvs after they attracted attention by erupting ( novae may arise , of course , on a white dwarf accreting hydrogen - rich material in other environments , e.g. in a symbiotic binary ) . among the wide variety of known cv subtypes ,",
    "most post novae were found to have rather high mass transfer rates @xmath1 , and , thus , fall into the class of novalike variables note that the published mass transfer rates were determined generally under the assumption that the disc luminosity arises from viscous dissipation only .",
    "however , irradiation by the hot white dwarf contributes significantly to the observed disc luminosity in young post novae . ] only in a small number of cases were quasiperiodic brightenings observed in post novae , identifying those systems to be dwarf novae @xcite .    in this paper , we analyse the circumstances under which a post nova will evolve into a dwarf nova following the nova eruption . in the next two sections we calculate the irradiation of the accretion disc by the hot white dwarf , and estimate the amount of time required for a post nova to cool to the point that it may begin exhibiting dwarf nova outbursts .",
    "we then discuss our results in the context of the post nova with the best observational coverage to test our predictions   v446her .",
    "( upper curves ) and @xmath2 ( lower curves ) .",
    "the solid lines represent calculations including a boundary layer luminosity corresponding to @xmath3 , whereas the dashed lines are calculated using only the luminosity of the cooling white dwarf . note that @xmath4 corresponds to the end of the hydrogen shell burning phase , which might last for up to @xmath5yr after the actual nova eruption.,width=340 ]",
    "even though a large part of the accreted hydrogen - rich material is ejected during the nova eruption , a significant amount of hydrogen is left over in the remaining envelope , which rapidly returns to hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the nova remnant experiences steady - state hydrogen shell burning until the nuclear fuel is exhausted , and is consequently heated to effective temperatures of several @xmath6k .",
    "the turn - off times of the burning envelope which have been observed with rosat for a small number of novae are of the order of years , e.g. 1.8yr in v1974cyg @xcite and 10yr in gqmus @xcite .",
    "additional support for turn - off times on the order of years comes from monitoring of the ultraviolet luminosity of a number of post novae following their eruption @xcite .",
    "@xcite modelled the evolution of a classical nova through a complete cycle of accretion , outburst , mass loss , decline and resumed accretion . during the decline , the cooling of the white dwarf",
    "can be fit with a power - law of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the luminosity of the white dwarf and @xmath9 the time after the nova explosion .",
    "prialnik s theoretical model is confirmed by @xcite , who derive the cooling rate of the white dwarf using bband observations of the irradiated secondary in v1500cygni and find @xmath10",
    "external irradiation of the disc by the hot central source can suppress the thermal instabilities particularly in the inner disc regions . in the context of soft x - ray transients , @xcite and",
    "@xcite calculate the thermal equilibrium structure of externally irradiated accretion disc annuli assuming that the irradiation flux is thermalized in the photosphere of the disc .",
    "@xcite explains the uv - delay in dwarf novae taking into account irradiation from the white dwarf which truncates the inner disc .",
    "@xcite confirm this claim only for hot white dwarfs ( @xmath11 ) and find that the depletion of the inner disc must create several small outbursts between the main outbursts , contrary to observations .",
    "@xcite explain the low states of vyscl stars as being due to the interplay of irradiation from hot white dwarfs and low mass transfer rates .",
    "for completeness we note that the motivation of @xcite and @xcite was to account for the `` problem of the uv delay '' in dwarf novae , although the effects of irradiation of the inner disc are of general interest for the operation of the accretion disc limit cycle mechanism .",
    "@xcite critically re - examined the basis for the claim of a problem , and finds that there does not seem to be one .",
    "previous studies which had claimed there to be a problem had utilised various simplifications in their time dependent models which turned out to be critical - such as the neglect of a variable outer boundary .",
    "the contraction of the accretion disc during quiescence has the effect of increasing the local surface density in the outer disc , and thereby promoting disc instabilities which begin at large radii .",
    "these so - called `` outside - in '' @xcite or `` type a '' @xcite outbursts in which a narrow spike of enhanced surface density propagates from the initial site of the instability to the inner edge , are able to produce outbursts with the observed delay .    in this work",
    "we calculate the structure of irradiated accretion discs in non - magnetic post novae , taking into account the time dependent flux of the white dwarf cooling down from the hydrogen shell burning phase , as well as the luminosity of the boundary layer resulting from accretion onto the white dwarf .",
    "the luminosity of the white dwarf is given by @xmath12 where  and  denote the radius and the effective temperature of the white dwarf , respectively , and @xmath13 is the stefan - boltzman constant .",
    "the boundary layer luminosity is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant and , as in @xcite and @xcite we take @xmath16 . assuming that the boundary layer luminosity is radiated by the entire surface of the white dwarf and the disc is geometrically thin , the time - dependent flux @xmath17 irradiating the disc at the radius @xmath18 is given by @xmath19,\\ ] ] @xcite , where @xmath20 is the albedo , @xmath21 and @xmath4 at the end of the hydrogen shell burning phase . throughout this paper",
    "we follow @xcite in adopting @xmath22 .",
    "if the irradiation temperature ( @xmath23 ) exceeds @xmath24 the hydrogen in the disc is fully ionised independent of the accretion rate @xcite thus , setting @xmath25 at the outer edge of the disc ( @xmath26 ) gives a limit of the irradiation flux which suppresses the disc instability . using standard equations @xcite and assuming that the outer disc radius @xmath27 is 70% of the primary s roche lobe radius , we obtain the outer radius of the accretion disc as function of the orbital period @xmath28 and the binary mass ratio @xmath29 .",
    "we used @xmath30 for all calculations throughout the paper as we are mainly interested in systems above the period gap .",
    "we can now estimate how long disc instabilities in the accretion discs of post novae are suppressed due to irradiation , where we assume either @xmath31 or @xmath32 , as typical for dwarf novae above the period gap ( for much higher accretion rates , the disc remains in a stable , hot state anyway ) .",
    "fig.1 shows the results for initial temperatures of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "apparently , disc instabilities , and , hence , dwarf nova outbursts , should typically be suppressed for @xmath0550yr , and up to @xmath0100yr if the white dwarf is strongly heated during the nova eruption .",
    "it is also clear that the size of the disc is a crucial parameter : the irradiation from the white dwarf can suppress the instability over the entire disc only for orbital periods @xmath35hr .",
    "the contribution of the boundary layer luminosity becomes important only after @xmath36yr at the earliest .",
    "it is important to note that our results are lower limits on the time scale on which irradiation from the white dwarf suppresses dwarf nova outbursts in post novae for the given disc albedo : ( a ) in order to produce significant dwarf nova outbursts , the disc instability has to affect on considerable parts of the outer disc and not only the outer edge ( we focus on this subject in the next section ) and ( b ) the disc may be flared and therefore intercept more flux from the white dwarf than described by eq.(5 ) , which assumes a flat disc .",
    "accretion disc instabilities and their observational consequence , dwarf nova outbursts , can occur in a non - magnetic cataclysmic variable , if under the assumption of stationary accretion , the disc at its outer rim is colder than the ionisation temperature of hydrogen , @xmath37 . as described above ,",
    "two factors determine the disc temperature at a given radius : the mass transfer rate and the irradiation field from the white dwarf .    while most post novae seem to have no outbursts , a small number of post novae show repetitive optical brightenings that are reminiscent of dwarf nova outbursts @xcite .",
    "the post novae for which this outburst behaviour is best documented are gkper ( = nova per 1901 ) , which shows outbursts of @xmath38mag every @xmath39d , and v446her ( = nova her 1960 ) , which shows outbursts with an amplitude of @xmath40 mag and a recurrence time of @xmath41d @xcite .",

    "the external irradiation temperature necessary to suppress the instability increases with decreasing radius and decreasing @xmath43 ( see eq.(8 ) ) .",
    "note the different scalings.,width=298 ]    the presence of outbursts in gkper is not surprising : the critical mass transfer rate below which outbursts are possible is @xmath46 g s@xmath47 @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the outer disc radius in units of @xmath50 cm and @xmath51 is the primary mass in solar units @xcite .",
    "the large disc size ( @xmath52d ) for gkper means that @xmath53 gs@xmath47 , which ensures that disc instabilities are possible even at very high mass transfer rates and almost independent of the mass transfer rate .",
    "indeed , the outbursts observed in gkper have been successfully modelled within the disc instability scenario @xcite .    by contrast",
    ", v446her has @xmath54h @xcite , which places it among a number of `` normal '' dwarf novae longward of the @xmath55 hr period gap .",
    "the dwarf nova nature of v446her is confirmed by its spectrum which is typical for this class @xcite .",
    "the presence of dwarf nova outbursts in v446her indicates that the accretion rate can not be too high .    in the previous section we assumed that the disc instability is suppressed for @xmath56 , which is a reasonable but somewhat simplified statement .",
    "in order to get more detailed results , we re - derive the accretion rate above which the disc instability is suppressed , @xmath57 , from calculations of the vertical structure of irradiated accretion discs .",
    "our computations are based on the vertical structure code written by one of us ( jkc ) and described in @xcite and @xcite which we have modified to include the effects of external irradiation .",
    "assuming that the external flux is thermalized in the surface layer , we set @xmath58 at the outer boundary , where @xmath59 is the photospheric temperature , @xmath60 the energy flux arising from viscous dissipation and @xmath61 the irradiation temperature defined above ( hameury et al .",
    "we calculate the modified vertical structure for @xmath62\\,m_{\\odot } , \\alpha=[0.005, ...",
    ",1],\\,r=[0.1, ... ,10]\\times10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ ] and @xmath63\\times\\,10 ^ 3\\,\\mathrm{k}$ ] . for the non - irradiated disc ( i.e. @xmath64 ) , we obtain @xmath65 this result is in good agreement with values derived previously @xcite .",
    "fig.2 shows examples of the thermal equilibrium curves for different irradiation temperatures .",
    "irradiation has a significant influence on the ionisation state of the disc for @xmath66 . the critical accretion rate , below which the disc becomes unstable , decreases with increasing irradiation until the external flux becomes strong enough to hold the disc in the hot stable state independent of the accretion rate .",
    "we find that the irradiation temperature @xmath67 for which @xmath57 vanishes is a slightly decreasing function of @xmath49 and @xmath43 , but nearly independent of @xmath51 : @xmath68 the decrease of @xmath57 between the non - irradiated case ( eq.7 ) and the suppression of the instability is approximately given by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath57 given above .",
    "using the result of our parameter study , i.e. @xmath71 , combined with eq.(5 ) and assuming @xmath72k after the nova event , we find that the limit cycle instability can operate now ( i.e. 40yr after the 1960 nova ) only between @xmath73 cm and @xmath74 cm in v446her ( fig.3 )",
    ". this might be enough to produce significant dwarf nova outbursts but the continuing cooling of the white dwarf should lead in the future to an increase of the outburst amplitude as well as to longer quiescence periods .    assuming that the mass transfer rate in v446her is indeed low enough to permit a disc instability limit cycle , we compare now our estimates of irradiation suppression of dwarf nova outbursts with the long - term photometric history of the system .",
    "the pre - nova showed brightness fluctuations between @xmath75 , which bear some resemblance to dwarf nova outbursts , even though the rise time of the single well sampled `` flare '' seems too slow compared to a typical dwarf nova outburst @xcite .",
    "@xcite reports 9 photometric measurements of the post nova obtained between 22 september 1968 , and 26 september 1970 , i.e. 810yr after the nova eruption , all of which show the system at @xmath76 .",
    "finally , the systematic roboscope photometry of @xcite , starting in 1990 , shows v446her at a quiescent magnitude of @xmath77 with regular outbursts reaching @xmath78 .",
    "it appears very unlikely that all of stienon s measurements caught the system at the maximum of an outburst , and we believe that dwarf nova outbursts were suppressed in v446her for at least ten years after the nova eruption in 1960 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know how long the hydrogen shell burning lasted in v446her , and it is not clear at which point between 1970 and 1990 the dwarf nova outbursts resumed .",
    "therefore , we can not give a quantitative estimate of @xmath79 .",
    "the critical accretion rate and the irradiation temperature as a function of time for different disc annuli ( @xmath80\\times\\,10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ ] ) , @xmath81 and @xmath82.,width=340 ]",
    "taken at face value , the decrease of the optical brightness observed in v446her over several decades following the nova eruption and the onset of dwarf nova outbursts @xmath83 decades after the nova eruption could be interpreted simply as a decline of the accretion rate , being higher than the critical accretion rate for at least the first decade after the eruption , and being below the critical rate in the 1990 s .",
    "such a decline of the accretion rate in post novae is the hallmark of the `` hibernation scenario '' , which was invoked by shara et al .",
    "( 1986 , see @xcite for a review ) to solve discrepancies between nova theory and observations and to account for the low observed space density of cvs when compared to the number of nova eruptions in our galaxy or m31 . in the hibernation scenario ,",
    "irradiation of the secondary star by the hot white dwarf should keep the mass transfer rate high after the nova eruption for a limited period of time , after which the mass transfer rate decreases to very low values .",
    "the post novae should , hence , appear at first as a novalike variables ( for many decades to a century ) with stable hot accretion discs , and evolve thereafter into inconspicuous low @xmath1 cvs .",
    "thus , in the hibernation scenario it appears plausible that most `` fresh '' post novae have indeed high accretion rates , and that the oldest recovered novae are intrinsically very faint ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on observational grounds ,",
    "the hibernation scenario has been challenged , e.g. @xcite and @xcite , but obtained also some support : @xcite and @xcite found a gradual decrease in the visual brightness during the final decline of novae and interpret this result as an evidence for a decrease of the mass transfer rate in these systems , consistent with the hibernation scenario .",
    "however , the latter point needs to be considered with some care : as already mentioned in the introduction , irradiation by the hot white dwarf significantly contributes to the observed disc brightness . as the white dwarf cools from the nova outburst , the decreasing amount of irradiation will result in a decrease of the observed disc brightness , and , hence , mimick a decrease of the accretion rate .    a valuable alternative to the hibernation model that can explain at least the fact that only in a small number of cases dwarf nova outbursts were observed in post novae ( and pre novae ) is the mass transfer cycle proposed by @xcite in which the accretion - induced irradiation of the secondary drives a limit cycle with a period of @xmath84yr . in this cycle",
    ", a cv spends similar times in states of high and low accretion rates , appearing as a novalike variable or as a dwarf nova .",
    "it is then clear that the probability that a cv turns into a nova is highest during the phase of high mass transfer , which naturally explains why most post novae are novalike variables . of course",
    ", in some low @xmath1 cvs the accreted envelope will also reach the critical mass for a nova eruption , and v446her might be such a case .    in this scenario",
    ", pre novae and post novae would have the same characteristics , which is in agreement with the analysis of @xcite , who found that in most novae the pre - eruption and post eruption magnitudes are very similar .",
    "we have calculated the effect that irradiation by the heated white dwarf in a post nova has on the structure of an accretion disc .",
    "we find that , even if the accretion rate in such a system is low enough to permit disc instabilities , irradiation from the white dwarf suppresses dwarf nova outbursts for up to @xmath85yr . in the case of v446her",
    "our calculations predict an increase of the outburst amplitude and a decrease of the outburst frequency as the white dwarf keeps on cooling down .",
    "we encourage long - term monitoring of v446her in order to detect any evolution of the outburst pattern .",
