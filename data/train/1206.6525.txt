    "double exchange ( de ) is the key concept in the physics of strongly correlated systems , characterizing the properties of itinerant electrons , traveling in the lattice of localized ( atomic ) spins.@xcite    the situation becomes increasingly interesting when there are several degenerate orbitals , which become involved into the de processes .",
    "typically , each orbital is highly nonspherical and can assist the electron transfer only in some spacial directions , which can differ substantially , depending on the shape of the occupied orbital .",
    "thus , the itinerant electron can `` choose '' the orbital where to reside and , depending on it , choose a path for its traveling in the solid .",
    "of course , the transport properties will crucially depend on such a choice .",
    "moreover , each guess for the orbital configuration has a feedback effect and involves some elements of the self - organization , typically through developing certain magnetic texture , which tends to stabilize the assumed orbital configuration , at least locally .",
    "alternatively , each change of the magnetic state leads to the orbital - selective reconstruction of the electronic structure , which can be sufficient to stabilize the magnetic state.@xcite all these phenomena are largely involved in the physics of pseudocubic perovskite manganites and predetermine the rich variety of their electronic and magnetic properties.@xcite    in this paper we propose that the de physics can lead to a number of interesting effects when it brought in contact with the unusual crystal structure of recently synthesized mixed - valence ( @xmath7 ) nav@xmath0o@xmath1 compound consisting of double chains of edge - sharing vo@xmath2 octahedra ( see fig .",
    "[ afm]).@xcite    the properties of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 are indeed very intriguing .",
    "it has orthorhombic space group @xmath3 , where there are four formula units in the primitive cell , and two nonequivalent vanadium types v1 and v2 , which are numbered as 1 - 4 and 5 - 8 , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ afm]).@xcite the vanadium atoms are surrounded by slightly distorted edge - sharing octahedra which form the zig - zag chains propagating in the @xmath8-direction .    the single - crystalline nav@xmath0o@xmath1 remains metallic down to 40mk .",
    "nevertheless , the low - temperature properties of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 are characterized by the strong anisotropy of the electrical resistivity : @xmath9/@xmath1020 , where the symbols @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand for the directions being parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic @xmath8-axis , respectively . in this sense , nav@xmath0o@xmath1 is regarded as the quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) compound .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath13 ) of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 has a peak at around @xmath14=140 k , indicating at an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition . on the other hand , the fitting of @xmath13 in terms of the curie - weiss law well above @xmath14 yields positive weiss constant , indicating at the predominantly ferromagnetic ( fm ) character of interactions.@xcite furthermore , the anisotropy of electrical resistivity rapidly deteriorates above @xmath14.@xcite these results , together with the metallic character of conductivity along the @xmath8-axis gave rise to a hypothesis that within each zig - zag double - chain , the intrachain interaction should be fm while the interchain interaction is afm ( fig .",
    "[ afm]).@xcite thus , it seems that not only the electrical resistivity , but also the magnetic structure of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 is highly anisotropic and these two anisotropies are coupled to each other .",
    "later on , several attempts to clarify the magnetic structure of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 have been undertaken in the experiments on the neutron scattering,@xcite the muon - spin rotation,@xcite and the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr).@xcite nevertheless , the magnetic structure remains a matter of controversy .",
    "for example , earlier neutron - scattering measurements have been interpreted in terms of the incommensurate spin - density wave order with @xmath15 , in units of @xmath16.@xcite however , more resent muon - spin rotation studies favor the helical magnetic structure , where the magnetic moments lie in the @xmath17 plane and propagate along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "this means that some of the intrachain interactions should be afm , which confronts the hypothesis based on the magnetization measurements.@xcite finally , there are also experimental proposals that nav@xmath0o@xmath1 may exhibit several consequent afm transitions below @xmath14.@xcite    the purpose of this work is to build some theoretical background for understanding these electronic and magnetic properties of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "first , we construct a realistic low - energy model ( sec .",
    "[ method ] ) , which aims to describe the electronic and magnetic properties of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "then , we analyze this model in the mean - field hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation ( sec .  [ results ] ) .",
    "although hf is a crude approximation for metallic systems , we will be able to argue , on a semi - quantitative level , that the main details of the electronic and magnetic structure are well anticipated from such a model analysis and can be attributed to the particular type of the orbital ordering in the metallic state .",
    "once the orbital ordering is established , nav@xmath0o@xmath1 has many things in common with the de systems .",
    "finally , a brief summary will be given in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in our theoretical analysis , we follow the strategy , which was developed in the previous publications and which can be called as `` realistic modeling of strongly correlated systems '' ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "first , we calculate the electronic structure of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 in the local - density - approximation ( lda ) , using the experimental parameters of the crystal structure , measured at @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20 k.@xcite the obtained electronic structure is in a good agreement with the previous calculations.@xcite then , we construct the low - energy hubbard - type model for the @xmath4 bands of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 , located near the fermi level , and derive all parameters of such model from the first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "the details of the computational procedure can be found in ref .  .",
    "in a number of cases , we have also constructed and solved the five - orbital model , which describes the behavior of both @xmath4 and @xmath21 bands of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the model includes three sets of parameters : the crystal field ( cf ) , transfer integrals , and screened coulomb interactions .",
    "the splitting of three @xmath4 levels by the cf has the following structure ( in mev ) : @xmath22 and @xmath23 , at the inequivalent vanadium types v1 and v2 , respectively .",
    "two lowest levels are nearly degenerate and not disrupted by the crystal distortion .",
    "this type of the cf splitting is favored by the de interactions and minimizes the kinetic energy of electrons .",
    "nevertheless , two lower @xmath4 orbitals can still mix with the upper one by the transfer integrals .",
    "this mixing can be relatively strong .",
    "the behavior of some transfer integrals is explained in fig .",
    "[ struct ] , in the local coordinate frame , which diagonalizes the cf hamiltonian .",
    "the largest transfer integrals operate between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) v - atoms in the chains @xmath24-@xmath25 ( @xmath26-@xmath27 ) and @xmath28-@xmath29 ( @xmath30-@xmath31 ) .",
    "the transfer integrals between the chains are somewhat weaker , but still comparable with the ones within the chains .",
    "thus , the structure of transfer integrals in is essentially three - dimensional , and alone does not explains the quasi-1d character of the electronic and magnetic properties of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .    the screened coulomb interactions in the @xmath4-band can be computed in two steps,@xcite by applying the constrained lda and the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for the screening .",
    "roughly speaking , the first techniques takes into account the screening of atomic orbitals , while the second one  the self - screening by the same @xmath32-electrons , which participate in the formation of other bands due to the hybridization effects .",
    "the fitting of screened interactions in terms of two kanamori parameters yields the following characteristic values of the intra - orbital coulomb interaction @xmath33@xmath19 @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) ev and the intraatomic exchange coupling @xmath36@xmath19 @xmath37 ( @xmath37 ) ev , for the vanadium type v1 ( v2).@xcite    all parameters of the model hamiltonian can be found in ref .  .",
    "after the construction , the model is solved in the hf approximation.@xcite since the hf approximation is known to have limitations for the metallic systems , we will also discuss possible impact of correlation interactions on the semi - quantitative level .    before going into details , we would like to emphasize that the analysis of electronic and magnetic properties of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 can be greatly simplified by considering the symmetry aspects .",
    "it appears that besides the cf splitting , which lifts the degeneracy of atomic @xmath4-levels and thus specifies subspace of the occupied orbitals , another important factor is the _ symmetry _ of orbitals , which are obtained from the diagonalization of the cf hamiltonian at each v - site @xmath38 .",
    "they can be schematically denoted as @xmath39 , for the vanadium type v1 ( @xmath38@xmath40-@xmath41 ) , and @xmath42 , for the vanadium type v2 ( @xmath38@xmath43-@xmath30 ) . in the other words , these are the eigenvectors of the cf hamiltonian , which corresponds to the eigenvalues ( the cf splitting ) , listed above . in these notations , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are symmetric and antisymmetric eigenvectors with respect to the mirror reflection @xmath5@xmath6 , which transform each v - site to itself ( with the additional shift by @xmath46 ) . for example , for the inequivalent v - sites 1 and 5 ( see fig .",

    "the fact that two lowest levels , which are split off by the crystal field , belong to different representations ( correspondingly , symmetric and antisymmetric one ) has very important consequences and greatly reduces the number of possible solutions of the electronic model , which we have to consider . indeed , due to the large orbital polarization , which is driven by the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath33",
    ", the local populations of occupied orbitals ( @xmath65 ) , corresponding to the @xmath7 configuration of v - sites , can be either @xmath24 or @xmath66 .",
    "since these orbitals belong to different representations and , therefore , do not mix with each other , we have to consider only four possible hf solutions , corresponding to the following populations of the symmetric and antisymmetric orbitals of the vanadium types v1 and v2 : @xmath67@xmath19 @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , the antisymmetric orbitals at each site will simply coincide with @xmath72 ( the only possible antisymmetric orbitals in the @xmath4 basis ) , while each occupied symmetric orbital is a linear combination of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which is obtained in the process of iterative solution of the hf equations .",
    "finally , for each orbital configuration , we should find the magnetic solution , corresponding to the total energy minimum .",
    "the behavior of nn transfer integrals in the chains can be also understood , by considering the symmetry arguments . since for the edge - sharing geometry of the vo@xmath2 octahedra ,",
    "the main contribution to the nn integrals is caused by the @xmath75 interactions , which are possible only between orbitals of the @xmath76@xmath49@xmath77 and @xmath78@xmath49@xmath51 type , it is reasonable to expect that the transfer integrals in the bonds @xmath24-@xmath25 ( @xmath26-@xmath27 ) and @xmath28-@xmath29 ( @xmath30-@xmath31 ) will be large between symmetric orbitals , which have these components , and small  between antisymmetric ones , which do not have them due to the symmetry constraint .",
    "this is indeed roughly consistent with the behavior of the transfer integrals , depicted in fig .",
    "[ struct ] .",
    "thus , from the viewpoint of the de interactions in the chains , it is more favorable energetically to make the antisymmetric orbitals fully localized ( @xmath65@xmath19@xmath24 ) , and to construct the metallic band from the symmetric orbitals ( @xmath65@xmath19@xmath66 ) .",

    "then , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath87 will be screened by correlation interactions .",
    "for example , such an effect is well known in the theory of the homogeneous electron gas.@xcite similar tendency was found in the total energy calculations for the low - energy model , which was constructed for the series of hm systems : the correlation interactions , treated in rpa , systematically decrease the effective intraatomic spin splitting and , in a number of cases , make this hm state unstable.@xcite thus , it is clear that the reduction of @xmath87 , caused by the metallic screening effects , will strengthen @xmath92 , which is proportional to @xmath99 , and shift the balance of magnetic interactions towards the afm coupling ( of course , provided that the orbital configuration will not change ) .",
    "particularly , in order to make the bonds @xmath24-@xmath100 and @xmath28-@xmath101 antiferromagnetic ( see table  [ tab.dese ] ) , the spin splitting @xmath87 should be reduced by about 40% . then",
    ", if we adopt the same scaling for @xmath96 and note that @xmath94 does not depend on @xmath87 , the ` screened ' nn interaction @xmath102 can be estimated as @xmath103@xmath91@xmath104 mev . in this case",
    ", one can also expect the formation of the helical magnetic state in the chain v1 , which takes place if @xmath105@xmath106 .",
    "thus , the experimental magnetic ordering is closely related to the @xmath791 orbital ordering : at least on the semi - quantitative level , main details of the experimental magnetic structure are reflected in the behavior of interatomic magnetic interactions .",
    "we expect that the quantitative agreement with the experimental data could be obtained if one goes beyond the hf approximation and consider rigorously the correlation interactions .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with calculations of the correlation energy in rpa , by starting from one - electron eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , obtained in the hf approximation .",

    "this tensor is diagonal ( @xmath118 ) , and the components of the resistivity tensor are given simply by @xmath119 .",

    "thus , the resistivity is highly anisotropic , where two components perpendicular to the chains @xmath124 are about 19 - 34 times lager than @xmath125 in the chain .",
    "therefore , the experimentally observed anisotropy of resistivity ( @xmath126 , ref .  ) can be understood already from the viewpoint of the @xmath791 orbital ordering , even without invoking the anisotropic @xmath127 afm arrangement .",
    "the orbital ordering plays a crucial role in the observed anisotropy of the resistivity tensor .",
    "for example , for the @xmath792 orbital ordering , the tensor @xmath128 is nearly isotropic ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "similar behavior is found in the local - spin - density approximation for the hm fm state ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) .    as expected,@xcite",
    "the afm @xmath127 spin alignment additionally enhances the anisotropy of the resistivity tensor , yielding for the @xmath791 orbital ordering @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , one may ask which ordering is more important for the anisotropy of resistivity : spin or orbital one ?",
    "the increase of @xmath134 , in comparison with the fm alignment ( for the same orbital ordering @xmath791 ) , is quite modest .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath135 changes by factor 10 .",
    "therefore , it is tempted to conclude that the antiferromagnetism plays at least the same role in the anisotropy of the electrical resistivity as the orbital ordering .",
    "nevertheless , it should be also remembered that the afm order itself is caused by the orbital order ( or , at least these two orders occur concomitantly ) .",
    "thus , it is probably right to say that this is the orbital ordering , which has twofold effect on the anisotropy of the electrical resistivity : direct , which is observed already in the fm state , and indirect , via formation of the anisotropic afm structure .",
    "on the basis of the first - principles electronic structure calculations , we have derived an effective low - energy model for nav@xmath0o@xmath1 and employed this model for the analysis of electronic and magnetic properties of this material .",
    "the obtained transfer integrals are basically three - dimensional and by themselves do not reproduce the quasi-1d character of the electrical resistivity of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "an additional important ingredient , which yields the anisotropy of electronic and magnetic properties should be the orbital ordering , realized in the metallic state of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we have argued that the symmetry arguments greatly simplify the analysis of the possible orbital states in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 , and the proposed orbital ordering is one of the few candidates , which respects the orthorhombic @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "the afm spin arrangement additionally increases the anisotropy of electrical resistivity .",
    "however , the anisotropy caused by the orbital ordering is comparable with the spin contribution and is formally sufficient for reproducing the experimental value @xmath9/@xmath1020.@xcite moreover , the afm spin ordering itself is driven by the orbital ordering , which increases the fm character of interactions in the chains and weakens the interactions between the chains .",
    "the sizable second - neighbor afm interactions in the chains can be also responsible for the formation of the helical magnetic structure , which was proposed recently.@xcite nevertheless , within the hf approximation , the fm solution was found to be slightly lower in energy than the afm one . in order to resolve this discrepancy , we provided semi - quantitative arguments and argued that the correlation interactions , beyond the hf approximation , should probably reverse this tendency .",
