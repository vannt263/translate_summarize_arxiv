    "the successful standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions is a renormalizable theory , but it still could be just an effective theory of a more fundamental or more complete theory that is yet to be discovered . the goal of the next generation of high energy colliders , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , or the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite , is to probe the origins of electroweak symmetry breaking , and/or discover new physics phenomena .    the apparent suppression of flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) has played a critical role in the establishment of the three generation sm . with just one higgs doublet , by unitarity of the quark mixing matrix ,",
    "the couplings of neutral bosons ( such as the @xmath32 boson , higgs boson , gluon and photon ) to a pair of quarks are flavor diagonal at the tree level . at the one loop level ,",
    "the charged currents ( cc ) do generate fcnc @xmath33 transitions , but they are suppressed by the gim mechanism .",
    "interesting phenomena such as @xmath34 violation that are the current focus at the b factories involve fcnc @xmath35 transitions . because of very strong gim cancellation between @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath14 quark loops , and in part because of an unsuppressed decay width , however , the corresponding top decays are rather suppressed @xcite in the three generation sm , viz .",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 ( 115  130 ) gev has been taken .",
    "together with the expectation @xmath40 , such strong suppression within three generation sm implies that these processes are excellent probes for new physics , such as supersymmetry , extended higgs sector , or extra fermion families .    in the last decade , there has been intense activities to explore fcnc involving the top quark .",
    "experimentally , cdf , d0 @xcite and lepii @xcite collaborations have reported interesting bounds on fcnc top decays .",
    "these bounds are rather weak , however , but will improve in the coming years , first with tevatron run ii , in a few years with the lhc , and eventually at the ilc .",
    "the expected sensitivity to top fcnc at tevatron run ii is about @xmath41 , while at the lhc , with one year of running , it is possible to probe the range @xcite , @xmath42 at the ilc , the sensitivity is slightly less @xcite , and the range @xmath43 can be probed .",
    "thus , models which can enhance these fcnc rates and bring them close to the above sensitivities are welcome .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "many sm extensions predict that top and @xmath32 fcnc rates can be orders of magnitude larger than their sm values ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study fcnc involving heavy quarks in the more modest extension of sm by adding a sequential fourth generation .",
    "this retains all the features of sm , except bringing into existence the heavy quarks @xmath16 and @xmath21 .",
    "we will first cover the impact on fcnc top decays : @xmath44 .",
    "we find that a 4th generation still can not bring these decay rates to within experimental sensitivity , once constraints from rare @xmath45 decays are imposed . likewise ,",
    "as discussed in a later section , fcnc decays of the z boson , e.g. @xmath46 , also remain difficult .",
    "with lhc in view , however , it is timely to address the decay and detection of 4th generation quarks @xmath7 and @xmath8 themselves . for this matter",
    ", we include in our analysis both cc decays as well as fcnc @xmath47 and @xmath48 decays , and evaluate the total widths and branching ratios .",
    "we illustrate the search strategies at the lhc ( and tevatron run - ii ) , and find that fcnc decays are typically at the @xmath49@xmath50 order , and should be detectable at the lhc . for a relatively light @xmath16 just above 200 gev , fcnc @xmath16 decays could still dominate ! for completeness , we also study the signature of these fcnc couplings at @xmath51 colliders through heavy and light quark associated production , i.e. fcnc @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    before we turn to our detailed study , we should address the issue as to whether a 4th generation itself is relevant at all .",
    "let us first start with the original motivation for considering a 4th generation . despite its great success , the 3 generation standard model ( sm3 ) may be incomplete . the generation structure ( including the question of  why 3 ? \" ) is simply not understood , while having just one heavy quark , the top , with mass at the weak scale is also puzzling .",
    "a simple enlargement of sm3 by adding a sequential fourth generation ( sm4 ) , where we have already used the notation of @xmath56 for the fourth generation quarks , could allow us to gain further insight into the question of flavor .",
    "the question that immediately arises is neutrino counting via the invisible @xmath32 width  @xcite .",
    "indeed , one of the original strong motivations for the 4th generation , before the advent of the @xmath57 result from sld and lep experiments , was the possibility of the 4th neutral lepton as a dark matter ( dm ) candidate .",
    "but with active neutrino number @xmath57 convincingly established at 3 , since 1989 the 4th generation as a whole fell out of favor .",
    "recent observations of neutrino oscillations , however , point toward an enlarged neutrino sector  @xcite , which by itself must be beyond minimal sm3 . for example",
    ", it has been demonstrated recently  @xcite that , if the right - handed neutrino majorana mass scale is of the order @xmath58 ( ev ) , dubbed ",
    "ev seesaw \" , a fit to lsnd data @xcite can be obtained . within such ev seesaw scenario , unlike the very high scale standard seesaw , extension to the fourth generation can be easily accomplished . in a recent work @xcite , it has been shown that such ev seesaw can be extended to four lepton generations . the 4th  neutrino \" or neutral lepton @xmath59 is pseudo - dirac and heavy , so it does not affect the invisible @xmath32 width .",
    "the 3 extra sterile neutrinos allow one to accommodate lsnd data . taking this as a plausible scenario that @xmath60 is no longer an impediment to having a 4th generation",
    ", we will not discuss the lepton sector any further in this work .",
    "the second , rather serious issue to face is about precision electroweak constraints , which seem to pose a challenge to the fourth generation . in particular ,  an extra generation of ordinary fermions is excluded at the 99.95% cl on the basis of the @xmath61 parameter alone \"  @xcite , and efforts to reduce @xmath61 tend to increase @xmath62 . with @xmath63 , @xmath64 for @xmath65 gev ,",
    "the problem is serious for many extensions beyond sm3 , such as technicolor , or sm4  @xcite .",
    "even so , for sm4 , if the extra neutrino is close to its direct mass limit of @xmath66 , this can drive @xmath61 smaller at the expense of a larger @xmath62 , and a more detailed analysis suggest a 4th generation is not ruled out  @xcite .",
    "if a 4th generation exists , it will appear soon .",
    "the effort of this paper is to update @xmath16 and @xmath21 decays , including the often dominant charged current decay , to facilitate the search program at tevatron and lhc .",
    "the lhc would either discover the fourth generation and measure some the fcnc rates , or rule out the fourth generation conclusively .",
    "in this vein , we mention that there are possible hints for the 4th generation from fcnc and @xmath34 violating ( cpv ) @xmath35 transitions at the b factories .",
    "the difference in measured  @xcite direct cpv in @xmath67 and @xmath68 modes could arise from new physics phase in the electroweak penguin process , and the 4th generation is an excellent candidate  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the well - known hint  @xcite of a difference between mixing dependent cpv measurements in a host of charmless @xmath69 type of modes vs @xmath70 , dubbed the @xmath71 problem , could also be partially explained by 4th generation cpv effect through electroweak penguin amplitude  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the fourth generation is not ruled out , may be hinted at in fcnc / cpv @xmath35 transition data , and @xmath16 and @xmath21 search at the tevatron and especially the lhc is imperative .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we review the experimental constraints from electroweak precision tests , @xmath72 , and from fcnc @xmath35 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 transitions . in section 3",
    "we study fcnc @xmath75 decays , and in section 4 @xmath76 , @xmath77 decays , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in section 5",
    "we investigate the associated production @xmath80 , for @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 at ( super)b factories , possible gigaz , and the future ilc collider .",
    "after some discussions in section 6 , our conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "an appendix deals briefly with suppressed fcnc @xmath85 and @xmath86 decays .",
    "with additional quark mixing elements , one crucial aspect is that the source for @xmath34 violation ( cpv ) is no longer unique . consideration of cpv phases is important , as it enlarges the allowed parameter space from low energy considerations  @xcite . existing experimental data as well as theoretical arguments put stringent constraints on the masses and mixings involving the fourth generation ,",
    "some of which will be reviewed here .      adding a fourth family enlarges the ckm quark mixing matrix , and the present constraint on the various ckm elements @xmath87 for sm3 ( i.e. @xmath88@xmath89 ) that are known only indirectly , are considerably relaxed @xcite .",
    "put in other words , flavor physics data do not preclude a 4th generation .",
    "for example , the elements @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be as large as about 0.11 and 0.08 , respectively @xcite . constraints on ckm elements involving the 4th generation is rather weak .",
    "for example , unitarity of the first row of @xmath92 allows @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the long standing puzzle of ( some deficit in ) unitarity of the first row could be taken as a hint for finite @xmath94 .",
    "experimental search for fourth generation quarks has been conducted by several experiments .",
    "these experimental searches clearly depend strongly on the decay pattern of the fourth generation . a strict bound on @xmath7 mass comes from lep experiments , @xmath95 gev @xcite , where both cc and fcnc decays of @xmath7 has been considered .    at the tevatron , where the heavy top quark was discovered ,",
    "both cdf and d0 have searched for fourth generation quarks .",
    "the top quark search applies to @xmath16 and @xmath21 quarks that decay predominantly into @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) , and the corresponding lower bounds are @xmath98 gev  @xcite . searching for @xmath7 quark through",
    "its fcnc decays , an analysis by d0 excludes the @xmath16 in the mass range @xmath99 that decays via the fcnc @xmath100 process  @xcite .",
    "cdf excludes @xcite the @xmath16 quark in the mass range of 100 gev @xmath101 gev at 95% c.l .",
    ", if @xmath102 .",
    "assuming @xmath103 , cdf also excluded long - lived @xmath16 quark with mass in the range @xmath104 gev and a lifetime of @xmath105 s @xcite .",
    "recently , cdf has looked for long - lived fourth generation quarks in a data sample of 90 pb@xmath106 in @xmath107 tev @xmath108 collisions , by using signatures of muon - like penetration and anomalously high ionization energy loss .",
    "the corresponding lower bounds are @xmath109 and @xmath110 gev  @xcite .",
    "the above limits can be relaxed if we consider the possibility that @xmath111 , @xmath96 and @xmath112 decays can be of comparable size under certain conditions of the ckm elements  @xcite . unless associated ckm elements are extremely small , in general the @xmath7 ( and certainly the @xmath8 ) quark should not be very long - lived .",
    "theoretical considerations of unitarity and vacuum stability can put limits on the masses of the fourth generation quarks  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the fourth family is close to degenerate , perturbativity requires @xmath114 gev .",
    "even so , for @xmath7 and @xmath8 below several hundred gev that we consider , the @xmath115 parameter provides a significant constraint on the splitting between @xmath21 and @xmath16 , @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "we note that , having the extra neutral lepton close to the current bound of @xmath117 could be accommodated by electroweak data  @xcite , which has now moved  @xcite much more favorably towards a 4th generation , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the @xmath32 width is now well measured and provides a good constraint . in particular",
    ", @xmath8 can contribute to @xmath2 at one loop level .",
    "for fixed @xmath118 mass , @xmath119 can be constrained .",

    "but the bound can be relaxed if @xmath8 is close to the top quark in mass . in such case",
    ", we may still expect large mixing between the third and fourth generation @xmath125 .",
    "let us now consider the constraints from @xmath35 transitions such as @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite . to study these transitions ,",
    "we will not use any particular parameterization of the ckm matrix .",
