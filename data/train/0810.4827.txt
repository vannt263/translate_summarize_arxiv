    "in recent years , there is growing interest in the electronic properties of surfaces and interfaces of strongly correlated materials.@xcite for instance , the discrepancy between photoemission spectra and theoretically derived bulk spectra of a number of transition - metal oxides has been attributed to changes in the electronic structure at the surface of these materials.@xcite regarding the interface , heterostructures made out of thin atomic layers of perovskite - type oxides have been the target of intense study as promising candidates for electron - correlation - based devices.@xcite a well - known example is the interface between latio@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 , which exhibits metallic behavior in spite of the fact that the two constituent bulk materials are insulators.@xcite    on the theoretical side , inhomogeneous layered systems have been studied by several authors within the dynamical mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) , which contributed significantly in the last decade to the understanding of a variety of strongly correlated bulk materials.@xcite potthoff and nolting investigated the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) at the surface of the single - band hubbard model.@xcite liebsch studied the @xmath1 valence bands of perovskite - type oxides such as srvo@xmath0 by using a three - band tight - binding hamiltonian and showed that electrons at the surface are more strongly correlated than in the bulk due to the reduction of the effective surface band width.@xcite helmes _ et al . _ considered a metal - insulator interface within the single - band hubbard model and studied the scaling behavior of the metallic penetration depth into the mott insulator near the critical coulomb energy.@xcite okamoto and millis investigated the electronic structure of heterostructures in which a finite number of mott - insulator layers were sandwiched between band insulators.@xcite analogous calculations for heterostructures consisting of correlated model systems were also carried out by kancharla and dagotto@xcite and regg _",
    "et al._@xcite modulation doping effects at heterojunctions were investigated by oka and nagaosa@xcite , lee and macdonald@xcite and gonzlez _ et al._@xcite electron transport through a nano - size correlated - electron system connected to metal electrodes was studied by combining dmft and a non - equilibrium green - function technique.@xcite    to solve the dmft equation for inhomogeneous layered systems one needs to construct the lattice green function of surfaces or interfaces consisting of an infinite number of atomic layers . while this is feasible within a linearized version of dmft,@xcite for a complete numerical solution of the dmft equation most previous calculations employed a slab model consisting of a finite number of layers to simulate the system .",
    "although finite - size effects can be reduced by systematically increasing the number of layers , the one - electron density of states ( dos ) projected on each layer converges rather slowly with increasing number of layers since the energy levels in the normal direction are discrete .",
    "hence , it is desirable to develop a method for solving the dmft equation for truly semi - infinite surfaces and interfaces between two semi - infinite materials .",
    "chen and freericks solved the dmft equation for a thin doped mott insulator sandwiched between two semi - infinite metals by applying the quantum zipper algorithm to the falikov - kimball hamiltonian.@xcite in the present work we pursue a different approach by extending the concept of tight - binding embedding , originally developed for the evaluation of the electronic properties of defects in solids , to the dmft for inhomogeneous layered systems .",
    "we employ a localized basis set to describe the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the heterostructure is divided into a central interface region containing a finite number of atomic layers , @xmath2 , and two adjacent semi - infinite bulk regions coupled to @xmath2 .",
    "the interface region is assumed to include the first few surface layers of the actual substrates .",
    "both the central region and the substrates may exhibit strong correlation effects . within the one - electron approximation ,",
    "the effects of an adjacent semi - infinite system on @xmath2 can be expressed as a complex energy - dependent potential acting on the hamiltonian matrix of @xmath2 , which is called `` tight - binding embedding potential''.@xcite the same quantity is called `` contact self - energy '' in transport theory based on the non - equilibrium green function formalism.@xcite here , we extend this embedding approach in order to include coulomb correlations in the substrate within the single - site dmft .",
    "thus , the energy - dependent embedding potential accounts for one - electron and many - body effects within the substrates .",
    "the advantage of this extension is that the layer - coupled dmft equation for a non - periodic surface or interface system made up of an infinite number of atomic layers is greatly simplified since only a small number of layers belonging to @xmath2 needs to be treated explicitly .",
    "the embedding potential is derived from a separate dmft calculation for the adjacent bulk systems .",

    "the one - electron hamiltonian may be derived , for example , from a first - principles electronic - structure calculation within density - functional theory through the use of maximally localized wannier functions.@xcite    in the present work we consider onsite coulomb interactions , @xmath23 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are located on the same site , and in addition , @xmath17 and @xmath24 ( @xmath18 and @xmath25 ) have the same spin .",

    "the limiting value of the self - energy at low @xmath182 is more than one order of magnitude larger than at the surface , implying correspondingly shorter electronic lifetime and lower quasi - particle weight @xmath145 .",
    "thus , apart from a weak exponential bad - metallic tail , the mott gap of the insulating film is virtually impenetrable .",
    "electron transport through correlated - electron systems such as oxide heterostructures and molecules is emerging as an active field of theoretical studies.@xcite to our knowledge , previous studies considered only non - interacting metal leads connected to a central region with coulomb interactions .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the transport theory to the case of interacting metal leads as those shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "we have presented an efficient embedding scheme for performing dmft calculations for inhomogeneous layered systems such as semi - infinite surfaces and heterostructures .",
    "in contrast to previous embedding theories based on tight - binding basis functions , the embedding potential introduced here is determined from a separate dmft calculation for the bulk substrate materials .",
    "it therefore incorporates not only the one - electron properties but also the many - body effects of the semi - infinite systems .",
    "the interface region in which local coulomb interactions are treated self - consistently via the layer - coupled dmft also includes the first few layers of the actual substrates . as examples ,",
    "we have presented numerical results for several surfaces and interfaces of the single - band hubbard model .",
    "these results demonstrate that the represention of the semi - infinite correlated substrates in terms of complex energy - dependent embedding potentials greatly reduces the numerical effort since only a small number of layers needs to be explicitly included in the layer - coupled dmft equation .",
    "thus , the study of neutral as well as charged heterostructures involving realistic strongly correlated multi - band materials becomes feasible .",
