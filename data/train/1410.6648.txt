    "the concepts of dependence and independence are ubiquitous in many scientific disciplines such as experimental physics , social choice theory , computer science , and cryptography . dependence logic @xmath3@xcite and",
    "its so - called team semantics have given rise to a new logical framework in which various notions of dependence and independence can be formalized and studied .",
    "dependence logic extends first - order logic by dependence atoms @xmath4 expressing that the value of the variable @xmath5 is functionally dependent on the values of @xmath6 .",
    "the formulas of dependence logic are evaluated over _ teams _ ,",
    "i.e. , sets of assignments , and not over single assignments as in first - order logic .    in @xcite a modal variant of dependence logic @xmath0was introduced . in the modal framework teams are sets of worlds , and a dependence atom @xmath7 holds in a team @xmath8 if there is a boolean function that determines the value of the propositional variable @xmath9 from those of @xmath10 in all worlds in @xmath8 .",
    "one of the fundamental properties of @xmath0(and of dependence logic ) is that its formulas satisfy the so - called downwards closure property : if @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , then @xmath13 .",
    "still , the modal framework is very different from the first - order one , e.g. , dependence atoms between propositional variables can be eliminated with the help of the classical disjunction @xmath14 @xcite . on the other hand , it was recently shown that eliminating dependence atoms using disjunction causes an exponential blow - up in the formula size , that is , any formula of @xmath15 logically equivalent to the atom in is bound to have length exponential in @xmath16 @xcite . the central complexity theoretic questions regarding @xmath0have been solved in @xcite .",
    "extended modal dependence logic , @xmath17 , was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this extension is defined simply by allowing @xmath18formulas to appear inside dependence atoms , instead of only propositions .",
    "@xmath17can be seen as the first step towards combining dependencies with temporal reasoning .",
    "@xmath17is strictly more expressive than @xmath0but its formulas still have the downwards closure property . in fact , @xmath17has recently been shown to be equivalent to the logic @xmath15 @xcite .    in the first - order case ,",
    "several interesting variants of the dependence atoms have been introduced and studied .",
    "the focus has been on independence atoms @xmath19 and inclusion atoms @xmath20 which were introduced in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the intuitive meaning of the independence atom is that the variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent of each other for any fixed value of @xmath23 , whereas the inclusion atom declares that all values of the tuple @xmath24 appear also as values of @xmath25 . in @xcite a modal variant , @xmath26 , of independence logic",
    "was introduced .",
    "the logic @xmath26contains @xmath0as a proper sublogic , in particular , its formulas do not in general have the downwards closure property . in @xcite",
    "it was also noted that all @xmath26formulas are invariant under bisimulation when this notion is lifted from single worlds to a relation between sets of words in a natural way . at the same time ( independently ) in @xcite it was shown that @xmath17and @xmath15 can express exactly those properties of kripke structures and teams that are downwards closed and invariant under @xmath27-bisimulation for some @xmath28 .    a famous theorem by johan van benthem @xcite states that modal logic is exactly the fragment of first - order logic that is invariant under ( full ) bisimulation .",
    "in this paper we study the analogues of this theorem in the context of team semantics .",
    "our main result shows that an analogue of the van benthem theorem for team semantics can be obtained by replacing @xmath18by _ modal team logic _ ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "@xmath1was introduced in  @xcite and extends @xmath18(and @xmath0 ) by classical negation @xmath29 .",
    "more precisely , we show that for any team property @xmath30 the following are equivalent :    a.

[ enum : main theorem : bisimulation invariant and local ] @xmath30 is bisimulation - invariant and local .",
    "we also study whether all bisimulation invariant properties can be captured by natural variants of @xmath17 .",
    "we consider extended modal independence and extended modal inclusion logic ( @xmath31and @xmath32 , respectively ) , which are obtained from @xmath17by replacing the dependence atom with the independence ( resp .",
    "inclusion ) atom .",
    "we show that both of these logics fail to capture all bisimulation invariant properties , and therefore in particular are strictly weaker than @xmath1 . on the other hand , we show that @xmath33 ( @xmath32extended with classical disjunction ) is in fact as expressive as @xmath34 , but the analogously defined @xmath35 is strictly weaker .",
    "finally , we show that the extension @xmath36 of @xmath18by all first - order definable generalized dependence atoms ( see @xcite ) gives rise to a logic that is as well equivalent to @xmath1 .",

    "a _ team _ of a model @xmath41 as above is simply a set @xmath42 .",
    "the central basic concept underlying vnnen s modal dependence logic and all its variants is that modal formulas are evaluated not in a world but in a team .",
    "this is made precise in the following definitions .",
    "we first recall the usual syntax of modal logic @xmath18 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a propositional variable .",
    "note that we consider only formulas in negation normal form , i.e. , negation appears only in front of atoms . as will become clear from the definition of team semantics of @xmath18 , that we present next , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are not dual formulas , consequently _ tertium non datur _ does not hold in the sense that it is possible that @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( however , we still have that @xmath48 for all models @xmath41 and teams @xmath8 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in @xcite , the connective @xmath49 is allowed to appear freely in @xmath0formulas ( with semantics generalizing the atomic negation case of definition  [ def : semanticsml ] below , note that classical negation as allowed in @xmath1is not allowed in @xmath0 ) .",
    "the well - known dualities from classical modal logic are also true for @xmath0formulas hence any @xmath18-formula ( even @xmath0 ) can be rewritten in such a way that @xmath49 only appears in front of propositional variables .",

    "analogously to the first - order setting , @xmath72-formulas satisfy the following _ flatness _ property  @xcite . here , the notation @xmath73 in item  [ enum : flatness individual worlds ] refers to the standard semantics of modal logic ( without teams ) .",

    "note that @xmath87 is not a global operator stating existence of a world anywhere in the model , but @xmath87 is evaluated in the current team .",
    "it is easy to see ( and follows from proposition  [ proposition : team bisimulation implies equivalence ] ) that a global `` exists '' operator can not be expressed in @xmath1 .",
