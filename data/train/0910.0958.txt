    "there has recently been a renewal of interest in the properties of diquarks in hadronic systems , as they may play an important role in the existence of exotic states , such as the @xmath0 , or in explaining the scarcity of such exotics @xcite .",
    "while string - type models consisting of a quark plus a diquark have been studied using various analytic techniques ( see @xcite for a review ) , there have only been a few studies of this type of system on the lattice .",
    "these studies have investigated the mass of diquarks @xcite , and , more recently , the nature of diquark correlations @xcite .",
    "recently we investigated the formation of flux tubes in static baryon systems on the lattice using a high statistics approach which enabled us to observe correlations between the vacuum action density and the quark positions in a gauge independent manner @xcite in that work the three quarks were positioned approximately equidistant , and a y - shaped flux - tube was observed to form at large inter - quark distances . in this work we extend our study of three quark systems to the case where two of the quarks are close together and the third is some distance away .",
    "in qcd , two quarks close together , a diquark , can transform either according to the conjugate representation @xmath1 or the sextet @xmath2 representation of @xmath3 .",
    "the color hyperfine interaction then leads to attraction in the spin singlet , scalar diquark channel , while the spin triplet , axial vector diquark is disfavoured .",
    "hence low - lying diquarks should have positive parity and belong to the color @xmath4 representation , and so have many properties similar to an antiquark . in lattice qcd this should lead to the formation of quark - diquark flux tubes with similar physical characteristics to those of quark - antiquark flux tubes .",
    "in particular we would expect the long range linear part of the quark - diquark potential to have the same slope as that of the quark - antiquark potential , corresponding to the flux tubes having the same energy density , and we would expect the flux tubes to have similar transverse size . in this work",
    "we investigate whether these similarities do indeed hold .",
    "in order to study flux - tubes on the lattice , we begin with the standard approach of connecting static quark ( and antiquark ) propagators with spatial - link paths in a gauge invariant manner .",
    "we use ape - smeared spatial - link paths to propagate the quarks from a common origin to their spatial positions as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ staple ] . in earlier work we saw that after approximately 30 ape smearing steps we had obtained optimal overlap with the ground state .",
    "the static quark propagators are constructed from time directed link products at fixed spatial coordinate , @xmath5 , using the untouched ` thin ' links of the gauge configuration . in principle , the ground state is isolated after sufficient time evolution .",
    "finally smeared - link spatial paths propagate the quarks back to the common spatial origin .",
    "the three - quark wilson loop is thus defined as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a staple made of path - ordered link variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the path along a given staple as shown in fig .  [ staple ] .",
    "in contrast the quark - antiquark wilson loop is given by the product of two staples @xmath10    , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , forming a three - quark wilson loop with the quarks located at @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 denote colour anti - symmetrisation at the source and sink respectively , while @xmath18 indicates evolution of the three - quark system in euclidean time.,height=377 ]    the three - quark configurations we use to approximate a quark - diquark string are t - shapes , with the origin at the junction of the t. two quarks are positioned one lattice step in opposite directions from the origin ( approximating the diquark ) , and the third is placed from 1 to 12 lattice steps in an orthogonal direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tpath ] .    -@xmath19 plane.,width=302 ]    in this work we have used 300 quenched qcd gauge field configurations created with the @xmath20-mean - field improved luscher - weisz plaquette plus rectangle gauge action @xcite on @xmath21 lattices with the long dimension being the @xmath22 direction , making the spatial volume @xmath23 .",
    "two hundred of these configurations were at at @xmath24 ( as in our previous work ) and one hundred at @xmath25 , to investigate the use of a finer lattice .",
    "these values of @xmath26 give lattice spacings @xmath27 of @xmath28 fm and @xmath29 fm respectively .",
    "we use lattice symmetries to improve the signal to noise ratio of our measurements .",
    "these include translational invariance ( any point on the lattice can be taken as the origin ) , reflection in the @xmath22 plane and @xmath30 rotational symmetry about the @xmath22-axis .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we do not have to perform any gauge fixing to find a signal in our flux distributions .",
    "we characterise the gluon - field fluctuations in our configurations using the gauge - invariant action density @xmath31 observed at spatial coordinate @xmath32 and euclidean time @xmath33 relative to the origin of the wilson loop .",
    "we calculate the action density using the highly - improved @xmath34 three - loop improved lattice field - strength tensor @xcite on four - sweep ape - smeared gauge links .",
    "while the use of this highly - improved action suppresses correlations close to the quark positions , it gives good resolution of the flux - tube correlations we are interested in .",
    "defining the quark positions as @xmath35 relative to the origin of the wilson loop , and denoting the euclidean time extent of the loop by @xmath18 , we evaluate the following correlation functions @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes averaging over configurations and lattice symmetries .",
    "these correlate the quark positions , via the wilson loops , with the gauge - field action in a gauge invariant manner . for fixed quark positions and euclidean time , the correlation functions are scalar fields in three dimensions . for values of @xmath32 well away from the quark positions @xmath35 , there are no correlations and @xmath38 . also the correlators are positive definite , eliminating any sign ambiguity on whether vacuum field fluctuations are enhanced or suppressed in the presence of static quarks .",
    "we find that @xmath39 is generally less than 1 , signaling the expulsion of vacuum fluctuations from the interior of hadrons .    in figs .",
    "[ t - tube10 ] and  [ i - tube12 ] we show examples of the expulsion of vacuum fluctuations and the formation of flux - tubes for our quark - diquark and quark - antiquark configurations .     is illustrated by the translucent surface .",

    "in this section we extract the long range portion of the potential for our quark - antiquark and quark - diquark flux - tubes . according to qcd",
    ", the effective potentials should have the same slope , so long as the ape smearing in the spatial directions has smoothed the gluon fluctuations sufficiently to isolate the ground state and the propagation of the wilson loops in the time direction is long enough for any excited states to decay .",

    "we can gain further insight into the properties of the flux tubes by examining their profiles close to the quark .",
    "we study the values of the correlators @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 is constrained to the plane of the color sources , and the origin is at the position of either the antiquark or the join of the t. the quark is then at the position @xmath57 where @xmath58 varies from 1 to 12 lattice steps .",
    "first we examine the longitudinal profiles of both quark - diquark and quark - antiquark flux - tubes along the line @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ longprofiles ] .",
    "as expected , the vacuum expulsion close to the diquark is stronger than in the vicinity of the antiquark .",
    "however , near the quark the two flux tubes show very similar profiles .",

    "[ trprofiles ] we show profiles of both quark - diquark and quark - antiquark flux - tubes for @xmath63 .",
    "we find that as long as @xmath58 is larger than one third of the total length of the quark - antiquark system , the transverse profiles are close to identical .",
    "( solid lines ) and @xmath43 ( dashed lines).,width=302 ]    the transverse profile of the flux - tube is fitted well by a gaussian function @xmath64 .",
    "the fit enables us to estimate the radius @xmath65 and area @xmath66 of the flux - tube as well as its depth .",
    "the fit parameters for our flux tubes are given in table  [ flux - fit ] .",

    "we have directly compared gluon flux - tubes for quark plus antiquark and three quark systems . in the three quark systems we kept two quarks close together ( two lattice units separation ) , so that the system would approximate a quark - diquark string .",
    "we found that the string tension in the quark - diquark string was the same as for the quark - antiquark string .",
    "in addition we compared the vacuum expulsion in both sets of flux - tubes .",
    "we found that , in the vicinity of the quark , there was no measurable difference between the transverse profiles of the quark - diquark flux - tubes and the quark - antiquark flux - tubes . also the longitudinal profiles of both sets of flux - tubes were very similar .",
    "these findings confirm the expectation from qcd that a diquark has many properties in common with an antiquark .",
    "in particular the long range color interaction between a diquark and a quark is seen to be the same as that between an antiquark and a quark .",
    "this result is interesting in that it is obtained in the quenched approximation , where the color hyperfine interaction should be small .",
    "this implies that the ape smearing and propagation in euclidean time we have performed has been sufficient for decuplet baryon states to decay",
