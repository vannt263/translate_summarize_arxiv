    "dense packings of hard particles have served as useful models to understand the structure of low - temperature states of matter , such as liquids , glasses , and crystals @xcite , granular media @xcite , heterogeneous materials @xcite , and biological systems ( e.g. , tissue structure , cell membranes , and phyllotaxis ) @xcite .",
    "much of what we know about dense packings concerns particles of spherical shape @xcite , and hence it is useful to summarize key aspects of the _ geometric - structure _ classification of sphere packings @xcite in order to place our results for dense packings of nonspherical particles in their proper context .",
    "the geometric - structure classification naturally emphasizes that there is a great diversity in the types of attainable jammed sphere packings with varying magnitudes of overall order ( characterized by scalar order metric @xmath0 that lies in the interval @xmath1 $ ] ) , packing fraction @xmath2 , and other intensive parameters ( e.g , mean contact number ) @xcite .",
    "the notions of `` order maps '' @xcite in combination with mathematically precise `` jamming categories '' @xcite enable one to view and characterize well - known packing states , such as the densest sphere packing ( kepler s conjecture ) @xcite and maximally random jammed ( mrj ) packings as extremal states in the order map for a given jamming category @xcite .",
    "indeed , this picture encompasses not only these special jammed states , but an uncountably infinite number of other packings , some of which have only recently been identified as physically significant , e.g. , the jamming - threshold states ( least dense jammed packings ) @xcite as well as extremal states between these and the mrj point @xcite .",

    "the focus of the present paper is on the densest packings of _ congruent _ nonspherical particles , both convex and concave shapes .",
    "we will show that both the symmetry and local principal curvatures of the particle surface play a crucial role in how the rotational degrees of freedom couple with the translational degrees of freedom to determine the maximal - density configurations .",
    "thus , different particle shapes will possess maximal - density configurations with generally different packing characteristics .",
    "we have recently devised organizing principles ( in the form of conjectures ) to obtain maximally dense packings of a certain class of convex nonspherical hard particles @xcite .",
    "interestingly , our conjecture for certain centrally symmetric polyhedra have been confirmed experimentally very recently @xcite .",
    "here we generalize these organizing principles to other convex particles as well as concave shapes @xcite .",

    "tunability capability via particle shape provides a means to design novel crystal , liquid and glassy states of matter that are richer than can be achieved with spheres ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . while it is seen that hard spheres exhibit entropically driven disorder - order transitions , metastable disordered states , glassy jammed states , and ordered jammed states with maximal density , the corresponding phase diagram for hard nonspherical particles will generally be considerably richer in complexity due to the rotational degrees of freedom and smoothness of the particle surface ( see sec .",

    "this leads to a bravais - lattice packing ( defined in sec .",
    "ii ) of the centrally symmetric particle under consideration . a key element in his argument is the fact that local optimality is consistent with the global optimality in two dimensions ( e.g. , a centrally symmetric hexagon can always tessellate the space ) , which unfortunately generally does not hold in three dimensions . for convex particles in @xmath5 without central symmetry , kuperberg and",
    "kuperberg @xcite showed that dense packings of a specific particle can be obtained by constructing a _",
    "double - lattice _ packing of the particle , i.e. , a packing composed of a bravais - lattice packing of the particle itself and a lattice packing of the center - inversion image of the particle .",
    "they showed that the maximal - density double - lattice packing of a specific shape can be obtained by minimizing the area of certain parallelogram associated with the packing @xcite .",
    "we note that the double - lattice packing amounts to a bravais - lattice packing of a centrally symmetric dimer ( i.e. , pair ) of the original particles .",
    "generalizing the aforementioned organizing principles to three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath4 , which is fundamentally different from @xmath5 , is highly nontrivial . in @xmath5 , obtaining the maximally dense packing of a specific particle shape can usually be reduced to a local problem , because the densest local clusters of the particles are frequently consistent with the globally densest packing .",
    "however , this principle generally does not apply in @xmath4 , since the densest local packing clusters are usually `` geometrically frustrated '' @xcite and , hence , inconsistent with the globally densest packing . for example , the densest local packing of congruent two - dimensional circles corresponds to an equilateral triangle , which can tessellate @xmath5 .",
    "this enables one to easily show that the maximally dense packing of circles in @xmath5 is the triangular - lattice packing @xcite . in @xmath4 ,",
    "the densest local packing of congruent spheres corresponds to a regular tetrahedron , which can not completely fill space @xcite .",
    "this was one reason why it took nearly 400 years to prove that one of the maximally dense packings of congruent spheres is achieved by the face - centered - cubic lattice packing ( kepler s conjecture ) and its stacking variants @xcite .",
    "for nonspherical particles in @xmath4 , the situation is even more complex @xcite and any proofs establishing the densest packings of nonspherical particles will be considerably more challenging than for spheres .",
    "for example , in the densest known packing of regular tetrahedra , the centrally symmetric fundamental packing unit is composed of four tetrahedra @xcite , instead of two as in a double - lattice packing in @xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore extremely useful if general organizing principles can be devised to lead one to obtain densest packings of nonspherical particles .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the organizing principles devised for obtaining the maximally dense packings of the platonic and archimedean solids and certain smoothly - shaped convex particles ( e.g. , superballs ) to guide [ 41 , 42 , 45 ] one to find the densest packings of other convex nonspherical particles as well as to concave shapes .",
    "we explicitly state our generalized organizing principles as four distinct propositions , which are applied and tested to the most comprehensive set of both convex and concave particle shapes examined to date , including catalan solids , prisms , antiprisms , cylinders , dimers of spheres and various concave polyhedra .",
    "all of the densest known packings associated with the aforementioned large set of nonspherical particles are consistent with our propositions .",
    "moreover , we show that how they can be applied to construct analytically the densest known packings of certain convex nonspherical particles , including spherocylinders and `` lens - shaped '' particles that are centrally symmetric , as well as square pyramids and rhombic pyramids that lack central symmetry .",
    "although we do not provide rigorous mathematical proofs for our propositions here , we expect that they will either ultimately lead to strict proofs or at least provide crucial guidance in obtaining such proofs for some nonspherical shapes .",
    "moreover , we show how to apply our organizing principles to infer the high - density equilibrium crystalline phases of hard convex and concave particles .",
    "the unique packing attributes of maximally random jammed packings of nonspherical particles are also discussed , which can be used to categorize and characterize mrj packings according to the particle shapes and symmetries .",
