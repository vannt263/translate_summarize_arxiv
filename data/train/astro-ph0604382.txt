    "for a long time , a population of obscured ( type-2 ) radio - quiet quasars has been postulated from modelling the hard ( energies @xmath2 1 kev ) x - ray background as the sum of the emission from extragalactic sources . assumed a population of absorbed active galactic nuclei ( agn : in this paper we use the term to encompass both seyferts and quasars ) , with the same intrinsic spectrum and evolution as unobscured agn , but with a range of obscuring hydrogen column densities , @xmath3 , between @xmath4 and @xmath5 m@xmath6 .",
    "the resulting best - fit ratio for absorbed ( @xmath7 m@xmath6 ) to unabsorbed ( @xmath8 m@xmath6 ) agn was found to be @xmath13:1 .",
    "the model assumed the same distribution of obscuring column densities and redshifts for the low - x - ray luminosity objects ( @xmath9 w ; the seyferts ) and the high - x - ray luminosity objects ( @xmath10 w ; the quasars ) , including a population of highly obscured agn ( the seyfert-2s and type-2 quasars ) .    according to unified schemes ,",
    "type-2 quasars would consist of quasars with the symmetry axes perpendicular to the observer s line of sight , so that the dusty torus around the accretion disk would be viewed edge on , obscuring the optically - bright accretion disk . the gas present in this torus",
    "will obscure the x rays via photoelectric absorption and compton scattering .",
    "this unfavourable orientation means type-2 quasars do not outshine their host galaxy at ( rest - frame ) ultra - violet or optical wavelengths , as is the case with the unobscured ( type-1 ) quasars .",
    "type-2 quasars are therefore indistinguishable from normal galaxies in optical imaging surveys .",
    "if the torus has a half - opening angle of @xmath1 40 , as appears to be the case in radio - loud samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the population of type-2s is expected to be comparable in size to the type-1 population and not to outnumber it by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "a modification to the standard unified scheme is the `` receding torus '' model @xcite in which the more luminous agn sublimate the dust in the inner edge of the torus out to larger distances than the less luminous agn .",
    "this leads to a larger opening angle for more luminous agn , so the fraction of type-1 quasars increases as a function of bolometric luminosity .",
    "such luminosity dependence of the type-2 to type-1 ratio is indeed found , for example , in radio - selected samples by @xcite , in x - ray - selected samples by @xcite , and in spectroscopically selected samples by @xcite .",
    "more recent modelling of the hard x - ray background has consistently shown signs of a large population of obscured agn @xcite and synthesis models have generally required a type-2 to type-1 ratio @xmath11:1 . however , the bulk of the sources required to fit the unresolved x - ray background have moderate redshifts ( @xmath12 ) and x - ray luminosities ( @xmath13w ) characteristic of seyferts rather than quasars .",
    "the latest studies of the hard x - ray background indeed suggest a luminosity - dependent compton - thin - type-2 to type-1 ratio , which decreases to @xmath141:1 at the higher luminosities corresponding to quasars @xcite .",
    "the true type-2 to type-1 ratio will remain unknown until the compton - thick population is unveiled .",
    "deep hard x - ray surveys have now revealed a large population of obscured agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but again most of these sources have moderate x - ray luminosities ( @xmath9w ) and are better described as seyfert-2s rather than type-2 quasars . amongst objects with x - ray luminosities large enough to qualify as quasars , the ratio of type-2 to type-1 objects appears to be only @xmath11:1 , although redshift completeness at faint optical magnitudes ( m@xmath15 , vega ) may still be an issue . despite the great progress with the deep hard x - ray surveys , at high energies ( above 6 - 8 kev ) only @xmath16 of the x - ray background",
    "is accounted for by individual sources , suggesting a substantial population of compton - thick agn which contribute to the hard x - ray background but are missing from current flux - limited x - ray surveys @xcite .",
    "indeed , a good example is the type-2 quasar iras fsc 10214 + 4724 : this object , found in an iras 60 @xmath17 m survey @xcite , has recently been found to be compton - thick @xcite .",
    "an alternative strategy for looking for type-2 objects is to look for the mid - infrared emission .",
    "iras fsc 10214 + 4724 , at @xmath18 , is a classic type-2 object .",
    "however , due to the limited sensitivity of iras , this object was only detected due to a huge gravitational lens magnification ( @xmath1 50 ) of the flux @xcite .",
    "the dramatic increase of mid - infrared sensitivity allowed by the spitzer space telescope @xcite means that similar objects can now be found without the ` benefit ' of gravitational lensing , and mid - infrared selection should be sensitive to the compton - thick quasars missed by x - rays .",
    "following the success of mid - infrared selection in finding type-2 radio - quiet quasars at @xmath19 @xcite , we combined data from the spitzer mips instrument at 24 @xmath17 m @xcite , irac at 3.6 @xmath17 m @xcite and from the very large array ( vla ) at 1.4 ghz @xcite and devised strict selection criteria to hunt for higher redshift type-2s @xcite . the trade - off between our method and x - ray selection , is that our quasars are intrinsically more luminous than agn found in the deep hard x - ray surveys .",
    "the format of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : xray ]",
    "we compare x - ray and mid - infrared selection of obscured quasars . in section [ sec : selcrit ] we explain in detail the selection criteria which we used to find our sample of type-2 quasars .",
    "section [ sec : obs ] deals with the observations while section [ sec : spectra ] describes the optical spectra and section [ sec : photoz ] compares the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts . in section [ sec : composite ] we make the first composite radio - quiet type-2 spectrum .",
    "section [ sec : radio ] is dedicated to comparing our sample to the well studied radio - loud samples .",
    "finally , section [ sec : discussion ] summarises and discusses the implications of this population of type-2 quasars . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a @xmath20cdm cosmology with the following parameters : @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ; @xmath23 .",
    "in the unified scheme for agn , the central engine is surrounded by a torus of dust which will obscure the broad - line region from certain lines - of - sight .",
    "the optical classification for quasars is that type-1s should show broad lines ( and strong optical - uv continuum ) while the type-2s are those objects where the dusty torus is obscuring the broad line region , so only narrow lines are seen .",
    "this classification is concerned with the optical / uv properties , and @xcite found that the dividing extinction for radio - selected ( 3cr and 3crr ) objects corresponded to @xmath24 , with a low fraction of objects with @xmath25 in the range 5 - 15 and a large fraction with @xmath26 .",
    "note also that the @xcite study found that most type-1s ( @xmath27 ) had @xmath28 , with only a small fraction lightly reddened ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "gas and dust are responsible for obscuring the x - rays emitted from the central engine , and the geometrical distribution of the gas is almost certainly different from that of the dust .",
    "it is possible to imagine lines - of - sight which `` graze '' the dusty torus , leading to small amounts of extinction in the optical , but which go through significant additional amounts of gas .",
    "such a line - of - sight would lead to a quasar classified as `` reddened '' ( not type-2 ) in the optical ( @xmath30 ) but as type-2 ( @xmath31m@xmath6 ) in x - rays .",
    "the converse situation , where an optically obscured quasar is barely absorbed in x - rays , is harder to envisage : any line of sight that passes through significant amounts of dust will lead to significant absorption in the x - rays .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that optical type-2 quasars will have negligible x - ray absorption .",
    "however , in edge - on sources , the nuclear soft x - ray emission can plausibly be scattered from an optically thin material located above or below the plane of the torus , leading to an optically - obscured agn with a soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "finally , obscuring material in the host galaxy of the agn can further complicate interpretation .",
    "independently of the orientation of the torus , dust and gas in the host galaxy can cause extinction and absorption with a huge range in @xmath25 and @xmath32 .",
    "x - ray and optical definitions of obscured agn are therefore slightly different and the range of gas - to - dust ratios found by comparing dust - reddening in the optical or near - infrared and x - ray absorption suggests they are not always matched .",
    "we note that we have used a mid - infrared plus radio selection , but since the role of the radio criterion was to avoid non - agn contaminants ( see section  [ sec : selcrit ] ) , in this section we can proceed to consider our technique as basically mid - infrared selection .",
    "the effect of adding the radio flux density cuts is to constrain the type-2 quasars selected to those at the high end of the radio - to - optical correlation for radio - quiet quasars of @xcite , as described in in section [ sec : selcrit ] and in @xcite .",
    "it is of course plausible that radio luminosity correlates in some complicated way with joint mid - infrared , x - ray detectability but we ignore this possibility here .",
    "this section aims to compare the `` merits '' of mid - infrared and x - ray selection by considering a model quasar ( described in section [ sub : modelquasar ] ) with varying amounts of dust extinction ( section [ sub : dust ] ) and different gas - to - dust ratios ( section [ sub : gastodust ] ) .",
    "we also consider the effects of different types of dust ( section [ sub : dusttype ] ) and the orientation dependence of 24-@xmath17 m emission ( section [ sub : orientation ] ) .",
    "we choose this quasar to have @xmath33 since this corresponds to the break in the optical quasar luminosity function at @xmath34 @xcite , the redshift of interest in the analysis in @xcite .",
    "the model quasar is assumed to have an intrinsic unreddened type-1 spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , which we take from @xcite .",
    "this model covers the range between the ( rest - frame ) far - infrared and 4 kev .",
    "we need to complement this with a spectral energy distribution or sed that goes into the hard x - rays , so we assume the @xcite spectrum with the form @xmath35 with @xmath36kev .",
    "this intrinsic unabsorbed type-1 spectrum is chosen as it was used by @xcite for the models we use for absorbed x - ray spectra .",
    "this is practically a flat x - ray sed , and in the range probed by observations at 24 @xmath17 m ( for @xmath37 ) , the sed is also flat ( @xmath38 so @xmath39 ) .",
    "we choose the normalisation to match the @xcite sed at 2 kev .      starting with this type-1 sed , we proceed to model the obscuration of it with dust and gas . in recent times , the type of dust present in type-1 quasars has been described as `` grey '' and alternatively as similar to that of the small magellanic clouds ( smc ) .",
    "grey dust shows a relatively flat extinction law in the optical and uv , while smc - type dust is characterised by a steep increase in the extinction at uv wavelengths . milky way",
    "( mw)-type dust has a uv extinction law which sits in between that of grey and smc . @xcite and @xcite have found the dust in the sdss type-1 sample to be closest to that found in the smc , while @xcite and @xcite argued that extinction curves flatten in the uv ( grey dust ) .",
    "however , @xcite has shown this implication of grey dust to be a selection effect .",
    "the main selection effect arises from measuring dust - reddening from a composite constructed from a flux limited sample : the uv part of the composite is constructed from the higher redshift quasars , which will only make the sample if they are intrinsically brighter and have very little extinction due to dust .",
    "this leads to a negative correlation between @xmath40 and redshift , so that different parts of the composite spectrum are dominated by quasars with different amounts of dust .",
    "the result is a derived dust extinction curve which appears to flatten in the uv ( see willott , 2005 , for more details ) .",
    "we use the extinction curves from @xcite , with the extinction at ( observed ) 24 @xmath17 m given in terms of the extinction at rest - frame visual band , @xmath25 , and a particular dust type .",
    "the quasars in the sdss sample are all type-1s , and the dust discussed in the above paragraph is not necessarily associated with the torus .",
    "the smc has sub - solar metallicity , while the nuclear regions around quasars have solar or super - solar metallicities , with dust properties probably closer to the mw .",
    "the effects of different types of dust are secondary compared to the gas - to - dust ratio , yet important , so we assume mw - dust in figure  [ fig : xraycomp ] and discuss the effect of large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and smc - type dust in section [ sub : dusttype ] and in figure  [ fig : dustcomp ] .",
    "dust extinction is small at rest - frame 24  @xmath17 m , yet the extreme obscuring columns present in the torus and the large redshifts discussed here mean that dust obscuration is not necessarily negligible at observed 24 @xmath17 m . in particular , the 9.7 @xmath17 m silicate absorption feature can have a very important effect on observed 24-@xmath17 m flux density at @xmath41 ( and this feature is significantly deeper for smc - type dust than for mw - type dust , figure  [ fig : dustcomp ] ) .",
    "in contrast to dust extinction , which increases with redshift , x - ray absorption decreases at higher frequencies , meaning x - ray samples benefit from a `` negative k - correction '' .",
    "the x - ray spectra of heavily absorbed quasars can only be modelled correctly via monte - carlo simulations , so we use the models of @xcite .",
    "these assume the intrinsic unabsorbed type-1 spectrum metioned earlier , and assume an fe abundance 5-times solar , which provides a better fit to the hard x - ray backround .",
    "the particular models which we use here ignore the reflection component of x - ray spectra , as it has little effect on our discussion , and have a 2% scattered component .",
    "the obscuring column of hydrogen , responsible for both types of absorption , is given here as a function of @xmath42 by assuming a gas - to - dust ratio .    the milky way is known to have a gast - to - dust ratio such that @xmath43 m@xmath44 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* note this is per magnitude of extinction in v band ) , while the smc has @xmath45 m@xmath46 .",
    "many agn have been found to have higher gas - to - dust ratios than the mw .",
    "we therefore choose two representative values for the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "the mw value is sometimes used as a `` standard '' gas - to - dust ratio . to show the effects of higher gas - to - dust ratios",
    ", we note that , for example , ngc 3281 has a value of @xmath47 m@xmath44 @xcite , while @xcite study one object with @xmath48 m@xmath44 ( ftm1004 + 1229 , assuming a factor @xmath49 , the average between the smc and mw factors , to convert between @xmath40 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath50 m@xmath44 as a realistic higher value to illustrate the effect of different gas - to - dust ratios .",
    "this is not claiming we encompass the whole range in gas - to - dust ratios , but is chosen to illustrate how mid - infrared and x - ray selection are affected by variations in gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "the higher value of gas - to - dust ratio @xmath50 m@xmath44 is high enough for an @xmath51 type-2 quasar to be compton - thick .",
    "figure [ fig : xraycomp ] shows the x - ray flux in the 2 - 10 kev band ( @xmath52 ) versus the 24-@xmath17 m flux density ( @xmath53 ) for type-2 quasars with a range in @xmath25 .",
    "mw - type dust is used to obscure the 24-@xmath17 m emission , and two different gas - to - dust ratios are used .",
    "the top set of curves are for a mw gas - to - dust ratio ( @xmath54 m@xmath46 ) , while the bottom curves are for @xmath50 m@xmath44 . for the higher value of @xmath25 ,",
    "the 9.7 @xmath17 m silicate absorption feature can be seen as a `` meander '' . the caption in figure [ fig : xraycomp ]",
    "details the survey limits used for comparative purposes .    the effect of dust",
    "at observed 24 @xmath17 m is small in the range @xmath55 .",
    "however , it is important to note that at @xmath56 , type-2s will start to drop out of 24-@xmath17 m selection ( for the larger area surveys ) at @xmath41 ( due to the silicate absorption ) and at @xmath57 due to significant dust extinction at the shorter rest - frame wavelengths . for larger values of @xmath25 ,",
    "the width of the silicate absorption line means type-2s in the range @xmath58 drop out of the sample .",
    "as long as the @xmath25 is @xmath59 , the model type-2 quasar would be detectable by the large area 24-@xmath17 m surveys at @xmath60 .    in the @xmath61 deg@xmath62 x - ray asca survey @xcite with flux limit 10@xmath63 w m@xmath6 , the model type-2 quasars with @xmath64 m@xmath6",
    "are hardly affected by the absorption , and would be detected at @xmath65 . for @xmath66 m@xmath6 only @xmath67 type-2s",
    "are detected , and the asca survey would not have the sensitivity to detect compton - thick quasars with @xmath68 m@xmath6 above @xmath69 .",
    "since 24-@xmath17 m selection becomes poor for objects with @xmath70 and x - ray selection fails for objects with @xmath71 m@xmath6 , we can see clearly how the gas - to - dust ratio determines which of the two selections is better . for surveys covering a large area ( @xmath72 deg@xmath62 ) , 24-@xmath17 m selection will be able to pick out type-2s with @xmath73 m@xmath6 as long as they had @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , for agn with gas - to - dust ratios like that of the mw or higher , 24-@xmath17 m selection would fare better than x - ray selection in these surveys .",
    "however , we do not know exactly the selection biases in measuring these gas - to - dust ratios , so the possibility of large numbers of agn with gas - to - dust ratios lower than the mw is not excluded .",
    "for such a gas - to - dust ratio , significantly lower than the mw ( e.g. a tenth of the mw value ) , only quasars with @xmath70 would be classified as type-2s by x - ray observations .",
    "an extreme @xmath75 would be required for the quasars to be compton - thick .",
    "such objects would not be detected by the larger area mid - infrared samples , and therefore x - ray selection would be more sensitive .",
    "this model type-2 would be detected in the goods fields at the whole range of redshifts concerned here , both at 24 @xmath17 m and at 2 - 10 kev ( survey fluxes from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for x - ray and 24-@xmath17 m respectively ) .",
    "so although the compton - thick quasars have not been detected in the asca survey , they are , in theory x - ray detectable in the goods survey .",
    "the reason they have not been found in large numbers is probably an issue of space density , as our model type-2 is rare and large areas are required to find significant numbers of these objects .",
    "goods therefore has the required sensitivity to find hard - x - ray - selected compton - thick type-2 quasars at all redshifts @xmath76 , but they do not cover the area required for this .    since the hard x - ray background is dominated by @xmath12 seyfert-2s , and since seyferts have a higher space density than quasars , a large area is not as crucial .",
    "however , seyfert-2s will have typical fluxes @xmath77 times fainter than our model type-2 quasar , and therefore , at all redshifts seyfert-2s with @xmath73 m@xmath6 will have @xmath78 w m@xmath6 .",
    "this was , of course , already known , as the deep x - ray surveys in goods have not been able to find a population of seyfert-2s large enough to account for the hard x - ray backround .",
    "this has been explained by a bias against the most heavily obscured agn both by x - ray observations and optical spectroscopy @xcite , and our argument is consistent with this .",
    "thus , to find all type-2 quasars ( even the compton thick ones ) , one requires a survey with a 2 - 10 kev flux limit of about @xmath79 w m@xmath6 over a reasonably large area .",
    "therefore , the sxdf survey ( horizontal dotted line : ueda et al . in prep . ) , which covers @xmath11 deg@xmath62 to this depth , should be able to find x - ray - selected compton thick quasars . comparing to the swire depth , we can see that in the region of the sxdf , x - ray selection would be more sensitive than 24-@xmath17 m selection , while still being able to find powerful type-2 quasars .    for compton - thick objects ,",
    "the x - ray selection function is almost flat for @xmath80 .",
    "the redshift - distribution of compton - thick type-2s in a survey deep enough to find them would therefore be dominated by the volume of the survey as a function of redshift and the evolution of the luminosity function .",
    "this means that x - ray surveys deep enough to be sensitive to compton - thick type-2 quasars should find a wealth of @xmath81 objects .",
    "coincidentally , this would be complementary to 24-@xmath17 m surveys , as the mid - infrared surveys would struggle to find heavily obscured type-2s ( @xmath70 ) , especially in the range around @xmath41 .",
    "a second - order effect for mid - infrared selection is the type of dust obscuring the agn , which is particularly important in the range @xmath82 due to the varying depth of the silicate absorption feature .",
    "figure [ fig : dustcomp ] shows the ratio of transmission ( see figure caption ) , at observed 24-@xmath17 m , for mw- and smc - type dust .",
    "it shows clearly that for @xmath60 smc - type dust will cause more absorption in the mid - infrared , in particular around 9.7-@xmath17 m rest - frame ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "thus if the dust obscuring type-2s is more like the dust in the smc than in the mw , then mid - infrared selection might perform slightly worse than expected from figure  [ fig : xraycomp ] .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the dust reddening type-1 quasars has been found to be more similar to smc - dust , but that does not necessarily mean that the dust present in the obscuring torus is also smc - type dust .      the analysis is mainly concerned with 24 @xmath17 m selection of objects at @xmath76 , so we are seeing light reprocessed by dust in the torus at a range of temperatures , @xmath83 k. we now use the results of a radiative transfer code by @xcite to investigate the orientation dependence of observed 24-@xmath17 m emission . in figure",
    "[ fig : l24_lbol ] we quantify the fraction of the bolometric luminosity , @xmath84 , seen at 24-@xmath17 m as a function of redshift . for a pole - on unreddened source ( necessarily a type-1 )",
    ", this fraction is approximately constant between @xmath85 , while for an edge - on source ( a type-2 with @xmath86 ) , the fraction is similar to that of a type-1 and approximately constant in the range @xmath87 . at higher values of @xmath88 , the observed 24-@xmath17 m corresponds to emitted wavelengths ( @xmath89 m ) at which the dust is becoming progresively more opaque . around @xmath41",
    "the silicate feature is seen in emission by the type-1 and absorption by the type-2 , so the observed 24-@xmath17 m emission is not a very good indicator of @xmath84 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that 24-@xmath17 m is a good indicator of bolometric luminosity at @xmath90 and , as shown in figure  [ fig : l24_lbol ] , this result is not strongly dependent on the assumed size of the torus .",
    "to summarise , we have discussed the advantages of mid - infrared selection over hard x - ray selection . for gas - to - dust ratios similar to those found in the milky way ,",
    "x - ray selection is superior , and can probe further down the luminosity function .",
    "however , many agn have gas - to - dust ratios significantly larger than the mw .",
    "we have seen in this section how type-2 quasars with @xmath50 m@xmath44 would naturally drop out of existing large - area x - ray samples without requiring extreme optical obscuration ( @xmath91 would be enough ) .",
    "we have seen that hard x - ray selected samples are in principle able to find even compton - thick type-2s , but they require a combination of depth and area that is only just becoming available . we have also seen that dust - type is important , but mainly in the range @xmath81 ( due to the 9.7-@xmath17 m silicate absorption feature being more pronounced for certain dust types ) . using the results of a radiative transfer code , we have also seen that ( observed ) 24-@xmath17 m luminosity is a constant tracer of type-2 bolometric luminosity in the range @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , 24-@xmath17 m selection is a natural starting place to look for the population of high - redshift type-2 quasars missing from x - ray surveys .",
    "our aim was to find the elusive high redshift type-2 population around the peak in the quasar activity , @xmath93 , and for this we used the following selection criteria :    1 .",

    "@xmath95jy 3 .",
    "@xmath96 mjy      the work described in this paper was all done in the spitzer extragalactic first look survey ( fls ) .",
    "three separate catalogues were cross - matched for the initial selection : the irac 3.6 @xmath17 m @xcite and the mips 24 @xmath17 m @xcite from the spitzer first look survey and the 1.4 ghz catalogue from the nrao vla @xcite .",
    "the flux limits used for 3.6 @xmath17 m , 24 @xmath17 m and 1.4 ghz were 20 , 300 and 100 @xmath17jy respectively .    over the area with coverage in all three bands ( 3.8 deg@xmath62 ) ,",
    "the radio and 24-@xmath17 m catalogues were matched , to select all sources detected at 24-@xmath17 m and within the radio flux cuts .",
    "the chosen sources were then contrasted with the 3.6 @xmath17 m catalogue , to obtain their flux densities in this irac channel .",
    "however , objects were not required to be detected at 3.6 @xmath17 m to be kept in the candidate list .",
    "all matching was done with a 2.5 arcsec tolerance to allow for positional offsets between catalogues .",
    "in addition , in this paper we use tabulate r - band magnitudes from data from the 4-m mayall telescope kitt - peak national observatory @xcite and we also make use of a westerbork synthesis radio telescope deep survey at 1.4 ghz in the spitzer first look survey .",
    "however , these two datasets were not used to select the candidate type-2 quasars .",
    "the mid - infrared criterion @xmath97jy was chosen to select a flux - density - limited sample of active galaxies . at lower redshifts ,",
    "a 24-@xmath17 m selected sample would be dominated by starbursting galaxies , but combined with the 3.6-@xmath17 m selection ( which ensured high - redshift objects , see below ) , this 24-@xmath17 m flux limit should yield powerful agn .",
    "the @xmath98 @xmath17jy criterion is the flux - density limit from a preliminary catalogue , and is actually a 7-@xmath99 limit in the 24-@xmath17 m final catalogue from the spitzer fls data @xcite . at @xmath100 ,",

    "the break in the quasar luminosity function , @xmath105 , has a value of @xmath33 , so our 24-@xmath106 selection will select quasars @xmath107 at @xmath34 , and more luminous quasars at higher redshifts . as explained in section",

    "indeed , the @xmath114 emission is likely to be dominated by starlight for @xmath115 , and since light at 3.6-@xmath17 m is dominated by the old stellar population , there will be an @xmath116 correlation , analogous to the @xmath117 relation for radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "a typical host galaxy for a @xmath34 radio - quiet quasar is the progenitor of a @xmath118 @xcite galaxy in the local universe , so we adapt the @xmath117 relation ( which corresponds to @xmath119 hosts for radio galaxies ) to @xmath120 hosts at 3.6-@xmath17 m . to do this",

    "the stellar mass of the galaxy was set to @xmath122 , and in @xcite we quoted this as corresponding to @xmath120 . if we assume a salpeter imf @xcite and take @xmath123 from the fitting of schechter functions by @xcite , then our assumed stellar mass translates to a @xmath124 galaxy .",

    "an upper limit on @xmath137 was also used to filter out the radio - loud objects , whose extended jets might complicate interpretation .",
    "the radio flux - density cut introduced here will select the radio - bright end of the radio - quiet quasar population @xcite , so these objects can be described as radio - intermediate .",

    "finally , the dashed lines in figure [ grimes ] are not @xmath151 loci , they are the lines that encompass the entire radio - loud population ( i.e. they could be considered @xmath152 contours ) . once these details are taken into consideration , one sees that all the possible systematic errors would only lead to brighter [ o iii ] lines and fainter luminosity at 151 mhz .",
    "only two objects are anywhere near the radio - loud samples : ams03 and ams05 .",
    "the first object has two different ly  @xmath149 lines , and although we have used both for comparative reasons , the weaker of the two lines ( the narrower line of the two ) is unlikely to originate from an agn , the stronger line should be looked at .",
    "the ly  @xmath149 line of ams05 has a large uncertainty in it s flux measurement and is likely to be missing some flux since it was observed at a high airmass .",
    "the sample presented here has typical [ o iii ] luminosity ( in logs ) of 35 - 36 .",

    "it therefore differs from typical radio - selected objects in several respects : once the obscuration of the quasar nucleus is accounted for , they have the high accretion rates of typical quasars , but relatively low radio luminosities .",
    "the radio luminosities of these objects show that these are the radio - bright end of the radio - quiet population , or ` so called ' radio - intermediate quasars .",
    "we have found a set of selection criteria that yields a population of radio - quiet type-2 quasars at @xmath0 .",
    "about half of the objects in this sample show emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "the ratios of these emission lines are similar to those of radio galaxies with the main difference that the c  iv line of type-2 quasars is much stronger and consistent with individual high - redshift type-2 quasars from the literature .",
    "the ly  @xmath149 is often spatially - extended , as are sometimes the high ionisation lines .",
    "this suggests that some of the line emission originates outside the classic narrow - line region , but whether this is due to jet activity or remnants of a merger can not be deduced here . to further compare the type-2s to radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars , we compare their location on the @xmath153}$ ] plane , and find significant differences .",
    "the type-2s have @xmath150}$ ] comparable to radio - loud type-1 quasars , while being fainter at radio wavelengths by a factor of @xmath154 .",
    "in addition , the type-2s presented here show no signs of large extended jets ( except possibly ams04 ) .",
    "finally , comparison between our rough photometric redshift estimation , which assumes @xmath155 host galaxies and our spectroscopic redshifts suggests that the objects in our sample which yield optical spectra are consistent with having host galaxies which are massive ellipticals .",
    "in particular changing our model elliptical from @xmath155 to @xmath156 would bring agreement to the median @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and close to agreement for the mean @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "we have therefore found a population of classic ( radio - intermediate ) type-2 quasars , showing only narrow - lines with , presumably the torus blocking direct view of the quasar along our line - of - sight .",
    "we refer to these objects as ` torus - obscured ' type-2s",
    ".    the lack of objects with spectroscopic redshifts around @xmath41 could plausibly be due to the ly  @xmath149 line being below the atmospheric cut - off , but c  iv is detected in most of the higher-@xmath88 objects ( and he  ii and c  ii ] are sometimes detectable ) so the lack of objects at this redshift may instead be associated with the silicate absorption feature falling on the 24-@xmath17 m band , as discussed in section  [ sec : xray ] .    of the remaining 11 objects , 10 show completely blank spectra and only one shows faint red continuum ( ams20 ) .",
    "their faint 3.6 @xmath17 m flux densities and large r - band magnitudes suggest these are high redshift objects just like the ` torus - obscured ' objects . in our 30-minute integrations , type-1",
    "quasars would have shown extremely bright continuum and lower - redshift ( @xmath159 ) starbursts would have shown [ o  ii ] line emission or at least some strong continuum .",
    "thus our sample does not suffer from any contamination : these blank objects are probably also high - redshift type-2 quasars",
    ".    some of these 11 objects could be at @xmath160 with the c  iv or he  ii lines too faint to be detected , although we have seen that 24-@xmath17 m selection might disfavour this particular range of redshifts .",
    "the remaining objects are presumably obscured by dust on a large scale ( @xmath110pc-1kpc ) , which hides the narrow - line region as well as the broad - line region .",
    "such concentration of dust is characteristic of star - forming regions , so we are presumably seeing either a nuclear or a galaxy - scale starburst . from their blank optical spectra we know that these objects are indeed at high redshift and therefore their mid - infrared flux density is characteristic of objects accreting at a high rate , while their radio flux density is too high to originate only in star - forming regions and must be due to an agn . in two cases ( ams06 and ams19 ) , published",
    "mid - infrared spectra confirm these objects to lie in the correct redshift range . in the other nine cases , despite the lack of lines to pinpoint their exact redshift , we are confident that these blank objects are type-2 quasars at high redshift .",
    "the obscuration , however , is not entirely due to an orientation effect , like for ` torus - obscured ' objects , but due to the host galaxy , and so we refer to these objects as ` host - obscured ' type-2s . at this stage , however , we can not differenciate between dust at scales of @xmath110 pc or @xmath11 kpc .",
    "such objects , lacking agn emission lines in the optical spectra , have been found at lower redshift in the samples of @xcite and .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the ly  @xmath149 ( whether from the narrow - line or star - forming regions ) in the host - obscured type-2s is too obscured for our exposure times ( 30 minutes ) with a 4-m telescope : successful spectroscopy of sub - mm galaxies in the blue requires very long integrations ( 1.5 - 6 hours ) with 8-m or 10-m class telescopes .",
    "we do note that ams03 shows spatially - extended ly  @xmath149 , no other lines and no continuum , so there is a chance this object is host - obscured and the second ly  @xmath149 line traces the starburst : this requires further study .",
    "in @xcite , the type-2 to type-1 ratio at @xmath161 was modelled by predicting the number of type-1 quasars which would follow the 24-@xmath17 m and radio criteria .",
    "the 3.6-@xmath17 m criterion was simply assumed as a way of rejecting type-1s as well as providing a rough photometric redshift . the number of @xmath162 type-1 quasars meeting the 24-@xmath17 m was predicted from the b - band luminosity function of , converting from b - band to 24-@xmath17 m using the @xcite sed",
    ". the optical - to - radio correlation of @xcite was then used to predict what fraction of the 24-@xmath17 m detected type-1s would also meet the radio criterion .",
    "this modelling predicted 4.3@xmath163 such type-1 quasars , at @xmath162 and in our 3.8 deg@xmath62 field .",
    "there are 5 narrow - line objects in our sample with spectroscopically confirmed @xmath162 , and the quasar type-2 to type-1 ratio for narrow - line ( torus - obscured ) type-2s and type-1 quasars is therefore @xmath11:1 . for the blank objects ,",
    "the crude photometric redshifts can be used to estimate , on average , how many blank ( host - obscured ) objects are at @xmath109 .",
    "there are 6 such objects , and so in @xcite the ratio of total number of type-2s ( host- and torus - obscured ) to type-1s was estimated to be 11/4 or @xmath13:1 . since then ams06 has been shown spectroscopically to lie at @xmath164 the current number of objects at @xmath162 is 10 . from the errors in the modelled number of type-1 quasars , and the poisson errors in our sample , the ratio of type-2 to type-1 quasars is found to be 2.3@xmath165 . in a future paper",
    "we will calculate better photometric redshifts , to try and obtain a more reliable estimate of the quasar fraction at @xmath166 .",
    "the ` two types of type-2 ' quasar , and a type-1 quasar are schematically represented in figure [ sketch ] . for a quasar to be of type-1 it has to lie in a relatively dust free galaxy ( a ` transparent ' galaxy ) as well as having a favourable orientation to the torus ( case a in figure [ sketch ] ) .",
    "a quasar in a transparent galaxy , with an unfavourable angle to the torus will not outshine its host galaxy , but the narrow - line region will still be visible ( case b : a torus - obscured type-2 ) .",
    "when the host galaxy is dusty enough to obscure the quasar ( cases c and d ) it is no longer possible to see the central region , whether we have a favourable angle to the torus ( c ) or not ( d ) .",
    "objects of case c and d are likely to yield blank spectra , and are indistinguishable from each other with the current dataset .",
    "observations at radio frequencies , however , could shed some light on the orientation if radio jets are present .",
    "this simple picture is likely to be applicable only to radio - quiet objects , since the powerful radio jets are likely to be capable of removing dust on large scales @xcite .",
    "therefore , although the ratio of type-2 to type-1 is likely to be @xmath12 - 3:1 for radio - quiet samples",
    "( and for all non - radio - selected samples , since radio - quiet objects will dominate ) , it should be closer to 1:1 for radio - loud samples .",
    "thus radio - loud samples will have few ` host - obscured ' quasars and the quasar fraction measured in these radio - loud samples will be dominated by the geometry of the torus .",
    "this picture is therefore consistent with the ratio of narrow - line to broad - line quasars predicted by unified models and found for radio - loud objects .    inferring a type-2 to type-1 ratio @xmath12 - 3:1 for the sample presented in this article does not disagree with the receding - torus models , since the obscuring mechanism for ` host - obscured ' type-2s is unrelated to the torus orientation or geometry .",
    "the ratio of torus - obscured ( b ) to type-1 ( a ) quasars predicted for our sample is @xmath11:1 ( and indeed consistent with the receding - torus : figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "this phenomenon of host - obscuration might also be present in the seyfert-2s at @xmath167 that dominate the hard x - ray background , in which case care must be taken to separate the obscuring mechanism necessary to explain the agn dominating the x - ray background from modifications to the unified schemes such as the receding torus .",
    "the ratio of @xmath12 - 3:1 found for this sample is similar to the ratio required for seyfert-2s to seyfert-1s at @xmath167 to fit the hard x - ray background , although a ratio @xmath12 - 3:1 for the quasars is not required by the hard x - ray background @xcite .",
    "we do note , that due to the range in gas - to - dust ratios , some of the x - ray obscured quasars that contribute to the hard x - ray background are not necessarily type-2s in the optical sense ( they might only be reddened quasars with @xmath168 but a large gas - to - dust ratio ) .",
    "however , at least in our sample , we find the ratio of all type-2s ( b , c and d ) to type-1 ( a ) is @xmath12 - 3:1 : a higher type-2 to type-1 ratio than is found in deep x - ray surveys .",
    "this suggests that indeed , 24-@xmath17 m selection can find type-2 quasars that x - ray selection in the 2 - 10 kev band has not been able to detect , and therefore a number of the type-2 quasars presented here should be compton - thick .",
    "this , of course , can be tested via x - ray follow - up of this or a similar sample .",
