    "the idea of using a copy of the plant nonlinearity in the controller is used previously in the literature @xcite . however in this paper , we apply a new methodology to construct a controller which uses linear state feedback guaranteed cost control and copies of the plant nonlinearities to form a dynamic state feedback robust nonlinear controller .",
