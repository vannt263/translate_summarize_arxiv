    "we recommend the the review papers @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of symmetry broken phases ( such as the superconducting state ) the simple scaling procedure usually fails due to a natural lower boundary cut - off ( the energy gap @xmath39 of the single particle excitations ) .",
    "it has been even claimed that conventional rg techniques are blind with respect to the symmetry - broken states @xcite .",

    "perhaps the second option is more natural because after all the interactions are always mediated by certain boson fields ( phonons , photons , gravitons , etc ) .",
    "unfortunately in practice it is hard to go beyond a simple saddle point approximation except than by taking into account the small gaussian corrections around it . in the next section",
    "we shall briefly describe a more convenient procedure which has been proposed in 1994 .",
    "an alternative approach to deal with the many - body effects ( which in particular is suitable for studying the symmetry broken phases ) has been invented by wegner @xcite and independently by wilson and gazek @xcite . instead of integrating out the high energy states ( fast modes )",
    "one constructs a continuous unitary transformation @xmath46 with a purpose to simplify the hamiltonian either to diagonal or at least to a block - diagonal form .",
    "this is achieved through a series of infinitesimal steps @xmath47 , where @xmath48 stands for some formal continuous parameter .",

    "this method has a similarity to the traditional rg scaling procedure because    * diagonalization of the high energy sector occurs mainly during initial part * while the low energy states are worked out at the very end of transformation .    roughly speaking , a role of the wilson s cut - off energy @xmath38",
    "is played here by @xmath51 .",
    "advantage of such new procedure becomes particularly clear when investigating the mutual relations between the high and small energy states ( i.e.  between the _ fast _ and _ small _ modes ) . in the continuous canonical transformation one treats both energy sectors on equal footing throughout the whole transformation process .",
    "thereof their feedback effects are feasible to study .    for",

    "some a survey we recommend the recent review papers @xcite .",
    "as far as the diagonalization is concerned the continuous canonical transformation turns out to be a rather convenient tool .",
    "however , if one needs the correlation functions then the situation becomes more cumbersome .",
    "for example , to determine the correlation functions @xmath57 one needs the statistical average @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "the easiest way to carry out the statistical averaging ( [ averaging ] ) is in the limit @xmath60 when @xmath61 becomes ( block-)diagonal .",
    "however , this requires a simultaneous transformation of the observables @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding flow equation is given in a familiar form @xmath63 .",
    "\\label{o_flow}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , calculation of the correlation functions is rather more relative to the projection techniques .",
    "to illustrate how the flow equation method actually works we first consider the bilinear hamiltonian @xmath64 which can be solved exactly , in particular by a single step bogoliubov transformation @xcite .",
    "the off - diagonal terms in the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) can be thought as resulting from the mean field approximation for the weak pairing potential @xmath65 with a usual definition of the order parameter @xmath66 .    to get the rigorous solution we now construct a continuous transformation such that the convoluted states @xmath67 and @xmath68 will be decoupled .",
    "this continuous process depends on a distance from the fermi surface @xmath69 ( and the same holds for computation of the coherence factors @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) .    using the wegner s proposal ( [ eta ] )",
    "we obtain the two coupled flow equations @xmath72 for @xmath48-dependent quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 . the second equation ( [ delta_flow ] )",

    "= 6.5 cm    collective features seen in the pair - pair correlations ( or in the density - density correlations ) tell us directly about a presence or absence of the long range order which is necessary for the onset superconductivity / superfluidity . as a matter of fact the single particle properties",

    "our work indeed confirms that existence of the preformed ( i.e.   incoherent ) fermion pairs is a natural expectation while approaching @xmath1 from above .",
    "such type of situation can be encountered in the high @xmath115 cuprate superconductors where the strong quantum fluctuations are driven by the unscreened coulomb repulsion between electrons and by the reduced dimensionality of cuo@xmath0 planes @xcite .",
    "pseudogap have been also unambiguously observed in the ultracold fermion atoms close to the unitarity limit ( i.e.  on the feshbach resonance ) @xcite .",

    "this non - perturbative technique overcomes usual problems of the standard rg methods in application to the symmetry broken states .",
    "we have illustrated it on the exactly solvable case of the bilinear hamiltonian .",
    "this new method is moreover capable to study the possible feedback effects between the _ fast _ and _ slow _ modes treating both sectors simultaneously throughout the whole continuous transformation .    applying this method to the strongly interacting fermion system we have shown that formation of the fermion pairs need",
    "not be accompanied by the transition to superfluid / superconducting state .",
    "strong quantum fluctuations can suppress the long - range coherence ( ordering ) so that effectively the fermion pairs exist even in the normal state above @xmath1 .",
