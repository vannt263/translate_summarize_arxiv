    "theoretical investigation of hadron production in heavy - ion collisions at high energies is usually separated into different camps , characterized by the regions of transverse momenta @xmath0 of the produced hadrons . at low @xmath0 statistical hadronization and hydrodynamical models",
    "are generally used @xcite . at high @xmath0",
    "jet production and parton fragmentation with suitable consideration of medium effects in perturbative qcd are the central themes @xcite .",
    "the two approaches have been studied essentially independent of each other with credible success in interpreting the experimental data . at the intermediate and lower @xmath0 region , recombination or",
    "coalescence ( reco ) model has been found to be more reasonable in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the three reco models have some differences in details , but they are physically very similar . refs .",
    "@xcite gave the wigner functions of produced hadrons with the phase - space distributions of the constituents at the freeze out .",
    "the recombination and fragmentation are treated as independent components of the hadronization .",
    "the reco models are also used to study light nuclei production in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "this review will follow the formulation of the recombination model ( rm ) by hwa - yang @xcite .",
    "this model is one dimensional on the basis that non - collinear partons have very low probability of coalescence , and is simple enough to include fragmentation as a component of recombination of shower partons so that there is a smooth transition from low to high @xmath0 .",
    "the aim of this review is to give an overview how to treat the hadornization for the whole @xmath0 region for au - au collisions at rhic and pb - pb collisions at lhc with hwa - yang recombination model . in pb - pb collisions ,",
    "there are much more soft partons and hard jets produced .",
    "therefore , the hadronization at lhc is drastically different from that at rhic . in the recombination model , there are two types of partons : thermal ( t ) and shower ( s ) .",
    "the minijets generate shower partons after emerging from the medium surface .",
    "those shower partons recombine with themselves or with the thermal partons in various combination to form hadron .",
    "therefore , the effect of minijets on hadron production ca nt be ignored . beside the @xmath0 distribution , the azimuthal anisotropy",
    "have been studied by considering the ridges by semihard scattering in ref .",
    "quark number scaling of @xmath3 was also found to be only approximately valid at low @xmath0 , but was broken at intermediate @xmath0 . with more careful consideration of momentum degradation on semihard parton , we will review the effect of minijets on azimuthal dependence in non - central au - au collisions .",
    "conventional description of azimuthal anisotropy does nt consider the effects of jets . in this review the details of calculations",
    "will be not shown , and adequate referencing is provided to guide the interested reader to the original papers where details can be found .",
    "first , we show a brief summary of the main equations of the recombination model , which are collected in refs . @xcite .",
    "the invariant @xmath0 distributions of meson and baryon at midrapidity are @xmath4 f_{q_1q_2q_3}(p_1,p_2,p_3 ) { r}_{q_1q_2q_3}^b(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_t )     \\label{22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the transverse momentum of one of the coalescing partons . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the recombination functions of meson and baryon , respectively @xcite , which were introduced a long time ago and determined by the effects of dressing and hadronic structure @xcite .",
    "the lhs of eqs .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) are the invariant @xmath0 distributions of meson and baryon , respectively , averaged over @xmath8 at midrapidity .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence has been averaged over , so @xmath9 should be identified with the experimental @xmath10 .",
    "the central issue in the formalism is the determination of the parton distributions @xmath11 and @xmath12 just before hadronization . @xmath13 and @xmath14 to denote the thermal and shower partons invariant distributions at the late time just before hadronization , respectively .",
    "the thermal parton contains the medium effect , while the shower parton is due to the semihard and hard scattered partons .",
    "the shower partons we consider are the fragmentation products of the hard and semihard partons that emerge from the surface after momentum degradation .",
    "they are distinguished from the thermal partons that are in their environment .",
    "taking into account the recombination of different types of partons , we have @xmath15 the two shower partons in @xmath16 and @xmath17 are probably from one or two jets . the three shower partons in @xmath18",
    "could be even from three different jets . here",
    "we will not consider three jets contribution to the hadron production .",
    "the thermal parton distribution is @xmath19 where @xmath20 has the dimension of inverse momentum and @xmath21 is the inverse slope parameter that should not be treated as the same as the conventional temperature in hydrodynamical model .",
    "they could be fixed by the experimental data at low @xmath0 .",
    "the dimensionless prefactor @xmath22 is necessary to yield pure exponential behavior for the hadron distribution @xmath23 .",
    "on the other hand , the properties of shower parton distribution depend on the collisions energy , not only due to many more hard and semihard partons produced but also the quenching effect of hot dense medium .",
    "the shower parton distribution after integration over jet momentum @xmath24 and summed over all jets is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the distribution of hard or semihard parton of type @xmath27 at the medium surface after momentum degradation while transversing the medium but before fragmentation .",
    "it also depends on the centrality and medium property , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "@xmath26 was introduced previously for collisions at rhic for any centrality @xcite , but also modified to suit the description of the physics at lhc @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 is defined as the average of @xmath29 over @xmath1 @xmath30 the average parton distribution @xmath29 will be discussed in sec .",
    "@xmath31 is the shower - parton distribution ( spd ) in a jet of type @xmath27 fragmentation into a parton of type @xmath32 with momentum fraction @xmath33 .",
    "spd is determined by the fragmentation function ( ff ) on the basis that hadrons in a jet are formed by recombination of the shower partons in the jet @xcite .",
    "in particular , the recombination of a quark @xmath32 with an antiquark @xmath34 in a jet of type @xmath27 forms a pion , for which the ff is @xmath35 .",
    "the numerical form for @xmath31 can therefore be calculated from the data on @xmath36 and the rf of pion : @xmath37 where the curly brackets denote symmetrization of the leading parton momentum fractions @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite gave the parametrization of @xmath40 for all partons .",
    "once the spds are known , one can consider the possibility that a shower parton recombines with a thermal parton and thus give a more complete description of hadronization at intermediate @xmath0 region .    only considering the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) component for pion ( proton ) ,",
    "we have been able to fit the pion and proton spectra for @xmath43 gev / c in au - au collisions at 200 gev with a common value of the inverse slope in eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) @xcite . for @xmath44 gev / c",
    "there is resonance contribution which could nt be calculated in rm , while for @xmath45 gev / c shower parton contributions invalidate the approximation of @xmath46 and @xmath47 by @xmath48 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "as we shall see below , the situation of dominance by @xmath49 and @xmath50 recombination changes when the collision energy is increased tenfold , whereby @xmath51 and @xmath52 can no longer be neglected even for the low @xmath0 region at lhc .",
    "but before discussing the spd , we need to have a clear picture for the process of momentum degradation of a semihard parton when transferring the hot dense medium .",
    "refs . @xcite gave a detailed explanation of the momentum degradation on a semihard or hard parton for any centrality and at any angle @xmath1 .",
    "here we show a brief summary on it .",
    "the average parton distribution @xmath53 for the momentum @xmath54 at the medium surface is defined as , @xmath55 which averages over all @xmath56 with the weighting function @xmath57 being the probability of having @xmath56 at @xmath1 and @xmath58 .",
    "the dynamical length @xmath56 carries all the information on geometry and dynamics through @xmath57 .",
    "this probability @xmath57 has been described in refs .",

    "in this review , we have presented the production of the identified hadrons in au - au collisions at rhic and in pb - pb collisions at lhc in a formalism that displays all the components of thermal- and shower - parton recombination .",
    "it established that any theoretical treatment of hadrons produced at low and intermediate @xmath0 region would be incomplete without taking the effects of minijets into account .",
    "minijets are important and can explain all the low transverse momentum data in the recombination framework .    for au - au collisions at 200 gev , we have shown that the hadron spectra and azimuthal harmonics can be obtained by taking into account the azimuthal dependence of minijet .",
    "but for pb - pb collisions at 2.76 tev we have only investigated the case of central collisions .",
