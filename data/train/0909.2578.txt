    "the einstein field equations are local equations in the sense that they only describe the local geometry of the spacetime . for example",
    "the robertson - walker metric explicitly contains the parameter @xmath0 which gives an account of the intrinsic spatial curvature . using the friedmann equations this parameter",
    "can be determined experimentally since it is directly related to the density parameter @xmath1 and the hubble parameter @xmath2 .",
    "recent measurements of the energy density of the universe tend to slightly favor a positively curved universe @xcite , yet a flat curvature lies within the 1-@xmath3 range .",
    "the most direct conclusion is that the spatial topology of the universe is just @xmath4 which is the assumption of the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "nevertheless in the mathematical literature it is well known that a flat space does not mean that its topology is necessarily @xmath4 , in fact there are 18 possible flat topologies .",
    "since the einstein field equations are not sensitive to topology every possibility has to be considered as a possible candidate for the global geometry of our universe until it is ruled out by experiment . in order to do",
    "so we first note that the spectrum of the laplace operator sensitively depends on the topology , i.e. it is discrete if the eigenstates are normalizable and continuous if not . in the first case the solution for e.g. a torus is given by plane waves with a wave vector @xmath6 taking only discrete values @xmath7 while in the second case the ( weak ) solution to the eigenvalue equation is given by the ( distributional ) plane waves with a continuous wave vector @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the eigenvalue problem for @xmath9 on @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 , and on @xmath12 by @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the implication of a solution of the form @xmath17 is the existence of a wave function @xmath18 with a maximum length corresponding to e.g. the length of the edges of the torus . since the departure from a continuous solution is biggest for large wavelengths we have to look for large - scale structures of the universe in order to distinguish between cosmic topologies .",
    "the best way to do so is to measure the inhomogeneities of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , expand these in multipole moments and compare the low multipoles with the predictions from theory .",
    "it can be shown that in certain closed topologies a suppression in the power spectrum of the low multipoles is expected because of the existence of a largest wavelength . since such",
    "a suppression is present in the cmb several studies compared the theoretical predictions for various topologies with the data . while most analyzed topologies can already be ruled out three of them describe the data even better than the infinite @xmath5cdm model , namely the torus @xcite , the dodecahedron@xcite and the binary octahedron@xcite ( see also references therein ) . while the last two topologies are spherical the torus is the simplest model of a closed flat topology .",
    "however , we know that standard cosmology can not be the final answer as its predictability breaks down at the big bang .",
    "a quantization of the friedmann equations a la wheeler - dewitt does not improve this behavior either .",
    "this situation has changed thanks to a new model called loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) developed over the last few years which removes the initial singularity .",
    "lqc @xcite is the approach motivated by loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite to the quantization of symmetric cosmological models .",
    "the usual procedure is to reduce the classical phase space of the full theory to a phase space with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the quantization of these reduced models uses the tools of the lqg and is therefore called lqc but it does not correspond to the cosmological sector of lqg .",
    "the results of lqc not only provide new insights into the quantum structure of spacetime near the big - band singularity but also remove this singularity by extending the time evolution to negative times .    in sum , on the one hand we have hints from observation that our universe may have a closed topology , on the other hand we have a very successful loop quantization of various cosmologies .",
    "thus , starting from these two motivations , we would like to study lqc with a torus topology .",
    "but contrary to the works on the cmb we do nt want to restrict the analysis to a cubical torus .",
    "to do so we construct a torus using thurston s theorem and find that the most general torus has six degrees of freedom which consist of e.g. three lengths and three angles .",
    "we will study its dynamics by numerically solving the hamiltonian coupled to a scalar field .",
    "after rewritting this hamiltonian in terms of ashtekar variables we will see that the quantization of such a torus leads to a product between the standard hilbert spaces of lqc and the hilbert spaces over the circle .",
    "moreover , we will find two ways to quantize the components of the triad and show that both ( generalized ) eigenfunctions are not normalizable in this hilbert space .    as a side remark we would like to point out that the consequences of putting a non - abelian gauge theory into a box with periodic boundary conditions have been studied in e.g. @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind this idea is an attempt to explain the quark confinement in qcd without explicitely breaking gauge invariance . to simplify the analysis the @xmath19-valued gauge field",
    "is chosen to be pure gauge , i.e. @xmath20 with @xmath21 , such that the holonomy around a closed curve @xmath22 only depends on the topological property of @xmath22 .",
    "since general relativity written in terms of ashtekar variables is also a ( constrained ) yang - mills theory it may be tentalizing to use the methods developed for qcd in a box to lqc of a torus universe .",
    "however we will derive an ashtekar connection for the homogeneous torus which is not pure gauge so that the holonomies along @xmath22 also depend on the length of @xmath22 .",
    "this may not be surprising in view of the fact that the hilbert space of lqc on @xmath4 is spanned by almost periodic functions with an arbitrary length parameter @xmath23 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in we first introduce the classical dynamics of a torus universe and numerically solve the friedmann equations with a massless scalar field . in",
    "we introduce the ashtekar variables for a torus and also explain the complications that arise because of a closed topology .",
    "the loop quantization and the construction of a hilbert space are explained in and provides a summary and directions for future works .",
    "[ sec : fundamentaldomain ] gives a short review of the fundamental domain of the 3-torus and [ sec : torusiwasawa ] describes the dynamics of the torus in terms of iwasawa coordinates .",
    "the purpose of this section is to study models in which the spatial section has a compact topology .",
    "the compactness of a locally homogeneous space brings new degrees of freedom of deformations , known as teichmller deformations .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that cosmology on a torus is simply cosmology on @xmath4 restricted to a cube may be too naive a point of view , especially since the space of solutions of a torus gets nine additional degrees of freedom , as already mentioned in @xcite .",
    "we will introduce teichmller spaces with an emphasis on a thurston geometry admitting a bianchi i geometry as its subgeometry @xcite and derive the vacuum friedmann equations using the hamiltonian formalism .",

    ", we can also start from a three - dimensional , simply connected riemannian manifold @xmath30 which admits a compact quotient @xmath24 . in order to construct this compact manifold",
    "consider the covering group @xmath35 which is isomorphic to the fundamental group @xmath36 of @xmath24 .",
    "this implies that @xmath37 which is hausdorff iff @xmath38 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath33 and a riemannian manifold iff @xmath38 acts freely on @xmath30 .",

    "we will need the following important theorem :    any maximal , simply connected 3-dimensional geometry which admits a compact quotient is equivalent to the geometry @xmath41 where @xmath30 is one of @xmath43 ( euclidean ) , @xmath44 ( hyperbolic ) , @xmath45 ( 3-sphere ) , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , nil or sol .",

    "the reason is that the action of the covering group @xmath38 needs to preserve both the extrinsic curvature and the spatial metric of @xmath30 .",
    "thus we can not construct a homogeneous compact manifold by the action of a discrete subgroup of @xmath33 on the spatial three - section @xmath30 .",
    "instead we need the isometry group of the four - dimensional manifold @xmath69 .",

    "an extendible isometry is defined by the restriction of an isometry of @xmath76 on @xmath30 which preserves @xmath30 and forms a subgroup @xmath77 of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , in order to get a compact homogeneous manifold from @xmath69 the covering group @xmath38 must be a subgroup of esom@xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 the line element of @xmath70 is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the invariant one - forms .",
    "therefore the teichmller parameters enlarge the parameter space by bringing new degrees of freedom from the deformations defined in definition  [ def : teichmueller ] .",

    "let us define the symmetric operator @xmath545 a calculation shows that @xmath546 is given by @xmath547 this operator is rather complicated and no analytic solutions to the eigenvalue problem could be found .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the quantization of @xmath548 as described in where the commutator between @xmath433 and @xmath549 vanishes .",

    "a gauge transformation of an @xmath563-connection is given by aa=^-1a+^-1dwhere @xmath564 .",
    "infinitesimally we can write this equation as a_a^ia^i_a = a_a^i+_a^i+^i_jk^ja_a^k+(^2).the classical gauss constraint ensuring @xmath165-invariance is given by g()=-_^3d^3xe^a_jd_a^jwhere @xmath565 is the covariant derivative of the smearing field @xmath264",

    "this hilbert space is a true subspace of @xmath568 since zero is in the discrete part of the spectrum of the gauss constraint operator .",
    "we saw in that thanks to the symmetry reduction two of the gauss constraints are automatically satisfied .",
    "while the nonvanishing gauss constraint is still a complicated function in @xmath252 and @xmath254 it simplifies to after the canonical transformation .",

    "in this paper we studied how a torus universe affects the results of lqc . to do",

    "we studied the dynamics of a torus universe driven by a homogeneous scalar field by numerically solving the full hamiltonian and saw that its form only remains cubic if all off - diagonal terms vanish .",
    "the ashtekar connection and the densitized triad for a torus were then derived for both the most general and a slighty simplified torus .",
    "the reason for this simplification was that a simple solution to the gauss constraint could be given .",
    "we also derived the hamiltonian constraint in these new variables and showed that it reduces to the standard constraint of isotropic lqc in case of a cubical torus .",
    "the passage to the quantum theory required a canonical transformation so as to be able to write the holonomies as a product of strictly and almost periodic functions .",
    "a cauchy completion then led to a hilbert space given by square integrable functions over both @xmath579 and @xmath578 .",
    "however the drawback of the canonical transformation is a much more complicated expression for the components of the densitized triad containing both the momentum and the configuration variables . following the standard procedure of lqc we substituted these configuration variables with the sine thereof and were able to solve the eigenvalue problem analytically .",
    "surprisingly it turned out that the ( generalized ) eigenfunctions of the triad operators do not lie in the hilbert space , i.e. the spectrum is continuous . on the other hand",
    "we were also able to find almost periodic solutions to the eigenvalue problem of the triad operators without performing the substitution just described , but once again these eigenfunctions do not lie in the hilbert space .",
    "the reason why both ways lead to a continuous spectrum is the non - cubical form of the torus , for if we set the angles @xmath580 in the triads correspond to the ones obtained in isotropic models .",
    "furthermore we were able to find the spectrum of the volume operator for the second case because , contrary to the first case , it is a product of commutating triad operators .",
    "although we gave a couple of numerical solutions to the classical hamiltonian we did nt consider its quantization .",
    "the constraint describing quantum dynamics of a torus is given by inserting the holonomies into thiemann s expression for the quantum hamiltonian @xcite c_^ijk(h_i^(^0_i)h_j^(^0_j)(h_i^(^0_i))^-1(h_j^(^0_j))^-1h_k^(^0_k)[(h_k^(^0_k))^-1,v ] ) .",
    "contrary to lqg and lqc we saw that the spectrum of the volume operator of a torus is continuous .",
    "it would thus be very interesting to know how far @xmath581 departs from the usual difference operator of lqc .",
    "furthermore , whether a quantization of the torus a la lqg removes the big band singularity needs also to be addressed , especially since we saw that many characteristics of both lqg and isotropic lqc are not present in this particular topology .    in this work we only considered the simplest closed flat topology but",
    "there are many other closed topologies . as we saw there are eight geometries admitting at least one compact quotient .",
    "for example there are six different compact quotients with covering @xmath582 , namely @xmath10 , @xmath583 , @xmath584 , @xmath585 , @xmath586 and a space where all generators are screw motions with rotation angle @xmath587",
    ". it would be interesting to know how these discrete groups @xmath588 affect the results of this work , especially since the last five spaces are inhomogeneous ( observer dependent ) @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank martin bojowald , frank steiner and jan eric strng for many useful comments and corrections of previous versions of this manuscript .",
    "in two dimensions the upper half - plane @xmath589 is the set of complex numbers @xmath590 .",
    "when endowed with the poincar metric @xmath591 this half - plane is called the poincar upper half - plane and is a two - dimensional hyperbolic geometry .",
    "the special linear group @xmath592 acts on @xmath589 by linear fractional transformations @xmath593 , @xmath594 , and is an isometry group of @xmath589 since it leaves the poincar metric invariant .",
    "the modular group @xmath595 defines a fundamental domain by means of the quotient space @xmath596 .",
    "this fundamental domain parametrizes inequivalent families of 2-tori and can thus be identified as the configuration space of the two - dimensional torus .",
    "since we consider a three - dimensional torus with six independent teichmller parameters ( see ) we need a generalization of the poincar upper half - plane @xcite to a six - dimensional upper half - space .",
    "a fundamental domain @xmath597 for @xmath114 is a subset of the space @xmath598 which is described by the quotient space @xmath599 . in other words , if both @xmath600 and @xmath601:=g^tag$ ] , @xmath602 , are in the fundamental domain then either @xmath221 and @xmath601 $ ] are on the boundary of the fundamental domain or @xmath603 .",
    "since @xmath604 is a subspace of the six - dimensional euclidean space ( there are six independent matrix elements for @xmath600 ) , the generalization of the poincar upper half - plane is now a six - dimensional upper half - space @xmath605 upon which the group @xmath606 acts transitively . to identify @xmath604 with an upper half - space we introduce",
    "the iwasawa coordinates such that @xmath607 there is the unique decomposition : @xmath608 with @xmath609 with @xmath610 .",
    "the geometry of the upper half - space @xmath611 is given by the @xmath612-invariant line element @xmath613 note that the ricci scalar of the metric is constant and negative .    in order to give a parametrization of the fundamental region we use minkowski s reduction theory @xcite , which tells us that for a metric @xmath614 the following inequalities must be satisfied : @xmath615 since the metric is invariant under the map",
    "@xmath616 we can define the upper half - space as @xmath617 , where we have identified the element @xmath618 with @xmath150 . in our parametrization",
    "we therefore obtain the fundamental domain @xmath597 delimited by the inequalities : @xmath619    the first inequality tells us that the length of the generators of the torus are ordered : @xmath620 .",
    "however , starting with such an ordered triplet does not necessarily imply that the order is preserved by dynamics .",
    "thus we think that it may be more appropriate to choose the equivalent representation of the configuration space given by @xmath621 .",
    "otherwise , we would have to rotate the coordinate system every time the torus leaves the fundamental domain .",
    "note that similar results have also been obtained in m - theory , where one considers a compactification of the extra dimensions on @xmath622 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the situation is different in string theory where one really integrates only over the fundamental domain , e.g. @xmath623 .",
    "in this appendix we use a parametrization of the torus using the iwasawa coordinates which are more apt to describe the asymptotic behavior of the metric @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the role of the off - diagonal terms in the metric and to know what happens near the singularity and at late times .",
    "the metric can be decomposed as follows : @xmath624 where @xmath625 an easy calculation shows that can be transformed into with @xmath626 , @xmath627 , @xmath628 , @xmath629 ( no summation ) are strictly positive",
    ". however the nondiagonal scale factors can be negative or zero . ] . the analogue to is now given by @xmath630 the iwasawa decomposition",
    "can also be viewed as the gram - schmidt orthogonalization of the forms @xmath92 : @xmath631 where the coframes @xmath632 are given by @xmath633 analogously , the frames @xmath634 dual to the coframes @xmath632 are given by the inverse of @xmath635 : @xmath636 since the determinant of the matrix @xmath637 is equal to one the basis given by the coframe is orthonormal .",
    "note that this is different from the construction in .    in order to determine the asymptotic behavior of the off - diagonal terms we follow the analysis in @xcite .",
    "the metric @xmath2 being symmetric , we automatically know that its eigenvalues are real .",
    "we call these eigenvalues @xmath638 , @xmath639 and @xmath640 , in analogy to the diagonal kasner solution ( see ) and construct a metric @xmath641 by means of a constant matrix @xmath642 @xmath643 with these relations we can obtain the evolution of the iwasawa variables .",
    "for example , we have @xmath644 in @xcite it was shown that the asymptotic behavior @xmath645 of the off - diagonal terms of the iwasawa variables is given by @xmath646 which means that the off - diagonal terms freeze in as we approach the singularity .",
    "we can also calculate the other limit @xmath647 and obtain e.g. @xmath648 we have checked this result numerically , which can be seen in where the gray line @xmath649 converges for @xmath647 toward the solid line ( @xmath650 , i.e. @xmath651 . however , the limit @xmath652 could not be checked due to the numerical instability of the solutions when approaching the singularity .",
