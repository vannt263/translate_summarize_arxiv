    "it is a great honor to be asked to contribute to the special issue honoring the 75th birthday of professor rodney baxter and it may be proper to finally give a review of the early history of how the integrable chiral potts model came into being .",
    "first of all , baxter has given many important contributions to this topic , as is also evidenced by his contribution in this special issue @xcite .",
    "secondly , the early development of the theory went through many unexpected twists and turns and missed opportunities not reported in the published papers ; reporting on these should encourage others seeking to discover new solvable models and further properties of existing ones .",
    "it really started in the summer of 1986 , when barry mccoy , mulin yan , helen au - yang and i decided to start a project on parafermions .",
    "the work of zamolodchikov and fateev @xcite seemed to us to relate parafermionic conformal quantum field theory to the phase transition separating regimes i and ii in the rsos model of andrews , baxter and forrester @xcite , especially , since huse @xcite had already suggested that this transition is in the universality class of the chiral clock model @xcite .",
    "we split the project into two parts : au - yang and yan were to look at a preprint of alcaraz and lima santos , now published as @xcite , while mccoy and i would try to find painlev - type equations that could be used to describe parafermionic correlations , extending the conformal theory into the massive regime , and also try a variety of perturbation expansions of correlation functions to use for that purpose .",
    "au - yang soon discovered that the full 3-state self - dual case solves the quantum lax pair equations , as formulated by bashilov and pokrovsky @xcite : there are no conditions on the corresponding spin - chain hamiltonian for a family of transfer matrices commuting with it to exist , even if the boltzmann weights in @xcite are allowed to be chiral !",
    "chiral comes from the greek word @xmath1 , hand , so that it means handed , not reflection invariant .",
    "the four of us looked briefly at au - yang s solution and found that the spectral variables lie on an elliptic curve , but that the only physical two - dimensional classical spin model was the three - state critical potts model .",
    "mccoy and i decided for the moment to continue with painlev and series expansions .",
    "au - yang and yan went on to analyze the non - self - dual 3-state chiral potts model with boltzmann weights @xmath2 and @xmath3 for horizontal and vertical nearest - neighbor pair interactions of spins @xmath4 and @xmath5 with values 1 to 3 ( or 0 to 2 ) mod 3 , writing @xmath6 as used in the quantum lax pair approach .",
    "a logical thing to do seemed to rewrite the star - triangle equations @xcite in these variables , assuming three versions of the weights for the three different positions in these equations , namely @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , or @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "as @xmath13 involves a discrete fourier transform , such a transform was also applied to the star - triangle equations , which then became , ( with proper normalizations of all @xmath7 s and @xmath8 s , which we can choose to be @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and in the star - triangle equation into @xmath17 . ]",
    "@xmath18 eliminating @xmath19 and @xmath20 from ( [ st ] ) , one gets the consistency equations @xmath21 note that no difference - variable assumption is made on rapidities ( spectral variables ) . in the self - dual case @xmath22 , @xmath23 , one can restrict oneself to @xmath24 ; then for @xmath25 there is only one equation left and choosing @xmath26 and @xmath27 arbitrarily , the equation then determines a relation between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , parametrizing a commuting family of transfer matrices .    more generally , assuming the existence of a one - parameter family of solutions leading to a commuting family of diagonal - to - diagonal transfer matrices @xmath30 , we should by baxter s well - known argument @xcite take the derivative of the logarithm of @xmath30 at a shift point @xmath31 , where @xmath32 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , so that @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it was easy to check that this leads to a spin - chain hamiltonian @xmath36 of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xcite @xmath39 satisfying @xmath40 and @xmath41 an irrelevant constant that equals 0 with the above normalization @xmath34 .",
    "for the non - self - dual @xmath25 case there is one condition @xmath42 this was first derived from the quantum lax pair approach and then rederived using ( [ condition ] ) and substituting ( [ hamlimit ] ) and a similar equation with @xmath43 replaced by @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    expanding only @xmath9 and @xmath47 at the shift point @xmath48 one",
    "has two equivalent sets of @xmath49 equations determining the commutation of a transfer matrix with a hamiltonian : @xmath50 with @xmath51 the fourier duals of the @xmath52 and @xmath13 . without conditions on the @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 neither ( [ eql ] ) nor ( [ eqs ] ) allow a one - parameter family of transfer matrices , unless @xmath55 or @xmath25 selfdual . now",
    "( [ eql ] ) is linear and homogeneous in the alphas , so that the coefficient determinant should vanish . for @xmath25",
    "this was one way to derive ( [ alpharel ] ) .",
    "au - yang then proceeded to eliminate @xmath56 and @xmath57 from both systems ( [ eql ] ) and ( [ eqs ] ) for the case @xmath25 by the euclidean algorithm , assuming the consistency relation ( [ alpharel ] ) .",
    "in the meantime mccoy and i were still wrestling with our half of the project , trying to find some nonlinear painlev - type equation trying to generalize the conformal field theory equations of zamolodchikov and fateev @xcite to the massive regime .",
    "we expanded some correlations of the abf model and tried to fit them to quadratic or cubic relations .",
    "we also tried several extensions of the sato  miwa ",
    "jimbo approach .",
    "we did not get very far in spite of massive computations .",
    "part of what we found was written up at the end of 1986 @xcite , but the major spin - off would come two years later .",
    "everything changed early october 1986 , when au - yang came to us with the curve , @xmath58 none of us could recognize this curve and mccoy showed it to sah and kuga in the stony brook mathematics department .",
    "several days later they told us that the genus of the curve ( [ genus10 ] ) was 10 .",
    "this violated the folklore that solutions of the quantum yang ",
    "baxter equations are parametrized by curves of genus at most 1 !",
    "a period of extensive checking by all four of us followed and we studied the conditions on the alphas for @xmath59 , concluding that when @xmath0 is not prime the solution is not unique .",
    "we found that the double fourier transforms of ( [ eql ] ) and ( [ eqs ] ) , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , are easier to deal with for larger @xmath0 .",
    "one can even subtract from ( [ eql2 ] ) the same equation with @xmath62 .",
    "expanding the @xmath13 and @xmath52 , one finds equations with only @xmath53 and @xmath54 . once we got a result for @xmath63 , au - yang and i guessed a general solution @xmath64 and verified that it satisfies all equations for all @xmath65 .",
    "mccoy and i also did an extensive literature search and found among others a paper by von gehlen and rittenberg @xcite , who had found the special case of ( [ alphas ] ) with @xmath66 , causing us to present ( [ alphas ] ) in the above form .",
    "we were surprised not to have found out earlier that @xcite is cited in @xcite .    at some point",
    "early 1987 mccoy also got his student shuang tang involved in the checking before the paper was submitted , as he wanted to be absolutely sure about the conclusion before the submission of the letter @xcite .",
    "tang would be very involved in the next stage of the project . as the principal author of the work",
    ", au - yang was supposed to speak about it at the rutgers meeting may 7 - 8 , but she wanted me to do it @xcite .",
    "there were two back - to - back talks scheduled , one by mcguire , ` there are no higher - genus solutions of the star triangle relations ' and mine ` commuting transfer matrices in the chiral potts models and solutions of star - triangle equations with genus larger than one . ' before the talks mcguire and i compared notes and found no contradiction , as he had assumed that the weights depend only on rapidity differences , forcing the genus of the rapidity manifold to be 0 or 1 .",
    "he changed his title and his talk became a good introduction to my talk @xcite .    at summer research institute theta functions ",
    "bowdoin , july 1987 , i reported our results in more detail , adding several other observations that i had made , such as the equivalence of the quantum lax pair and star - triangle equation approaches and that the dolan  grady criterion @xcite implies the existence of an onsager algebra , and i submitted a handwritten manuscript for publication .",
    "the proceedings came out only two years later @xcite , so that i had to include an update , modifying the last sentence and adding two further paragraphs , as a lot had happened since .      at theta functions",
    "bowdoin , barry mccoy reported on our next nearly finished work @xcite . we had noted that in ( [ condition ] ) , ( [ eql ] ) , ( [ eqs ] ) and ( [ eql2 ] ) we have @xmath49 equations in the general case , ( i.e.  4 for @xmath25 , 9 for @xmath59 ) , but only @xmath67 equations in the self - dual case , ( or 1 for @xmath25 , 3 for @xmath59 , 6 for @xmath63 ) . therefore , we decided first to extract the curve for the integrable manifold of the @xmath59 self - dual case using the euclidean algorithm both by hand and by computer using wolfram s smp . tang , mccoy and i thus obtained a curve for the 4-state self - dual case and han sah recognized it as a fermat curve , mapping it to @xmath68 in homogeneous coordinates @xcite .",
    "next we applied the same method to the 5-state self - dual case using smp , obtaining some curves that took several computer screens to display .",
    "but we managed to extract their rather simple common factor and using a map patterned after the @xmath59 case , we found a parametrization of the boltzmann weights in terms of the curve @xmath69 .",
    "it did then not take much imagination to conjecture the answer for general @xmath0 in terms of the fermat curve @xmath70 .",
    "more precisely , we wrote the product form @xmath71 with the fermat curve given as @xmath72 involving a rescaling of the homogeneous coordinates @xmath73 .",
    "generically , the genus of the curve ( [ fermat ] ) is @xmath67 . for @xmath74 , ( [ selfdual ] )",
    "reduces to the genus - zero solution of fateev and zamolodchikov ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 11 ) ) .",
    "the new self - dual result was submitted in october 1987 as part of our contribution to the sato festschrift @xcite .",
    "it was clear that we did not have the computer power to do the next step , the @xmath59 non - self - dual case , the same way .",
    "nevertheless , progress came soon after , during five weeks following a one week conference in canberra in november 1987 , when rodney baxter , helen au - yang and i got together to work out the general case .       and @xmath75 .",
    "the handedness is indicated by arrows between the spins of values @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "also given are the oriented lines on which rapidities @xmath76 and @xmath77 live .",
    "row two gives the equivalent checkerboard vertex model representation.,width=384 ]    the first thing to be decided was a proper notation for the boltzmann weights .",
    "we clearly needed to incorporate baxter s",
    "@xmath78-invariance @xcite , but we decided to use notations from @xcite , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "in analogy with relativistic scattering theory we decided to call the spectral variables @xmath79 rapidities and to put arrows on the rapidity lines . the chirality of the interactions between spins , @xmath80 is indicated by arrows .",
    "the potts nature means that the weights depend on differences @xmath81 mod @xmath0 . not to give the same figures every time , i have here also given the equivalent checkerboard vertex model representation , representing the star - triangle equations as in figure [ fig2 ] .        for several days the three of us made attempts to generalize the conjectured product form ( [ fermat ] ) for the self - dual case . at some point",
    "i proposed to look at the ising model and to write the theta functions of the differences of @xmath76 and @xmath77 as sums of products of functions of @xmath76 and @xmath77 separately .",
    "we could use either onsager s paper @xcite or our two papers @xcite .",
    "baxter and au - yang thought that i was crazy to guess a product from a single factor and i was to finish the calculation i was doing .",
    "the next day we went for an outing in tidbinbilla , but the morning after baxter came up with the desired product forms @xcite , @xmath82 periodicity mod @xmath0 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , led to the chiral potts curve condition for the rapidities @xmath85 , @xmath86 using a suitable normalization .",
    "we did extensive checking using fortran on the new little macintosh computers at australian national university and the scalar factor @xmath87 in the star - triangle equation was guessed also from ising and checked by fortran .",
    "our letter @xcite contains many more results , and we obtained a proof that the star - triangle equations are satisfied using recurrences based on variations of ( [ st ] ) .",
    "this proof was published a few years later in the appendix of @xcite .      during these six weeks in canberra",
    ", i made a brief visit to melbourne which was also very significant , because paul pearce gave me a copy of a preprint by bazhanov and reshetikhin .",
    "this preprint contained a cubic functional relation , that was omitted in the published version @xcite .",
    "as the onsager algebra @xcite and the paper of von gehlen and rittenberg @xcite indicated that the chiral potts model is a cyclic version of quantum sl(2 ) , we conjectured that chiral potts would have a similar functional relation .",
    "barry mccoy thus made his students tang and albertini solve the eigenvalue problem for small systems so that soon numerical support for our conjecture would be available .    in the meantime , baxter obtained the first free - energy result by the  399th \" method @xcite to solve the ising model and he found the specific heat exponent to be @xmath88 for the two - dimensional classical case @xcite .    the small chain results for the von gehlen  rittenberg special case were particularly simple and mccoy coined the term ` superintegrable ' for this case with extra onsager - algebra integrability , as several concepts were being ` supered ' by our high - energy colleagues in stony brook . therefore , as i had some traveling to do , i wrote a couple of self - submitting batch jobs in smp on the three ridge unix computers of the institute for theoretical physics that gave us iteratively the ground state energy of the superintegrable chain in the commensurate phase for chains of considerable length , leading to long series expansions for @xmath25 , 4 , 5 and general @xmath0 . at some higher orders i had to work around multiplication errors in the smp program .",
    "also our earlier labor doing series expansions trying to get painlev - type results paid off : one day mccoy told us to look again at the paper by howes , kadanoff and den nijs @xcite , as they had conjectured a particularly simple result for the order parameter of the 3-state superintegrable quantum chain in the ordered ground state , namely @xmath89 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 3.13 ) ) .",
    "they stated that they had done a series expansion that reproduced this conjecture to thirteenth order !",
    "soon we obtained the leading terms in the expansion of the order parameters for general @xmath0 , so that we could generalize their conjecture as @xmath90 invoking baxter s @xmath78-invariance @xcite , this result should apply also to the ordered phase of the full integrable chiral potts model , both for the one - dimensional quantum chain and the two - dimensional classical case .",
    "however , this was based on only very few terms .",
    "luckily , just walking by , i noted a preprint of henkel and lacki @xcite on the very top of a pile of discarded preprints in one of the garbage bins of the itp .",
    "this gave further confirmation , as henkel and lacki had expanded the sum of the order parameters to one more order than we had done .",
    "unfortunately for them , for @xmath91 this sum does not have the binomial form that it has for @xmath55 and 3 .",
    "our conjecture was submitted may 1988 in a paper with several other results @xcite .",
    "early october 1988 we received a preprint of baxter @xcite in which he solved several properties of the superintegrable case by the inversion relation . about a week later we submitted our paper @xcite with our cubic functional equation that had been verified by albertini for several chain lengths using fortran . as a result",
    ", we found that there had to exist a commensurate - incommensurate phase transition in the superintegrable 3-state chain @xcite for @xmath92 , so that the conjectured phase diagram in @xcite with a lifshitz point at @xmath93 is not quite correct .    at the taniguchi conference ,",
    "october 1988 , miwa made me present a detailed proof that the weights ( [ weights ] ) satisfy the star - triangle equation .",
    "each time i had filled his high - tech whiteboard he printed a copy of what i had written .",
    "a more elaborate paper appears in the proceedings @xcite , with the proof given in the appendix .",
    "mccoy presented details @xcite about the appearance of the incommensurate phase in the 3-state superintegrable quantum chain .",
    "multi - particle excitations were also studied to estimate size of the incommensurate phase @xcite .",
    "there were many further developments , especially the representation theory explanation of bazhanov and stroganov , valid for odd @xmath0 @xcite , and an alternative approach valid for all @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the difference of these two approaches is discussed in the next section .",
    "these two works made the relation with cyclic representations of quantum groups as described later by de concini and kac @xcite explicit , confirming our earlier thoughts on it .",
    "there should be some models that have rapidities on higher - genus curves other than the one of chiral potts .",
    "martins @xcite claims to have found a model parametrized by a k3 surface recently and it would be interesting to investigate this further .    to conclude this section , we should mention some early works of krichever and korepanov , of which we were not aware until some time in 1993 when we received some copies in russian in the mail . in @xcite krichever proved his theorem 1 stating that generically the genus of the curve coming from vacuum vectors of an @xmath0-state model related to the six - vertex model had to be @xmath49 , but he only worked out the case @xmath55 in detail .",
    "korepanov followed this up studying the cases @xmath25 and greater @xcite , discovering thus the boltzmann weight of some @xmath94 model , in agreement with krichever s theorem and with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 13 ) ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 10 ) ) . this way , though unknown outside the soviet union for many years",
    ", korepanov gave the first explicit demonstration of a solution of the quantum yang ",
    "baxter equation with a higher - genus parametrization , several months before the discovery of the integrable chiral potts model .",
    "however , korepanov did not discover the integrable chiral potts model , nor did he construct the @xmath87-matrix intertwining two cyclic representations . that construction had to wait until @xcite . only with the complete construction",
    "does one know that both the horizontal and vertical transfer matrices of the @xmath94 model form commuting families with one set of spectral parameters ( rapidities ) taken from the high - genus curve and the other set from the genus - zero curve of the six - vertex model . until @xcite the meaning of korepanov s discovery was veiled .",
    "finally , in the introduction of our recent paper @xcite one can find some other references related to parafermions that are of historical interest , including papers on generalized clifford algebras .",
    "when @xmath55 , the integrable chiral potts model becomes the ising model .",
    "the chiral potts spin - chain hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) reduces to @xmath95 identifying @xmath96 and @xmath97 as pauli matrices , and @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "this is the transverse - field ising chain hamiltonian , now so popular in quantum information circles .",
    "as said before , the connection with the ising model for @xmath55 has been very important for us to find the high - genus solutions of the star - triangle equations @xcite .    in the ising case of spin-@xmath100 ,",
    "the spin operators have mixed commutation relations : commuting if at different sites , but anticommuting at the same site .",
    "this was first addressed in the ising model context by bruria kaufman @xcite , who introduced the clifford algebra spinors , @xmath101 a generalization to spin-@xmath100 xxz models at roots of unity was introduced by deguchi , fabricius and mccoy @xcite .",
    "nishino and deguchi @xcite found a further generalization applicable to the superintegrable @xmath94-model when @xmath0 is odd , as required in @xcite .",
    "this was followed by a series of papers on the superintegrable @xmath94 and chiral potts models @xcite for general @xmath0 using @xcite . in these papers",
    "we constructed the eigenvectors in the ground state sector and the order parameters using a generalized jordan  wigner transform .    in these superintegrable models",
    "there is additional sl(2 ) loop group symmetry , supporting representations of the onsager algebra @xcite , @xmath102=4g_{j - k},\\qquad[g_m , a_l]=2a_{l+m}-2a_{l - m } , \\qquad[g_j , g_k]=0,\\ ] ] but with a more complicated closure relation than in the ising model .",
    "it should be noted that von gehlen and rittenberg @xcite had already constructed the superintegrable chiral potts quantum chain in 1985 , using the dolan  grady criterion @xcite , @xmath103]=16[a_0,a_1 ] , \\nonumber\\\\ & [ a_1,[a_1,[a_1,a_0]]]=16[a_1,a_0].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a kind of serre relation implying the existence of the onsager algebra .      a quantum group construction of the integrable chiral potts model has first been given by bazhanov and stroganov @xcite for odd @xmath0 , starting from an r - matrix of the six - vertex model , the intertwiner of two highest - weight spin-@xmath104 representations .",
    "they constructed next the intertwiner of a spin-@xmath104 and a cyclic representation ( @xmath94-model weights ) .",
    "finally , the square of four chiral potts weights as given in @xcite and figure  [ fig3 ] was shown to intertwine two cyclic representations .    the more general the six - vertex r - matrix",
    "is chosen , the more easy it is to arrive at the chiral potts model .",
    "korepanov @xcite had chosen @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "bazhanov and stroganov @xcite made a special gauge choice with @xmath108 , whereas @xcite also ended up with @xmath109 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 1.7 ) ) for the comparison .      in order to get a construction valid for all @xmath0 , baxter , bazhanov and perk @xcite started in the opposite direction with a star of chiral potts model weights as in figure  [ fig4 ] , with boltzmann weights defined by ( [ weights ] ) and",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "summing out the central spin gives an interaction - round - a - face ( irf ) model weight @xmath110 , which can also be viewed as a vertex model weight using the well - known map assigning spin differences mod @xmath0 to the line pieces .",
    ", as that setup differs by a fourier duality transform from the one in figure  [ fig4 ] . ]",
    "if one now chooses @xmath111 , then @xmath112 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , so that @xmath115 is triangular and the leading block is the r - matrix of a @xmath94 model .",
    "if one also chooses @xmath116 , then also @xmath112 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and we receive a six - vertex r - matrix .",
    "we consider from now on the superintegrable case @xmath119 .",
    "then , dropping some overall factors we can write the @xmath120 r - matrix as @xmath121 and the @xmath122 @xmath94 r - matrix as @xmath123 here @xmath124 and @xmath125 are genus-0 rapidities of the six - vertex model , @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the @xmath128 matrices defined before .",
    "we can string @xmath133 @xmath94-model r - matrices together to form a monodromy matrix . writing @xmath134 following notations of the faddeev school @xcite . then two such monodromy matrices @xmath135 and @xmath136 satisfy a yang  baxter equation with the six - vertex r - matrix .",
    "this is so , both for the finite - dimensional case with @xmath137 and the infinite - dimensional case with generic @xmath77 that we shall introduce later .",
    "the monodromy matrix @xmath135 is a polynomial in @xmath124 of degree @xmath133 .",
    "so , we write @xmath138 in each of these four series all coefficients commute .",
    "it is easy to work out some of these coefficients explicitly @xcite @xmath139 we note that some of these look like coproducts .",
