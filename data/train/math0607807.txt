    "throughout this paper we work over an algebraically closed field @xmath0 of characteristic zero , and genus always means geometric genus .",
    "the study of severi varieties is one of the classical problems in algebraic geometry .",
    "given a smooth projective surface @xmath1 , a line bundle @xmath2 , and an integer @xmath3 , one defines severi variety @xmath4 to be the closure of the locus of nodal curves of genus @xmath3 .",
    "then the subvariety @xmath5 parameterizing irreducible curves is of special interest .",
    "originally , these varieties were introduced by severi ( in the plane case ) in order to prove the irreducibility of the moduli spaces of curves @xmath6 in characteristic zero . in anhang f of his famous book , _ vorlesungen ber algebraische geometrie _ , f. severi gave a false proof of the irreducibility of @xmath7 .",
    "and it took more than sixty years , till , in 1986 , harris proved this result @xcite .",
    "the study of various properties of severi varieties , in particular their degrees continued , and several formulas were obtained : recursive formulas of caporaso and harris for projective plane , and of vakil for hirzebruch surfaces , and a non - recursive formula of mikhalkin for toric surfaces .",
    "more formulas were obtained by kontsevich , ran , ruan , tian and others . although the degrees of severi varieties have been computed for any projective toric surface ,",
    "the irreducibility problem is still open in most of the cases .",
    "the goal of the current paper is to give a proof of the irreducibility of @xmath5 on hirzebruch surfaces .",
    "we shall mention that shevchishin announced the same result , but up to our knowledge his argument is incomplete .",
    "we shall also mention that the approach presented in this paper is different from that of shevchishin @xcite .",
    "the idea of the proof of the irreducibility of severi varieties on hirzebruch surfaces is as follows .",
    "let @xmath8 be a hirzebruch surface , and let @xmath9 be a line bundle , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the effective classes generating @xmath12 , satisfying @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath16 for the severi variety @xmath17 . in these notations the first part of the proof is given by proposition [ contain ] , which states the following : any irreducible component @xmath18 contains a very reducible nodal curve of a special type .",
    "now , the irreducibility of @xmath19 follows from proposition [ unique ] , claiming that there exists a unique component containing such a curve , whose generic point corresponds to an irreducible curve .",
    "the proof of proposition [ contain ] is similar to the plane case proof of harris presented in @xcite .",
    "the proof of proposition [ unique ] is reduced to a combinatorial statement using monodromy - type arguments .",
    "to finish the introduction we shall mention that there are examples of ( non - rational ) surfaces admitting reducible severi varieties .",
    "moreover , these severi varieties can have components of different dimensions .",
    "so it is unclear how to characterize the surfaces admitting only irreducible severi varieties .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to state the following conjecture motivated by our result and mikhalkin s work @xcite :    [ conj0 ] if @xmath1 is a toric surface , @xmath20 is an effective class , and @xmath21 is a non - negative integer then the severi variety @xmath22 parameterizing irreducible nodal curves of genus @xmath3 in @xmath23 , that do not contain singular points of @xmath1 , is either empty or irreducible .    we shall discuss the proof of this conjecture for rational curves in the last section of the paper , and we hope that the general case can be approached using the rapidly developing methods of tropical geometry combined with the approach presented in the current paper .    finally , we would like to mention that the case of positive characteristic is still open even for plane curves .",
    "it seems that the main missing ingredient is a statement characterizing severi varieties in terms of their dimensions ( similar to theorem [ th : dimbd ] ) .",
    "there is a tropical evident that such a statement must exist , however we do not know any algebraic theorem of this type .",
    "nevertheless we suppose that conjecture [ conj0 ] is true in arbitrary characteristic .",
    "i am very grateful to j. bernstein , g .-",
    "greuel , e. shustin , and m. temkin for helpful discussions .",
    "parts of this work were done while the author was a clore postdoctoral fellow at the weizmann institute of science , a moore instructor at mit , and was visiting the max - planck - institut fr mathematik at bonn .",
    "i would like to thank these institutions for their hospitality .",
    "in this section we discuss several ( basic ) facts from the deformation theory of algebraic varieties and algebraic maps .",
    "most of the statements , ideas , and proofs presented here can be found in different sources ( see for example @xcite , and @xcite for related topics ) .",
    "however , i decided to write it down here for the completeness of the presentation .",

    "then @xmath52 is isomorphic to the trivial extension , namely @xmath53 .    due to the claim we can fix trivializations @xmath54",
