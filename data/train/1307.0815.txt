    "optical tweezers ( ot ) have become a key tool in the fields of biological and statistical physics @xcite . ot use focused laser beams to form optical traps around dielectric objects . over the past years several important achievements in the field of single - molecule biophysics",
    "have been obtained using optical tweezers in the dual trap ( dt ) setup , which manipulate single molecules tethered between two optically trapped dielectric beads ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] a ) .",
    "dt setups have two important advantages . on the one hand",
    "the possibility of manipulating single molecules by all - optical means guarantees an exceptional isolation from ambient noise . on the other hand , in many experimental situations",
    ", the measurement of cross correlations between signals coming from two traps allows to overcome the resolution limit imposed by the stiffness of the traps @xcite .",
    "most dt setups use single beam trapping . in this case a dielectric bead is trapped near to the focus of a convergent laser beam by balancing the scattering and gradient forces , exerted along the optical axis .",
    "several experiments have been performed with this setup , e.g. the direct measurement of hydrodynamic correlations between trapped particles @xcite , of the stiffness of long double - stranded dna molecules @xcite and of the sequence - dependent free energy landscape of dna hairpins and proteins @xcite . in most cases",
    "the force applied by the trap on the sample is measured by modeling the trap as an harmonic spring .",
    "the force applied by the trap , @xmath0 , is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the stiffness of the equivalent spring and @xmath3 is the position of the trapped bead with respect to the center of the trap .",
    "the stiffness of such spring can be measured in several ways by applying a known force to the trapped bead and measuring its displacement from the center of the trap .",
    "unfortunately the stiffness , and thus the calibration of force measurement , depends on the details of the experimental setup , such as the size or shape of the trapped bead , the index of refraction of bead and surrounding medium and laser power .",
    "moreover the harmonic model of the trap can be largely inaccurate and nonlinear effects can appear even at moderate forces , leading to large errors in force calibration .",
    "an exception to this rule is given by setups which measure forces based on the conservation of linear momentum @xcite .",
    "in these cases there is no need for trap modeling and calibration is more robust .",
    "direct force measurement methods have already been implemented in single ",
    "trap ( st ) optical tweezers setups and used in single molecule experiments @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report the performance of a novel dt setup based on single beam trapping which exploits the advantages of direct force measurements together with those of all - optical manipulation . the outline of this setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] a , while in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] b we show a video microscopy image of two optically trapped beads .",
    "this setup has been implemented in a miniaturized version of st setup that uses counter - propagating beams @xcite ( fig . [ fig:1 ] c ) .",
    "single beam trapping requires large numerical aperture ( na ) beams , to enhance the gradient force . on the contrary",
    ", direct force measurement requires low na beams .",
    "a strategy to implement direct force measurements in single beam traps is to increase the angular acceptance of the collector objective , which requires a specific optical design and great care in performing experiments .",
    "this approach has been pursued in @xcite .",
    "our approach is different .",
    "the trapping efficiency is known to strongly depend both on the na of the beam and on the effective refraction index , i.e. , the ratio of the refraction index of the trapped bead to that of the surrounding medium .",
    "the effect of this latter variable has not been tested in @xcite .",
    "we use underfilling ( low na @xmath4 ) beams in high na ( @xmath5 ) objectives .",
    "using underfilling beams the trap performance at effective refractive index 1.2 ( polystyrene in water ) is too poor to perform experiments .",
    "however by using beads with lower effective refraction index ( @xmath6 ) it is possible to perform single molecule experiments .",
    "such conditions can be achieved with silica beads in water or polystyrene beads in sucrose solution . even in these conditions",
    "the trap stiffness per watt is low ( @xmath7 pn/(nm w ) ) compared to other setups , but sufficient to perform single - molecule experiments on small hairpins .",
    "contrary to other dual - trap setups , which use polarization optics to distinguish the light from the two beams we employ a counter - propagating geometry .",
    "in this geometry the two beams forming the traps leave the sample region in opposite directions ( horizontal black arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] a ) so that the light coming from each trap can be separately detected and the force exerted by each trap measured . in this way we avoid systematic errors coming from cross talk @xcite and depolarization , but incur in reflection effects as detailed in section [ fff ] .",
    "this setup works at low laser power ( 50 mw in the sample region ) , which limits trap stiffness but leads to several experimental advantages such as reduced heating in the sample region , reduced tether photodamage @xcite and negligible optical binding effects between the two trapped beads @xcite .",
    "in addition , with our dt setup it is possible to perform single molecule experiments on very short tethers ( as short as 20 nm ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this has not been reported in co - propagating setups .     * dt vs st setup . *",
    "a ) the experimental dt setup described in this paper , based on the minitweezers @xcite .",
    "two optical traps are created with two objectives ( obj 1 , obj 2 ) from counter - propagating laser beams .",
    "the force exerted by the traps is measured by two position sensitive devices ( psd 1 , psd 2 ) with sub - piconewton resolution by direct measurement of light momentum , while the position of both traps is monitored with nanometer accuracy .",
    "the horizontal black arrows show the direction of light propagation .",
    "two force signals , @xmath8 are measured ( vertical black arrows ) .",
    "b ) two optically trapped beads and the micropipette used in the st setup in a video - microscopy image . the beads are @xmath9 4 @xmath10 m in diameter .",
    "c ) the st setup introduced in @xcite is used to create a single  trap and to manipulate a molecule tethered between two beads .",

    "d ) experimental issues in the st setup . left panel : drift effects due to uncontrolled movements of the micro  pipette .",
    "right panel : the bead in the pipette is not free to rotate and the molecule can be misaligned with respect to the pulling direction .",
    "these effects are largely reduced in the dt setup .",
    "e ) the great stability of the two - trap setup allows drift free long  term measurements .",
    "here we show a ten - minute passive mode hopping trace for a dna hairpin as in section [ mfor ] ( red points : raw data acquired at 1 khz , black points box average to 10hz ) , in which the relative position of the traps drifts less than 2 nm.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the dt setup has some advantages over the st setup , mainly because the latter employs a micropipette which drifts during experiments ( fig .",
    "drift is greatly reduced in the dt setup , although it lacks the compensation of drift between the two traps so characteristic of co - propagating setups . in fig [ fig:1 ] e a force trace from a hopping experiment ( see section [ mfor ] ) of almost 10 minutes of duration is shown .",
    "moreover the st setup only measures the position of the trap , assuming the bead in the pipette is fixed ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] c ) , while the dt setup can measure the position of both traps , their relative distance being the control parameter in the experiments ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] a ) .",
    "the main limits of the design described in this article are the limited trap stiffness due to the strict requirements for direct force measurement and the misalignment of the traps along the optical axis .",
    "as far as misalignment is concerned , we show that , although it can have a large effect on high - bandwidth elastic fluctuation measurements @xcite , it can be generally disregarded when working at lower bandwidth as in hopping or pulling experiments .",
    "the optical tweezers instrument shown in figure [ figure : opts ] is based on that designed by smith et al .",
    "@xcite and described in @xcite .",
    "two optical traps are created from two different 845 nm , single mode , fiber coupled laser diodes ( lumix lu0845m200 ) .",
    "the laser power is 130 mw , while the power of the laser actually reaching the trap is 50 mw in all the experiments .",
    "these sources emit linearly polarized beams in the @xmath11 mode .",
    "part of the light intensity emitted from a source ( laser a ) is used to actually create the trap while a small fraction (  5% ) is redirected by a beam splitter pellicle and condensed to a position sensitive device ( psd ) `` light lever '' ( fig.[figure : opts ] ) in order to monitor trap displacements .",
    "piezoelectric crystals are used to gently push the tip of the optical fiber coupled to the laser source , allowing to redirect the laser beam and move the optical trap in the optical plane ( i.e. perpendicular to the optical axis ) .",
    "the light used to create the trap is set to circular polarization .",
    "this is obtained using a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) , which selects the horizontally polarized light , and a @xmath12 plate .",
    "the beam is then focused to form the trap by a water immersion objective ( olympus uplsapo 60@xmath13w ) .",
    "the light leaving the trap is then recollected by a second objective , symmetrically positioned with respect to the first one , converted to vertical linear polarization through a second @xmath12 plate and redirected by a pbs to a psd which measures the momentum flux carried by the light coming out of the trap .",
    "the light from the second source ( laser diode b ) undergoes a mirror symmetric path .",
    "the two beams share their optical path between the objectives . in order to correctly measure forces by linear momentum conservation",
    "it is necessary to recollect all the light exiting from the trap , which can be achieved by using underfilling beams in large numerical aperture objectives , so that the only light loss is due to reflection by mirrors and beads which is below 2% in the range of forces explored by this instrument ( see below ) .",
    "the counter - propagating geometry ensures that the light forming the traps leave the sample region in opposite directions .",
    "the light coming from each trap can be separately detected and the force exerted by each trap measured .",
    "a blue led and a ccd camera ( watec wat-902h3 supreme eia ) are used to monitor the experiment by video microscopy : a lens projects the image of the focal plane to the ccd camera which responds both in the visible and in the infrared so that an image of both the beams and the trapped beads can be distinguished .",

    "all the light leaving from the trap is collected by a second objective and sent to a position sensitive detector which integrates the light momentum flux , measuring changes in light momentum @xcite .",
    "the laser beams share part of their optical paths and are separated by polarization .",
    "part of the laser light ( @xmath9 5% ) is deviated by a pellicle before focusing and used to monitor the trap position ( light lever ) .",
    "the trap is moved by pushing the tip of the fiber tip by piezo actuators ( wiggler).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "force measurement is obtained by collecting all the light deflected from the trapped bead @xcite .",
    "the instrument measures forces acting in the optical plane ( @xmath14 plane ) upon the trapped bead using linear momentum conservation .",
    "forces along the optical axis ( @xmath15 direction ) , despite being measured in the single ",
    "trap setup described in @xcite , are not measured in the dt setup . the change in the @xmath16 components of the outgoing momentum flux ( fig [ fig : califorcmet]a ) is detected by using position sensitive detectors ( psds ) , which emit two current signals , @xmath17 proportional to the forces along the two orthogonal directions ( fig . [ fig : califorcmet ] b ) . throughout the paper",
    "the tether is taken to be aligned along the @xmath18 axis which is the direction defined by the straight line joining the centers of the two traps .",
    "we will thus focus our attention on the @xmath18 component of the force .",
    "calibration of the instrument amounts to the measurement of the conversion factor , @xmath19 , between force and current :    * force measurement and calibration . *",

    "different responses are obtained because of different drag forces .",

    "[ fig : califorcmet ] b ) .",
    "this can be done by applying a known force on the trapped bead and measuring the psd response .",
    "a practical way of doing this is using stokes law for the drag force on a spherical bead in a viscous flow , @xmath30 , where @xmath27 is the radius of the bead , @xmath26 the viscosity of the medium and @xmath31 the flow velocity .",
    "the flow is generated by moving the microfluidics chamber with respect to the optical trap at constant speed @xmath31 either along @xmath3 or @xmath18 .",
    "the conversion factors @xmath32 are then measured as : @xmath33 . as we emphasized in the introduction",
    "the most appealing feature of force measurement methods based on light momentum conservation is the robustness of calibration .",
    "conversion factors are determined by the optical setup and the responsivity of the detector , but they are independent of the details of the experimental setup , such as the index of refraction of the trapped bead , its size or shape , the refractive index of the fluid medium and laser power . to prove that this property holds in our setup we measured the psd response ( in arbitrary units , au ) along the direction of the flow using two different buffer solutions and beads of different materials and sizes .",
    "one set of experiments was performed using water as fluid medium and silica beads ( 3 and 4 @xmath34 , kisker biotech ) , the other set was performed using a high concentration solution of sucrose and polystyrene beads ( 3@xmath34 , spherotech ) .",
    "[ fig : califorcmet ] c shows the relation between the flow velocity and the psd signal along the direction of the flow .",
    "different fluids and different bead sizes lead to different results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : califorcmet ] c , inset ) because both the bead radius and the fluid viscosity influence the drag force .",
    "nevertheless if we normalize the psd signal by the product @xmath35 the different curves collapse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : califorcmet ] c , main plot ) , showing that the calibration factor is the same in all cases .",
    "however , trap stiffness and maximum trapping force do depend on the refractive indices of bead and medium .",
    "the typical performance of the trap , when using silica beads in water at 50mw of laser power per bead in the sample region , is shown in fig .",

    "pipette by air suction .",
    "a trap is then formed at the center of the bead and moved @xcite : when the trap is not focused at the center of the bead , the light exerts a force on the immobilized bead , which can be measured through the psd .",
    "the results concerning the shape of the trap are summarized in fig .",

    "the upper right inset shows the reflectivity parameter @xmath38 ( as defined in text ) as a function of the trap  to  trap distance .",

    "this experimental setup uses counter - propagating beams from different sources .",
    "it is thus free from cross - talk effects between the beams as described in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless a systematic source of error in the measurements can arise due to reflection effects . in the st configuration reflection",
    "is not a source of error .",
    "reflected light creates an actual force on the bead and the minitweezer optics collects and scores reflected light in the correct way to account for reflection forces . on the contrary in the dt setup the reflected light from one bead adds to the wrong psd . in fact when the light of one beam , say beam 1 , hits the surface of a trapped bead , part of the incoming radiation will be transmitted and part reflected .",
    "light reflected from beam 1 can then propagate backwards along the optical axis , reaching the psd which is meant to measure the force acting on beam 2 ( psd-2 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the signal reaching psd-1 is composed of light from beam 1 which has been transmitted and light from beam 2 which has been reflected and vice - versa for psd-1 .",
    "( this is not a problem in the st setup as in that case one is only concerned with the total deflection of the two beams . ) in terms of the measured forces , let @xmath39 denote the measured signals due to transmitted and reflected light from laser @xmath40 respectively .",
    "if @xmath41 is equal to the net force signal measured in psd-@xmath40 , then we have : @xmath42 the magnitude of the reflection effect can be quantified : when two beads are optically trapped in the same fluid at rest , their static fluctuations are independent @xcite .",
    "the independence of the static fluctuations is expressed mathematically by saying that the covariance between the signals coming from the two traps is equal to zero .",
    "eq . can be used to show how , due to reflection effects , a spurious covariance can arise , even in absence of a true physical interaction between the two beads .",
    "the covariance is given by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes thermal average .",
    "note that in the last equality we used the independence of force fluctuations in the two beads and @xmath45 . a relative measure of reflection effects is given by the reflectivity parameter @xmath38 @xmath46 where we take @xmath47 since @xmath48 .",
    "we have measured @xmath38 using pairs of silica beads trapped in water and recorded the two force signals at 50 khz acquisition bandwidth .",
    "such measurements were repeated at different trap  to  trap distances . in every case",
    "reflection effects proved less than @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ref ] upper right inset ) .",
    "we will now discuss the noise level in our setup and the different noise sources .",
    "we shall at first consider the ideal case in which the tether is perfectly aligned along the pulling direction in the infinite bandwidth limit to later introduce averaging and misalignment effects @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the resolution of dt setups is not limited by the trap stiffness @xcite .",
    "the two force signals coming from the traps can be linearly combined and the resolution is set by that combination which displays the least variance , the so - called differential signal . if the dt setup is symmetric , i.e. the traps have equal stiffnesses , the differential signal is simply given by the difference of the signals coming from both traps .",
    "if the traps are asymmetric , with stiffnesses @xmath50 and @xmath51 , a minimum in the variance of the linear combination : @xmath52 can still be found .",
    "the variance of @xmath53 is : @xmath54 and the minimum is found for @xmath55 these results are valid in the ideal case in which the tether is perfectly aligned along the pulling direction and there are no instrumental noise sources , such as electronic or ambient noise , which are nevertheless always present .",
    "misalignment @xcite is a major source of noise in our setup and does actually set the resolution limit .",
    "the different noise contributions are easily identified by looking at the noise power spectrum @xmath56 . in fig",
    "[ fig : vars]a we show the power spectrum of fluctuations in the differential coordinate using three different dsdna tethers of different lengths : 24kbps , 3kbps and 58bps @xcite .",
    "the force fluctuations spectra were converted to distance fluctuations using the trap stiffness ( 0.02 pn / nm in the dt setup , 0.06 pn / nm in the st setup ) , so that setups with different trap stiffnesses can be compared .",
    "the three power spectra obtained in the dt setup can be fitted with a double lorentzian behavior : @xmath57 the fast contribution is due to fluctuations along the pulling direction , while the slow contribution is due to misalignment and fluctuations along the optical axis .",

    "in this paper we report a novel dual  trap optical tweezers design that uses counter - propagating beams .",
    "this setup can be used to perform single  molecule manipulation , with most of the known advantages of all  optical setups , although lacking drift compensation between the two traps which characterizes co - propagating tweezers . in addition the new setup has the following features :    1 .   * direct force measurement . *",
    "the counter - propagating design offers the possibility to clearly separate the light coming from each trap , thus allowing to measure changes in light momentum in each beam separately , and therefore measure the force in each trap .",
    "the only source of mixing between the two light beams arises as a consequence of reflection effects by the trapped beads but these have been proven to be smaller than 3% .",
    "* force measurements on short tethers . *",
    "the setup has been shown to correctly measure forces , even when the beads are very close , down to @xmath9 20 nm .",
    "such measurements have not been reported in co  propagating setups .",
    "a comparison of the performance the two geometries on these tethers would be interesting .",
    "* low power . *",
    "the setup uses low laser power ( 50 mw per beam ) .",
    "although this limits the trap stiffness it also reduces the heating of the sample region , the tether damage from reactive oxygen singlets @xcite and possible optical binding effects @xcite .",
    "* versatility .",
    "* the setup described here shares the same optical design of the single  trap setup in @xcite , it is thus possible to switch from one to the other , according to the experimental situation , without even requiring a new calibration .    as any other design the counter - propagating setup also has some drawbacks :    1 .",
    "* low trap stiffness . *",
    "the low ( per watt ) trap stiffness is a consequence of the design of the instrument : in order to measure forces correctly all the light must be collected after it interacts with the trapped object and this sets an upper bound on the maximum numerical aperture ( na ) of the beams .",
    "nevertheless the low trap stiffness is not by itself a limit to the resolution of the dt setup .",
    "* misalignment .",
    "* misalignment is one of the problems which affect the counter - propagating design .",
    "it has been shown to affect the fluctuation spectrum ( section [ sectionfluct ] ) and to limit the resolution of the setup .",
    "its effects must be taken into account when measuring elastic fluctuations @xcite , but can be neglected in pulling or hopping experiments .",
    "we have developed a methodology to extract the stiffness of the optical traps and the tether based on measurements of force fluctuations in each trap .",
    "this method is based on the analysis of a generalized force signal @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "its fluctuation spectrum , making it possible to evaluate the trap yield at different forces and recover the fec curve of the tether with high fidelity .",
    "the greatest advantage of this methodology is the possibility to measure the stiffness of the optical traps over a range of forces ( @xmath90 pn in our setup ) where nonlinear effects are important and the approximation of a linear trap fails .",
    "such method is of interest for generic dt setups . above 10 pn this methodology",
    "can still be applied , however , a correction for the coupling with force fluctuations occurring along the optical axis must be included , as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a further development of the present work would be the design of a similar double ",
    "trap setup able to reach higher trap stiffnesses .",
    "even if one is not willing to increase the laser power , higher stiffnesses could be achieved in several ways . in the first place one could use laser beams with larger beam waist , which would lead to a larger effective numerical aperture and better trapping efficiency along the optical axis , although this could reduce the maximum trapping force .",
    "the minitweezers setup was initially designed to perform experiments in a single  trap setup where forces as high as 50 pn per trap are reached ( at @xmath950 mw laser power ) . in the dt setup and for comparable laser powers , it is difficult to reach forces above 20 pn , and the beam deflection is accordingly smaller",
    ". therefore it should be possible to increase the beam waist and still collect all the deflected light .",
    "indeed it has recently been shown that it is possible to use large numerical aperture beams while directly measuring forces @xcite , although this requires a more complex instrumental design .",
    "a second option would be the use of different beam modes as for example the donought - shaped @xmath91 .",
    "this idea has been explored theoretically by ashkin @xcite and has by now been given different experimental realizations . in this laser mode",
    "the intensity profile in the plane perpendicular to the optical axis shows a central dark spot surrounded by a bright ring .",
    "this should reduce the scattering force along the optical axis , which takes the greatest contribution from light rays at the center of the beam , and enhance the gradient force by the outer rays . in both cases , whether the beam waist is increased or the beam shape is changed , beads with a higher ( but not too high ) effective refractive index could be used leading to better maximum trapping forces and stiffnesses .",
    "the counter - propagating setup discussed in this paper is of direct interest to all labs using counter - propagating st setups for single molecule experiments , which could readily switch to the dt configuration .",
    "moreover the same design could be useful to those willing to implement direct force measurement in a dt setup in a simple way .",
