    "the formulation of light front qcd is one of the most innovative enterprises in recent theoretical hadron physics .",
    "it resumes the pioneering efforts of the seventies in the parton model @xcite .",
    "its intention is to connect the successful parton model at large resolution @xmath0 with the constituent quark picture of hadrons appearing in spectroscopy .",
    "the new start @xcite is not without a knowledge of the problems which have been experienced in the first works .",
    "it is well documented that renormalization in hamiltonian field theories is , with currently available methods , more cumbersome than in covariant descriptions .",
    "a naive gauge fixing procedure on the light front leads to an easy resolution of gauss law .",
    "however , this naive method is not correct ",
    "the correct method involves so ",
    "called ` zero mode ' degrees of freedom dependent on the transverse coordinates .",
    "these zero modes can not be gauged away , and become an integral part of the dynamics .",
    "in addition we expect that the nontrivial vacuum structure evident from equal time quantization brings new induced couplings into the light front hamiltonian .",
    "our investigation concentrates on the role of the zero mode fields .",
    "we start from the near light front frame advocated by the st .",
    "petersburg and erlangen groups @xcite and introduce a finite volume ( @xmath1 in the spatial directions ) , thereby controlling possible infrared singularities .",
    "this choice of coordinate system involves quantization on a space  like surface , which makes it easier to relate the occurring phenomena to equal time physics",
    ". however , all the usual complexities of negative energy states and nontrivial vacua are also present .",
    "an axial gauge is natural in the infinite momentum frame : the axis of motion singles out a preferred direction .",
    "the chosen gauge @xmath2 is actually a variant of the axial gauge , since the latter is incompatible with the boundary conditions .",
    "consequences include the appearance and quantization of the zero  mode gauge fields @xmath3 which depend only on the two transverse coordinates and can be chosen color diagonal .",
    "the asymmetrical dependence of the zero modes on only the transverse coordinates coincides with the asymmetry of the space coordinates in this near light front frame .",
    "explicitly , the light front spatial @xmath4 direction stems from mixing the former spatial @xmath5 coordinate with the former time @xmath6 .",
    "the zero modes degrees of freedom appear in a transverse hamiltonian which is coupled to three  dimensional dynamics via the fermions , transverse gauge fields and the light front coulomb law . in the strong coupling limit the kinetic term of the transverse hamiltonian becomes dominant and , in this limit , the hamiltonian is identical to a hamiltonian describing independent rotators at each lattice site .",
    "this is the starting point of our investigation . using basis functions according to this dominant kinetic term",
    ", we make an expansion of the zero mode hamiltonian . in the strong coupling basis",
    "we also evaluate the coulomb term and find indications that the interaction of external sources is confining .    in hamiltonian formulations quantized on the exact light front , the zero modes @xmath3 correspond to high energies .",
    "they are infinitely long wavelength excitations with respect to the spatial variable @xmath4 , and , simultaneously , they are very short wavelength ( ultraviolet ) excitations with respect to the time variable @xmath7",
    ". therefore some approaches @xcite include the zero mode physics in their renormalization program , without explicitly solving their dynamics . in our approach of near light cone",
    "coordinates , the zero modes are independent degrees of freedom and retained after the solution of gauss law , since they correspond to gauge invariant quantities ( as evident in their role as eigenphases of the polyakov loops ) .",
    "resolution of the gauss law constraint indeed does not permit the elimination of their conjugate momenta @xmath8 .",
    "the existence of zero modes indicates that the local color charge of all external sources will be singlet  all hadronic bound states must be color singlets .",
    "this is the first requirement of color confinement .",
    "the second requirement for color confinement dictates that the interaction energy increases with increasing separation . to make a reliable calculation in this case",
    ", one has to know , besides the light front coulomb potential , how gluon fields propagate in the ` background ' field @xmath9 over large distances .",
    "it is argued that on a strongly coupled lattice the background field modifies the behavior of transverse plane gluon waves with color charge . due to the fluctuations of the background they are limited to propagate over short distances .",
    "thus they can not cancel the linear confinement potential induced by the gauge choice . in this way",
    ", the axial gauge supports confinement from the beginning and therefore seems to be the best starting point for qcd .",
    "[ confine ] however , confinement is not so obvious for neutral transverse gluon fields , whose two - dimensional longitudinal zero mode part has been eliminated in the procedure of solving the gauss law constraint .",
    "light front gauge theories have been set up using the so  called near light front frame @xcite , which enables one to study the approach to the exact light front . the tilted coordinates",
    "are defined as @xmath10 the transverse components @xmath11 and @xmath12 are unchanged ; @xmath13 is the new time coordinate and @xmath14 is the remaining spatial coordinate . as finite quantization volume we will take a torus and its extension in @xmath4 , as well as in @xmath11 , @xmath12 direction is @xmath15 .",
    "the metric tensor reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "it defines the scalar product of two 4-vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 obviously , the exact light - cone is approached as the parameter @xmath22 goes to zero . for non ",
    "zero @xmath23 , the transition to the near light front coordinates from an equal time frame can be formally identified as a lorentz boost combined with a linear transformation which avoids time dependent boundary conditions @xcite , as required in the canonical formulation .",
    "the boost parameter @xmath24 for this lorentz transformation ( in the @xmath5 direction ) is given by @xmath25 indicating that for @xmath26 the relative velocity of the two frames @xmath27 .",
    "this is connected to the interpretation of the near light front frame in terms of the infinite momentum frame . as discussed previously ,",
    "the use of these near light front coordinates allows us to quantize the theory on a spacelike surface at equal light front time .",
    "this is important , as the ends of our ` box ' are spacelike separated , and can thus exchange no information . note the contrast to conventional light front coordinates , in which the ends of the ` box ' are separated by a light  like interval which , in turn , implies that the surface of quantization contains points which can be causally connected .",
    "the spectrum of massless partons @xmath28 with transverse momentum @xmath29 can be easily calculated from their dispersion relation which reads in the near light front coordinates @xmath30 in our coordinates , @xmath31 is the energy variable ( being conjugate to @xmath7 ) and @xmath32 is the longitudinal momentum variable .",
    "this dispersion relation has two @xmath31 solutions , an upper branch @xmath33 and a lower branch @xmath34 @xmath35 in the limit of small @xmath23 , eq . ( [ disp1 ] ) goes over into the conventional light front energy @xmath36    in figure [ disp ] , we show these two branches together with the light front hamiltonian @xmath37 . we have taken the maximum transverse momentum @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and all energies and momenta are in units of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the lattice spacing .",
    "note that negative momentum states correspond uniquely to negative energy states in the conventional light front formalism , but with our choice of coordinates , this clean division no longer holds .",
    "however , it is true that for small @xmath23 , the negative momentum states with positive energy are of very high energy , indeed .",
    "one possible procedure to find the momenta for regularization of these high energy states is to calculate the longitudinal momenta corresponding to a maximum absolute energy @xmath42 for @xmath43 , this cutoff corresponds to @xmath44 in @xmath45 and renders the dispersion relation single  valued once again : a unique energy @xmath31 corresponds to each momentum @xmath32 .",
    "since we are finally interested in using @xmath46 as our effective hamiltonian , the upper energy cutoff gives the minimal @xmath32 momentum where this approximation still makes sense .",
    "when we use the expression in eq .",
    "( [ plc ] ) for @xmath46 we obtain a minimal @xmath47 , resulting from our energy cutoff . to introduce an efficient light front effective theory ,",
    "it is necessary to eliminate partons with negative @xmath32 states with special attention to the partons with @xmath48 .",
    "this procedure will not be discussed here , but we believe that this elimination is very important in order to obtain a constituent quark picture on the light front",
    ". we would further comment that our effective hamiltonian approach discussed in the next chapter may provide a workable framework to include these high energy modes .",
    "this paper is divided in six sections . in the next section we review the qcd hamiltonian in the case of these tilted light front coordinates . in section 3",
    "we give the solution to the zero mode sector in the strong and weak coupling approximations .",
    "a calculation of the ground state energy in the two site approximation is presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 contains a discussion of confinement .",
    "finally , we summarize in section 6 .",
    "canonical formulations of qed in the axial gauge and in the light front gauge have been developed in analogous ways  starting from the respective canonical weyl gauges .",
    "after the implementation of the gauss law constraints , the resulting hamiltonians appear to be rather similar @xcite .",
    "moreover , the qcd hamiltonian in axial gauge representation has recently been derived @xcite . here",
    "we will outline the derivation of the near light front qcd hamiltonian , which has been given by the erlangen group @xcite also .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the color gauge group @xmath49 and dynamical gluons ; only an external ( fermionic ) charge density @xmath50 is considered here .",
    "general @xmath51 results , including dynamical fermions , are given in the appendix .",
    "the lagrangian in the near light front coordinate system reads @xmath52 where the color index @xmath41 is summed from 1 to 3 , and the transverse coordinates are labeled by @xmath53 .",
    "we will also use the matrix notation ; for example @xmath54 , where the @xmath55 are the @xmath49 matrices .",
    "the field strength tensor contains the commutator of the gauge fields : @xmath56 \\ , , \\ ] ] with the coupling constant @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58 coordinates have no momenta conjugate to them . as a consequence ,",
    "the weyl gauge @xmath59 is the most natural starting point for a canonical formulation .",
    "the canonical momenta of the dynamical fields @xmath60 are given by @xmath61 from this , we get the weyl gauge hamiltonian density @xmath62 we choose periodic boundary conditions in @xmath4 and @xmath63 on intervals of size @xmath64 $ ] . using the appropriate periodic delta functions ,",
    "the quantization is straightforward .",
    "however , the hamiltonian has to be supplemented by the original euler  lagrange equation for @xmath65 as constraints on the physical states @xmath66 with the covariant derivatives @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the structure constants of @xmath49 .",
    "these equations are known as gauss law constraints . since the gauss law operator commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath69     = 0 , \\ ] ] time evolution leaves the system in the space of physical states .",
    "furthermore , @xmath70 is invariant under time independent residual gauge transformations whose generator is closely connected to gauss law @xcite .    in order to obtain a hamiltonian formulated in terms of unconstrained variables , thus rendered available for approximations without breaking local gauge invariance , one needs to resolve the gauss law constraint .",
    "this is an important step , since it frees us from implementing additional restrictions on operators or states .",
    "a hamiltonian expressed in terms of unconstrained variables appears more complicated , but it is our belief that there is much to gain from this apparent increase in complexity .    via unitary gauge fixing transformations @xcite one indeed can achieve this resolution with respect to components of the chromo  electric field .",
    "these transformations render a hamiltonian independent of the conjugate gauge fields . in other words , the latter become cyclic variables .",
    "let us choose the ` @xmath71 ' ( minus ) components as the variables to be eliminated .",
    "classically this would correspond to the light front gauge @xmath72 .",
    "however , this choice is not legitimate for our setup in a finite box .",
    "only the ( classical ) coulomb light front gauge ( @xmath73 ) is compatible with gauge invariance and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the reason is that @xmath74 carries information on gauge invariant quantities , such as the eigenvalues of the spatial polyakov ( wilson ) loop @xmath75 \\ , , \\ ] ] which can be written in terms of a diagonal matrix @xmath76 @xmath77 v^{\\dagger } \\ , .\\ ] ] thus , we obviously need to keep these ` zero modes ' @xmath76 as dynamical variables , while the other components of @xmath74 are eliminated .",
    "the zero mode degrees of freedom are independent of @xmath4 and , therefore , correspond to quantities with zero longitudinal momentum .",
    "the unitary gauge fixing transformation can indeed be chosen in such a way that @xmath74 becomes cyclic , apart from the zero modes mentioned @xcite . in order to eliminate the conjugate momentum , @xmath78 , by means of gauss law",
    ", one needs to ` invert ' the covariant derivative @xmath79 .",
    "after the unitary transformation @xmath79 simplifies significantly ( compare to eq .",
    "( [ deriv ] ) ) @xmath80 where this is understood as an operator equation : e.g. @xmath81 $ ] for arbitrary f. now gauss law can be readily resolved : in the space of physical states one can make the replacement @xmath82 the inversion of @xmath83 can be explicitly constructed in terms of its eigenfunctions , cf .",
    "the zero mode operator @xmath84 is also diagonal and @xmath85 is the conjugate momentum to @xmath86 .",
    "it has eigenvalue zero with respect to @xmath83 , i.e. @xmath87 , and is therefore not constrained .",
    "the appearance of the zero modes also implies residual gauss law constraints . in the space of",
    "transformed physical states @xmath88 , they read @xmath89 these two  dimensional constraints can be handled in full analogy to qed , since they correspond to the diagonal part of color space .",
    "this further gauge fixing in the @xmath49 3direction is done via another gauge fixing transformation , which leads to the coulomb gauge representation in the transverse plane for the neutral fields . in other words ,",
    "we eliminate the color neutral , @xmath4independent , two  dimensional longitudinal gauge fields @xmath90 here we use the periodic greens function of the two dimensional laplace operator @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are integers .",
    "the conjugate momenta of these fields , @xmath94 , are defined analogously .",
    "resolution of the residual gauss law allows one to replace them , in the sector of the transformed physical space @xmath95 , by the neutral chromo  electric field @xmath96 at this point it is convenient to introduce the unconstrained gauge fields and their conjugate momenta : @xmath97 these relations turn out to be important for neutral gluon exchange ; recall that the subtracted fields are diagonal in color space .",
    "note that the physical degrees of freedom @xmath98 and @xmath99 still contain @xmath100independent , color neutral , modes .",
    "therefore , there is a remnant of the local gauss law constraints  the global condition @xmath101 the physical meaning of this equation is that the neutral component of the total color charge , including external matter as well as gluonic contributions , must vanish in the sector of physical states .",

    "the operator @xmath108 is defined as @xmath109    in table 1 we show the number of degrees of freedom for the different stages of the gauge fixing procedure . in order to count , we discretize configuration space as @xmath110 sites .",
    "constraints of course reduce the number of independent variables and are therefore subtracted .",
    "originally there are three vector components of the gluon field in three colors at each site .",
    "gauss law represents three ( color ) constraints at each site . after the first unitary transformation we arrive at a intermediate hamiltonian",
    "which is not explicitly given in the text .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom as well as the number of constraints have been reduced .",
    "note that the residual gauss law is two  dimensional and color neutral .",
    "finally , we arrive at a formulation where there is only one global constraint left .",
    "concomitantly , the final @xmath111 still contains the global color neutral zero mode which has not been subtracted ( cf .",
    "( [ sub ] , [ green2 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , one explicitly sees that the number of independent unconstrained degrees of freedom is @xmath112 at _ any _ stage of the formal development .    .counting the degrees of freedom in the @xmath49 hamiltonians [ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     the formulation of axial gauge near light front qcd for @xmath49 gauge fields is complete at this point . for details of the rather subtle derivation",
    "we refer to original references @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a pedagogical review and @xcite for a critical discussion focusing on topological aspects . in @xcite",
    "the method using unitary transformations has been applied to qed quantized on the exact light cone .",
    "the above hamiltonian already is rather complex and nonlocal , just as the most familiar example of a gauge fixed theory , coulomb gauge qed . despite the complexity it serves as a promising starting point for further studies since",
    "approximations can be made without breaking local gauge invariance .",
    "the principal advantage of an exact light front formulation is the apparent triviality of the ground state which simplifies calculations of the hadron spectrum .",
    "the light front vacuum , however , is not guaranteed to be trivial in the zero mode sector . in using the near light front coordinate system , we can study the complex zero mode structure influencing the dynamics of long distances .",
    "the zero mode sector in light front physics differs from equal time hamiltonian physics where the long range physics is low energy physics . as can be seen from the dispersion relation for massless particles on the light front ,",
    "@xmath113 soft modes ( states with small momenta ) become high energy states . in this way ,",
    "high energy physics becomes tied to long range physics , contrary to the equal time formulation .",
    "this physics appears in deep inelastic scattering at small scaling variable and is related to the long distance features of the proton .",
    "we will focus on the zero mode sector in order to try to acquire some insight into its dynamics . therewith we hope to obtain a sound basis for further numerical studies .    from the comparison of abelian and non - abelian theories , striking differences show up in the zero mode sector .",
    "recently , in the equal time formalism , the zero mode sector in qcd has been claimed to be relevant for the confinement phenomenon @xcite .",
    "on the level of approximations and restrictions followed below , the formal differences between light front and equal time approach are rather small and , consequently , results and methods are similar .    in this work",
    "we do not restrict ourselves to the strong coupling approximation .",
    "we will , however , start with the strongly coupled theory to define our set of basis functions . as before , we will restrict ourselves to @xmath49 without matter  pure gluonic yang - mills theory .",
    "it already has the typical non - abelian features such as the coulomb term which explicitly contains the zero modes in the denominator and the non - standard kinetic energy for the zero modes .",
    "the zero mode degrees of freedom couple to the three  dimensional gluon fields via the second term in @xmath114 shifting the longitudinal momenta of the transverse gluon fields ( eq . ( [ hamil ] ) ) .",
    "they affect the coulomb term and the two  dimensional electric fields @xmath115 .",
    "the latter coupling is typical for the light front and is absent in the equal time case .",
    "we neglect these couplings and consider the pure zero mode hamiltonian @xmath116 . \\label{hamil3}\\ ] ] this hamiltonian is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) with only the zero mode @xmath117 and its conjugate momentum retained , and an integration over the longitudinal variable .",
    "we recognize ` electric ' and ` magnetic ' contributions in @xmath118 , the zero mode hamiltonian  the first and second term , respectively .",
    "the light front variables mix the ordinary spatial and time variables so the labeling above is to be understood in analogy with the equal time hamiltonian .",
    "even at this level of approximation , this zero mode hamiltonian differs from the corresponding one in qed .",
    "the reason is the hermiticity defect of the canonical momentum : @xmath119 .",
    "this might seem to be a strange property for a momentum operator , but is perfectly allowable , in analogy with the naive radial schrdinger momentum operator which is also non  hermitian .    for notational simplicity",
    ", we now omit the color index and work with the schrdinger representation of eq .",

    "the measure also appears in the integration volume element for calculating matrix elements .",

    "we rewrite @xmath130 with @xmath131.\\ ] ] it should be noted that the coefficients of the two terms are reciprocals of each other .",
    "since the integral over transverse coordinates can contain arbitrarily small wavelengths , we have to regularize the above hamiltonian @xmath128 .",

    "we separate the hamiltonian into electric and magnetic contributions : @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 note that we do not introduce ` radial wave functions ' nor effective potentials as in @xcite . for each lattice site @xmath132",

    "@xcite weak coupling variational solutions for the full @xmath49 lattice hamiltonian are given .",
    "furthermore , studies in ( 1 + 1)dimensional yang - mills theory @xcite give formal extensions to construct wave functions for @xmath51 gauge theories .    the magnetic term of the hamiltonian couples nearest neighbor lattice points . in the strong coupling limit",
    "its contribution may be obtained perturbatively ( as it has the coefficient @xmath160 ) by evaluating it with the basis function of the ground state .",
    "the result of this is @xmath161 since this energy is proportional to @xmath162 and @xmath163 grows linearly with @xmath15 , this part of the zero mode dynamics represents a negligible surface effect for the three  dimensional system in the strong coupling approximation .",
    "next , we discuss the weak coupling limit @xmath164 . in this case",
    "we can simplify the kinetic term of the hamiltonian by defining new variables @xmath165 : @xmath166 with @xmath167 then the reduced hamiltonian becomes : @xmath168 expanding this for small @xmath57 , we obtain @xmath169    the eigensolutions of this hamiltonian are known to be spin waves .",

    "in the weak coupling limit the zero mode hamiltonian supports solutions similar to qed . the strong coupling limit , however , yields different results : ` gluonic ' excitations are suppressed because of large energy gaps .",
