    ". then apart from the interest in its own right the differentiation of @xmath1 distinguishes , in an unexpected manner , some number theoretic properties of real numbers .    let @xmath18 be a real number and @xmath59 be a positive increasing function defined on positive integers .",

    "almost every real number is not well approximable by rationals @xcite , we can say that @xmath1 is flat almost everywhere or its almost all increases are possible by discontinuous jumps only .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here that bullett and sentenac @xcite found a devil s staircase in a similar setting .",
    "the @xmath24-expansions that are mechanical words were also considered .",

    "more precisely , to given @xmath67 , they assigned the @xmath27-orbit whose _ rotation number _ is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "in fact they considered , though the way of construction , its inverse function to follow the usual definition of a devil s staircase : ` the graph of a non - constant function which is continuous , monotonic and locally constant on a set of full measure . '",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the function @xmath1 established in this paper is , however , nowhere constant and thus does not fit the definition of a devil s staircase .",
