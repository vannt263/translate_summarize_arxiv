    "the leading models for gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) , bursts of 0.1 - 1 mev photons typically lasting for 0.1 - 100 seconds ( fishman & meegan 1995 ) , involve a relativistic wind emanating from a compact central source .",
    "the ultimate energy source is rapid accretion onto a newly formed stellar mass black hole .",
    "observations suggest that the prompt @xmath1-ray emission is produced by the dissipation ( perhaps due to internal shocks ) of the kinetic energy of a relativistically expanding wind , i.e. a `` fireball '' .",
    "both synchrotron and inverse compton emissions from the shock - accelerated electrons have been proposed as the grb emission mechanism .    in this paper , we study in detail the production of neutrinos by protons accelerated along with electrons .",
    "we assume that equal energy of the fireball is dissipated in protons and electrons ( or photons ) .",
    "this is the case in models where grbs are the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "the basic idea is that the protons produce pions decaying into neutrinos in interactions with the fireball photons , or with external photons surrounding the newly formed black hole .",
    "where previous calculations have estimated the universal diffuse flux of neutrinos produced by all grbs over cosmological time , we estimate the flux from individual grbs observed by the batse ( burst and transient source experiment ) experiment on the compton gamma - ray observatory . the prediction can be directly compared with coincident observations performed with the amanda detector . having these observations in mind",
    ", we specialize on neutrino emission coincident in time with the grb .",
    "opportunities for neutrino production exist after and , in some models , before the burst of @xmath1-rays , e.g. when the fireball expands through the opaque ejecta of a supernova .",
    "the calculations are performed in two models chosen to be representative and rather different versions of a large range of competing models .",
    "the first is generic for models where an initial event , such as a merger of compact objects or the instant collapse of a massive star to a black hole , produces the fireball ( waxman & bahcall 1997 ; guetta , spada & waxman 2001a , gsw hereafter ) .",
    "we calculate the neutrino production by photomeson interactions of relativistic protons accelerated in the internal shocks and the synchrotron photons that are emitted in these shocks .",
    "the neutrinos produced via this mechanism have typical energies of @xmath2 ev , and are emitted in coincidence with the grbs , with their spectrum tracing the grb photon spectrum . for an alternative model , we have chosen the supranova model where a massive star collapses to a neutron star with mass @xmath3 , which loses its rotational energy on a time scale @xmath4 of weeks to years , before collapsing to a black hole , thus triggering the grb . following guetta and granot ( guetta & granot 2002a )",
    ", we calculate the neutrino flux from interactions of the fireball protons with external photons in the rich radiation field created during the spindown of the supra - massive pulsar .",
    "production on external photons turns out to be dominant for a wide range of parameters , @xmath5yr for a typical grb and @xmath6yr for x - ray flashes .",
    "the neutrinos produced via this mechanism have energies @xmath7ev for typical grb ( x - ray flashes ) and are emitted simultaneously with the prompt @xmath1-ray ( x - ray ) emission .",
    "their energy spectrum consists of several power law segments and its overall shape depends on the model parameters , especially @xmath4 .",
    "if the mass of the supernova remnant is of the order of @xmath8 , and if the supernova remnant shell is clumpy , then for time separation @xmath9 yr the snr shell has a thomson optical depth larger than unity and obscures the radiation emitted by the grb .",
    "therefore , for @xmath10yr , the @xmath11 s would not be accompanied by a detectable grb providing us with an example of neutrino emission not coinciding with a grb display .    as previously mentioned , to realistically estimate the neutrino fluxes associated with either of these models , we turn to the grb data collected by batse .",
    "the batse records include spectral and temporal information which can be used to estimate neutrino spectra for individual bursts .",
    "we will perform these calculations for two version of each of the two models previously described .",
    "the two versions correspond to alternative choices of important parameters .",
    "the wide variety of grb spectra results , not surprisingly , in a wide range of neutrino spectra and event rates . for approximately 800 bursts in the batse catalog , and for four choices of models",
    ", we have calculated the neutrino spectra and the event rates , coincident with grbs , for a generic neutrino telescope . with 800 bursts ,",
    "the sample should also be representative for data expected from much larger next - generation neutrino observatories .",
    "neutrino telescopes can leverage the directional and time information provided by batse to do an essentially background - free search for neutrinos from grbs .",
    "individual neutrino events within the batse time and angular window are a meaningful observation",
    ". a generic detector with 1km@xmath12 effective telescope area , during one year , should be able to observe 1000 bursts over @xmath13 steradians . using the batse grbs as a template , we predict order 10 events , muons or showers , for both models .",
    "the rates in the supranova model depend strongly on @xmath4 . in this model",
    "we anticipate @xmath14 events per year assuming @xmath15 yr , but only one event per ten years for @xmath16 yr",
    ". we will present detailed tabulated predictions further on .",
    "they can be accessed at http://www.arcetri.astro.it/@xmath0dafne / grb/.    short duration grbs , characterized by lower average fluences , are less likely to produce observable neutrino fluxes .",
    "we find that grbs with lower peak energies , x - ray flash candidates , yield the largest rates in the supranova model .",
    "for instance , for @xmath17 yr , we predict one event ( muon or shower ) for every 1000 bursts .",
    "if only 100 , or so , x - ray flashes occur per year , as observations suggest , this will be difficult to observe .",
    "however , such events may be considerably more common and may contribute significantly to the diffuse high energy neutrino flux .",
    "observations of neutrinos from this class of grbs would be strong evidence for a supranova progenitor model .",
    "the amanda collaboration has collected neutrino data in coincidence with batse observations ( barouch & hardtke 2001 ) .",
    "it operated the detector for 3 years ( 1997 - 1999 ) with an effective area of approximately 5,000m@xmath12 for grbs events . in early 2000",
    "the expanded detector reached an effective area of roughly 50,000m@xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , only @xmath0100 coincident bursts could be observed with the completed detector before batse operations ceased in june 2000 . with effective areas significantly below the canonical square kilometer discussed in this paper ,",
    "amanda is not large enough to test the grb models considered here .",
    "we estimate only 0.08 events in 1997 - 1999 and 0.3 in 2000 .    our estimate of 110 events in 1 year for a telescope with 1 kilometer square telescope area is consistent with previous , burst - averaged , determinations of the grb neutrino flux ( alvarez , halzen & hooper 2000 , dermer & atoyan 2003 ) .",
    "note that the effective area of icecube for grb will significantly exceed this reference value ( pdd ) .",
    "the rate can be understood by a back - of - the - envelope estimate .",
    "a typical grb produces a photon fluence on the order of @xmath18 , which we assume to be equal to the energy in protons .",
    "if @xmath19 of the proton energy is converted into pions , half to charged pions , and one quarter of the charged pion energy to muon neutrinos in the @xmath20 decay chain , then @xmath21 neutrinos are generated . for a typical neutrino energy of @xmath22 ,",
    "this yields @xmath23 neutrinos per square kilometer . at this energy",
    "the probability that a neutrino converts to a muon within range of the detector is @xmath24 ( gaisser , halzen , stanev 1995 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath25 muons are detected in association with a single grb .",
    "with over 1000 grbs in one year , we estimate a few muons per year in a kilometer - square detector .",
    "fluctuations in fluence and other burst characteristics enhance this estimate significantly ( see figure [ figevn ] , for instance ) , however , absorption of neutrinos in the earth can reduce this number .",
    "these effects are included in the calculations of actual event rates throughout this paper .",
    "our estimates , while observable with future kilometer - scale observatories , may be conservative .",
    "we already mentioned bursts with no counterpart in photons .",
    "also , occasional nearby bursts , much like supernova , could exceptionally provide higher event rates than our calculations reflect .",
    "we would like to point out the fact that the aim of the paper is not to do more precise calculations than the ones already done in the literature . we just want to generate results that can be compared with experiments that do coincidents observations with satellites .",
    "the outline of the paper is somewhat unconventional .",
    "the detailed results are collected in a data archive at http://www.arcetri.astro.it/@xmath0dafne/grb .",
    "the details of the calculations of the neutrino fluxes in the two models are described in appendices a and b. in appendix c we collected the methods used to evaluate the rates of neutrino - induced muons , taus and showers in a generic detector with a given effective telescope area .",
    "the main body of the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we review grb models and describe the mechanisms for neutrino production in grbs . in  3 and  4",
    "we describe the batse catalog of grbs and we identify subclasses of events : long duration grbs with and without measured redshift , short duration grbs and x - ray flash candidates . in ",
    "5 we summarize our simulation of the response of a generic high energy neutrino telescope to the predicted neutrino fluxes . in  6 we analyse some anomalous bursts . results and conclusions",
    "are collected in  7 .",
    "progenitor models of grbs are divided into two main categories .",
    "the first category involves the merger of a binary system of compact objects , such as a double neutron star ( eichler et al .",
    "1989 ) , a neutron star and a black hole ( narayan , pacyski & piran 1992 ) or a black hole and a helium star or a white dwarf ( fryer & woosley 1998 ; fryer , woosley & hartmann 1999 ) .",
    "the second category involves the death of a massive star .",
    "it includes the failed supernova ( woosley 1993 ) or hypernova ( pacyski 1998 ) models , where a black hole is created promptly , and a large accretion rate from a surrounding accretion disk ( or torus ) feeds a strong relativistic jet in the polar regions .",
    "this type of model is known as the collapsar model . an alternative model within this second category",
    "is the supranova model ( vietri & stella 1998 ) , where a massive star explodes in a supernova and leaves behind a supra - massive neutron star ( smns ) , of mass @xmath3 .",
    "it subsequently loses its rotational energy on a time scale @xmath4 of order weeks to years until it collapses to a black hole .",
    "this triggers the grb .",
    "long grbs ( with a duration @xmath26 ) are usually attributed to the second category of progenitors , while short grbs are attributed to the first category .",
    "we select two models to investigate the opportunities for neutrino production in a grb .",
    "the analysis can be easily extended to other models ( see for example razzaque , mszros & waxman 2002 ; dermer & atoyan 2003 ) . the first model is based on the standard fireball phenomenology where electrons and protons are shock accelerated in the fireball .",
    "pions and neutrinos are produced by photoproduction interactions when the protons coexist in the fireball with photons .",
    "these are produced by synchrotron radiation of accelerated electrons . for a second model we turn to the supranova scenario where the supra - massive pulsar loses its rotational energy through a strong pulsar wind",
    "this pulsar wind creates a rich external radiation field before the collapse to the final black hole and the creation of the grb fireball .",
    "it is referred to as the pulsar wind bubble ( pwb ) ( knigl & granot 2002 ; inoue , guetta & pacini 2002 ; guetta & granot 2003 ) and provides a target for the photoproduction of neutrinos by fireball protons .",
    "let s note in passing that the supranova model has several advantages compared to other collapsar models : ( i ) the jet does not have to penetrate the stellar envelope ( vietri & stella 1998 ) , ( ii ) it can naturally explain the x - ray line features observed in several afterglows ( piro et al . 2000 ;",
    "lazzati , et al . 2001 ; vietri et al .",
    "2001 ) , and ( iii ) the large fraction of the internal energy in the magnetic field and in electrons observed in the afterglow emission arise naturally ( knigl & granot 2002 ; guetta & granot 2003 ) .    in all of the different scenarios mentioned above , the final stage of the process consists of a newly formed black hole with a large accretion rate from a surrounding torus , and involve a similar energy budget ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "observations suggest that prompt @xmath1-ray emission is produced by the dissipation of the kinetic energy within the fireball , due to internal shocks within the flow that arise from variability of the lorentz factor , @xmath28 , on a time scale @xmath29 .",
    "the afterglow emission is thought to arise from an external shock that is driven into the ambient medium as it decelerates the ejected matter ( rees & mszros 1994 ; sari & piran 1997 ) . in this",
    "so called ` internal - external ' shock model , the duration of the prompt grb is directly related to the time during which the central source is active .",
    "the emission mechanism is successfully described by synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons that radiate in the strong magnetic fields .",
    "these are close to equipartition values within the shocked plasma . an additional radiation mechanism that may also play some role",
    "is synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) ( guetta & granot 2002b ) , which is the upscattering of the synchrotron photons by relativistic electrons to higher energy .",
    "protons are expected to be accelerated along with the electrons in the region where the wind kinetic energy is converted into internal energy due to a dissipation mechanism like internal shocks .",
    "the conditions in the dissipation region allow proton acceleration up to @xmath30ev ( waxman 1995 ; vietri 1995 ) .",
    "the energy in @xmath1-rays reflect the fireball energy in accelerated electrons and afterglow observations indicate that accelerated electrons and protons carry similar energy ( freedman & waxman 2000 ) .",
    "our basic assumption in calculating neutrino emission from grbs is that equal amounts of energy go into protons and photons . in models where grb protons are the source of the highest energy cosmic rays ,",
    "this assumption is supported by the approximate equality of the @xmath1-ray fluence of all grbs and the total energy in extragalactic cosmic rays .",
    "both internal shocks , responsible for the prompt grb emission , and the external shock , responsible for the afterglow emission , have been proposed as possible sources of the highest energy cosmic rays ( waxman 1995 and vietri 1995 , respectively ) .",
    "a comparison between the two mechanisms has been done by vietri , de marco and guetta ( 2003 ) , but it is not easy to conceive , at this point , an observational test capable of distinguishing between the two models .",
    "the only hope appears to observe the production of high energy neutrinos which must accompany the _ in situ _ acceleration of particles .",
    "occasionally , ultra - high energy protons will produce pions and neutrinos in collisions with photons in photon rich environment provided by the post  shock shells or by the pulsar wind bubble .",
    "if the protons are accelerated in internal shocks , the neutrinos produced will arrive at earth simultaneously with the photons of the burst proper and will have an energy @xmath31 ( waxman and bachall 1997 ; gsw ; guetta & granot 2002a ) .",
    "if accelerated in external shocks , they will arrive at earth simultaneously with the photons of the afterglow and will have a higher energy , @xmath32 ev ( vietri 1998a , 1998b , waxman & bahcall 2000 ) .",
    "general phenomenological considerations indicate that gamma - ray bursts are produced by the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistic expanding fireball .",
    "internal shocks that are mildly relativistic are believed to dissipate the energy .",
    "therefore , the proton energy distribution should be close to that for fermi acceleration in a newtonian ( non - relativistic ) shock , @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , the power law index of the electron and proton energy distributions are expected to be the same , and the values inferred for the electron distribution from the observed photon spectrum are @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "we shall , therefore , adopt @xmath33 .",
    "plasma parameters in the dissipation region allow proton acceleration to energies greater than @xmath36 ev ( waxman 1995 , vietri 1995 ) .",
    "we will assume that the fireball is spherically symmetric .",
    "note , however , that a jet - like fireball behaves as if it were a conical section of a spherical fireball as long as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the jet opening angle and @xmath39 is the wind lorentz factor .",
    "therefore , our results apply without modification to a jet - like fireball . for a jet - like wind",
    ", the luminosity , @xmath40 , in our equations should be understood as the luminosity of the fireball inferred by assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "we have relegated all details of the calculation of neutrino production via photomeson interaction with grb photons and pwb photons to appendices a and b , respectively . throughout the paper",
    ", we will refer to the models by the following convention :    * model 1 : neutrino flux from the interaction of high - energy protons with grb photons .",
    "the fraction of proton energy transfered to pion energy is set to 0.2 as indicated by simulations of gsw ( see apppendix a ) .",
    "* model 2 : neutrino flux from the interaction of high - energy protons with grb photons .",
    "the fraction of proton energy transfered to pion energy is calculated as described in appendix a ( see appendix a ) .",
    "* model 3 : neutrino flux from the interaction of high - energy protons with pwb photons , as in the supranova progenitor model .",
    "the time scale between supernova and grb is set to @xmath41 yr ( see appendix b ) .",
    "* model 4 : neutrino flux from the interaction of high - energy protons with pwb photons , as in the supranova progenitor model .",
    "the time scale between supernova and grb is set to @xmath42 yr ( see appendix b ) .",
    "batse , the burst and transient source experiment , was a high energy astrophysics experiment launched on the compton gamma - ray observatory in 1991 .",
    "batse , between its launch and the termination of its orbit in 2000 , has observed and recorded data from over 8000 events including gamma - ray bursts , pulsars , terrestrial gamma - ray flashes , soft gamma repeaters and black holes .",
    "the data batse recorded from gamma - ray bursts is publically available in the current batse catalog at http://f64.nsstc.nasa.gov / batse / grb / catalog/. for a description see paciesas et al .",
    "the catalog includes information on the spectrum , time and location of each triggered burst .",
    "each triggered event has been assigned a batse trigger number ( between 105 and 8121 for grbs ) which we use to identify individual bursts .",
    "spectral information is recorded in four energy channels , 20 - 50 kev , 50 - 100 kev , 100 - 300 kev and above 300 kev . using these four fluence measurements ,",
    "we have fitted the spectrum of each grb to a broken power law , treating the break energy , both spectral slopes and the normalization as free parameters ; see eq.([eq : fnu ] ) .",
    "we determine the lorentz factor of the relativistic expanding ejecta using the break energy through eq.([eq : epeak ] ) . for bursts with an observed break energy above 300 kev , or below 50 kev , it is difficult to determine both the break energy and the power law slope . for high energy breaks , the impact on this ambiguity is not critical .",
    "as explained in appendix a , the lorentz factor is not dependent on the fit because it is fixed by the observed high energy of the event and the requirement that the fireball be optically thin .",
    "for very low spectral breaks ( below 50 kev ) , for instance in events we classify as x - ray flash candidates , we acknowledge a significant degree of uncertainty in the lorentz factor calculation and resulting neutrino spectra . in this case",
    ", the spectral break is only uncertain to about a factor of 2 or 3 .",
    "detailed temporal information is available in the batse catalog , in the form of light curves .",
    "the batse time resolution varies between 2.048 seconds and 0.016 seconds .",
    "a resolution of 0.064 seconds is available for all bursts during the time following the trigger .    in the framework of the internal shock model",
    ", we need a variability time , @xmath29 , @xmath43 in order to get the 1mev @xmath44 ( guetta , spada & waxman 2001b , waxman 2001 ) .",
    "in fact with a value of the lorentz factor larger than the minimal value needed to be optically thin up to 100 mev ( @xmath45 see eq.[eq : gamma ] ) the variability time , @xmath29 , has to be @xmath46 to get the 1 mev @xmath1-rays .",
    "how well the data support the model is still controversial and a detailed analysis on this issue is out of the aim of our paper . since we refer to this model for our analysis we consider a value of @xmath47 ms for long duration grbs in the rest of the paper . for short duration",
    "bursts we take @xmath48 ms and 0.050 seconds for x - ray flash candidates .",
    "we have divided the list of batse grbs into four different classes : 1 ) long duration bursts ( duration @xmath26 ) with measured redshfit , 2 ) long duration bursts without measured redshift , 3 ) short duration bursts and 4 ) x - ray flashes .",
    "major differences in temporal and spectral properties of long duration grbs , short duration grbs and x - ray flashes has lead to some speculation that they may involve different progenitors or mechanisms .      by observing the optical afterglow of grbs , it is possible to measure spectral lines and , therefore , the redshift of an individual burst .",
    "although to date the x - ray afterglow of on the order of 100 long duration grbs have been observed , only 31 of them have been observed in the optical making a determination of the redshift possible .",
    "( no redshift has been identified for short grbs ) .",
    "we first consider 13 of these that have a complete batse record .",
    "the relationship between the comoving distance to an object and its redshift is given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the fractions of the critical density of the universe in dark energy and matter , respectively .",
    "@xmath52 is hubble s constant .",
    "once the distance to a grb is known , and its fluence ( or flux ) has been measured , the isotropic - equivalent @xmath1-ray luminosity can be calculated . from this and the value of @xmath53 , together with the break energy of the grb photon spectrum , we estimate the bulk lorentz factor using eqs.([eq : gamma ] , [ eq : epeak ] ) . setting the efficiency for pion production @xmath54 for model 1 and using eq.([eq : fpi2 ] ) for model 2",
    ", we estimate the fraction of proton energy transfered into pions .",
    "using eqs.([eq : synclos ] , [ eq : synclos2 ] ) the energy scale of synchrotron losses , @xmath55 , is determined . from these informations",
    "we can determine the neutrino flux at earth for each of the four models .",
    "for a more detailed discussion see appendices a and b.      for the majority of the long duration bursts in the batse catalog no redshift is available . in this case , the @xmath1-ray luminosity of long duration bursts , and , therefore , the distance , can be estimated by assuming a relationship between the observed variability and the luminosity of a grb ( lloyd - ronning & ramierz - ruiz 2002 ; zhang & meszaros 2002 ; kobayashi , ryde & macfadyen 2002 ) .",
    "note that the variability of a grb is not the same as its variability time , @xmath29 , previously introduced .",
    "the variability of burst is a measure of fluctuations in the temporal structure of the burst .",
    "it is defined such that pure noise should have a variability of zero , while the most variable bursts have very sudden and distinctive temporal features .",
    "we use the following definition of variability ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ) : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the background subtracted fluence in a time bin @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the average background in a single time bin , @xmath61 is the maximum fluence and @xmath62 is the average fluence over a time period centered at time bin @xmath59 of length 30% of the @xmath63 time ( duration ) of the burst .",
    "the grbs with observed redshifts have been used to empirically derive a relationship between the variability and the luminosity of the burst ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ; reichart et al .",
    "2001 , reichart & lamb 2001 ) : @xmath64 a relationship between luminosity and the time lag between the peaks for light curves in different energy bands , has been observed in the grb redshift data ( norris , marani & bonnell 2000 ) , but appears to be less reliable .",
    "therefore , we will only consider the luminosity - variability relationship .",
    "together with the fluence ( flux ) of a burst , the distance of a burst can be determined by the luminosity .",
    "note that the variability , and therefore luminosity , of a burst depends on the redshift or distance to the burst .",
    "therefore , we must do this calculation by iteration .",
    "the end result is a value of the luminosity and redshift for each burst .",
    "we would like to enphasize the fact that there are a lot of uncertainties in this way to estimate the redshift , however the knoweledge of the redshift is not so important in our analysis since the minimum variability time scales and the fluence are the most important quantities .",
    "it is difficult to reliably calculate the variability of bursts with low flux .",
    "for this reason , we only consider bursts with a peak flux greater than 1.5 photons/@xmath65 ( over a 0.256 s time scale ) and with at least 30 time bins ( of 0.064 s width ) of 5 sigma or more above the average background .",
    "the grbs which do not meet these requirements have low fluence and are therefore likely to yield a low neutrino flux anyway .",
    "after these criteria were applied , 566 long duration bursts without measured redshift are left , making it our largest class .    even for bursts which meet the above criteria ,",
    "the luminosity estimated is only accurate to an order of magnitude .",
    "this corresponds to uncertainties of a factor of 2 or 3 in the fraction of proton energy transfered into pions and in the synchrotron loss energy .",
    "short duration grbs , with no observation of an optical afterglow and , therefore , no measurement of redshift , can not have a relationship between variability and luminosity empirically established .",
    "additionally , variability is difficult to measure for short duration bursts . left with no way to measure the @xmath1-ray luminosity of , or distance to , a short duration grbs",
    ", we choose to set @xmath66 for each burst .",
    "this introduces greater uncertainty than in the long duration grbs case but , given the ambiguities in the burst characteristics , it is the best that can be done at this time . to be consistent , we considered only short bursts with a peak flux greater than 1.5 photons/@xmath67 ( over a 0.256 s time scale ) , as we did with for long duration grbs .",
    "after this criteria was applied , 199 short duration bursts remained in this category .",
    "temporal structure and variations appear to occur on shorter time scales for short compared to long grbs ( mcbreen et al .",
    "we therefore use a time scale of temporal fluctuations of @xmath68 for all short duration bursts , as opposed to the value of @xmath69 used for long duration bursts .",
    "it is also interesting to note that short duration bursts generally have a somewhat harder spectrum and higher peak energy than long duration grbs ( paciesas et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "x - ray flashes are a newly discovered class of fast transient sources .",
    "the bepposax experiment s wide field cameras have observed such events at a rate of about four per year ( heise et al .",
    "2001 , kippen et al .",
    "2002 ) , implying a total rate on the order of @xmath70 per year .",
    "these events typically have peak energies as low as 2 - 10 kev and durations of 10 - 100 seconds .",
    "the bepposax experiment discriminates x - ray flashes from standard grbs by the non - detection of a signal above 40 kev with the bepposax grb monitor .",
    "more generally , a large ratio of x - ray to @xmath1-ray fluence is the differentiating characteristic of x - ray flashes from grbs .",
    "it has been suggested , however , that x - ray flashes are a low peak energy extension of gamma - ray bursts ( heise et al .",
    "2001 , kippen et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the final class considered here consists of batse events which may be x - ray flashes .",
    "we identify 15 events in this class with spectra that peak below 50 kev , although it is difficult to determine accurately where the peak occurs because the sensitivity of batse is somewhat poor in this energy range .",
    "these are long duration bursts , and typically have a hard spectrum ; several have @xmath71 in eq.([eq : fnu ] ) larger than 1.5 , and no observed flux in batse s fourth energy channel ( above 300 kev ) .    again , with no measured redshift , and limited temporal information , we can not deduce the luminosities of these events .",
    "we set @xmath66 for each event and calculate its luminosity accordingly .",
    "it is thought that the radius of collisions in x - ray flashes is typically larger than in other grbs and , therefore , the time scale of fluctuations will generally be larger ( guetta , spada & waxman 2001b ) .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath72 .",
    "for some x - ray flashes the peak energy is very low ( 20 - 30 kev ) and the lorentz factor accordingly very high . increasing the time scale of fluctuations has the additional effect of lowering the lorentz factor to a reasonable value in these extreme cases ( see eq.([eq : epeak ] ) ) .    for x - ray flashes , with a very large lorentz factor and a long time scale of fluctuations , we expect that a very small fraction of proton energy converted to pions ; see eqs.([eq : fpi1],[eq : fpi2 ] ) .",
    "we therefore expect low neutrino fluxes from proton interactions with grb photons .",
    "for the models involving proton interactions with photons in a surrounding pulsar wind bubble , however , the rates can be quite high ( guetta & ganot 2002a ) .",
    "there is another class of objects that are the non - triggered bursts .",
    "they are found in the batse data in off - line analysis ; see e.g. stern and tikhomirova + ( http://www.astro.su.se/groups/head/grb@xmath73archive.html ) .",
    "they are not energetic enough to trigger in real time .",
    "these can be grbs with low kinetic luminosity and will be very weak neutrino sources for all the four models , therefore we have decided to neglect them in our analysis .",
    "we have constructed a database publicly accessible online with a complete list of all of the grb characteristics and associated neutrino event rates for the approximately 800 bursts we have considered in this analysis .",
    "the data was populated in a mysql database , interacting through a user - friendly web interface developed with perl .",
    "the database is searchable by grb number and/or by grb class , and is capable of searching for only bursts included in the amanda analysis or all bursts in this work .",
    "the rates are for a generic neutrino telescope provided the threshold is sufficiently low for observing the neutrino fluxes predicted .",
    "how we transform the grb neutrino fluxes into observed event rates is the topic of the next section .",
    "representative results are tabulated in tables 1 through 12 .",
    "the database also contains the predicted neutrino spectra for each burst ; these can be directly combined with the simulation of a specific detector .",
    "the database is accessible at http://www.arcetri.astro.it/@xmath0dafne/grb .",
    "large volume neutrino telescopes are required to observe and measure the neutrino flux from grbs .",
    "current experiments , such as amanda ( andres et al .",
    "2001 ) at the south pole , or future ( aslanides et al . 1999 ) and next generation experiments , including icecube ( see http://icecube.wisc.edu/ ) with a full cubic kilometer of instrumented detector volume , i.e. with @xmath74 telescope area , are designed to observe high energy cosmic neutrinos with energies expected from grbs .",
    "neutrino telescopes detect the cherenkov light radiated by showers ( hadronic and electromagnetic ) , muons , and taus that are produced in the interactions of neutrinos inside or near the detector .",
    "muons are of particular interest because , at the energies typical for grb neutrinos , they travel kilometers before losing energy .",
    "the dominant signal is , therefore , through - going muons .",
    "icecube can measure the energy and direction of any observed muon .",
    "the angular resolution is less than @xmath75 while the energy resolution is approximately a factor of three .",
    "signal and background muons may , therefore , be differentiated with a simple energy cut . for shower events the energy measurement improves significantly ,",
    "being better than 20% , but reconstructing their direction is challenging , the angular resolution being of order 10 degrees .    for high energies ,",
    "when tau decay is sufficiently time dilated , taus have a range similar to or larger than muons , and so the dominant tau signal is from through - going taus .",
    "these events have a characteristic signature consisting of a `` clean '' minimum - ionizing track despite its long range inside the detector .",
    "we will therefore consider all events in which a tau track passes through the detector in the direction and at the time of a grb .",
    "we assume that taus and muons are distinguishable at all energies when specializing to rare events in coincidence in time and direction with a grb .",
    "we realize that , in general , it may be difficult to distinguish a muon of energy @xmath76 gev , that is expected to lose relatively little energy from catastrophic processes , from a very high energy tau .",
    "tau signatures however become dramatic when they decay inside the detector ( lollipop events ) , or when the tau neutrino interacts and the produced tau decays into showers inside the detector ( double bang events ) .    to evaluate the prospects for grb neutrino observations , it is essential to determine the rate of muon , shower and tau events .",
    "these calculations are each described in appendix c. for a review of high energy neutrino astronomy ; see ( halzen & hooper 2002 ; learned & mannheim 2000 ) .",
    "there are a few grbs we have considered in this analysis which are anomalous for a variety of reasons .",
    "we briefly mention these in this section .    *",
    "grb 6707 is a burst with a measured redshift of 0.0085 , yet a relatively low fluence of @xmath77 .",
    "together , this implies a luminosity on the order of @xmath78erg / s , well below the normal range considered .",
    "our calculation of the lorentz factor , which depends on the luminosity of the grb , yields a value of about 25,000 , much larger than the normally allowed range .",
    "results in model 2 are , therefore , not particularly realistic for this particular burst ( the rates are actually very low for this model ) .",
    "the other models are only affected by this in the calculation of the synchrotron energy loss scale . *",
    "grbs 7648 , 6891 and 1997 each have lorentz factors below 100 . in all three cases ,",
    "the burst has been found to have a low luminosity , @xmath79erg / s , which contributes to this result .",
    "the results of models 2 , 3 or 4 are only affected by this in their low synchrotron energy loss scales , and are , therefore , conservative .",
    "results for model 1 should be interpreted with caution for these three grbs . *",
    "grbs 1025 and 8086 , both long duration bursts , have been found to have very low variabilities and , therefore , low luminosities .",
    "this results in very high lorentz factors in our calculation ( 20,000 and 5,000 , respectively ) . given the uncertainties involved in the variability calculation and the variability - luminosity relationship , we feel that these luminosities and lorentz factors are unlikely to accurately represent these bursts .",
    "as already mentioned , our results are summarized in a series of tables .",
    "they summarize our fits to the batse data that provide the input spectrum for calculating the neutrino emission .",
    "the neutrino event rates for the 4 classes and the 4 models are also tabulated ( see tables 1 through 8) . in tables 9 - 12 , we summarize the event rates for a generic kilometer - scale telescope , such as icecube , for the 4 classes of grbs . for the duration and in the direction of a grb",
    ", the background in a neutrino telescope should be negligible .",
    "therefore individual events represent a meaningful observation when coincident with a grb .",
    "we next evaluate the prospects for such observations .",
    "the amanda experiment has operated for approximately four years ( 1997 - 2000 ) that overlap with the batse mission ( barouch & hardtke 2001 ) .",
    "data has been collected for several hundred grbs with an effective telescope area of order 5,000 m@xmath12 .",
    "amanda - ii , the completed version of the experiment , with approximately 50,000 m@xmath12 effective area for the high energy neutrinos emitted by grbs , was commissioned less than half a year before the end of the batse mission .",
    "nevertheless , of order 100 bursts occurred during that period for which coincident observations were made . with effective areas significantly below the reference square kilometer of future neutrino telescopes",
    ", amanda is not expected to test the grb models considered here . for long duration grbs , the most common classification",
    ", we anticipate on the order of 0.01 events ( muons+showers ) per square kilometer per grb for models 1 and 2 . for amanda - ii , with one twentieth of this area , and only capable of observing northern hemisphere grbs ( @xmath80/yr ) , we predict on the order of .3 events ( muons+showers ) per year of observation .",
    "amanda - b10 , with smaller area , should observe one tenth of this rate .",
    "it is interesting , however , to note that such experiments are on the threshold of observation at this time .",
    "icecube with a square kilometer of effective area , now under construction , will likely cross this threshold .    for the high energies considered here",
    ", icecube should be able to make observations of 1000 bursts over @xmath13 steradians during one year .",
    "where models 1 and 2 are concerned , we expect that an event ( muon or shower ) will be observed from roughly 10 grbs . for models 3 and 4",
    "we predict @xmath14 events per year for models with @xmath17 yr ( model 4 ) , but only around one event per ten years if @xmath81 is somewhat larger , such as 0.4 yr ( model 3 ) .",
    "the prospects for observation depends strongly on @xmath81 , as expected .",
    "we expect that classes of grbs with lower average fluence , such as short duration grbs and x - ray flash candidates , will be more difficult to observe .",
    "x - ray flash candidates , although unlikely to be observable in models 1 and 2 , could possibly be observed in models 3 and 4 . if @xmath17 yr ( model 4 ) , we predict order one event ( muon or shower ) for every 1000 bursts . with only @xmath82 x - ray flashes thought to occur per year , such an observation will be unlikely . if such events are more common , however , they may contribute significantly to the diffuse high energy neutrino flux .",
    "observations of neutrinos from low peak energy grbs would be strong evidence for a supranova progenitor model .",
    "it is interesting to note that the majority of the neutrino events from grbs come from a relatively small fraction of the grb population ( alvarez , halzen & hooper 2000 ; halzen & hooper 1999 ) . in figure [ figdist ]",
    "we show some of the factors which go into this conclusion .",
    "the occasional nearby ( low redshift ) , large @xmath83 , high fluence and/or near horizontal burst can dominate the event rate calculation .",
    "the distribution of the number of events per burst ( or x - ray flash candidate ) is shown in figure [ figevn ] .    in summary",
    ", taking advantage of the large body of grb statistics available in the batse catalog , we have attempted to estimate the neutrino fluxes and event rates in neutrino telescopes associated with grbs for a variety of theoretical models .",
    "our analysis has yielded several conclusions :    * gamma - ray bursts with high fluence , most often long duration bursts , provide the best opportunity for neutrino observations . * for typical gamma - ray bursts , proton interactions with fireball photons",
    "provides the largest neutrino signal .",
    "we have also shown that the rates are relatively model independent . * for gamma - ray bursts with very low peak energies ,",
    "possibly associated with x - ray flashes , very little energy is transfered into pions ( and , therefore , neutrinos ) in interactions with fireball photons .",
    "interactions with a surrounding pulsar wind bubble , however , can yield interesting neutrino fluxes .",
    "this is an illustration that observation of neutrinos is likely to help decipher the progenitor mechanism . * while our calculations indicate that existing neutrino telescopes , such as amanda , are not likely to have the sensitivity to observe gamma - ray burst neutrinos , next generation , kilometer - scale observatories , such as icecube , will be capable of observing on the order of ten bursts each year",

    "the effect becomes important when the pion lifetime @xmath99s becomes comparable to the synchrotron loss time @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the energy density of the magnetic field in the shocked fluid .",
    "@xmath102 , the fraction of the internal energy carried by the magnetic field , is defined by the relation @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the collision radius .",
    "the collision radius @xmath105 is obtained from the consideration that different shells in the shocked fireball have velocities differing by @xmath106 , where @xmath28 is an average value representative of the entire fireball .",
    "different shells emitted at times differing by @xmath29 therefore collide with each other after a time @xmath107 , i.e. at a radius @xmath108 .",
    "a detailed account of the kinematics can be found in halzen & hooper 2002 .",
    "we can now compare the synchrotron loss time with the time over which the pions decay : @xmath109 here @xmath110 is the fraction of internal energy converted to electrons , @xmath111s is the time scale of fluctuations in the grb lightcurve , @xmath112erg / s is the @xmath1-ray luminosity of the grb and @xmath113ev , is the pion energy . in deriving eq.([t_syn ] ) we have assumed that the wind luminosity carried by internal plasma energy , @xmath114 , is related to the observed @xmath1-ray luminosity through @xmath115 .",
    "this assumption is justified because the electron synchrotron cooling time is short compared to the wind expansion time and hence electrons lose all their energy radiatively .",
    "the radiative losses become important for @xmath116 , which corresponds to @xmath117 , where @xmath118 neutrinos from muon decay have a lifetime 100 times longer than pions , the energy cutoff will therefore be 10 times smaller : @xmath119 above this energy , the slope of the neutrino spectrum steepens by two to ( @xmath120 ) .    to normalize the neutrino spectrum to the observed grb luminosity , we must calculate the fraction , @xmath83 , of fireball proton energy lost to pion production .",
    "the fraction of energy converted to pions is estimated from the ratio of the size of the shock , @xmath121 , and the mean free path of a proton for photomeson interactions : @xmath122 here , the proton mean free path is given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the number density of photons .",
    "the photon number density is given by the ratio of the photon energy density and the photon energy in the comoving frame : @xmath125 using these equations , and recalling that @xmath126 , we obtain that @xmath127 and the fraction of proton energy converted to @xmath87 s is @xmath128 this derivation was performed for protons at the break energy . in general , @xmath129 where @xmath130 is given by eq.([eq : epb ] ) .    as we can see from eq.([eq : fpi1 ] ) , @xmath83 strongly depends on the bulk lorentz factor @xmath28 .",
    "it has been pointed out by halzen & hooper ( 1999 ) and alvarez , halzen & hooper ( 2000 ) that , if the lorentz factor @xmath28 varies significantly between bursts , then the resulting neutrino flux will be dominated by a few bright bursts with @xmath83 close to unity .",
    "however , guetta , spada & waxman ( 2001a ) have shown that burst - to - burst variations in the fraction of fireball energy converted to neutrinos are constrained .",
    "first , the observational constraints imposed by @xmath1-ray observations , in particular the requirement @xmath131 mev , imply that wind model parameters @xmath132 ) are correlated ( guetta , spada & waxman 2001b ) and that @xmath28 is restricted to values in a range much narrower than @xmath133 .",
    "for instance , for values of @xmath1 much smaller than average the fireball becomes very dense with abundant neutrino production .",
    "such fireballs will also produce a thermal photon spectrum which is not the case for the events considered here .",
    "second , for wind parameters that yield @xmath83 values significantly exceeding 20% , only a small fraction of pion energy is converted to neutrinos because of pion and muon synchrotron losses as can be seen from e q.([eq : synclos ] ) .",
