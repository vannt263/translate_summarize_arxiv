    "when a solution of dna is heated , the double stranded molecules denature into single strands . in this process",
    ", looping out of at rich regions of the dna segments first occurs , followed eventually by separation of the two strands as the paired segments denature .",
    "this _ denaturation _",
    "process corresponds to a phase transition @xcite .",
    "a simple model of the dna denaturation transition was introduced in 1966 by poland and scheraga @xcite ( hereinafter referred to as ps ) and refined by fisher @xcite .",
    "the model consists of an alternating sequence ( chain ) of straight paths and loops , which idealize denaturing dna , consisting of a sequence of double stranded and single stranded molecules .",
    "an attractive energy is associated with paths .",
    "interactions between different parts of a chain and , more generally , all details regarding real dna such as chemical composition , stiffness or torsion , are ignored .",
    "it was found that the phase transition is determined by the critical exponent @xmath0 of the underlying loop class . due to the tractability of the problem of random loops , that version of the problem was initially studied by ps @xcite .",
    "the model displays a continuous phase transition in both two and three dimensions .",
    "it was argued @xcite that replacing random loops by self - avoiding loops , suggested as a more realistic representation accounting for excluded volume effects within each loop , sharpens the transition , but does not change its order .",
    "however , the sharp jumps observed in the uv absorption rate in dna melting experiments @xcite , which correspond to a sudden breaking of large numbers of base pairs , indicated that a first order phase transition would be the appropriate description .",
    "the question whether such an asymptotic description , which implies very long chains , is valid for relatively short dna sequences , has been discussed recently @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a directed extension of the ps model , being essentially a one - dimensional ising model with statistical weighting factors for internal loops , is widely used today and yields good coincidence of simulated melting curves with experimental curves for known dna sequences @xcite .",
    "another recent application of ps models analyses the role of mismatches in dna denaturation @xcite .",
    "a numerical approach to dna denaturation , which we will not discuss further , uses variants of the peyrard - bishop model @xcite , a hamiltonian model of two harmonic chains coupled by a morse potential .    with the advent of efficient computers ,",
    "it has more recently been possible to simulate analytically intractable models extending the ps class , which are assumed to be more realistic representations of the biological problem .",
    "one of these is a model of two self - avoiding and mutually avoiding walks , with an attractive interaction between different walks at corresponding positions in each walk @xcite .",
    "the model exhibits a first order phase transition in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the critical properties of the model are described by an exponent @xmath3 related to the loop length distribution , see also fisher s review article @xcite .",
    "this exponent is called @xmath0 again . indeed , for ps models",
    ", it coincides with the loop class exponent @xmath0 if @xmath4 , see below . within a refined model , where different binding energies for base pairs and stiffness are taken into account",
    ", the exponent @xmath3 seems to be largely independent of the specific dna sequence and of the stiffness of paired walk segments corresponding to double stranded dna parts @xcite .",
    "there are , however , no simulations of melting curves for known dna sequences which are compared to experimental curves for this model .    an approximate analytic derivation of the exponent related to this new model was given by kafri et al .",
    "@xcite using the theory of polymer networks .",
    "they estimated the excluded volume effect arising from the interaction between a single loop and two attached walks .",
    "this approach ( refined recently @xcite ) yields an approximation to the loop length distribution exponent @xmath3 , which agrees well with simulation results of interacting self - avoiding walk pairs @xcite .",
    "there is a recent debate about the relevance of this approximation to real dna @xcite .",
    "the polymer network approach , as initiated previously @xcite , led to a number of related applications @xcite .    in this article , we reconsider ps models for three principal reasons .",
    "firstly , the older articles are short in motivating the use of particular loop classes , which may be misleading in drawing conclusions about the thermodynamic effects of different loop classes .",
    "in fact , the loop classes discussed in the early approaches @xcite are classes of _ rooted _ loops and lead to chains which are not self - avoiding .",
    "this seems unsatisfactory from a biological point of view , since real dna is self - avoiding .",
    "secondly , the common view holds that ps models with self - avoiding loops can not display a first order transition in two or three dimensions .",
    "in fact , this view led to extending the ps class in order to find a model with a first order transition .",
    "however this view is incorrect , as we demonstrate by a self - avoiding ps model with self - avoiding loops .",
    "thirdly , the two exponents @xmath0 and @xmath3 , extracted from different expressions as described above , are used in the literature without distinction , although there are subtle differences , which we will point out .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give a rigorous discussion of ps models and their phase transitions .",
    "we derive the scaling functions which describe the behavior below the critical temperature , as the critical point is approached .",
    "we then derive the loop statistics , thereby analyzing the occurrence of the loop class exponent in the loop length distribution .",
    "the third section reviews the prevailing ps models , with emphasis on motivation for the underlying loop classes .",
    "we then introduce a self - avoiding ps model displaying a first order phase transition in two and three dimensions . in section [",
    "sec : exact ] , exactly solvable directed ps models are discussed .",
    "we will give explicit expressions for generating functions .",
    "the critical behavior of some of these models has been analyzed previously by different methods @xcite .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of models extending the ps class .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of some open questions .",
    "we define ps models and consider analytical properties of their free energies , thereby refining previous expositions @xcite in a rigorous manner .",
    "we analyze phase transitions , extract the asymptotic behavior of chains at temperatures near the phase transition by means of scaling functions , and consider the loop length distribution of chains .",
    "we consider a discrete model , defined on the hypercubic lattice @xmath5 .",
    "double stranded dna segments are modeled by paths , and single stranded dna segments are modeled by loops on the edges of the lattice . each loop is assumed to have two marked vertices to indicate where paths are attached .",
    "( like ps , we do not _ a priori _ assume the `` dna condition '' that the marked vertices divide the loop into parts of equal lengths .",
    "there is a recent discussion about the effect of mismatches @xcite . )",
    "any alternating sequence of paths and ( marked ) loops is called a _",
    "chain_. a _ ps model _",
    "consists of all chains obtained by concatenation of paths and loops from a given path class and a given loop class , where the initial segment and the final segment of a chain are both paths .",
    "( the case of an open end affects the behavior above the critical temperature @xcite and will not be considered here @xcite ) .",
    "note that , in general , such chains are not self - avoiding , in contrast to real dna .",
    "self - avoidance may be violated by paths , by loops , or by the way segments are concatenated .",
    "a chain is called _ segment - avoiding _ if there are no overlaps , i.e. , every two non - neighboring segments have no vertex in common , and every two neighboring segments have exactly the marked vertex in common .",
    "we call a ps model _ self - avoiding _ if paths and loops are self - avoiding and if all chains of the model are segment - avoiding",
    ". we will discuss below several examples of self - avoiding ps models , which arise from self - avoiding walks .",
    "the requirement of self - avoidance restricts the admissible path classes and loop classes .",
    "a simple subclass of self - avoiding ps models are directed ps models : we call a chain _ directed _ if there is a preferred direction such that the order of the chain segments induces the same order on the vertex coordinates ( w.r.t . the preferred direction ) , for each pair of vertices taken from two different chain segments .",
    "such chains are then segment - avoiding .",

    "using standard techniques @xcite , it is possible to derive a functional equation for the generating function of column - convex polygons counted by perimeter and , in addition , by their upper and lower walk length .",
    "the corresponding expression is , however , much more difficult to handle than ( [ form : cc ] ) , and there seems to be no practical way to extract the loop class exponent for the model with dna constraint . on the other hand ,",

    "we thus expect a value of @xmath257 , with a value of @xmath108 seeming plausible .",
    "this ps model would then be at the border between a first order and a continuous phase transition .    for the refined model , let us further assume that the upper and lower walk in a loop are not allowed to touch the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the loop class of the refined model can be described in terms of bar - graph polygons @xcite .",
    "these are column - convex polygons , one of whose walks is a straight line .",

    "we used standard methods of numerical series analysis @xcite to estimate the critical point and critical exponent of @xmath19 .",
    "an analysis with first order differential approximants , using the coefficients @xmath22 for @xmath268 , yields the estimates @xmath269 this is , to numerical accuracy , indistinguishable from @xmath270 , as expected , and @xmath205 .",
    "note that the phase transition condition @xmath255 is satisfied , since the loop generating function is bounded by that of column - convex polygons , which is known to satisfy the above inequality .",
    "the ps model with oriented rooted self - avoiding loops @xcite , reviewed in section [ sec : rsap ] , displays a continuous phase transition in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this led to the question whether introducing excluded volume effects between different segments of the chain can change the nature of the transition @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : sps ] , we introduced self - avoiding ps models in order to answer that question in the affirmative , staying within the ps class .",
    "another approach , which extends the ps class , consisted in simulations of self - avoiding walk pairs @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that these models are not ps models as defined in this paper , and that loop class exponents as defined in ( [ form : asympt ] ) bear no meaning for these models .",
    "the appropriate generalization is the exponent @xmath3 of the loop length distribution @xmath271 of the chain , which is assumed to behave in the limit @xmath82 like @xcite @xmath272 where @xmath273 is a scaling function , assumed to be constant in some analyses @xcite .",
    "then , the same conclusions as in section [ sec : phasetr ] about the nature of the phase transition determined by the loop length distribution exponent @xmath3 hold .",
    "this follows from the behavior of the mean loop length @xmath160 in the limit @xmath274 , which is obtained from ( [ form : pdf ] ) by integration , @xmath275 if @xmath276 , the mean loop length diverges , indicating a continuous transition . if @xmath277 , the mean loop length stays finite , indicating a first order transition @xcite .",
    "note that assumption ( [ form : pdf ] ) is not fully consistent with ps models : the behavior ( [ form : pslld ] ) is consistent with ( [ form : pdf ] ) , which justifies the use of the same name for the two exponents .",
    "we found ( [ form : mean ] ) to be satisfied for ps models if @xmath4 in section [ sec : stat ] . if @xmath106 , however , the mean loop length exponent is independent of @xmath0 for ps models ",
    "see ( [ form : psmean ] ) .",
    "this implies that a scaling form like ( [ form : pdf ] ) can not hold for ps models with loop class exponent @xmath106 .",
    "the simulation results are @xmath278 in @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath279 in @xmath2 @xcite , indicating a first order phase transition in @xmath1 and in @xmath2 .",
    "this led to the conclusion that introducing excluded volume effects between different segments to the ps model of rooted self - avoiding loops drives the transition from continuous to first order .",
    "the perturbative analytic arguments using the theory of polymer networks @xcite yield a very good approximation to the value of the loop length distribution exponent found in simulations .",
    "this suggests that the main mechanism responsible for the change of critical behavior in the ps model of oriented rooted self - avoiding loops is due to `` local '' excluded volume effects arising from forbidden attachments of paths to loops .",
    "we discussed ps models with emphasis on the order of their phase transitions .",
    "we re - analyzed the old model of oriented rooted self - avoiding loops @xcite and found that the resulting ps model is not self - avoiding .",
    "hence the conclusions about the order of the phase transition , which are most relevant to the recent discussions , rely on a model where most chain configurations are not self - avoiding and thus can not represent real dna . our self - avoiding ps model ( unique marking , with self - avoiding bridges and ( unrooted ) self - avoiding loops as defined in section [ sec : sps ] )",
    "yields a first order phase transition in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is expected that the other variants considered in section [ sec : sps ] also yield a first order phase transition , but a detailed ( numerical ) analysis is needed to answer this question , as in the discussion in section [ sec : sps ] .    for the presumably more realistic model of pairs of interacting self - avoiding walks ,",
    "our results suggest an interpretation of excluded volume effects , which complements the common one @xcite .",
    "the self - avoiding ps models of section [ sec : sps ] correctly account for excluded volume effects within a loop , but overestimate excluded volume effects between different segments of a chain , due to their directed chain structure . since this leads to a first order phase transition in @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ", we conclude that the relaxation of excluded volume effects between different segments of the chain does not change the nature of the transition .",
    "we also discussed several directed examples .",
    "one of these models displays a first order phase transition in @xmath1 . despite being exactly solvable ,",
    "these models seem to be of limited relevance to the biological problem due to their directed structure and other limitations .    the key question , as to which effects are responsible for the observed behavior in real dna , is only partially answered by these results .",
    "with respect to directed models , which also account for different base pair sequences , it seems surprising however that simulations of melting curves @xcite agree so well with experimental curves . in these simulations ,",
    "a heuristic critical exponent accounting for the statistical weight of internal loops has to be inserted .",
    "it has recently been suggested @xcite that a value more realistic than the commonly used fisher loop class exponent @xcite @xmath280 might be the loop length distribution exponent of the polymer network approximation @xcite @xmath281 .",
    "this suggestion implicitly assumes that the loop length distribution exponent of a non - directed model can be interpreted as an `` effective '' loop class exponent within a directed model .",
    "although appearing plausible , it seems difficult to give this assumption a quantitative meaning . on the other hand ,",
    "the meltsim simulation approach @xcite is robust against a change of parameters . indeed",
    ", melting curves can be simulated with satisfactory coincidence for both exponents , if the cooperativity parameter for the loops is adjusted accordingly @xcite .",
    "it would certainly be illuminating to obtain such simulated melting curves from a self - avoiding walk pair modeling .",
    "we also mention the recent debate about the relevance of the self - avoiding walk pair model to real dna @xcite .",
    "the stiffness of the double stranded segments does not seem to qualitatively alter the critical properties of chains @xcite , as can be seen by comparing the ps model result of section 2.1 , showing that critical properties are largely independent of the path generating function .",
    "the corresponding question of introducing energy costs for bending and torsion to single stranded segments has , to our knowledge , not been discussed . even within the ps class ,",
    "it is not clear how this affects the loop class exponents , since the changes just discussed might lead to loop classes with different exponential growth constants , but there is no argument as to how the exponents might change .    in conclusion , the question of the mechanisms applying in real dna which are responsible for the denaturation process and which explain multistep behavior as observed in melting curves , are still far from being satisfactorily answered in our opinion .",
