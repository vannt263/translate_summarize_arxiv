    "the recent observation by the totem collaboration @xcite of a non purely exponential behaviour of the differential @xmath5 elastic cross - section at @xmath6 tev ( lhc8 ) , is discussed in this note in light of two simple pomeron models @xcite containing a threshold singularity in the pomeron trajectory , as required by @xmath7-channel unitarity @xcite .",
    "these models are tested in a wide energy range , namely from isr to lhc , and in all cases analyzed we find good agreement with the data , in particular in the diffraction cone .",
    "attempts to relate the `` break '' seen at the isr to the square - root singularity in the amplitude ( trajectory ) go back to 1972 @xcite .",
    "an empirical model , based on the old phillips and barger ( pb ) model - independent description @xcite , has recently highlighted this relation @xcite .",
    "below we revisit the problem of modelling the elastic differential cross section also in model @xcite , that , however has no well - defined @xmath8-dependence build in .",
    "we shall also test the pb model , appended by a threshold singularity @xcite , with the present lhc8 data @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that unitarity constrains the analytic properties of the scattering amplitude .",
    "in particular , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , regge trajectories near the threshold behave as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lightest threshold , e.g. @xmath11 for the @xmath12 or pomeron trajectory .",
    "a good approximation to the lightest threshold is by a square root @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a free parameter , that in refs .",
    "@xcite was associated with the pion mass , @xmath15 .",
    "while the low - mass @xmath16 threshold is responsible for the low-@xmath0 structure ( the so - called  break \" near @xmath17 gev@xmath18 ) , the otherwise exponential shape of the forward cone is provided by the nearly linear behaviour of the pomeron trajectory beyond the break ( in fact , a smooth curvature ) and until @xmath19  gev@xmath18 . at large @xmath0",
    "the trajectory tends to its logarithmic asymptotics , but this is beyond the scope of the present study ( see , _ e.g. _ @xcite and earlier references therein ) .",
    "the non - exponential behaviour of the cone at low-@xmath7 was recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where two options were scrutinized , one with the above threshold singularity in the trajectory and the other one with the form factor , in the line of earlier suggestions by donnachie and landshoff ( see @xcite and earlier references therein ) . as already mentioned , recent measurements by the totem collaboration found deviation from the linear exponential behaviour of the elastic diffraction cone at @xmath1 tev @xcite .",
    "we argue that the structure seen at @xmath1 tev is a recurrence of that seen earlier at the isr , both resulting from the threshold singularity imposed by @xmath7-channel unitarity . to this end",
    "we use a simple regge - pole model extrapolating from the isr energy region to that of the lhc . in doing so",
    ", we use a single  effective \" regge trajectory that incorporates leading ( pomeron ) and non - leading regge exchanges . while in the isr energy region",
    "@xmath12 exchange is important , it is negligible at the lhc ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the present study we use two simple versions of the regge - pole model incorporating an  effective \" trajectory including the required threshold singularity , with and without a linear term added .",
    "we make a number of fits , one based only on the isr data to see its extrapolation to the lhc , and the other one including also the new lhc data .",
    "the first simple model analysed is the one from ref .",

    "we consider two cases ( variants ) :    * a linear term is present in the pomeron ( `` effective '' ) trajectory ( @xmath26 free parameter ) - denoted as _ with linear term _ ; * a linear term is absent in @xmath31 ( @xmath32 fixed ) - denoted as _ without linear term_.    in such case , the pomeron is regarded as a simple ` supercritical ' pole in the complex angular momenta plane , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "in the framework of the so - called dipole pomeron model ( dpm ) , the pomeron amplitude is regarded as a two - term amplitude being written as @xcite :    @xmath35}-\\epsilon_pr_2 ^ 2(s)e^{r_2 ^ 2(s)[\\alpha-1]}],\\ ] ]    where again    @xmath21    represent the pomeron ( `` effective '' ) trajectory and    @xmath36    @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath25 ( dimensionless ) , @xmath26 ( gev@xmath23 ) , @xmath14 ( gev@xmath27 ) and @xmath40 are free parameters . in this model , the energy - dependent functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , having logarithm growth in @xmath8 reflect the unitarization of the pomeron amplitude at high - energies . here , @xmath43 ( gev@xmath29 ) and",

    "just like with model 1 , we considered here also two possible cases ( variants ) , namely :    * a linear term is present in the pomeron ( `` effective '' ) trajectory ( @xmath26 free parameter ) - denoted as _ with linear term _ ; * a linear term is absent in @xmath31 ( @xmath32 fixed ) - denoted as _ without linear term _ ;    in this framework , from the amplitude in eq .",

    "( [ eq : dp ] ) - reflecting absorptive effects - plays a major role in the dip - bump region - we make the approximation @xmath45 , namely to neglect it as we are here primarily interested in the break at very small @xmath46 .",
    "in the following we shall briefly discuss our data analysis , presenting in the first place the datasets used in data reductions and then showing the main results achieved .",
    "the datates analyzed here are those of the elastic differential cross section for @xmath3 scattering @xcite at isr energies , namely in the interval @xmath47 gev as well as the recent ones at lhc7 , measured by the totem collaboration @xcite . in our first approach to data reductions ,",
    "the lhc8 data @xcite is not taken into account .",

    "here we show the results from a model - independent parametrization which can describe both the small and the large @xmath0 region and which had been proposed in 1972 by phillips and barger ( pb ) @xcite .",

    "@xmath57 which corresponds to the original pb formulation @xcite ; 2 .",
    "@xmath58 which includes a parametrization of the pion loop singularity , labelled as mbp1 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath59 ^ 2 $ ] which modifies the very small @xmath46 behaviour with a form factor type behaviour , labelled as mbp2 .    of interest to the present discussion is the second case , a square root singularity . to argue how this",
    "model results can be compared with the totem 8 tev data , we show a fit of the data using the model mbp1 , and the comparison with the ref model ( one exponential ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : refbp ] .",
    "we find that an independent fit , such as the one indicated by the red curve , can give a very good description of the data , confirming , in this model - independent description , the agreement with the presence of the pion loop singularity at very small @xmath46-values .",
    "the parameter values indicated in the figure correspond to option n.2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mbp ] ) and to a @xmath60 .",
    "we have studied the low-@xmath0 structure of the elastic differential cross section at lhc8 , recently reported by totem , using simple regge - pole amplitudes with a threshold singularity in the pomeron trajectory .",
    "our results hints at the possibility of interpreting this phenomenon as a recurrence of a similar effect seen at the isr , in the seventies . in this first approach",
    "we focus on the role of the two - pion loop in determining the fine structure of the diffraction cone , namely in affecting the local slope @xmath61 . despite the fact that other sources - such as a form factor , eikonal rescatterings and diffractive dissociation @xcite - can change the behaviour of @xmath61 at small @xmath46 , our strategy here was to separately investigate the insertion of a two - pion loop in the pomeron trajectory .",
    "therefore , we have tried to interpolate / extrapolate our fit results for diffraction cone from isr to lhc . while the interpolation is very good , the extrapolation is only qualitatively satisfactory and shall be investigated in much more detail in a future publication .",
    "however , we notice that , the reason of a small mismatch may be attributed mainly to the simplified treatment of multiple regge - pole exchanges replaced by a single  effective \" regge trajectory . while at the lhc the contribution from secondary trajectories in the nearly forward direction is negligible @xcite this is not true at the isr , where the @xmath12 trajectory may contribute by half of the total .",
    "two ways how to cure this insufficiency can be envisaged .",
    "one is by including all allowed / required regge exchanges , namely @xmath62 and the odderon , apart from the pomeron .",
    "the other one is to account for these by introducing energy - dependent parameters in a single  effective \" exchange .",
    "the fine structure of the cone can be better seen on the local slope @xmath63 .",
    "it should be , however , remembered that the result depends on the @xmath7 interval in which the slope is calculated .",
    "the relevant bins can be wide or narrow , overlapping or not .",
    "this point was recently discussed in ref .",
    "we also notice that simple and elegant formulae extrapolating the forward slope in energy was derived in ref .",
    "they read @xmath64 where the coefficient @xmath65 is determined explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the virtue of this formula , following @xcite from @xmath66channel unitarity is that it is model - independent in the sense that for the total cross section in its r.h.s .",
    "on can use either model extrapolations or experimentally measured values of the cross section . the problem with the trajectory is the same as discussed above : in eq .",
    "( [ js ] ) a single trajectory appears , providing exact predictions when the reaction is dominated by a single reggeon exchange , as is the case beyond 1 tev ( lhc ) , dominated by a single pomeron .",
    "otherwise , an effective trajectory should be used , as discussed above .",
    "we have used two simple and efficient models of the pomeron amplitude .",
    "the first , presented in sec .",
    "[ lnc ] , is based on a single pole with a supercritical pomeron intercept , as advocated by donnachie and landshoff @xcite .",
    "the second uses a dipole pomeron ( dp ) exchange . unlike the former , dp promotes logarithmically rising cross sections and consequently the pomeron is  softer \" , its  supercriticity \" @xmath67 being about half compared to the case of a simple pole . also , it contains absorption corrections , regulated by the parameter producing a diffraction minimum and quantified by the parameter @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dp ] ) . in this work",
    ", we fixed @xmath69 since we are away from the dip region .",
    "this choice improves the fits due to the reduction of the number of free parameters .",
    "the parametrization of trajectories is a key issue in the regge - pole theory .",
    "linear trajectories are popular for their simplicity , however they contradict unitarity and the analytic properties required by the @xmath70-matrix theory and the asymptotic constraints , particularly those imposed by the quark model and perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . for practical purposes",
    "one chooses a parametrization relevant to the given kinematical region . as shown in the present paper , the economic , parameter - free single square root parametrization , eq .",
    "( [ squareroot ] ) , used e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite produces too strong curvature in the cone , incompatible with the data , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : res_lnc72 ] , [ fig : res_dpm_epfixed ] and [ fig : res_lnc72_dpm_epfixed_lhc8 ] .",
    "the inclusion of a linear term balances this distortion providing good fits to the data .",
    "finally we note that the reason of non - observation of any fine structure in the cone at the tevatron or rhic may be attributed to poor statistics in relevant experiments .",
    "as already mentioned , that is one the reasons we did not perform fits using @xmath71 data .",
    "it is also possible that for the same reason it was not observed in diffraction dissociation either .",
    "future experiments may reveal similar effects at the very small @xmath46 domain of high - energy diffractive scattering process , either in elastic or inelastic processes .",
