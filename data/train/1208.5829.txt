    "a pyroelectric crystal develops a spontaneous electrical polarization when its temperature changes .",
    "@xcite its enthalpy can be expressed as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the internal energy , @xmath4 is an applied electric field , and @xmath5 is the polarization .",
    "it is possible to cycle the temperature and electric field , to drive the crystal through an order / disorder phase transition , such as the ferroelectric / paraelectric transition in perovskite crystals , to convert between heat and electric energies .",
    "the phenomena known as the electrocaloric effect ( ece ) , in which electrical energy is used to induce a temperature change , is directly related to this thermodynamic cycle .",
    "the ece is not only interesting from a fundamental science perspective , but also holds great potential for future technologies such as solid - state refrigeration .",
    "the ece was first discovered in 1930  @xcite , but there were few studies pursued until ferroelectric crystals , with permanent dipoles , were discovered .",
    "the initial studies focused on bulk ceramics including rochelle salt  @xcite , srtio@xmath6  @xcite , batio@xmath6 ( bto )  @xcite , and doped alkali halides  @xcite ; however , the engineering potential of these crystals was never realized .    in 2006",
    "et al_.  discovered the `` giant electrocaloric effect '' in zr - rich pbzr@xmath7ti@xmath8o@xmath6 ( pzt ) thin films .",
    "@xcite by using a thin film it was possible to apply ultra - high electric fields , to achieve an ece @xmath1 of 12  k. the discovery of the giant ece has revitalized the field and has inspired numerous recent studies investigating the impact of ultra - high electric fields on the pyroelectric response of other ferroelectric materials .",
    "the initial work focused on zr - rich pzt ,  @xcite and although this alloy is still being investigated ,  @xcite there has also been a great deal of interest in other perovskite crystals including @xmath9pbmg@xmath10nb@xmath11o@xmath6@xmath12pbtio@xmath6  @xcite , bto  @xcite , batio@xmath6srtio@xmath6 superlattices  @xcite , and srbi@xmath13ta@xmath13o@xmath14 layered oxides  @xcite .",
    "in addition there has been much interest in the development of polymer based ferroelectrics , such as poly(vinylidene fluoride - trifluoroethylene ) and poly(vinylidene fluoride - trifluoroethylene - chlorofluoroethylene ) .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we will focus on the bto compound for a variety of reasons : it is a well studied archetypical perovskite crystal that is relatively easy to produce , it exhibits an excellent pyroelectric response , it does not contain the toxin lead , its ferroelectric properties have the potential to be tailored by alloying or the creation of superlattice structures .",
    "the ece in bto has been previously studied as a thin film@xcite and as a thick film in a multi - layer stack .",
    "@xcite surprisingly , off - the - shelf bto multilayer capacitors have been shown to exhibit a reasonable electrocaloric response .",
    "@xcite there also has been a study of the properties of bto nanoparticles with core - shell geometries .",
    "@xcite    previous theoretical studies of bto have largely relied on thermodynamic models , for example the ginzburg - landau - devonshire model .",
    "@xcite while these have proven successful , they require a large amount of data to accurately parameterize the model .",
    "one alternative approach was demonstrated by cao and li in which they created a transverse ising model ( tim ) to study the ece in bto thin - films .",
    "they predict that compressive epitaxial strains result in increasing the temperature where the ece is maximum and tensile strains reduce the temperature .",
    "@xcite the tim model is particularly interesting because in addition to the spin exchange interactions , taken up to four spins , the effect of quantum fluctuations were also included .",
    "it is reported that increasing the strength of the quantum fluctuations results in shifting the ece to higher temperatures .",
    "_  have used a molecular dynamics approach to investigate nanodots of @xmath15 .",
    "they report the time dependency of the temperature when an alternating electric field is applied .  @xcite it is discovered that it may be possible to tune the ece in nanodots by adjusting the depolarization field , which in practical terms would be implemented by modifying the surface of the nanodot .    following this introduction",
    "the theoretical methods are presented .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "the manuscript concludes with a summary in section [ summary ] .",
    "here we predict the ece for bto using the model hamiltonian , @xmath16 which is derived in refs .",
    "the true atomic structure has properties that are determined by the complex chemical bonding between the atoms , but in the model system the complexity is reduced ; the collective atomic motion is coarse - grained by local softmode vectors @xmath17 and local acoustic displacement vectors @xmath18 of each unit cell at @xmath19 in a simulation supercell as well as the homogeneous strain components , @xmath20 .",
    "the terms in the hamiltonian bear a physical significance : @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the kinetic energy possessed by the local soft modes and the local acoustic displacement vectors , @xmath23 is the local mode self energy , @xmath24 is the long - ranged dipole - dipole interaction , @xmath25 is the short - ranged interaction between local soft modes , @xmath26 is the elastic energy from homogeneous strains , @xmath27 is the elastic energy from inhomogenous strains , @xmath28 is the coupling between the local soft modes and the homogeneous strain , @xmath29 is the coupling between the soft modes and the inhomogeneous strains , and @xmath30 is the electric enthalpy .",
    "each of the terms in eq.[eq : effective : hamiltonian ] is expanded to allow the hamiltonian to be expressed using the parameterization given in refs .",
    "the same set of parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite for batio@xmath0 is used in this letter .",
    "values of the 25 parameter are also given as supplementary data to this letter .",
    "the details of the molecular dynamics method are explained in refs .",
    "the method described here is encoded in the software package ` feram ` , which is distributed freely to the scientific community .",
    "the simulation uses a supercell of size @xmath31 and the temperature is scanned from 250  k to 900  k at an increment of @xmath32  k / step . for each temperature increment ,",
    "the system is thermalized for 20,000 time steps , after which the properties are averaged for 80,000 time steps , using a time step of @xmath33  fs . the simulations begin at low temperature with a @xmath34-polarized initial configuration that is random .",
    "as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , thermal expansion is simulated by including a temperature - dependent effective negative pressure @xmath35  gpa .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the parameterization used here offers an improved estimation of ferroelectric ( tetragonal ) to paraelectric ( cubic ) transition temperature and @xmath36 ratio as compared to earlier models  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe that this set of parameters also gives a good estimation of the pyroelectric properties .",
    "the complex interactions , such as the interaction of domain walls with crystal defects and interfaces that are present in experimental systems are not present here .",
    "this makes direct comparison between computational and experimental results challenging ; however , these calculations are intended to isolate the essential physics of the crystal and the pyroelectric response due to the bonds between the metal cations and the oxygen .",
    "it is anticipated that the fundamental behavior observed in these calculations will also be present in the experimental systems . in principle",
    "the predicted ece response will be observed in high purity single crystals of bto , although such experimental systems are challenging to prepare .",
    "simulations are performed for constant electric fields ranging from 25 to 310  kv / cm at an increment of 5  kv / cm .",
    "this temperature range focuses on the ferroelectric ( tetragonal ) to paraelectric ( cubic ) transitions , where the largest pyroelectric response should be observed .",
    "the @xmath34-component of polarization , @xmath37 , is calculated from the md simulation results and is plotted versus @xmath38 at constant @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig : t](a ) .",
    "the data are fitted with weighted splines to allow for the determination of @xmath40 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : e ] .",
    "cooling - down simulations are also performed and hysteresis in temperature is found when @xmath41 kv / cm , as seen in the @xmath42 kv / cm simulations in fig.1(a ) . in the simulations ,",
    "the phase - transition order changes from first to second around @xmath43 kv / cm . to focus our theoretical effort on the determination of the pyroelectric response without including the additional complexity of the latent heat of transformation ,",
    "only fields @xmath44 kv / cm are used in the present calculations .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the electrocaloric refrigeration @xmath1 is estimated using @xmath45 as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : deltat ] . for heat capacity ,",
    "experimental , temperature and electric - field independent value of @xmath46 or @xmath47 is used in this estimation  @xcite ; the coarse - graining used in the effective hamiltonian method makes it difficult to correctly estimate the heat capacity .",

    "( b ) the values of @xmath52 and @xmath50 are changed together to maintain a fixed value of @xmath54  kv / cm.,width=302 ]    because the phase transition becomes increasingly diffuse as the electric field is increased the greatest pyroelectric response , @xmath40 shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : deltat ] frame ( a ) the field gradient @xmath55 is varied and @xmath56 is held constant at 310  kv / cm .",
    "the magnitude of the ece @xmath1 is proportional to the magnitude of the field gradient , @xmath55 .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "the temperature where the maximum @xmath1 occurs is determined by the isothermal curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : t ] that makes the greatest contribution within the field range bracketed by @xmath49 and @xmath56 .",
    "for example , over the range @xmath57 and @xmath58  kv / cm the @xmath59 and 600.5  k curves have the greatest magnitude in fig .",
    "[ fig : e ] and the @xmath1 versus @xmath38 curve , in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltat ] ( a ) , peaks just above @xmath60  k.    it is observed by akcay _",
    "_  that not only is the field gradient , @xmath55 , important but also the absolute magnitude of the fields @xmath49 and @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltat ] ( b ) the field gradient is held constant at @xmath61 and @xmath49 is varied from 60 to 210  kv / cm . at larger absolute fields",
    "the diffuse nature of the phase transition results in a decrease in the magnitude of the ece @xmath1 as well as an increase in the temperature where @xmath1 is maximum . as a matter of practice",
    "this means that the ece will always occur above the curie temperature . comparing the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltat ] ( a ) and ( b ) it is observed that by keeping @xmath49 small it is possible to achieve large @xmath1 for small @xmath55 , and when @xmath49 becomes large it is necessary to have a large @xmath55 to have comparable @xmath1 .",
    "the implication of this observation is that compounds with antiferroelectric ordering , which require large @xmath49,@xcite may not be the optimal choice for producing a large ece .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated the use of our md method ` feram ` to estimate the ece as functions of temperature and external fields .",
    "the freely available method used here can be parameterized using first - principles results alone , and therefore can be extended to investigate systems that lack sufficient experimental data to produce an accurate thermodynamical model .",
    "we have demonstrated the effect of varying electric fields on the archetypical pyroelectric , bto , and have found that to produce a large ece for a relatively small field gradient , it is preferred to not have an antiferroelectric ground state , which will allow the use of modest fields . while admittedly the external electric fields consider here may be slightly high compared to the breakdown voltage of polycrystalline batio@xmath6 ; advancements in synthesis techniques , such as vapor deposition processes , hold the promise of creating affordable high quality ferroelectric thin films that can withstand these electric fields .",
