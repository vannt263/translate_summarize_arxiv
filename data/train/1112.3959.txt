    "the ultimate record of the formational histories of galaxies is found in the six - dimensional phase space of stellar positions and velocities , supplemented by additional information about ages and elemental abundances ( primarily iron - based metallicities ) .",
    "the halos of galaxies are natural hunting grounds for assembly clues in phase - space because of the preservative effects of the long dynamical times , and since any material entering a galaxy naturally has to traverse its halo .    indeed",
    ", it is a fundamental prediction of the current cosmological paradigm that the outer regions of galaxies should be constantly bombarded with smaller , infalling systems that persist as significant substructures while gradually becoming disrupted .",
    "this idea has been borne out qualitatively in recent years by observations of halo streams and shells in the nearby universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "massive elliptical galaxies are touchstones for this issue , since their spheroidal nature and their residence in the densest areas of the universe suggest particularly vigorous accretion histories",
    ". comparisons of these galaxies stellar luminosity profiles at high and low redshifts now provide indirect evidence that their outer envelopes grow tremendously in size up to the present day ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which may be naturally explained by accretion and mergers in a cosmological context @xcite .",
    "the most extreme examples of ongoing assembly are expected to be the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , whose typical locations at the centers of clusters should involve very active merger histories ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "current cosmologically - based models find that around half of the stellar mass growth of a present - day bcg occurred over the past 5  gyr via gas - poor mergers ( after an early formation epoch for the core regions ; @xcite ) .",
    "this theoretical picture has received very mixed support from comparisons of bcg stellar masses and surface brightness distributions at different redshifts @xcite .",
    "surveys for major mergers in action have found that these contribute significantly to recent bcg growth ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , but the contributions from minor mergers are unknown and the overall comparison to theory unclear .",
    "part of the difficulty is that even if accretion and mergers are important growth processes , the frequency of observing an ongoing event can be fairly low .",
    "thus it would be invaluable to go beyond purely photometric observations and delve into the phase - space of position , velocity , and metallicity for longer lived signatures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    within the local group",
    ", detailed phase - space studies are being undertaken using individual stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but are currently impossible in more distant galaxies .",
    "instead , bright stellar proxies may be used , such as planetary nebulae ( pne ; @xcite ) and globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "gcs are thought to form along with field stars , and as collections of @xmath1  @xmath2 stars each , they are visible at much greater distances , allowing their individual positions , line - of - sight velocities , and chemical properties to be measured as far away as @xmath1  50  mpc .",
    "the `` chemodynamics '' of gcs provided the watershed evidence for the accretion origin of the milky way s outer halo @xcite , where it is now thought that disrupting satellite galaxies have deposited many accompanying gcs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a similar scenario is now evident in the nearby spiral m31 , where some gcs are associated with halo substructures @xcite . in bcgs ,",
    "the presence of gcs in enormous numbers ( up to @xmath3 per system ) has long motivated suggestions that accretion is an important factor for these galaxies @xcite , although it is not clear how many of these gcs may have formed during in situ processes or mergers rather than being accreted .    various gc and",
    "pn - based studies of the halo kinematics of giant ellipticals and bcgs have turned up evidence for substructures that may imply active accretion events or mergers . in other cases ,",
    "accretion events are suggested by photometric substructures or by broad kinematical or chemical halo transitions @xcite .",
    "however , in no case has a halo feature been observed and modeled in enough detail to determine its origin and the implications for galaxy formation .    to go beyond the previous work on nearby bcgs by carrying out detailed phase - space studies of their halos ,",
    "there are two critical observational requirements beside sheer instrumental throughput : wide - field coverage and spectroscopic resolution .",
    "the former permits blind searches for halo substructures and demands a field of view of at least @xmath1  0.5  degree in order to probe galactocentric radii out to @xmath1  100  kpc or more in galaxies at @xmath1  15  mpc distances .",
    "the latter allows for a wide mass range of accreted galaxies to be probed ; e.g. , if a bcg has a characteristic velocity dispersion of @xmath4  300  and the precision of velocity measurements for halo tracers is @xmath5  50100  , as in many past surveys , then the observations are sensitive to mass ratios down to @xmath6  1:401:10 in dynamical mass .",
    "more minor mergers than these are certainly expected to be more frequent , and may comprise a dominant mode for halo assembly , so a velocity resolution of tens of  ( @xmath7 ) is preferable .",
    "we present here the first wide - field , large - sample spectroscopic survey of a bcg with velocity resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "our subject is m87 , the central elliptical in virgo , the nearest galaxy cluster at a distance of @xmath1  16.5  mpc .",
    "the gc system of m87 has seen decades of spectroscopic study ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but extending to radii of only @xmath1  40  kpc and with @xmath9 .",
    "until now , m87 could be characterized as a dynamically quiet galaxy , with only mild signs of interactions such as very faint stellar filaments in its far outer halo @xcite .",
    "our new gc study reveals the kinematics of one of these faint streams , and unveils an unsuspected , enormous shell - like substructure in phase - space .",
    "our paper proceeds as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] describes the observations and data reduction , and presents a basic overview of the halo substructures .",
    "sections  [ sec : shell ] and [ sec : outer ] analyze the characteristics and statistical significance of the large inner shell and outer stream , respectively .",
    "theoretical analyses of the substructure origins and dynamics are explored in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] summarizes the findings and outstanding questions .",
    "we have revisited m87 in a new - era high - precision wide - field survey of gcs .",
    "the main component of our data set is presented and discussed in detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s+11 ) . in brief",
    ", it is based on photometry from cfht / megacam and subaru / suprime - cam optical images , and spectroscopy from mmt / hectospec , keck / deimos , and keck / lris .",
    "new line - of - sight velocities were obtained for 451 gcs over a series of campaigns from 2007 to 2010 , extending over a range in galactocentric radius of @xmath1  135  arcmin ( @xmath1  5170  kpc ) .    the first subset of the new data extended along a narrow track eastwards of m87 s center , in search of any kinematical transition between the bcg and the surrounding cluster .",
    "a peculiar fluctuation in the velocity dispersion profile was indeed found at a radius of @xmath1  9  arcmin ( @xmath1  45  kpc ) , which was the first indication of an inner - halo shell - like feature as we will discuss later .",
    "subsequent data ( the large majority of the total sample ) were obtained at generally random position angles around the galaxy .    in a parallel campaign presented here for the first time ,",
    "we observed intensively the region around the outer stellar `` stream a '' @xcite , at radii of @xmath1  3550  arcmin ( @xmath1  170240  kpc ) .",
    "gc selection for spectroscopic follow - up was obtained from a variety of images as they became available : archival subaru / suprime - cam @xcite @xmath10 imaging , the megacam @xmath11 imaging mentioned above @xcite , and our own new suprime - cam imaging in @xmath12 . given the incomplete spatial coverage of the first two imaging data - sets ,",
    "the third data - set provides our default photometric source for the stream area .",
    "these images were taken on 2009 apr 21 , with intermittent transparency , @xmath1  1@xmath13 seeing , and exposure times of 300 sec in each band .",
    "our spectroscopic follow - up of the stream gcs used keck / deimos and observing and analysis techniques established in our previous work on gc kinematics ( @xcite ; s+11 ) .",
    "four masks were observed during the nights 2009 mar 23 , 2010 mar 1113 , and 2010 jun 12 , with generally good conditions and exposure times varying from 0.5 to 2 hours .",
    "the spectra cover an approximate spectral range of 65009000   at a moderate resolution ( 1.5   fwhm ) that allows the derivation of precise line - of - sight velocities .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard manner , including bias subtraction , flat fielding , wavelength calibration , and sky subtraction , followed by optimal extraction .",
    "heliocentric line - of - sight velocities were derived through cross - correlation with a range of stellar templates , using only the region around the calcium ii triplet ( cat ; h@xmath14 , if available , was used for confirmation of borderline cases ) .",
    "some background galaxies were identified via examination of the extracted spectra and excluded from further analysis .",
    "the velocity uncertainties were estimated by combining in quadrature the statistical uncertainties from the cross - correlation with the systematic uncertainties from using different stellar templates .",
    "the uncertainties for the confirmed gcs ranged from 5 to 18  , with their reliability supported by repeat observations of four gcs and five stars .",
    "the characteristics of the spectroscopically - confirmed gcs ( 20 of them ) , stars , and galaxies in the stream region are provided in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "we also targeted five pn candidates from @xcite but found no h@xmath14 emission in their spectra ( objects 7 - 14 , 7 - 18 , 7 - 51 , 7 - 58 , 7 - 65 ) .",

    "it is an enormous structure spread out over @xmath1  @xmath87  kpc@xmath88 on the sky , and is not identifiable with any previously known photometric feature ( figure  [ fig : main](a ) ) .",
    "the statistical significance of these two substructures will be demonstrated in sections  [ sec : shell ] and [ sec : outer ] , where we also find independent support from their distinct gc metallicity distributions .",
    "both features are most naturally explained as the shredded remnants of infalling galaxies , which we will investigate in section  [ sec : sim ] using numerical simulations . to orient the discussion of the rest of the paper ,",
    "we present illustrative results from these simulations in figure  [ fig : sims ] , which broadly reproduce some of the general features of the data .",
    "here we characterize the properties of the large shell identified in figure  [ fig : main](b ) , and attempt to establish its statistical significance .",
    "we exclude the outer - stream data set from these analyses , thereby focusing on the main part of the data set which has relatively unbiased spatial sampling .    in section  [ sec :",
    "rad ] we compare the use of different conventions for radial distance .",
    "we carry out a group - finding analysis and quantify the entropy in the phase - space data in sections  [ sec : group ] and [ sec : ent ] , and perform maximum - likelihood fitting of simple shell models in section  [ sec : max ] . in section  [ sec : color ]",
    "we analyze the shell gc color distributions , and in section  [ sec : prog ] consider the implications for the shell progenitor .",
    "one of the greatest challenges in detecting and analyzing substructures in extragalactic systems is decoding the multi - dimensional information contained in observations .",
    "the dynamical definition of a substructure is that it occupies a distinct region in some phase - space of physical parameters that are linked to orbital trajectories .",
    "this could be a space defined by the integrals of motion , such as the energy and angular momentum in a spherical gravitational potential , or it could be the six - dimensional observational phase - space of position and velocity .",
    "to pick out a substructure from a background of unrelated structures , it helps to link the observations to orbital solutions .",
    "this can be tricky enough with 6-d data as available for some objects within the milky way , but in distant galaxies , only three dimensions are normally observable ( two of position , one of velocity ) .",
    "this `` projection '' of phase space typically smears out the orbital tracks and can make substructure inferences degenerate .",
    "if one already knew a priori the orbital characteristics of a substructure , one could apply an optimal coordinate transformation to the observations that would maximize the contrast in a `` reduced '' phase - space plot .",
    "one of the most basic reductions to try is converting the two spatial positions to a galactocentric radius , since in the limit of a spherical potential and either a radial or a circular orbit , the particles will outline a characteristic chevron - shaped track in the phase - space of radius and line - of - sight - velocity ( cf .",
    "figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "real galaxies are not perfectly spherical , and in dynamical modeling there is a standard modification to the above transformation that corrects for flattening to first - order .",
    "this is to use an ellipse - based circular - equivalent or `` intermediate - axis '' radius .",
    "if @xmath89 and @xmath90 are projected coordinates along a galaxy s major and minor axes , respectively , then the simple projected radius is : @xmath91 the equivalent radius , given an axis ratio @xmath92 , is : @xmath93 this convention allows one to conserve the area ( and approximately the mass ) enclosed within an elliptical isophote when transforming to a circularized one - dimensional model .",
    "it is also equivalent to recovering a constant radius @xmath94 in three - dimensions for an inclined thin disk .",
    "the next question is what value for @xmath92 to use , as both the flattening of the observable objects and of the unobserved gravitational potential could be important .",
    "unfortunately , in the outskirts of m87 , neither of the flattenings is well constrained ( i.e. , for the gc system or for the potential which is dominated by dark matter ) .",
    "it was found in s+11 ( figure  7 ) that the gc system has a typical @xmath95 at @xmath96  210  ( @xmath1  550  kpc ) , while possibly decreasing with radius . at larger radii ,",
    "the measurement is more difficult , but we have used a maximum - likelihood technique to estimate a possible range of @xmath97  0.550.75 , at @xmath96  1520  ( @xmath1  70100  kpc ) .",
    "our constraints on @xmath98 for the gcs are consistent with the profile for the _ stars _ derived by @xcite , where @xmath92 declines from @xmath99 at @xmath96  1  to @xmath100 outside @xmath96  10 .",
    "we therefore adopt these stellar results for our default model for the gcs , for the sake of having smooth , plausible profiles of @xmath92 and position angle with radius . at @xmath96  20",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with the flattening of the gc system , and it would be inappropriate to use this profile for our analyses .",
    "both the kormendy and the janowiecki profiles agree on a position angle of @xmath101 at large radii , while our gc analysis is more suggestive of @xmath102@xmath103 .",
    "we do not ascribe much credence to this inconsistency , given the difficulties with background contamination and spatial incompleteness at large radii , and given the much better consistency between stars and gcs at small radii . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : radii ] then compares radius - velocity phase - space plots for the m87 gcs , using both the simple and the elliptical radius .",
    "the cold shell at @xmath1  50  kpc appears considerably sharper when using the elliptical radius , and we suspect that it may be easier to find substructures in other data sets if the @xmath104 convention is used .",
    "we will adopt this @xmath104 transformation as our default for the analyses used in the rest of this paper , while issuing some caveats .",
    "one is that it is not entirely clear from a theoretical standpoint why the transformation should work : an accretion event generally defines its own orbital plane that will not necessarily align with the apparent shape of the rest of the galaxy",
    ". it could be that we are seeing an effect related to the disrupted accretor being highly spread out in the host potential .",
    "the other concern from an observational standpoint is that the @xmath98 profile for the gcs is not well determined , and fairly small changes in the radius - transformation ( of @xmath1  1 ) would noticeably affect the inferred morphology of the substructure , causing it to lose some of its apparent sharpness in phase - space .",
    "such `` blurring '' would be expected if there is a genuine cold feature , and if one deviates from an optimal coordinate transformation as discussed above ( we have verified this effect using mock data simulations that we will discuss later ) .",
    "however , we consider it more difficult to artificially _ sharpen _ phase - space features through a transformation error .    in summary , the choice of the radius in the phase - space diagram is a source of systematic uncertainty that is difficult to quantify .",
    "where relevant in our analyses , we will also consider the possibility that the substructure is more amorphous than in our default model ( e.g. , as in figure  [ fig : radii](a ) ) .      to ascertain the veracity of the shell , rather than",
    "rely only on the notoriously misled human eye which is good at creating patterns out of random noise , we examine several different types of models and statistical tests .",
    "this is an aspect that has been underdeveloped in previous work on gc kinematics around early - type galaxies .",
    "our first step is to use a group - finding algorithm , based on a standard friends - of - friends approach ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we define a distance between objects of : @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are radius and velocity scale factors that act inversely as weights .",
    "note that our adopted two - dimensional phase - space metric differs from the three - dimensional @xmath108 metric commonly used , which is suited for very localized substructures that have had little mixing , but we find that it does not work well for structures like shells and long streams that have elongated `` diagonal '' morphologies in phase - space . using the 3-d metric may have caused large - scale substructures to be missed in the past .",
    "a group is defined as a set of objects separated by less than a linking length @xmath109 in phase space , which is in turn defined relative to the mean interparticle spacing @xmath110 by a dimensionless parameter @xmath111 .",
    "we then have the criterion : @xmath112    the next step is to choose the free parameters ( @xmath113 ) in the algorithm , where the objective is to maximize the sensitivity to real features in the data while minimizing the incidence of false groups and linkages . as a starting point",
    ", we construct mock data sets based on simulations of an accretion event ( which we will discuss in detail later ) . to represent the shell , we select @xmath114 particles , a number that is chosen to mimic the real data set , in the sense that the simulation has 27 particles in the same radial region where we find a shell in the real data ( which has an estimated 27 gcs as we will see later ) .",
    "we then fill out the rest of the mock data set by adding 422 gcs drawn from a gaussian velocity distribution with @xmath115  450  , and with positions corresponding to those in the real data set , but randomized by 20% in order to reduce any lingering spatial substructures . throughout this paper ,",
    "we will construct similar , smooth `` background '' gc populations , which would be unrealistic at some level if the halo were rich in substructures of various masses and stages of dissolution . in the future",
    ", one could consider constructing background distributions based on a range of theoretical models for halo accretion histories , but for the purposes of this paper , we focus primarily on the null hypothesis of a halo with _ no _ substructure . a caveat",
    "to then keep in mind is that the large `` shell '' which we recover could in principle consist of two or more distinct substructures that overlap in the observable phase - space and conspire to masquerade as a single structure .",
    "note that the value of @xmath115  450  is larger than the @xmath1  300  of the real data , which is done to be consistent with the simulations circular velocity and larger shell velocity width .",
    "we will later rescale the resulting group - finding parameters to suit the real data .",
    "the exact velocities of the mock data set are also convolved with small errors corresponding to the observational uncertainties in the real data .",
    "we find optimum parameters for the simulated data set of @xmath116  0.035  dex , @xmath117  50  , @xmath118 , with acceptable variations around these values at the @xmath1  20% level .",
    "the group - finding results are shown in figure  [ fig : group2 ] : a group of 70 objects is identified , which reproduces the broad morphology of the shell s limb ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : sims](b ) ) and recovers many of the genuine shell members along with many false associations .",
    "this exercise provides some confidence in the simple group - finding approach for recovering cold phase - space substructures that comprise only @xmath1  10% of a sample .",
    "however , the individual objects assigned to the substructure can include a high degree of contamination .",
    "this fact , combined with the potential sensitivity of the group - finding parameters to the details of the data sampling and of the substructure properties , motivates exploring alternative algorithms ( which we do below ) as well as the future development of more efficient phase - space group - finders .",
    "now after rescaling the foregoing simulation - based parameters , we adopt the following for use with the real data : @xmath116  0.035  dex , @xmath117  30  , @xmath118 . the group - finding algorithm then recovers a shell - like substructure with 68 members , around half of which may be false associations , which we illustrate with figure  [ fig : group](a ) .",
    "given the uncertainty in the radius convention discussed in section  [ sec : rad ] , we also carry out the same procedure while using the simple radius @xmath119 .",
    "we find in this case a group with 80 members , demonstrating that our detection of a large phase - space substructure in m87 is not strongly sensitive to the radius convention .    to further evaluate the statistical significance of this shell , we carry out monte carlo simulations of underlying smooth data sets .",
    "we generate 100 mock gc data sets , using in each case the same radial locations as in the real data , but substituting a random velocity drawn from a gaussian distribution with @xmath120  ( which is the dispersion found in the real data ) .",
    "we then run the group - finding algorithm with the same parameters as for the real data .",
    "the median largest group size found ( outside the crowded central regions where the group - finding parameters are not optimized ) has 30 members , and the largest group of all has 61 members .",
    "examples of these groups are shown in panels ( b ) and ( c ) of figure  [ fig : group ] , alongside the real data in panel ( a ) .",
    "we thus exclude finding a 68-member group by chance at the 99% level .",
    "this test is somewhat conservative in using the radial locations of the real gcs in the mock data sets , which may already have some clumpiness .",
    "if we were to include the data from the outer stream region , a stream - like phase - space feature would indeed be picked up by the group - finding algorithm , but so would be 6 other small `` substructures '' that ( based on the monte carlo simulations above ) are probably not real .",
    "the outer stream is analyzed separately in a later section , using a slightly different algorithm because of the much smaller number counts and the importance of two - dimensional spatial clumping .",
    "the next test uses a very general entropy metric @xmath121 that measures the clumpiness of data in a set of partitions : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the number of objects in each partition @xcite .",
    "we consider the 420  arcmin region of interest and adopt a gridded partition of ( radius by velocity ) with size ( 2  arcmin @xmath124 80  ) .",
    "we measure @xmath121 and compare it to 1000 mock data realizations using gaussian velocity distributions .",
    "we find that this region is significantly substructured at the 1  @xmath125 level .",
    "this is a conservative test because again we have used radii from the real data , and because the rectangular partitioning is not optimized to pick up extended diagonal features as the data appear to show .",
    "we next carry out a set of parametric model fits to the data in the shell region , which both allows us to evaluate the significance of the substructure and to quantify its properties .",
    "we will in general focus on the @xmath126  10.520  arcmin ( 5095  kpc ) region where the shell is most apparent by eye .",
    "the basic idea is that given a model for the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) @xmath127 at a given measurement location @xmath128 , we quantify the likelihood @xmath129 of a velocity measurement @xmath130 : @xmath131 @xcite . the likelihood can be considered as equivalent to a @xmath132 statistic after the operation @xmath133 . for a gaussian model @xmath127 with an intrinsic dispersion @xmath125 centered on a systemic velocity @xmath134 , the maximum likelihood model fitting involves minimizing the simple function : @xmath135\\ ] ] .    before constructing detailed models of the system in phase - space",
    ", we consider the simplest possible models , lumping all of the shell - region velocity data together , with no spatial information .",
    "using the likelihood formalism above , we fit a single gaussian to these data and find a dispersion of 315  .",
    "the implied losvd for this model is shown along with the data in figure  [ fig : losvds](a ) .",
    "it is apparent that a single gaussian is not a good representation of the data , so we next try a double - gaussian model .",
    "we find a best fit where the hot component has a dispersion of @xmath136  , and the cold component comprises a fraction @xmath137 of the gcs , with a dispersion of @xmath138  ( where monte carlo simulated data sets were used to estimate these uncertainties and to correct for slight fitting biases ) .",
    "we show a mock data set of this solution in figure  [ fig : losvds](a ) , to illustrate the level at which noise can influence the losvd .    by eye",
    ", the second gaussian appears required for adequately fitting the data , and to quantify this statement we carry out a monte carlo analysis using a series of single - gaussian mock data sets .",
    "we find that @xmath139 values as high as 0.24 are fitted by chance in only 15 out of 1000 simulations , while most of these false second components are hot , with only 1 out of 1000 having a dispersion as low as @xmath1  80  .",
    "we conclude that there is definitely a secondary cold component , with a dispersion of 120  at the most , comprising 13%37% of the gc data .",
    "it is also important to note that this conclusion does not depend on the detailed morphology of the substructure , and is insensitive to the adopted radius convention ( section  [ sec : rad ] ) , since we have not used radius information except to define the overall radial bin , and the results are also very similar if we define this bin using the circular radius @xmath119 .",
    "next , given the radial dependence of the shell that is visible by eye in figure  [ fig : radii](b ) , we examine the losvd in two radial bins : one at the `` mouth '' of the substructure and one at the `` apex '' ( figure  [ fig : losvds](a , b ) ) .",
    "we again fit double - gaussian models , allowing for a split around @xmath134 for the cold component . in the first bin",
    ", we find a dispersion of @xmath140  with @xmath141 and a peak separation of @xmath142  . in the second ,",
    "we find @xmath143 , and a dispersion consistent with zero with a 68% upper limit of 20  .",
    "these binned results together suggest a cold substructure with @xmath144 and a dispersion of @xmath1  15  .",
    "the latter result is similar to our rms velocity measurement errors , which can be challenging to determine accurately , and consequently a dispersion anywhere in the range 035  is plausible .",
    "we now model all of the shell - region data jointly in phase space .",
    "each model consists of a fraction @xmath139 of substructure , and a gaussian component with fraction @xmath145 ) and dispersion @xmath146 .",
    "the substructure losvd is parametrized in one of three ways : as a single gaussian , a nested double gaussian , or a step function .",
    "these models are all combined with a linear trend of losvd width with radius , producing a tapered gaussian , a chevron , or a filled wedge , respectively .",
    "the characteristic width vs.  radius is : @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the slope and @xmath149 is the apex radius .",
    "the systemic velocity is set as a fixed parameter @xmath150  1307  .",
    "we fit the various model alternatives to the shell region and find @xmath151  0.22 , 0.23 , and 0.26 for the tapered - gaussian , chevron , and wedge models , respectively .",
    "examples of mock data generated from the best model fits are shown in figure  [ fig : phase ] . by eye ,",
    "the real data suggest a feature that is intermediate between the different models , but most closely related to the chevron , owing to the strong `` edge '' seen in the substructure .",
    "more quantitatively , monte carlo modeling of likelihood fits is unfortunately not very informative about which model is the best representation of the substructure .",
    "we find that any of the alternative models can readily fit mock data based on the other models .",
    "instead we turn to a somewhat less parametric representation of the data , using simply a diagonal model ( with a characteristic slope @xmath152  17.3  arcmin@xmath153 ) to project each data point to a velocity at a radius of @xmath154  arcmin .",
    "this exercise allows us to collapse all of the position - velocity phase - space data into single one - dimensional losvds analogous to figure  [ fig : losvds ] , comparing real data to simple models .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : losvds2 ] , where a 30  gaussian smoothing kernel has been applied in order to capture the shape of the distribution while reducing poisson noise . given an apex in all cases of @xmath155  19  arcmin , the model projects to characteristic velocities of @xmath156  160  ( relative to @xmath134 ) at 10  arcmin .",
    "applying the projection to mock data , two peaks are always generated but other properties are more model dependent : the peak widths , locations relative to @xmath157 , and dips in between .",
    "in particular , a chevron model when added to a gaussian produces the most distinct , narrow peaks close to @xmath157 .",
    "we find by inspection of figure  [ fig : losvds2 ] that the real data most closely resemble the chevron - based model , with narrow , well - defined peaks near @xmath157 .",
    "this plot also indicates a two - sided rather than one - sided chevron ( see also figure  [ fig : losvds ] ) .",
    "there is furthermore an additional narrow feature near @xmath158  that appears stronger than a random fluctuation and suggests the presence of another sharp edge in phase - space terminating at @xmath159  30  arcmin ( see also figures  [ fig : radii](b ) and [ fig : losvds ] ) , i.e. , perhaps tracing a second , fainter shell .",
    "although our overall conclusion from losvd analyses is that a chevron is the best representation for the shell , it is difficult to be certain given the available data and the uncertainties in the coordinate transformations to @xmath104 .",
    "the real shell probably has a morphology somewhat intermediate between the idealized models studied here , and also shows hints of being asymmetric with respect to @xmath134 . for now ,",
    "we report the best - fit parameters for the favored chevron model , with uncertainties based on monte carlo simulations : @xmath160 , @xmath161  , @xmath162  arcmin@xmath153 , @xmath163  . of the 119 confirmed gcs in the @xmath126  5095  kpc region , we thus estimate that 2135 of them are in the shell .",
    "we highlight the 27 most likely shell members based on this chevron model in figure  [ fig : main](b ) .",
    "note that the quoted error bars on these fit parameters are the statistical uncertainties _ for an assumed simple chevron model_. the systematic uncertainties from considering alternative models , and from allowing for different radius conventions ( section  [ sec : rad ] ) , are difficult to quantify . above",
    "we reported also a maximal - ignorance model that disregards any spatial tapering of the substructure by fitting a simple double - gaussian , and returns a very conservative upper limit of 120  on the dispersion .",
    "one great advantage of using gcs as phase - space tracers is that they provide additional measurable properties beyond position and velocity . because each gc is to a good approximation comprised of a homogeneous stellar population with a single age and metallicity , the principles of stellar - subpopulation tagging used in the milky way can be extended to more distant systems . in particular ,",
    "gcs are now known to be generally very old objects ( ages of @xmath1  10 gyr ) , both in m87 @xcite and in other galaxies .",
    "therefore their optical colors are dominated by metallicity variations rather than by ages , and we can use _ color _ as a good _",
    "metallicity proxy_.    rather than solely relying on literature findings on this point , we consider the color - metallicity link in our own data set . from the deimos spectra , there are 47 objects with high enough @xmath164 to estimate iron - based metallicities [ fe / h ] via the cat line strengths , using techniques that we have developed earlier with the same instrumental set - up @xcite .",
    "approximate line - strength uncertainties are estimated from the spectroscopic signal - to - noise ratio , after calibration from monte carlo simulated observations of model spectra .",
    "we provide these metallicity estimates in table  [ tab : cat ] , and in figure  [ fig : metals](a ) plot them vs.  dereddened colors for the same gcs where @xmath165 data are available .",
    "we find a strong correlation between metallicity and color that agrees roughly with model predictions @xcite .",
    "understanding the scatter in the data will require more detailed investigation .",

    "again , this supports the color - metallicity link .    despite these arguments that color is a good proxy for metallicity in our data set , it is important to note that our analysis below is independent of this link . whatever the root cause of variations in color , we can still use it as an empirical tagging factor . then for our current purposes the issue is more a matter of semantics : whether we are analyzing chemo - dynamics or chromo - dynamics .",
    "our first basic goal is to use color as a completely independent dimension in the data , to see if it supports the differences among gcs that emerged from the position - velocity phase - space analyses .",
    "we plot velocity versus color in the shell region in figure  [ fig : colors](a ) . in m87 , as in galaxies in general , the population of metal - poor gcs has a more extended distribution from their host galaxy s center than the more metal - rich gcs . given that all of these objects reside in the same gravitational potential , and assuming that they have similar orbital anisotropies , their spatial differences are expected to be related to their velocity dispersions .",
    "the metal - rich gcs should generally have lower dispersions , and figure  [ fig : colors](a ) is expected to show a systematic decrease in dispersion with color , with perhaps a strong transition between the two main subpopulations , at @xmath258  0.9 .    figure  [ fig : colors](a ) does show a kinematic transition with color , but not in the way just described .",
    "there is an overall pattern of a cold component near @xmath134 embedded in a hotter component ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : losvds ] ) , but the cold component does not appear bluewards of @xmath259 .",
    "this color is in the middle of the main blue peak for m87 s gc system , and implies that there is kinematical substructure within this peak .. ] we have looked at the same information using the cat - based metallicities , with consistent results ( colder material at cat  @xmath260    or [ fe / h ] @xmath261  dex ) , but the statistics are too poor to be conclusive ( 17 gcs in the shell region ) .",
    "we next take a different approach , of separating gcs into probable shell and non - shell objects , based on the phase - space maximum likelihood models constructed previously .",
    "we then examine the color distributions of the two subsamples . for each of the models ( tapered gaussian , chevron , wedge ) , the two color distributions are different , with the chevron case shown in figure  [ fig : colors](b ) as an example . here",
    "the shell appears to contain an excess population of intermediate - color gcs , peaking at @xmath262 .    motivated by this result",
    ", we also show the velocity distribution of all the intermediate color objects in the shell region , with @xmath263  0.850.95 , in figure  [ fig : losvds2](a ) .",
    "these objects do show a double - peaked profile as expected in the chevron model , except for an additional low - velocity peak that accounts for much of the candidate outer shell .",
    "we have also fitted the chevron model to the phase - space data for the blue , intermediate - color , and red gcs separately .",
    "the resulting parameters for each of these fits are mutually consistent , and color does not discriminate sharply between shell and non - shell objects , but we do find that the shell fraction is highest in the intermediate - color population , with @xmath264 .",
    "we evaluate the statistical significance of the differences between the chevron and non - chevron color distributions using a kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "we find a @xmath265 value of 0.25 , with a 13% probability of occurrence by chance . according to the test",
    ", the largest difference between the distributions comes at the far blue end , supporting the transition seen in figure  [ fig : colors](a ) .",
    "the same is true for all three shell models , with the far - blue difference being strongest for the tapered - gaussian case , and the intermediate - color peak for the chevron case .",
    "the similarity of the three models also suggests that these conclusions are insensitive to the choice for radius @xmath104 , as is also explicitly the case for the test in figure  [ fig : colors](a ) .",
    "we have found that metallicity information ( primarily using color as a proxy ) provides independent support for the presence of the m87 shell .",
    "the colors do not yet differentiate clearly between the alternative phase - space models for the shell , but even our unprecedented data set only scratches the surface of what can now be accomplished .",
    "it is technically feasible to increase the number of measured gc velocities by an order of magnitude , e.g. , to @xmath1  1500 objects in the shell region alone .",
    "having established the existence of the shell , and some of its properties , we now attempt to identify the nature of its progenitor , assuming that the accretion and disruption of a single galaxy was responsible .",
    "unfortunately , we will see that it is difficult to derive a self - consistent solution from the basic shell parameters , so we will carry out an inventory of different types of constraints to see if an overall solution emerges ( with an estimate of the progenitor s @xmath266-band stellar luminosity , @xmath267 , as a basic goal ) .",
    "since in the previous section we have just discussed the color distribution of the shell gcs , it is natural to try using these colors to constrain the progenitor @xmath267 .",
    "empirically , gc colors correlate with host galaxy luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is conceptually related to the correlations between substructure metallicities and their progenitor masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this framework was used to estimate the relative masses of accreted galaxies in the halo of a nearby s0 in @xcite .    in the case of m87 , we can make use of the correlations found from the `` acsvcs '' large survey of elliptical and lenticular galaxies , both giant and dwarf , in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "although the gc color distributions in these galaxies are in general complex , they show a general tendency for _ bimodality _ , with distinct blue and red peaks . the color - luminosity relation is therefore reported separately for the blue and red gcs . the underlying basis for these correlations is thought to be a mass - metallicity relation , but again , our analysis does not rely on this conclusion .",
    "we have modeled the color distributions of the chevron and non - chevron gcs ( figure  [ fig : colors](b ) ) using kaye s mixture models based on heteroscedastic gaussian color subpopulations @xcite .",
    "we find marginal significance ( @xmath268 ) for bimodality among the chevron gcs , and high significance ( @xmath269 ) for the non - chevron gcs . beginning with the _ non - chevron _",
    "gcs , we find that they have a primary peak at @xmath270  0.77 and a possible weak secondary peak at @xmath258  0.94 , which correspond to @xmath271  0.92 and @xmath1  1.17 , or [ fe / h ]  @xmath1  @xmath272 and @xmath273 , respectively ( where we have made empirical color conversions using a large set of m87 gcs that overlap between acs and cfht imaging ) .",
    "we next assume for simplicity that the gc color peaks in the surviving virgo early - type galaxies are representative of the disrupted progenitors that built up the m87 halo .",
    "considering first the peak locations of the non - chevron gcs and comparing them to the non - parametric peaks determined for the acsvcs galaxies @xcite , we find the former to be fairly atypical when considered jointly ( a puzzle that would be worsened if the chevron gcs were included ) .",
    "this makes the progenitor inference unclear , perhaps owing to the superposition of color peaks from multiple progenitors , but our best guess would be a typical progenitor magnitude of @xmath274 [ @xmath275 .    approximating the @xmath266-band stellar mass - to - light ratios as roughly constant , the implication would be that the accretion events which built up the bulk of the m87 halo had characteristic stellar - mass merger ratios of @xmath1  1:30",
    ". this may be consistent with current ideas of massive galaxies stellar envelopes being assembled through minor mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "this red peak location is very atypical for the acsvcs sample , and may have been inaccurately estimated through our procedure of statistically disentangling the chevron and non - chevron gcs .",
    "we therefore consider the color constraint on the shell progenitor luminosity to be indeterminate .",

    "one might expect to see obvious disturbances and asymmetries in the light distribution of m87 , as well as strong merger - induced halo rotation , which is not observed ( s+11 ) .",

    "such spatial segregation is plausible at some level since the gcs would be expected to inhabit preferentially the outer parts of the incoming galaxy , and thus be stripped off before the stars . note that a fluctuation in the surface density of the gcs themselves would be challenging to detect at the @xmath1  50% level .    as mentioned previously , there are no major signatures of interactions previously known for m87 . some candidates for large - scale , low - surface brightness stellar features have been identified @xcite , but these are at spatially disparate locations from the gc shell , and in some cases are likely to be manifestations of foreground cirrus .    more intriguingly , as mentioned above , there are five low - luminosity ellipticals within a 3080  kpc projected radius of m87 : ngc  4476 , ngc  4478 , ngc  4486a , ngc  4486b , and ic  3443 ( see figures  [ fig : main ] and [ fig : des ] ) . some of these have previously been proposed as the stripped remnants of larger galaxies , based on disturbances in their isophotes or unusual stellar colors for their luminosities . if any of these galaxies is being actively disrupted , some stars and gcs could have already been stripped out and deposited within the halo of m87 .",
    "the first four of these galaxies are in the acsvcs sample , so we consider this scenario in more concrete terms by marking them in figure  [ fig : grid ] with red @xmath124 symbols . here",
    "we see from the top two panels that all four galaxies appear depleted in gcs relative to the average trend , which suggests stripping of their outer regions .",

    "the @xmath288 values of ngc  4486a and ngc  4486b suggest that they originally hosted @xmath1  70200 and @xmath1  100500 gcs , respectively .",
    "their phase - space positions in figure  [ fig : main](b ) , where their velocities are @xmath1  750  and @xmath1  1550  , respectively , indicate that ngc  4486b could be associated with the shell .",

    "this is @xmath1  50100  @xcite , and for ngc  4486b , it is @xmath1  100120   @xcite .",
    "the present - day luminosity of ngc  4478 , @xmath298 , suggests that it may have experienced very little stellar stripping ( figure  [ fig : grid ] , lower - left ) , which would explain the lack of surface brightness variations around m87 . for ngc  4486b",
    ", the implied luminosity at infall of @xmath287  10.1 would require that much of the stellar debris is hidden at small galactocentric radii , which is plausible given that this stripped galaxy is currently at a radius of @xmath1  30  kpc ( note that the missing debris is an issue even without considering the gc shell ) .",
    "both of these galaxies appear to be possible shell progenitors , as their properties are consistent with all of the constraints discussed above , within the uncertainties , except for the low velocity dispersion in the chevron model ( this dispersion could then be considered either as an artifact of the adopted model , or as a product of stripping dynamics that are not yet understood ) .",
    "in fact , the problem could be turned around : given that there are stripped galaxies around m87 which must have lost hundreds of accompanying gcs , should we not expect to see some evidence for them in phase - space ?",
    "the multiplicity of candidate shell progenitors is also a reminder that our initial single - progenitor assumption may be oversimplified .",
    "it is indeed possible that the phase - space of gcs in the m87 halo contains multiple , overlapping , prominent shells and streams",

    ", we examine whether or not our preferred solution , with an accreted luminosity of @xmath287  10 , ( i.e. , @xmath299 , or a @xmath1  1:10 merger ) , represents a likely event in the context of other observational constraints on merger rates in bcgs . as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , the details of bcg assembly are not well known , which motivates our phase - space study , but there are still some plausible upper limits on merger rates .",
    "for example , m87 can not have accreted a galaxy with @xmath287  10 more often than once every @xmath1  1.5  gyr , averaged over a hubble time , or else the total luminosity would be higher than is observed today .",
    "the calculation is more complicated than this because the merger history will be divided over a spectrum of mass ratios , and because the merger rate may change with time .",
    "we therefore turn to the low-@xmath300 bcg survey carried out by @xcite , who found that major mergers ( down to a @xmath1  1:4 mass ratio ) were visible in 1 case out of every 30 .",
    "if we assume for simplicity that mergers are detectable in phase - space for roughly twice as long as in real - space ( which is the only place that merger timescales will enter into our calculations ) , then recent major merger signatures could be found in @xmath1  7% of bcgs .",
    "next , we should like to extrapolate to lower - mass ratios .",
    "the simplest assumption we can make is that the accreted objects follow a standard schechter luminosity function , where 1:4 events correspond to @xmath286 in the case of m87 .",
    "we then calculate that events down to 1:10 should be present in @xmath1  25% of bcgs .",
    "thus it does not seem improbable that the shell in m87 traces a @xmath1  1:10 merger event , while more massive progenitors would begin to stretch the limits of plausibility .",
    "we next analyze the gcs in the northwest area , around `` stream a '' .",
    "figure  [ fig : stream ] summarizes the positional space and phase space properties of this area .",
    "the known stellar stream has a @xmath266-band luminosity of @xmath301 over a @xmath1  15  @xmath124  100  kpc region @xcite .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the spectroscopic observations were tiled closely around the stellar stream , and much of the apparent narrowness in real space of the overall gc distribution is an artifact of this bias .",
    "the fractional return of bona fide gcs from the spectroscopic observations was indeed higher `` on - stream '' than `` off - stream '' , but the statistics here are relatively poor and a more in - depth analysis will be required to consider this question further .",
    "we focus instead on a possible cold phase - space substructure within the spectroscopic sample , where the hotter background may be the stream or the general diffuse outer gc system of m87 .",
    "this tentative substructure consists of 6 gcs ( out of 19 in the sample apart from one associated with a nearby galaxy ) that are clustered in real - space and follow a cold diagonal path in phase space ( drawn schematically in figure  [ fig : stream](b ) ) .",
    "two of these objects are a very close pair , separated spatially by only 2.6  arcsec ( 0.2  kpc ) and in velocity by only 13  , which is consistent with zero within the uncertainties .",
    "to estimate the chances of this substructure being a chance clumping , we pursue friends - of - friends group finding as previously carried out for the shell ( section  [ sec : group ] ) , but reverting to a traditional three - dimensional ( @xmath302 ) phase - space search . in order to pick up the apparent group in the real data ,",

    "we estimate that @xmath305 of the gcs in this region belong to the stream , which has a dispersion of @xmath306  .",
    "this model is intended as a characterization of the stream properties rather than as a robust test of its reality , since the fits are somewhat unstable to the starting conditions .",

    "as with the shell , the color information of the stream provides independent confirmation of its distinctiveness .    as discussed for the shell region , we could in principle connect the peak color of the stream gcs to a possible progenitor , but the statistics are currently too poor for strong constraints .",
    "even so , we can still mention one example of a potential analogue to the stream progenitor : the virgo dwarf elliptical ic  3328 , with a stellar dispersion of @xmath1  35  , hosting @xmath1  40 gcs with a color peak near @xmath308  0.92 , i.e. , @xmath258  0.77 .",

    ", we use a navarro - frenk - white model for the dark matter halo @xcite , and embed a @xcite profile to represent the stellar mass of the central galaxy .",
    "the relevant parameters are reported in table  [ tab : sims ] .",
    "for the inner shell , the main features that we wish to reproduce are the apparent chevron morphology in phase space including a low velocity dispersion , with a high degree of azimuthal mixing in real - space ( see figure  [ fig : main ] ) . for the outer stream , the goal is to find a thin structure in both real and phase - space , which is not closely connected to the progenitor galaxy or nucleus .    for both features ,",
    "we adopt the same low mass galaxy model for the infalling satellite , and consider a modest number of orbital configurations .",
    "the infalling satellite galaxy follows a single - component hernquist model , with characteristic parameters summarized in table  [ tab : sims ] .",
    "a real galaxy will consist of multiple components ( stars , gcs , gas , and dark matter ) , but this introduces additional degrees of freedom to the problem which we are for now keeping as conceptually simple as possible .",
    "we place the satellite on elongated orbits around the potential center ,  100200  kpc may not seem consistent with satellites that fall in from the large - scale environment , but our goal is to set up an idealized model of accretion dynamics once an object has migrated inwards by scattering or dynamical friction ( e.g. , @xcite ) . ] and run the simulations using an @xmath310-body treecode @xcite , which simulates the fully self - gravitating response of the infalling satellite .",
    "the simulations were evolved for several gyr using a fixed timestep of 0.25 myr .",
    "we create real - space and phase - space plots of all the satellite particles for each time - step , using a small selection of viewing angles .",
    "we then select by eye the best combination of timestep and viewing angles that qualitatively resembles the data .",
    "next , we sample a subset of the particles to represent the gc observations , plotting @xmath87 particles to obtain a general sense of the substructure morphology , and an additional subsample of 100 particles for more direct comparison with the data .",
    "our default selection consists of an unbiased , random sample , which can be considered as representing the limiting case where most of the dark halo has been stripped away , with the remaining self - gravitating material traced well by the stars and gcs . in almost every real galaxy ,",
    "the metal - poor gcs occupy a more extended distribution than the field stars , so we have tried the alternative limiting case where the least bound particles are selected as `` gcs '' .",
    "the results from the two sampling schemes turn out to be qualitatively similar .",
    "clearly , our procedures are only the initial steps toward modeling the m87 halo kinematics .",
    "ideally , one would like to : use a live , triaxial potential that includes the effects of dynamical friction and other substructures ; explore a wide range of satellite and orbital parameters ; and use an objective , quantitative metric for optimizing the model fits .",
    "however , our current approach is adequate for providing a broad sense of some of the types of substructure signatures that are physically plausible , which one can see in related analyses of other systems @xcite .",
    "the best qualitative matches that we identified for the shell and the stream ( separately ) were shown in figure  [ fig : sims ] .",
    "the shell progenitor has made a close passage to the center of m87 and was largely disrupted , leaving a classic chevron signature in phase space , while also being spread out in positional space .",
    "the stream progenitor has a larger pericenter and is disrupted more gradually , maintaining integrity as a narrow stream in both phase space and positional space for many orbits .    in a real system",
    ", any triaxiality of the potential would cause the orbits to phase - mix more rapidly , and the time - evolution of the mass distribution would presumably smear out the cold substructures even further ( as well as inhibit any orbital resonances that might in principle be an alternative mechanism for producing cold kinematical features ) .",
    "simulations of cluster - scale tidal streams in a cosmological context @xcite indicate that streams are disrupted over timescales of @xmath1  24 times the local dynamical timescale , @xmath311 . for the shell and stream , @xmath312  0.2 and 0.5  gyr , respectively , so their most likely lifetimes are @xmath1  0.5  gyr and @xmath1  1.5  gyr .",
    "one important feature of coherent substructures is that they trace out a close family of orbits over large scales in galaxy halos , and can thus be used to provide unique constraints on the gravitational potential , including the radial distribution and shape of the dark matter halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the case of a spherical system is conceptually simple : the potential energy lost by particles as they fall in towards the center of the host galaxy is reflected in a monotonic trend of increasing velocities with decreasing radius , modulo projection effects @xcite .",
    "we derive a new formulation of this method , assuming a spherical gravitational field of a power - law form , where the total density , circular velocity , and potential are : @xmath313 @xmath314 @xmath315 where @xmath316 , as is probably appropriate on @xmath1  10100  kpc scales in m87 ( cf . also section  2.2(f ) of @xcite ) . following equation ( 3 ) of @xcite",
    ", we consider a thin shell of radius @xmath317 where particles have zero velocity ( i.e. , they are on radial orbits at apocenter ) . by conservation of energy and by geometry , their line - of - sight velocities at 3-d radius @xmath94 and 2-d radius @xmath318",
    "are then given by @xmath319 .\\ ] ] the velocity `` edge '' of the shell is then determined by solving for the maximum of @xmath320 at a given radius @xmath318 . by fitting this simple model to a cold phase - space feature , we can then estimate the value of @xmath321 near @xmath317 . an even more simplified way to understand",
    "this constraint @xcite is that the slope of the shell velocity edge with radius in phase - space is approximately equal to @xmath322 . in practice ,",
    "the dominant effect is the change of potential energy , so the determination of @xmath321 is fairly insensitive to the form adopted for @xmath323 .",
    "the opening angle of the chevron is smaller than in figure  [ fig : sims](b ) , and in position - space the stream stays highly coherent for many orbits ( in the absence of perturbations in the potential ) .    in figure  [",
    "fig : potent ] we show this model applied to the stream and to two possible shells in m87 , where we have taken the maximum - likelihood linear - slope fits from sections  [ sec : max ] and [ sec : outer ] as starting points for approximate fits in phase - space .",
    "the model reproduces nicely the observed radial trends , and suggests some possible connections in phase - space between the shells and nearby low - luminosity ellipticals .",
    "also shown in the figure are halo pne , which show hints of tracing some of the same substructures seen in the gcs .",
    "more precise orbital fits to the substructures and the potential progenitors will require dedicated dynamical modeling ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    there is a hitch with these model curves : the implied circular velocities differ radically from typical estimates for the m87 potential . at @xmath324  20 , 32 , 41  arcmin ( @xmath1  90 , 150 , 200  kpc ) , we infer @xmath325  270 , 1200 , 1400  , albeit with substantial uncertainties .",
    "previous estimates from dynamical and x - ray analyses yielded @xmath325  650900  over this entire radial range @xcite , while our own equilibrium - based dynamical analysis indicates @xmath325  400550  ( s+11 ) .. we regard the @xmath326  550  model as plausibly describing a massive group - sized dark matter halo around m87 , in which case @xmath327  .",
    "this would indicate a bound - velocity range of @xmath1  5002100  , and probably wider , suggesting that most or all of the objects in figure  [ fig : potent ] are bound to m87 ( modulo the unknown proper - motion velocities ) . ]",
    "these discrepancies should not be a major concern at this point because there are various complications to consider including the radius convention of section  [ sec : rad ] , as well as non - spherical effects @xcite .",
    "in particular , a planar orbit viewed near face - on will show depressed line - of - sight velocities , and a reduced opening angle of the chevron .",
    "an illustration of the latter effect is provided in figure  [ fig : cold ] , which shows an alternative orbit for the shell that has higher angular momentum than our fiducial case , and maintains better planar integrity . here",
    "the `` measured '' @xmath321 would be @xmath1  250  , despite the true value in the model being 635  .",
    "note that the simulation shown is also representative of a large family of orbits that are not a good match to the shell observations because of the high degree of spatial coherence .",
    "as discussed at length in section  [ sec : prog ] , there is an apparent conflict between the shell s inferred kinematical coldness and the large number of gcs , since these imply very different progenitor masses .",
    "we consider this issue more explicitly by changing the simulated shell progenitor to correspond to a more massive galaxy , with parameters summarized in table  [ tab : sims ] .",
    "we show an example post - disruption snapshot in figure  [ fig : sims2 ] , finding as expected that the resulting shell kinematics are hotter than in the dwarf - galaxy simulation , and do not compare as favorably to the observations ( compare figures  [ fig : sims](b ) and [ fig : radii](b ) ) .",
    "however , as previously discussed , this tension is alleviated if we modify our default radius convention and chevron - based model ( compare figure  [ fig : radii](a ) ) .",
    "these simulations bracket the simple cases of very low- and high - mass progenitor galaxies , but a worthwhile endeavor for the future would be simulating more detailed intermediate - mass cases , including bulge , disk , stellar halo , and dark matter halo subcomponents .",
    "an additional aspect that could be pursued is the modeling of velocity gradients with azimuthal angle , which should be generically found in tidal features ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our initial look at the m87 shell data shows no clear sign of such effects .",
    "we have used an unprecedentedly wide - field data set of high - precision globular cluster velocities to search for phase - space substructure around the central cluster galaxy m87 .",
    "the large majority of the data are from s+11 , with a few additional velocities obtained from the literature , and from a new sample of keck / deimos spectroscopy presented here that targets a known filament of stellar light in the outer halo",
    ". analysis of ( @xmath328 ) colors and spectroscopic metallicities for a subset of our gc sample confirms that the colors provide a good proxy for metallicity , allowing for chemical tagging of substructures .",
    "we identify two candidate features : one a small stream near to the outer - halo stellar filament , and the other a previously unknown colossal `` shell '' in the inner halo .",
    "we have carried out extensive statistical tests and characterizations of these substructures .",
    "the outer gc stream appears to be a collection of @xmath329 objects ( after extrapolating to fainter magnitudes ) residing in a @xmath1  5  @xmath124  20  kpc clump with an internal velocity dispersion of @xmath330  .",
    "we have found the presence of this stream to be significant both in a group - finding analysis @xmath331 , from a maximum likelihood model @xmath332 , and from its distinctive color distribution compared to the surrounding gcs @xmath333 .    the stream dispersion",
    ", its gc colors and numbers counts , the color of the stellar filament , and the filament s narrowness all suggest the accretion of a dwarf galaxy .",
    "low - mass kinematical substructures in elliptical galaxies have been inferred in other studies @xcite , but in this case the association with a visible counterpart should allow for a much clearer determination of the accretion dynamics .",
    "the shell of gcs has a chevron - like shape in phase - space that resembles classic expectations for a disrupted infalling system @xcite , although the interpretation in detail is more challenging .",
    "the appearance of the shell is sharpened by a change of coordinates from simple radius to elliptical , circular - equivalent radius .",
    "the significance of the shell in phase - space is established using a group - finding algorithm ( @xmath334 ) , a crude entropy metric ( @xmath335 ) , and a maximum - likelihood chevron - based model ( @xmath334 compared to a pure gaussian model ) .",
    "the color distribution of the shell and non - shell gcs from the same region is different @xmath336 , providing independent evidence for the existence of the shell .",
    "the phase - space morphology resembles a simple chevron model more than a wedge or tapered gaussian , but may very well have a complex , intermediate morphology ; however , such uncertainties do not compromise our basic finding of a relatively massive and cold substructure .",
    "we find from maximum - likelihood fitting that the shell contains 5001100 gcs , which is @xmath1  5 times the entire milky way system , and comprises around 20% of m87 s gcs in the 5095  kpc region .",
    "this number suggests a stellar debris field of ( 26)@xmath337 , brought in by either a large group of dwarf galaxies , or by a single giant elliptical or lenticular galaxy .",
    "the dramatic appearance of the shell in phase - space is due to its relatively cold kinematics , with an estimated velocity dispersion of 1030   ( or up to @xmath1  120  if we make generous allowances for uncertainties concerning the shell morphology ) .",
    "the lower velocity dispersion estimates are difficult to reconcile with the number of inferred gcs , as they most naturally imply a dwarf galaxy hosting only a handful of gcs .",
    "however , after allowing for systematic uncertainties in our analyses , we suggest a solution involving an e / s0 progenitor with a luminosity of @xmath299 , which could very well also be the parent galaxy for one of the tidally - stripped galaxies now visible close in to m87 .    there is a critical need for additional data from the shell region , including new velocities of both gcs and pne , in order to confirm the presence of the substructure and to refine our estimates of its characteristics . along these lines , we have recently obtained another cycle of gc spectroscopy from mmt / hectospec that includes @xmath1  35 velocity measurements of independent objects in the shell region .",
    "a preliminary analysis yields no obvious sign of substructure , but the statistics from the new data are poor , and at least another @xmath1  100 velocities are needed .    we have carried out simplified @xmath310-body simulations of satellite galaxy accretion in a static cluster@xmath338bcg potential , finding that these readily produce streams and chevrons in phase space . in one simulation , a dwarf galaxy has recently fallen in and is partially disrupted , forming a classic , narrow tidal stream in both positional and phase space . in a second case ,",
    "the initial infall orbit had much lower angular momentum , so that the satellite galaxy passed close to the center of m87 and was quickly disrupted .",
    "its remnants are strewn more haphazardly across positional space and could be difficult to discern against the main body of m87 , while a distinct chevron persists in phase space , with the apex corresponding to a shell turning point .",
    "these simulations compare favorably to the m87 observations because the low internal velocity dispersions of the dwarf progenitors result in cold kinematics for the tidal debris .",
    "simulations of a more massive progenitor produce hotter kinematics that do not as strongly resemble the data for the `` shell '' , reiterating the tension between the different constraints on the shell progenitor mass , which remains unresolved pending further observations and modeling .",
    "it would be worth also investigating alternative explanations for the substructure , such as a shell - like boundary between well - mixed gc subpopulations formed or accreted in different epochs .",
    "we have explored the use of the velocity - radius slopes of the substructures in phase - space estimate the underlying gravitational potential and dark matter distribution around m87 .",
    "however , the interpretation of the data appears to be complicated by non - spherical effects .",
    "taken at face value , the shell gcs imply a substantial , recent accretion event in the halo of m87 .",
    "this is the first large substructure identified around a central cluster galaxy , the first large stellar substructure with a clear kinematical detection in _ any _ type of galaxy beyond the local group , and by far the largest shell or stream discovered in the local universe .",
    "m87 was a favored target for our survey as well as previous ones because of its proximity , rich gc system , and _ general lack of obvious dynamical disturbance_. the large shell we have discovered is an example of the lurking accretion signatures that could be found from detailed phase - space studies of apparently placid galaxies .",
    "there are however more indirect lines of evidence for a recent minor merger in m87 , such as an off - center supermassive black hole @xcite , a lopsided central gc velocity distribution ( s+11 ) , an accretion powered jet , and several surrounding peculiar low - luminosity satellites that could be the nuclei of since - shredded disk galaxies .",
    "further theoretical work is needed to see if these features could all be explained by a unified scenario involving a recent gas - rich minor merger .",
    "the shell and stream in m87 have probable lifetimes of @xmath1  0.5  gyr and @xmath1  1.5  gyr , respectively . given our best guesses for the progenitors of these features , the total luminosity of m87 would be built up by @xmath1  10 or @xmath1  1000 events corresponding to the shell or the stream , respectively . if these recent events are representative of the long - term evolution of m87 , and by extension of the class of brightest cluster galaxies in general , then they support a picture of late - epoch growth by hierarchical assembly @xcite .    more generally , the m87 results are another demonstration of the potency of gcs for providing unique information about the stellar halos of galaxies .",
    "we note the concluding prediction of @xcite for their landmark two - phase galaxy formation scenario : `` ... the outer parts of massive giant ellipticals will tend to be old , blue , metal - poor , and relatively uniform from galaxy to galaxy since they are all composed essentially of the debris from tidally destroyed accreted small systems . ''",

    "<S> the halos of galaxies preserve unique records of their formation histories . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out the first combined observational and theoretical study of phase - space halo substructure in an early - type galaxy : m87 , the central galaxy in the virgo cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze an unprecedented wide - field , high - precision photometric and spectroscopic data set for 488 globular clusters ( gcs ) , which includes new , large - radius subaru / suprime - cam and keck / deimos observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find signatures of two substructures in position - velocity phase - space . </S>",
    "<S> one is a small , cold stream associated with a known stellar filament in the outer halo ; the other is a large shell - like pattern in the inner halo that implies a massive , hitherto unrecognized accretion event . we perform extensive statistical tests and independent metallicity analyses to verify the presence and characterize the properties of these features , and to provide more general methodologies for future extragalactic studies of phase - space substructure . </S>",
    "<S> the cold outer stream is consistent with a dwarf galaxy accretion event , while for the inner shell there is tension between a low progenitor mass implied by the cold velocity dispersion , and a high mass from the large number of gcs , which might be resolved by a @xmath0 e / s0 progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> we also carry out proof - of - principle numerical simulations of the accretion of smaller galaxies in an m87-like gravitational potential . </S>",
    "<S> these produce analogous features to the observed substructures , which should have observable lifetimes of @xmath1  1  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the shell and stream gcs together support a scenario where the extended stellar envelope of m87 has been built up by a steady rain of material that continues until the present day . </S>",
    "<S> this phase - space method demonstrates unique potential for detailed tests of galaxy formation beyond the local group . </S>"
