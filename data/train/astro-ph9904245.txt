    "a large number of cosmological probes now suggest that the universe is spatially flat with a low mass density ( e.g. , perlmutter et al . 1998 ; riess et al . 1998 ; lineweaver 1998 ; guerra & daly 1998 ; bahcall & fan 1998 ) .",
    "in addition to the mass density , gravitational lensing statistics have allowed limits to be placed on the cosmological constant .",
    "however , current limits on the cosmological constant from gravitational lensing arguments are only based on lensing statistics due to foreground galaxies ( e.g. , kochanek 1996 ; falco , kochanek , munoz 1998 ; cheng & krauss 1999 ; cooray , quashnock , miller 1999 ; cooray 1999a ; quast & helbig 1999 ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to consider lensing statistics due to foreground galaxy clusters ( e.g. , wu & hammer 1993 ; bartelmann et al .",
    "1998 ; cooray 1999b ) .",
    "it is well known that galaxy cluster evolution is strongly sensitive to the cosmological mass density of the universe ( e.g. , bahcall & fan 1998 ; viana & liddle 1998 ) .",
    "since lensing statistics are sensitive to the cosmological constant , it is likely that the number of lensed arcs due to galaxy clusters can provide strong constraints on both the mass density and the cosmological constant .    since the first suggestion that lensed optical arcs can be used as a cosmological probe ( wu & hammer 1993 ) , several studies have addressed specific issues related to the statistical calculation .",
    "these include the effect of a cosmological constant ( wu & mao 1996 ) and background source evolution ( hamana & futamase 1997 ) .",
    "the numerical works by bartelmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , using simulated clusters in three cosmological models , suggested that current observational statistics on lensed arcs are consistent with predictions in an open universe ( @xmath3 ) with @xmath4 . in cooray",
    "( 1999b ; hereafter c99 ) , we extended the predictions to general cosmologies and also predicted the existence of lensed radio and sub - mm towards foreground clusters . here , we extend the calculation in c99 by including various uncertainties in the predicted number of lensed optical sources to study the possibility of obtaining limits on cosmological parameters based on the observed number .    in   2 ,",
    "we describe our calculation and inputs for the prediction . in   3 , we compare the predicted number of lensed arcs to the observed number and use a reliable lower limit on the observed number to derive an upper limit on the cosmological mass density of the universe . we follow the conventions that the hubble constant , @xmath5 , is 100@xmath6  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , the present matter energy density in units of the closure density is @xmath8 , and the normalized cosmological constant is @xmath9 . unless otherwise noted , quoted errors are 1-@xmath10 statistical errors .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe our calculation and especially the description of foreground lensing clusters (   2.1 ) and background sources (   2.2 ) .",
    "we also introduce a nonsingular isothermal sphere model to describe galaxy cluster dark matter profile , which is primarily motivated by recent determinations of the cluster potentials using high performance numerical inversions of combined strong and weak lensing data towards a sample of galaxy clusters .      the differential probability that a beam towards a background source will encounter a foreground lens with a path length of @xmath11",
    "is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number density of foreground lenses at redshift @xmath14 while @xmath15 is the lensing cross section ( e.g. , fukugita et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "using the press - schechter mass function ( press & schechter 1974 ; ps ) , the comoving number density of galaxy clusters , @xmath16 , at redshift @xmath17 and mass @xmath18 , can be written as @xmath19}\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the comoving background matter density , @xmath21 is the variance of the fluctuation spectrum averaged over a mass scale @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the linear overdensity of a perturbation which has collapsed and virialized . taking an approach similar to the one presented in viana & liddle ( 1998 ) , @xmath24 is written as a function of the comoving radius , @xmath25 , which contains mass @xmath22 at the current epoch : @xmath26 where @xmath27 \\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath28 ( peacock & dodds 1994 ) is the cdm shape parameter ; our results are insensitive to its specific value ( e.g. , viana & liddle 1998 ) . in order to calculate growth evolution as a function of redshift in various cosmologies",
    ", we write @xmath29 as : @xmath30 where , following carroll , press & turner ( 1992 ) , the growth suppression factor is : @xmath31^{-1 } \\ , .\\ ] ]    the normalization for @xmath32 comes from the local temperature function ( pen 1998 ) : @xmath33    in order to model the cluster lensing potential , we use the nonsingular singular isothermal sphere model with the observed velocity dispersion and an a priori determined value for the core radius of the dark matter potential of the cluster .",
    "the evidence for a core radius in the dark matter profile of galaxy clusters primarily comes from the existence of gravitationally lensed arcs in the radial direction from the cluster center . for simple models for the cluster potential involving singular isothermal models ,",
    "such arcs are located at a distance equivalent to the core radius of the cluster pontential profile . also , recent numerical inversions of galaxy cluster lensing potentials using hubble space telescope and other ground based high quality images clearly suggest the presence of a small core radius ( tyson , kochanski , dellantonio 1998 ; ian dellantonio , private communication ) .",
    "thus , it is necessary that we consider a lensing model which allows for the possible presence of a core radius .",
    "following hinshaw & krauss ( 1987 ) , we consider a isothermal sphere model with a core radius and write the density profile as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the dark matter velocity dispersion and @xmath36 is the core radius of the dark matter profile of the cluster .",
    "the conventional singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) is recovered when @xmath36 is zero .",
    "the lensing cross section for the nonsingular isothermal model is given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are observer to lens , observer to source and lens to source distances .",
    "these distances are calculated under the filled beam approximation . in eq .",
    "9 , @xmath41 is a correction factor that takes into account the nonsingular behavior of the density profile ( see , hinshaw & krauss 1987 ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the ratio of core radius to critical radius of the lensing potential , with the latter measured at the redshift of the cluster : @xmath44 when the sis model is considered , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for small core radii , especially for the present case involving galaxy clusters",
    ", one can usually ignore higher order @xmath43 terms associated with @xmath41 ; we consider , however , the full formula in deriving cosmological parameters .",
    "finally , the differential optical depth for the nonsingular isothermal model is : @xmath47 ^ 4 \\frac{dn(m',z_l)}{dm'}\\ , f(\\beta ) dm'\\right )   \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\times   ( 1+z_l)^3 \\left ( \\frac{d_{ol}d_{ls}}{d_{os}}\\right)^2 \\frac{cdt}{dz_l}dz_l,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total optical depth to a given background redshift , @xmath48 , is given by : @xmath49    in order to calculate the lensing optical depth , we take a two step approach to relate cluster velocity dispersion to its mass .",
    "we relate velocity dispersion to cluster temperature using recently updated @xmath50 relation ( wu et al .",
    "1998 ) : @xmath51 and then to mass using partly theoretical @xmath52 relation ( e.g. , barbosa et al .",
    "1996 ) : @xmath53^{\\frac{1}{3 } }   \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   \\times \\left(\\frac{m}{10^{15}h^{-1 } m_{\\sun}}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}}(1+z).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have allowed for an extra uncertainty in the @xmath52 relation by comparing various normalizations that have been suggested in the literature . also , we note that @xmath43 is dependent on cluster mass through velocity dispersion ( eq .  11 ) .",
    "in addition to velocity dispersion , it is likely that cluster core radii are also dependent on individual cluster masses .",
    "even though such variations have been observationally determined for galaxies ( e.g. , lauer 1985 ) , there is still no observational evidence for a dependence of galaxy cluster core radii with other physical properties , such as the x - ray luminosity or temperature . for the purpose of this calculation ,",
    "we take a constant value for the core radius based on the mean value of cluster core radii from numerical inversions ( @xmath0 35 h@xmath7 kpc ; dellantonio private communication ) .",
    "when deriving cosmological parameters , we vary the exact value of the core radius to investigate the parameter dependences on it ; as we find later , our limits on @xmath2 is weakly dependent on the core radius .    fig .  1 .  optical depth for strong lensing for a background source at redshift of 1 , due to foreground massive clusters .",
    "shown are the 95% confidence ranges for both flat ( _ dot - dashed lines _ ) and open ( _ solid lines _ ) cosmologies with and without a cosmological constant .",
    "given the large uncertainty associated with the optical depth and the small difference between flat and open cosmological models , it is unlikely that lensed arc statistics can be used to reliably place limits on the cosmological constant .    in fig .  1",
    ", as an illustration , we show the optical depth to lensing due to foreground clusters with total masses greater than @xmath54 for a background source at a redshift of 1 , as a function of @xmath2 for open and flat cosmologies , and considering a lensing potential in which @xmath46 ( sis model ) .",
    "shown are the 95% upper and lower confidences in each case by considering all possible errors we have so far considered . the uncertainty in the optical depth is primarily dominated by the error associated with the normalization of the ps mass function ; since the number density of massive clusters is strongly sensitive to the exponential term in eq .",
    "2 , small changes in @xmath32 can produce order of magnitude changes in the number density .",
    "the difference between flat and open cosmological models is primarily due to the increase in lensing probability with the addition of @xmath9 .",
    "however , this difference is small , and when errors in observations are also considered , it is impossible to study the possible existence of a cosmological constant using lensed arc statistics",
    ". therefore , taking a conservative approach , we combine the upper curve valid for flat cosmologies with the lower curve defined by open models to combine the 95% confidence range in the predicted number of lensed sources .      in order to obtain reliable predictions on the number of lensed arcs ,",
    "it is important that both the background source evolution and effects such as `` magnification bias '' ( kochanek 1991 ) be included in the calculation .",
    "our description of background sources comes from the hubble deep field ( hdf ; williams et al .",
    "we use the hdf redshift and magnitude distribution and the luminosity function from sawicki et al .",
    "such an approach allows us to reliably account for the true redshift distribution of background sources , instead of an empirical distribution or a constant redshift , while also accounting for intrinsic evolutionary effects which has shown to be important for lensing predictions ( e.g. , hamana & futamase 1997 )    using the probability , @xmath55 , for a source at redshift @xmath17 to be strongly lensed and the number of unlensed background sources between rest - frame luminosity @xmath56 and @xmath57 and between redshifts @xmath17 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , we can write the number of lensed galaxies , @xmath60 , in that luminosity and redshift interval as ( see , also maoz et al .",
    "1992 ) : @xmath61f(a , l , z)q(a)\\,da \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the integral is over all allowed values of @xmath62 , the amplification of the brightest lensed image , @xmath63 is the probability distribution of amplifications , and @xmath64 is the probability of observing the brightest image given @xmath62 , @xmath56 , and @xmath17 .",
    "our assumption that the lenses are nonsingular isothermal spheres implies that the minimum amplification , @xmath65 , is a function of @xmath43 .",
    "in general , the probability distribution of amplifications can be written as : @xmath66    fig .",
    "minimum amplification versus @xmath43 , the ratio of core radius to critical radius at the redshift of the lensing cluster .    in fig .  2",
    ", we show @xmath67 as a function of @xmath43 , which is calculated following cheng & krauss ( 1999 ) . in practice",
    "we use a fitting function that returns @xmath67 for a given value of @xmath43 , with an accuracy of better than 0.1% at all interested values of @xmath43 in the present calculation . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath64 is a step function , @xmath68 $ ] , so that a lensed image with apparent magnitude brighter than @xmath69 is detected . for a given value of the core radius and the velocity dispersion , @xmath43 is determined from eq .  11 . for massive clusters discussed here with velocity dispersions of the order @xmath70 1000 km s@xmath7 and at redshifts @xmath0 0.2 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "compared to the sis model , the addition of a small core radius only produces slight changes in the lensing probability .",
    "as described in kochanek ( 1995 ) , the effect of a core radius is to increase the magnification bias while increasing the effective lensing cross section ; the overall effect is that the presence of a core radius is not significantly different from that of a sis model .",
    "we assume that the brightness distribution of background galaxies at any given redshift is described by a schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) , in which the comoving density of galaxies at redshift @xmath17 and with luminosity between @xmath56 and @xmath57 is @xmath73^{\\alpha(z ) } e^{-l / l^*(z)}\\ , dl\\ ; , \\ ] ] where , as before , both @xmath56 and @xmath74 are measured in the rest frame of the galaxy .",
    "following cqm , we can write the expected number @xmath75 of lensed sources as @xmath76 { 2\\over{(a-1)^3}}da\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over each of the background galaxies . the index @xmath77 represents each galaxy ; hence , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are , respectively , the redshift , rest - frame luminosity , and apparent magnitude of the @xmath77th galaxy .",
    "since @xmath79 for individual galaxy is unknown , due to uncertain k - corrections , following cooray , quashnock & miller ( 1999 ) , we estimate the total average bias by weighting the integral in eq .  19 by a normalized distribution of luminosities @xmath79 drawn from the schechter function appropriate for the redshift @xmath78 of galaxy @xmath77 .",
    "we calculated the magnification bias for individual redshift intervals for which the schechter function parameters are available in table 1 of sawicki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in principle",
    ", the uncertainties in the schechter function parameters at a given redshift can affect the calculation of the bias , but in practice only the uncertainty in the power - law slope @xmath81 has a significant effect .",
    "the effect of varying @xmath81 on the lensing statistics was discussed in cooray , quashnock & miller ( 1999 ) for lensing statistics involving foreground galaxies in the hubble deep field , which is also valid for the present case involving galaxy clusters ; the general effect due to uncertainties tabulated in sawicki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is that the constraints on cosmological parameters vary by less than 5% percent , when @xmath81 is in general varied by the quoted 1-@xmath10 uncertainties in sawicki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . here",
    ", we take a conservative approach and allow the largest possible bias , so that the expected number is overestimated by an amount as suggested above .",
    "the only effect of this approach is to slightly increase our upper limit on @xmath2 .",
    "3 .  expected number of lensed arcs on the whole sky with amplifications greater than 10 and v - band magnitudes brighter than 22 towards foreground massive clusters .",
    "the shaded range shows the 95% confidence upper and lower limits on the expected number of lensed arcs , while the horizontal lines show the range of current observed numbers .",
    "we use the lower limit on the current observed number to impose an upper limit on @xmath2 .    in figure  3 , we show the expected number of lensed arcs towards foreground massive clusters with total mass greater than @xmath82 , and assuming a zero core radius for the lensing potential .",
    "we define an arc as a lensed source which is amplified by a factor equal to or greater than 10 .",
    "to make a direct comparison to both observations and prior predictions , we impose a limiting v - band magnitude of 22 . our numbers can be directly compared to previous estimates , especially those of bartelmann et al .",
    "this study predicted @xmath0 2400 arcs in an open universe with @xmath4 and @xmath0 36 arcs in an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "the number expected in a flat universe with @xmath4 and @xmath83 was @xmath0 280 .",
    "our estimates for for an einstein - de sitter universe range from @xmath0 0.1 to 60 while for @xmath4 universe ( independent of @xmath9 ) is @xmath0 50 to 7000 ( with the higher end allowed by the cosmological constant ) .",
    "the primary reason for a lower number of arcs with @xmath9 in the study by bartelmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) was their assumption that clusters are different in universes with a cosmological constant , such that their concentration is lower .",
    "based on numerical simulations performed by the virgo consortium , however , thomas et al .",
    "( 1998 ) studied a series of clusters in four different cosmologies , including an open model with @xmath84 and a flat model with a cosmological constant of @xmath85 .",
    "the authors concluded that clusters do not exhibit differences between open and flat cosmologies with and without a cosmological constant and that cluster structures can not be used to discriminate between the two possibilities . if thomas et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are correct , then the inclusion of a cosmological constant is not expected to change cluster mass profiles to an extent that would affect the gravitational lensing rate . in any case , such systematic effects are unlikely to be nearly as large as the current uncertainty in @xmath32 which dominates the present calculation on the lensing rate . ignoring this case ,",
    "our predictions are generally consistent with bartelmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . as we have demonstrated in fig .  1 ,",
    "lensed arc statistics are unlikely to provide useful limits on the cosmological constant .",
    "the same is true for alternatives to the cosmological constant , such as scalar field and quintessence models that have recently been introduced ( e.g. , steinhardt et al . 1998 ) .",
    "in order to derive a limit on @xmath2 based on the number of lensed arcs , we require knowledge on the observed number of such lensing events . current surveys of clusters are based on their x - ray luminosities rather than masses . for an example , the luminosity cutoff of the followup einstein medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) cluster arc survey by le fvre et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is @xmath86 , measured in the emss band of 0.3 to 3.5 kev . converting this to a total mass by following through a recently derived @xmath87 relation ( arnaud & evrard 1998 ) in addition to the above @xmath52 relation suggest a reliable lower limit on the mass of @xmath88 .",
    "we have taken the lowest limit on mass by considering all cosmologies  since the @xmath52 relation and @xmath56 estimates are different under varying cosmologies .",
    "the current observed arc statistics ( e.g. , le fvre et al . 1994 ; luppino et al .",
    "1998 ) , when converted to a whole sky number , suggest that the number of arcs towards above defined massive clusters and with amplifications greater than 10 down to a v - band limiting magnitude of 22 is between 1500 and 2500 ( e.g. , c99 ; bartelmann et al .",
    "1998 ) . ignoring the upper value , which is likely to be unreliable",
    ", we use the lower estimate to derive an upper limit on @xmath2 .",
    "since the lower estimate is based on the observed number , this allows us to put a reliable upper limit on @xmath2 .",
    "we also vary this lower limit to study its effects on our constraints .    in order to derive a constraint on @xmath2",
    ", we adopt a bayesian approach , and take a uniform prior for @xmath2 between 0 and + 1 .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that we do not yet have a precise determination of @xmath2 , and , based on various theoretical arguments , we do not wish to consider cosmologies in which either this quantity lies outside the interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "since the prior for @xmath2 is uniform , the posterior probability density is simply proportional to the likelihood .    the likelihood @xmath89  a function of @xmath2",
    " is the probability of the data , given @xmath2 .",
    "the likelihood for @xmath90 observed arcs ( at redshifts @xmath91 ) when @xmath75 is expected is given by ( cooray , quashnock & miller 1999 ) : @xmath92\\right ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] we have taken into account the uncertainty in predicted lensing rate by introducing @xmath93 , which is the fractional 1-@xmath10 error on @xmath94 and then mariginalizing the likelihood over the variance of it . in order to constrain @xmath2",
    ", we also need the redshifts @xmath91 of the observed arcs . using published data on individual lensing clusters , we obtained a median redshift for the lensed arcs of @xmath95 . as we find below , changing this mean redshift to a reasonably different value does not change our constraints on the @xmath2 greatly .    when the observed lower limit is compared with predictions",
    ", we find that @xmath96 at the 95% confidence when there is no core radius ( sis ) .",
    "when we include a core radius of 35 h@xmath7 kpc , the upper limit on @xmath2 decreases to 0.56 at the 95% confidence level ; the change in the upper limit on @xmath2 is only a minor effect .",
    "if the core radius were to be as large as 100 h@xmath7 kpc , then the derived upper limit on @xmath2 can be as low as 0.29 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "however , such a large core radius for the cluster dark matter profile is ruled out leaving the possibility only for a much smaller core radius of the order 30 to 40 h@xmath7 kpc . when the effective median redshift of lensed arcs are changed to a lower number as @xmath0 1 , the upper limit increases to 0.58 from 0.56 , while when the redshift is increases to a value of 3.0 from 1.6 , the upper limit on @xmath2 at the 95% confidence decreases to 0.52 .",
    "when we increase the lower limit from 1500 to 2000 , our upper limit on @xmath2 with a model involving core radius of 35 h@xmath7 kpc , decreases to 0.52 from 0.56 .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the expected number of lensing events varies by orders of magnitude when @xmath2 is changed from 1 to 0 , with the variation in the expected number larger at the lower end of @xmath2 values .",
    "for such a small core radius , the limit on @xmath2 is consistent with current estimates based on other cosmological probes such as type ia supernovae and galaxy cluster abundances .",
    "we note that our limit on @xmath2 does not mean that the universe is open without a cosmological constant , but rather lensed arc statistics are not sensitive enough to the cosmological constant to see its effects above the current uncertainties . in general , the upper limit on @xmath2 with a cosmological constant is slightly higher when compared to an open model . however , this difference is rather small ( @xmath0 few percent , see fig .  1 ) , and can not be distinguished using current observations on cluster number counts and lensed arcs .      using a lower limit on the observed number of lensed arcs",
    ", we have derived an upper limit on @xmath2 .",
    "a major uncertainty is likely to come when estimating a lower limit on the observed number of arcs since it is only based on optical followup observations of emss clusters ( e.g. , henry et al . 1992 ) . as a reliable approach ,",
    "we have taken the lower limit allowed by the observed number of lensed arcs towards this sample .",
    "in reality , the true number is likely to be higher but the lower limit allows us to safely consider upper limits on cosmological parameters , especially the cosmological mass density .",

    "several attempts are currently underway ( e.g. , luppino et al .",

    "it is likely that the optical followup observations of additional cluster catalogs , such as the rosat bright cluster survey ( bcs ; ebeling et al .",
    "1998 ) , can greatly improve our knowledge on the lensing statistics due to galaxy clusters allowing better constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition to current low number statistics , other uncertainties are likely to come from the conversion of observations , such as cluster x - ray luminosity , to mass . however , at each step , we have considered various estimates such that the predicted number of lensed arcs is overestimated ; this approach allows us to consider a reliable limit on @xmath2 , whose upper limit may have been systematically increased by our procedure .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of a core radius on arc statistics . as found , for luminous optical arcs with amplifications greater than 10",
    ", the effect of a core radius on our prediction on the number of lensing events is minimal .",
    "the upper limit only varies from 0.62 to 0.56 at the 95% confidence when a reasonable core radius of size 35 h@xmath7 kpc is introduced . increasing the core radius as high as 100 h@xmath7 kpc reduces the upper limit by a factor of @xmath0 2 ,",
    "however , such a large core radius is ruled out by current observations of gravitational lensing of clusters ( e.g. , the nonexistence of radial arcs at large distances from the cluster center ) .",
