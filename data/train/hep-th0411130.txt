    "there has been a flourish of recent work concerned with time dependence in string theory ( see , for example @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , where we have a @xmath0-brane probing the backgrounds of various supergravity solutions . whilst some of this work has focused on @xmath1-brane backgrounds ( @xcite , @xcite ) ,",
    "much of it has dealt with @xmath25-branes .",
    "this has been particularly fruitful since it is known that the instability of the probe brane can be explained using tachyon rolling @xcite , and has also emphasised the relationship betweeen bps and non - bps branes @xcite , @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", the dynamics of a @xmath1-brane in the background of @xmath3 coincident @xmath4-branes was considered using the dbi action .",
    "the @xmath1-brane is effectively a probe , since it can explore the background without disturbing it .",
    "this is because the fivebrane tension goes as @xmath5 , whilst the @xmath1-brane tension only goes as @xmath6 .",
    "thus the @xmath25-branes are much heavier in the @xmath7 limit .",
    "geometrically this implies that the fivebranes form an infinite throat in spacetime where the string coupling increases as we move closer to the bottom .",
    "since the @xmath1-brane and the @xmath4-brane preserve different halves of the type ii supersymmetry , this configuration is unstable despite the fact that the @xmath1-brane is bps .",
    "this means that the probe brane will be gravitationally attracted towards the sources .",
    "the ramond - ramond charge of the @xmath0-brane is free to leak to the fivebranes during the motion , and we also find that the energy due to string emission is divergent for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the classical analysis is vaild only for larger dimension branes .",
    "as the brane loses almost all of its energy it can form a bound state with the fivebranes , becoming a @xmath9 fivebrane - a member of the @xmath10 fivebrane multiplet .",
    "the issue of stable trajectories was also discussed in @xcite , but it was found that the probe brane was either scattered or doomed to fall towards the @xmath25-branes .",
    "however this was of interest since the infalling @xmath1-brane would probe the strong coupling region , where pertubation theory would be expected to fail .",
    "it was argued that there was a range of energies for which pertubation theory was still reliable as the probe passed through the thoat .    in this note",
    "we would like to examine a similar situation , however rather than considering @xmath3 coincident @xmath25-branes we will be interested in a ring of @xmath25-branes . as in @xcite",
    "this also has an exact description in terms of a coset model cft ( @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath11",
    ". this background solution will also provide us with a throat geometry to probe , which is more complicated than in the point - like case .",
    "in particular it is possible to find solutions that explore this throat region but without the string coupling blowing up and as such we can expect that perturbative techniques will be valid in this case .",
    "in addition we also couple an electric field to the @xmath1-brane worldvolume and investigate the interplay between electrical energy and the energy density , and consider how this affects the probe brane dynamics .",
    "since our configuration will appear pointlike at large distances , we expect some overlap with the work done in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in whether this picture will lead to the formation of bound orbits , which is of particluar interest for cosmology ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , and also the possible implications for tachyon rolling .",
    "we begin the note with a review of the supergravity background of the problem and introduce the effective @xmath1-brane action .",
    "we then go on to discuss the dynamics of the probe brane in the different limits of the theory before concluding with some remarks .",
    "we wish to study the dynamics of a @xmath0-brane in the background gravitational potential generated by a ring of @xmath3 , static @xmath4 branes in type ii string theory . in order to do this",
    "we must first consider the background fields which are given by the chs solution @xcite .",
    "we find that the metric , dilaton and ns @xmath12-field are    @xmath13    where @xmath14 label the coordinates parallel to the ns5-brane and the indices @xmath15 run over the four transverse dimensions and @xmath16 is the string coupling in the asymtotically flat region . as usual @xmath17",
    "is the @xmath18-form ns field strength , and @xmath19 is the harmonic function describing the @xmath4 branes which satisfies the poisson equation in the transverse space . for fivebranes at arbitrary positions with respect to an origin",
    ", the harmonic function is descibed by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the string length .",
    "the geometry under consideration in this note is obtained from the extremal limit of the rotating @xmath4 brane solutions discussed in @xcite , with the harmonic function given by    @xmath22    this represents a continuous uniform distribution of branes along a ring of radius @xmath23 , which is oriented in the @xmath24 plane in the transverse euclidean space .",
    "it will be convenent to make the following coordinate transformations to fully exploit the symmetry of the problem : @xmath25 which effectively defines an @xmath26 symmetry . in terms of these coordinate definitions ,",
    "the harmonic function reduces to @xmath27 we now wish to introduce our probe @xmath0-brane into this background which is described by the effective dbi action .",
    "we assume that the worldvolume of the probe fills out the directions @xmath28 , and use the reparameterization invariance present to go to static gauge .",
    "the transverse directions to the @xmath4 branes induce scalar fields on the @xmath0-brane world volume , whose behaviour is described by the dbi action @xmath29 @xmath30 is the @xmath0-brane tension , @xmath31 is the @xmath32 gauge field , whilst @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the pullbacks of the metric and the @xmath12 field to the brane : @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 run over the ten dimensional bulk spacetime and @xmath38 are the bulk metric and @xmath12-field .",
    "for the rest of this note we will be interested in homogenous solutions of the equations of motion , where the transverse scalars are time dependent only .",
    "this will also ensure that coupling to the b field vanishes and so we will ignore it from now on .",
    "we will also consider a non zero electric field ( only ) on the brane world volume , i.e @xmath39 .",
    "so , the induced metric becomes @xmath40 and upon substitution into ( [ eq : dbi ] ) we obtain @xmath41 where we have defined @xmath42 as the constant electric field strength in dimensionless units by absorbing the factors of @xmath43 .",
    "also we have assumed ( see @xcite ) that @xmath44 is small in order to obtain the relatively simple form of the action ( [ eq : action ] ) .    from the action we can also deduce the following canonical momenta : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents the effective ` mass ' of the brane .",
    "it will be useful to rescale these momenta to remove this mass dependence , and so we are left with : @xmath50 @xmath51 it now becomes a fairly straightforward procedure to calculate the canonical energy density of the brane .",
    "@xmath52 from which we obtain the following equation for the motion of @xmath53 and @xmath54 : @xmath55 since the rhs of this equation is non - negative it imposes constraints on the strength of the electric field .",
    "we first set the angular momentum terms to zero , which means that the following constraint must be satisfied : @xmath56 in order to determine the full constraint it is necessary to specify the trajectory of the probe brane .",
    "since there is an explicit @xmath57 symmetry we can choose to investigate the motion in the plane parallel to the ring ( i.e @xmath58 ) , or in the plane transverse to the ring ( i.e @xmath59 ) . in the first instance , setting @xmath54 to zero reduces the harmonic function ( [ eq : harmonic2 ] ) to @xmath60 which can easily be seen to be singular at @xmath61 when the probe brane hits the ring . upon insertion into the contraint equation",
    "we find : @xmath62 there are three cases to consider .",
    "firstly we have @xmath63 , which means that the rhs will vanish identically and so @xmath64 must be less than unity . in the limit of small @xmath64 which we are working",
    "this is automatically satisfied .",
    "these conditions are also the same in the @xmath65 case and in the @xmath66 cases",
    ".    we can also consider the case of motion transverse to the disk plane by fixing @xmath59 .",
    "this gives us a new harmonic function , namely @xmath67 which can be seen to be nowhere singular .",
    "as a result , the constraint equation is modified slightly to become : @xmath68 the constraint conditions , however , are essentially the same as those for the case of motion in the plane , the slight difference being that the lead term never blows up .",
    "now following @xcite we define the effective potential in the general case to be @xmath69    at this point we would like to investigate the equations of motion of the probe brane in this background , for simplicity and convenience we consider each case seperately .",
    "as discussed previously , the ring plane is identified with the coordinates @xmath53 and @xmath70 , and the harmonic function is given by ( [ eq : planeharmonic ] ) . in the throat geometry of the ring solution",
    "we can neglect the factor of unity in @xmath71 provided that @xmath72 .",
    "because of the distribution of the @xmath4-branes , we can consider probe motion either inside or outside of the ring .",
    "of course , the full equations of motion are complicated and need to be solved numerically ( see later ) , but we can make some progress by considering various limits .",
    "we first imagine @xmath73 , which puts the probe brane very close to the centre of the ring , and so we neglect the factor of @xmath53 in the expression for the harmonic function .",
    "the equation of motion now reads @xmath74 which has a solution given by @xmath75 i.e is linear in the bulk time @xmath76 .",
    "thus at @xmath76=0 we expect the probe to be at the centre of the ring , which is the furthest distance from the @xmath4 branes , and as time evolves it moves outwards . obviously ( [ eq : throatsoln1 ] ) will only be valid in the small @xmath53 regime and so this solution can not be trusted as the probe nears the ring . furthermore , we can see that the solution becomes time independent if the following constraint is satisfied @xmath77 and the probe will always remain at the origin .",
    "we can also consider the regime where the probe is located far from the ring , i.e @xmath78 , but with @xmath79 still larger than @xmath53 .",
    "the equations of motion are now modified slightly to become @xmath80 which gives us the solution @xmath81 this is the same expression that kutasov found in @xcite for a probe moving in the background of a stack of coincident @xmath4-branes , and reinforces our claim that the ring distribution appears pointlike at large distances .",
    "the above solution informs us that at @xmath82 the probe is at its maximum distance from the sources , and as time evolves it is gravitationally attracted towards the ring . of course",
    ", we must be aware that this solution is no longer valid in the regime where the probe is near the ring .",
    "so far we have made decent progress by simply considering the limits of the solutions , but in order to understand the ring background we must try and find explicit solutions for the equation of motion in the region close to the ring . in order to do this",
    "we have resorted to a numerical approach .",
    "consider first the case with @xmath83 .",
    "figs 1 and 2 show numerical solutions for the distance @xmath84 . in fig 1",
    ", we have taken the dimensionless energy density @xmath85 and the electric flux @xmath86 or @xmath87 and assumed a positive initial probe brane velocity and a starting value of @xmath53 outside the ring .",
    "( in this and all subsequent plots we have taken @xmath88 for simplicity ) .",
    "it is clear that in this case trajectories of the probe brane are bound to the ring and can not escape to infinity .",
    "the effect of turning on the electric flux on the probe is to increase its effective mass which results in the maximum distance away from the ring being reduced .",
    "fig 2 is the same situation but with @xmath89 . in this case",
    "both solutions describe a probe that can escape the ring and move to infinity , the case with no electric flux having a greater escape velocity .",
    "similar plots for starting positions inside the ring ( or trajectories where the initial velocity is towards the ring starting from @xmath90 ) show trajectories that eventually hit the ring at @xmath91 although strictly speaking , one can not follow these trajectories right to the ring location as in this region there are large string effects .",
    "these solutions can be understood in terms of the effective potential @xmath92 plotted for various values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "fig 3 shows four such plots , taking e.g. @xmath85 or @xmath95 and @xmath96 or @xmath97 .",
    "these plots cover the region from @xmath98 at the centre of the ring , to values outside .",
    "as in the previous section we initially consider the situation when @xmath99 .",
    "the equation of motion in this plane is similar to the one for motion in the ring plane , and we obtain the solution @xmath100 the same comments apply to this solution , except that in this instance the probe brane is no longer moving towards the @xmath4 branes as time evolves , since it is moving in the transverse plane to the ring .",
    "again we must be aware that this linear solution is only valid for small @xmath54 .",
    "if we now consider the case where @xmath101",
    ", then we can again imagine that at large enough distances the ring distibution will appear pointlike and we expect to recover a similar solution to the previous section .",
    "this is indeed the case , and the solution is @xmath102 where the same comments must apply when considering the critical value of the electric field .",
    "once again we can understand the solutions in between small or large values of @xmath103 by using numerical methods .",
    "given that a probe is attracted to the ns5 ring if it is postioned above it , we might guess that a brane , with small enough energy , falling towards the centre of the ring from above the plane of the ring , would pass through its centre and then extend below it to some maximum distance and then be attracted back through the centre of the ring and so on .",
    "that is we might expect a special solution describing the oscillatory motion of the probe through the ring centre .",
    "such a solution should match on to the linear solution described above when the probe is at a small distance either above or below the ring plane , ie when @xmath104 .",
    "fig4 shows a plot of the numerical solution in this case    the linear behaviour of @xmath105 as a function of @xmath76 , for small values of @xmath106 is evident from fig 4 so matches our analytic solution above . in this plot",
    "the probe starts from @xmath107 at @xmath82 and reaches a maximum distance below the ring of about @xmath108 .",
    "after this time the probe is attracted back up through the ring and the process repeats .",
    "the motion thus describes oscillation between the two zeros of the effective potential @xmath109 which is plotted in fig 5 .",
    "what is also noteworthy about this particular solution is that it is stable to stringy corrections since we can control the minimum distance the probe comes to the ring by making the ring radius sufficiently large .    in the plot of fig 5",
    "we have also shown the effect turning on some electric flux has on @xmath110 .",
    "its clear that it results in making this potential more postive everywhere and hence reduces the range and period of the oscillation through the center .",
    "what is particulary interesting is that there exists a critical value of the flux @xmath94 ( around @xmath111 ) beyond which oscillation is not possible and the probe is stuck at the ring center .",
    "the existence of this critical value of the flux @xmath94 ( for a given energy density @xmath93 ) can easily be understood .",
    "the energy density of a probe brane carrying flux @xmath94 which is at rest above the ring plane at distance @xmath112 ( with @xmath113 ) must satisfy @xmath114    where the harmonic function @xmath115 is given in ( [ eq : perpharmonic ] ) .",
    "now we see that for given @xmath93 , turning on the flux , @xmath94 , on a probe brane which was initially at some point @xmath112 above the ring plane means that in order to satisfy this equation the probe has to move closer to the plane , thus increasing the value of @xmath116 . but as we keep increasing @xmath94 this can not carry on indefinitely as there is a maximum value that @xmath117 can take ( for fixed value of @xmath118 ) , which is its value at the centre of the ring . thus there is a critical value of flux for a given @xmath119 .",
    "of course one has to bear in mind that we can not make the factor of @xmath120 too small as our derivations are only perturabtive in @xmath94 .",
    "so far we have only considered radial trajectories with vanishing angular momentum , at this point we must also consider the probe dynamics when the momenta are non zero .",
    "if we retain the angular momentum term in ( [ eq : eom ] ) we must try to solve @xmath122 as in the previous sections we begin by considering the limit @xmath73 , which puts the probe brane inside the ring . we find that the solution in this instance is given by the following expression ; @xmath123 this somewhat complicated expression reduces to ( [ eq : throatsoln1 ] ) in the limit @xmath124 . at the opposite end of the spectrum in the @xmath78 regime , we find that the solution is given by @xmath125 which again reproduces the earlier result in the limit of no angular momentum , and shows us that the momentum term has the effect of slowing the decrease of @xmath53 in the @xmath126 limit .",
    "furthermore this equation provdes us with bounds on the angular momentum , since it must satisfy the constraint @xmath127 if @xmath128 saturates this bound then the only solution is @xmath129 .",
    "thus we see that increasing the flux automatically leads to a reduction in the angular momentum .",
    "this is in agreement with our intuative picture of the flux providing extra mass on the brane .    in order to study trajectories of the full theory without resorting to the special limits in @xmath130 discussed above we again look to numerical solutions .",
    "we expect that solutions to the full theory will describe the probe brane in an unstable orbit about the ring .",
    "this is confirmed in fig 6 which is a parameteric plot in the @xmath131 plane of a solution which starts at ( @xmath132 ) at @xmath82 . in this plot we took @xmath133 and @xmath134 and",
    "we see the trajectory spiralling outwards from the ring . starting with different initial conditions",
    "would produce e.g. trajectories that spiral towards the ring ( either starting from inside or outside ) and eventually end on there .",
    "fig 7 shows the plot of @xmath110 vs @xmath136 with all other values as above . the same function is also shown for @xmath137 , in which case the spiral trajectories can not escape to infinity .",
    "figure 8 shows a 3-d plot of the effective potential for non - zero values for @xmath138 and @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively .",
    "for this value of the energy we expect trajectories corresponding to the probe brane moving away from the ring to escape to infinity , which corresponds to @xmath141 becoming negative at large distances in @xmath142 as can be seen in the plot .",
    "on the other hand probe branes moving towards the ring feel a generic repulsion due to the presence of a centrifugal barrier coming from the angular momentum terms in @xmath110 .",
    "this would lead to scattering of the probe brane off the ring which happens also in the case of point like source of ns5-branes , in the presence of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the plot also shows a ` gap ' in the centrifugal barrier located at the ring location @xmath143 so that its possible for some trajectories to still end on the ring itself ( ignoring possible stringy corrections ) .",
    "a numerical study is needed to distinguish these various possibilities .",
    "unfortunately this requires solving the full set of non - linear equations of motion for @xmath144 and @xmath145 which requires methods that go beyond those we used earlier",
    ". nevertheless it would be interesting to explore the nature of trajectories in this case .",
    "in this paper we have discussed same basic properties of probe - brane dynamics in the background geometry of a continuous distribution of ns5 branes around a ring . we have found similarities to the situation when the ns5 branes are concentrated at a point , namely that there is generally an attaction of the probe resulting in some trajectories ending on the ring or else describing the scattering of the probe off the ring .",
    "we have found an interesting solution where the probe can oscillate through the centre of the ring in a manner that is stable to stringy corrections if the ring is taken large enough .",
    "our studies involved a mixture of analytical and numerical methods .",
    "a number of future problems concerning the properties of d - branes moving in the ns5-ring geometry come to mind .",
    "the fate of probe branes falling towards the ring could be studied using similar methods to those developed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the ns5-brane ring geometry is rather different from that due to a point source we might expect different behaviour as regards the probes decay into closed string modes .",
    "indeed the decay crossection calculation would doubtless make use of the exact description of the system in terms of the @xmath11 cft . in this context",
    "it would be interesting to study the stability of the transverse oscillating solution discussed earlier , ( when the probe moves through the ring centre ) to decay into closed string modes .",
