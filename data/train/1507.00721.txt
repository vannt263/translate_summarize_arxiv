    "* ) and out of the galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) through large - scale gas flows .",
    "likewise , galaxies also grow through both major ( mass ratio @xmath12 or lower ) and minor ( mass ratio @xmath13 or higher ) mergers with other galaxies .",
    "such events typically contribute both stars and gas , thereby building up the galactic stellar spheroid population and providing fuel for future generations of star formation .",
    "the role of mergers and merger - induced star formation compared to in - situ star formation in building up the present day galaxy population has been the subject of considerable debate , with various studies claiming both that mergers are @xcite and are not @xcite major drivers of star formation and galactic stellar mass assembly since @xmath14 .    significant effort has therefore been invested both in constraining the evolution of the merger fraction for star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , it is often challenging to intepret such indices unambiguously because @xmath10 galaxies are intrinsically clumpy and irregular and similar disturbed morphologies can arise both in merging systems and in isolated star forming galaxies due to internal dynamical instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative way of identifying major mergers is to look for close angular pairs ( @xmath15 kpc , @xmath16 arcsec at @xmath17 ) .",
    "when the velocity separation between the two components in such a pair is @xmath18 @xmath19(see discussion by * ? ? ?",

    "* ) are combined with physically motivated timescales for interaction the overall agreement on merger rates between different studies is relatively good @xcite .",
    "one major complication faced by such efforts to constrain the merger rate ( and the physical characteristics of the merging galaxies ) however is the incidence of _ false _ pairs resulting from chance angular alignments of galaxies separated by large cosmological distances . in the absence of kinematic information",
    ", the false morphological pair fraction can be greater than 50% depending on the adopted impact parameter ( see , e.g. , discussion by * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and whether or not photometric redshift selection techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) can be used to help trim the list of potential companions .",
    "although corrections for the false - pair contribution can also be estimated statistically , such statistical corrections do not identify _ which _ are the true physical pairs , leading to substantial uncertainty in the derived properties of major mergers as a galaxy class .    in a recent contribution @xcite we used _",
