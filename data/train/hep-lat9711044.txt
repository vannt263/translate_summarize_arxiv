    "simulations using these actions have shown that lattice spacings of 0.1 fm or less and lattice volumes of @xmath4 or larger are needed in order to hold systematic errors to the 10% level .",
    "such simulations are major undertakings and require enormous computing power to extract even the most basic of hadronic observables , the hadron masses ( see  @xcite for an example and  @xcite for a recent review ) .    during the past few years",
    ", considerable efforts have been devoted to improving lattice actions .",
    "the idea is to reduce or remove the discretization errors from the actions so that they have better continuum - like behavior . at the same time , errors due to the lattice regularization are accounted for through the renormalization of the coefficients multiplying the improvement operators .",
    "the hope is the use of improved actions will allow one to simulate efficiently and accurately on coarse lattices , such that computer resources may be redirected to the simulation of qcd rather than quenched qcd .",
    "moreover , one may turn the focus of investigation towards quantities of experimental interest .",
    "the way to develop improved discretizations of continuum actions is not unique .",
    "there are numerous programs in this endeavor having their foundation in one of two formulations .",
    "one is based on lattice perturbation theory which is used to derive the renormalized coefficients through a mean - field reordering of the perturbative expansion , as recently reviewed by lepage  @xcite .",

    "fixed - point fermion actions have been studied in free field theory  @xcite and in simulations  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we report further calculations of the light hadron spectrum using the @xmath0 tadpole - improved gluon action of  @xcite and the d@xmath5 action proposed by hamber and wu  @xcite many years ago .",
    "this action is an @xmath0 next - nearest - neighbor fermion action with tadpole - improved estimates of the coupling renormalizations .",
    "this action is selected primarily due to its simplicity .",
    "the cost of simulating it is about a factor of two as compared to standard wilson fermions .",
    "our goal is to study its feasibility as an alternative action to sw which has the clover term , or to d234 which has both next - nearest - neighbor couplings and the clover term .",
    "this work extends previous studies of the d@xmath5 action @xcite through finer lattice spacings , improved statistics , and the simulation of additional observables .",

    "however , the on - shell improvement program leaves some freedom in the relative values of the coefficients of the improvement operators . in this investigation",
