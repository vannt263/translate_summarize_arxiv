    "<S> a rich variety of classical soliton solutions have been found using the technology of dirichlet ( @xmath0 ) branes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these must be taken into account in any study of possible ground states and the spectra of excitations . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial ingredient in such a study is understanding the interactions between @xmath0 branes and ` elementary ' closed - string states , and with other @xmath0 branes . </S>",
    "<S> in general , since recoil perturbs the classical @xmath0-brane solutions , one might expect that such interactions , would involve departures from conformal symmetry and criticality .    </S>",
    "<S> one example of this recoil phenomenon was given in  @xcite , where the perturbation of a @xmath0 particle by interaction with a closed - string state in flat space was considered . </S>",
    "<S> in the low - energy limit , where the closed - string energy @xmath4 , the mass of the @xmath0 particle , it was shown that the background metric was perturbed to an anti - de - sitter ( ads ) form  @xcite . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the perturbation was described by a logarithmic pair of world - sheet operators corresponding to the position and velocity of the struck @xmath0 brane , and it was shown that momentum was conserved during the interaction and recoil process .    the purpose of this paper is to extend and generalize this previous discussion by considering a generic interaction between two extended @xmath0 branes that do not have particle interpretations . </S>",
    "<S> such constructions may be relevant in the context of viewing the observable world as a @xmath2 brane embedded in a higher - dimensional space - time , with the extra ` bulk ' dimensions being transverse to the @xmath2-brane coordinates  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find just one case in which the recoil space has an ads geometry , namely ads@xmath5 , which arises when a macroscopic string ( @xmath1 brane ) moving along some bulk direction in space - time hits a @xmath6 brane perpendicular to the direction of motion , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this physical problem is analogous to a straight stick hitting a flat sheet of paper , which we would expect to fold after the impact . as in the closed - string/@xmath0-particle scattering case </S>",
    "<S> considered previously , the @xmath0-brane/@xmath0-brane interaction is described by a logarithmic pair of world - sheet operators . in this case , they do indeed describe folding of the struck @xmath0 brane . </S>",
    "<S> we are also able to demonstrate that momentum is conserved during the interaction , as in the previous closed - string/@xmath0-particle scattering case .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been many previous studies of string theory on an ads@xmath5 background  @xcite , which can be described using a critical conformal field theory . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis opens the way to studies of transitions between this and other string backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> it confirms that such transitions are described by non - conformal logarithmic field theories . </S>",
    "<S> we also recall that the boundary of the ads@xmath5 background is equivalent to an appropriate coset of the @xmath7 manifold that appears in the analysis of two - dimensional black holes in string theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the mathematical analysis presented here could be used as the basis for studies of the formation of such black - hole backgrounds , much as transitions between different two - dimensional string black holes have already been described in terms of logarithmic pairs of world - sheet operators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the study of such a possibility lies beyond the scope of this article . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm    we first review the world - sheet formalism based on logarithmic operators that was developed in a series of papers  @xcite , for the mathematical description of the recoil of a @xmath0 brane when struck by a closed - string state or by another @xmath0 brane . </S>",
    "<S> although closed - string/@xmath0-brane scattering has been studied using this formalism , we are unaware of any treatment of @xmath0-brane/@xmath0-brane scattering in the relevant literature so far . </S>",
    "<S> logarithmic conformal field theory  @xcite lies on the border between finite conformal field theories and general renormalizable two  dimensional quantum field theories . </S>",
    "<S> it is the relevant tool  @xcite for this problem , because the recoil process involves a change of state ( transition ) in the string background , and as such is not described by a conformal field theory . </S>",
    "<S> this change of state induced by the recoil process can be described a change in the @xmath8model background , and as such is a non  equilibrium process . </S>",
    "<S> this is reflected  @xcite in the logarithmic operator algebra itself .    </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in references  @xcite in the case of @xmath0brane string solitons , their recoil after interaction with a closed - string ( graviton ) state is characterized by a @xmath8 model deformed by a pair of logarithmic operators  @xcite : @xmath9 defined on the boundary @xmath10 of the string world sheet . here </S>",

    "<S> the remaining @xmath12 denote the transverse bulk directions . in the case of @xmath0 particles , which were examined in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the index @xmath13 takes the value @xmath14 only , in which case the operators ( [ logpair ] ) act as deformations of the conformal field theory on the world sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath15 describes the movement of the @xmath0 brane induced by the scattering , where @xmath16 is its recoil velocity , and @xmath17 describes quantum fluctuations in the initial position @xmath18 of the @xmath0 particle . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown rigorously  @xcite that the logarithmic conformal algebra ensures energy  </S>",
    "<S> momentum conservation during the recoil process : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the momentum of the propagating closed string state before ( after ) the recoil , and @xmath21 is the string coupling , which is assumed here to be weak enough to ensure that @xmath0 branes are very massive , with mass @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the string length .    the correct specification of the logarithmic pair in equation ( [ logpair2 ] ) entails a regulating parameter @xmath24 , which appears inside the @xmath25 operator : @xmath26 in order to realize the logarithmic algebra between the operators @xmath27 and @xmath0 , one takes  @xcite : @xmath28 \\equiv \\lambda , \\label{defeps}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are infrared ( ultraviolet ) world  sheet cutoffs . </S>",
    "<S> the recoil operators ( [ logpair2 ] ) are slightly relevant , in the sense of the renormalization group for the world  sheet field theory , having small conformal dimensions @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the @xmath8 model perturbed by these operators is not conformal for @xmath32 , and the theory requires liouville dressing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> momentum conservation is assured when the liouville field is identified with the time variable . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm    in the case of @xmath6 branes , the pertinent deformations are slightly more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in  @xcite , the deformations are given by @xmath33 the @xmath34 components of the two - index couplings @xmath35 include the collective momenta and coordinates of the @xmath0 brane as in the @xmath0particle case above , but now there are additional couplings @xmath36 , which describe the folding of the @xmath0 brane . </S>",
    "<S> such a folding may be caused by scattering with another macroscopic object , namely another @xmath0 brane , propagating in a transverse direction , as shown schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] for the case of a @xmath1 brane hitting a @xmath2 brane . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is the most interesting to us , since it generates an ads@xmath5 space , as we show below . for symmetry reasons , in the situation depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , the folding of the @xmath2 brane occurs symmetrically around the axis of the @xmath1 brane . in this case , the precise logarithmic operator deformations shown in ( [ logpair2 ] ) , which pertain only to the spatial region @xmath37 for the dirichlet coordinates , should be supplemented with their counterparts for the @xmath38 region as well . </S>",
    "<S> this would , in principle , require additional @xmath39 factors , which would complicate the analysis without introducing any new points of principle . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for simplicity , we restrict ourselves here to the @xmath37 patch of space - time , away from the hypersurface @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> . this will be implicit in what follows .    </S>",
    "<S> the folding couplings @xmath41 , are relevant couplings with world  </S>",
    "<S> sheet renormalization  </S>",
    "<S> group @xmath42 functions of the form @xmath43 this implies that one may construct an exactly marginal set of couplings @xmath44 by redefining @xmath45 the renormalized couplings @xmath46 were shown in  @xcite to play the rle of the physical recoil velocity of the @xmath0 brane , while the remaining @xmath47 , describe the folding of the @xmath6 brane for @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in  @xcite , the deformations ( [ logpair ] ) create a local distortion of the space - time surrounding the recoiling folded @xmath0 brane , which may be determined using the method of liouville dressing . in  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we concentrated on describing the resulting space - time in the case when a @xmath0 particle , embedded in a @xmath0-dimensional space time , recoils after the scattering of a closed string off the @xmath0particle defect . to leading order in the recoil velocity @xmath49 of the @xmath0 particle , the resulting space - time </S>",
    "<S> was found , for times @xmath50 long after the scattering event at @xmath51 , to be equivalent to a rindler wedge , with apparent ` acceleration ' @xmath52  @xcite , where @xmath53 is defined above ( [ defeps ] ) . for times </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 , the space - time is flat minkowski  , which leads to particle production and decoherence for a low - energy spectator field theory observer who performs local scattering experiments long after the scattering , and far away from the location of the collision of the closed string with the @xmath0 particle  @xcite . ] . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm    we now discuss the generalization of this phenomenon to the case of single @xmath0-brane/@xmath0-brane scattering . for definiteness , we first consider the case where there are @xmath55 transverse ( bulk ) dimensions ( with dirichlet boundary conditions ) , and @xmath56 are longitudinal coordinates on the brane , which obey neumann boundary conditions . in this generic case </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the folding of the recoiling brane along several directions , determined by couplings @xmath57 of appropriate logarithmic operators of the form ( [ logpair2 ] ) , and the recoil - velocity vector of the @xmath0 brane along the @xmath58th bulk direction is denoted by @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned previously , we restrict ourselves for simplicity to the region of space - time in which @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> the folding / recoil deformations of the @xmath6 brane ( [ logpair2 ] ) are relevant deformations , with anomalous dimension @xmath60 , which disturbs the conformal invariance of the @xmath8 model , and restoration of conformal invariance requires liouville dressing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to determine the effect of such dressing on the space - time geometry , it is essential to write  @xcite the boundary recoil deformations as a bulk world - sheet deformations @xmath61 where the @xmath62 denote the renormalized folding / recoil couplings ( [ marginal ] ) , in the sense discussed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we have already mentioned , such couplings are marginal on a flat world sheet . from now on , for notational simplicity , we rename @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the operators ( [ a1 ] ) are marginal also on a curved world sheet , provided  @xcite one liouville - dresses the ( bulk ) integrand by multiplying it by a factor @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the liouville field and @xmath66 is the gravitational conformal dimension , which is related to the flat - world - sheet anomalous dimension @xmath67 of the recoil operator , viewed as a bulk world - sheet deformation , as follows  @xcite : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the central - charge deficit of the bulk world - sheet theory . in the recoil prblem at hand , </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in  @xcite , @xmath70 for weak folding deformations @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath72 to leading order in perturbation theory in @xmath53 , to which we restrict ourselves here .    </S>",
    "<S> we next remark that , as the analysis of  @xcite indicates , the @xmath73-dependent field operators @xmath74 scale as follows with @xmath53 : @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a heavyside step function without any field content , evaluated in the limit @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk deformations , therefore , yield the following @xmath8-model terms : @xmath78 where the subscripts @xmath79 denote world - sheet zero modes . upon the interpretation of the liouville zero mode @xmath80 as target time , the deformations ( [ bulksigma ] ) yield space - time metric deformations in a @xmath8-model sense , which were interpreted in  @xcite as expressing the distortion of the space - time surrounding the recoiling @xmath0-brane soliton .    for clarity </S>",
    "<S> , we now drop the subscripts @xmath79 for the rest of this paper , and we work in a region of space - time on the @xmath2 brane such that @xmath81 is finite in the limit @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting space - time distortion is therefore described by the metric elements @xmath82 to leading order in @xmath83 . </S>",

    "<S> the logarithmic pair discussed here may open the way to a description of the transition between flat space and a two - dimensional black hole , but pursuing that possibility lies beyond the scope of this paper . </S>"
