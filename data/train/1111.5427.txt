    "the study of the star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies of different types has been lately improved due to the new available data .",
    "remarkably , the focus has been turned to the closest galaxies as well as to star - forming regions within our galaxy .",
    "for these nearby objects , the resolution of the data offers us an opportunity to test whether the proposed sfr calibrators trace indeed the location of the stellar births ( churchwell et al .",
    "2006 ; relao & kennicutt 2009 , among others ) .",
    "recently , a new study on the star - forming regions in the magellanic clouds has analysed the relation of the amount of flux at the different wavelengths via the seds of these objects ( lawton et al .",
    "2010 ) .    within the herm33es key project ( kramer et al .",
    "2010 ) we are obtaining maps of the entire galaxy m33 at wavelengths between 100@xmath1 m  and 500@xmath1 m  using pacs and spire instruments on herschel .",
    "verley et al ( 2010 ) identified a set of hii  regions in the north of m33 showing a shell - like morphology in these infrared bands , and also traced by the h@xmath0  emission . in order to further study this phenomenon",
    "we have analysed the seds of a set of hii  regions in m33 covering different morphologies .",
    "the resolution of our data ( from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) is good enough to perform such as study .",
    "we use an h@xmath0  image of m33 ( hoopes & walterbos 2000 ) to identify a set of hii  regions for which clear morphology can be recognised .",
    "a morphological classification was obtained with the following criteria : _ filled _ regions are objects showing a compact knot , _ mixed _ regions are those presenting several compact knots and filamentary structures , and _ shells _ are regions showing arcs .",
    "we add another classification for the most spherical , closed shells called _",
    "clear shells_. out of the 120 selected hii  regions , 9 are filled , 47 mixed , 37 shell and 27 clear shells .",
    "our sample is distributed over the whole disk of m33 ( see fig .  1 , left ) .",
    "we use multi - wavelength data from fuv ( galex ) to 250@xmath1 m  ( herschel ) smoothed to a common 20@xmath4 resolution and regridded to a 6@xmath4 pixel size ( corresponding to those of the 250@xmath1 m  herschel image ) to obtain the sed for each region .",
    "photometry was performed using individual apertures for each object and local background was subtracted to eliminate the contribution of the diffuse medium to the hii  region fluxes . in fig .  1 ( right ) we show the seds for our objects together with a _ characteristic",
    "_ sed for each classification obtained with the mean values in each band for all the hii  regions in the corresponding classification . from fig .",
    "1 ( right ) we observe the following trends : ( i ) mixed regions are more luminous in all bands as they normally have several knots of star formation , ( ii ) the slope of the sed between the fuv - nuv wavelength range and h@xmath0  is steeper for shells and clear shells than for filled and mixed , ( iii ) filled and mixed objects have more 24@xmath1 m  relative to 8@xmath1 m  than the shells and clear shells do .",

    "the 100@xmath1m/70@xmath1 m , 160@xmath1m/70@xmath1 m  or 160@xmath1m/100@xmath1 m  ratios normally trace the temperature of the warm dust emitting from 24@xmath1 m  to 160@xmath1 m . in fig .  2 ( left ) we plot the 100@xmath1m/70@xmath1 m  ratio versus the h@xmath0  surface brightness for our sample .",
    "at high h@xmath0   surface brightness the 100@xmath1m/70@xmath1 m  flux density ratio decreases showing that highly luminous hii  regions tend to have warmer dust .",

    "there is a dispersion in the 100@xmath1m/70@xmath1 m  ratio showing that these regions present a range of dust temperatures . for the shells , the relative location between stars and dust can affect more the temperature of the dust than the intensity of the stellar radiation field and",

    "[ tdust ] ( right ) we show the emission line profile for one of the clear shells of our sample .",
    "the h@xmath0  profile shows the characteristic double peak of the shell emission , and there is a displacement between the h@xmath0  and fuv / nuv emission , with the fuv / nuv emission located in the inner part of the region . the ratio h@xmath0/fuv is lower in the centre than in the boundaries of the shell , which could be due to : ( i ) the existence of a young stellar population within the shell , or ( ii ) the ionising photons from the central cluster reaching the shell and ionising the gas within the rim .",
    "the emission at all ir bands follows clearly the h@xmath0  shape of the shell : at 24@xmath1 m  and 250@xmath1 m  the emission decays in the centre of the shell and they are enhanced at the boundaries . the same trend , though not so clear ,",
    "is seen at 70@xmath1 m , 100@xmath1 m , and 160@xmath1 m . the emission of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pah ) at 8@xmath1 m  is marked by the location of the shell boundaries ."
