    "toric residue is defined for every collection of @xmath3 divisors on an @xmath0-dimensional complete toric variety as long as they do not have a common point .",
    "it appears in a variety of contexts , e.g. in mirror symmetry @xcite or in sparse polynomial systems @xcite , @xcite .",
    "toric residues were first introduced by d.  cox in @xcite in the case when the divisors are ample and linearly equivalent . in @xcite cattani , cox , and dickenstein extended the definition to the general case and revealed a connection between the toric residue and the sum of local grothendieck residues in the torus .",
    "they also provided an algorithm for computing the toric residue when the divisors are ample using grbner bases .",
    "another approach was taken by dandrea and khetan in @xcite where they compute the toric residue as a quotient of two determinants .",
    "one of the key ideas in both methods is reduction to a particular choice of @xmath3 @xmath6-invariant divisors for which the toric residue is one .",
    "this motivates the problem of computing the toric residue for an arbitrary choice of @xmath3 @xmath6-invariant divisors .",
    "let @xmath1 be a projective toric variety of dimension @xmath0 defined by a convex lattice polytope @xmath2 .",
    "consider @xmath3 effective @xmath6-invariant divisors @xmath9 on @xmath1 whose sum @xmath10 equals @xmath7 ( or more generally the support of @xmath10 equals @xmath7 ) .",
    "then the toric residue map for @xmath9 has a nice combinatorial description : notice that the irreducible components of the @xmath5 correspond to the facets of the polytope @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we get a `` coloring '' of the facets of @xmath2 into @xmath3 colors : a facet has color  @xmath11 if the corresponding irreducible divisor appears in @xmath5 . let us now pick a color @xmath12 for each facet of the @xmath3 facets of the standard @xmath0-simplex @xmath13 , so that all facets have different colors . choose a continuous piecewise linear map @xmath14 that matches the colors .",
    "such a map exists as long as @xmath15 is empty .",
    "the degree of @xmath16 is independent of the choice of @xmath16 and is called the combinatorial degree of the coloring of @xmath2 ( we give the precise definition in section  [ s : cdeg ] ) .",
    "we prove that the toric residue for @xmath9 coincides with the combinatorial degree of the coloring defined by the @xmath5 ( theorem  [ t : main1 ] , theorem  [ t : main2 ] ) .",
    "the combinatorial degree can be computed explicitly as a signed number of certain complete flags of faces of  @xmath2 ( see theorem  [ t : flags ] ) .    in the second part of the paper we consider a radical monomial ideal @xmath8 of the homogeneous coordinate ring @xmath17 of @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath18 be the minimal generating set of @xmath8 .",
    "consider a homogeneous polynomial @xmath19 of semiample degree @xmath20 ( i.e. the line bundles corresponding to @xmath20 are generated by global sections ) .",
    "it follows from @xcite , section  2 that if @xmath20 is @xmath21-ample the polynomial  @xmath22 belongs to @xmath8 as long as @xmath23 is empty , where @xmath5 is the zero set of @xmath24 on  @xmath1 . in theorem  [ t : monomial ] we extend this observation .",
    "it is known that if @xmath20 is semiample there exists a unique toric variety @xmath25 and a surjective morphism @xmath26 such that @xmath20 is the pull - back of an ample class on @xmath25 ( see @xcite , theorem  1.2 ) .",
    "we show that a generic polynomial @xmath22 of semiample degree lies in @xmath8 if and only if @xmath27 is empty on @xmath25 .",
    "this condition also has a combinatorial interpretation ( theorem  [ t : monomial ] , part ( 4 ) ) .",
    "let us remark that it is still an open question how to compute the toric residue map for arbitrary non - ample divisors even when we know that the map is an isomorphism ( e.g. for big and nef divisors ) .",
    "in the final section we apply our results to this problem .",
    "we obtain a combinatorial condition when it is possible to construct an element of toric residue one .",
    "more results in this direction are obtained in the joint work with a.  khetan @xcite .",

    "in this section we study radical monomial ideals of the homogeneous coordinate ring @xmath160 of @xmath1 .",
    "we answer the following question : when does a homogeneous polynomial @xmath19 of semiample degree @xmath20 belong to a radical monomial ideal @xmath8 ?",
    "let @xmath227 be a @xmath6-invariant cartier divisor on  @xmath1 .",

    "note that if @xmath233 and @xmath234 are linearly equivalent then @xmath235 is a linear function on @xmath236 .",
    "the divisor @xmath233 also determines a rational convex polytope @xmath237 in @xmath150 : @xmath238 linearly equivalent divisors have the same polytope up to a parallel translation .    a cartier divisor @xmath233 is called _ semiample _ if the corresponding line bundle @xmath162 is generated by global sections .",

    "note that we allow multi - colored rays and not all the rays of @xmath111 are colored , in general .",

    "[ t : monomial ] consider a radical monomial ideal @xmath270 of the homogeneous coordinate ring @xmath160 of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath161 be semiample .",
    "the following are equivalent    1 .",
    "@xmath271 2 .",
    "@xmath272 , where @xmath22 is a generic section of @xmath20 , 3 .",
    "@xmath273 , 4 .",
    "no ( maximal ) cone of @xmath250 contains images of rays of @xmath111 of all @xmath261 colors , 5 .",
    "@xmath274 , where @xmath26 is the morphism determined by @xmath258 , and @xmath5 is the zero locus of @xmath24 on @xmath1 .",
    "( 1)@xmath275(2 ) is clear .",
    "( 2)@xmath275(3 ) let @xmath227 be a representative of @xmath20 and consider its polytope  @xmath237 .",
    "since @xmath22 is generic , it is a linear combination with non - zero complex coefficients of the monomials @xmath276 as @xmath254 varies over the set @xmath277 ( @xcite , section  3.4 ) . but @xmath8 is a monomial ideal thus @xmath272 if and only if every @xmath276 belongs to @xmath8 .    in homogeneous coordinates @xmath278 . from this",
    "you can see that every such monomial is divisible by some @xmath279 , where @xmath280 is a vertex of @xmath237 .",
    "thus we can assume that @xmath254 varies over the vertices of @xmath237 .    when @xmath254 is a vertex of @xmath237 we have @xmath281 if @xmath282 and @xmath283 if @xmath284 , where @xmath285 is the cone of @xmath250 corresponding to @xmath254 .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath286 where all exponents are positive . therefore @xmath287 for all vertices @xmath254 if and only if for every maximal cone @xmath117 of @xmath250 there exists @xmath99 such that @xmath288 ( by ( [ e : homcoord ] ) and the fact that in @xmath289 every variable has exponent 0 or 1 ) . by the definition of @xmath264",
    "the latter is equivalent to @xmath273 .",
    "( 4)@xmath275(5 ) suppose there exists a maximal cone @xmath290 in @xmath250 which contains the images @xmath291 , where @xmath292 has color @xmath11 .",
    "it can be readily seen that the morphism @xmath26 maps every orbit @xmath293 , @xmath294 onto the orbit @xmath295 , where @xmath296 is the smallest cone of @xmath250 containing @xmath297 , and hence it maps the closure @xmath298 onto the closure @xmath299 .",
    "it follows then that for every @xmath214 the image @xmath300 contains the closed orbit @xmath301 . since @xmath302 is an irreducible component of @xmath5 we get a contradiction .",
    "the other implication is similar .",
    "( 3)@xmath275(4 ) before we give a proof let us take a closer look at the ideal @xmath264 .",
    "we say that a collection of rays @xmath303 of @xmath111 is _ primitive with respect to @xmath250 _ if its image under @xmath256 does not lie in any of the cones of @xmath250 , but the image of every its proper subset does . the corresponding collection of variables @xmath304 will be also called primitive with respect to @xmath250 .",
    "the following is a slight generalization of the batyrev description of the irrelevant ideal of the homogeneous coordinate ring .",
    "the irreducible components of the variety @xmath305 of the ideal @xmath264 are the coordinate planes @xmath306 for each collections @xmath304 primitive with respect to @xmath250 .    by definition",
    "the variety @xmath305 is the union of @xmath307 , where for every maximal @xmath308 we pick a variable @xmath309 whose corresponding ray is mapped outside of  @xmath117 .",
    "since the image of every primitive collection @xmath303 does not lie in any of the cones of @xmath250 the corresponding collection @xmath304 appears among the collections @xmath310 .",
    "therefore , @xmath311 on the other hand , every collection @xmath310 contains a primitive one .",
    "( if a collection of rays whose image does not lie in any cone is not primitive it contains a proper subset whose image does not lie in any cone etc . )",
    "thus , @xmath312 for some primitive collection @xmath303 . the lemma follows .",
    "now we will finish the proof of the theorem .",
    "we have two irreducible decompositions : @xmath313 then @xmath314 if and only if for every collection @xmath315 with @xmath316 , there exists a collection @xmath304 primitive with respect to @xmath250 such that @xmath317 i.e. , @xmath318 .",
    "but the latter is equivalent to ( 4 ) . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath319 does not contain any primitive collection then its image lies in some cone @xmath117 of @xmath250 , i.e. @xmath117 contains images of rays of all @xmath261 colors .",
    "the converse is also clear .",
    "let @xmath1 be a complete @xmath0-dimensional toric variety and @xmath182 homogeneous polynomials of degrees @xmath320 , respectively .",
    "consider the corresponding toric residue map @xmath321 as recently proved by cox and dickenstein @xcite this map is an isomorphism if the degrees @xmath322 are semiample and have @xmath0-dimensional polytopes .",
    "then the computation of the toric residue reduces to the problem of finding a homogeneous polynomial of residue one .",
    "this is an open problem .",
    "the results of the previous sections allow us to say something in this direction .",
    "assume @xmath1 is projective defined by a projective fan @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath323 be the fan associated with the degree @xmath322 and @xmath324 the corresponding map as in section  [ s : semiample ] .",
    "we say that a disjoint simplicial coloring @xmath325 is _ compatible _ with @xmath326 if it satisfies the condition of theorem  [ t : monomial ] for each @xmath327 , i.e. no cone of @xmath327 contains images under @xmath328 of rays of all @xmath3 colors , for every @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath320 be semiample degrees on @xmath1 and @xmath326 the corresponding fans .",
    "fix any disjoint simplicial coloring of @xmath111 compatible with @xmath326 : @xmath329 let @xmath330 be squarefree monomials , @xmath12 . then for any homogeneous polynomials @xmath182 of degrees @xmath320 there are homogeneous polynomials @xmath331 such that @xmath332 furthermore , @xmath333 where @xmath334 is the combinatorial degree of the coloring above .    the existence of @xmath331 is a consequence of theorem  [ t : monomial ] .",
    "the first statement in ( [ e : cor ] ) follows from the global transformation law ( theorem 0.1 ,  @xcite ) and the second statement follows from theorem  [ t : main1 ] .",
    "notice that if the degrees are ample then @xmath335 and we obtain many different ways of constructing a polynomial of residue one .",
    "in fact , every choice of a disjoint simplicial coloring of @xmath111 of combinatorial degree one gives rise to such a polynomial .",
    "this extends previously known constructions by dandrea and khetan @xcite and cattani , cox and dickenstein @xcite .",
    "also , when the degrees are the same ( @xmath336 ) there are many ways of choosing a compatible coloring of combinatorial degree one .",
    "it is not true , however , that compatible colorings of combinatorial degree one exist for any collection of @xmath3 semiample degrees .",
