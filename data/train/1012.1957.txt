    "cold dark matter is one of the most important components in the universe .",
    "the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the large scale distribution of galaxies can not be naturally explained without the cold dark matter component .",
    "the mean density parameter of the cold dark matter has been measured precisely,@xcite but its true character has not been identified . the elementary particle physics predicts possible candidates of the cold dark matter , and many experiments are ongoing aiming at a direct measurement .",
    "the cold dark matter is considered to be distributed associated with each galaxy , forming dark matter halo .",
    "then , the investigation of the structure of the halos is quite important in exploring the nature and the origin of the dark matter .",
    "the strong gravitational lensing is a useful probe of the halo - structure ( see , e.g.,@xcite for a review ) .",
    "especially , a lens system near einstein ring is useful because a wealth of information can be obtained.@xcite    besides , the strong lensing systems are also useful as a tool of the dark energy study.@xcite@xcite because of the recent observational developments , many strong lensing systems have been found .",
    "the strong lensing statistics is now becoming one of the powerful tool for exploring the nature of the dark energy.@xcite future dark energy surveys will detect much more strong lensing systems ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) , and the strong lensing system will play a more important roll in cosmology .    in realistic situations , the mass distribution in a halo is not simple , which makes reconstruction of the lens model complicated .",
    "the lens equation is complicated for a non - spherical lens model , which needs to be solved numerically .",
    "then , analytic approximate approach to strong lensing system is useful , if its validity and accuracy are guaranteed .",
    "a perturbative approach to the lensing system close to the einstein ring configuration was developed , e.g.,@xcite .",
    "recently , alard extended the perturbative approach , which is applied to analyse lensing systems.@xcite@xcite    in the present paper , we investigate the validity of the perturbative approach to the lensing system close to an einstein ring , assuming an elliptical lens model .",
    "we demonstrate the validity of the perturbative approach quantitatively , by comparing with an exact approach on the basis of the numerical method , focusing on the shape of the image , the magnification , the caustics , and the critical line . using the approximate method , expanded in terms of the ellipticity parameter of the lens model , we derive simple approximate formulas which characterise an elliptical lensing system near the einstein ring in an analytic way .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly review the basic formulas for the gravitational lensing and the perturbative approach to a perturbed einstein ring , based on the work by alard.@xcite in section 3 , we compare the perturbative approach with the exact approach that relies on a numerical method , focusing on the shape of lensed images , the caustics , the critical curve , and the magnification , respectively .",
