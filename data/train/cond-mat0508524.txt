    "orbital interaction is used mainly as a _ qualitative _ concept in chemistry .",
    "examples are frontier orbital theory or the isolobal principle .",
    "two orbitals are said to interact when they have similar energy and/or matching spatial distribution and/or matching occupation .",
    "this concept is also important in theoretical chemistry : for example , in complete - active - space calculations , one chooses ( interacting ) orbitals to form the active space .",
    "however , there is no unique quantitative measure of orbital interaction .",
    "one way to obtain a quantitative measure of orbital interaction is to utilise the concept of entanglement .",
    "namely , if one divides the hilbert space for a given correlated wave function into two parts , then one can determine the entanglement of the two parts for the given wave function .",
    "for example , a division of a hilbert space into one orbital and the space spanned by all the other orbitals defines the entanglement of this specific orbital with the rest of the hilbert space .",
    "the more an orbital is entangled , the more it exchanges information with the other orbitals within the wave function .",
    "it is therefore natural to identify entanglement with orbital interaction .",
    "the advantage of this interpretation is that quantum information theory  @xcite defines a _ quantitative _ measure of the entanglement and hence of orbital interaction : the von neumann entropy @xmath3 .",
    "the disadvantage of using such a definition in calculations is that @xmath3 is a function of density - matrix eigenvalues .",
    "consequently , a correlated wave function must be obtained before a von neumann entropy can be calculated .    in order to proceed",
    ", one must use a method that produces an approximate wave function from which the von neumann entropies can be calculated in a simple fashion .",
    "in addition , the approximate results should be close to those for the exact wave function .",
    "one suitable technique is to solve the full - configuration - interaction ( fci ) problem using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite .",
    "this method produces wave functions and energies with a well - defined error .",
    "in addition to control of the accuracy of the wave function , the dmrg allows easy access to operators and expectation values in second - quantised form .",
    "we use this approach in order to calculate the von neumann entropies in a straightforward way .    in the following ,",
    "we argue that a reliable measure of the orbital interaction between two orbitals can be formed by subtracting the von neumann entropy of the two orbitals taken together from the sum of the individual von neumann entropies of each orbital .",
    "we then explore the utility of this measure and how their properties depend on the accuracy of the wave function , we investigate four example molecules which contain different types of chemical bonds : lif , co , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that the results do not depend significantly on the accuracy of the wave function .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to determine the orbital interaction using a comparatively inexpensive calculation .",
    "we then apply this definition of orbital interaction to a problem in theoretical chemistry : namely , the ordering problem in the dmrg algorithm . one ingredient needed to define the dmrg algorithm is to order the orbitals that span the hilbert space onto a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "this ordering has a significant influence on the convergence of the energy . in order to find an ordering that ensures a good convergence ,",
    "the literature offers several approaches  @xcite , which all have one aspect in common : they define a measure of orbital interaction and order the orbitals in a way so that strongly interacting orbitals are near each other .",
    "therefore , the measure of orbital interaction defined in this work opens up a new way of approaching this problem .",
    "these topics are treated in the following order : first , an introduction to the calculation of von neumann entropies and a definition of the orbital interaction is given in section  [ sec : qit ] , which also contains a recipe for calculating these quantities using expectation values of operators in second quantisation .",
    "section  [ sec : dmrg ] presents the aspects of the dmrg relevant for this work .",
    "subsequently , the orbital interaction is calculated for a set of test molecules in section  [ sec : accuracy ] in order to test the reliability of the proposed method .",
    "section  [ sec : ordering ] then presents results for the ordering problem in the dmrg .",
    "finally , the main findings are summarised in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "it is useful to divide the hilbert space of a quantum - mechanical problem ( the `` universe '' ) into two parts , which we will call the `` system '' and the `` environment '' . if the basis of the system is described by a complete set of states @xmath6 and that of the environment is described by the set @xmath7 , the general wave function @xmath8 can be written as  @xcite @xmath9 with the help of the density operator for a pure state describing the total problem @xmath10 , one can express the reduced density matrix for the system as @xmath11 this is the typical way to set up reduced density matrices .",
    "it requires the partition of the wave function as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wavefunction ] ) as well as the knowledge of the coefficients @xmath12 .",
    "it is also possible , however , to formulate the problem in a different way .",
    "suppose one has another , arbitrary basis for the system , @xmath13 , then @xmath14 with the help of eq .  (",
    "[ eq : wavefunction ] ) one can write @xmath15 where @xmath16 instead of a sum over the coefficients of the wave function , one can calculate the elements of the reduced density matrix with the help of expectation values of the operator @xmath17 .",
    "the effect of @xmath17 is to change the state of the system from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "it can be viewed as a rotation in state space .",
    "after diagonalisation of @xmath20 one obtains its eigenvalues @xmath21 , which define the von neumann entropy of the system  @xcite , @xmath22 this quantity describes how much the system is entangled with the environment for a given wave function @xmath8 .",
    "when the basis @xmath13 describes only one orbital @xmath1 , then the system contains only this orbital @xmath1 and the corresponding entropy @xmath23 is the one - orbital entropy .",
    "if the system contains two orbitals @xmath1 , @xmath2 , then @xmath24 is a two - orbital entropy .",
    "since the two - orbital system is built up from two subsystems , namely , the orbitals @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one can apply the subadditivity property of @xmath3 : @xmath25 where the equality holds when @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not entangled .",
    "the interpretation is straightforward : @xmath23 describes the entanglement of @xmath1 and @xmath26 the entanglement of @xmath2 with the rest of the environment , while @xmath24 describes the entanglement of @xmath1 _ and _ @xmath2 with the rest of the environment .",
    "any entanglement between @xmath1 and @xmath2 reduces @xmath24 with respect to the sum of @xmath23 and @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , one can define the entanglement between two individual orbitals by @xmath27 where the kronecker @xmath28 ensures that @xmath29 , and the factor @xmath30 prevents interactions from being counted twice .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 is interpreted in the remaining part of this work as a measure of the orbital interaction .",
    "although @xmath0 describes the entanglement between two orbitals , it is not possible to use @xmath0 in order to build up entropies of larger systems .",
    "for example , when the system contains the orbitals @xmath1 and the environment the orbitals @xmath2 , then @xmath31 for all cases that we have investigated . the difference can amount to @xmath32% of @xmath33 .      in order to calculate an orbital interaction using eq .",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) , one has to determine and diagonalise the one- and two - orbital reduced density matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "their matrix elements are calculated in this work with the help of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrixelement ] ) , in which the matrix elements are written as expectation values of @xmath17 with respect to the wave function @xmath8 , where the operator changes the state of the system from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "one suitable way to represent the system basis @xmath13 is the occupation - number representation . in particular ,",
    "if the system consists of only one orbital @xmath1 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 are creation and annihilation operators for electrons with spin @xmath38 in the orbital @xmath1 , and @xmath39 is the vacuum state .",
    "( [ eq : one - orbital - basis ] ) leads to a one - orbital density matrix of dimension four . if the system contains two orbitals , then @xmath13 consists of sixteen basis states , where the orbitals @xmath1 and @xmath2 are occupied by zero to four electrons @xmath40 which leads to a @xmath41 two - orbital density matrix .",
    "this representation determines not only the dimension of the resulting density matrices , but has two additional consequences .",
    "the first is that the matrix elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath42 are zero if @xmath43 and @xmath44 differ in the number of electrons or in the z - component of the spin , for example @xmath45 since all of the basis states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one - orbital - basis ] ) differ in either the number of electrons or the z - component of the spin , the one - orbital density matrix is diagonal in this representation , as shown in table [ tab : one - orbital - denmat ] . the second consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : one - orbital - basis ] ) and  ( [ eq : two - orbital - basis ] ) is that the matrix elements @xmath46 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrixelement ] ) can be expressed using creation and annihilation operators .",
    "for example , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ( occupation-)number operator for electrons with spin @xmath38 in the orbital @xmath1 .",
    "we exploit this property in order to determine the one- and two - orbital density matrices .",
    ".the one - orbital density matrix @xmath49 for an orbital @xmath1 . the states @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath51 are defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one - orbital - basis ] ) .",
    "the ( occupation-)number operator for electrons with spin @xmath38 in the orbital @xmath1 is @xmath52 .",

    "two things must be chosen before a dmrg calculation can be carried out : the basis and its ordering on the lattice . in principle ,",
    "any orthonormal basis of orbitals can be used and the ordering is arbitrary .",
    "however , the ordering does affect the convergence of the dmrg in practice  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen by analyzing the behaviour of the energies as @xmath53 is increased . with increasing @xmath53 , the variational nature of the dmrg leads to a decrease in energy for every ordering . for a sufficiently large @xmath53",
    ", the difference to the exact energy can be made arbitrarily small . in this sense",
    "the ordering is arbitrary .",
    "however , the value of @xmath53 that is necessary for a certain accuracy in energy depends on the ordering .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] one can see that the case lif-([eq : sim - an - param-2])-@xmath54 leads to a much lower energy for @xmath55 than lif - hf-@xmath54 . with increasing @xmath53",
    "the energies for lif - hf-@xmath54 improve and for @xmath56 both cases show only a difference in energy of @xmath57  a.u .",
    ", as seen in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "however , the error in the energy in table [ tab : data ] is considerably larger for lif - hf-@xmath54 . in the worst case , it is also possible to find orderings that cause a trapping of the dmrg algorithm in a local minimum  @xcite .",
    "the energy then does not decrease significantly with increasing @xmath53 even though @xmath58 remains small .",
    "it is important to note that this trapping is not necessarily due to a certain ordering but is sometimes caused by an unfavourable choice of parameters for the dmrg calculation .    in order to apply the dmrg to practical situations",
    ", it is therefore crucial to define a criterion for an optimal ordering for a given basis , in order to avoid trapping in local minima and in order to achieve the highest possible accuracy .",
    "the approaches which have been pursued so far have defined an orbital interaction and have ordered the orbitals so that strongly interacting orbitals are near each other on the one - dimensional lattice .",
    "one approach is to define the interaction between orbitals @xmath1 and @xmath2 in terms of the one- and two - electron integrals of the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "improved orderings then reduce the bandwidth of the @xmath59 matrix , for example .",
    "this approach is not able to avoid trapping in local minima  @xcite . in order to find an ordering criterion based on @xmath59 or @xmath60 , a recent study",
    "@xcite has investigated a large number of orderings for the @xmath61 molecule using a genetic algorithm , which has not yet led to a general criterion for different molecules and basis sets .",
    "another approach is to group the orbitals according to their irreducible representations and then order the orbitals within these groups in order to maximise the one - orbital entropy @xmath23 along the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the net effect is that some entangled ( interacting ) orbitals are placed close together but are also somewhat distributed over the lattice .",
    "this is called `` competition between entanglement localisation and interaction localisation '' in ref .",
    "the label `` @xcite '' is attributed to this criterion , which obviously depends on the underlying symmetry of the hf calculation .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath4-@xcite-@xmath62 , @xmath4-@xcite-@xmath54 , and @xmath4-@xcite-@xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2-oers - siteent ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath23 along the lattice is plotted for the three point groups investigated .",
    "the maxima correspond to boundaries between groups of orbitals with the same irreducible representation . for the @xmath64 ordering in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2-oers - siteent](a ) , the sites with large one - orbital entropy are bunched up in the middle of the lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] , we display the effect of these orderings on the convergence of the dmrg : only in the case @xmath65-@xcite-@xmath54 can one see an improvement over the hf ordering @xmath4-hf-@xmath62 .",
    "therefore , one is not guaranteed that a new ordering according to the strategy of ref",
    ".  @xcite leads to improved energy convergence .",
    "a strategy based on the orbital interaction @xmath0 combines the advantages of the two earlier approaches . on the one hand",
    ", one is using the entanglement information of a many - body wave function as in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one has a specific interaction in matrix form as in refs .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 is not sufficiently specific because it only indicates how much orbital @xmath1 interacts with all the other orbitals , while @xmath0 is a direct measure of the interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : interaction ] has also shown that orbitals from the same irreducible representation are coupled strongly .",
    "it is therefore not necessary to account for this fact separately as had to be done in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we search for an improved ordering which localises the interaction @xmath0 , i.e. , reduces the bandwidth of the @xmath0 matrix .",
    "the optimal ordering is found using simulated annealing  @xcite .",
    "we argue that this approach is an improvement over the cuthill - mckee algorithm , used for example in refs .",
    "@xcite , which distinguishes only between occupied and unoccupied matrix elements and thus neglects the information contained in the size of the elements .",
    "the annealing algorithm is comparable to the genetic algorithm  @xcite because both probe different , randomly generated configurations .",
    "the cost function in the annealing process plays a similar role to the fitness function in the genetic algorithm .",
    "following the idea that good orderings should place strongly interacting orbitals near each other , we have investigated several cost functions @xmath66 that all favour orderings in which large elements of @xmath0 are on the secondary diagonal and which have a small bandwidth .",

    "@xcite , we have learned that strongly interacting orbitals should not be bunched up , ( for example , in the middle of the lattice ) but should instead be more evenly distributed .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath70 for elements on the secondary diagonal in regions of length @xmath71 around the edges and the middle of the lattice , where @xmath72 is the number of orbitals , i.e. , @xmath73 an ordering created by the use of eqs .",

    "however , we find that there is no clear correspondence between the value of the cost function for a given ordering and the respective energy convergence .",
    "in other words , small changes in the ordering and the cost function can influence the energy convergence severely .",
    "for example , the case lif-@xcite-@xmath62 has a similar energy convergence as the case lif-([eq : sim - an - param-2])-@xmath62 as shown in table  [ tab : data ] .",

    "[ fig : f2-ipq ] one can not say that one plot of @xmath0 is more compact than the other . despite this similarity , the differences in the energy convergence are as pronounced as for co. only this time the criterion of our work leads to the more exact energy .    to conclude",
    ", we can say that the application of @xmath0 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : simulated - annealing ] ) and  ( [ eq : sim - an - param-2 ] ) leads to an ordering with a considerably better energy convergence than a hf ordering , and the results do not depend on the symmetry used for the underlying hf calculation .",
    "in addition , orderings with a good energy convergence have the following properties : the bandwidth of the @xmath0 matrix is small , large elements @xmath0 are grouped on the secondary diagonal , and pronounced accumulation and scattering of large @xmath0 elements are avoided .",
    "however , we have not been able to establish a distinct correspondence between the orbital interaction and the energy convergence , although @xmath0 is a very reliable quantity .",
    "therefore , one should test a few different orderings determined by varying some of the parameters of the annealing process before one sets up a dmrg calculation aimed at high accuracy .",
    "the resulting energy convergence can be checked for small sizes of the hilbert space .",

    "[ fig : energies ] , where the orderings with the lowest energy for @xmath55 also have the lowest energy for @xmath56 .      evidently , it is desirable to obtain additional insight into the mechanism for energetic convergence in the dmrg .",

    "so far , there has been one attempt to use a localised basis in the dmrg  @xcite that has not , however , led to an improved convergence relative to canonical orbitals .",
    "an obvious choice are natural orbitals , i.e. , the eigenfunctions of the one - particle density matrix ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : one - particle - denmat ] ) ) .",
    "they lead to rapid convergence of the configuration interaction scheme , and should therefore be favourable for the dmrg as well . since the one - particle density matrix is contained in @xmath35 , one can easily construct approximate natural orbitals , for example , from an approximate wave function of a calculation at @xmath55 with hf ordering .",
    "the natural orbitals must also be ordered on the lattice .",
    "one can use an ordering according to occupation number as a reference ordering .",
    "dmrg results for the electronic energies for the four sample molecules calculated with canonical and natural orbitals for various orderings are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nat-200 ] .",
    "one can see that there is a small increase in convergence for the natural orbitals compared to the canonical orbitals in the hf ordering in every case .",

    "[ fig : nat-200 ] ) .",
    "finally , one can consider an iterative improvement of the natural orbitals : beginning with a dmrg calculation using canonical orbitals in hf ordering , one can obtain an improved wave function which can then be used to calculate natural orbitals which in turn can serve as a basis for a next dmrg calculation yielding a wave function with an even lower energy . this procedure can be repeated yielding an improved wave function and energy at every iteration until the energy converges .",
    "we have applied this iterative procedure and have found that the energies decrease only for two or three iterations and then start to fluctuate .",

    "we have developed a cost function for a simulated annealing process that leads to an improved ordering for all of the cases we have treated , i.e. , the subsequent dmrg calculation leads to a lower energy .",
    "we have also found that orderings with a good energy convergence have a small bandwidth in the @xmath0 matrix , and have a distribution of large matrix elements on the secondary diagonal that is relatively uniform along the lattice .",
    "however , we have not been able to identify a consistent scheme that leads to an optimal ordering of the orbitals for the dmrg with this approach .",
    "careful checks and additional attempts to find better orderings are needed .",
    "a more general solution to this problem might lie in the construction of the basis itself .",
    "we have therefore investigated the influence of the use of natural orbitals on the convergence of the dmrg .",
    "this leads to a slight improvement over the use of canonical orbitals , but the ordering problem still remains .",
    "it is known , however , that the dmrg yields excellent results with a basis of @xmath78 orbitals for conjugated polymers .",
    "hence , an optimal basis should consist of orbitals that are localised in real space and are close in energy",
    ". it might then be possible to construct an optimal basis for the dmrg for which the ordering is either obvious or irrelevant .",
    "then the ordering problem should be of minor importance",
