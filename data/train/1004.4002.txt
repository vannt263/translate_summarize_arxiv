    "these long - lived @xcite and ubiquitous objects comprise @xmath11 of all stars , yet their diminutive luminosities ( @xmath12 ) have traditionally prohibited their study in large numbers . however , in recent years , the development of large  format ccds has enabled accurate photometric surveys over wide solid angles on the sky , such as the two  micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "these projects obtained precise ( @xmath13 ) and deep ( @xmath14 ) photometry of large solid angles ( @xmath15 sq@xmath16 deg@xmath16 ) .",
    "the resulting photometric datasets contain millions of low  mass stars , enabling statistical investigations of their properties .",
    "in particular , 2mass photometry led to the discovery of two new spectral classes : l and t @xcite , and was used to trace the structure of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite with m giants .",
    "sdss data led to the discovery the first field methane brown dwarf , which was the coolest substellar object known at the time of its discovery @xcite .",

    "we adopted the mean lf as the observed system lf and proceeded to correct it for the effects of malmquist bias and binarity , as described below .",
    "malmquist bias @xcite arises in flux - limited surveys ( such as sdss ) , when distant stars with brighter absolute magnitudes ( either intrinsically , from the width of the main sequence , or artificially , due to measurement error ) scatter into the survey volume .",

    "the unresolved duo will be over - luminous at a given color , leading to an underestimate of its distance .",
    "this compresses the density maps , leading to decreased scale heights and lengths , as binary systems are assigned smaller distances appropriate to single stars .",
    "currently , the parameter space that describes m dwarf binaries : binary fraction , mass ratio , and average separation , is not well constrained",

    "we introduced binaries into our simulations with four different binary fraction prescriptions .",

    "corrected values are given in table [ table : corrected_gs ] .",
    "the thin disk scale height , which has a strong effect on the derived lf , is in very good agreement with previous values . as the measured thin disk scale height increases , the density gradients decrease , and a smaller local density is needed to explain distant structures",

    "the preferred model thin disk and thick disk scale lengths were found to be similar .",
    "this is most likely due to the limited radial extent of the survey compared to their typical scale lengths .",

    "however , the flattening at lower masses is reproduced if only a fraction of clumps are dense enough to form stars .    an alternative model to turbulent fragmentation is accretion and ejection @xcite . briefly ,",

    "these clumps proceed to accrete nearby gas .",
    "massive stars form near the center of the cloud s gravitational potential , thus having access to a larger gas reservoir .",
    "accretion ends when the nascent gas is consumed or the accreting object is ejected via dynamical interactions .",
    "the characteristic mass is set by the accretion rate and the typical time scale for ejection , with more dense star forming environments producing more low  mass stars .",
    "this method has fallen out of favor recently , as brown dwarfs have been identified in weakly bound binaries @xcite , which should be destroyed if ejection is a dominant mechanism .",
    "furthermore , if ejection is important , the spatial density of brown dwarfs should be higher near the outskirts of a cluster compared to stars , and this is not observed in taurus @xcite or chamaeleon .",
    "@xcite suggested that thermal cooling arguments are also important in star formation .",
    "this argument has gained some popularity , as it predicts a relative insensitivity of the imf to initial conditions , which is supported by many observations .",
    "this insensitivity is due to changes in the cooling rate with density . at low densities",
    ", cooling is controlled by atomic and molecular transitions , while at higher densities , the gas is coupled with dust grains , and these dust grains dominate the cooling .",
    "the result is an equation of state with cooling at low densities and a slight heating term at high densities .",
    "this equation of state serves as a funneling mechanism and imprints a characteristic mass on the star formation process , with little sensitivity to the initial conditions .",
    "the general shape of the imf has been predicted by star formation theories that account for all of these effects @xcite .",
    "in particular , the high mass imf is regulated by the power spectrum of the turbulent flows @xcite and is probably affected by the coagulation of less massive cores , while the flatter , low  mass distribution can be linked to the dispersions in gas density and temperatures . as the imf reported in this study",
    "is an average over the star formation history of the milky way , changes in the characteristic shape of the imf can not be recovered .",
