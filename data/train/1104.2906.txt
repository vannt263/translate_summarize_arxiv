    "previous studies of a variety of different nearby galaxies have been able to probe these sources individually by measuring their spectral characteristics and luminosity variability over many different timescales .",
    "populations of sources can also be scrutinized by the spatial and hardness distributions of sources and their x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) .",
    "@xcite review the x - ray point source populations of numerous , nearby , star - forming galaxies .",
    "one of the most notable is m31 because of its proximity and general similarities to the milky way . because m31 is the closest large spiral galaxy ,",
    "numerous studies have analyzed the x - ray point source populations in great detail with past and current x - ray observatories : _ einstein _",
    "@xcite , _ rosat _",
    "@xcite , _ beppo sax _",
    "@xcite , _ chandra _ @xcite , and _ xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "the two most recent observations with _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , in particular , contain the best data yet , but only in small segments of the galaxy at a time because the spatial extent of the galaxy is much larger than the fields of view of these current x - ray telescopes .    in the last decade ,",
    "the x - ray point source populations of many other nearby , star - forming galaxies have also been scrutinized : late - type spiral galaxies , irregular galaxies , and merging galaxies . not long after the launch of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ space telescopes , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite observed the x - ray point source populations of m74 , m83 and m101 , respectively , all sc - type spiral galaxies .",
    "more recently , the chasem33 survey observed the x - ray point source populations of another sc - type galaxy , m33 @xcite , and @xcite completed a study of the x - ray point source populations of a pair of galaxies , ngc 6946 ( sc - type ) and ngc 4485/4490 ( an irregular galaxy ) .",
    "in addition , in a series of papers , @xcite studied the x - ray point source population in the unique environment of the merging antennae galaxies .",
    "x - ray point source populations from predominantly old stellar populations of early - type galaxies , have also been examined . in the s0 galaxy ,",
    "ngc  1553 , @xcite found that most of the x - ray emission is diffuse , with 49 sources comprising only 30% of the light .",

    "also , @xcite and @xcite analyzed the x - ray point source population of ngc  4472 and found 144 point sources .",

    ", there is evidence for a varying break and varying slopes on either side of the break ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is also evidence for differences between the xlfs of field and cluster binaries @xcite .",
    "particularly prevalent in the x - ray observations of large elliptical galaxies is the large fraction of globular cluster sources ( e.g. , @xmath2 of the sources in ngc  1399 ; * ? ? ?",
    "by matching _",
    "chandra _ and _ hst _ observations , possible trends in the populations can be explored ( e.g. , metallicity ) .    in these many x - ray observations of early- and late - type galaxies ,",
    "these authors inspect the x - ray point sources populations from a variety of perspectives .",
    "hardness ratios are frequently calculated ( albeit in a number of different ways ) .",
    "they are most often used to differentiate populations of sources within each galaxy but have been also used to differentiate galactic sources from background active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the most luminous or most unusual sources in each of the galaxies are typically of particular interest : ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , transient sources , or supersoft sources ( ssss ) .",
    "they are frequently examined in detail in terms of their spectral characteristics and spectral and flux variability .    when x - ray point source populations are inspected using xlfs of different galaxy types and stellar population ages ( i.e. , actively star - forming versus relatively quiescent ) , considerable variation has been observed .",
    "high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) xlfs , which are associated with regions of current star formation , are typically described by straight ( unbroken ) power laws . for simplicity",
    ", we refer to these as  disk - like \" xlfs in this study .",
    "typical cumulative slopes are @xmath30.71.0 for moderate star formation rates ( sfrs ; @xmath4  yr@xmath1 ) and @xmath30.40.5 for higher sfrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "lmxb xlfs or what we refer to as  bulge - dominated \" xlfs in this study are not associated with recent star formation .",
    "these xlfs are typically described by broken or cutoff power laws ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with signs of a flat low - luminosity end and a break or cutoff at a few @xmath5  erg  s@xmath1 , which is frequently attributed to the eddington luminosity for a neutron star .",
    "spiral galaxies ( earlier type , in particular ) show mixed xlfs with contributions from both types of xlfs ,  disk - like \" and  bulge - like \" .",
    "developing physical models to describe the populations of galactic x - ray sources , which are the result of the evolution of their stellar populations , is a daunting task .",
    "some studies have attempted to understand the star formation history of these galaxies through the use of population synthesis modeling .",
    "these complex models attempt to follow the stellar populations through many evolutionary phases to the formation of the x - ray bright systems that we observe @xcite .",
    "there also exist alternate , less complex , methods such as that of @xcite in a previous study of m81 and @xcite , who construct simple birth and death rate models for components of the stellar populations .",
    "however , accurately constructing xlfs to low luminosities and comparing them to models is very difficult ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the information gleaned from doing this ( e.g. , finding and interpreting breaks in xlfs ) can be ambiguous .    some key questions concerning xlfs remain unanswered .",
    "for example , is there a break in the xlfs of spiral galaxies at low fluxes ?",
    "also , essentially every study of these types of x - ray point sources has noted a wide range of levels and timescales of both integrated flux variability and spectral variability .",
    "however , the xlfs of galaxies are almost always characterized by a single x - ray snapshot of the galaxy . a critical question",
    "can then be raised : does the variability of the individual sources significantly manifest itself in a variable xlf ?",
    "in other words , is the xlf robust against the fluctuations of its constituents ?",
    "very large changes in the xlf over the timescales that we are probing , which are much shorter than stellar evolution timescales , should not be observed since this would require correlated variability of many sources .",
    "however , the stability of xlfs has not been thoroughly investigated over the days , weeks , and years timescales .    the nearby sb - type galaxy , m81 , with multiple types of x - ray binaries , is a key object with which to address these points and is an excellent choice for studying the x - ray point source population with _ chandra_. because m81 is relatively nearby at a well - determined distance ( @xmath6  mpc ; @xcite ; using the cepheid period - luminosity relationship ) , we can detect sources with faint luminosities in relatively short exposures and calculate their luminosities accurately .",
    "however , m81 is at a large enough distance so that almost the entire galaxy fits within the field of view of _ chandra _ in one exposure .",
    "these facts make it easy to use _ chandra _ to study the variability characteristics of the x - ray point source population to relatively low luminosities ( @xmath7  erg  s@xmath1 ) in a minimum amount of observations .",
    "m81 s x - ray point source population has been scrutinized many times in the past .",
    "@xcite was the first to study the x - ray point source population of this galaxy with _",
    "einstein _ , but was only able to detect a handful of sources .",
    "later on , @xcite studied this galaxy with _",
    "rosat _ and detected @xmath8 times as many sources to fainter luminosities .",
    "most recently , @xcite and @xcite found 177 sources with _",
    "chandra _ in a single exposure , 1727 of which are expected to be background agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . out of these galactic sources ,",
    "some are expected to be snrs , ulxs , ssss , or young pulsars / pulsar wind nebulae , but most are likely lmxbs and hmxbs .",
    "we seek to follow - up the work of @xcite and @xcite and to add to the understanding of the characteristics of the x - ray point sources and xlfs of nearby galaxies by carrying out an observational study of the nearby galaxy m81 .",
    "we use a set of sixteen _ chandra _ observations of m81 that explore variability on timescales of days , weeks , and years .",
    "we also use these observations to make the most complete study of m81 s x - ray point source population to date .    in   [ section : obs_red ]",

    "for all of our analyses throughout this work , we use the energy range of 0.58.0 kev ( e.g. , fluxes , luminosities ) , unless otherwise noted .",
    "we present fifteen _ chandra _ observations of m81 ( obsids  5935 - 5949 ) taken specifically to explore xlf and individual point source variability . for our analysis , we include an additional observation from the _ chandra _ archive ( obsid  735 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to provide a longer baseline for measuring variability ( see table  [ table : obsinfo ] ) .",
    "all sixteen observations were taken with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; @xcite ) in timed exposure mode with a frame time of 3.2 s and the aimpoint on the default location of the s3 chip .",
    "the data were telemetered to the ground in faint mode .",
    "we analyze all of these observations using the ciao software provided by the chandra x - ray center as well as the idl - based acis extract program version 2008 - 03 - 04 ( ae ; @xcite ) .",
    "we ignore the acis - i chips for the entire analysis for three primary reasons : 1 ) the observations were purposely taken to line - up the galaxy on the acis - s chips so that any sources found on the acis - i chips are far less - likely to be associated with m81 ; 2 ) point source extractions for sources on chips i2 or i3 become very difficult because the caldb psf library that this version of ae uses for automated spectral extraction does not contain the appropriate psfs ; and 3 ) the psf quickly becomes impractically large there .",

    "we changed the wcs header information to account for these tiny offsets .",
    "then , for all 16 observations , we reprocessed the level=1 event files with ciao 4.0 following the threads on the _ chandra _ x - ray center website to apply the most - recent calibration updates available ( caldb version 3.5.0 ) .",

    "we inspected the total background for each observation and found background flares in obsids 5936 , 5945 , 5946 , and 5947 .",
    "these flares will not affect our point source extractions ( although they do affect our background model selection ) because we always include a local background when fitting each source s spectrum .",
    "therefore , we did not exclude the time intervals of the flares in our observations .",
    "we also constructed a coadded observation of obsids 59355949 .",
    "we used the  merge_all \" ciao contributed script to coadd the event files and exposure maps for source detection and for the creation of figure  [ fig:3color ] .",
    "any other coadded source information was calculated for each observation with ae and then merged with ae s merge_observations step , which properly takes into account observation - to - observation instrumental details ( i.e. , weighting the data products appropriately ) .",
    "we refer to information gleaned from the combination of obsids 59355949 as the  merged \" observation information throughout this work .",
    "we used wavdetect @xcite , ciao s wavelet source detection algorithm to search for sources in all of the individual observations as well our merged observation .",
    "it was not appropriate to include obsid 735 in the merged observation for source detection because the aimpoint of this observation ( very near to sn  1993j ) is @xmath12  arcmin southwest of the aimpoint of obsids 59355949 ( very near the center of the galaxy ) .",
    "this means that the size and shape of the psf is different in the same sections of the galaxy between obsids 59355949 and 735 , which would lead to less - efficient source detections .",
    "we first filtered the obsids to 0.56.0 kev to minimize noise .",
    "then , we consistently searched for point sources on a chip - by - chip basis since the size and shape of the psf changes as a function of off - axis angle .",
    "we used the default settings for the wavdetect parameters , where applicable ( notably , the significance threshold , ",
    "sig_thresh \" , was @xmath13 , which corresponds to approximately one spurious source per acis chip ) , except for the scales parameter .",
    "we searched a variety of spatial scales in a @xmath14 series ( as suggested in the wavdetect manual ) using different upper and lower bounds for each chip .",
    "we searched scales of 28 pixels on s3 , 216 pixels on s2 , 634 pixels on s4 , and 14 - 40 pixels on s1 .",
    "there were a number of complications that arose when constructing our master source list :    1 .   while matching sources between observations in crowded subfields at large off - axis angles , it was not always initially clear whether the apparently matched source was actually the same source or whether we were confusing multiple nearby sources .",
    "this is because the position uncertainty far off axis can be quite large , especially when the source is near the detection limit .",
    "furthermore , source variability can cause some sources to become particularly dim or drop below the detection threshold in certain observations . as a remedy for most of the sources in this category , we considered two detected sources as one if their extraction regions , which enclose the inner 50% of the psf , overlapped .",
    "2 .   for a few sources at intermediate off - axis angles ,",
    "psf substructure also caused very close double source detections .",
    "careful inspection of the psfs for these few sources revealed that wavdetect finds two sources in one complicated psf ( see @xcite , who provide details about this problem in their analysis for the champ survey ) .",
    "while it is possible that , in these cases , the double sources are real , it is very unlikely and , following our rule in step 1 .",
    ", we would not be able to separate them anyway if they were real .",
    "3 .   a considerable readout streak from m81 * , the agn in the low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) in the center of the galaxy , was present in all 16 observations , most significantly obsid  735 , causing wavdetect to find many false sources .",
    "we exclude m81 * from our source lists .",
    "sources on the readout streaks were considered real only if they were detected in multiple observations .",
    "we were able to make this cut since the read streak changed position on the sky with the changing roll angle of the telescope .",
    "4 .   obvious false detections , which include sources with only 12 counts were rejected .",
    "one false detection is expected per chip with the default wavdetect settings that we used .",
    "the background in the center of m81 due to the wings of the psf of m81 * , unresolved galactic point sources , and diffuse galactic emission was non - uniform , quite high , and varied slightly in intensity in different positions on the chips , which made it difficult to detect sources . in this case , we used maximum likelihood reconstructions ( constructed with multiple iterations of idl s  max_likelihood \" routine  implemented with ae ) of the region near m81*. six additional sources and a severe surface brightness depression caused by pileup effects were detected in the neighborhood of m81*. since these sources were embedded very near to this piled - up region and in a highly sloped background from a combination of wings of the psf of m81 * and m81 s galactic background , we do not include these sources in our master or borderline source lists ( see below ) .",
    "because of these complications , we were only able to reliably extract the wavdetect positions for these sources , which we list in table  [ table : ml_sources ] .",

    ".   we made one final cut on our preliminary source list using the ae s prob_no_source statistic , which estimates whether a source is real by sampling the binomial probability distribution .",
    "we kept only sources at the 99.9% probability level of being real according to this statistic .",
    "our final source list contains 265 sources which are listed in ancillary tables .",
    "we also include list of sources at the 9999.9% probability level according to the prob_no_source statistic and deem these 11 sources  borderline sources \" ( referred to as b1-b11 ) .",
    "note that only coordinates are listed for three sources in the master source list and two sources in the borderline source list because they were only in the field of view ( on chip ) of obsid 735 : 234 , 241 , 262 , b8 , and b9 .",
    "overall , this careful multiple - step approach to refining our master source list rejected @xmath15 of the original wavdetect sources as false detections .",
    "finally , we note that using the _ chandra _ point - source catalog ( csc ) to construct source lists for m81 for simplicity is tempting , but would yield incomplete results .",
    "the current source list from the csc contains @xmath16 of sources that we found in the galaxy through our more careful searching .",
    "such a disparate result can be explained by the differences in how we and the csc make use of wavdetect for the construction of our source lists ( our numbered procedure above is very different than the csc s procedures ) .",
    "for example , the csc uses different : wavelet scales , energy filtering , blocking , and significance thresholds .",
    "the most important difference to the overall process is that we have stacked our 15 new observations , revealing a multitude of additional , faint sources .",
    "we used ae for the extraction of the source and background spectra .",
    "one of the primary reasons that we use ae ( as opposed to other ciao tools such as psextract ) is that ae calculates the size , shape , and position of each extraction region , and it calculates the auxiliary response file ( arf ) taking into account the psf fraction enclosed in the region as a function of energy .",
    "we also use ae to refine the positions beyond the initial wavdetect estimates and calculate some useful statistics and photometry .",
    "we briefly lay out the point source extraction process here .",
    "first , we constructed regions to match the psf retreived from the caldb library and that enclose a prescribed percentage of the psf ( 90% default unless it needed to be adjusted to as low as 50% for nearby sources relative to the size of the psf ) .",
    "then for each point source , we extracted the source events within the psf - matched region and a representative background in an annular region centered on the point source .    with this information ,",
    "ae then provides new position estimates for each of the sources .",
    "we refined the positions of the sources according to the prescriptions in the ae manual .",
    "for sources that were @xmath17 from the aimpoint , we used the mean event position , and , for sources that were @xmath18 from the aimpoint , we used the correlation position .",
    "the latter position is calculated automatically by ae , by correlating the neighborhood around the source ( not just the extracted counts ) with the source s psf .",
    "since the positions of some of the sources ( especially the fainter ones ) take time to converge , we ran these first few steps a minimum of 5 times .",
    "this provides us with very accurate source positions , useful for comparing to observations taken with other telescopes and provides accurate flux estimates .",
    "lastly , we extracted the spectra for each source and its local background , which included the creation of the arf and rmf ( redistribution matrix file ) files for fitting the spectra .",
    "ae implements rules so that the background is always well - constrained . at minimum",
    ", the background spectrum must always have at least 100 counts and a ratio of the photometric errors of the source to background of at least 4.0 ( so that the error in the background does not dominate the total error ) .",
    "these constraints on the background extraction yielded a median background radius of 76 sky pixels with @xmath19 of the sources having radii less than @xmath20 sky pixels and @xmath21 of the sources farthest off - axis having radii of @xmath20500 sky pixels .",
    "to estimate the energy fluxes and other source properties , we fit the source and background spectrum of each source in each observation ( @xmath22 spectra , most fit using automated methods detailed below ) .",
    "we tested an alternate method of estimating fluxes by using a single count - rate - to - flux conversion factor .",
    "we found that this would have led us to calculate different source fluxes by factors of order unity or less ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : conv_factor ] ; see also ",
    "[ section : comp_m81_m31 ] for a brief discussion of this effect with regard to the xlfs ) .",
    "we jointly fit the unbinned source and background spectrum of each source in each observation in sherpa @xcite using the c - statistic , which is similar to the @xcite statistic but with an approximate goodness - of - fit measure , and the powell minimization algorithm .    since almost all of the sources have too few counts to constrain many of their source properties and since we are mainly interested in estimating accurate fluxes , we began by fitting the source and background spectra for each source in each observation with absorbed power - law models ( xswabs @xmath23 xspowerlaw ) .",
    "we initially used the default parameter boundaries ( xswabs.nh=[0.01,10 ] ( @xmath24 @xmath25 ) , xspowerlaw.phoindx=[-3,10 ] , xspowerlaw.norm is estimated from the data ) in sherpa in all cases except one .",
    "we always constrained the hydrogen column density to be at least that of the milky way in the direction of m81 , @xmath26 @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "since degeneracies in the fit parameters will frequently arise for very faint sources , we followed a specialized scheme for these sources based on the number of counts in the source extraction region .",
    "if we extracted less than 5 counts ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) for a source , the power - law index and the hydrogen column density for the fit were frozen to 1.7 and the galactic value , respectively .",
    "if we extracted more than 5 but less than 26 counts ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) , we froze only the power - law index to 1.7 and let the hydrogen column density float , although , in this case , it was always poorly constrained . for all other sources with more than 26 counts ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) , we allowed all fit parameters to float .    following these rules",
    ", we obtained reasonable fits for most of the sources .",
    "however , some of the individual - observation source spectra ( @xmath27 ) , did not have acceptable fits using these rules alone .",
    "first , the background spectra were not always well - fit by a single absorbed power - law model .",
    "the merged spectra revealed that , when well - sampled , background spectra were always quite complicated .",
    "these complications exhibited themselves sometimes in the individual observation source spectra . for the cases where the reduced background goodness of fit statistic was @xmath28 . ] , a more complicated background model , two power laws and a blackbody ( xswabs @xmath23 ( xspowerlaw @xmath29 xspowerlaw @xmath29 xsbbody ) ) was used to achieve a good fit .",
    "this ad hoc combination of models is only used to model the shape of the background spectra .",
    "second , there were some sources ( @xmath30% of the fits ) in which the best - fit hydrogen column density of the source was found at the maximum of the parameter space , @xmath31 @xmath25 . since the simple absorption model does not account for multiple photon scatterings through a compton - thick medium and we did not consider other absorption models for our spectral fitting , we refit the spectra using a maximum hydrogen column density of @xmath32 @xmath25 , which allowed for reasonable spectral fits for most of these sources . however , there were still a small subset of sources ( @xmath33% of the fits ) with 525  counts where the best - fit hydrogen column densities were at @xmath32 @xmath25 .",
    "for these few sources , we allowed the power - law photon index , @xmath34 , to float .",
    "this led to resonable fits for these sources .",
    "third , there were sources with best - fit power - law indices up to 10 , the maximum parameter space boundary .",
    "for these soft sources with @xmath35 ( @xmath36% ) , we changed the source model to a simple thermal ( xsbbody ) model and achieved good fits ( c - statistic @xmath37 with kt @xmath38 1 kev ) .",
    "our change in spectral model here does not imply that there are not sources that could be well - fit by this model with temperatures in excess of 1  kev .",
    "given the limited number of source counts for most sources , we expect that such sources were well - fit by the absorbed power - law model .",
    "this only implies that there were sources that could not be well - fit by the absorbed power - law model within a reasonable range of photon indices because their spectra were too soft .",
    "this result indicates that we can not differentiate these models for most of our sources that are not very soft .",
    "this is acceptable since our goal is not to differentiate source models .",
    "these comments also apply to the merged spectra that are mentioned below .",
    "fourth , a very small number of sources ( @xmath33% ) had @xmath39 or had spectra such that sherpa could not find a reasonable local minimum and frequently ran into parameter space boundaries .",
    "these were generally sources that had only a few counts , and were located in regions where the background spectrum was complicated . in these cases ,",
    "the software had to be manually guided until a reasonable fit was found .    in summary",
    ", we allowed for fairly liberal upper and lower bounds for the fit parameters because there are a wide range of different types of sources in our sample ( e.g. , lmxbs , hmxbs , snrs , ssss , ulxs , background agn , etc . ) .",
    "after considerable experimentation and iteration , the following constraints were imposed on our spectral fitting process :    1 .   we required the reduced goodness of fit statistic for the source to be better than 1.2 .",
    "we required the reduced goodness of fit statistic for the background to be better than 0.9 for sources within 7  arcmin of the aimpoint and better than 1.4 for sources farther off - axis than 7  arcmin .",
    "3 .   the source absorption , n@xmath40 , must be less than @xmath32  @xmath25 ( the compton - thick limit ) .",
    "4 .   no sources can be very near to or stuck at parameter space boundaries .",
    "the source power - law fits can not have a photon index greater than 3 or less than 0 .",
    "the blackbody ( thermal ) fits were specifically implemented only for very soft sources and do not have kt greater than 1  kev .    at the end of the fitting process ,",
    "all fits abided by these rules .",
    "out of all source fits in each of the 16 observations , two sources in obsid 735 required special attention with the use of more complicated models .",
    "first , the brightest ulx ( source 21 ) was the only source that suffered from significant pileup and , therefore , sherpa s jd pileup model @xcite was used in addition to the power - law fit .",
    "the second source , sn1993j ( the aim of obsid 735 ) , was fit by two low - temperature absorbed thermal emission - line ( vmekal ) components . since care has already been taken in fitting these sources @xcite , we used these models .",
    "we also fit the source spectra of obsids 59355949 , the merged observation , to better understand the properties of each source .",
    "we did not include the obsid 735 in the merged spectra because the arf changes significantly and there appears to be spectral variability in at least a few sources ( see   [ section : spectral_var ] ) .",
    "we fit the merged source spectra with simple absorbed power - law models as above .",
    "we found that 219 of the 262 sources were well - fit by this method ( cstat  @xmath41  1 ) .",
    "again , two sources ( the brightest ulx and sn1993j ) were fit with special models , as described in the previous paragraph .",
    "the remaining sources were better fit by simple blackbody ( thermal ) models .",
    "almost all of the sources better fit with the simple thermal model also had hardness ratios indicative of thermal snr or sss populations ( see   [ section : hr ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "the background was poorly fit by a single absorbed power law .",
    "we used the more complicated background model expressed above , which achieved good fits .",
    "fit parameter distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : fit_dist ] .",
    "there appears to be no correlation between the net counts and the blackbody temperature for the softest sources , although there is a lower cutoff in the blackbody temperature , which is likely due to the dropoff in sensitivity of chandra at lower energies and foreground absorption .",
    "the distribution of photon indices can almost entirely be accounted for by the uncertainties in the photon indices ( @xmath42 within @xmath43 of the mean ) with a natural width of 0.32 to the distribution .    for each source in the master and borderline source lists ,",
    "we compile one table for our merged source photometry and another for our merged spectral fits , which are both ancillary tables .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate hardness ratios using the ae pipeline for the sources in our master source list ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) from the background - subtracted counts of the merged observation in different bands ( h : 28 kev ; m : 12 kev ; s : 0.51 kev , t : 0.58 kev ) .",
    "since most of the sources have far too few counts to make significant statements about the source properties , we use these hardness ratios to estimate the spectral properties of the differing source populations in this dataset .",
    "the population of sources shows the full range of expected colors as seen in fig .",

    "this classification is based on the general characteristics of the hmxb and lmxb populations in our galaxy .",
    "the former are predominantly pulsar x - ray binaries and hence have hard spectra , while the latter host either black holes or low - magnetic field neutron stars resulting in softer spectra ( at least at the luminosities that we are probing with these observations ) .",
    "hmxbs with black - holes could also be in the same locus but , in our galaxy , these are substantially rarer than lmxbs . given the similarity of m81 with our galaxy , we would also expect that the vast majority of the objects in this locus are lmxbs . as was emphasized in @xcite ,",
    "the color of an individual source calculated in this fashion is not sufficient to determine the precise nature of the source .",
    "instead , this color classification scheme is useful primarily for population studies , and we take advantage of this fact in the next section .",
    "further insight into the multi - wavelength properties of these sources requires detailed source matching with additional observations ( e.g. , optical observations ) , which is beyond the scope of this study . as a result",
    ", we can not individually identify background agn apart from galactic source populations in m81 at the present time .",
    "to varying degrees , this sometimes limits the interpretation of our : color - color analysis in this section , variability analysis in   [ section : indiv_src_var ] , and interpretation and comparisons of the disk xlfs ( mainly for the outer disk ;   [ section : xlfs ] ) . also ,",
    "because of this and the fact that our monitoring observations mainly focus on the bulge and inner disk regions , we do not perform a spatial correlation analysis between the positions of the sources in m81 to the spiral arms of m81 , which has been previously done @xcite .",
    "some of these tasks will be carried out in a future publication that will include detailed source matching with the deepest _",

    "image to date ( zezas et al . in prep . ) . despite these current limitations",
    ", we do carry out interesting spatial , variability , and xlf analysis in the later sections .      in order to search for trends in the nature of x - ray point sources in nearby galaxies ,",
    "it is common practice to divide them into two primary groups , bulge sources and disk sources .",
    "however , in any disk galaxy , such a clear division almost never exists because the stellar populations rarely are isolated from one another ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "m81 is an early - type , spiral galaxy with a considerable , predominantly old stellar population in the bulge that blends into the inner parts of the disk .",
    "the inclination of m81 ( @xmath44 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) exacerbates the blended appearance .",
    "nevertheless , previous works have attempted to define a single separation between the bulge and the disk of this galaxy .",
    "for example , in the analysis of obsid 735 , @xcite defined the separation of the bulge and the disk roughly based on the morphology of the galaxy ( a @xmath45 arcmin ellipse with a major axis position angle of 149 degrees ) .",
    "later , in the more detailed study of this dataset , @xcite chose a larger , physically - motivated separation between the bulge and disk of the galaxy using the inner lindblad resonance ( a @xmath46 arcmin ellipse with the same position angle ) .",
    "however , these are just two examples of how one can separate these regions , and there are many other ways that this can be done .",
    "for instance , @xmath47-band or @xmath48 isophotal fits or @xmath49 color changes all yield different results ( jay gallagher  private communication ) .    we propose to separate the bulge and disk in a different way than listed above by taking advantage of the classification scheme laid out by @xcite",
    ". we can use this diagram as a guide to separate the bulge and disk of this galaxy since certain populations of sources tend to be more strongly - associated with different parts of the galaxy . for example , although we expect to find lmxbs in all regions of the galaxy , we expect a large fraction of the sources in the bulge region to be lmxbs since older stellar populations dominate here . also , we expect to see very few or no hmxbs or snrs in the bulge region since these sources should only be found in regions of active star formation , primarily the disk .    by taking different inclination - corrected radial cuts",
    ", we can find at which radius sources with colors consistent with lmxbs and hmxbs dominate or when they are hardly present at all . following this technique ,",
    "we define the  bulge \" to include all sources inside a @xmath50 arcmin ellipse at a position angle of 149 degrees with respect to the major axis , which is slightly smaller than the morphology - based definition in @xcite .",
    "we define the  outer disk \" to be all sources outside a @xmath51 arcmin ellipse with the same position angle , but within the hatched regions of fig .",
    "[ fig : outline ] ( @xmath52  arcmin@xmath53 ) , which is closer to but considerably larger than the disk as defined in @xcite , based on the inner lindblad resonsance .",
    "this method leaves an undetermined inclination - corrected annular region of the galaxy , which we refer to as the  inner disk \" region .",
    "this region includes sources from all sections of the color - color plot and is consistent with the properties of both the bulge and the disk of the galaxy .",
    "the apparent properties of the incompleteness - corrected xlfs are also consistent with the properties of both the bulge and the disk of the galaxy , although the fits suggest that the xlf is very disk - like (   [ section : xlfs ] ) .",
    "since one of the primary goals of this study is to test the significance of source variability on the xlfs , we need to first estimate the level of variability that we can detect in the individual source population .",
    "we parameterize individual source variability by comparing the difference in luminosity for each source in each observation with its corresponding uncertainties .",
    "since we probe different timescales , we parameterize the variability in two ways .    first ,",
    "for each source , we calculate the significance statistic between each of the individual obsids 59355949 , which probes the days  weeks timescales .",
    "we use the same variability parameterization as in @xcite :    @xmath54    where the fluxes ( @xmath55 ) were calculated as described in   [ section : source_lists  spectral_fitting ] .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the flux ( @xmath56 ) from the 90% confidence interval in the counts @xcite , and then take the average of the uneven poisson uncertainties to form a single uncertainty as required by equation  .",
    "second , we calculate the significance statistic on the 5-year timescale by comparing the weighted average fluxes and appropriately propagated uncertainties of the merged observation to the fluxes in obsid  735 using equation  .",
    "we consider sources with @xmath57 to have significant variability . for sources that are in the field of view of all observations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : src_coverage ] ) , we find that 16% of them exhibit significant variability on the days  weeks timescales and 25% of the sources exhibit significant variability on the 5-year timescale .",
    "for some sources , we find considerable variability as much as approximately an order of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "however , we likely have missed substantial variations in some sources , especially some of the fainter ones , because of limited signal - to - noise and how we search for variability .",
    "thus , the fraction of the population that we measure as variable is a lower limit .",
    "we plot light curves of the 6 sources with the strongest variability in either of the two different timescales ( @xmath58 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : indiv_var ] ) . in these 6 most extreme cases",
    ", the most significant variability always occurs on the 5-year timescale ( at least in part due to the smaller errors in the luminosities associated with this timescale comparison ) .",
    "in addition , all of these sources have colors in fig .  [",
    "fig : hr ] consistent with lmxbs and hmxbs ( ( h - m)/t@xmath590.0 and ( m - s)/t = 0.00.5 ) except for source number 96 , which is consistent with a sss .    for the remainder of the variable sources , we see a wide range in the level and timescale of variability . however , there appear to be groups of sources with similar variability characteristics .",
    "for instance , there is a group of sources ( @xmath60 ) that have luminosities on the order of a few times 10@xmath61  erg  s@xmath1 or less for most of the observations , but that brighten by about an order of magnitude over 1 - 3 observations or a timescale of a few days . in particular , six of these sources , which all have colors consistent with hmxbs , brighten by a factor of 530 over one of obsids  5935 - 5949 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "one of these sources is in the outer disk region and five are in the inner disk region .",
    "sources undergoing an outburst like these could be population of massive star transient sources ( e.g. , be star binaries ) like those in the magellanic clouds and our galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also tested for spectral variability by constructing the same variability statistic as in equation   for the column density and power - law index or blackbody temperature .",
    "the fluxes in this equation are replaced by the best - fit values of these parameters and the flux uncertainties are replaced by the uncertainties from the spectral fits .    in the master source list , significant spectral variability based on the column density",
    "was found for only one source , number 21 ( the brightest source and ulx ) .",
    "the variability was found only for the comparison of the merged observation and obsid 735 for the 5-year timescale .",
    "significant spectral variability based on the power - law index was found for only four sources : 5 , 6 , 19 , 22 .",
    "the most significant variability for sources 5 and 22 occurs on the days  weeks timescale and , for sources 6 and 19 , occurs on the 5-year timescale between single observations .",
    "there were no sources with significant variability in the blackbody temperature .",
    "all of these sources have colors consistent with lmxbs and hmxbs ( ( h - m)/t@xmath630.0 and ( m - s)/t = 0.10.6 ) .",
    "detecting significant spectral variability in only a few cases is not unexpected given the very low signal - to - noise ratio for most sources in the individual observations . finally ,",

    "the source detection threshold is not consistent over the entire field of view of each of the observations or the merged observation because of a variety of instrumental and statistical effects ( e.g. , varying psf size and shape , effective detector area , etc . ) .",
    "this leads us to detect only a fraction of sources at lower luminosities , and , as a result , any xlf that we construct near the detection threshold of our observations will be shallower due to incompleteness .",
    "therefore , we correct all of our xlfs for incompleteness using the methods in @xcite before any comparisons and fits are attempted .    in brief , the detection probability of a source is calculated for multiple background levels and off - axis angles from grids of marx simulations @xcite . then , on a source - by - source basis , we interpolate between these grids to estimate the detection probability and , hence , the incompleteness correction factor to be applied to each source in each xlf .",

    "each source must to have either more than 8.25 source counts and an off - axis angle less than 7 arcminutes or more than 15 source counts and an off - axis angle less than 9.5 arcminutes , depending on which region of the galaxy it resides .",
    "beyond 9.5 arcminutes , the incompleteness correction for almost any luminosity included in our source list is exceedingly large . at count cutoffs greater than 15 counts",

    "we took care to uniformly impose our off - axis angle and count limits across all observations , so that if a source fails to meet our criteria in one observation , the same source was rejected in all other observations .",
    "this is very important so that when we compare our xlfs , any differences in the xlfs are from source variability alone , not source rejection .",

    "can this individual source variability impart significant varibility to the xlfs ?",
    "we directly test this hypothesis .    when comparing our corrected xlfs , we used a non - parametric statistical test , the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test @xcite .",
    "we also arrived at the same conclusions as below for the k - s test when testing the uncorrected xlfs with the kruskall - wallis ( k - w ) @xcite and mann - whitney ( m - w ) tests @xcite .",
    "helpful detailed explanations of these and other similar statistical tests can be found in @xcite .",
    "the k - s test is useful because it could be applied to the incompleteness - corrected xlfs .",
    "we tested our xlfs for consistency by making pairwise comparisons of the xlfs using a two - sided k - s test , which indicates how likely it is that the two xlfs were drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "a k - s statistic near 0 indicates that two data sets were not drawn from the same parent distribution .    to test the xlfs for consistency , we considered two different timescale comparisons separately , a timescale of days  weeks ( obsids 59355949 ) and a timescale of @xmath8 years ( obsids 59355949 to 735 and merged to obsid 735 ) . in doing so , we also compared the xlfs in each of our different fields of view separately ( entire galaxy , bulge , inner disk and outer disk regions ) .",
    "in addition , we test for the possibility that differences in the merged and individual xlfs arise because of differences in individual source luminosities in a snapshot versus the average luminosity ( see section 4.1 of * ? ? ? * ) . upon inspecting the distributions of these k - s significance statistics ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ks_dist ] and [ fig : ks_dist_merged ] ) , we find that , although most of the k - s statistics are near 1 for all regions of the galaxy , some of them are near 0",

    ". the intrinsic variability of the individual m81 sources on these timescales does not make the xlfs inconsistent with each other , suggesting that a snapshot survey provides a reliable indicator of the xlf .",
    "parameterizing the xlfs is useful for comparing our xlfs to xlfs in other galaxies and those created by synthesis models .",
    "therefore , we fit the differential xlfs with simple and modified power - law functions .",
    "there are a number of methods that can be used to fit a differential number of points in an unbiased way : maximum likelihood methods ( @xcite , @xcite ) , a method using the k - s test @xcite , or methods using x - ray spectral fitting software ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we choose to use the method utilizing x - ray spectral fitting software because it is convenient and has been shown to yield consistent results with a maximum likelihood method ( see * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , we can implement the incompleteness correction through an arf that scales the differential number of sources for the fitting .",
    "because of our large dynamic range for fitting ( @xmath66@xmath67  erg  s@xmath1 ) , we rebin the xlf and arf in counts space to six - count bins as opposed to a  natural \" binning scheme of one - count bins .",

    "however , foreground absorption of m81 brings about an uncertainty in the agn flux distribution .",

    "the break luminosity is poorly constrained but is within a factor of a few of the eddington luminosity of a neutron star and is consistent with the values derived from other previous work for elliptical and s0 galaxies , the bulges of other galaxies , and the lmxbs of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "we also see evidence of the flattening of the lmxb xlf below @xmath0  erg  s@xmath1 that has been seen by many of these previous studies .",
    "the best fit functions with the agn model are @xmath112 for the broken power law , where l@xmath113 and @xmath114 for the power law with an exponential cutoff , where l@xmath115 .",
    "the shape of this xlf together with the locations of the sources in the color - color plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) suggests a very old population of stars dominates the innermost part of m81 and that we are probing a population of mostly lmxbs .",
    "the shape of the xlf is also consistent with the overall shape of the average lmxb xlf , which has a flat cumulative distribution below a few times @xmath70  erg  s@xmath1 with a cutoff near a few times @xmath116  erg  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the agn do not strongly bias these results as they are expected to comprise @xmath117 of the sources in the xlf above the cutoff luminosity , @xmath66  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "next , because of the very large percentage of agn expected in the outer disk xlf ( @xmath118 of the sources above the cutoff luminosity and @xmath119 of the sources above @xmath70  erg  s@xmath1 ) , this region is the most difficult to interpret .",
    "this region also has the fewest total number of sources , and brief inspection of some all - sky optical surveys suggests that there are also a few foreground stars , which we have not attempted to remove .",
    "while there appears to be a break near @xmath70  erg  s@xmath1 , it does not bring about a significant improvement in the fit when the agn contribution is taken into account ( 94% confidence , @xmath120 ) .",
    "therefore , we fit this xlf with a single , unbroken power law as is typically seen in disk - like regions of ongoing star formation as in the disk xlf of our galaxy @xcite , the antennae @xcite , and ngc 6946 @xcite , for examples .",
    "the best - fit function with the agn model is @xmath121 with a much shallower slope than what has been found in the studies above and which produces an unusual - looking fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xlfs_merged ] ) .",
    "however , the best - fit function without the agn model is @xmath122 with a slope that is more consistent with the other disk studies above",
    ". the slope can not be well - constrained and , given the large fit uncertainties ( the errors for the slopes are on the order of the range of slopes found with or without the agn model ) , we do not attempt to interpret this xlf further .    our inner disk region xlf is consistent with a single , unbroken power law and a broken power law does not result in a significant improvement in the fit ( 44% confidence , @xmath123 ) .",
    "the best - fit function with the agn model is @xmath124 inspection of the color - color plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) indicates that there are a population of lmxbs in this region ( or hmxbs with black holes that have very similar colors ) that are embedded with the hmxbs and other sources ( this is also where the ulxs and a few snrs are ) .",
    "while visual inspection of figure  [ fig : xlfs_merged ] may suggest that this xlf has a break , the fits indicate that it is not significant .",
    "furthermore , the best - fit power - law slope and the fact that well - pronounced spiral arms are present , combined with an inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] , supports the notion that this xlf appears very disk - like and that a large fraction of the sources in this region are hmxbs .",
    "the agn make a moderate contribution to the sources in the xlf here ( @xmath125 of the sources above the cutoff luminosity ) and do change the slope and normalization of the best - fit model when taken into account .",
    "however , whether we take into account the agn contribution or not , a single power law is strongly favored and the best - fit slopes in either case are consistent with each other .    a global view of x - ray point source population is revealed in the total xlf . there is a marginal improvement in the fit from the single to the broken power law ( 97% confidence , @xmath126 ) with a break near @xmath70  erg  s@xmath1 , which could be the break in the bulge manifesting itself at a slightly lower luminosity than measured in the bulge .",
    "the best - fit function with the agn model is @xmath127 where l@xmath128 and without the agn model is @xmath129 where l@xmath128 .",
    "the slopes with or without the agn model are fairly shallow and resemble the xlf slope of the inner disk region of m81 and disk regions in other galaxies where there is considerable star formation occurring . however , because this xlf does also have a significant break and the color - color plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) suggests contributions from many different populations of sources , we conclude that this xlf is neither disk- nor bulge - dominated , but is a fairly even mixture of both types .",
    "finally , we can use our xlfs to estimate two interesting galactic properties : the stellar mass and the sfr , using relationships in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "first , to estimate the total stellar mass of m81 , we need to estimate the number of lmxbs in m81 with l@xmath130  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "since we have found that the bulge is likely almost exclusively composed of lmxbs , we use our bulge xlf to estimate that there are @xmath60 lmxbs in this range . as we have stated above",
    ", we also expect there to be a population of lmxbs in the disk regions as well , especially in the inner disk region .",
    "the fraction of lmxbs can be estimated from our color - color plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) but is very uncertain . taking this fraction and applying it to our xlf in this luminosity range , we estimate that there are @xmath131 lmxbs in this region .",
    "the outer disk region appears to contribute only a very small amount of lmxbs with l@xmath130  erg  s@xmath1 when the expected agn fraction is taken into account , so we do not include it here .    then using these numbers together with equation 20 in @xcite",
    ", we estimate that the total stellar mass of m81 is @xmath132  m@xmath133 .",
    "this is a fairly robust lower limit to the number lmxbs in m81 because : we have neglected the outer disk contribution , the k - band light is measured out to larger radii than our x - ray data , there are some sources superimposed against the liner nucleus that we are unable to detect or classify ( some of these are the ml sources in table  [ table : ml_sources ] ) , and equation 21 suggests a larger mass .",
    "we also estimate the total stellar mass of m81 using the total 2mass k - band magnitude , @xmath134  mag .",
    "this corresponds to a solar k - band luminosity of @xmath135  l@xmath133 . using m@xmath136/l@xmath137 from galev models for an saab - type galaxy @xcite",
    ", we estimate a total stellar mass of @xmath138  m@xmath133 . reversing the calculation ,",
    "this stellar mass suggests that m81 has @xmath139120 lmxbs with l@xmath130  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "part of this discrepancy can be attributed to the reasons listed at the end of the previous paragraph .",
    "other reasons include uncertainties in the m@xmath136/l@xmath140 ratio of m81 and of the values assumed by @xcite , which , together , could contribute deviations of factors of approximately two to three . for these reasons",
    ", caution should be taken in estimating the number of lmxbs and stellar mass using this method for m81 and other galaxies with similar issues .",
    "second , to estimate the sfr , we need to estimate the total number of hmxbs and their total luminosity for l@xmath141  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "there are four sources with l@xmath141  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "inspection of the locations of these sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] suggests that at least one of these sources is likely to be a hmxb .",
    "the other three sources all lie on the boundary between hmxbs and lmxbs .",
    "this , combined with the knowledge that the color of an individual source is not sufficient to determine the precise nature of the source (   [ section : hr ] ) , and the fact that we are subject to large poisson errors at the high - luminosity end of the xlf , only allows us to place approximate limits on the sfr estimated with this method .",
    "equation 20 of @xcite suggests a range of sfrs of 0.341.38  m@xmath133  yr@xmath1 for 14 sources with l@xmath141  erg  s@xmath1 , and equation 22 of @xcite suggests a range of sfrs of 0.521.02  m@xmath133  yr@xmath1 for the range of luminosities of these sources , 1.34@xmath142  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "these estimates are comparable to the sfr that has been estimated for m81 based on a combination of ultraviolet , h@xmath143 , and infrared observations ( 0.30.9  m@xmath133 yr@xmath1 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "m81 , m31 , and our milky way are all sb - type galaxies with similar sfrs near 1  m@xmath133  yr@xmath1 .",
    "below , we make comparisons of the global properties of their x - ray binary populations using their xlfs .",
    "first , the xlfs of both the inner and outer disk regions of m81 are systematically shallower than the hmxb slope of the milky way , but , given the statistical uncertainties and uncertainties in the agn contribution , are fairly consistent with one another .",
    "while the m81 inner and outer disk regions do appear to be dominated by hmxbs , they also contain other types of sources ( e.g. , agn , snrs ) that we are unable to separate conclusively on an individual basis at the present time .",
    "second , the near match of the m81 bulge and the normalized lmxb population in the milky way is striking ( fig .  [",
    "fig : xlfs_merged ] ) .",
    "we find that the low - luminosity lmxb slope of the milky way is similar to the low - luminosity slope found for the m81 bulge within the uncertainties . also , the cutoffs in the lmxb xlfs are within a factor of @xmath144 of one another , supporting the notion that the bulge of m81 is dominated by lmxbs as seen in the color - color plot ( fig .  [",
    "fig : hr ] ) .",
    "we find that the normalized xlf of the inner @xmath145 region of m31 as measured with chandra by @xcite is quite similar to the bulge xlf of m81 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xlfs_merged ] ) .",
    "these data also match well to the bulge region observations measured with xmm - newton ( r@xmath146 ) by @xcite .",
    "the disk xlfs of m31 are more difficult to compare as studies of the m31 disk return different results ( @xcite , @xcite ) . although the xlfs in each of the disk regions are consistent with single , unbroken power law , as expected , the power - law slopes measured by each group are significantly different .",
    "we examine some of the reasons for these differences below .",
    "the disk xlfs of @xcite do not include ulxs or any sources brighter than @xmath147  erg  s@xmath1 ( unlike the disk xlfs in m81 and the hmxb xlf of the milky way ) .",
    "however , the field of view of chandra is much smaller than m31 and all of the chandra fields in @xcite together still only cover a fraction of the disk of m31 . as noted in @xcite",
    ", there are much brighter sources seen in their fields , which cover most of the m31 disk that are being missed in small - area surveys .",
    "missing these brighter sources could truncate the high - luminosity end of @xcite s disk xlfs , and could make these xlfs steeper .",
    "however , the effect that a few bright sources have on the best - fit slope is not obvious without further detailed analysis , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "second , ( as pointed out in * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 5 ) , model bias in the spectral fitting of each of the point sources that comprise the xlf could affect the best - fit normalization and slope of the xlf .",
    "for instance , @xcite fit all of their sources with a fixed , absorbed power law , which could be biasing their xlfs .",
    "we could also be slightly biased by choosing a power law as our initial fitting model , but we expect this to have a smaller effect because we have allowed for the possibility of a model that better describes softer sources ( blackbody ) .",
    "in addition , we float our photon index or blackbody temperature for all sources with more than 25 counts and always float our column densities for all sources with more than 5 counts .    thoroughly assessing",
    "the impact of a single versus a variable conversion factor on the xlfs directly is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we can make some simple statistical comparisons for the merged luminosities of the sources in the master source list .",
    "we compare the error that would arise from using a single conversion factor to calculate the luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conv_factor ] ) and the statistical error in the luminosity scaled from the bayesian error in the counts .",
    "we find that the shape of both distributions is very similar , but that the median and the width of the distribution of the statistical percent error is greater than the median ( by approximately a factor of 1.5 ) and the width of the distribution of the percent error that would arise from using a single conversion factor . because the conversion factor errors are typically smaller than the statistical errors in the luminosity",
    ", we suspect that the effect on the xlfs would probably be fairly small , but maybe non - negligible .    in light of these issues",
    ", we only compare our disk and entire galaxy xlf results to the disk xlfs constructed by @xcite .",
    "the total disk xlf that these authors construct surprisingly seems to better match the m81 xlf of the entire galaxy rather than the inner or outer disk xlfs .",
    "first , they claim a break in their total disk xlf , which happens to coincide with the measured break in the m81 xlf of the entire galaxy . also , the power - law slopes are in good agreement with the slopes that we measure for m81 s entire galaxy xlf .",
    "these results suggest that the disk of m31 has a high - luminosity component similar to what is seen in the inner and outer disks of m81 , but it also seems to have a more considerable population of lmxbs there that produce at least a marginally significant break near @xmath70  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "we have presented an in - depth analysis of multiple aspects of the x - ray source population of m81 from the perspective of the x - ray observations alone .",
    "we conducted our source detection procedure carefully , producing a master source list of 265 sources .",
    "we then extracted and individually fit the spectra for each of these sources in each of the 16 observations of m81 included in our analysis . with the spectral information , we calculated hardness ratios and used the aid of a color - color plot to classify different populations of sources . from the population study",
    ", we devised an alternate conservative method of separating the bulge and the disk of the galaxy .",
    "then , we quantified the variability of the individual sources and considered their possible effect on the luminosity function of the galaxy .",
    "we find that , despite detecting significant variability in @xmath14860% of the sources included in the xlfs , the xlf of m81 remains stable at luminosities greater than @xmath149  erg  s@xmath1 . finally , we plotted and fit the xlfs , analyzed them with regard to their point source populations , and compared them to the xlfs of m31 and the milky way .",
