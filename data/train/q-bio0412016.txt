    "in a liquid of molecules long chain - like macromolecules ( mm ) can be formed due to a special steric intermolecular interaction .",
    "these mm are often called polymers @xcite .",
    "we assume that the mm are directed , i.e. they have a preferred direction in the @xmath2-dimensional space .",
    "this implies that they are stretched and do not form loops or overhangs .    in many systems the constituting molecules ( cm ) of the mm are identical .",
    "however , in more complex systems , like in biological substances , the cm are chemically different .",
    "an example for the latter are the sequences of amino acids in proteins @xcite and molecular sequences along a dna helix . for our statistical model",
    "we assume that there are @xmath0 different kinds of molecules , represented by @xmath0 colors .",
    "they are randomly chosen to contribute to the mm such that the resulting mm can be viewed as a chain of colored beads ( cf .",
    "an ensemble of mm can be considered as being created in a liquid of molecules by a steric interaction among the cm . as a result",
    ", we have a space - filling system of molecules , where some are constituting the mm and others exist as individual molecules .",
    "properties of the ensemble on large scales should not depend on local structures .",
    "this allows us to consider a lattice model @xcite , where each lattice site is occupied by a molecule of each type .",
    "it is assumed that molecules of the same type have a strong repulsive interaction .",
    "this restricts us to at most one molecule of each type at any given lattice site .",
    "the fact that the interaction of different molecule types is neglected can be understood as a chemical property of the molecules .",
    "any pair of neighboring molecules can form a bond state , representing a pair of molecules , which acts as a building block for an mm .",
    "there is a tendency of these bond states to bond with other molecules .",
    "this leads eventually to an equilibrium state , where we have a mixture of only large mm and individual molecules .",
    "the repulsive interaction between the molecules creates correlations among the mm which lead to interesting properties of the ensemble .",
    "for instance , the density of mm as a function of the probability of a local bond state is of interest , as well as the question how likely it is to break an mm or to replace a cm of special type by one of a different type .",
    "the latter can happen during a collision process when an individual molecule collides with an mm and exchanges with a cm of the mm .",
    "we consider an equilibrium ensemble of lattice mm and define three quantities to describe its global properties with respect to the molecular structure .",
    "there are two quantities that measure the correlations in real space .",
    "one measures how likely it is to break a directed mm and take it apart in space ( cf .",
    "2 ) , the other one measures how likely it is to create a new ( finite ) mm by changing the type of the cm in an mm .",
    "if the ends of the broken mm or the ends of the new ( finite ) mm are @xmath3 and @xmath4 we write for the corresponding quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "it will be shown that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are directly related .",
    "another quantity is the coherence in @xmath7 ( molecular - component ) space .",
    "this is called @xmath8 and measures how likely it is to replace a cm of type @xmath7 in an mm by one of type @xmath9 ( cf . fig .",
    "3 ) .",
    "all these quantities are evaluated in the limit @xmath10 and in a @xmath1 expansion .",
    "we apply a functional - integral formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to perform the calculations in a straightforward manner .",
    "a statistical model for the equilibrium statistics of directed mm was introduced in ref .",
    "we briefly summarize the construction of the model and then turn to the evaluation of the interesting correlations mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the model is based on the idea that on each site of a ( cubic ) lattice @xmath0 different molecules are located .",
    "they exist either as individual ( separated ) molecules of a liquid with relative weight @xmath11 or contribute to a directed mm as a bond state of a nearest - neighbor molecular pair at @xmath12 of type @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the mm are directed , i.e. there is a special direction @xmath13 in the @xmath2-dimensional space as a preferred direction of the mm .",
    "the fluctuations of the mm are perpendicular to this , indicated by the @xmath14-dimensional vector @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , we write @xmath16 for a site on the lattice .",
    "the relative weight of a nearest - neighbor molecular pair at @xmath12 of type @xmath7 and @xmath9 is @xmath17 the directed chain - like structure is given by the matrix @xmath18 that is asymmetric in the direction @xmath13 but symmetric with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath4 is assumed to be later along the direction of the mm .",
    "@xmath18 is also symmetric with repect to @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath7 and @xmath15 are of the same type in contrast to @xmath13 .",
    "the statistical distribution of configurations of mm has to take into account a strong repulsive interaction between molecules of the same type at the same site .",
    "this can be conveniently be described by a commutative algebra of nilpotent variables @xmath20 ( i.e. , @xmath21 if @xmath22 ) with @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "each molecule , characterized by its position @xmath25 on the lattice and by its chemical character @xmath26 , is described by a variable . since @xmath27 are nilpotent , the repulsive interaction results in an exclusion principle for molecules of the same type .",
    "the atoms are considered as classical objects .",
    "consequently , products of @xmath20 must be commutative .",
    "a segment of the mm ( i.e. a bond state of two molecules or a dimer ) reads @xmath28 a linear mapping of the algebra @xmath27 to the complex numbers can be written as an integral on a lattice @xmath29 with @xcite @xmath30 the integral vanishes if the product is incomplete with respect to the lattice @xmath29 , to @xmath23 or to @xmath31 .",
    "it can be used to write the statistical weight @xmath32 of a configuration @xmath33 of mm as @xmath34 with @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a bond between two cm of type @xmath7 and @xmath9 at sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the normalization @xmath37 is the sum over all possible configurations",
    "@xmath38 : @xmath39 finally , we impose periodic boundary conditions on the lattice .",
    "this implies a system on a torus with closed loops of mm .",
    "however , the choice of boundary conditions should not be crucial for the local properties of the mm like the density of the mm , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath8 .",
    "introducing analytic functions of the nilpotent field and using the properties of the integral , we may write for the normalization z=_\\ { i}w_i = . [ norm1 ] in other words , we can replace under the integral @xmath40\\ ] ] in @xmath37 .",
    "another important consequence of the properties of the nilpotent field is that we can calculate the probability that a point @xmath41 belongs to a mm configuration @xmath33 : @xmath42 after summation over all configurations @xmath38 , the probability of a molecule of type @xmath7 at site @xmath3 being part of any mm is @xmath43 this is also the local density @xmath44 of an mm . in a similar manner , we can express the correlations in terms of normalized integrals @xmath45\\ ] ] as correlations in real space @xmath46 @xmath47 and correlations in @xmath7 space @xmath48 these are correlation functions in real space and in @xmath7 space , respectively .",
    "the density of mm can also be expressed as @xmath49    a lengthy but straightforward calculation @xcite shows that the normalization @xmath37 in eq .",

    "the density of mm is @xmath73 it increases with decreasing @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . this means that it is more likely to form a mm if the number of available types of molecules is reduced .",
    "how likely it is to break a mm depends on the position of the remaining ends @xmath74 . the corresponding quantity @xmath5 decays with @xmath75 which indicates that the molecules have a tendency to form a mm .",
    "however , it does not vanish asymptotically but stays nonzero for @xmath76 and @xmath77 : @xmath78 \\big).\\ ] ] the @xmath79 dependence of this asymptotic result is shown in fig .",
    "the same property is valid for the creation of a finite chain of molecules with end points @xmath12 , decribed by @xmath6 .",
    "the correlation in @xmath7 space @xmath8 , describing how likely it is to change the type of molecules in the mm , does not depend on the specific pair @xmath80 as long as @xmath81 because the model connects all @xmath82 with equal probability : @xmath83 the @xmath10 terms of both correlations @xmath84 and @xmath72 agree but there is a difference in terms of order @xmath1 ( s. fig .",
    "it is unlikely to break an mm and separate the pieces at low and at high density .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that there are either too few mm or too many at high densities such that the separation of the pieces is difficult .",
    "it is remarkable that already at densities less than 1 the separation is completely blocked , as indicated by the vanishing @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , the substitution of a cm is most likely at intermediate densities but suppressed at low and high densities .",
    "again , there is a critical density @xmath86 such that the substitution is blocked for @xmath87 .",
    "this can be understood as an effect of interaction : since there is a exclusion between molecules of the same type , we can only substitute if there is no contribution of this molecule from another mm . at high densities",
    "it is very unlikely that a site is not occupied yet by a cm of a specific type from another mm .",
    "to analyse asymptotic behaviour of the correlation function for large distances @xmath88 of a three - dimensional system , we first have to perform the @xmath89-integration in eqs .",
