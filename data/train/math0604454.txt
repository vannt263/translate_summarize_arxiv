    "by _ max algebra _ we understand the analog of linear algebra obtained by considering @xmath1 ( the nonnegative reals ) with max times operations : @xmath2 @xmath3 extended to matrices and vectors .",

    "there are several essentially equivalent definitions of max algebra .",
    "an early paper presenting the above version is @xcite , another early paper presenting an equivalent version is @xcite . for more information on max algebra , its generalizations and applications the reader",
    "is referred e.g. to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for recent developments in the area and for further references .",
    "we give a summary of the contents of this paper . in section 2",
    "we begin by defining ( max ) cones , extremals , generating sets , independent sets and totally dependent sets .",
    "the key observation is proposition [ spanit ] which extends ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.9 ) .",
    "we deduce in theorem [ morextr ] that extremals are minimal elements of max cones under suitable scalings of vectors .",
    "this leads us to a reformulation and new proof of the basic result theorem [ mainres ] which is also easily derived from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.5.3 ) : every generating set of a max cone can be partitioned into the set of the extremals of a cone and a set of redundant elements .",
    "it follows that if a cone has a basis then ( under a scaling condition ) it consists of the extremals of the cone and hence the cone has a basis unique up to scalar multiples , see theorem [ nextres ] and its corollaries for more detail . in corollary [ totdep ] we then turn to the case when the set of extremals of the cone is empty , in which case every generating set is totally dependent .",
    "discussion of totally dependent sets specifically may be new . towards the end of this section we consider topological notions . in corollary",
    "[ open ] we show that ( under a natural restriction ) every open cone has totally dependent generators and in proposition [ c : cc ] we prove an analogue of minkowski s theorem for closed cones .",
    "this result extends a result due to @xcite and it also appears as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) where a different proof is given . in section 3 we give two simple versions of an algorithm , based on ( * ? ? ? * theorem 16.2 ) for finding the ( essentially unique ) basis of a finitely generated max cone and a matlab program which implements one version .",
    "we also relate our problem to the classical problem of finding maxima of a set of vectors which is described in @xcite and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) , and give the bounds for computational complexity .",
    "we now relate the concepts and techniques of our proofs to those in other publications .",
    "most of our concepts appear in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , sometimes under different names .",
    "for instance , extremals are called irreducible elements in @xcite and @xcite , and minimal elements are called efficient points in @xcite . our key proposition [ spanit ] may also be derived from ( possibly slightly extended ) results found in some of our references .",
    "examples are results in @xcite section 2 in terms of set coverings , see also @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 15.6 ) and @xcite section 2 , or the fundamental results of @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) concerning max linear systems .",
    "the latter are also found in @xcite and @xcite in terms of a projection operator .",
    "further , such results on max linear systems as proposition [ spanit ] and proposition [ extension ] can be extended to the case of functional galois connections , as it is shown in @xcite .",
    "the generalizations considered in @xcite are useful in many areas including abstract convex analysis , the theory of hamilton - jacobi equation and the monge - kantorovitch mass transportation problem .",
    "our topic is also related to ( and partially stimulated by ) the emerging field of tropical geometry which develops basic concepts of max algebra in a different form and with different terminology and applies these to finitely generated structures , see @xcite,@xcite and @xcite . in particular ,",
    "proposition [ spanit ] can also be seen as a minor extension of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.9 ) which is important in the theory of tropical halfspaces .",
    "the emphasis of these papers is on geometry , while in this paper it is on algebraic and order theoretic results .",
    "max cones are also studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main effort of these papers is to develop the theory of max - plus convex sets and their recession cones .",
    "this theory is not present in our paper . in turn",
    ", we deal with more general cones and we emphasize the link to set maxima and give a more detailed description of bases and generating sets .    in max algebra as in linear algebra a basis is normally defined as an _ indexed set _ , that is a _ sequence _ if the basis is finite or countable , see @xcite for a definition in max algebra or @xcite in linear algebra .",
    "since we wish to show the inclusion of the set of extremals ( which do not have a natural order ) in every generating set or basis for a cone we define the latter in term of _ sets _ in section 2 . we thereby exclude the possibility of a repetition of elements in generating sets .",
    "but we change our point of view in section 3 on algorithms for finitely generated cones since we wish to consider the generators as columns of a matrix .",
    "max cones have much in common with convex cones , see @xcite for a general reference .",
    "this has been exploited ( and generalized ) in many papers including those just quoted and e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to this end , the basic concepts of this paper and such results as theorem [ mainres ] , proposition [ c : cc ] and proposition [ p : clcl ] have their direct analogs in terms of positive linear combinations and in convex analysis .",
    "we do not provide details , as convex geometry is also beyond our scope here .",
