    "since the middle of last century , there has been a multidisciplinary interest in wars and armed conflicts ( quantified in terms of casualties ) , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "studies have also covered the statistics of terrorism , for instance @xcite , @xcite , and the special issue of _ risk analysis _ on terrorism @xcite . from a statistical point of view , recent contributions have attempted to show that the distribution of war casualties ( or terrorist attacks victims ) tends to have heavy tails , characterized by a power law decay @xcite and @xcite .",
    "often , the analysis of armed conflicts falls within the broader study of violence @xcite , @xcite , with the aim to understand whether we as human are more or less violent and aggressive than in the past and what role institutions played in that respect .",
    "accordingly , the public intellectual arena has witnessed active debates , such as the one between steven pinker on one side , and john gray on the other concerning the hypothesis that the long peace was a statistically established phenomenon or a mere statistical sampling error that is characteristic of heavy - tailed processes , @xcite and @xcite the latter of which is corroborated by this paper .    using a more recent data set containing 565 armed conflicts with more than 3000 casualties over the period 1 - 2015 ad",
    ", we confirm that the distribution of war casualties exhibits a very heavy right - tail .",
    "the tail is so heavy that  at first glance  war casualties could represent an infinite - mean phenomenon , as defined by @xcite .",
    "but should the distribution of war casualties have an infinite mean , the annihilation of the human species would be just a matter of time , and the sample properties we can compute from data have no meaning at all in terms of statistical inference .",
    "in reality , a simple argument allows us to rule out the infiniteness of the mean : no event or series of events can kill more than the whole world population .",
    "the support of the distribution of war casualties is necessarily bounded , and the true mean can not be infinite .",
    "let @xmath0 $ ] be the support of the distribution of war casualties today .",
    "@xmath1 can not be smaller than 0 , and we can safely fix it at some level @xmath2 to ignore those small events that are not readily definable as armed conflict @xcite . as to @xmath3 , its value can not be larger than the world population , i.e. 7.2 billion people in 2015 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath4 is the random variable representing war casualties , its range of variation is very large and equal to @xmath5 .",
    "studying the distribution of @xmath4 can be difficult , given its bounded but extremely wide support . finding the right parametric model among the family of possible ones is hard , while nonparametric approaches are more difficult to interpret from a risk analysis point of view .",
    "our approach is to transform the data in order to apply the powerful tools of extreme value theory .",
    "since @xmath6 we suggest a log - transformation of the data .",
    "this allows to use tools such as @xcite .",
    "theoretical results such as the pickands , balkema and de haan s theorem allow us to simplify the choice of the model to fit to our data .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath3 be respectively the lower and the upper bound of a random variable y , and define the function @xmath7 it is easy to verify that    1 .",
    "@xmath8 is `` smooth '' : @xmath9 , 2 .",
    "@xmath10 3 .",
    "@xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath12 defines a new random variable with lower bound @xmath1 and an infinite upper bound .",
    "notice that the transformation induced by @xmath13 does not depend on any of the parameters of the distribution of @xmath4 . in",
    "what follows , we will call the distributions of @xmath4 and @xmath14 , respectively the real and the dual distribution .    by studying the tail properties of the dual distribution ( the one with an infinite upper bound ) , using extreme value theory , we will be able to obtain , by reverting to the real distribution , what we call the _ shadow _ mean of war casualties .",
    "we will show that this mean is at least 1.5 times larger than the sample mean , but nevertheless finite .",
    "we assume that many observations are missing from the dataset ( from under - reported conflicts ) , and we base on analysis on the fact that war casualties are just imprecise estimates @xcite , on which historians often have disputes , without anyone s ability to verify the assessments using period sources .",
    "for instance , an event that took place in the eighth century , the an lushan rebellion , is thought to have killed 13 million people , but there no precise or reliable methodology to allow us to trust that number which could be conceivably one order of magnitude smaller .. using resampling techniques , we show that our tail estimates are robust to changes in the quality and reliability of data .",
    "our results and conclusions will replicate even we missed a third of the data .",
    "when focusing on the more reliable set covering the last 500 years of data , one can not observe any specific trend in the number of conflicts , as large wars appear to follow a homogeneous poisson process .",
    "this memorylessness in the data conflicts with the idea that war violence has declined over time , as proposed by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ data ] describes our data set and analyses the most significant problems with the quality of observations ; section [ danalysis ] is a descriptive analysis of data ; it shows some basic result , which are already sufficient to refute the thesis @xcite that we are living in a more peaceful world on the basis of statistical observations ; section [ eanalysis ] contains our investigations about the upper tail of the dual distribution of war casualties as well as discussions of tail risk ; section [ ghost ] deals with the estimation of the shadow mean ; in section [ missingdata ] we discuss the robustness of our results to imprecision and errors in the data ; finally , section [ trendarm ] looks at the number of conflicts over time , showing no visible trend in the last 500 years .",
    "the data set contains 565 events over the period 1 - 2015 ad ; an excerpt is shown in table [ data ] .",
    "events are generally armed conflicts , such as interstate wars and civil wars , with a few exceptions represented by violence against citizens perpetrated by the bloodiest dictatorships , such as stalin s and mao zedong s regimes .",
    "these were included in order to be consistent with previous works about war victims and violence , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we had to deal with the problem of inconsistency and lack of uniformity in the attribution of casualties by historians .",
    "some events such as the siege of jerusalem include death from famine , while for other wars only direct military victims are counted",
    ". it might be difficult to disentangle death from direct violence from those arising from such side effects as contagious diseases , hunger , rise in crime , etc . nevertheless ,",
    "as we show in our robustness analysis these inconsistencies do not affect out results in contrast with analyses done on thin - tailed data ( or data perceived to be so ) where conclusions can be reversed on the basis of a few observations .",
    "the different sources for the data are : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for websites like necrometrics @xcite ,",
    "data have been double - checked against the cited references . the first observation in our data set",
    "is the boudicca s revolt of 60 - 61 ad , while the last one is the international armed conflict against the islamic state of iraq and the levant , still open .",
    "we include all events with more than 3000 casualties ( soldiers and civilians ) in absolute terms , without any rescaling with respect to the coeval world population .",
    "more details about rescaling in subsection [ rescaling ] .",
    "the choice of the 3000 victims threshold was motivated by three main observations :    * conflicts with a high number of victims are more likely to be registered and studied by historians . while it is easier today to have reliable numbers about minor conflicts",
    " although this point has been challenged by @xcite and @xcite  it is highly improbable to ferret out all smaller events that took place in the fifth century ad . in particular , a historiographical bias prevents us from accounting for much of the conflicts that took place in the americas and australia , before their discovery by european conquerors . *",
    "a higher threshold gives us a higher confidence about the estimated number of casualties , thanks to the larger number of sources , even if , for the bloodiest events of the far past , we must be careful about the possible exaggeration of numbers . *",
    "the object of our concern is tail risk .",
    "the extreme value techniques we use to study the right tail of the distribution of war casualties imposition of thresholds , actually even larger than 3000 casualties .",
    "to rescale conflicts and expressing casualties in terms of today s world population ( more details in subsection [ rescaling ] ) , we relied on the population estimates of @xcite for the period 1 - 1599 ad , and of @xcite and @xcite for the period 1650 - 2015 ad .",
    "we used :    * century estimates from 1 ad to 1599 . * half - century estimates from 1600 to 1899 . * decennial estimates from 1900 to 1949 . * yearly estimates from 1950 until today",
    ".      accounts of war casualties are often anecdotal , spreading via citations , and based on vague estimates , without anyone s ability to verify the assessments using period sources .",
    "for instance , the independence war of algeria has various estimates , some from the french army , others from the rebels , and nothing scientifically obtained @xcite .",
    "this can lead to several estimates for the same conflict , some more conservative and some less . table [ data ] , shows different estimates for most conflicts . in case of several estimates",
    ", we present the minimum , the average and the maximum one .",
    "interestingly , as we show later , choosing one of the three as the  true \" estimate does not affect our results thanks to the scaling properties of power laws .",
    "conflicts , such as the mongolian invasions , which we refer to as  named \" conflicts , need to be treated with care from a statistical point of view .",
    "named conflicts are in fact artificial tags created by historians to aggregate events that share important historical , geographical and political characteristics , but that may have never really existed as a single event . under the portmanteau mongolian invasions ( or conquests ) , historians collect all conflicts related to the expansion of the mongol empire during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries .",
    "another example is the so - called hundred - years war in the period 1337 - 1453 .",
    "aggregating all these events necessarily brings to the creation of very large fictitious conflicts accounting for hundreds of thousands or million casualties . the fact that , for historical and historiographical reasons , these events tends to be more present in antiquity and",
    "the middle ages could bring to a naive overestimation of the severity of wars in the past .",
    "notice that named conflicts like the mongolian invasions are different from those like ww1 or ww2 , which naturally also involved several tens of battles in very different locations , but which took place in a much shorter time period , with no major time separation among conflicts .",
    "a straightforward technique could be to set a cutoff - point of 25 years for any single event an 80 years event would be divided into three minor ones .",
    "however it remains that the length of the window remains arbitrary .",
    "why 25 years ? why not 17 ?    as we show in section [ eanalysis ] , a solution to all these problems with data is to consider each single observation as an imprecise estimate , a fuzzy number in the definition of @xcite .",
    "using monte carlo methods we have shown that , if we assume that the real number of casualties in a conflict is uniformly distributed between the minimum and the maximum in the available data , the tail exponent @xmath15 is not really affected ( apart from the obvious differences in the smaller decimals ) .",
    "similarly , our results remain invariant if we remove / add a proportion of the observations by bootstrapping our sample and generating new data sets .",
    "we believe that this approach to data as imprecise observations is one of the novelties of our work , which makes our conclusions more robust to scrutiny about the quality of data .",
    "we refer to section [ eanalysis ] for more details .",
    "we are confident that there are many conflicts that are not part of our sample .",
    "for example we miss all conflicts among native populations in the american continent before its european discovery , as no source of information is actually available .",
    "similarly we may miss some conflicts of antiquity in europe , or in china in the sixteenth century .",
    "however , we can assume that the great part of these conflicts is not in the very tail of the distribution of casualties , say in the top 10 or 20% .",
    "it is in fact not really plausible to assume that historians have not reported a conflict with 1 or 2 million casualties , or that such an event is not present in @xcite and @xcite , at least for what concerns europe , asia and africa .",
    "nevertheless , in subsection [ missingdata ] , we deal with the problem of missing data in more details .",
    "we are not assuming the existence of a unique conflict generator process .",
    "it is clear that all conflicts of humanity do not share the same set of causes .",
    "conflicts belonging to different centuries and continents are likely to be not only independent , as already underlined in @xcite and @xcite , but also to have different origins .",
    "we thus avoid performing time series analysis beyond the straightforward investigation of the existence of trends .",
    "while it could make sense to subject the data to specific tests , such as whether an increase / decrease in war casualties is caused by the lethality of weapons , it would be unrigorous and unjustified to look for an autoregressive component",
    ". how could the an lushan rebellion in china ( 755 ad ) depend on the siege of constantinople by arabs ( 717 ad ) , or affect the viking raids in ireland ( from 795 ad on ) ? but this does not mean that all conflicts are independent : during ww2 , the attack on pearl harbor and the battle of france were not independent , despite the time and spatial separation , and that s why historians merge them into one single event . and while we can accept that most of the causes of ww2 are related to ww1 , when studying numerical casualties , we avoid translating the dependence into the magnitude of the events : it would be naive to believe that the number of victims in 1944 depended on the death toll in 1917 .",
    "how could the magnitude of ww2 depend on ww1 ?",
    "critically , when related conflicts are aggregated , as in the case of ww2 or for the hundred years war ( 1337 - 1453 ) , our data show that the number of conflicts over time  if we focused on very destructive events in the last 500/600 years and we believed in the existence of a conflict generator process  is likely to follow a homogeneous poisson process , as already observed by @xcite and @xcite , thus supporting the idea that wars are randomly distributed accidents over time , not following any particular trend .",
    "we refer to section [ eanalysis ] for more details .",
    "we used three different types of data in our analyses : raw data , rescaled data and dual data .",
    "presented as collected from the different sources , and shown in table [ data ] .",
    "let @xmath16 be the number of casualties in a given conflict at time @xmath17 , define the triplet @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the lower and upper bound , if available .",
    "the data is rescaled with respect to the current world population ( 7.2 billion ) .",
    "define the triplet @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the world population in 2015 and @xmath23 is the population at time @xmath24 .",
    "rescaled data was used by steven pinker @xcite to account for the relative impact of a conflict .",
    "this rescaling tends to inflate past conflicts , and can lead to the naive statement that violence , if defined in terms of casualties , has declined over time .",
    "but we agree with those scholars like robert epstein @xcite stating  [ ... ] why should we be content with only a relative decrease ? by this logic , when we reach a world population of nine billion in 2050 , pinker will conceivably be satisfied if a mere two million people are killed in war that year \" .",
    "in this paper we used rescaled data for comparability reasons , and to show that even with rescaled data we can not really state statistically that war casualties have declined over time ( and thus violence ) .",
    "those we obtain using the log - rescaling of equation ( [ transform ] ) , the triplet @xmath25 .",
    "the input for the function @xmath13 are the rescaled values @xmath26 .",
    "removing the upper bound allows us to combine practical convenience with theoretical rigor .",
    "since we want to apply the tools of extreme value theory , the finiteness of the upper bound is fundamental to decide whether a heavy - tailed distribution falls in the weibull ( finite upper bound ) or in the frchet class ( infinite upper bound ) . given their finite upper bound , war casualties are necessarily in the weibull class . from a theoretical point of view",
    "the difference is large @xcite , especially for the existence of moments .",
    "but from a practical point of view , heavy - tailed phenomena are better modeled within the frchet class .",
    "power laws belong to this class . and",
    "as observed by @xcite , when a fat - tailed random variable @xmath4 has a very large finite upper bound @xmath3 , unlikely to be ever touched ( and thus observed in the data ) , its tail , which from a theoretical point of view falls in the so - called weibull class , can be modeled as if belonging to the frchet one .",
    "in other words , from a practical point of view , when @xmath3 is very large , it is impossible to distinguish the two classes ; and in most of the cases this is indeed not a problem .",
    "problems arise when the tail looks so thick that even the first moment appears to be infinite , when we know that this is not possible . and",
    "this is exactly the case with out data , as we show in the next section .",
    ", since only @xmath27 is observed . ]    figure [ tailcomp ] shows illustrates the need to separate real and dual data . for a random variable @xmath4 with remote upper bound @xmath3 , the real tail",
    "is represented by the continuous line . however , if we only observe values up to @xmath27 , and we ignore the existence of @xmath3 , which is unlikely to be reached and therefore hardly observable , we could be inclined to believe the the tail is the dotted one , the apparent one .",
    "the two tails are indeed essentially indistinguishable for most cases , but the divergence is evident when we approach @xmath3 . hence our transformation .",
    "notice that @xmath28 for very large values of @xmath3 .",
    "this means that for a very large upper bound , unlikely to be reached as the world population , the results we get for the tail of @xmath4 and @xmath12 are essentially the same most of the times .",
    "this is exactly what happens with our data , considered that no armed conflict has ever killed more than 19% of the world population ( the three kingdoms , 184 - 280 ad ) .",
    "but while @xmath4 is bounded , @xmath14 is not .",
    "therefore we can safely model @xmath14 as belonging to the frchet class , study its tail behavior , and then come back to @xmath4 when we are interested in the first moments , which under @xmath14 could not exist .",
    "figure [ bubbles ] showing casualties over time , is composed of four subfigures , two related to raw data and two related to dual data ) , rescaled and dual data are approximately the same , hence there is no need to show further pictures . ] . for each type of data , using the radius of the different bubbles , we show the relative size of each event in terms of victims with respect to the world population and within our data set ( what we call impact ) .",
    "note that the choice of the type of data ( or of the definition of size ) may lead to different interpretation of trends and patterns . from rescaled and dual data , one",
    "could be lead to superficially infer a decrease in the number of casualties over time .    as to the number of armed conflicts , figure [ bubbles ] seems to suggest an increase over time , as we see that most events are concentrated in the last 500 years or so , an apparent illusionary increase most likely due to a reporting bias for the conflicts of antiquity and early middle ages .",
    "figure [ hist ] shows the histogram of war casualties , when dealing with raw data .",
    "similar results are obtained using rescaled and dual casualties .",
    "the graphs suggests the presence of a long right tail in the distribution of victims , and the maximum is represented by ww2 , with an estimated amount of about 73 million victims .",
    "the presence of a paretian tail is also supported by the quantile - quantile plot in figure [ qqplot ] , where we use the exponential distribution as a benchmark .",
    "the concave behavior we can observe in the plot is considered a good signal of fat - tailed distribution @xcite , @xcite .    in order to investigate the presence of a right fat tail ,",
    "we can make use of another graphical tool : the _ meplot _ , that is , mean excess function plot .",
    "let @xmath29 be a random variable with distribution @xmath30 and right endpoint @xmath31 ( i.e. @xmath32 ) .",
    "the function @xmath33=\\frac{\\int_u^\\infty ( t - u ) \\text{d}f(t)}{\\int_u^\\infty \\text{d}f(t ) } , \\qquad 0<u < x_f,\\ ] ] is called mean excess function of @xmath29 ( mef ) .",
    "the empirical mef of a sample @xmath34 , @xmath35 , ... ,",
    "@xmath36 is easily computed as @xmath37 that is the sum of the exceedances over the threshold @xmath38 divided by the number of such data points .",
    "interestingly , the mean excess function is a way of characterizing distributions within the class of continuous distributions @xcite .",
    "for example , power law distributions are characterized by the van der wijk s law @xcite , that is , by a mean excess function linearly increasing in the threshold @xmath38 , while an exponential distribution of parameter @xmath39 would show a constant mean excess function with value @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ meplot ] shows the the meplot of war casualties , again using raw data . the graph is easily obtained by plotting the pairs @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the @xmath42th order statistic , used as a threshold . the upward trend in figure [ meplot ] is a further signal of fat - tailed data , as discussed for example in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a characteristic of the power law class is the non - existence ( infiniteness ) of moments , at least the higher - order ones , with important consequences in terms of statistical inference .",
    "if the variance is not finite , as is often the case with financial data , it becomes more problematic to build confidence intervals for the mean .",
    "similarly , if the third moment ( skewness ) is not defined , it is risky to build confidence intervals for the variance .",
    "an interesting graphical tool showing the behavior of moments in a given sample , is the _ maximum - to - sum plot _ , or ms plot .",
    "the ms plot relies on simple consequence of the law of large numbers @xcite . for a sequence @xmath43 of nonnegative i.i.d .",
    "random variables , if for @xmath44 , @xmath45<\\infty$ ] , then @xmath46 as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the partial sum , and @xmath49 the partial maximum .    , suggesting that the moments of order 2 or higher may not be finite . ]",
    "figures [ msplot_raw ] and [ msplot_pink ] show the ms plots of war casualties for raw and rescaled data respectively .",
    "no finite moment appears to exist , no matter how much data is used : it is in fact clear that the @xmath50 ratio does not converge to 0 for @xmath51 , thus suggesting that the distribution of war casualties has such a fat right tail that not even the first moment exists .",
    "this is particularly evident for rescaled data . to compare to thin tailed situations , [ mscompare ]",
    "shows the ms plot of a pareto @xmath52 : notice that the first moment exists , while the other moments are not defined , as the shape parameter equals @xmath53 . for thin tailed distributions such as the normal",

    "if the last statement were verified for large armed conflicts , it would mean that no particular trend can be observed , i.e. that the propensity of humanity to generate big wars has neither decreased nor increased over time .    in order to avoid problems with the armed conflicts of antiquity and possible missing data ,",
    "we here restrict our attention on all events who took place after 1500 ad , i.e. in the last 515 years . as we have shown in section [ eanalysis ] ,",
    "missing data are unlikely to influence our estimates of the shape parameter @xmath15 , but they surely have an impact on the number of observations in a given period",

    "if large events , those above the 25k threshold for raw data ( or the 145k one for rescaled amounts ) , follow a homogeneous poisson process , in the period 1500 - 2015ad , their inter - arrival times need to be exponentially distributed .",
    "moreover , no time dependence should be identified among inter - arrival times , for example when plotting an autocorrelogram ( acf ) .",
    "figure [ hypotheses ] shows that both of these characteristics are satisfactorily observable in our data set .",
    "this is clearly visible in the qq - plot of subfigure [ qqgaps ] , where most inter - arrival times tend to cluster on the diagonal .",
    "another way to test if large armed conflicts follow a homogeneous poisson process is by considering the number of events in non - overlapping intervals . for a poisson process ,",
    "given a certain number of events in a time interval , the numbers of events in non - overlapping subintervals follow a multinomial distribution . if the poisson process is homogeneous , then the multinomial distribution is characterized by the same probability of falling in any of the sub - intervals , that is an equiprobability .",
    "it is not difficult to verify this with our data , and to see that we can not reject the null hypothesis of equiprobable multinomial distribution , over the period 1500 - 2015 , in which 504 events took place , choosing a confidence level of 10% .",

    "if we restrict our attention on the period 1500 - 2015 , we find @xmath59 for raw data , and @xmath60 for rescaled amounts .    to conclude this section , no particular trend in the number of armed conflicts can be traced .",

    "<S> we apply methods from extreme value theory on the dual distribution and derive its tail properties . </S>",
    "<S> the dual method allows us to calculate the real mean of war casualties , which proves to be considerably larger than the sample mean , meaning severe underestimation of the tail risks of conflicts from naive observation . </S>",
