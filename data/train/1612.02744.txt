    "biological ion channels are natural nanopores providing for the fast and highly selective permeation of physiologically important ions ( e.g.  na@xmath0 , k@xmath0 and ca@xmath1 ) through cellular membranes @xcite . despite their fundamental importance , and notwithstanding enormous efforts by numerous scientists , the physical origins of their selectivity still remain unclear .",
    "it is known , however , that the conduction and selectivity properties of cation channels are defined by the ions movements and interactions inside a short , narrow selectivity filter ( sf ) lined by negatively charged amino acid residues that provide a net fixed charge @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "earlier , von kitzing had revealed the staircase - like shape of the occupancy _ vs _ site affinity for the charged ion channel @xcite ( following discussions and suggestions in @xcite ) , and comparable low - barrier ion - exchange transitions had been discovered analytically @xcite .",
    "a fermi distribution of spherical ions was used as the foundation of a poisson fermi theory of correlated ions in channels @xcite .",
    "icb has recently been observed in sub - nm nanopores @xcite .",
    "it appears to be closely similar to its electronic counterpart in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "as we have demonstrated earlier @xcite , strong icb appears for ca@xmath1 ions in model biological channels and manifests itself as an oscillation of the conductance as a function of @xmath2 , divalent blockade , and amfe .",
    "here we present an enhanced model of divalent blockade and amfe able to encompass concentration - related shifts in the icb conduction bands and the shape of the divalent blockade decay .",

    "the validity and range of applicability of this kind of model have been discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this simplified self - consistent model was used as the basis for development of the icb model of permeation and selectivity @xcite , which led to some predictions that we now test experimentally in two complementary ways : through site - directed mutagenesis and patch - clamp studies of the bacterial sodium nachbac channel ; and numerically through brownian dynamics simulations .",
