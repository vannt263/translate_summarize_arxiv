    "parallel with the study of non - classical squeezed states of electromagnetic radiation @xcite , increasing attention has been devoted to the study of atomic spin squeezed states . in ramsey spectroscopy a sample of @xmath0 two - level atoms is represented by the collective operators @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pauli operators for the @xmath7 atom .",
    "atomic spin squeezed states are quantum correlated states with reduced fluctuations in one of the collective spin components , and they have possible applications in atomic interferometers and high precision atomic clocks .",
    "wineland et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the frequency resolution in spectroscopy depends on the spin squeezing parameter @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes a direction perpendicular to the mean spin .",
    "the inequality @xmath10 indicates that the system is spin squeezed , and it has been shown that any state with @xmath11 is an entangled state @xcite .    in 1993 kitagawa and ueda showed that spin squeezing is produced by simple nonlinear spin hamiltonians in analogy with the non - linear hamiltonians leading to squeezed light @xcite .",
    "a number of experimental proposals for atomic spin squeezing have appeared involving interaction of atoms with squeezed light @xcite , quantum non - demolition measurement of atomic spin states@xcite , and atomic collisional interactions @xcite , and recently the first experimental realizations of spin squeezing have been achieved @xcite .",
    "there is a link between the theory of quantum computing and the theory of spin squeezing through the observation that the register of quantum bits in a quantum computer constitutes an ensemble of effective spins , and a general purpose quantum computer can obviously produce a spin squeezed state of its register qubits .",
    "moreover , proposals for quantum computing may be partly implemented , e.g. , with only a restricted class of operations , which do not suffice for general computing purposes , but which do lead to massive entanglement and possibly to spin squeezing .",
    "we have previously considered such _",
    "reduced instruction set _ ( risq ) quantum computers with ions and atoms @xcite , and we have pointed out that apart from their ability to address particular physics problem such as anti - ferromagnetism , they can also be used to synthesize useful quantum states . in this paper",
    "we present a theory for the spin squeezing expected for different models of interacting spins .",
    "these models encompass a number of theoretical proposals for quantum computing , and although spin squeezing may not be a particularly relevant property in , e.g. , a spintronic or a quantum dot realization of a quantum computer , we wish to point out the possibility of verifying the entangling powers of the permanent or controllable interactions in these systems by simple measurements on the entire system .",
    "the detection of spin squeezing may constitute a useful diagnostic tool in the early stages of the construction of a quantum computer .",
    "the treatment of the most general case of interacting spin systems is a formidable task , dealt with by a number of ingenious approximations in the theory of magnetism in solid state physics . in section [ general ] of the paper , we consider the case of an initially known state of the spins , subject to an arbitrary interaction hamiltonian . by application of ehrenfest s theorem , we can determine the short time behaviour of the system analytically , we can identify the spin squeezing signal , and we can devise the optimum conditions for detecting this signal . in section [ ising ] , we consider a general ising type hamiltonian with the spins constituting a chain with only nearest neighbour interactions of varying magnitude .",
    "we obtain an analytical expression for the spin squeezing of the system at any future time , and we provide different examples of spin chains with constant , alternating and random couplings .",
    "consider a collection of spin 1/2 particles which only interacts through pairwise interactions .",
    "the most general hamiltonian describing this situation is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the transpose @xmath14 , and where @xmath15 are real 3 by 3 matrices .",
    "we assume that the particles are initially prepared in a state where all spins are pointing in a given direction prepared for instance by optical pumping techniques , and we compute the time evolution of the noise in a component perpendicular to the direction of the mean spin .",
    "a convenient representation of this situation is by a collective spin state @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a rotation operator given by the three euler angles @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , and where @xmath21 denotes an eigenstate of @xmath22 and @xmath23 with eigenvalues @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the noise in a direction perpendicular to the mean spin can be found by calculating the square of the rotated @xmath26 operator @xmath27 .    with the general hamiltonian ( [ generalham ] )",

    "( [ derivative ] ) .",
    "since we start out in a state with @xmath46 and since @xmath47 at @xmath48 , the interaction produces spin squeezing if we can find any set of euler angles @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 which gives a negative derivative in eq .",

    "only the sum needs to be specified to determine the short time spin squeezing .",
    "the above argument only states that some squeezing will be produced , it does not say anything about the maximum squeezing .",
    "in the following section we shall analyze special cases of the interaction ( [ generalham ] ) where the squeezing can be calculated exactly for all times .",
    "consider now a general model with arbitrary coupling constants between nearest neighbours in an ising spin chain .",
    "the chain consists of @xmath0 spins with the hamiltonian @xmath54 where we identify the @xmath55 spin with the first one in the chain .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath56 , the chain can be equipped with open or closed boundary conditions .",
    "this hamiltonian arises in recent proposals for quantum computation with atoms in optical lattices @xcite . in these proposals the atoms",
    "interacts with the nearest neighbours and it has been shown that the interaction can be put in the form ( [ hamil ] ) and that this interaction produces spin squeezing @xcite",
    ". other application of this hamiltonian in optical lattices can be found in @xcite .",
    "spin squeezing is much less experimentally challenging to produce and to verify than the full quantum computer , and squeezing can provide a demonstration of the entangling capabilities of the setup as well as having practical application in atomic clocks . from the discussion in section [ general ]",
    "follows that for short times the optimal squeezing is produced by having the spin initially polarized along @xmath4 and by looking at the noise in one of the components @xmath50 , where @xmath57 . for longer time intervals",
    "the optimal noise reduction is in a component @xmath58 with @xmath59 but for simplicity we shall only consider @xmath60 .",
    "the unitary time evolution operator for the hamiltonian @xmath61 can be written    @xmath62    and the operators @xmath63 in the heisenberg picture are readily obtained    @xmath64    we assume an initial state where all spins are pointing up , i.e. , the @xmath65 eigenstate for all @xmath66 , and eq .",

    "two overlapping optical lattices with two different kinds of atoms or atoms in two different ground states may be moved relative to each other in order to establish the dimerized chain hamiltonian .    for the dimerized ising chain , eq.([eq : xigen ] ) reduces to @xmath114 and we see that the spin squeezing does not depend on the number of atoms .",

    "different assumptions may be made about the correlations between different lattice sites , but let us for simplicity consider the case where the occupancies are completely uncorrelated .",
    "simulations for such a model were presented in ref.@xcite , but we can now present analytical results ( for simplicity presented only for the @xmath125 direction ) .    we introduce @xmath126 , in terms of which we can write the mean values of trigonometric functions , @xmath127    we assume a very large number of particles , so that the mean value of eq.([eq : xigen ] ) over different realizations of the spin lattice , is effectively obtained by considering only a single realization consisting of a very large number of particles .",
