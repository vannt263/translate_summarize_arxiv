    "the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom are the spin waves or magnons .",
    "although there exists a vast number of publications  in particular for @xmath0=\\{2,3 }  the impact of the goldstone boson interaction onto the low - temperature behavior of these systems has been largely neglected . while the specific cases @xmath0=\\{2,3 } have been addressed within effective lagrangian field theory in refs .",
    "@xcite , a systematic study of the nature of the interaction in systems with general @xmath0 , seems to be lacking .",
    "it is the aim of the present investigation to rigorously analyze the effect of the goldstone boson interaction in the pressure , in the staggered magnetization , and in the susceptibility , using the systematic and model - independent effective lagrangian technique .",
    "a method widely used to analyze the low - temperature behavior of spin systems with a spontaneously broken internal rotation symmetry is spin - wave theory , or its modified versions adapted to two spatial dimensions @xcite . with respect to the @xmath2=2 + 1 quantum xy model",
    ", the interested reader may also consult refs .",
    "the finite - temperature properties of the @xmath2=2 + 1 heisenberg antiferromagnet and the @xmath2=2 + 1 quantum xy model , have furthermore been analyzed with alternative methods that include schwinger - boson mean - field theory , green s functions , renormalization group methods , and monte - carlo simulations .",

    "i.e. , for arbitrary @xmath0 , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the work reported here , we do not make use of spin - wave theory or any other microscopic method . rather , our approach relies on the effective lagrangian technique which systematically captures the low - energy physics of the system that is governed by the goldstone bosons .",
    "low energy  or low temperature  means that we are interested in the properties of the system below the intrinsic scale defined by the underlying microscopic model . in connection with the heisenberg antiferromagnet or the quantum xy model ,",
    "this scale is given by the exchange coupling @xmath4 .",
    "note that the spontaneously broken rotation symmetry o(@xmath0 ) is only approximate , since we incorporate a weak external field into the low - energy description .",
    "as we discuss below , this field can not be completely switched off in two spatial dimensions in the effective approach we pursue in the present study .",
    "the @xmath2=2 + 1 quantum xy model ( @xmath0=2 ) and the @xmath2=2 + 1 heisenberg antiferromagnet ( @xmath0=3 ) turn out to be rather peculiar cases : they represent the only systems where the spin - wave - interaction contribution in the pressure is repulsive at low temperatures in the entire parameter regime where our effective analysis applies .",
    "furthermore , considering the impact of the spin - wave interaction in the staggered magnetization and susceptibility , the low - temperature behavior of the @xmath2=2 + 1 quantum xy model is quite different from any other @xmath2=2 + 1 ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant system with a spontaneously broken internal rotation symmetry o(@xmath0 ) : it is the only system where the interaction contribution in the staggered magnetization ( susceptibility ) tends to positive ( negative ) values at low temperatures and weak external field .",
    "interestingly , for systems with @xmath5 the staggered magnetization ( susceptibility ) also becomes positive ( negative ) at very low temperatures and not too weak external fields .",
    "this means that here the goldstone boson interaction at finite temperature tends to reinforce the antialignment of the spins and enhances the staggered spin pattern .",
    "we emphasize that the physical realizations for @xmath0=\\{2,3 } are not restricted to quantum magnetism .",
    "rather , any two - dimensional system with a spontaneously broken rotation symmetry , o(3 ) @xmath1 o(2 ) , or o(2 ) @xmath1 1 , exhibits the same characteristic features determined by the universal physics of its goldstone bosons .",
    "most remarkably , the question of whether the goldstone boson interaction in the pressure and the other observables we consider , is repulsive or attractive at low temperatures , applies to any @xmath2=2 + 1 ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant system that exhibits a spontaneously broken rotation symmetry . in this sense ,",
    "our results on the nature of the goldstone boson interaction are universal . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our three - loop results are far beyond any analogous calculation based on more conventional condensed matter methods like spin - wave theory .    regarding the @xmath2=2 + 1 quantum xy model and the heisenberg antiferromagnet , high - precision measurements based on very efficient loop - cluster algorithms",
    "have been performed recently in refs .",
    "these numerical results were confronted with analytic calculations obtained within effective lagrangian theory .",
    "not only were some combinations of low - energy constants determined at the permille level , but also was the correctness of the systematic effective lagrangian method demonstrated .    in order to convince the interested reader that the effective lagrangian technique indeed represents a very powerful machinery in the condensed matter domain , we point out the following additional references which are all based on that method . ferromagnets and antiferromagnets in one , two , and three spatial dimensions",

    "the basic degrees of freedom in the effective lagrangian are the @xmath0 - 1 goldstone bosons , which result from the spontaneously broken rotation symmetry o(@xmath0 ) @xmath1 o(@xmath0 - 1 ) .",
    "these goldstone boson fields are collected in a @xmath0-dimensional unit vector @xmath6 @xmath7 while the first @xmath0 - 1 components describe the goldstone bosons , the last component , @xmath8 guarantees that the vector @xmath9 is normalized to unity .",
    "the low - energy dynamics of the system , dominated by the goldstone bosons , is described by the following euclidean effective lagrangian : @xmath10 the different pieces in @xmath11 are organized according to the number of derivatives they contain .",
    "the leading contribution @xmath12 contains two space - time derivatives ( order @xmath13 ) , while the next - to - leading contribution @xmath14 is of order @xmath15 .",
    "the external field @xmath16 counts as a quantity of order @xmath13 .    a physical realization for @xmath0=2 and @xmath0=3",
    "is provided by the @xmath2=2 + 1 quantum xy model and the @xmath2=2 + 1 heisenberg antiferromagnet , respectively .",
    "the o(2 ) spin symmetry of the quantum xy hamiltonian , and the o(3 ) spin symmetry of the heisenberg hamiltonian , are spontaneously broken according to o(2 ) @xmath1 1 and o(3 ) @xmath1 o(2 ) , respectively .",
    "the goldstone bosons in these cases are identified with the spin waves or magnons , and the external field @xmath17 is the staggered field that couples to the staggered magnetization vector @xmath18 .",
    "note that there exists a mapping between the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic quantum xy model on a bipartite lattice , such that for @xmath0=2 the external field may also be interpreted as the magnetic field that couples to the magnetization vector @xmath18 of the quantum xy ferromagnet .",
    "it should be stressed that the effective description is universal , in the sense that any two ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant systems that display the same internal and space - time symmetries , will be described by the same effective lagrangian .",
    "but while the structure of the effective lagrangian is the same , the difference between two distinct physical realizations manifests itself in the actual numerical values of the low - energy coupling constants @xmath19 .",
    "symmetry leaves these effective constants undetermined , such that they have to be extracted from a numerical simulation , by comparison with the microscopic calculation , or by experiment . in the context of quantum spin systems , @xmath20 is referred to as helicity modulus or spin stiffness , while @xmath21 is the staggered magnetization at zero temperature .",
    "an important point to emphasize is that the effective lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ leff ] ) , is written in a lorentz - invariant form .",
    "one may thus be very skeptical about its applicability to the @xmath2=2 + 1 quantum xy model or the heisenberg antiferromagnet , whose underlying two - dimensional lattices are not even invariant under continuous space rotations .",
    "first of all , the leading piece @xmath12 does not depend on the specific geometry ",
    "the lattice structure only starts manifesting itself at subleading orders in the effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath12 may be written in a ( pseudo)-lorentz - invariant form , where the spin - wave velocity takes over the role of the velocity of light .",
    "note that ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariance is an accidental symmetry of @xmath12 , and is not present in the microscopic xy or heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "as far as the next - to - leading piece @xmath14 is concerned , indeed , lattice anisotropies start to show up at this order : these contributions are still invariant under the discrete spatial symmetries of the lattice , but break continuous space rotation invariance and thus ( pseudo-)lorentz invariance . as will become clear in the next section , these extra contributions do not affect our conclusions concerning the impact of the spin - wave interaction in thermodynamic quantities .",
    "in other words , it is perfectly safe for our purposes to also write @xmath14 in a ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant form .",
    "since we are dealing with relativistic kinematics , the external field @xmath22 induces a mass term  or energy gap  in the dispersion relation of the goldstone bosons , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the spin - wave velocity .",
    "the low - energy degrees of freedom are then referred to as pseudo - goldstone bosons .",
    "as long as the external field @xmath22 , and therefore @xmath25 , are small compared to the intrinsic scale occurring in the underlying microscopic model , these quantities may be treated as perturbations within the effective lagrangian framework . in the case of the quantum xy model or the heisenberg antiferromagnet ,",
    "this scale is given by the exchange integral @xmath4 that appears in the corresponding microscopic hamiltonians .",
    "the evaluation of the partition function for ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant systems , defined in two spatial dimensions and exhibiting a spontaneously broken symmetry o(@xmath0 ) @xmath1 o(@xmath0 - 1 ) , has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite within effective lagrangian field theory up to the three - loop level . in order not to be repetitive , here",
    "we restrict ourselves to a minimum of information  just to understand the subsequent discussion .",
    "up to three - loop order , one has to evaluate the eight feynman diagrams depicted in fig.[figure1 ] .",
    "we should stress that we are dealing with a systematic loop expansion of the partition function , where each goldstone boson loop is suppressed by one power of momentum . the two - loop graph 4b , compared to the one - loop graph 3 ,",
    "is suppressed by one additional power of @xmath26 .",
    "the three - loop graphs 5a - c , on the other hand , are suppressed by two additional powers of momentum compared to graph 3 , such that they are of next - to - next - to leading order @xmath27 .",

    "let us explain what we mean by _ nature _ of the goldstone boson interaction .",
    "first of all , we refer to a diagrammatic definition of the interaction .",

    "the interaction manifests itself at two - loop order @xmath15 ( diagram 4b ) and at three loop - order @xmath27 ( diagrams 5a - c ) .",
    "then we adopt a thermodynamically motivated interpretation of the interaction , which refers to the sign of the interaction contribution in the low - temperature series of the various quantities we consider  this is what we mean by _ nature _ of goldstone boson interaction . regarding the pressure ,",

    "we should point out in which parameter regime  defined by @xmath3 , @xmath22 ( or @xmath32 ) , @xmath67 , @xmath4  the effective series are valid . to explore this domain",

    "this quantity has been measured in high - precision monte carlo simulations , both for the @xmath2=2 + 1 quantum xy model and the @xmath2=2 + 1 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice , with the result @xcite : @xmath72 here the underlying scale  the exchange constant @xmath4 of the microscopic theory  can thus be expressed in terms of the effective coupling constant @xmath67 as @xmath73 @xcite .",

    "qcd is characterized by a chiral phase transition taking place at @xmath75 where the goldstone boson picture definitely ceases to be valid .",
    "compared to the scale of qcd , @xmath76 , we obtain the ratio @xmath77 if we define low temperature in relation to the critical temperature , let us say , @xmath78 , in terms of the qcd scale , low temperature means @xmath79 returning to our systems in @xmath2=2 + 1 with a spontaneously broken rotation symmetry , we conclude that the low - temperature region where the effective expansion applies , is given by @xmath80 in order to check consistency , consider the @xmath2=2 + 1 quantum xy model that is characterized by the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition which marks the breakdown of the spin - wave picture . on the square lattice ,",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless transition occurs at @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "if we define low temperature again in relation to the critical temperature , @xmath82 , in terms of the microscopic scale @xmath4 , we get @xmath83 which is perfectly consistent with eq .",
    "( [ rangetj ] ) .",
    "regarding the magnitude of the goldstone boson mass ( and hence the external field @xmath22 ) , recall that in qcd the pion masses are roughly @xmath84 , leading to the ratio @xmath85 in fact , the effective theory of qcd even works for kaon masses ( @xmath86 ) and the @xmath87-mass ( @xmath88 )  these particles , much like the pions , represent goldstone bosons .",
