    "the discovery of charmonium in november 1974 marked the beginning of the modern era of particle physics . within a few years , 10 charmonium states had been discovered .",
    "these states are shown in fig .",

    "the charmonium states below the @xmath1 threshold at 3729 mev were the @xmath3 ground state @xmath4 , the @xmath5 states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 states @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the only complete charmonium multiplet was the @xmath14 multiplet consisting of @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath0 mesons above the @xmath1 threshold were four @xmath5 states : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , which can be identified as members of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 charmonium multiplets .",
    "there were no definitive discoveries of any new @xmath0 mesons for more than 20 years .",
    "the @xmath2 factories , which began operating near the beginning of the century , have turned out to be surprisingly effective machines for studying @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the new @xmath0 mesons discovered since 2002 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "there are now three complete multiplets below the @xmath1 threshold : @xmath14 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . above the @xmath1 threshold",
    "there are four new @xmath5 charmonium states , a @xmath9 state called the @xmath25 , the @xmath10 state @xmath26 , and three states whose @xmath27 quantum numbers are not yet known .",
    "in addition , there is a charged @xmath0 meson called @xmath28 .",
    "these new states provide a challenge to our understanding of qcd .",
    "there are several recent reviews of the new @xmath0 mesons @xcite .",
    "i will describe three of the discoveries in more detail .",
    "the @xmath25 was discovered by the belle collaboration in november 2003 through the decay @xmath29 followed by @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the discovery has been confirmed by the cdf , babar , and d0 collaborations @xcite .",
    "the mass of the @xmath25 is @xmath31 .",
    "its width is less than 2.3 mev at the 90% confidence level @xcite .",
    "its quantum numbers are strongly preferred to be @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "there are two puzzling properties of the @xmath25 that indicate that it is not an ordinary charmonium state :    its decays violate isospin symmetry .",
    "the discovery decay mode @xmath32 is dominated by @xmath6 and a virtual @xmath33 meson , which is a final state with @xmath34 .",
    "however the decay of @xmath35 into @xmath36 has also been observed with a comparable branching fraction @xcite .",
    "this decay is dominated by @xmath6 and a virtual @xmath37 meson , which is a final state with @xmath38 .    its measured mass depends on the decay channel .",
    "the measured mass in the @xmath39 decay channel is higher than in the @xmath32 channel by @xmath40 mev @xcite .",
    "four new @xmath5 @xmath0 mesons have been discovered by the belle and babar collaborations through the initial state radiation process @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath43 were discovered through their decays into @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath44 and @xmath45 were discovered through their decays into @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "they do not seem to be ordinary @xmath5 charmonium states , because no resonant peaks are observed in the inclusive @xmath47 cross section at these energies .",
    "there are also no resonant peaks in the exclusive @xmath47 cross sections into @xmath1 , @xmath48 , or @xmath49 , in spite of the masses being well above the thresholds for these decays .",
    "the @xmath50 was discovered by the belle collaboration in august 2007 through the decay @xmath51 followed by @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "its mass and width are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "its @xmath55 quantum numbers are not known , but it has @xmath56 . since the decay products @xmath7 and @xmath57 have constituents @xmath0 and @xmath58 , respectively",
    ", the @xmath59 must have constituents @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath50 is a manifestly exotic meson .",
    "what are the new @xmath0 mesons above the @xmath1 threshold ? some of them could be ordinary charmonium ( @xmath0 ) , but some of them are definitely exotic mesons .",
    "the exotic possibilities include charmonium hybrids ( @xmath61 ) , tetraquark mesons ( @xmath62 , and sexaquark mesons ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "a tetraquark meson could be a compact color - singlet state , but it could also have substructure .",
    "the possible substructures consisting of two clusters include charm meson molecules , diquark ",
    "antidiquark states , and hadro - charmonium .",
    "i will discuss several of these possibilities in more detail .",
    "potential models are a phenomenological framework for charmonium that is well developed in most respects .",
    "the exception is the effect of couplings to charm meson pairs , which are essential for accurate predictions above the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "updated predictions for the charmonium spectrum from potential models have been given by barnes , godfrey , and swanson @xcite and by eichten , lane , and quigg @xcite .",
    "the missing charmonium states ( and their quantum numbers ) include    one member of the @xmath20 multiplet : @xmath64 ( @xmath3 ) ,    three members of the @xmath65 multiplet : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath69 ) ,    three members of the @xmath19 multiplet : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ) .",
    "there are also entire missing multiplets : @xmath22 , @xmath76 , @xmath21 ,  .",
    "the missing charmonium states are shown as open boxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "while some of the new @xmath0 mesons lie close to the predicted mass of a missing charmonium state , most of them do not .",
    "charm meson molecules are tetraquark @xmath0 mesons that consist of a pair of charm mesons ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 )",
    ". the interactions of the charm mesons are constrained by experimental data .",
    "the first quantitative predictions for the spectrum of charm meson molecules were made by tornqvist in 1991 @xcite .",
    "he used a meson potential model with one - pion - exchange interactions and an ultraviolet cutoff on the @xmath79 potential that was tuned to reproduce the binding energy of the deuteron .",
    "tornqvist predicted charm meson molecules near threshold in several @xmath27 channels with @xmath38 :    for @xmath1 , whose threshold is at 3729 mev , there should be none .    for @xmath80",
    ", there should be molecules near the threshold at 3872 mev in the @xmath3 and @xmath9 channels .    for @xmath49 , there should be molecules near the threshold at 4014 mev in the @xmath8 , @xmath81 , @xmath69 , and @xmath10 channels .",
    "tornqvist essentially predicted the @xmath25 in 1994 , although he did not anticipate the importance of the isospin splittings between @xmath82 and @xmath83 and between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "updated predictions of a meson potential model have been given by swanson @xcite .",
    "he tuned the ultraviolet cutoff on the @xmath79 potential to obtain the observed mass of the @xmath25 , and he also included quark - exchange interactions . besides the @xmath25 , whose binding energy was used as an input , the only other molecular state that is predicted to be bound is a @xmath8 @xmath49 state at 4013 mev .",
    "the meson potential model can also be applied to bottom meson molecules .",
    "there should be two @xmath86/@xmath87 molecules ( @xmath81 and @xmath9 ) and four @xmath88 molecules ( @xmath8 , @xmath81 , @xmath69 , and @xmath10 ) .",
    "swanson predicts their binding energies to range from 40 to 70 mev .",
    "one of the possible substructures for a tetraquark @xmath0 meson is a diquark ( @xmath89 ) and an antidiquark ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the problem can be dramatically simplified by treating the constituent diquarks as point particles .",
    "this approach has been followed by maiani , piccinini , polosa , and riquer @xcite , by ishida , ishida , and maeda @xcite , by ebert , faustov , and galkin @xcite , and by karliner and lipkin @xcite .",
    "the most attractive color channel for a constituent diquark @xmath89 is @xmath91 .",
    "if the diquark has no internal orbital angular momentum , it has two possible states @xmath92 and @xmath93 corresponding to total spin 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the possible s - wave tetraquarks ( and their quantum numbers ) are @xmath94 ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 , @xmath69 ) , and @xmath97 ( @xmath8 , @xmath69 , @xmath10 ) . for each of these 6 states",
    ", there is a flavor multiplet .",
    "if we consider the three light quarks @xmath98 , the flavor multiplet consists of 9 states .",
    "if we only consider two light quarks @xmath99 , the flavor multiplet consists of 4 states : an isospin triplet @xmath100 and an isospin singlet @xmath101 .    one problem with the interpretation of new @xmath0 mesons as diquark ",
    "antidiquark bound states is that too many other such states are predicted . if we only consider diquarks with color @xmath91 and take the diquark ",
    "antidiquark system to be in its lowest state , @xmath102 states are predicted .",
    "there are many additional states if we also consider diquarks in the @xmath103 color state or if we allow orbital - angular - momentum or radial excitations of the diquark  antidiquark system . with all these possible states , it is easy to fit the mass of any new @xmath0 meson above the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "the challenge is then to explain why all the other predicted states have not been observed .",
    "one way to avoid predicting too many tetraquark states is to start from the 4-body problem for constituent quarks .",
    "vijande , valcarce , et al .",
    "@xcite and hiyama , suganama , and kamimura @xcite have solved this 4-body problem numerically .",
    "they have shown that there are no stable @xmath104 states with only 2-body color - dependent forces .",
    "a more fundamental approach to the problem of predicting the spectrum of tetraquark mesons is to use qcd sum rules to determine the most attractive channels .",
    "navarra , nielsen , et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the qcd sum rules are consistent with tetraquark states in channels associated with several of the new @xmath0 mesons , including @xmath25 and @xmath50 .",
    "the spectrum of tetraquark @xmath0 mesons should eventually be calculable using lattice qcd .",
    "one problem is that dynamical light quarks are essential for calculating the spectrum of @xmath0 mesons above the @xmath1 threshold and this makes the calculations computationally demanding .",
    "the easiest masses to calculate are those for states with exotic quantum numbers .",
    "the calculations for states with the same quantum numbers as excited charmonium states are much more difficult .",
    "charmonium hybrids are @xmath0 mesons in which the gluon field is in an excited state .",
    "if the excitation of the gluon field is interpreted as a constituent gluon , the constituents of the charmonium hybrid are @xmath61 .",
    "however there is no reason to expect the excitation of the gluon field to have particle - like behavior .",
    "the spectrum of charmonium hybrids has been calculated using lattice gauge theory .",
    "the masses obtained thus far are not definitive , because they have been calculated without dynamical light quarks . the spectrum was calculated using a born - oppenheimer approximation by juge , kuti , morningstar @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the lowest multiplet consists of degenerate states with the quantum numbers @xmath3 , @xmath105 , @xmath5 , @xmath9 , @xmath69 , @xmath106 , @xmath75 , and @xmath107 .",
    "their result for the mass is approximately 4200 mev .",
    "the energies of charmonium hybrids with exotic quantum numbers have been calculated using conventional lattice gauge theory by liao and manke @xcite and by liu and luo @xcite .",
    "their results for the masses of the lowest states with the exotic quantum numbers @xmath106 , @xmath105 , and @xmath107 are 4400 , 4700 , and 4900 mev , respectively .",
    "since the lowest born - oppenheimer multiplet includes a @xmath5 state , there should also be a @xmath5 state in this mass range .",
    "the masses of the new @xmath5 states @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are compatible with this mass range .",
    "an important selection rule for the decays of charmonium hybrids has been derived by isgur , kokoski , and paton @xcite , by close and page @xcite , and by kou and pene @xcite .",
    "decays of a charmonium hybrid into two s - wave charm mesons , namely @xmath1 , @xmath48 , @xmath108 , or @xmath49 , are suppressed .",
    "thus its dominant decay modes are expected to be into a p - wave charm meson and an s - wave charm meson , such as @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the new @xmath5 @xmath0 mesons @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 have only been observed in either the @xmath111 or @xmath112 decay channels . despite the large phase space available ,",
    "these states have not been seen in the decay modes @xmath1 , @xmath48 , or @xmath49 .",
    "this makes them prime condidates for charmonium hybrids .",
    "dubynskiy and voloshin have recently proposed a new possibility for the substructure of tetraquark @xmath0 mesons : hadro - charmonium , which consists of a charmonium @xmath113 ( @xmath0 ) and a light meson @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) @xcite .",
    "this possibility is motivated by the multipole expansion for the long - wavelength gluon fields that dominate the interaction between @xmath113 and @xmath114 at long distances .",
    "they pointed out that this interaction is attractive and they suggested that it might be strong enough to form a bound state .",
    "a hadro - charmonium @xmath116 is expected to have substantial decay rates into final states consisting of @xmath113 and decay modes of @xmath114 .",
    "several of the new @xmath0 mesons have been observed to decay into final states that include @xmath6 but not @xmath7 or vice versa .",
    "this pattern is easily explained if these states are hadro - charmonia .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which decay into @xmath111 , might be hadro - charmonium states containing a @xmath6 , while @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which decay via @xmath112 , might be hadro - charmonium states containing a @xmath7 . the @xmath50 , which decays into @xmath117 , might be a hadro - charmonium state containing @xmath7 .",
    "the nature of the @xmath25 can be determined unambiguously from the combination of two crucial experimental inputs :    its mass is extremely close to the @xmath118 threshold : @xmath119    its quantum numbers are @xmath120 .",
    "the determination is based on the remarkable universal properties of nonrelativistic particles with short - range interactions that have an s - wave resonance near the threshold @xcite .",
    "the universal properties are determined by the large s - wave scattering length or , equivalently , by the small binding energy .",
    "the first fact above implies that the @xmath25 has an s - wave coupling to @xmath118 .",
    "the second fact above implies that it is a resonant coupling .",
    "we can conclude that @xmath25 is a charm meson molecule ( bound state or virtual state ) whose meson structure is @xmath121 an example of the universal properties is a simple relation between the mean separation of the constituents @xmath122 and the binding energy @xmath123 : @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the reduced mass .",
    "this implies that if @xmath126 mev , @xmath127 fm .",
    "thus the constituent mesons in the @xmath25 are usually well separated .",
    "this determination of the nature of the @xmath25 provides simple explanations for the two puzzling features described in section  [ x3872 ] :    the violation of isospin symmetry in decays of the @xmath25 is explained by its mass being much closer to the @xmath118 threshold than to the @xmath128 threshold , which is higher by about 8 mev . as a consequence , the meson state of the @xmath25 , which is given in eq .",
    "( [ xwf ] ) , is an equal superposition of @xmath38 and @xmath34 .",
    "the larger mass of @xmath35 measured in the @xmath39 decay channel compared to the @xmath32 channel is explained by the difference between the line shapes in those two channels .",
    "the line shape from @xmath129 is the combination of a resonance below the @xmath118 threshold from @xmath130 and a threshold enhancement above the @xmath118 threshold from @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "the line shape from @xmath132 has only the resonance below the @xmath118 threshold .",
    "thus its peak represents the true mass of the @xmath25 resonance .",
    "an analysis of the belle data on @xmath132 and @xmath129 favors the @xmath25 being a bound state whose mass is below the @xmath118 threshold @xcite , although a virtual state whose mass is above the @xmath118 threshold is not excluded @xcite .",
    "other properties of the @xmath133 can be deduced by taking into account charged charm meson pairs , whose threshold is only about 8 mev higher than that of the neutral charm meson pair @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the production rates of @xmath133 in @xmath134 and @xmath135 decays can be expressed as @xcite @xmath136}{\\gamma[b^+ \\to k^+ + x ] } = \\left| \\frac{\\gamma_1}{\\gamma_1 - \\kappa_1 } \\right|^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath137 mev and @xmath138 is the inverse scattering length for @xmath48 in the @xmath34 channel .",
    "this result supercedes an incorrect prediction by braaten and kusunoki that this ratio should be much less than 1 @xcite .",
    "the line shape from @xmath139 should have a zero about 6 mev above the @xmath118 threshold , while that for @xmath140 should have a zero about 2 mev below the @xmath118 threshold @xcite .",
    "this result supercedes an incorrect prediction by voloshin @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the line shapes from @xmath141 and @xmath142 should have no zeroes in the @xmath48 threshold region .",
    "my main conclusions on the new @xmath0 mesons are as follows :    the @xmath25 is a weakly - bound charm meson molecule whose meson content is given in eq .",
    "( [ xwf ] ) .",
    "it has universal properties that are determined by its small binding energy and are otherwise insensitive to details of qcd , including the mechanism for the binding of the charm mesons .",
    "the new @xmath5 mesons @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are good candidates for charmonium hybrids .",
    "this interpretation could be confirmed by observing their decays into @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath50 is an exotic tetraquark meson with quark content @xmath60 .",
    "they are the charged members of an isospin multiplet @xmath143 .",
    "the implications of this state for other @xmath0 mesons depends on its @xmath55 quantum numbers , which have not yet been determined .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath50 provide existence proofs for exotic @xmath0 mesons . by heavy quark symmetry , replacing the charm quarks by bottom quarks decreases the kinetic energy without significantly changing the potential energy .",
    "this implies that exotic @xmath144 mesons should also exist and have larger binding energies .",
