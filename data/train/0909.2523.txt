    "by linearizing the field equations around a monopole solution , brandt and neri @xcite and coleman @xcite have shown that most non - abelian monopoles are _ unstable _ with respect to small perturbations , unless all eigenvalues , @xmath1 , of the non - abelian charge , @xmath2 , ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) satisfy the `` brandt - neri condition '' q=0 .",
    "[ 1.1 ] goddard and olive @xcite prove then that the semisimple part of @xmath2 must be of a very special form , known in representation theory as a `` minimal vector '' or a  minimal co - weight `` '' ( see secs . 2 and 4 for details ) .",
    "asymptotic monopoles with residual group @xmath6 behave very much like pure yang - mills theory on @xmath7 with gauge group @xmath6 .",
    "the solutions of the yang - mills ( ym ) equations are again characterized by a @xmath2 .",
    "but ym on @xmath7 is just a special case of ym on a riemann surface , studied by atiyah and bott @xcite .",
    "it follows then from the general theory that most solutions are unstable , and admit rather = 2_q<0 ( 2|q|-1 ) [ 1.2 ] negative modes , where the sum goes over all negative eigenvalues @xmath8 of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath9 is always an integer because @xmath10 is a charge ( see below ) .",
    "the zero eigenvalues do not appear in the sum in ( [ 1.2 ] ) and the eigenvalues @xmath11 do not contribute .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) is hence consistent with the brandt - neri condition ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to relate and complete the above results . after summarizing the necessary algebraic tools ( and in particular the basic properties of minimal co - weights ) ,",
    "we review those properties of finite - energy configurations ( sec . 3 ) and of solutions ( sec .",
    "4 ) which are relevant for our purposes . much of the content of these sections is already known @xcite but we have assembled the results from different sources and summarized them for completeness and for the convenience of the reader .",
    "as well - known , monopoles fall into topological sectors separated by infinite energy barriers and labelled by homotopy classes in @xmath12 of @xmath6 , the residual group after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "we show that , for any compact and connected @xmath6 , each topological sector contains a unique `` minimal '' charge , @xmath13 , i.e. one whose semi - simple part is a minimal co - weight .",
    "minimal charges are thus introduced here independently of stability considerations , as _ labels of the topological sectors_.    monopoles are critical points of the yang - mills energy functional .",
    "our first approach to instability is _ local _ in the sense that it only involves the behaviour of the energy functional in the neighbourhood of a critical point .",
    "this behaviour is characterized by the second variation , called the hessian . more generally , if a field @xmath14 is a critical point of some energy functional @xmath15 , then @xmath16 for any variation @xmath17 .",
    "the expansion e(+)=e()+^2e(,)+(^3 ) [ 1.3 ] shows then that @xmath14 is locally stable if the hessian has no negative eigenvalues .",
    "having a negative value would mean in fact that the excitation @xmath17 has negative mass - square , i.e. the energy of the configuration @xmath14 could be reduced by tachyon formation .",
    "geometrically , the energy is an ( infinite - dimensional ) surface over finite - energy configurations , and the stability of a critical point depends on the shape of the surface , cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] .        in this paper",
    "we restrict our attention to those asymptotic variations of the gauge field alone previously considered by brandt and neri @xcite and by coleman @xcite . we show that for non - zero higgs potentials the @xmath18-dimensional problem essentially reduces to pure ym theory on @xmath7 .",
    "other types of variations may also lead to instability .",
    "for example , a multicharged configuration can dissociate into single monopoles @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian charge @xmath2 is kept fixed under such a process .",
    "our problem here is therefore different : we inquire about the stability of the charge @xmath2 itself .",
    "more precisely , we want to know whether a configuration with charge @xmath19 can decay into another one , whose charge is @xmath20 .",
    "thus the relevance of the problem studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is that , in multiply - charged topological sectors , the vacuum itself may not exist i.e. there are no static solutions to the field equations ( the energy has an infimum but no minimum ) . such a situation would , of course , reduce the importance of our results .",
    "it seems , though , to be rather exceptional @xcite .",
    "another interesting type of monopole instability is the one studied by taubes @xcite , whose results concern prasad - sommerfield monopoles .",
    "they correspond to variations of the higgs field rather than to those of the gauge field .",
    "our results here are complementary to these aspects .    for @xmath7 ,",
    "the general theory of atiyah and bott @xcite can be related to the brandt - neri - coleman rotation - group approach .",
    "indeed , on the @xmath1-eigenspace the interesting part of the hessian is drd\\{\\{(^2-q(q+1 ) ) } } + qdrd ( ) ^2 , [ 1.4 ] where @xmath21 is the casimir of the angular momentum vector @xmath22 of the spin-@xmath23 field @xmath24 .",
    "since the first term is non - negative and the first non - zero eigenvalue is at least @xmath25 , a negative mode can occur only if the first term in ( [ 1.4 ] ) vanishes and the second is negative , which only happens if q-1 j=|q|-1 . [ 1.5 ] from this result it is evident that the negative modes form a @xmath26 dimensional @xmath27 multiplet .",
    "a simple way of counting the number of negative modes is to use the diagram introduced by bott @xcite .",
    "the special form ( [ 1.4 ] ) of the hessian makes it possible to construct the negative modes explicitly : in terms of the complex ( stereographic ) coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 on @xmath7 , they are given (    c a _ + 0    ) = ^k(1+z)^-|q|e _ + 0 , 0 + a_z = 0 + z^k(1+z)^-|q|e_- [ 1.6 ] @xmath30 , where the @xmath31 s are those eigenvectors of @xmath32 $ ] with eigenvalues @xmath33 . the positive modes ( @xmath34 states )",
    "may be constructed by the same technique .    in the brandt - neri case @xmath35 or @xmath36",
    "there are _ no _ @xmath37 states , and the monopole is _ stable_.",
    "it follows from the topological formulation that , for any compact @xmath6 , the only charge which satisfies this condition is @xmath2 itself .",
    "physically , in each topological sector , @xmath2 minimizes the energy in the coulomb tail @xcite .",
    "the integrand in the hessian is essentially a _",
    "supersymmetric hamiltonian _ on @xmath7 , and the negative modes correspond to its ground state , whose multiplicity ( called the _ witten index _ ) is exactly the instability index @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this is also the _ atiyah - singer index _ for vectors on @xmath7 .    for bogomolny - prasad - sommerfield monopoles",
    "@xcite there is an extra term @xmath39 in the hessian due to the long - range higgs field , which cancels the corresponding term in ( [ 1.4 ] ) and the relevant part of the hessian is rather dr d(^2 ) , [ 1.7 ] which is manifestly positive .",
    "it follows that bps monopoles are _ stable _ with respect to variations of the gauge field alone .",
    "( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another intuitive way of understanding monopole instability is by thinking of them as _ elastic strings _",
    "@xcite : _ monopoles decay just like strings shrink to shorter configurations _ ( actually to the shortest one allowed by the topology ) . remarkably , this analogy can be made rigorous .",
    "indeed , the well - known expression h^a()=p ( _ _ ) , [ 1.8 ] where @xmath40 is a @xmath23-parameter family of loops sweeping through the two - sphere , associates a loop in the residual group @xmath6 to any ym potential @xmath41 on @xmath7 .",
    "the map ( [ 1.8 ] ) has been used before @xcite for describing the topological sector of a monopole .",
    "it contains however much more information : as a matter of fact , it puts _ all _ homotopy groups of finite - energy ym configurations and of loops in @xmath6 in a ( 1 - 1 ) correspondence @xcite .",
    "the energy of a loop in @xmath6 can be defined ( sec .",
    "7 ) and a variational calculus , analogous to ym on @xmath7 , can be developed ( this is in fact a kind of  @xmath23-dimensional @xmath42-model ) .",
    "remarkably , the map ( [ 1.8 ] ) carries monopoles i.e. critical points of the ymh functional , into geodesics , which are critical points of the loop - energy functional .",
    "furthermore , the number of instabilities is also the same , namely ( [ 1.2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "these facts are explained by morse theory @xcite : the energy functionals of both ym on @xmath7 and of loops in @xmath6 are `` perfect morse functions '' , and so their critical points correspond to changes in the topology of the underlying space @xcite .",
    "but the map ( [ 1.8 ] ) is a homotopy equivalence @xcite , so all topological properties of the two spaces are the same .",
    "a convenient choice of the @xmath40 s allows also to recover the loop - negative modes ( explicitly constructed in sec .",
    "7 ) as images of the ym - modes ( [ 1.6 ] ) .    after these local considerations",
    "we investigate the _ global _ properties .",
    "what happens in fact to an unstable monopole  ?",
    "although it can not leave its topological sector , it can go into another state in the same sector , because all such configurations are separated only by finite energy .",
    "semiclassically , an unstable monopole will move as to decrease its energy .",
    "for example , a ball put to the top of a torus will roll down to another critical point ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "if this is again an unstable configuration , it will continue to roll until it arrives at a stable position .",
    "critical points correspond to non - vanishing classes in @xmath43 , the second homology group . @xmath44 for @xmath7 , while @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the torus . _",
    "_ ]    most saddle - points in field theories studied so far are associated to _",
    "_ ( hyper)_loops _ of field configurations @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that there are no non - contractible loops in our case .",
    "there are , however , non - contractible _ spheres_. in sec . 8 we construct _ energy reducing two - spheres _ between a given unstable configuration and certain other , lower - energy configurations",
    ". the number of independent two - spheres is half the number @xmath47 in ( [ 1.2 ] ) , and their tangent vectors at the top yield negative modes ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we also hope that our energy - reducing spheres provide some information on the possible _ routes of decay _ for the monopole .",
    "section 9 is devoted to examples .",
    "first we study the residual group @xmath48 @xcite and @xmath49 .",
    "another nice example is provided by @xmath50 , previously studied in higher - dimensional yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "a simple example where the special property of the stable charges ( mentioned above ) enters , is when the semisimple part @xmath6 is ( a covering of ) @xmath51 .",
    "let us consider a compact simple lie algebra @xmath52 and choose a cartan subalgebra @xmath53 .",
    "a root @xmath54 is a linear function on the complexified cartan algebra @xmath55 , and to each @xmath54 is associated a vector @xmath31 ( the familiar step operator ) from @xmath56 which satisfies , with any vector @xmath6 from @xmath55 , the relation = ( h)e _ .",
    "[ 2.1 ] there exists a set of primitive roots @xmath57 ( @xmath58 rank ) such that every positive root is a linear combination of the @xmath59 with non - negative integer coefficients i.e. @xmath60 for all @xmath54 .",

    "therefore , for each root @xmath71 and the @xmath72 s ( or the real combinations @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) form @xmath75 subalgebras of @xmath52 .    the _ primitive charges _",
    "@xmath76 are defined by q_i= h_i = h__i . [ 2.2 ]    the primitive charges form a natural ( nonorthogonal ) basis for the cartan algebra and by adding the @xmath31 s we get a basis for the lie algebra @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , the primitive charges and the @xmath77 form a basis for the real algebra @xmath52 . the integer combinations @xmath78 of the primitive charges form an @xmath79-dimensional lattice @xmath80 sitting in the cartan algebra .",

    "they are called co - weights @xcite and it is evident that they can be normalized so as to coincide with the conventional weights ( by choosing @xmath84 ) for all groups whose roots are of the same length , i.e. all groups except @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    the integer combinations @xmath87 form another lattice we denote by @xmath88 . since @xmath89 is always an integer , the @xmath90-lattice actually contains the primitive - charge lattice , @xmath91 .",

    "then the discussion started and went on for hours .",
    "in fact , we spent more time working on the tiny blackboard of the kitchen than in the discussion room ; we published joint papers with him without having ever entered his office !",
    "sidney coleman has been a true magician : in his celebrated erice lectures @xcite he could convey understanding , in a few words , to everyone , which no - one else could explain in dozens of pages .",
    "he also had a tremendous intuition and a sparkling sense of humour .",
    "an illustration : in his @xmath630 erice lecture he claims that _  every topological sector contains exactly one stable monopole charge \" _  but he only proves his statement in the most trivial particular case , namely that of residual symmetry group @xmath75  which almost never arises in physical applications : the most common examples are rather of the gut type , @xmath631 , with a continuous center",
    ".    his statement puzzled and angered us , and we wanted to find a general proof , valid for any compact lie group . and after about a year of hard work , we realized that the problem could in fact be solved by  factoring out the center and decomposing the resulting semisimple group into @xmath75 factors !",
    "we were so fascinated by this `` coincidence '' that we wrote to sidney coleman , asking if he was aware that his over - simplified idea contained in fact the germ of the general proof !",
    "his answer has also been typical :  `` i do not remember any more what i was aware of by that time ; you had better phone david olive or werner nahm who can tell you what i knew by that time ! ''",
    "another proof of his amazing intuition : in his lectures , coleman mentions that _ the decay of monopoles is analogous to the way elastic strings shrink_. in our paper , we have been able to make this idea rigorous , and work out the analogy between monopole decay with the energy - minimizing shrinking of loops in the residual group !      our original idea has been that our _ energy - reducing two - spheres _ might indicate preferential _ decay routes _ for an unstable monopole : starting from some given unstable configuration , it would `` roll down '' following these  routes \" to some lower - energy , `` less - unstable '' saddle point , producing a sort of `` cascade '' of decaying monopoles ending eventually in the vacuum .",
    "both of these shining stars of our younger years are now dead .",
    "but we want to reiterate our gratefulness for having been able to learn from them .",
    "we include therefore , as an _ hommage _ , photos of both of these - so different ! - people ."
