    "nowadays the electron bernstein waves ( ebws ) having no density cut - offs and effectively damped even at high electron cyclotron harmonics are considered as the most promising candidate to provide an auxiliary heating and current drive in a dense plasma of a spherical tokamaks and stellarators  @xcite .",
    "the ebw could be excited via direct conversion of x mode to bernstein mode in a vicinity of the upper hybrid resonance ( uhr ) or via so - called o - x - b scheme .",
    "the efficiency of last scheme , as it was demonstrated theoretically  @xcite in the frame of 1d slab model , is determined by the efficiency of o to x mode conversion , which can reach 100 percent value at the certain parallel refractive index being constant in slab geometry . due to , in a real spherical tokamak s configurations , where the poloidal inhomogeneity of the magnetic field is important , both the parallel refractive index is no longer constant and the components of the dielectric tensor are functions of two co - ordinates , an analysis of the full - wave equations in the frame of 2d model is important .",
    "the first attempt to consider 2d model of ox conversion has been undertaken a couple of years ago  @xcite . the main conclusion provided by author of  @xcite concerning the absence of the o mode reflection from the o - mode cut - off surface seems to be quite doubtful and lacks support from the last two papers devoted to this topic  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the ox mode conversion in  @xcite has been considered in the frame of the oversimplified model ignoring as it does both the poloidal magnetic field and , as result , varying of the parallel refractive index on the magnetic surface .",
    "these effects were taken into account in  @xcite , where the the explicit expressions for the ox and xo conversion coefficients have been obtained simultaneously with  @xcite but for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field and @xmath3 is an angle between the toroidal direction and the magnetic field ) .    unlike the assumption used in  @xcite , @xmath4 , in spherical tokamak s plasma @xmath3 is no longer small as it is demonstrated in figure 1 for a typical mast tokamak discharge . therefore ,",
    "straightforward using the results of  @xcite , without mentioning paper  @xcite , to describe ox conversion in spherical tokamaks seems to be overhasty . because of",
    "the intensive efforts are paid to provide an auxiliary heating in spherical tokamaks using oxb scheme , calculation of the ox conversion coefficient in the realistic 2d model is of great interest . in this paper a reduced set of the partial differential wave equations valid in a vicinity of the o - mode cutoff and accounting for the magnetic field 2d inhomogeneity with no restriction to an angle between the toroidal direction and the magnetic field are derived . a solution to the reduced set of equations",
    "has been obtained and it properties are considered in details .",
    "there are three effects that remain beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we neglect , first , the curvature of the magnetic field line at the magnetic surface because of its local radius @xmath5 is considerably greater than the beam radius @xmath6 , second , the curvature of the magnetic flux surfaces assuming high localization of the conversion region , third , the magnetic field shear which is not important for ox conversion  @xcite . we restrict ourselves to the case of not extremely strong plasma density inhomogeneity @xmath7 when geometrical optics can be applied except possibly near cut - off layer or possibly mode conversion layer .",
    "one introduces two cartesian co - ordinate systems @xmath8 and @xmath9 with distances scaled in the units @xmath10 and their origin located at the o - mode cut - off surface ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the co - ordinates @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 imitate the flux surface label , the poloidal and the toroidal co - ordinates , respectively , and axes @xmath14 and @xmath15 are along the magnetic field and perpendicular to it on the o - mode cut - off surface , respectively ( figure 3 ) . the transformation from @xmath12 , @xmath13 components to @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath17 components convenient to represent the maxwellian equations is @xmath18 one introduces the set of the wave equations for a monochromatic wave @xmath19 as @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are electron langmuir and cyclotron frequencies , respectively .",
    "since a domain in a vicinity of o - mode cut off surface beyond the tokamak mid - plane is of interest , one can expand the plasma parameters , namely density @xmath28 and magnetic field modulus @xmath29 , into the taylor serious at @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 are parameters being the first order quantity ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 is one being the second order quantity ( @xmath35 ) . in order to study the properties of the waves in the mode conversion region we keep in mind that the component @xmath36 is small compared to two others",
    "@xmath37 there . omitting in ( 2 ) the terms being higher order quantity than the first one obtains @xmath38 due to tokamak symmetry we may assume that the wave fields vary as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 being constant is large .",
    "we would like to construct a solution @xmath41 of the system ( 6 ) .",
    "to this end we look to develop the integral representation for required solutions of laplace integral type @xmath42 where @xmath43 is assumed analytic in some domain and the path of integration in the @xmath44 plane is such that the integrand vanishes rapidly at the ends of the contour @xmath45 or at infinity . next    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 we can not easily deal with the system ( 8) as it stands after transformation , but recalling the conclusions of 1d theory  @xcite that the effective conversion is possible if both @xmath49 @xmath33 and @xmath50 @xmath51 we may reduce it to a simpler form .",
    "expanding @xmath52 around @xmath53 and @xmath54 around @xmath55 we have found that @xmath56 and @xmath57 . keeping in ( 8) terms being the first order quantity one has @xmath58 where the explicit expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 could be found by varying ( 9 ) . making the backward transformation with respect to @xmath61 yields @xmath62 where the electric field s components @xmath63 obey the system of equations    @xmath64    introducing new notations @xmath65",
    "@xmath66 we read ( 13 ) in the compact form @xmath67    in order to make the first step in analysis of the electric field components behavior in the conversion region , we consider in the next section wkb solution to the system ( 14 ) , namely we focus on the quality analysis of the ray trajectory along which the energy of the incident beam of the ordinary ( or extraordinary ) waves is carried over .",
    "although in the mode conversion region the wkb approximation breaks down and a local full wave equations ( 14 ) to be solved , the ray trajectory analysis could be useful .",
    "the ray representation of the wave field in four dimensional ray phase space @xmath68 @xmath69 is governed by hamilton s equations : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the local dispersion relation and @xmath72 denotes the orbit parameter .",
    "since the general picture of the ray behavior in the two - dimensional subspace @xmath73 is of interest , let us re - parameterize @xmath74 , where @xmath75 . substituting ( 16 ) into ( 15 ) we obtain @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "the equations constituting ( 17 ) are coupled with @xmath78 being the coupled coefficient .",
    "one can introduce the normal co - ordinates @xmath79 reducing the system of equations ( 17 ) to two independent ones .",
    "the set of linear independent solutions for either of the two is @xmath80 the expressions ( 18 ) , which show the projections of hamiltonian rays on the ( @xmath81 ) plane , deserves a few comments .",
    "first , note the oscillatory behavior along the @xmath82 direction , while the @xmath83-motion displays the influence of a retarding force .",
    "second , due to @xmath84 oscillations along the @xmath82 direction are not to be clear - cut .",
    "third , we can anticipate the full wave solution to the set of equations ( 14 ) could be represented as the superposition of the eigenmodes intrinsic to the confining potential ( @xmath85 ) in the @xmath82 direction leading to oscillatory @xmath82 motion and the superposition of the linear independent parabolic cylinder functions along @xmath83 direction , which proper for the effective potential @xmath86 .",
    "the full - wave solution to the set of equations ( 14 ) is studied in the next section .",
    "we would like to obtain the appropriate particular solution of the system ( 14 ) matching to the wkb solution outside the mode conversion region @xmath87 where * e * is the polarization vector , @xmath88 is a set of eigen functions to be found , @xmath89 and @xmath90 correspond to incident o mode ( ox conversion ) and incident x mode ( xo conversion ) .",
    "with that end in view we introduce two possible functional substitutions  @xcite providing the identity of the equations constituting ( 14 ) @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 being required functions that satisfy the equations @xmath94 let us use the transformation @xmath95 where @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 , that makes the potential in the brackets in ( 22 ) symmetrical @xmath99 if @xmath100 ( see figure 4 ) then @xmath101 .",
    "seeking the solutions to ( 24 ) in the form @xmath102 where the definition for @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 and @xmath105 are hermitian polynomials , we obtain the equation for @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 are important for subsequent analysis we list theirs below expressing its argument @xmath110 explicitly @xmath111    the solutions @xmath106 and @xmath107 to ( 27 ) matching to the wkb solutions ( 19 ) for the incident ordinary and extraordinary waves ( see appendix a ) are @xmath112 where @xmath113 are an arbitrary constants , which we choose so that ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) fit the incident wkb wave outside the conversion layer .",
    "as it is demonstrated in appendix a @xmath114 and @xmath115 correspond to the incident ordinary and extraordinary waves , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath116 has meaning the length of an evanescence layer ( see the equation ( a.3 ) ) .",
    "its value depends on the mode s number @xmath117 and combination of the parameter s @xmath110 sign and the direction of the process ( see ( 28 ) ) .",
    "that is , first , either of the mode tunnels through an evanescence layer with the efficiency inherent itself , second , the conversion efficiency being in 1d model the invariant under the conversion s direction reversal and the poloidal position of the incident beam changing has no longer the same property in 2d inhomogeneous plasma .",
    "being mentioned for the first time in  @xcite for the oversimplified plasma model ignoring the poloidal magnetic field and confirmed in  @xcite for the reasonable plasma model accounting for the poloidal magnetic field @xmath118 this property depends entirely on the essential two - dimensional character of the waves .    inserting ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) into ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) and ( 11 ) after simple algebra we obtain an integral representation of solution to ( 6 ) @xmath119 where upper signs at @xmath120 correspond to the incident ordinary wave and lower signs correspond to the incident extraordinary wave .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath121 and @xmath122 are @xmath123 and @xmath124    while outside the mode conversion region at @xmath125 @xmath126 and @xmath127 match to the geometrical optics solutions that correspond to the wkb incident and conversed waves ( compare the first terms in the r.h.s .",
    "of ( a.1 ) and ( a.2 ) , ( a.6 ) and ( a.7 ) ) , the wkb asymptotics of @xmath128 and @xmath129 correspond to the wkb wave reflected from the evanescence layer ( see ( a.5 ) ) .",
    "it is possible to obtain asymptotic expansion of the solution for @xmath130 . for the incident ordinary wave at @xmath131 we have @xmath132",
    "last expressions recover the expressions for the electric field components derived in  @xcite for plasma with @xmath118 .",
    "for usual spherical tokamak s configuration o mode cut - off layer and the x mode cut - off layer cross at the small angle , i.e. @xmath133 . keeping only terms in ( 23 ) being zero and first order quantity with respect to the parameter @xmath78 we read it as @xmath134 then we simplify @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath12 is scaled in the units @xmath137 . comparing the asymptotic representation of @xmath138 for the argument @xmath139 and asymptotic representation of @xmath138 for the argument @xmath140 ( see appendix a ) we obtain an explicit expressions for the conversion coefficient , @xmath141 , ( in energy ) and reflection coefficient , @xmath142 , where the subscribes @xmath143 and @xmath144 correspond to the direction of the process @xmath145 and @xmath146 the coefficient @xmath147 is given by the expression @xmath148 where @xmath149 means the complex conjugation , @xmath150",
    "is given field distribution in the incident beam in the wkb region , @xmath11 and @xmath13 are scaled in @xmath151 and @xmath152 is a normalizing coefficient proportional to the beam intensity .",
    "the expressions ( 38 ) and ( 39 ) derived similar to ones obtained in  @xcite excepting the formula for @xmath153 given by ( 40 ) and deserve one comment .",
    "noting @xmath154 at the fixed @xmath78 , we could read the reciprocal relation for the conversion coefficients in 2d inhomogeneous plasma as @xmath155 where the argument @xmath156 is presented explicitly .",
    "for the first time the property ( 41 ) was mentioned in  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite it was proved for plasma with poloidal magnetic field @xmath157 .    for illustration , in figure 5 the conversion coefficient , @xmath158 , of an incident beam with transversal distribution @xmath159 calculated with the use of 1d model  @xcite ( dashed curve ) and the formula ( 38 ) ( solid curves ) for @xmath160 and different @xmath3 versus the dimensionless radius , @xmath161 , is shown .",
    "calculations are executed under conditions of ebw heating experiment in mast @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "rather strong variation of dependence presented in figure 5 with variation of @xmath3 is observed .",
    "the mode conversion of o mode to x mode have been examined in a spherical tokamak geometry for plasma with a cold plasma dielectic tensor .",
    "we have assumed the wavelengths are much shorter than the equilibrium plasma gradient length , @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we expect wkb approximation to apply except possibly near o - mode cut - off surface or mode conversion layer .",
    "expanding wave equations in the region near the intersection of o and x mode cut - off surfaces , one finds reduced wave equations appropriate for this region which depends on two coordinates , @xmath11 and the poloidal angle @xmath12 .",
    "we seek the required solution to the set of equations so that it matches to the wkb solution outside the mode conversion region .",
    "after functional substitution we have found the integral representations of the required solution .    to the case typical of a spherical tokamak s configuration for which the o mode cut - off layer and the x mode cut - off layer cross at the small angle we have been simplified the obtained integral representations of solution and found the wave fields and the conversion coefficients explicitly .",
    "we have shown that at the fixed poloidal position , i.e. fixed @xmath78 , the conversion coefficients obey the reciprocial relation ( 41 ) as it was shown earlier in the frame of the model neglecting the poloidal magnetic field  @xcite and of the model in which the poloidal magnetic field is assumed to be small , @xmath118",
    ".    the importance of 2d effects has been demonstrated by the example under the mast conditions .",
    "the work was supported by rfbr grants 04 - 02 - 16404 , 06 - 02 - 17212",
    "we pay our attention to the functions of the parabolic cylinder with different arguments and indices @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "let us begin from asymptotic expressions for the first one at two limits @xmath125 which describe the corresponding wkb solutions beyond the conversion layer .",
    "when the argument @xmath83 tends to @xmath168  @xcite @xmath169 while at @xmath170 @xmath171 the second term in ( a.2 ) is much smaller ( with factor @xmath172 ) compared to the first one .",
    "therefore the function @xmath166 in the wkb sense describes the wave approaching an evanescence layer from @xmath173 and conversed wave propagating from an evanescence layer to @xmath174 . comparing the coefficients at @xmath175 in ( a.1 ) and",
