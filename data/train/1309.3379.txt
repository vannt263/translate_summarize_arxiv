    "single - qubit and two - qubit quantum gates are the basic ingredients for universal quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "if the registers are spatially separated , the required entangling operations can be carried out by either using flying qubits  @xcite or by quantum state transfer ( qst ) along a quantum channel , usually modeled as a quantum spin chain in a one - dimensional lattice  @xcite .",
    "spin chains , however , are a rather mathematical concept , which does not always have a direct realization in a laboratory . nevertheless , efficient experimental quantum simulation methods to study their properties can be constructed and a common approach uses the internal and external degrees of freedom of trapped particles  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the use of cold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , where , in particular , the achievement of single - site addressing paves the way to precise initialization and system control  @xcite .",
    "the use of long , unmodulated chains has the drawback that almost all the chain modes are involved in the dynamical process . as a consequence",
    ", an initially localized wave packet will disperse along the full chain , which strongly affects the efficiency of the qst process . in order to avoid such a dispersive behavior ,",
    "various proposals have been made . the use of engineered hopping amplitudes between adjacent spins would allow perfect qst independent of the length of the chain  @xcite , but such an implementation would require a high control of the internal structure of the system , while , from the experimental point of view , it is desirable to deal with uniform couplings  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion can also be reduced by encoding the initial state in more than one site @xcite or introducing a topological field @xcite .",
    "an alternative method consists of weakly coupling the two extreme states , the sender and the receiver , to the bulk chain .",
    "this allows one to distinguish two different regimes : for very weak coupling , the bulk chain is used as an information bus which is never appreciably populated , and the probability amplitude of finding the excitation at the sender or receiver undergoes an effective rabi oscillation @xcite ; on the other hand , for nonperturbative end - point couplings , the relevant modes taking part in the quantum state dynamics reside mainly in the linear zone of the spectrum , thus , minimizing the effect of dispersion and allowing qst to occur in the so - called ballistic regime @xcite . fast entangling gates",
    "can also be built by requiring switchable couplings between qubits and the bus @xcite .",
    "a review of different qst strategies can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all the proposals mentioned above share a common feature : the local potential ( which , in the language of magnetic systems , corresponds to an external magnetic field ) is kept constant along the chain . while this is mathematically convenient , it is by no means always experimentally given . in this work",
    "we will show that the presence of a position - dependent potential can indeed help to transfer the quantum state along a chain without making use of any of the techniques listed above .",
    "that is , all the spin - spin coupling amplitudes can be kept constant , and we assume no need of any external control . while the requirement of locally modulated spin - spin coupling is something that experimentalists prefer to avoid , spatially modulated potentials naturally arise , for example , in optical lattices due to the gaussian profile of the laser beams or overlaying magnetic traps  @xcite .",
    "the model we study below is therefore suitable for experimental implementation in such a physical context and a schematic is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the spin hamiltonian model and its basic features ; in sec .",
    "[ results ] the results are analyzed and we discuss the optimal regimes for high - fidelity qst ; in sec .  [ exp ] a possible experimental implementation in optical lattices is proposed and , finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "the hamiltonian describing a chain of @xmath0 coupled spins ( xx chain ) in the presence of a non homogeneous external field is given by @xmath1 a relevant property of this hamiltonian is its symmetry with respect to the operator @xmath2 ( @xmath3=0 $ ] ) , which implies that the total number of spins up ( or down ) , that is , the total magnetization , is conserved . because of the site dependence of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ", it is generally not possible to diagonalize @xmath6 , and an analytical solution for the problem can not be found . on the other hand , as in the following we shall work in the single - particle subspace , the size of the hilbert space is equal to the number of sites of the chain , and the problem can be easily handled numerically .",
    "let us therefore first consider as an initial state @xmath7 , while all other spins are down . because of the conservation of the total magnetization described above and due to the finite inter - site coupling amplitudes , the excitation will start hopping between adjacent sites and the state will evolve into @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 .    the goal of a qst protocol is to let an initial state of the form @xmath12 is an eigenstate of @xmath6 , it will be sufficient for our purpose to study the conditions under which @xmath13 , or , in the language of excitations introduced before , we want to know if there exists a time @xmath14 such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "in order to get the overall qst fidelity for the system , in principle , one has to average over all the possible initial states ( that is , over all the possible combinations of @xmath18 and @xmath19 such that @xmath20 ) , but the only relevant parameter is in fact @xmath21 .",
    "let us briefly review the strategy to achieve high - fidelity quantum state transfer based on the weak coupling of the sender and receiver to the bulk chain [ @xmath22 in order to shed light on the underlying physics of the transfer .",
    "considering for the sake of simplicity and without any loss of generality @xmath0 even , the basic idea of the weak coupling approach is that the bulk chain behaves just like a bus which is ( almost ) never excited .",
    "this allows the source and the destination to undergo an effective rabi oscillation ( the length of the chain manifests itself in the rabi frequency ) , since the two extreme sites behave like a dimer . as discussed in @xcite , efficient qst",
    "can be reached either by exploiting the resonance of sender and receiver with an isolated level of the channel or by putting them out of resonance . in the first case ,",
    "an effective three - body oscillation is observed and one of the eigenmodes approximates @xmath23 or @xmath24 , with the sign being determined by the symmetry of the hamiltonian . in the latter case , there are two eigenmodes close to @xmath25 .",
    "while both scenarios guarantee high qst fidelity , the qst time turns out to be dramatically reduced in the presence of a resonance . as we will see later in the paper ,",
    "the external potential can represent a useful tool to move from one regime to the other .",
    "since dealing with a homogeneous spin - spin coupling amplitude is experimentally very desirable , in the following , we will also look for possible strategies compatible with @xmath26 and use the possibility of having a position - dependent external field as a free parameter .",
    "we aim to establish the conditions under which the rabi - like behavior can be observed independently without resorting to the weak coupling assumption . since it is well known that only mirror - symmetric hamiltonians are suitable for qst @xcite , we pick an external potential which fulfills this symmetry condition as well as ensuring that @xmath27 . a simple class of external fields which satisfies this criterion is given by @xmath28 and two special cases",
    "are represented by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the first case describes the common , flat potential , while the second one represents the experimentally relevant case of an external harmonic potential  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution of single - particle states in optical lattices with less than @xmath31 sites , under nearest - neighbor spin - spin hopping and in the presence of a harmonic potential , has recently been experimentally observed by weitenberg _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of a qst transfer protocol is usually estimated by measuring the distance of the real transferred state from the state transferred under optimal conditions using fidelity @xcite . as we are interested in studying qst for a broad class of models , calculating the ordinary fidelity would therefore require a huge amount of numerical calculation .",
    "instead , we suggest following a slightly different approach where instead of focusing on any initial state , we estimate the _ transferring ability _ of the hamiltonian by introducing a ( sufficient ) criterion .    to do this let us consider the set of eigenvectors @xmath32 of the hamiltonian @xmath6 . in the case of ideal transfer ,",
    "two of them will coincide with @xmath33 and @xmath34 and therefore any deviation from the ideal regime can be used as a measure of how much information is lost during the process . to quantify this",
    "we define @xmath35 - 1/\\sqrt{2}$ ] , which we call the _",
    "qst drop_. considering the mirror symmetry of the hamiltonian , @xmath36 implies that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are in fact eigenstates . for small values of @xmath37",
    "the spectral weight is almost completely absorbed by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , while from highly positive or negative values of @xmath37 one can deduce the absence of rabi oscillations due to the dispersive behavior in the chain .",
    "the indicator @xmath40 introduced before to quantify the qst drop is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a function of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , assuming @xmath43 and a chain of @xmath44 sites with @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in any of the figures described in the following , @xmath47 ( together with @xmath48 )",
    "is used as energy and inverse time scale .",
    "whilst the details of fig .  [ fig2 ] will change for different values of @xmath0 , what is clearly captured here is the transition from the weak - coupling regime to uniform coupling .",
    "one can see that for weak external potentials ( small @xmath42 ) , good fidelities ( @xmath40 close to @xmath49 ) can only be achieved using the weak - coupling approach reviewed above and the efficiency drops approximately linear with increasing @xmath41 . for @xmath42",
    "sufficiently strong , however , f is almost constant and optimal , allowing for the weak - coupling assumption to become unnecessary .",
    "this result can be understood by considering that both weak coupling and strong potential offsets lead to an effective decoupling of the extreme sites from the rest of the chain @xcite .",
    "the condition for the decoupling to be effective can be obtained , within a perturbation - theory approach , by assuming that the two eigenvalues close to @xmath50 are only slightly modified by the presence of the channel . in the weak - coupling limit",
    ", the bulk chain ( sites from @xmath51 to @xmath52 ) forms an energy band , that is , the site index is not a good quantum number and eigenstates correspond to nonlocal modes . on the other hand , in the case of very strong potentials ( @xmath53 ) , each pair of degenerate sites",
    "is almost decoupled from all the other pairs and the linear combinations @xmath33 and @xmath34 are spontaneously selected in the dynamical process .",
    "this result can be understood considering that in the limit of very large @xmath42 the hopping term of the hamiltonian only contributes as a perturbation . in the single - site representation , the spectrum",
    "is then composed of @xmath54 pairs of degenerate levels , each of them with an energy @xmath5 . by adding the hopping and using a degenerate perturbation - theory approach",
    ", one finds that the degeneracy within any of the pairs is removed , and the true eigenstates are close to the linear combinations @xmath55 .",
    "then , in this regime , it is in principle possible to obtain qst between any pair of spins symmetrically displaced with respect to the center of the chain . in the limit of @xmath56 ,",
    "the potential induces local barriers , giving rise to a transfer mechanism similar to the one proposed by lorenzo _ et al .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite .    roughly speaking , by assuming @xmath57 , the mode description for the channel fails to give a correct picture when @xmath58 , that is , when the localization effects of the potential start becoming predominant . for the case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , this rough estimation gives a threshold value @xmath59 , which is in very good agreement with the observed result .",
    "then , to summarize , high - fidelity qst is achieved either if @xmath60 , irrespective of @xmath41 , or if @xmath61 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , that is , of the probability to find the excitation respectively in the sender and in the receiver station , without relying on the weak coupling approximation , is depicted in fig .",
    "channel modes contribute to introduce noise in the transmission process , as witnessed by high - frequency oscillations , but the leading two - mode behavior guarantees high - fidelity qst . far from the weak coupling limit , the sharp transition to highly efficient qst in fig .",

    ", width=264 ]    as discussed before , efficient qst in the weak - coupling regime can be obtained either by exploiting the resonance with a single band level or by detuning from all levels comprising the bus .",
    "adding an external potential with adjustable strength or shape can then allow one to drive the system between the first regime and the latter . while the distinction between the two regimes becomes difficult for long chains , where a continuum of states is established",
    ", the differences between on and off - resonance are clearly observable in short chains , for example by monitoring the qst time @xmath14 , which is dramatically shorter in the presence of a resonant level . in fig .",

    "whenever one of the chain eigenvalues approaches the energy levels of the dimer formed by the sender and the receiver , a faster three - body oscillation takes place causing a reduction of @xmath14 .",
    "the number of resonances and their positions therefore depend on the size of the chain . for @xmath42 large enough , the weak - coupling corrections become negligible since the localizing effect of the potential becomes dominant , as discussed before , and @xmath14 increases monotonically .",
    "however , for small values of @xmath42 , approaching a resonance also implies a degradation of the qst quality ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] upper panel , black line ) .",

    "the qst remains very high while @xmath14 decreases .",
    "as the three levels get too close to each other , an asymmetric oscillation with two leading frequencies characterized by different weights takes place , whose interference leads to a decrease of the qst fidelity .",
    "however , a fine tuning of @xmath42 can lead to a substantial reduction of @xmath14 , while keeping the transmission almost perfect .",
    "so far we have described the emergence of localization by tuning @xmath42 , but obviously the potential depth @xmath73 can play a similar role . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we display @xmath40 as a function of @xmath42 and potential depth @xmath73 , by assuming @xmath66 and @xmath44 .",
    "as expected , for small @xmath73 , the external sites can be efficiently isolated from the transmission chain only if @xmath42 is very large , while smaller values of @xmath42 are sufficient for larger @xmath73 .",

    "using these numbers , one obtains @xmath88 , which is very close to the optimal value necessary to obtain a high fidelity in a qst protocol ( see fig .",

    "the field can play a double role . in the weak - coupling limit and for relatively small intensities , it can be used to tune the sender s and the receiver s stations with one of the energy levels of the chain , resulting in a dramatic reduction of the transfer time of the protocol .",
