    "the scuba half degree extragalactic survey ( shades ; @xcite ; @xcite ) mapped @xmath9 of sky with an rms of 2mjy at @xmath1 with the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ; @xcite ) .",
    "the area was split approximately evenly between the lockman hole ( lh ) and the subaru-_xmm _ deep field ( sxdf ) . using uniform selection criteria ,",
    "the survey uncovered 120 smgs with a median deboosted flux density of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the shades programme was designed to study the nature and evolution of high star - formation rate ( sfr ) submillimetre galaxies ( smgs ) via a systematic study of a well - characterised and statistically meaningful sample .",
    "the programme includes an effort to identify members of the source list at other wavelengths using deep follow - up data from the radio @xcite to x - ray , in order to characterise the shades population and to probe the variation in the star - formation and clustering with redshift .",
    "the relatively precise positions available from the radio data greatly aid in identifying secure counterparts at other wavelengths , which can then be used to provide spectroscopic or photometric redshifts @xcite and to categorise the sources .    even combined with knowledge of source redshift , scuba @xmath1 and millimetre wavelength fluxes do not constrain the total dust mass of a galaxy because there is an ambiguity between column density and source temperature .",
    "the submillimetre ( submm ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a luminous dusty galaxy arises from the re - emission at far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths of absorbed optical / uv radiation from regions of intense star - formation ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "typically the dust temperature is within a factor of 2 of @xmath11 @xcite , so the restframe sed peaks in the range 60@xmath12 and the sed is almost a simple power law at the scuba wavelengths and longer .    at a redshift of @xmath13 or 3 , typical of smgs @xcite , the peak of the sed",
    "is shifted to be near @xmath0 , and the submillimetre high angular resolution camera ( sharc - ii ; @xcite ) at the caltech submillimetre observatory ( cso ) is very well situated to provide the photometry needed to constrain the temperatures , and therefore the luminosities and masses , of the shades sources .",
    "we have therefore mapped a subset of the shades catalogue with sharc - ii . in this paper",
    "we constrain the fir seds of our sample by fitting modified blackbody curves to the fir photometry of 31 shades smgs including sharc - ii data at @xmath0 .",
    "sections  [ obs ] and [ dr ] describe the observations and data reduction .",
    "section  [ results ] presents the @xmath0 flux densities of the shades galaxies and the fir seds .",
    "section  [ discussion ] provides a discussion of the results .",
    "conclusions and future prospects are discussed in section  [ fp ] .",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters from the _ wmap _ fits in @xcite : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16kms@xmath17mpc@xmath17 .",
    "sharc - ii is a background - limited 350 and @xmath18 common - user continuum camera with a @xmath19 field of view ( fov ) at the 10.4-metre cso in hawaii @xcite .",
    "the dish has a very low surface error ( @xmath20 rms at @xmath0 ) due to the active dish surface optimization system @xcite which corrects the primary for surface imperfections and gravitational deformations as a function of elevation angle during observations to improve the telescope efficiency and pointing .",
    "the result is that the cso is probably the best telescope in the world at shorter submm wavelengths .",
    "the resulting beam size ( with good focus and pointing ) is 9arcsec fwhm at @xmath0 .",
    "120 submm sources have been identified in the shades fields @xcite .",
    "obtaining useful photometry for the full set would require several hundred hours of excellent weather , so we have chosen to observe a carefully chosen subset of the shades catalogue .",
    "many sources lie close enough together that multiple targets can be selected within a single sharc - ii fov .",
    "we chose eight of our 14 fields to contain a large fraction of the shades close angular pairs .",
    "this is mostly just for efficiency , but there is also a small chance that the observations would help measure clustering in the shades catalogue .",
    "we chose a deliberate mixture of sources with compact , extended , or no radio counterparts @xcite : 11 sources with one robust compact radio i d ; three sources with two robust compact radio counterparts ; three sources with one extended - looking radio counterpart ; and seven sources with no reliable radio i d . choosing targets with this mixture of radio characteristics could help refine the shades redshift distribution and test if there is a sub - population with a high - redshift tail ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "two of our fields were also observed by @xcite or @xcite ( sources lock850.3 , lock850.1 , and lock850.41 ) , which allows for cross - calibration and checks of systematics in observation and analysis .",
    "one field ( lock44/45 ) covered two @xmath1 source candidates from a preliminary shades catalogue which were later eliminated from the official shades catalogue since they were deemed likely to be spurious sources @xcite .",
    "this field is not used in the ensuing analysis .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we identify one serendipitous @xmath21 @xmath0 source in our map of lock26/32 : lock350.1 .",
    "lock350.1 is not associated with any @xmath1 sources , since it is @xmath22 away from any of the shades @xmath1 positions in the map .",
    "based on gaussian noise statistics and the number of independent beam sizes in the survey area with noise less than 20mjy , about 0.1 false positives are expected on average at a s / n of 3.9 ; lock350.1 is therefore likely a real blank - field @xmath0 source .",
    "the position and flux density of lock350.1 are ra=@xmath23 , dec.=@xmath24 ( j2000 ) and @xmath25 .",
    "this position corresponds to a region of positive flux density in the @xmath1 map and a @xmath26 peak is located @xmath27 from the position of lock350.1 .",
    "there also appears to be a @xmath28 1.4ghz source and a faint @xmath29 counterpart at these coordinates ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : lock350.1 ] ) .",
    "this source is therefore probably the third secure @xmath0 blank - field detection ( see @xcite and @xcite for the first two ) .",
    "we now attempt to crudely estimate the @xmath0 source counts at our typical observed flux density , even though the sharc - ii data are not blank - field observations .",
    "we place an upper limit on the source counts using the number of detections acquired in the observed area ; one would expect to do _",
    "worse _ than this in a blank - field survey , since here known smgs were observed . given a total observed area of @xmath30 and seven detections above a @xmath0 flux density of @xmath31mjy",
    ", we estimate @xmath32 .",
    "we estimate a lower limit on the source counts by applying the sharc - ii detection rate of @xmath1 sources to the whole shades area ; one would expect to do at least as well in a blank - field search .",
    "we estimate a lower limit of @xmath33 , given a sharc - ii detection success rate of 7/24 and a total of 120 shades sources found in @xmath34 .",
    "note that we have neglected the possibility of enhanced density from clustering .",
    "the limits derived here are consistent with the predictions from @xcite and scenario e from the semi - analytic models of @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig:350bf ] ) .",
    "although crude , this is the best available estimate of the @xmath0 source counts at these flux densities .",
    "@xcite also report the @xmath0 source counts above 13mjy from a deep survey with sharc - ii .",
    "large surveys planned with the balloon - borne large aperture submm telescope ( blast ; @xcite ) , _ herschel _ @xcite , scuba-2 @xcite , and _ planck _",
    "@xcite will be able to provide further constraints on the source counts at shorter submm wavelengths and over a wider dynamic range of flux densities .",
    "the seds of smgs is dominated by thermal emission from cold dust .",
    "sharc - ii photometry of the shades sources can determine the apparent temperature of the dust .",
    "in conjunction with knowledge of the redshift , this allows inference of dust masses , fir luminosities , and sfrs , allowing one to place these objects in context with other populations of high - redshift star - forming galaxies and agn .",
    "the shape of a luminous dusty galaxy sed is well approximated by a modified blackbody spectrum described by the dust temperature , @xmath35 , and dust emissivity @xmath36 .",
    "where @xmath37 lies in a physically plausible range of 12 @xcite .",
    "there is a degeneracy between @xmath35 and @xmath37 which can not be disentangled by our data @xcite , so we fix @xmath38 , which is consistent with the finding of @xcite for local galaxies and with the values obtained for carbonite and silicate grains from laboratory measurements @xcite .",
    "this leaves two free parameters to be fitted : @xmath35 and the sed normalisation .    in practice",
    "we work in terms of the _ apparent _ dust temperature , @xmath39 and fit the data for each galaxy to @xmath40 $ ] , where several factors of @xmath41 have been absorbed into the _",
    "normalisation , @xmath42 .",
    "assuming that the redshift is known , the restframe dust temperature can be recovered and the luminosity of the smg can be determined by integrating the sed . in cases where the spectroscopic redshift is ambiguous ,",
    "the most reliable or probable spectroscopic redshift available from the literature has been chosen and is listed in table  [ tab : tdm ] . for sources with only a 90 per cent confidence photometric redshift lower limit ,",
    "the redshift is taken at this limit ( see table  [ tab : sharc_photom ] ) .",
    "we characterise the shape of the seds independently of the photometric redshifts because we do not use the radio data in our fits to the sed , and where photometric redshifts are used they have been determined using all available fir and radio photometry ( except for the @xmath0 data from this paper ) .",
    "more complex sed modelling was not attempted ( e.g. ,  fitting two - temperature dust components as in @xcite ) , since this would require more free parameters than can be constrained using the typically 23 photometric points which exist for each of our smgs .",
    "the wien side of the spectrum is sometimes also modified by a power - law of the form @xmath43 to account for the increase in optical depth in this part of the spectrum and to provide a better fit to observational data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we neglect such elaborations here ( see also @xcite ) , since the wien side of the spectrum is not sampled with our data .",
    "@xmath29 photometry are available for shades sources but are complicated to interpret since this band samples pah and stellar emission features in high - redshift star - forming galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the results of this fitting process are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits2 ] .",
    "notice that the @xmath0 data point provides almost all of the contraining power on @xmath44 .",
    "we have measured the apparent temperatures ( @xmath44 ) of an unbiased sample of smgs from shades .",
    "we calculate the corresponding temperature distribution by adding a rectangle of area one centred on the source @xmath44 , with a width given by the errors in @xmath44 to the histogram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tdist ] ) .",
    "it appears that our survey selects smgs with @xmath45k .",
    "we recover the intrinsic dust temperature ( @xmath35 ) distribution of smgs by shifting each sed into the restframe , following a similar procedure to that described for the @xmath44 distribution above ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tdist ] ) .",
    "the @xmath35 distribution appears to contain structure ( ` bumps ' centred around 12k , 28k , and 35k ) and is broader compared with the @xmath44 distribution . to investigate",
    "if this distribution is more structured and/or wider than we would expect by chance , we have simulated the temperature distribution we would expect to see if all smgs have @xmath46k .",
    "the simulated @xmath35 distribution is constructed by adding an error box of area one centred on @xmath47 , where ` rand ' is a normally - distributed random number , for each source .",
    "although the shape and width of the simulated distribution changes notably depending on the random realisation , we _ never _ reproduce the ` bumps ' at @xmath48 or 35k and we _ always _ predict more smgs at a few k than we see . therefore we conclude that the underlying distribution is just a bit wider than we expect by chance and is consistent with most smgs at 28k with a few hotter ones .",
    "now we compare the dust temperatures of our photometric and spectroscopic redshift sub - samples and to previous estimates for smgs .",
    "we derive a mean @xmath49 ( median @xmath50 ) for our sample of smgs with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "for the sample of 21 @xmath0-observed smgs with only photometric redshifts , the mean is @xmath51 ( median @xmath52 ) .",
    "a two - sided ks test reveals that the temperature distributions of the photometric redshift and spectroscopic redshift subsets are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution .",
    "therefore we quote a mean @xmath53 ( median @xmath52 ) for our entire sample of smgs .",
    "our mean @xmath35 is consistent with previous estimates for smgs from @xcite ( @xmath54 for radio - identified smgs spectroscopic redshifts ) , from @xcite ( @xmath55 ) , and from @xcite ( @xmath56 for smgs in the great observatories origins deep survey - north , goods - n , region ) .",
    "in contrast , we find that the @xcite ulirg sample has a median @xmath57 when their photometry are fit with our greybody ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus smgs appear to have lower temperatures on average than local ulirgs , although bear in mind that local ulirgs are selected at @xmath58 which inherently introduces a bias to selecting hotter objects than submm observations would typically find .",
    "the sed is integrated to estimate the bolometric luminosity of the smg .",
    "assuming that the fir luminosity is predominantly powered by star - formation ( i.e.  negligible contribution from an agn ) , coming from a starburst of less than 100myr , with a @xcite initial mass function , then the sfr can be calculated following @xcite :    @xmath59    the median fir luminosity for our sample is @xmath60 ( the mean is @xmath61 , with a large scatter ) , which is consistent with what has been found previously for smgs ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the median sfr for the @xmath0-observed shades sources is @xmath6 , as calculated from equation  [ sfr ] .",
    "this is consistent with previous work , indicating that smgs are significant contributors in the global star - formation of the high - redshift universe ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "thus there appears to be a hint of a dearth of higher luminosity smgs at the lowest redshifts compared to higher redshifts that can not be explained by selection or volume effects .",
    "these results are difficult to make sense of unless a strong smg evolution with redshift is invoked .",
    "millimetre - wave cameras such as mambo , bolocam and aztec might be sensitive to cooler seds and could perhaps select smgs to fill in this region of the ( @xmath216 , @xmath228 ) plane .",

    "this means that they must be evolving very steeply with redshift ( i.e.  ` down - sizing ' ) .",
    "this idea has already been explored in @xcite .",
    "larger samples of smgs with robust redshifts and a wider dynamic range in 350 and @xmath1 flux densities and luminosity are needed to test this idea further and to fully describe the evolution of the luminosity function of smgs .",
    "we have performed follow - up mapping at @xmath0 using sharc - ii of several @xmath1-selected sources from shades . in total",
    "there are flux density measurements for about 25 per cent of the shades smgs , of which this work has provided 21 new flux density constraints .",
    "the combination of 350 and @xmath1 , 1.1 , and/or 1.2 mm photometry and spectroscopic or photometric redshifts have provided estimates of @xmath35 and @xmath216 for each @xmath0-observed shades smg by fitting a modified blackbody function to the data .",
    "the smgs population is confirmed to be dominated by very dusty ( @xmath3 ) , luminous ( @xmath4 ) star - forming ( @xmath236 ) galaxies with dust temperatures of @xmath5 .",
    "we have measured the temperature distribution of smgs and find that the underlying distribution is slightly broader than implied by the error bars , and that most smgs are at 28k with a few hotter .    with the data in hand , it is very difficult to understand whether we are just seeing a combination of selection effects and the known luminosity evolution of smgs , or whether the seds might also systematically change with redshift .",
    "larger samples of smgs with a broader selection function will enable this to be fully investigated , e.g.  with a deep @xmath18 survey , a primary goal of the upcoming scuba-2 cosmological legacy survey .    using these data ,",
    "we have also been able to estimate the @xmath0 source counts at @xmath237 .",
    "large blank - field surveys at 350 and/or @xmath18 will allow us to study a statistically significant population of lower redshift and/or hotter dust temperature galaxies , responsible for emission nearer to the peak of the extragalactic background than those selected at @xmath1 . these studies should provide a link between galaxies detected at @xmath238 and those selected in the mid - ir with _",
    "spitzer_. such comparisons should allow us to investigate the evolution of fir emitting galaxies and how they contribute to the background at different wavelengths .",

    "when describing astronomical data , it is common and straightforward to give total observation times , or perhaps in chopped systems the total time _ on source_. these times give an indication of the amount of effort expended to collect the data .",
    "however , because the atmosphere is far from transparent at submm wavelengths ( even in the atmospheric windows ) and the transmission is so weather dependent , the total exposure time does not give a good indication of data quality or expected noise level in the final output .",
    "it is more useful to refer to the _ effective total exposure _ which is the noise - squared weighted sum of exposure times referred to a completely transparent atmosphere .",
    "the optical depth of the atmosphere in a given direction is determined from the wavelength dependent optical depth at zenith , @xmath239 , and the cosecant of the zenith angle , @xmath240 , of observation , called the airmass , @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the strength of an observed astronomical flux density , @xmath241 is :      at @xmath1 , the zenith optical depth , @xmath243 , ranges from , say , 0.16 in very good weather to 0.7 in bad weather , and the optical depth at 350 or @xmath18 is typically 7 times higher .",
    "the first step in combining data collected at different times of night with different values of @xmath239 and @xmath42 is to correct @xmath241 for atmospheric absorption by multiplying by @xmath244 ( see @xcite ) .    after correcting for atmospheric transients , etc . ,",
    "but not opacity , the _ output _ noise at the detector is fairly independent of atmospheric opacity , at least for scuba operating on the jcmt on mauna kea at 450 and @xmath1 , and for sharc - ii operating at @xmath0 at the cso also on mauna kea .",
    "therefore , the _ effective _ noise of an observation is inflated exponentially in @xmath239 and @xmath42 .",
    "the sum      is the integration time that would be required with a completely transparent atmosphere to get the same noise level as a given noise - squared weighted sum of observations , each of size @xmath246 .",
    "we call this the _ effective exposure time _ and find that tracking this quantity during observations is an effective way to monitor experimental progress .    in practice ,",
    "the optical depth as a function of time is obtained from automated measurements made at the cso at @xmath247 every 10 minutes .",
    "the optical depths at submm wavelengths are very well correlated with these values and one multiplies @xmath248 by about 4 and by 24 to get optical depths for scuba at 850 and @xmath18 , respectively , and by 26 to get @xmath249 for sharc - ii at @xmath0 @xcite .    as a numerical example ,",
    "observation of a source which rises through transit with an average airmass of 1.3 and @xmath250 for 4 hours results in effective exposure times of 2.4 hours at @xmath1 , 20.7 _ minutes _ at @xmath18 with scuba , and 9.5 minutes with sharc - ii .",
    "the shorter effective times at shorter wavelengths are a consequence of the fact that the atmosphere is not very transparent at those wavelengths .",
    "this is why space experiments like _ herschel_-spire and _ blast _ are useful even with comparatively small apertures , and why neither of those experiments carries an @xmath1 channel .",
    "experience has shown that effective exposures of between 500 and 600 seconds with sharc - ii are often sufficient to detect faint extragalactic high - redshift sources ."
