    "we now consider the transition from the electron - atom to the positron - atom bremsstrahlung in more detail .",

    "@xcite , with radial integrals evaluted numerically and the integration contour rotated to the imaginary axis .",
    "we performed calculations for two types of the target , ( i ) the bare nucleus and ( ii ) the neutral atom . in the latter case , the electronic structure of the atom was represented by a static screening potential obtained by the dirac - fock method .",
    "the negative - energy continuum - state dirac wave functions @xmath49 for the point coulomb potential can be calculated by using their analytic representation in terms of the whittaker @xmath50 function @xcite , similarly to that for the positive energies . for the neutral atoms , however , the wave functions have to be computed numerically . in this case",
    ", it is convenient to transform the negative - energy states to the positive - energy ones by using the symmetry of the radial dirac equation .",
    "one can show that the upper and lower radial components of the negative - energy dirac solution with the potential @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , can be expressed in terms of the components of the positive - energy solutions with the potential @xmath54 as @xmath55 this approach to the evaluation of the negative - energy dirac states was previously used in ref .",
    "we begin with calculating the single - differential cross section of the electron and positron - atom bremsstrahlung .",
    "the results can be conveniently represented in terms of the scaled cross section @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the nuclear charge and @xmath58 is the photon energy .",
    "this part of our calculations can be compared with the previous work by feng , pratt , and tseng @xcite .",
    "very good agreement with their calculation was found .",
    "so , for the inital kinetic energy @xmath59  kev , the fractional energy carried by the photon @xmath60 , and the bare - nucleus target , we obtain the ratio of the positron - to - electron bremsstrahlung cross sections @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 , whereas ref .",

    "our numerical results for the cross sections of the positron and electron bremsstrahlung are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] for two targets , carbon and gold , and the initial projectile energy of 100  kev .",
    "carbon is an essentially nonrelativistic system . in this case , the positron bremsstrahlung is only slightly suppressed as compared to the electron one and the difference between the bare nucleus and neutral atom is very small ( i.e. , the screening effect of the atomic electrons is nearly negligible ) . for gold , on the contrary , the relativistic binding effects are large . within the classical - physics picture , one can expect that the strong coulomb potential of the nucleus significantly changes the projectile velocity at the point of the closest approach ( where the photon emission is most probable ) and thus breaks the symmetry between the electron and the positron spectra .",
    "indeed , our calculations for gold show a large suppression of the positron bremsstrahlung in the region @xmath67 and also a significant screening effect of the target electrons .",
    "we observe that the screening effect reduces the cross section for the case of the electron bremsstrahlung but enhances it for the positron bremsstrahlung .",
    "remarkably , in the region @xmath68 , the screening effect enhances the positron bremsstrahlung by an order of magnitude as compared to the pure coulomb field ( as noted already in ref .",
    "but , as the resulting cross section is still very small , the effect is difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "the numerical results for the double - differential cross section , @xmath69 , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff ] .",
    "the calculation was performed for neutral atomic targets ( carbon and gold ) and several energies of the incoming projectile .",
    "we observe that the dominant difference between the electron @xmath70 and positron @xmath71 cross sections comes from the suppression of the positron bremsstrahlung .",
    "as can be seen from the picture , the suppression grows with increasing the nuclear charge and decreasing the energy of the initial projectile .",
    "this is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , which concludes that , for a large range of the kinetic energy of the incoming projectile @xmath72 , the overall suppression factor is a nearly linear function of @xmath73 .",
    "next , we compare the polarization properties of the electron and positron bremsstrahlung .",
    "the most important polarization property is the stokes parameter of the emitted photon @xmath74 for the initially unpolarized projectile .",
    "( in this case , @xmath74 yields also the degree of the linear polarization of the emitted radiation . ) the numerical results for @xmath74 are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : p1 ] and [ fig : p1 _ ] .",
    "since the screening effect of atomic electrons on the stokes parameters is rather weak , the results shown were obtained for the bare nucleus targets .",
    "we again observe that for the light targets ( carbon ) , the polarization of the positron bremsstrahlung is almost identical to the electron one . for the gold target , however , the relativistic effects break the electron - positron symmetry of the bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "the difference between the electron and positron bremsstrahlung spectra becomes increasingly more pronounced when the initial projectile energy is enlarged .",
    "the second polarization correlation that is of the experimental interest today is the stokes parameter of the emitted photon @xmath75 .",
    "it manifests itself as a rotation of the polarization ellipse of the emitted radiation in the plane perpendicular to the photon momentum .",
    "the ratio of @xmath75 and @xmath74 yields the tilt angle @xmath76 of the polarization ellipse ( @xmath77 ) , which can nowadays be measured very precisely @xcite . our numerical results for the stokes parameter @xmath75 for the initially _ longitudinally _",
    "polarized projectile are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : p2 ] . since @xmath75 is purely a relativistic effect , its typical numerical values are very small for low-@xmath57 target but grow rapidly when the initial projectile energy and the nuclear charge are increased .",
    "an important observation is that the numerical values of @xmath75 for the initially longitudinally polarized electrons and positrons are of the opposite sign .",
    "this could have been anticipated from the fact that @xmath75 scales linearly with @xmath57 @xcite and , therefore , changes its sign after the substitution @xmath78 .",
    "the consequence of the opposite sign of @xmath79 and @xmath80 is that the rotation of the polarization ellipse of the emitted radiation for the longitudinally polarized electron and positron beams will occur in the opposite directions .    beside this effect , we observe that @xmath81 and @xmath82 nearly coincide for light targets but become increasingly different as the nuclear charge and the initial projectile energy are enlarged .",
    "we also note that the difference between the stokes parameters is generally smaller at the forward angles and larger at the backward angles .",
    "this effect can be understood from simple classical - physics arguments . in order to scatter backwards off the positively - charge nucleus , the electron has to go all the way around the nucleus , whereas the positron just enters the nuclear field and bounces back .",
    "so , for the back scattering , the paths within the region of the strong field ( and , therefore , the accumulated relativistic effects ) are very different for the electron and the positron . for the forward scattering , however ,",
    "mainly the straight trajectories contribute and so the paths of the electron and the positron in the strong coulomb field are almost the same .    in summary , we perfomed a calculation of the electron - atom and positron - atom bremsstrahlung within the rigorous relativistic approach based on the partial - wave expansion of the dirac wave functions in the external atomic field .",
    "comparison between the electron and positron bremsstrahlung spectra is made for the single and double differential cross sections and the stokes parameters of the emitted radiation .",
    "it is demonstrated that for the low-@xmath57 targets , the polarization of the electron and positron bremsstrahlung radiation is very much similar ( except for the polarization correlations vanishing in the nonrelativistic limit ) .",
    "however , for heavy relativistic targets and high impact energies , the positron bremsstrahlung becomes significantly suppressed and distorted as compared to the electron bremsstrahlung .",
