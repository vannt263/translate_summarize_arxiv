    "since the original work by fisher and de gennes @xcite , it has been well accepted that in the vicinity of a critical point the developing long range fluctuations give rise to a casimir force in a system with a film - like geometry . as a consequence of finite size scaling @xcite",
    ", the generic form of the force is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the critical temperature , @xmath2 is the thickness of the film , @xmath3 is the bulk dimensionality of the system , @xmath4 is the correlation length which diverges at the critical point in the bulk , and @xmath5 is a universal function of its one argument .",
    "the notion of universality requires some qualification in the context of casimir forces .",
    "generally , for a system with a critical point , universality implies dependence only on the universality class to which that system belongs . in the case of an ising model ,",
    "that universality class is characterized as @xmath6 , corresponding to the discrete symmetry that is broken in the ordered phase .",
    "systems belonging to this class include uniaxial ferromagnets , simple liquid - vapor systems and systems exhibiting de - mixing @xcite .",
    "the universality class , however , is not the only characteristic of the system that dictates the behavior of the function @xmath7 ; one must also consider the boundary conditions at the two extremities of the film .",
    "this effect is dramatically exhibited in the results of measurements performed in ref .",
    "those experiments monitor the thickness of a film of @xmath8he as the temperature passes through the lambda point at which bulk helium acquires superfluid characteristics .",
    "it was found that the thickness of the film , which directly tracks the casimir force appearing in the vicinity of this critical point , changes substantially when the temperature is close to and slightly below @xmath9 . quite interestingly , deep in the superfluid phase",
    ", the film partially recovers its thickness but still remains thinner than in the normal phase .",
    "the thinning of the film well below the transition point was successfully explained in ref @xcite , where it is shown that the confinement of bulk goldstone modes combined with the effect of finite film thickness on surface fluctuations gives rise to a casimir force that reduces the thickness of the film in the superfluid phase as compared to that of the normal film .",
    "however , the much more substantial thinning of the film right below the critical point remained unexplained for many years .",
    "earlier predictions of the casimir force at the vicinity of @xmath10 transition based on calculations emphasizing the correct universality class , @xmath11 for the superfluid transition in @xmath8he @xcite , differ markedly from the experimentally determined force , which is greater in magnitude by a factor of about thirty than those theoretical results .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the discrepancy arises from the boundary conditions assumed in the previous calculations .",
    "in particular , prior field theoretical calculations @xcite as well as the simulations in @xcite assume periodic boundary conditions , while physical reality requires the superfluid order parameter to vanish immediately outside of the helium film , thus mandating dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the boundary conditions operative in a system play an important role in determining the behavior of casimir forces @xcite . however , there is no _ a priori _ reason to assume that the strength of casimir force with dirichlet boundary conditions will be significantly larger than that for the case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in fact , the absence of this expectation undoubtedly hindered our understanding of the dip in helium films for many years .",
    "the strong effect of boundary conditions on the casimir force in the particular instance of an @xmath11 system in three dimensions leads one to ask if there are any general inferences one can arrive at regarding the interplay of boundary conditions , dimensionality , and universality class on the casimir force acting on a system at and near the critical point . with an eye toward developing a greater depth of understanding of effects of boundary conditions and dimensionality , we have looked closely at one system for which exact results can be obtained : an ising model in one and two dimensions . with regard to the one - dimensional ising model relevant results",
    "follow almost immediately from a simple transfer matrix analysis . in the case of the two dimensional ising model , we have been able to perform an analysis of that model that yields the critical casimir force for four different boundary conditions : periodic , antiperiodic , free ( the appropriate surrogate for dirichlet boundary conditions in the ising model ) and fixed - spin .",
    "the results of this analysis are consistent with those we have extracted from various expressions already in the literature .",
    "a key conclusion that we draw is that boundary conditions alone do not determine the relative amplitudes of critical casimir forces .",
    "indeed , we find that as dimensionality is reduced , periodic ( and antiperiodic ) boundary conditions give rise to a critical casimir force that is increasingly stronger than the force resulting from free boundary conditions .",
    "in fact , the critical casimir force for a one dimensional ising model with free boundary conditions is effectively non - existent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ onedimension ]",
    "we calculate the casimir force for the one - dimensional ising model as a prelude to the discussion of the two dimensional version .",
    "we obtain the casimir forces with free , fixed , periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we observe significant differences in the forces in these four cases . in section [ twodimension ]",
    ", we present our results for the two dimensional ising model and compare them with the one dimensional results .",
    "the forces are derived in two different ways .",
    "first , we show how they follow from expressions already in the literature .",
    "we also demonstrate how they arise from an unified analysis of the two dimensional ising model making use of an approach along the lines of the method developed by schultz , mattis and lieb @xcite . in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we discuss our findings , their implications , and summarize our conclusions . for clarity of exposition , details of our calculations are relegated to appendices .",
    "the partition function of the one dimensional ising model is well known to be derivable from the two - by - two transfer matrix of that model .",
    "the ising model possesses a global @xmath12 symmetry and is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spin - spin coupling constant , and the sum is over nearest neighbor bonds @xmath15 on the lattice .",

    "that is , for the one - dimensional ising model @xmath34    note that the factor @xmath35 plays an essential role in our result for the casimir force .",
    "to the extent that it can be said to exist , the critical point of the one - dimensional ising model is at @xmath36 .",
    "unless we normalize the critical casimir force in terms of this temperature - dependent factor , we are forced to conclude that it vanishes .",
    "the second boundary condition we study here is antiperiodic .",
    "we enforce this boundary condition by introducing an array of antiferromagnetic bonds in the system . in this case",
    ", there are @xmath37 two - by - two transfer matrices of the form ( [ eq : t1 ] ) and one transfer matrix of the form @xmath38 the eigenvector decomposition of the transfer matrix @xmath39 is @xmath40    the partition function of this system is the trace of the quantity @xmath41 . making use of ( [ eq : eveneig ] ) and ( [ eq : oddeig ] ) , we have @xmath42 this means that the free energy is given by @xmath43 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & n f_b -k_bt \\ln \\left [ 1-e^{-n/ \\xi}\\right ] \\label{eq : freeap1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath44 in the last line of ( [ eq : freeap1 ] ) is the `` bulk '' free energy of the one - dimensional ising model .",
    "the quantity @xmath45 is the correlation length of that model .",
    "we then take the negative derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath2 , add in @xmath44 , and end up with @xmath46 fiture [ fig : apgplot ] displays universal functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    , shown as a dashed curve and the function @xmath48 , shown as a solid curve .",
    ", width=288 ]    two distinct features of this scaling function distinguish it from the case of periodic boundary conditions ; it is positive , indicating a repulsive casimir force , and it does not go to zero at the zero temperature critical point .      in the case of free boundary conditions ,",
    "the partition function of the @xmath20-layer system is given by @xmath49 taking the derivative with respect to @xmath20 of the log of the above result and subtracting the bulk contribution to that derivative , we find perfect cancellation .",
    "there is no residual force .    when the spins are fixed at the boundary , the state between which the @xmath50 power of the transfer matrix is sandwiched is @xmath51 and the partition function is given by @xmath52 given the near identity between the final line of ( [ eq : fixed2 ] ) and what was obtained for the partition function of the system with periodic boundary conditions in ( [ eq : part1 ] ) , we find immediately that the critical casimir force induced by fixed boundary conditions matches the corresponding force in the case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in this section , we consider an ising model on a two dimensional square lattice consisting of @xmath53 rows and @xmath20 columns .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is the same as given in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) but the sum is over a two dimensional lattice",
    ". we will begin by focusing on periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions , first demonstrating how the critical casimir force follows from expressions for the partition function already in the literature .",
    "then , we perform an analysis of the two dimensional ising model based on the fermion variable approach introduced by schultz , mattis and lieb that leads to precisely the same results . finally , we make use of this same approach to rederive existing expressions for the critical casimir force in the case of free and fixed boundary conditions . as has already been noted , the casimir forces in the two dimensional ising model for free and fixed - spin boundary conditions are connected by a duality relationship .",

    "this means that the partition function in question reduces to @xmath61 + \\nonumber \\\\ 2 \\exp \\left[\\frac{n}{2 \\pi } \\int_0^{2 \\pi } \\ln \\cosh \\left(\\frac{m}{2 } \\gamma(e^{i \\phi } ) \\right ) d \\phi \\right ] \\label{eq : cpart1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be rewritten as follows :    @xmath62 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left(1 + \\exp \\left[\\frac{n}{2 \\pi } \\left(\\int_0^{2 \\pi } \\ln \\sinh \\left(\\frac{m}{2 } \\gamma(e^{i \\phi } ) \\right ) d \\phi- \\int_0^{2 \\pi } \\ln \\cosh \\left(\\frac{m}{2 } \\gamma(e^{i \\phi } ) \\right ) d \\phi\\right ) \\right]\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 \\exp \\left[\\frac{n}{2 \\pi } \\int_0^{2 \\pi } \\ln \\cosh \\left(\\frac{m}{2 } \\gamma(e^{i \\phi } ) \\right ) d \\phi \\right ]    \\left\\{1 +   \\exp \\left[\\frac{n}{2 \\pi } \\int_0^{2 \\pi } \\ln \\tanh \\left(\\frac{m}{2 } \\gamma(e^{i \\phi } ) \\right ) d \\phi   \\right]\\right\\ } \\label{eq : ans1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    because @xmath63 for any positive @xmath64 , the function @xmath65 will be negative .",
