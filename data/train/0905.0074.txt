    "3b ( @xmath26 measurement ) . based on this fact",
    ", we can assume that the input horizontal / vertical polarization is preserved in our filter , and thus our filter operation can be well described in terms of superpositions of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . under this assumption",

    "it is convenient to express the errors in terms of the superpositions @xmath31 here , @xmath32 represents the intended operation of the entanglement filter , @xmath33 represents the operation with a phase flip error between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 represent the leakage ( or transmission error ) of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 components , either with or without a phase flip between these components .",

    "<S> the ability to filter quantum states is a key capability in quantum information science and technology , where one - qubit filters , or polarizers , have found wide application . </S>",
    "<S> filtering on the basis of entanglement requires extension to multi - qubit filters with qubit - qubit interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate an optical entanglement filter that passes a pair of photons if they have the desired correlations of their polarization . </S>",
    "<S> such devices have many important applications to quantum technologies .    </S>",
    "<S> filters , that pass the desired and reject the unwanted ( material , signal , frequency , polarization , etc ) are one of the most important scientific and technological tools available to us . </S>",
    "<S> quantum information science and technology is concerned with harnessing quantum mechanical effects to gain exponential improvement and new functionality for particular tasks in communication @xcite , computation @xcite , measurement @xcite , and lithography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most unique of these quantum mechanical features is entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> filters which act on the quantum correlations associated with entanglement must operate non - locally on multiple quantum systems , typically two - level qubits . </S>",
    "<S> such a device has been proposed for photonic qubits @xcite , however , the technical requirements to build such a device , an optical circuit with two ancillary photons and multiple quantum gates , requiring both quantum interference and classical interference in several nested interferomters , have been lacking .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate an entanglement filter by combining two key recent technological approaches  a displaced - sagnac architecture @xcite and partially polarizing beam splitters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the entangling capability of the filter was verified , distinguishing it from classical ones . as our entanglement filter acts on photonic qubits , it is promising for quantum technologies , as photons are the logical choice for communication @xcite , metrology @xcite and lithography @xcite , and are a leading approach to information processing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the filter can be used for the creation as well as the purification of entanglement @xcite , which will be important in realizing quantum relays and repeaters for long distance quantum communication .    </S>",
    "<S> the most common examples of a filter for photonic qubits is a polarizer that transmits only the horizontal component of the incident photons ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> polarization filters are crucial for the initialization and read out of photonic qubits as well as for the measurement related effects such as the quantum zeno effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more sophisticated photonic filters that transmit only single photon states while rejecting higher photon number states have also been realized by using ancillary photons and photon detection to induce the required optical non - linearity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of a polarization filter can be extended to a higher dimensional hilbert space of multi - qubits and one may anticipate that the necessary qubit - qubit interactions required will also require the use of ancillary photons .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - photon polarization filter proposed in @xcite is a device that transmits photon pairs only if they share the same horizontal or vertical polarization without decreasing the quantum coherence between these two possibilities ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> as this filter is not sensitive to the individual polarization of the photons , it can preserve and even create entanglement between the photons passed through it ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the filter achieves this two qubit filtering effect by using two ancilla photons as probes that detect whether the two input photons are in the desired states or not . </S>",
    "<S> detection of the ancilla photons indicates a successful filter operation , requiring no post - selection in the output . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is a significant difference between this filter and the function realized by output post - selection on a polarizing beam splitter @xcite , where it is necessary to eliminate the cases where both photons exit on the same side . </S>",
    "<S> because our filter should reliably produce the correct two photon output in separate ports of the device , it can be integrated into larger quantum information networks , just like a one - qubit polarization filter . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore possible to apply it to a wide range of problems , such as encoding quantum information in multiple - qubits and entanglement purification from mixed entangled states .    </S>",
    "<S> the operation of this filter can be summarized by a single operator @xmath0 describing the effect on an arbitrary two photon input state @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denotes the state where both incident photons are horizontally ( @xmath4 ) and vertically ( @xmath5 ) polarized , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this operator filters out the @xmath6 and @xmath7 components of the two photon state without reducing the coherence between the remaining @xmath2 and@xmath3 components . </S>",
    "<S> the negative sign between the terms is a consequence of the phase difference between two photon reflection and two photon transmission at the beam splitters . </S>",
    "<S> the factor of 1/4 is an expression of the transmission probability of 1/16 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted however that the detection of the ancilla photons indicates a successful transmission of the two input photons , so that it is not necessary to detect the output photons in order to know that they were successfully transmitted .    to understand the unique quantum properties of this filter , </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to consider the effects of the filtering process on two diagonally polarized photons . </S>",
    "<S> as diagonal polarizations are coherent superpositions of horizontal and vertical polarizations ( @xmath8 ; @xmath9 ) , two diagonally polarized photons have a well defined coherence between their @xmath2 and @xmath3 components that determines whether their diagonal polarizations are parallel ( @xmath10 ) [ _ eg _ : @xmath11 or orthogonal ( @xmath12 ) [ _ eg _ : @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath0 preserves the magnitude of this coherence , but flips the sign : eq . </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the correlation between the diagonal polarizations is inverted ; parallel inputs resulting in the superpositions of the orthogonal outputs and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the coherence between @xmath2 and @xmath3 indicates a correlation between the circular polarizations  opposite directions ( @xmath10 ) or same direction ( @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , filtering out the @xmath6 and @xmath7 components of two diagonally polarized input photons also generates correlations between the circular polarizations of the photons , indicating the generation of entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> a schematic of the optical quantum circuit for the entanglement filter fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a shows that multi photon interferences occur at each of the four beam splitters bs1 to bs4 . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial ones are bs2 and bs3 . </S>",
    "<S> the working principle of the quantum circuit is as follows : whenever one of the ancilla photons meets a single input photon at bs2 or bs3 , two photon quantum interference between the reflection of both photons and the exchange of ancilla and input photon reduces the probability of finding a single photon at d1 or d2 to zero ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a , inset ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a single horizontally polarized photon can not pass the circuit , resulting in the elimination of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 components . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath2 component can pass because the two input photons will both arrive at bs2 or bs3 together ( the two h photons undergo quantum interference at bs1 ) . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , the negative probability amplitude corresponding to the exchange of the ancilla photon and one of the input photons is higher than the positive probability amplitude for three photon reflection , and the @xmath2 component is transmitted with a flipped phase .    to realize the quantum optical circuit of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a , we have combined two recent technological approaches in order to simplify and stabilize quantum optical circuits : the displaced - sagnac architecture @xcite and partially polarizing beam splitters ( ppbss ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ppbss reflect vertically polarized photons perfectly while transmitting / reflecting horizontally polarized photons with 50% probability . replacing all the beam splitters ( bs1 to bs4 ) with such ppbss , </S>",
    "<S> we can remove the four polarizing beamsplitters used to separate the two polarizations ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining optical path interferometer is realized as a displaced sagnac interferometer ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c ) . in this setup </S>",
    "<S> , all the four polarization modes of two input photons pass through all the optical components inside the interferometer so that the path - differences between those four polarization modes are robust against drifts or vibrations of optical components .    </S>",
    "<S> we used photons generated via type - i spontaneous parametric down - conversion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pump laser pulses ( 82 mhz , @ 390 nm ) pass through a beta - barium borate ( bbo ) crystal twice to generate two pairs of photons . </S>",
    "<S> two photons in one of the pairs are used as the signal photons , and the two photons in the other pair are used as the ancillary photons . </S>",
    "<S> the visibility of the hong - ou - mandel dip @xcite was @xmath14 for two photons in the same pair , and @xmath15 for photons from different pairs . to test the performance of our quantum filter circuit , we used coincidence measurements between the four threshold detectors at d1 , d2 and the two outputs , rather than using photon number discriminating detectors @xcite for d1 and d2 , as we needed to analyze the polarization state of the output to confirm correct operation . </S>",
    "<S> this polarization analysis was performed using pairs of half wave plates and quarter wave plates together with polarizing beam splitters .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we checked the essential operation of the filter circuit : we prepared input signal photons in the four combinations of horizontal ( h ) and vertical ( v ) polarizations ( which we call the z - basis states ) and observed how those input states are filtered by the circuit ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from the experimental data that the photon pairs are transmitted through the filter when the two input photons share the same polarization ( hh or vv ) , and most of the pairs are filtered out when the two input photons have different polarization ( hv or vh ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity of this process can be defined as the ratio of correctly transmitted photon pairs to the total number of transmitted photon pairs . for the filter s operation on horizontal and vertical polarizations , </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity is @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , it is necessary to test the preservation of quantum coherence between the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 components transmitted by the filter . </S>",
    "<S> as explained above , this can be done by using diagonally polarized photons in the input . </S>",
    "<S> we prepared pairs of photons in all combinations of diagonal linear polarizations @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( the x - basis states ) as signal inputs . </S>",
    "<S> the input photons are then in an equal superposition of the four different horizontal / vertical polarization states @xmath2 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath3 ( with different signs of the coherences for each of the four different inputs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the filter should transmit only the hh and the vv components while preserving the quantum coherence between them . as a result , the ideal output states are entangled states with maximal correlations in both the circular and the diagonal polarizations . to test this entanglement generation , we first detected the output photons in the right - circular @xmath19 and left - circular @xmath20 polarizations ( y - basis ) . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted correlations between the circular polarizations of the output are observed with a fidelity of @xmath21 . to complete the test of entanglement generation </S>",
    "<S> , we also detected the diagonal polarizations of the output to test whether the polarization correlation is correctly flipped by the filter . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity of this filter operation is @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> taken together , the three experimental tests are sufficient for the evaluation of the quantum filter operation . because almost all the errors conserve horizontal / vertical polarization ( see appendix 1 ) , the probability of the correct operation @xmath0 is given by the process fidelity @xmath23 the entanglement capability of the filter </S>",
    "<S> can be evaluated as @xmath24 , and so our experimental results provide clear evidence of the entangling capability of the quantum filter operation .    </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement filter will be a key element in the control of multi - photon quantum states , with a wide range of applications in entanglement based quantum communication and quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> for the present tests of the performance of the quantum filter circuit , we used threshold detectors to monitor the output state . for applications where the output state can not be monitored , </S>",
    "<S> high - efficiency number - resolving photon detectors @xcite could be used at d1 and d2 to generate the heralding signals . </S>",
    "<S> such a circuit could be used for on - demand generation of entangled photons , non - destructive entanglement purification , and could be implemented using an integrated waveguide architecture @xcite . </S>",
