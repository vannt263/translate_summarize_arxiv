    "nonlinear stochastic dynamics of physical , chemical , biological and economical systems has been extensively studied ( for a recent review , see ref .",

    "gaussian white noise is employed as random driving force because of its mathematical simplicity .",
    "the white - noise approximation is appropriate to systems in which the time scale characterizing the relaxation of the noise is much shorter than the characteristic time scale of the system .",
    "there has been a growing interest in theoretical study of nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to colored noise with the finite correlation time ( for a review on colored noise , see ref .",

    "it has been realized that colored noise gives rise to new intriguing effects such as the reentrant phenomenon in a noise - induced transition @xcite and a resonant activation in bistable systems @xcite .    the original model for a system driven by colored noise is expressed by non - markovian stochastic differential equation .",

    "it is difficult to analytically solve the langevin model subjected to _ colored _ noise . for its analytical study ,",
    "two approaches have been adopted : ( 1 ) to construct the multi - dimensional fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the multivariate probability distribution , and ( 2 ) to derive the effective one - dimensional fpe equation .",
    "the presence of multi - variables in the approach ( 1 ) makes a calculation of even the stationary distribution much difficult . in a recent study on the langevin model subjected to additive ( non - gaussian ) colored noise @xcite , we employed the approach ( 1 ) , analyzing the multivariate fpe with the use of the second - order moment method .",
    "a typical example of the approach ( 2 ) is the universal colored noise approximation ( ucna ) @xcite , which interpolates between the limits of zero and infinite relaxation times , and which has been widely adopted for a study of colored noise @xcite .",
    "another example of the approach ( 2 ) is the path - integral and functional - integral methods @xcite-@xcite obtaining the effective fpe , with which stationary properties such as the non - gaussian stationary distribution have been studied @xcite .",
    "theoretical study on the langevin model driven by colored noise has been mostly made for its stationary properties such as the stationary probability distribution and the phase diagram of noise - induced transition @xcite .",
    "as far as we are aware of , little theoretical study has been reported on dynamical properties such as the response to time - dependent inputs .",
    "refs . @xcite",
    "have discussed the filtering effect , in which the high - frequency response of the system is shown to be improved by colored noise .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend the functional - integral method ( fim ) such that we may discuss dynamical properties of the langevin model subjected to colored noise .",
    "we consider , in this paper , two sets of colored noise : ( a ) one additive and one multiplicative colored noise , and ( b ) one additive and two multiplicative colored noise .",
