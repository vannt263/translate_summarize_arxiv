    "inspiraling neutron star binaries are expected to be among the strongest sources of gravitational radiation that could be detected by the interferometric detectors currently under construction ( geo600 , ligo , and virgo ) or in operation ( tama300 ) .",
    "such binary systems are therefore subject to numerous theoretical studies ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . among them",
    "there are ( i ) post - newtonian ( pn ) analytical treatments ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and ( ii ) fully relativistic hydrodynamical treatments , pioneered by the works of oohara & nakamura ( see e.g. @xcite ) , wilson et al . @xcite and recently developed by shibata @xcite , the neutron star grand challenge group @xcite and oohara & nakamura @xcite .",
    "these last three groups integrate forward in time the evolution equations resulting from the 3 + 1 formulation of general relativity @xcite . in parallel of these dynamical calculations ,",
    "some quasiequilibrium formulation of the problem has been developed @xcite and successfully implemented @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption underlying the quasiequilibrium calculations is that the timescale of the orbit shrinking is larger than that of the orbital revolution in the pre - coalescing state .",
    "consequently the evolution of the binary system can be approximated by a succession of exactly circular orbits , hence the name _",
    "quasiequilibrium_. the study of these quasiequilibrium configurations is justified in the view that the fully dynamical computations mentioned above are only in their infancy . in particular , they can not follow more than a few orbits . also they involve a rather coarse resolution of the stars , being performed in a single box with cartesian coordinates .",
    "another motivation for computing quasiequilibrium configurations is to provide valuable initial conditions for the dynamical evolutions @xcite .",
    "the first quasiequilibrium configurations of binary neutron stars in general relativity have been obtained three years ago by baumgarte et al .",
    "@xcite , followed by marronetti et al .",
    ". however these computations considered synchronized binaries .",
    "this rotation state does not correspond to physical situations , since it has been shown that the gravitational - radiation driven evolution is too rapid for the viscous forces to synchronize the spin of each neutron star with the orbit @xcite as they do for ordinary stellar binaries .",
    "rather , the viscosity is negligible and the fluid velocity circulation ( with respect to some inertial frame ) is conserved in these systems .",
    "provided that the initial spins are not in the millisecond regime , this means that close binary configurations are well approximated by zero vorticity ( i.e. _ irrotational _ ) states .",
    "irrotational configurations are more complicated to obtain because the fluid velocity does not vanish in the co - orbiting frame ( as it does for synchronized binaries ) .",
    "we have successfully developed a numerical method to tackle this problem and presented the first quasiequilibrium configurations of irrotational binary neutron stars elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the numerical technique relies on a multi - domain spectral method @xcite within spherical coordinates .",
    "since then , two other groups have obtained relativistic irrotational configurations : ( i ) marronetti , mathews & wilson @xcite by means of single - domain finite difference method within cartesian coordinates and ( ii ) uryu , eriguchi and shibata @xcite by means of multi - domain finite difference method within spherical coordinates .",
    "the present article is devoted to the detailed presentation of our method , along with numerous tests of the numerical code , while the previous letter @xcite gave only a sketch of the equations and some results about an evolutionary sequence built on a polytropic equation of state .",
    "in particular , that letter focuses on the evolution of the central density along the sequence in order to investigate the stability of each star against gravitational collapse .",
    "that study was motivated by the 1995 finding of wilson et al .",
    "@xcite that the neutron stars may individually collapse into a black hole prior to merger",
    ". this unexpected result has been called into question by a number of authors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary of all the criticisms and some answers ) .",
    "recently flanagan @xcite has found an error in the analytical formulation used by wilson et al .",
    "new numerical computations by mathews and wilson @xcite , using a corrected code , show a significantly reduced compression effect .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows .",
    "we start by presenting the equations governing binary stars in general relativity in sect .",
    "[ s : rel_eq ] ( hydrodynamics ) and sect .",
    "[ s : grav ] ( gravitational field ) .",
    "the numerical method developed to integrate these equations is presented in sect .",
    "[ s : num ] .",
    "section  [ s : tests ] is then devoted to the tests passed by the numerical code .",
    "astrophysical results are then presented in sect .",
    "[ s : results ] for an evolutionary sequence of irrotational binary stars constructed on polytropic equation of state of adiabatic index @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ s : discus ] contains the final discussion ( comparison of our method with that used by other groups , conclusions about the tests ) and future prospects .    throughout the present article , we use units of @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the gravitational constant and speed of light .",
    "our treatment of binary neutron stars relies on the assumptions of ( i ) quasiequilibrium state ( i.e. steady state in the co - orbiting frame ) , ( ii ) a specific velocity state for the fluid : either rigid or irrotational flow , ( iii ) the spatial 3-metric is almost conformally flat . in this section ,",
    "we examine the assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) , without invoking assumption ( iii ) , which will be introduced only in sect .",
    "[ s : grav ] .      in the late inspiral phase , before any orbital instability or merging of the two stars , the evolution of binary neutron stars can be approximated by a succession of circular orbits .",
    "indeed when the separation between the centers of the two neutron stars is about @xmath4 ( in harmonic coordinates ) the time variation of the orbital period , @xmath5 , computed at the 2nd post - newtonian ( pn ) order by means of the formulas established by blanchet et al .",
    "@xcite is about @xmath6 .",
    "the evolution at this stage can thus be still considered as a sequence of equilibrium configurations .",
    "moreover the orbits are expected to be circular ( vanishing eccentricity ) , as a consequence of the gravitational radiation reaction @xcite . in terms of the spacetime geometry , we translate these assumptions by demanding that there exists a killing vector field @xmath7 which is expressible as @xcite [ e : helicoidal ] = +  , where @xmath8 is a constant , to be identified with the orbital angular velocity with respect to a distant inertial observer , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two vector fields with the following properties : @xmath9 is timelike at least far from the binary and is normalized so that far from the star it coincides with the 4-velocity of inertial observers with respect to which the total adm 3-momentum of the system vanishes . on the other hand",

    "rotation axis_. @xmath10 is normalized so that @xmath11 tends to @xmath12 on the rotation axis [ this latter condition ensures that the parameter @xmath13 associated with @xmath10 along its trajectories by @xmath14 has the standard @xmath15 periodicity ] .",
    "let us call @xmath7 the _ helicoidal killing vector_. we assume that @xmath7 is a symmetry generator not only for the spacetime metric @xmath16 but also for all the matter fields . in particular , @xmath7 is tangent to the world tubes representing the surface of each star , hence its qualification of _ helicoidal _ ( cf .",
    "figure  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the approximation suggested above amounts to neglecting outgoing gravitational radiation . for non - axisymmetric systems  as binaries are  imposing @xmath7 as an exact killing vector leads to a spacetime which is not asymptotically flat @xcite .",
    "thus , in solving for the gravitational field equations , a certain approximation has to be devised in order to avoid the divergence of some metric coefficients at infinity .",
    "for instance such an approximation could be the wilson & mathews scheme @xcite that amounts to solving only for the hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations , as well as the trace of the spatial part of the `` dynamical '' einstein equations ( cf .",
    "[ s : conf_flat ] ) .",
    "this approximation has been used in all the relativistic quasiequilibrium studies to date and is consistent with the existence of the helicoidal killing vector field ( [ e : helicoidal ] ) .",
    "note also that since the gravitational radiation reaction shows up only at the 2.5-pn order , the helicoidal symmetry is exact up to the 2-pn order .",
    "following the standard 3 + 1 formalism @xcite , we introduce a foliation of spacetime by a family of spacelike hypersurfaces @xmath17 such that at spatial infinity , the vector @xmath9 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ e : helicoidal ] ) is normal to @xmath17 and the adm 3-momentum in @xmath17 vanishes ( i.e. the time @xmath18 is the proper time of an asymptotic inertial observer at rest with respect to the binary system ) .",
    "asymptotically , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath13 is the azimuthal coordinate associated with the above asymptotic inertial observer , so that eq .  (",
    "[ e : helicoidal ] ) can be re - written as [ e : helicoidal_partial ] = t +  .",
    "one can then introduce the shift vector @xmath21 of co - orbiting coordinates by means of the orthogonal decomposition of @xmath7 with respect to the @xmath17 foliation : [ e : helicoidal_n ] = n - , where @xmath22 is the unit future directed vector normal to @xmath17 , @xmath23 is called the lapse function and @xmath24 .",
    "we consider a perfect fluid , which constitutes an excellent approximation for neutron star matter .",
    "the matter stress - energy tensor is then [ e : stress - energy ] = ( e+p ) + p  , @xmath25 being the fluid proper energy density , @xmath26 the fluid pressure , @xmath27 the fluid 4-velocity , and @xmath16 the spacetime metric . a zero - temperature equation of state ( eos ) is a very good approximation for neutron star matter .",
    "for such an eos , the first law of thermodynamics gives rise to the following identity ( gibbs - duhem relation ) : [ e : gibbs - duhem ] p e+p = 1h h  , where @xmath28 is the fluid specific enthalpy : h : = e+p m_b n , @xmath29 being the fluid baryon number density and @xmath30 the mean baryon mass : @xmath31 . note that for our zero - temperature eos , @xmath32 is equal to the fluid chemical potential .    by means of the identity ( [ e : gibbs - duhem ] ) , it is straightforward to show that the classical momentum - energy conservation equation @xmath33 is equivalent to the set of two equations@xcite : [ e : canon ] ( ) = 0  , [ e : baryon_conserv ] ( n ) = 0  . in eq .",

    "the vorticity 2-form enters cartan s identity which states that the lie derivative of the 1-form @xmath34 along the vector field @xmath7 is [ e : cartan ]  _ = ( ) + ( )  . because of the assumed helicoidal symmetry , @xmath36 , so that cartan s identity reduces to [ e : cartan2 ] ( ) + ( ) = 0  .",

    "the first term in the left - hand side vanishes by virtue of the equation of motion ( [ e : canon ] ) , so that we obtain ( ) = 0  , which means that the quantity @xmath37 is constant along each streamline .",
    "this is the relativistic generalization of the classical bernoulli theorem . at this stage",
    ", it must be noticed that , in order for the constant to be uniform over the streamlines , i.e. , to be a constant over spacetime , so that one gets a first integral for the fluid motion , some additional property of the flow must be required . in the following two sections , we explore two such additional properties : rigidity and irrotationality .",
    "a rigid motion corresponds to _ synchronized _ stars ( also called _ corotating _ stars ) .",
    "it is defined in relativity by the vanishing of the expansion tensor @xmath38 of the 4-velocity @xmath27 . in the presence of a killing vector @xmath7 ,",

    "inserting relation ( [ e : rigid ] ) into the equation of fluid motion ( [ e : canon ] ) shows that the first term in eq .",

    "this is equivalent to the existence of a scalar field @xmath41 such that [ e : potential_flow ] =  .",

    "note that the advantage of writing the equation for the fluid motion in the form ( [ e : canon])-([e : baryon_conserv ] ) rather than in the traditional form @xmath33 is that one can see immediately that a flow of the form ( [ e : potential_flow ] ) is a solution of ( [ e : canon ] ) .",

    "<S> we present a numerical method to compute quasiequilibrium configurations of close binary neutron stars in the pre - coalescing stage . </S>",
    "<S> a hydrodynamical treatment is performed under the assumption that the flow is either rigidly rotating or irrotational . </S>",
    "<S> the latter state is technically more complicated to treat than the former one ( synchronized binary ) , but is expected to represent fairly well the late evolutionary stages of a binary neutron star system . as regards the gravitational field , </S>",
    "<S> an approximation of general relativity is used , which amounts to solving five of the ten einstein equations ( conformally flat spatial metric ) . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained system of partial differential equations is solved by means of a multi - domain spectral method . </S>",
    "<S> two spherical coordinate systems are introduced , one centered on each star ; this results in a precise description of the stellar interiors . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the multi - domain approach , this high precision is extended to the strong field regions . </S>",
    "<S> the computational domain covers the whole space so that exact boundary conditions are set to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> extensive tests of the numerical code are performed , including comparisons with recent analytical solutions . </S>",
    "<S> finally a constant baryon number sequence ( evolutionary sequence ) is presented in details for a polytropic equation of state with @xmath0 .    </S>",
