    ", it appears that , in contrast to what happens in de sitter case , where the solutions are always stables independently of the value of the constant @xmath3 , we see that in the case of power - law solutions , depending on the value of @xmath3 , instability may appear .",
    "this fact is completely predictable and is linked with the behaviour of the ordinary energy density .",
    "the physical reason to this is the convergence presented by the quotient @xmath223 , the energy density at any time @xmath189 over the one at the current time @xmath192 .",
    "this reflects the fact that as the time evolves , the ordinary matter content reduces , whereas the dark content grows .",
    "let us show prove it in a more clearly way .",
    "first , since the parameter of the eos of the ordinary matter content @xmath224 is always positive , it is easy to observe from ( [ eq28 ] ) that , as the cosmic time evolves , the ordinary energy density goes to zero . from eq .",
    "( [ eq28 ] ) , the cosmic time may be extracted such that @xmath225 once again one can observe in a quantitative way that as the time evolves , the quantity @xmath226 is more negative , meaning that the quotient @xmath227 is much less that @xmath156 for large time , i.e , @xmath228 , which is a physical aspect .",
    "now , how does this reflect on the stability of the de sitter solutions and not on the power - law ones ?",
    "this is clear when we substitute the rhs of ( [ proof1 ] ) in the perturbations functions @xmath162 and @xmath161 in the de sitter case , getting @xmath229}\\\\ \\delta(t)&=&\\frac{k\\kappa^2\\rho_0}{h_0\\left(-6h_0+q\\sqrt{6}\\right)}\\exp{\\left[\\ln{\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{hm}}{\\rho_0}\\right)}-\\frac{\\kappa^2\\rho_0}{\\left(6h_0-q\\sqrt{6}\\right)h_0}\\frac{\\rho_{hm}(t)}{\\rho_0 } \\right]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] remark that from the value of @xmath3 in ( [ cvalue ] ) , one always has @xmath230 , meaning that the above perturbation functions are always defined .",
    "moreover , as the cosmic time evolves , i.e , @xmath231 , one falls in the situation where @xmath232 and @xmath233 by suitably adjusting the papers .",
    "this stability of the perturbation functions comes from the fact that these functions exclusively depend one the cosmological parameters related to ordinary matter .",
    "one the other hand , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq33 ] ) , ( [ eq35])-([eq36 ] ) , the perturbation functions for power - law solutions read @xmath234\\\\   \\delta(t)&=&- \\frac{\\kappa^{2}\\;\\rho_{0 } \\;k_{1}}{\\big(-6\\;h^{2}(t)+q\\;h(t)\\;\\sqrt{6 } \\big ) }    \\exp \\big \\{\\ln{\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{mh}}{\\rho_0}\\right ) } + \\cr   & & \\exp \\big [ \\frac{b}{\\tilde{a}\\;(1+m ) } \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{mh}}{\\rho_0}\\right)^{-\\frac{1+m}{3\\alpha(1+\\omega ) } } \\ ;   _ 2f_{1 } \\big(1,(1+m),(2+m),\\frac{-b}{\\tilde{a } } \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{mh}}{\\rho_0}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{3\\alpha(1+\\omega)}}\\big ) \\big ]   \\big \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this present case , one can observe that besides the ordinary content parameters , these functions also depend on the dark content parameters .",
    "more precisely the effect of the dark content is incorporated in the parameter @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the parameter of effective eos , as previously defined in the subsection @xmath237 .",
    "one sees that the convergence or not of the perturbations functions depends on the sign of @xmath238 .",
    "therefore , one can distinguish two interesting stages of the universe , according to which the stability may appear : the phantom and quintessence phases .",
    "so , if the universe lives the phantom phase , @xmath239 , the parameter @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 , such that , as the time evolve , i.e , @xmath231 , the argument of the hypergeometric functions goes to zero and the perturbation functions converge .",
    "however , in the quintessence phase , @xmath243 , the perturbation functions may diverge and then the stability is not always guaranteed .",
    "we see clearly from all this that , the ( in)stability of power - law solutions does not depend only of the ordinary content of the universe , but also on the dark ones .",
    "one can then conclude that the stability of the power - law solutions within the model being studied here depends on the stage in which the universe is living , phantom or quintessence . in the phantom phase , power - law solution present stability , while for the quintessence universe , the solutions are unstable .",
    "an interesting question to be answered is , do power - law solutions are stable in the limit @xmath244 ?",
    "this question can be answered by explicitly considering the expression of the parameter @xmath238 , that is , @xmath137 .",
    "observe that for both de sitter and power - law solutions , the expressions of the perturbation functions are essentially base on that of the scale factors .",
    "therefore , if an application can transform one of them to the other , a direct consequence can be deduced about their respective perturbations .",
    "more precisely , it is well known that for de sitter solutions , the parameter of eos is @xmath245 , @xmath246 . on the other hand , from the scale factor of the power - law solutions ( [ eq32 ] )",
    ", @xmath238 goes to @xmath247 if and only if @xmath245 , corresponding to de sitter solutions . the same question should be answered by extracting the time @xmath218 from ( [ eq32 ] ) and injecting it in ( [ eq35])-([eq36 ] ) and later , taking the limit @xmath244 .",
    "it is straightforward to observe that the perturbation functions converge .",
    "now , in order to point out the suitable condition for getting a whole stability we need to take into account both the above enumerative conditions . after an appropriate analysis , we see that for any @xmath213 , being odd or even , the stability of @xmath0 model is always ensured .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath143 , where both @xmath184 and @xmath174 converge as the time evolves . as performed in the de sitter case , we also present the evolution of the quotients @xmath185 and @xmath186 , where , once again , we see that the geometrical perturbation function is more stable than the one of the matter content . also , it is numerically obvious that the geometrical perturbation fade away asymptotically , while the matter perturbation continues existing but with a fix value for large time . for",
    "any other condition different from the above one , the model turn out to be unstable .    according to the two cosmological solutions ( de sitter and power - law solutions ) ,",
    "the sufficient condition for which the @xmath0 model in the context of @xmath1 gravity is stable is @xmath213 ( @xmath26 ) .    on the other hand , because of the fact that @xmath248 , it is easy to observe that the first and second laws are simultaneously satisfied for @xmath26 .     and",
    "@xmath174 as the time evolves in the case of de sitter solutions , showing their convergence ( stability of the model ) .",
    "the function are plotted for @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 . ]     and @xmath174 as the time evolves in the case of power - law solutions .",
    "the function are plotted for @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath254 , @xmath255 , @xmath253 . ]",
    "this paper is devoted to some features of the @xmath0 model if the framework of @xmath1 modified theory of gravity .",
    "we first perform the reconstruction of @xmath1 model according to mathematical aspect of the so - called @xmath0 .",
    "the model present an integration constant @xmath3 which played and important role in the study of the thermodynamics description and the stability of the model . in the view of thermodynamics and in order to carry out the effect of the modified algebraic function @xmath1 , we focused our attention on the equilibrium description of the thermodynamics , where we assumed that the temperature of the universe inside the horizon is equal to that of the apparent horizon .",
    "we shown that the first law of thermodynamics with an increasing additive entropy is realized only in quintessence - like universe .",
    "the first continue occurring in phantom - like universe but as the time evolves , this additive entropy fades away and the teleparallel aspect is recovered .",
    "the second law is satisfied only in quintessence phase .",
    "moreover , in order to check the viability of this model , we study its stability taking into account the de sitter and power - law cosmological solutions .",
    "the results show that within the de sitter solutions , the stability is always realized , whereas in the power - law one , the stability is obtained depending of the type of universe , phatom or quintessence - like .",
    "we see that in phantom phase , the stability is always satisfied , whereas , in quintessence - like universe solutions present instability .    furthermore , we mix the thermodynamics aspect and the stability one and point out the constraint on the integration constant for obtaining a viability of the model ( at least within these considerations ) . therefore , we observe that both thermodynamics laws and stability are realized only for a quintessence - like universe within de sitter solutions .",
