    "theoretical studies@xcite predict that the magnetic geometrically nonfrustrated diamond lattice can host a highly degenerate frustrated state consisting of coplanar spirals , the so - called spiral spin liquid ( ssl ) .",
    "this counterintuitive finding is comprehended when taking into account that the diamond lattice is composed of two interpenetrated face - centered cubic ( fcc ) sublattices which on their own are highly frustrated@xcite .",
    "the magnetic frustration of the overall diamond lattice is caused by a significant j@xmath0 interaction which couples nearest - neighbor sites within each fcc sublattice .",
    "the ssl should evolve@xcite when the ratio @xmath4/@xmath3 exceeds @xmath8 , while for lower @xmath4/@xmath3 a collinear antiferromagnet ( af ) should be the ground state .",
    "the labeling of j s reflects the fact that j@xmath9 is the nearest - neighbor coupling of the diamond lattice and j@xmath0 is the next - nearest - neighbor one .",
    "the degeneracy of the ssl could be lifted by thermal@xcite or quantum@xcite fluctuations resulting in a magnetic ordering transition via the order - by - disorder mechanism@xcite . within this scenario",
    "the ordered state selected by entropy has the highest density of nearby low - energy excitations .",
    "this model will be referred to as the @xmath4/@xmath3 or order - by - disorder model .",
    "+ coal@xmath0o@xmath1 is a good candidate to study ssl , as it adopts the spinel structure ab@xmath0o@xmath1 with magnetic co@xmath2 ions residing on the diamond lattice .",
    "however , there is no consensus to which extent the @xmath4/@xmath3 model is relevant for this system .",
    "the ratio @xmath4/@xmath3 determined from inelastic neutron scattering@xcite is only 0.109(2 ) , thus , according to the aforementioned model@xcite , this material should have a nondegenerate collinear af ground state",
    ". nevertheless , experimental observations by specific heat@xcite , muon spin relaxation@xcite , neutron diffraction@xcite are rather consistent with an unconventional ground state , which might be the ssl .",
    "several models have been proposed in the past to explain this behaviour , such as the order - by - disorder @xcite , an order - by - quenched - disorder @xcite or a kinetically inhibited order @xcite models .",
    "+ in this work we investigate the relevance of an order - by - quenched - disorder model to our system .",
    "it is focused on the well - known experimental fact that materials with the spinel structure could have a significant degree of an a / b antisite inversion .",
    "that is , b - atoms occupy the a - site and a - atoms - the b - site . in coal@xmath0o@xmath1 samples studied so far@xcite the co",
    "/ al inversion @xmath10 varies from 2 to 17% .",
    "the theory@xcite predicts that impurities would break the degeneracy of the spiral spin liquid and would induce an ordered magnetic ground state , which is different from the one favoured by the order - by - disorder mechanism .",
    "finally , the kinetically inhibited order model infers that in coal@xmath0o@xmath1 freezing of magnetic domain walls prevents a true long - range order , @xmath11 the thermal energy is too small to overcome the surface energy of domain walls .",
    "thus the size of domains stays arrested at lowest temperatures even in the absence of antisite disorder .",
    "+ for better understanding of the nonconventional magnetic order in the coal@xmath0o@xmath1 system we focus on neutron single crystal diffraction which probes spin - spin correlations and thus should be able to distinguish the models introduced above .",
    "we calculate diffraction patterns for magnetic moment arrangements obtained by the classical monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations varying the @xmath4/@xmath3 ratio , magnetic field and disorder on the a- and b- sites and compare those with experimental patterns .",
    "measurements of susceptibility , magnetization and specific heat complement our neutron diffraction results .",
    "we conclude that both , the frustration due to the @xmath4/@xmath3 ratio and the presence of the antisite disorder , play a significant role in the observed atypical magnetic ordering .",
    "we anticipate that disorder is not random , presumably it happens at @xmath6111@xmath7-twin boundaries restricting the propagation of the collinear af state .",

    "[ sec3 ] our experimental data on our coal@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystal are presented .",
    "our macroscopic ( susceptibility , magnetization and specific heat ) and microscopic ( single crystal neutron diffraction in zero and in the applied magnetic field ) experimental findings confirm that the magnetic order in the frustrated diamond lattice antiferromagnet coal@xmath0o@xmath1 is unconventional .",
    "comparison of bulk properties of our crystal with those of other studied samples identifies our crystal as located in the spin liquid regime@xcite and its magnetic properties are isotropic on the macroscopic scale .",
    "this is definitely not the case on the microscopic level as testified by neutron diffraction .",
    "single crystal patterns reveal that changes of magnetic correlations with the applied field are anisotropic .",
    "the patterns are similar to those calculated from the monte - carlo models , but none of the considered models explains the data completely . in zero field , the measured peaks are broadened , as the model with a - defects predicts , however , the anticipated ferromagnetic contribution is missing .",
    "in addition , while the experimentally observed increase of long - range af correlations for h@xmath25110@xmath21 $ ] is in accord with this model , its decrease for h@xmath25100@xmath21 $ ] contradicts the predictions .",
    "furthermore , the presence of random b - defects should induce broad ferromagnetic features , but they are not observed in the experiment .",
    "+ thus , the magnetic behaviour in the studied material is not captured by simplistic models supposing random disorder on the a- and b - sites considered so far .",
    "one of the possible reasons of the failure could be different electronic states of the defect atoms as the assumed ones .",
    "for example , the co@xmath53 ions inserted into the octahedral b - sites are assumed to be in the same spin state as in the a - site .",
    "however dft calculations @xcite suggest the low spin configuration for the co@xmath53 ions in the octahedral coordination for the inversion levels up to @xmath10=50% .",
    "another possible reason of disagreement could be a complex morphology of defects which we assumed to be random .",
    "spinels are known to form complicated twin structures @xcite , which lead to stacking faults of the @xmath6111@xmath7 planes .",
    "such faults have been observed in mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) @xcite .",
    "starting from the ideal spinel structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ( a ) a stacking fault develop at the ( 111 ) plane indicated by the black solid line . at such twin boundary",
    "the cation composition can be either preserved ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] b ) , or it can become b(al)-rich ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] c ) or a(co)-rich ( fig .  [ fig8 ] d ) .",
    "if the distribution of stacking faults is similar in all eight directions within the @xmath6111@xmath7 family , macroscopic magnetic properties of a crystal would remain also isotropic .",
    "+ clearly , the frustration due to the @xmath4/@xmath3 ratio is the basic ingredient of the magnetic behaviour of coal@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this is the case even when the @xmath4/@xmath3 ratio is below @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath4/@xmath3 model correctly predicts the temperature evolution of specific heat , the wave vector of magnetic ordering and the presence of low - lying excited states with @xmath54= @xmath6111@xmath7 .",
    "however , not all experimental observations emerge from the @xmath4/@xmath3 physics . both , the difference in zfc / fc susceptibility and the broadening of the af peaks in neutron diffraction result from the antisite disorder .",
    "comparison of neutron patterns from the mc modelling and the experiment prompts that these models are too simplistic .",
    "tem would be the key method for a systematic study of the microstructure and its influence on magnetic correlations in this material reconciling contradicting isotropic macroscopic and anisotropic microscopic observations .",
