    "in the hot and dense system of strongly interacting matter created in heavy ion collisions the mean free path of the particles is much smaller than the size of the fireball .",
    "this fact together with the assumption of fast thermal equilibration allows to apply relativistic hydrodynamics for the dynamical description of heavy ion collisions . at later times of the evolution and at its edges",
    "the system is dilute , the mean free path is larger than system size , and hydrodynamics is not applicable .",
    "an adequate description of the system in those circumstances is provided by kinetic ( transport ) equations , such as the boltzmann equation or its modifications for the quantum case .",
    "state of the art simulations of heavy ion collisions couple hydrodynamics for the early stage of the evolution to hadron transport for the late stage .",
    "such approaches are called hybrid approaches  @xcite .    the transition from hydrodynamics to transport ( so - called particlization ) is non - trivial , because hydrodynamics contains no microscopic information that is needed for transport . currently , most of the models implement particlization in the following way .",
    "hydrodynamical equations are solved in the whole forward light cone , including those regions , where hydrodynamics is not applicable .",
    "then the particlization hypersurface is found from the hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "usually a hypersurface of constant time , temperature or energy density is taken .",
    "particle distributions to be fed into the kinetic model are generated on this hypersurface according to the cooper - frye formula  @xcite : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is a spectrum of particles emerging from an element of the hypersurface , @xmath4 is the normal four - vector to the hypersurface , its length being equal to the area of hypersurface element . in ideal fluid calculations",
    "the distribution function @xmath5 is taken as an equilibrium fermi or bose distribution : @xmath6^{-1}$ ] .",
    "an advantage of the cooper - frye formula is that it respects conservation laws .",
    "the disadvantage is that for space - like elements of the hypersurface ( _ i.e. _ where @xmath7 ) there exist particle momenta @xmath8 such that @xmath9 and thus @xmath10 in the cooper - frye formula .",
    "this is clearly unphysical , because the number of particles must be positive in every element of phase space .",
    "however , in all practical cases after integration over the hypersurface one gets positive definite spectra .",
    "one can split the integrated cooper - frye formula into positive and negative parts : @xmath11 the second term is called cooper - frye negative contributions and the first one - positive . for the applicability of the cooper - frye formula the negative contributions must be much smaller than the positive ones .",
    "this is usually true for simulations of high energy collisions .",
    "negative contributions of around 9% relative to the positive ones were reported for rhic top energy  @xcite . at the same time negative contributions at @xmath12gev were found to be around 13% .",
    "this suggests that at lower collision energies negative contributions might become large and cooper - frye formula will be inapplicable .",
    "does it really happen ? to answer this question we systematically investigate the negative cooper - frye contributions differentially in rapidity and transverse momentum against collision energy , centrality and particle species .",
    "several ways to circumvent the problem of negative contributions were suggested ( see   @xcite for a short summary ) .",
    "one practical way to do it in hybrid models would be to simultaneously neglect negative contributions and remove the particles from the transport calculation , if they fly to the hydrodynamic region .",
    "if the distributions in hydrodynamics and cascade are the same , then conservation laws will be fulfilled .",
    "such an approach has never been implemented . to check",
    "if it is feasible , we compare negative contributions from the cooper - frye formula to distributions of backscattered particles from the cascade .",
    "we take advantage of the coarse - grained approach , which allows to calculate both within one framework .",
    "we aim at two goals : systematic estimation of cooper - frye negative contributions and comparing them to distributions of transport particles flying inwards to the hydrodynamics region . as a transport model",
    "we take ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd 3.3p2 )  @xcite .",
    "urqmd allows to simulate heavy ion collisions as a sequence of elementary particle collisions .",
    "included processes are 2 to 2 scattering , resonance formation and decays , string excitation and fragmentation .",
    "we generate an ensemble of urqmd au+au collision events and average them on a rectangular grid to obtain the energy momentum tensor @xmath13 and the baryon current @xmath14 in each cell . in each cell",
    "we find the landau rest frame ( lrf , a frame , where energy flow is zero : @xmath15 ) .",
    "we obtain the energy density @xmath16 , flow velocity @xmath17 and baryon density in the lrf @xmath18 .",
    "knowing @xmath19 for each grid cell we construct the hypersurface @xmath20 of constant @xmath19 and find the normal vectors @xmath4 for each piece of @xmath20 .",
    "the latter is done using the cornelius subroutine  @xcite , that provides a continuous surface without holes and avoids double counting of hypersurface pieces .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath20 mimics the transition hypersurface in hybrid models .",
    "when @xmath20 is obtained we perform a cooper - frye calculation on it and compare to distributions of underlying urqmd particles that cross @xmath20 .",
    "we perform our calculations with time step @xmath21 = 0.1 fm / c , grid spacing in the beam direction @xmath220.3 fm , and grid spacings in transverse direction @xmath23 = 1 fm . for collision energy @xmath12 gev we take @xmath220.1 fm , and @xmath23 = 0.3 fm .",
    "we have checked that for such a choice of grid spacing conservation laws on the surface are fulfilled with an accuracy better than 1% . in other words",
    "@xmath24 and total energy flowing out of the hypersurface calculated by particles differ by no more than 1% . to create a smooth hypersurface and obtain reproducible results we employ a gaussian smearing procedure . for the construction of the hypersurface every urqmd particle with coordinates @xmath25 and 4-momentum @xmath8",
    "is substituted by 300 marker particles with coordinates distributed with the probability density @xmath26 , where @xmath27 . in this way",
    "every particle contributes to @xmath13 and @xmath14 not only of the cell , where it is located , but also to the adjacent cells .",
    "we take as number of events @xmath28 and the gaussian width @xmath29 fm .",
    "choice of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , grid spacing and sensitivity of results to these choices are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "if the distribution of urqmd particles is thermal on some closed hypersurface and the system is in chemical equilibrium , then the cooper - frye formula should give results identical to explicit particle counting .",
    "this would allow to compensate negative contributions by removing particles from urqmd , if they cross the hypersurface inwards .",
    "in such a treatment conservation laws on the surface would be respected .",

    ". it might be possible to explain this as a sign of chemical non - equilibrium in urqmd , but when one looks at the positive and negative contributions to the pion distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pos_contr_rap ] , one sees that a difference in the pion density only is not sufficient to explain the differences in the contributions .",
    "the positive contribution is much larger in urqmd than in the cooper - frye calculation , whereas the negative contribution depicts the opposite behaviour : in urqmd it is much smaller than in the cooper - frye scenario .",
    "this kind of distributions may indicate that the collective flow velocity of pions is much larger than the collective velocity of other particles  @xcite , or that the dissipative corrections are very large .",
    "since neither negative contributions coincide with inward crossings , nor positive contributions coincide with outward crossings , the above mentioned idea of compensating negative contributions will not work in our case .",
    "instead we concentrate on finding when negative contributions play the most prominent role , and evaluate the ratio of negative contributions to positive ones to estimate the error they bring into hybrid calculations . for",
    "that we vary hadron sort , collision energy and centrality . as a relevant variable we consider the ratio of negative to positive contributions integrated over the hypersurface , @xmath39 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : neg_contr_pmass ] one can see that negative contributions become smaller for larger particle mass .",
    "it is simple to understand this result in the rest frame of the fluid element where the surface is moving .",
    "if the hypersurface @xmath20 moves inwards , as is usually the case in fluid - dynamical calculations , a particle must be faster than the surface to cross it inwards .",
    "for larger particle mass the average velocities of the thermal motion are smaller and the probability to catch up the hypersurface is also smaller .",
    "therefore , to find maximal negative contributions it is sufficient to consider pions only . for them",
    "we find out that if negative contributions are binned according to rapidity , then the largest contribution occurs at midrapidity .",

    "this is not obvious , because several factors influence the ratio : the temperature on the hypersurface , the relative velocities between the flow and the surface , and the relative amounts of volume and surface emission , _",
    "i.e. _ emission from the time- and space - like parts of the surface .",
    "larger temperature results in larger negative contributions because the thermal velocities increase .",
    "larger relative velocity leads to smaller negative contributions .",
    "the larger the relative amount of volume - emission , the smaller the negative contributions . with increasing collision energies the temperature saturates and",
    "thus the changes in the last two factors make negative contributions fall with increasing collision energy .",
    "the decrease of negative contributions at higher energy is predictable , because the relative amount of volume emission and relative velocity between flow and surface increase with collision energy .",
    "however , the behaviour of negative contributions at lower energy is caused by the interplay of all three factors .",

    "[ fig : neg_contr_b ] , and find that for peripheral collisions negative contributions are smaller than for central collisions . the relative amount of surface and volume emission plays the most prominent role here . for peripheral collisions volume emission dominates due to the short lifetime of the system and negative contributions",
