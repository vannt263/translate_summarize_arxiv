    "realization of cooling of mechanical motion within the vicinity of quantum regime is a key ingredient for the broad range of its applications , including quantum information processing ( qip )  @xcite , high - precision measurement  @xcite , and probe of quantum behaviour of macroscopic system  @xcite , etc .",
    "recently , theoretical and experimental studies are mainly focused on the linearized treatment of linear coupling optomechanical system , where the coupling term is proportional to the mechanical displacement @xmath0  @xcite . however , there are some literatures have begun to generalize the investigations on the nonlinear mechanical cooling processes , such as second - sideband laser cooling of trapped ions  @xcite and cooling in the single - photon strong optomechanical coupling regime  @xcite , which can lead to nonthermal steady states , and even the nonclassical , sub - poissonian states , and quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium hold great promise for the investigation of fundamental physics and the implementation of practical devices  @xcite .    by now a new type of optomechanical system , i.e. , quadratic optomechanics , has been proposed , where the coupling term is proportional to square of mechanical displacement @xmath1 , which is realizable in the setups of membrane - in - the - middle optomechanical system , ultracold atomic ensembles and superconducting electrical circuit systems  @xcite .",
    "distinct from the displacement of mechanical equilibrium position in the linear coupling optomechanics , the quadratic coupling will modify the resonant frequency of the mechanical oscillator  @xcite .",
    "thus the quadratic optomechanical system can be used for quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement of individual quantum jumps  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the robust stationary mechanical squeezing and electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) from two - phonon processes in quadratic optomechanical system are also achievable  @xcite . for the practical applications one should minimize the influence of thermal noise , and linearized approach on the cooling of quadratically",
    "coupled mechanical oscillator has been studied in ref .  @xcite . with the advancement of experimental technology ,",
    "now it will become attractive to theoretically investigate the nonlinear cooling processes induced by the intrinsic quadratical coupling .",
    "for example , utilizing avoided crossings effects in a multi - mode optical cavity containing a flexible dielectric membrane enables the significantly enhanced quadratical coupling strength that can reach @xmath2  @xcite ; in the superconducting electrical circuit quadratic optomechanical system , the coupling strength @xmath3 compared to dissipation rate @xmath4 could be raised to @xmath5  @xcite ; cavity optomechanical system with ultracold atomic ensembles also provides an obvious characterization of quadratic - coupling regime  @xcite .",
    "these platforms offer the possibility to enter the single - photon strong quadratically optomechanical coupling regime .    here",
    ", we investigate the nonlinear mechanical cooling processes in the intrinsic quadratically optomechanical coupling regime without linearizing the optomechanical interaction .",
    "we apply the scattering theory to calculate the transition rates between different mechanical fock states with use of the method of resolvent of hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "this approach allows for a clear identification of the underlying physical processes , where only even - phonon transitions are permitted while the odd - phonon transitions are prohibited . in the paper",
    "we first derive the mechanical transition rates , verify the consistence of transition rates with the results of the simulation of full quantum master equation under the consideration of thermal mechanical damping , and then discuss the analytical results in the weak coupling limit that coincide with two - phonon mechanical cooling processes  @xcite . to indicate the difference to the linear coupling optomechanical system by evaluating the mandel @xmath6 parameter , it tends to achieve the nonclassical mechanical states in quadratical optomechanics .",
    "furthermore , we apply the phonon number fluctuations @xmath7 to present that the even - phonon transitions favor to suppress the phonon number fluctuations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the quadratical optomechanical system is introduced , in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the scattering theory on the single - photon quadratically optoemchanical cooling process is presented and the cooling limits in the weak and strong coupling regimes are discussed , and in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] the nonthermal and nonclassical statistical properties of the mechanical oscillator is analyzed . at last",
    "the conclusions are given .",
    "we consider the quadratically coupled optomechanical system in which an optical cavity mode is parametrically coupled to the square of the position of a mechanical oscillator , and the hamiltonian is written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the frequency of the cavity mode @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the frequency of the mechanical mode @xmath12 , and @xmath3 is the quadratically optomechanical coupling strength between the cavity mode and mechanical motion of the oscillator . in order to make the present system stable , the routh - hurwitz criterion implies that the condition @xmath13 should be satisfied , in which @xmath14 is the number of photons inside the cavity . in",
    "the frame rotating at the driving laser s frequency @xmath15 , the drive is described by the hamiltonian @xmath16 with the driving strength @xmath17 .",
    "we are looking forward to the regime @xmath18 , where @xmath4 is the damping rate of the cavity field , and thus the cavity states with more than one photon can be neglected .",
    "the damping of the cavity field is described by the interaction between the mode @xmath10 and the environmental mode @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the free dynamics of the electromagnetic field external to resonator in the reference frame rotating at the laser frequency @xmath15 . here",
    ", the sum runs over all modes , identified by the wave vector @xmath21 and orthogonal polarization @xmath22 , the operators @xmath19 and @xmath23 annihilate and create photons in the corresponding mode , and @xmath24 denotes the mode frequency . the cavity - environment interaction @xmath25 accounts for the coupling of the cavity mode with the modes of the external radiation field and the explicit expressions of coupling constant",
    "@xmath26 can be referred in literatures  @xcite .",
    "the interaction gives the losses of the cavity at rate @xmath4 , with the definition @xmath27 the mechanical dissipation rate is usually much smaller than the cavity damping rate , and we will take it into consideration in the following .",
    "in this paper we will resort to the scattering theory to explicitly evaluate the transition rates which quantitatively determine the cooling and heating processes .",
    "this approach will allow for a direct identification of the underlying physical processes .",
    "for convenience we separate the total system hamiltonian according to @xmath28 , where the redefined main operator @xmath29 combines eq .   and free electromagnetic field , i.e. , @xmath30 and the small interaction part is @xmath31 in which @xmath32 is the detuning between laser @xmath15 and resonator frequency @xmath9 . in the case of weak optical drive strength @xmath17 , it is sufficient to work to second order of @xmath17 in the transition rate to well describe the scattering processes .",
    "here we suppose that the initial state is @xmath33 , where the cavity mode is in the vacuum state @xmath34 , @xmath35 is phononic excitations and @xmath36 is environmental vacuum mode .",
    "we are interested in the processes that change the motional state of the membrane induced by one photon followed by dissipation to environment , and denote the final states @xmath37 .",
    "thus we only need to retain the transition amplitude proportional to @xmath17 , which is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the resolvent of the effective hamiltonian @xmath40 under the consideration of cavity damping , and @xmath41 is the energy of initial state  @xcite . with the help of polaron transformation @xmath42\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the relation @xmath43[\\hat{u}(z-\\hat{h}^\\text{eff}_0)\\hat{u}^\\dag]=\\textbf{i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the identity matrix , the resolvent of the effective hamiltonian can be reexpressed as @xmath45 by applying the form of polaron transformation , the transformation of the effective hamiltonian becomes @xmath46 .",
    "\\label{unitraytrans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the explicit form of interaction part @xmath47 in eq .   and using the initial state @xmath48 and final state @xmath49",
    ", we can find out that the nonzero part of transition amplitude is @xmath50 in which @xmath51{\\left\\vert{n}\\right\\rangle}$ ] with @xmath52 is the coefficient of squeezed number state in fock representation and defined as  @xcite @xmath53}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\text{floor}[\\frac{n}{2 } ] } \\frac{(-1)^k}{k^\\prime!k!}\\nonumber\\\\&\\times\\frac{(\\frac{1}{2}\\tanh\\xi)^{k^\\prime+k}}{(n-2k)!}(\\cosh\\xi)^{2k}\\delta_{l-2k^\\prime , n-2k},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function floor[@xmath0 ] gives the greatest integer less than or equal to @xmath0 , and @xmath55 is the one - photon coupled membrane s resonant frequency  @xcite .",
    "then the corresponding transition rate is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57-function guarantees the energy conservation and the sum covers all relevant polarizations and wave vectors . the transition rate becomes @xmath58 with the definition of cavity damping in eq .  , the transition rate which denotes the change of the motional state of mechanical oscillator from @xmath59 to @xmath60 phonons becomes @xmath61 equation   presents a clear physical view on the process of an incident photon scattered by the quadratic cavity - optomechanical system with changing the motion of mechanical oscillator from @xmath59 to @xmath60 phonons .",
    "when a laser photon turns into the cavity photon , the phonon state changes from the initial number @xmath59 to an intermediate number @xmath62 demanding that @xmath63 is even due to the term of two - phonon operators , and the amplitude is inversely proportional to the frequency detuning @xmath64 which relates to the photon - coupled membrane s resonant frequency @xmath65 , and proportional to the matrix element of squeezed number state @xmath66 . as the photon leaves the cavity and dissipates into the continuum of modes in free space , it induces a transition in mechanical motion from @xmath62 to @xmath60 phonons which also demands that @xmath67 is even , and its amplitude is independent of driving detuning but dependent on the cavity - reservoir coupling strength @xmath26 , and also determined by the coefficient of squeezed number state @xmath68 for the two - phonon term .",
    "the output photon possesses the energy @xmath69 and carries away @xmath70 phonons , in which @xmath70 should be even since @xmath63 and @xmath67 are both even .",
    "now we stress the differences of nonlinear cooling rates between quadratical and linear coupling optomechanical systems .",
    "the quadratical optomechanical coupling modifies the mechanical frequency of the oscillator while the linear coupling just displaces the mechanical equilibrium position .",
    "thus the frequency detuning of the transition @xmath71 is closely dependent on the coupling strength @xmath3 while the effective detuning in the linear coupling optomechanics is independent of the coupling strength in the single - photon level .",
    "moreover , the transition amplitude of the linear coupling optomechanics is proportional to the franck - condon overlap factor for the single - phonon operators while the transition amplitude is proportional to the matrix elements of squeezed number state for the two - phonon operators .",
    "therefore , the form of transition rate in eq .",
    "is different from that of linear coupling optomechanical system in ref .",
    "@xcite , and may be helpful to generate more interesting mechanical states .",
    "taking into account of the thermal damping of mechanical oscillator with rate @xmath72 and thermal phonon number @xmath73 , the set of rate equations for the mechanical oscillator becomes @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the phonon number distribution in the @xmath59 phonon state .",
    "the occurrence of cooling processes in the strong quadratical coupling regime can absorb multiple two - phonons , and modify the eigenfrequency of mechanical oscillator simultaneously , which can lead to the generation of uncommon mechanical states . to understand this behavior we first consider the case of resolved - sideband limit @xmath76 and weak quadratical coupling limit @xmath77 , where the scattering is mainly dominated by the two - phonon transitions @xmath78 , and the rates in eq .",
    "are explicitly simplified as @xmath79 and @xmath80 in these limits , in which @xmath81 describe the strengths of two - phonon absorption and emission processes .",
    "the results are consistent with effective two - phonon quadratically mechanical cooling theory  @xcite , in which the cavity photon is linearized and then served as the two - phonon reservoir in the weak optomechanical coupling limit .",
    "the set of rate equation in eq .   becomes @xmath82\\nonumber\\\\&-\\gamma_m n_\\text{th}[(n+1)p_n - np_{n-1}]\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\gamma_\\downarrow[(n+1)(n+2)p_{n+2}-n(n-1)p_n]\\nonumber\\\\&-\\gamma_\\uparrow[(n+1)(n+2)p_n - n(n-1)p_{n-2 } ] .",
    "\\label{eq : srate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the high - q mechanical oscillator and low initial temperature , i.e. , @xmath83 , we can ignore the thermal damping effects .",
    "the cooling process turns to be the pure two - phonon transitions , and the phonon number distribution @xmath75 can be analytically solved and expressed in the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 characterizes the relative weight of the odd phonon states determined by the initial conditions  @xcite . in the resolved - sideband regime ,",
    "when the detuning satisfies @xmath87 , the two - phonon absorption process dominates the emission process , i.e. , @xmath88 , and the phonon number distribution is concentrated at zero- and one - phonon states @xmath89 , @xmath90 , which indicates that two - phonon cooling processes preserve the phonon - number parity , leading to the initial odd phonon states cooled to the one - phonon state and the even phonon states cooled to the zero - phonon state independently .    in the strong two - phonon absorption regime @xmath91 , which is achievable with @xmath87 in the resolved - sideband limit ,",
    "finally we can obtain  @xcite @xmath92 thus the minimal mean phonon number @xmath93 , and the mandel @xmath6 factor that is defined as @xmath94 with @xmath95 becomes @xmath96 , which shows sub - possionian phonon distribution .",
    "thus the membrane is in a nonclassical mechanical state .      in the strong coupling regime",
    "higher - order mechanical sidebands appear and the multiple two - phonon transitions begin to work . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nphonon ] we plot the steady - state phonon number @xmath97 as a function of detuning @xmath32 with different coupling strengths @xmath98 .",
    "we observe that in the weak coupling and the resolved - sideband limits , i.e. , @xmath99 , the optimal cooling occurs at the detuning @xmath87 and the cooling limit reaches the value close to @xmath100 , which is in accordance to eq .  .",
    "in the strong coupling limit , the efficient cooling processes occur at the multiple two - phonon resonances @xmath101 , where the multiple dips of the evolution of @xmath102 indicate the occurrence of the multiple two - phonon transitions , which will further influence the statistical properties of the mechanical oscillator .     in single - photon quadratical optomechanical system as a function of detuning @xmath103 with the coupling strengths @xmath104 ( red solid line and green squares ) , @xmath105 ( blue dashed line and yellow circles ) and @xmath99 ( green dash - dotted line and magenta diamonds ) .",
