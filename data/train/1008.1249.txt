    "during the last three decades , the study of spin glasses ( sgs ) has attracted the interest of several researchers in both experimental and theoretical groups . in such magnetic system ,",
    "the disorder and frustrations give rise to a complex behavior that it is far from being completely understood .",
    "a fundamental problem is to determine the true nature of the low temperature phase . with this purpose ,",
    "the experimental and simulations results are commonly analyzed in the framework of two theories : the replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) or mean field picture @xcite and the droplet picture .",
    "@xcite while the droplet picture predicts a simple scenario with only two pure states related each other by an up - down symmetry , by using the formalism of rsb one finds a non - trivial phase space broken in many ergodic components and with an ultrametric topology . in spite of the effort put to solve this problem , the controversy about the phase - space structure of sgs remains unresolved .",
    "recently a different approach @xcite has been proposed to analyze the simulation data of the edwards - anderson bimodal ( eab ) spin glass model .",
    "@xcite in the same spirit of the droplet picture , which focuses on the ground state ( gs ) and their excitations , in this approach it is assumed that the gs heterogeneities play a fundamental role to describe the low - temperature behavior of sg systems . in the eab model",
    "the fundamental level is degenerate and the spatial heterogeneities are well characterized by the so - called _ rigid lattice _ ( rl ) .",
    "@xcite this structure is composed by the set of bonds which do not change its condition ( satisfied or frustrated ) in all the configurations of the gs .",
    "these bonds are called _ rigid bonds_. the remaining ones , called _ flexible bonds _ ,",
    "form the _ flexible lattice _",
    "( fl ) . in ref .",
    ", it was shown that in three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattices the distributions of domain - wall energies are very different in these two lattices : while the defect energy on the rl shows a dependence with the system size typical of a highly stable phase ( similar to the 3d ferromagnetic ising model , but with a fractal dimension larger than 2 ) , on the fl this quantity shows a very different behavior , rather like a system in an excited state . the total defect energy , that is , the sum of these two contributions , shows a low stability with a small ( but positive ) stiffness exponent .",
    "the same idea has been used to analyze the strong heterogeneities observed in the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the eab model .",
    "for example , in the 3d eab model the mean flipping time probability distribution function presents two main peaks , corresponding to fast and slow degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) and 3d eab model , it has been possible to show that these slow and fast peaks are related to the sets of _ solidary _ ( s ) and _ non - solidary _ ( ns ) spins , respectively .",
    "@xcite the set s consists of spins which maintain their relative orientation in all configurations of the gs ( the remaining spins are denoted ns spins ) .",
    "backbone _ of the eab model is characterized both by the bonds of the rl and by the s spins .",
    "in addition , the dynamical heterogeneities in the violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) for the 3d eab model were studied in the same way .",
    "@xcite dividing the system into sets s and ns , numerical simulations show that the violation of fdt is the result of two components with completely different behaviors : one that tends to satisfy the fdt relation ( set of ns spins ) , and another which presents a violation of this relation similar to coarsening systems ( set of s spins ) .",
    "the concept of backbone is also relevant in computer science , and in particular in the analysis of the @xmath0-satisfiability ( @xmath0-sat ) problem , a paradigmatic model belonging to the np - complete class of problems .",
    "@xcite in this case one has to assign a binary value to a set of variables so as to satisfy the largest possible number of a given set of clauses .",
    "the backbone is defined as the set of variables that take the same values in all optimal assignments .",
    "it has been found that the phase transition separating satisfiable from unsatisfiable formulas is characterized by the size of the backbone , which arises as a natural order parameter .",
    "@xcite in addition , the nature of the change in the backbone size at the transition ( continuous or discontinuous ) can be used to explain the onset of exponential complexity that occurs when going from @xmath1-sat , a problem solvable in polynomial time , to @xmath2-sat , an np - complete problem .",
    "these studies show that the backbone plays an important role in the physical behavior of disorder and frustrated systems .",
    "in all the mentioned cases the separation of the systems in two components is not trivial : the observables evaluated on the backbone region or their complement behaves very differently .",
    "more surprising is the fact that in the eab spin glass model the physics displayed in each one of these components looks similar to a ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase of the ising model , respectively . given this context , we think that an exhaustive study of the backbone structure can give interesting insights to understand the nature of the low temperature phases in spin glasses .    in this work we have carried out a systematic study of the backbone structure of the 2d and 3d eab spin glass model . we find that frustration is much lower in the backbone than in its complement . using equilibrium simulations we observe that this property can be found even above the critical temperature .",
    "these findings , together with the results mentioned in the previous paragraphs , lead us to propose that a separate study , in the backbone and its complement , of the different quantities that characterize the system , could lead to a better understanding of the low temperature phase of spin glasses .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ modalg ] we present the eab model and the algorithm used to calculate the rl and the s spins .",
    "numerical results that characterize the backbone structure are presented in sec .",
    "[ numres ] .",
    "then , an extensive discussion is given in sec .",
    "[ dis ] to show the importance of considering the gs topology in spin glasses .",
    "finally conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "we start by considering the hamiltonian of the eab model , @xcite @xmath3 where the sum runs over the nearest neighbors of either a 2d ( square ) or 3d ( cubic ) lattice of linear dimension @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath6 ising spin variables .",
    "the coupling constants are independent random variables chosen from a @xmath7 bimodal distribution with zero mean and variance one ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) .",
    "samples ( particular realizations of random bond distribution ) in 2d were generated with both periodic - free boundary conditions ( pfbc ) and periodic - periodic boundary conditions ( ppbc ) , while in 3d only periodic boundary conditions in all directions were used . because of the fact that the bonds are independent variables , for relatively large system sizes only configurations with half of the bonds of each sign are statistically significant . to preserve this feature for small sizes",
    ", we explicitly enforce the constraint @xmath9 specifically , for systems with an odd number of bonds , we enforce the constraint @xmath10 for half of the samples and @xmath11 for the other half .",
    "@xcite     with ppbc .",
    "single and double lines indicate ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic bonds , respectively .",
    "( b ) the corresponding rl .",
    "solid ( blue ) and dot ( red ) lines indicate rigid bonds which are , respectively , satisfied and frustrated in the gs .",
    "the s spins are indicated with circles ( closed and open circles correspond to different spin orientations ) . ]    for the eab model , which has a degenerate gs , the rl is defined as the set of bonds which do not change its condition ( satisfied or frustrated ) through all the configurations of the gs .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] shows the rl of a typical 2d sample of @xmath12 with ppbc ( flexible bonds are not shown ) . in 2d , it is only possible to obtain all the gss only for small system sizes because the number of configurations grows exponentially with @xmath4 .",
    "thus , only for samples with @xmath13 we have performed an exhaustive search of all the gss , using a branch - and - bound algorithm , in order to obtain the rl .",
    "@xcite for larger lattice sizes a different approach must be used , because for already @xmath14 the number of gs configurations becomes larger than @xmath15 .",
    "recently we have shown that the rl can be obtained by calculating only @xmath16 gs configurations , where @xmath16 is the number of bonds .",
    "@xcite the corresponding algorithm , called rigid lattice searching algorithm ( rlsa ) is valid for any lattice geometry in any dimensions . assuming that one has a method for obtaining a gs configuration of the system , the rlsa can be described as follows :    1 .   for a given sample ,",
    "a gs configuration @xmath17 is calculated and its energy @xmath18 is stored .",
    "a bond @xmath19 is chosen at random .",
    "the system being in configuration @xmath17 , one of the spins joined by the bond @xmath19 , i.e. either @xmath20 or @xmath21 , is flipped .",
    "this changes the  condition \" of the bond from satisfied to frustrated or viceversa .",
    "the orientation of the spins @xmath22 and @xmath23 is frozen , and for this  constrained \" system a gs configuration @xmath24 of energy @xmath25 is calculated .",
    "the freezing of the spins enforces the constraint that the bond @xmath19 will have the same condition in all gs configurations .",
    "5 .   if @xmath26 , then @xmath19 is a rigid bond which is satisfied ( frustrated ) in all gs configurations of the original , unconstrained , system , if @xmath19 was satisfied ( frustrated ) in @xmath17 .",
    "the bond is added to the rl 6 .",
    "if @xmath27 , then @xmath19 is a flexible bond , and it is added to the fl . 7 .   the bond @xmath19 is added to the list of  interrogated \" bonds , and the restriction over the spins @xmath20 or @xmath21 is lifted .",
    "8 .   if there are still non - interrogated bonds , a new bond @xmath19 is chosen among them and the process is repeated from step 3 .    a significant speedup of the algorithm can be obtained if each time that a new gs configuration of the system is obtained ( step 6 ) , new configurations are explored by performing single spin flips .",
    "there are usually some spins , called _ free spins _ , whose flipping does not change the energy of the state , leading thus to new gss .",
    "this procedure , called _ invasion _ , allows us to explore a local ensemble of gss ( leg),@xcite that are related by single spin flips . by comparing the gss",
    "thus obtained many flexible bonds can be detected .",
    "note that this procedure gives no information about rigid bonds , because these must keep their condition in _ all _ gss .",
    "although the speedup given by this procedure is important , the number of gss required to obtain the rl remains of the order of @xmath16 .    for the procedure presented above",
    "we have assumed the existence of an algorithm that can find any gs configuration of the systems involved .",
    "but for some systems , if the sample size is not very small , only probabilistic algorithms are available , i.e. algorithms whose output is a gs configuration with a probability smaller than @xmath28 . in this case",
    "the only modification of the rlsa is that , in step 5 , a bond is classified as rigid if in @xmath29 independent runs of the probabilistic algorithm the condition @xmath30 is obtained .",
    "note that , as in this case flexible bonds are always correctly classified , the true rl is a subset of the rl calculated with our algorithm . for lattices with ppbc we implemented the rlsa using parallel tempering monte carlo .",
    "@xcite recently , we have shown that this technique is a powerful heuristic method for reaching the gs of the eab model up to @xmath31 in 2d and @xmath32 in 3d . @xcite",
    "as in the rlsa many independent runs of parallel tempering are needed , we have obtained the rl of samples up to @xmath33 in 2d and @xmath34 in 3d .",
    "parameters used here are the same as in ref .   and",
    "@xmath35 independent runs were carried out in all the cases .    for 2d lattices with pfbc it is well known that the problem of finding the gs can be mapped to a minimum - weighted perfect matching problem , which can be solved exactly in polynomial time ( i.e in time proportional to some power of @xmath4).@xcite we have used one implementation of the blossom algorithm , @xcite which has allowed us to obtain the gs of systems with sizes up to @xmath36 . to obtain the rl",
    ", however , we have not used the rlsa , because systems with frozen spins can not be mapped to perfect matching problems .",
    "then , we have implemented an equivalent algorithm that it is roughly as follows :    1 .   a gs configuration @xmath17 of the system is calculated and its energy @xmath18 is stored .",
    "all bonds are listed as unclassified .",
    "2 .   an unclassified bond @xmath19 is chosen .",
    "if bond @xmath19 is satisfied , we do @xmath37 , and if it is frustrated , we do @xmath38 .",
    "note that this increases the energy of the configurations where the bond is in the same condition as in @xmath17 , and decreases the energies of the rest .",
    "the gs is calculated for the modified system and its energy @xmath25 stored .",
    "if @xmath39 , bond @xmath19 is classified as flexible , else it is classified as rigid .",
    "steps 2 to 5 are repeated until all the bonds have been classified .",
    "the procedure , implemented with the blossom algorithm , has allowed us to obtain the rl of samples with system sizes up to @xmath40 .",
    "this algorithm is based on the following reasoning .",
    "if we want to find the rigidity of bond @xmath19 , the set of all @xmath41 possible spin configurations can be split into two subsets : set @xmath42 , containing all the configurations where this bond is frustrated , and set @xmath43 , containing all configurations where this bond is satisfied .",
    "the energy of the lowest configurations within each set are denoted @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "let us suppose now that the gs configuration @xmath17 of the system ( with energy @xmath18 ) belongs to set @xmath42 and @xmath46 .",
    "then , we modify the bond @xmath19 in such a way ( see below ) that for all configurations of @xmath42 the energy is raised by the same quantity @xmath47 . thus , the lowest energy configurations of this set are the same as in the original system , but with energy @xmath48 . in turn",
    ", the lowest energy of the configurations belonging to set @xmath43 is lowered by the amount @xmath47 , i. e. @xmath49 .",
    "now , if bond @xmath19 is flexible , we have @xmath50 and therefore the gs energy of the modified system will satisfy @xmath51 . on the other hand ,",
    "if bond @xmath19 is rigid , we have @xmath52 . in this case , the new gs energy is either @xmath53 or @xmath54 . but note that in any of these cases , we have @xmath55 .",
    "thus , to know whether a bond is rigid or not it is enough to check if the gs energy of the modified system satisfies @xmath56 ( flexible bond ) or @xmath55 ( rigid bond ) .    if the gs configuration @xmath17 belongs to set @xmath43 , the preceding reasoning is exactly the same .",
    "the only feature that depends on whether the gs configuration belongs to set @xmath43 or @xmath42 , is the modification of the bond to produce a new system with an associated value of @xmath47 .",
    "note , however , that the method works for any value of @xmath47 .",
    "the values we have chosen are as follows : if the gs configuration belongs to set @xmath42 we do @xmath38 , resulting in @xmath57 , whereas if the gs configuration belongs to set @xmath43 we do @xmath37 , resulting in @xmath58 . as the smallest energy gap between consecutive levels is @xmath59 , these choices of @xmath47 guarantee that if the bond is rigid then the new gs energy will be larger than or equal to the gs energy of the original system , and if it is flexible it will be strictly smaller .",
    "thus , as stated in step 5 of the algorithm above , a comparison between the gs energies of the modified and original systems is enough to determine whether the bond is flexible or not .",
    "in this section we present the main topological characteristics of the backbone for 2d and 3d lattices .",
    "first , we analyze the distribution of backbone sizes and , by extrapolating , we calculate the fraction of rigid bonds and s spins in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "next , the percolation process displayed for finite lattice sizes is studied in detail to infer the structure of the backbone of macroscopic samples .",
    "we conclude by showing the behavior of the contributions of the rl and fl to the mean energy per bond .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) a 2d sample of @xmath12 with ppbc .",
    "( b ) the corresponding rl formed by four islands .",
    "symbols are as in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the spin denoted by a star is solidary with the set of spins contained inside the closed dash line .",
    "( c - f ) partial rls for the four legs in which are broken all configurations of the gs . ]",
    "as mentioned above , the backbone can be characterized by the set of s spins which preserve their relative orientations in all configurations of the gs .",
    "it is evident that the spins joined by bonds of the rl are s spins .",
    "but , remarkably , there are samples where some solidary spins are `` isolated '' , in the sense that they are not connected to the rl . to see how this is possible ,",
    "let us consider the sample shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( a ) .",
    "we have obtained its rl , as well as the set of all solidary spins , by exploring all the gss of the system , using a branch - and - bound algorithm .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] ( b ) shows that the rl is composed by four islands .",
    "one of the solidary spins , denoted by a star in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( b ) , is outside of rl . as mentioned in the preceding section , the set of gs configurations",
    "can be divided in several disjoint subsets called legs .",
    "a leg is defined by the requirement that their configurations are connected by paths of single spin - flips . within each leg , the bonds that do not change their status form a `` partial '' rl .",
    "the intersection of the partial rigid lattices gives rise to the `` global '' rl .",
    "[ figure2 ] shows the partial rl of the four possible legs for that sample .",
    "note that the spin denoted with a star belongs to the four partial rl .",
    "in other words , it is connected by four different paths to the global rl island identified with a dashed line , and is therefore `` solidary '' with it .",
    "fortunately , analyzing many samples up to sizes of @xmath12 in 2d and @xmath60 in 3d , we have concluded that the situation exemplified in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] is very rare and should not be significant for larger lattice sizes : only @xmath61 and @xmath62 of samples in , respectively , 2d and 3d lattices have isolated solidary spins ( and less than 5 of these spins in each case ) , and we have not found indications that these percentages increase with increasing @xmath4 . therefore , in the following we consider as s spins only those that are linked by the rl .",
    "this is necessary because our rlsa can only find sets of rigid bonds .",
    "in a recent work , a bond - diluted version of the 3d eab has been studied close to the bond percolation threshold of the lattice .",
    "@xcite the critical density of non - zero bonds separating the paramagnetic from the sg phase in the gs , was determined by analyzing the correlation function between two external spins put in both ends of the sample . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the authors find that these external spins are perfectly correlated ( solidary ) up to the critical density .",
    "in other words , they change from solidary to non - solidary at the sg threshold . from this work",
    ", however , it is difficult to infer whether the rl also percolates at the same critical density . nevertheless , if the rl percolation threshold is lower , the mechanism shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] would provide an explanation of why the externals spins keep solidary in absence of a percolating rigid structure .",
    "it could thus play an important role in this kind of systems .      for the 2d eab model with ppbc",

    "this model has a ferromagnetic phase for low concentrations up to @xmath232 and @xmath233 in 2d and 3d , respectively .",
    "@xcite note that these concentrations are larger ( almost by a factor of @xmath1 ) than the ones we have found for the rl both in 2d and 3d .",
    "this suggests that the backbone could be considered as a ferromagnetic component embedded in the spin glass .",
    "this analogy , however , is not complete because in the transformed structure the antiferromagnetic bonds can not be necessarily considered as random , since the frustrated bonds of the rl are correlated . furthermore , for this analogy to be meaningful , the rl should be a percolating structure .",
    "thus , the analogy is better for 3d than for 2d systems , where we have shown that there is no solid evidence of percolation .",
    "in this section we use the results obtained in this and previous works , to try to understand the role that the backbone plays in the behavior of some spin glass systems , and in general in disordered and frustrated systems .    because of the fact that the determination of the gs of the eab model is an np - hard problem , in this work all numerical studies",
    "were restricted to relatively small samples .",
    "nevertheless , the results obtained suggest that whereas in 2d there is no evidence that the rl percolates , in 3d percolation of the rl seems to be the most probable scenario . taking into account the fact that in 2d the critical temperature is vanishing whereas for 3d it is known that @xmath234 , it can be conjectured that the properties of the low temperature phase must be strongly correlated with the properties of the backbone ( characterized by the rl , in this work ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of frustration found in eab systems is also very interesting .",
    "we have observed that frustration is not homogeneously distributed in the system : it is mostly concentrated in the fl , whose energy per bond @xmath207 is thus much larger than the corresponding energy of the rl , @xmath206 .",
    "moreover , figs .",
    "[ figure17 ] and [ figure18 ] show that @xmath207 has a minimum value for nonvanishing @xmath211 and that in 3d at @xmath209 it takes a value that is close to the energies of the whole system in the paramagnetic phase ( in the 2d case the value coincides with the energy of the system for @xmath235 ) .",
    "this suggests that the fl can be thought as a subsystem in an excited state .",
    "@xcite this impression is supported by the fact that , when considered as an isolated system , the gs energy of the fl is smaller than @xmath207 .",
    "furthermore , this also suggests that the behavior of the fl is closely related to that of a paramagnet , even at vanishing temperatures .",
    "when compared with the ferromagnetic phase of the random bond ising model at low concentrations of antiferromagnetic bonds , the low frustration that we find in the rl seems to indicate that the rl could share many of the properties of a ferromagnet ( even though in 3d there is no spontaneous magnetization of the backbone , for @xmath236 , the clusters of s spins align in one of two possible directions ) .",
    "it must be said , however , that this is only a conjecture , because , as mentioned in the previous section , one can not be sure that the gauge transformation maps a typical distribution of frustrated bonds to a typical distribution of random bonds in the random bond ising model , because of the correlations that arise between frustrated bonds of the rl .",
    "recently , the fact that the rl and the fl have very different properties has also been verified in other contexts .",
    "@xcite for instance , the size dependence of the defect energy in 3d shows that the rl has a very large stability ( stiffness exponent @xmath237 ) , comparable with that of a ferromagnet ( stiffness exponent @xmath238 for the ising model in 3d ) .",
    "this large stability must also be compared to the stability of the system as a whole , which is much lower ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "@xcite this arises as a compensation between the large stability of the rl and the instability of the fl .",
    "the relevance of the separation of the system in rl and fl can also be appreciated in the out of equilibrium dynamics .",
    "it has been observed that the distribution of spin mean flipping times has two peaks , corresponding to groups of fast and slow spins.@xcite but a detailed analysis of the contributions of the rl and fl reveals that most of the slow spins belong to the rl and most of the fast spins belong to the fl .",
    "@xcite    further evidence of the different roles that the rl and fl play in the physics of the system is obtained in the study of the violation of the fdt.@xcite whereas inside the rl a coarsening - like behavior is observed , the fl asymptotically follows the fdt ( a behavior characteristic of a paramagnetic phase ) .",
    "all these results support the idea that in the eab model the system can be divided into two regions that have very different properties : one behaves mostly like a ferromagnet ( rl ) whereas the other behaves more like a paramagnet ( fl ) .",
    "evidently , the characterization of the backbone given in this and other works can only be applied to systems having a degenerate gs .",
    "but , in general , systems with a continuous distribution of bonds have at most one gs ( or two if we allow a global spin flip ) , where the rl would encompass the whole system . to extend the notion of backbone to such systems a more general definition of rigidity",
    "should be given .",
    "in particular the ` rigidity ' of each bond should be associated to a parameter taking a continuum of values , instead of only two ( rigid - flexible ) as in the eab .",
    "one possible generalization is as follows . for a bond @xmath19",
    "we define its rigidity @xmath240 , where @xmath18 is the gs energy of the sample and @xmath241 is the lowest energy for which the condition of the bond @xmath19 is frustrated ( satisfied ) if it is satisfied ( frustrated ) in the gs .",
    "as shown below , this seems to be a very reasonable generalization . the algorithm to find",
    "the rigidity of each bond is very similar to the rlsa : after finding the gs of the system , one of the spins @xmath22 and @xmath23 is flipped , and then both are ` frozen ' and the lowest energy of the constrained system is calculated .",
    "this gives @xmath241 , the energy of the lowest excited state where the bond @xmath19 is in a different condition than in the gs .",
    "we have performed a preliminary study of the distribution of rigidities for different bond distributions in the edwards - anderson model ( a more complete analysis will be presented elsewhere ) .",
    "first , note that in the 3d eab model the rigidity @xmath242 can only take 4 values : 0 ( bonds that belong to the fl ) , 4 , 8 or 12 ( bonds belonging to the rl ) . in 2d bonds in the rl can only have @xmath243 or @xmath244 .",
    "figure  [ figure20 ] ( a ) shows the distribution of these values for 3d samples with @xmath114 , for which the average rigidity is @xmath245 .    figure  [ figure20 ] ( a ) shows that the concept of rigidity allows us to detect the heterogeneity inside of the rl . nevertheless , it is interesting to notice that also the fl is not a homogeneous lattice .",
    "in fact , a flexible bond which changes its condition ( satisfied or frustrated ) in only a few gs configurations is expected to have a more rigid behavior than flexible bonds that changed in many gs configurations .",
    "a study of the heterogeneous character of the fl could be carried out by uniform sampling of the gs using , for example , the algorithm proposed in ref .  .",

    "the inset shows a map plot of the probability that a bond of strength @xmath257 has a rigidity @xmath242 .",
    "darker levels of gray indicate larger probabilities .",
    ", width=264 ]    on the other hand , we argue that the rigidity of bond @xmath19 is a quantity that can give an idea of the ` effective interaction ' between spins @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in systems with quenched disorder , as the 3d eab . this conjecture is supported by the fact that in the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of this system it is observed @xcite that non solidary spins flip as if they were embedded in a paramagnetic phase , which indicates that the effective interaction between them is very small . for solidary spins , on the other hand , the effective interaction seems to be much stronger because they flip much less often .",
    "even though the numerical results described in this paper were obtained for the eab model , the generalization advanced in the previous paragraphs seems to indicate that the concept of backbone can be used in other disordered and frustrated systems .",
    "this structure could be obtained by thoroughly studying and comparing the configurations of the fundamental state as well as of the first excited levels .",
    "as mentioned before , we think that the idea of separately studying the contribution of the backbone to the different physical quantities of a system could be very useful for a better understanding of the low temperature phase of spin glasses .",
    "in particular , it could shine some light on the long standing controversy between the droplet picture and the rsb picture .",
    "the droplet picture postulates that below the critical temperature a spin glass is essentially like a ferromagnet , in the sense that it should have a trivial energy landscape .",
    "if this picture was correct , it could be thought that what is happening is that the backbone ( which , as we have shown , can be considered as analogous to a ferromagnet ) is dominating the physics of the system , at very low temperatures .",
    "also , for the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the edwards - anderson model the rsb picture predicts a continuous violation of the fdt , associated to the existence of many ergodic components .",
    "@xcite evidences of this have been found not only in numerical simulations of the 3d eab model @xcite but also in recent experiments,@xcite which lends strong support for the rsb picture .",
    "but it has also been found @xcite that when the system is separated into rl and fl the physical behavior of these components is very different from the one observed for the whole system .",
    "the fl curve is in perfect agreement with the fdt ( as happens for a paramagnet ) whereas for the rl the behavior found is similar to a coarsening process , which is typical of ferromagnetic materials .",
    "it is the combination of these two behaviors that gives rise to a violation of the fdt similar to what is predicted by the rsb picture .",
    "it must be said that the idea that there is a special component of the system that is responsible for the singular behavior of spin glasses at low temperature is not new .",
    "@xcite in particular , an intuitive picture , based on the existence of ferromagnetic clusters , has been proposed to explain several experimental results .",
    "@xcite it postulates that the size of the clusters is inversely proportional to the temperature .",
    "more specifically , it assumes that the ferromagnetic clusters are composed by those spins joins by bonds that satisfy @xmath259 . as a consequence",
    ", there appears a critical temperature at which the largest cluster percolates , resulting in the divergence of a correlation length .",
    "this picture , however , is essentially different to the one we propose in this paper . in our case ,",
    "the ferromagnetic - like clusters which form the backbone are only weakly related to the strength of its bonds , and depend instead on the structure of the gs and the first excited levels of the system .",
    "another important difference is that the clusters are not independent , because there is an effective interaction between them , given by their embedding in a structure analogous to an excited phase .",
    "in this work we have carried out a detailed analysis of the properties and topology of the backbone of the edwards - anderson model with a bimodal distribution of bonds .",
    "the backbone is characterized by the rl , the structure formed by the bonds that do not change their condition in the different gs configurations of the system , and by the s spins , the set of spins which maintain the same relative orientation in these same configurations .",
    "we find that whereas in the thermodynamic limit there is a strong evidence that the backbone percolates in 3d , in 2d our results indicate that the most probable scenario is that this structure does not percolate .",
    "the results are consistent with the fact that only for the 3d eab there is a positive critical temperature .",
    "we also find that the frustration present in the rl is much smaller than the frustration of its complement , the fl .",
    "this leads to the conjecture that , at least at low enough temperatures , the rl and the fl could share many of the properties of a ferromagnet and a paramagnet , respectively .",
    "this conjecture has also been suggested in other contexts .",
    "@xcite    in this paper the concept of rl is crucially dependent on the degeneracy of the gs of the system , and therefore applies only to models where the bonds can take only discrete values .",
    "however , as mentioned in the previous section , the idea of the separation of the system into two components with very different properties can be generalized to system with continuous distribution of bonds .",
    "we argue that the study of the separate contribution of these components to the different observables could lead to a deeper understanding of the low temperature phase of disordered and frustrated systems . in this sense",
    ", further work is being carried out to understand the properties of the backbone of continuous systems , as well as its influence on the probability distribution functions of the spin and link overlap and on the emergence of rare clusters in the paramagnetic phase of spin glasses ( griffiths singularities ) .",
