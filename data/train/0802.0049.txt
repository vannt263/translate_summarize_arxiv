    "in the standard model ( sm ) with massless neutrinos , lepton flavour is conserved .",
    "however , the current neutrino oscillation data indicate non  degenerate neutrinos with large mixing angles  @xcite , and this , in turn , implies lepton  flavour violation ( lfv ) within the sm extended to include massive neutrinos .",
    "this flavour violation is large in the neutrino sector ( where the pontecorvo  maki  nakagawa ",
    "sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix has large off  diagonal entries , unlike the cabbibo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix of the quark sector ) , but very small in the charged  lepton sector , with branching ratios for lfv decays suppressed by factors of @xmath9  @xcite , and thus well below current and future experimental limits .",
    "hence , any experimental signal of charged  lepton  flavour violation would be a clear indication of physics beyond the sm .",
    "while current bounds from non  collider experiments strongly constrain @xmath10 transitions , the limits on @xmath11 and @xmath12 conversion are much less stringent  @xcite . moreover , as we shall discuss in detail below , many extensions of the sm predict lfv in @xmath13 decays at a rate accessible at future @xmath14 and hadron colliders .    in this article",
    "we focus on the decay @xmath15 which should provide a clean signature to observe lfv at the large hadron collider lhc  @xcite .",
    "linear collider  @xcite and at muon or neutrino factories  @xcite . ] in general , the decay @xmath16 would have similar characteristics , though in many models ( including several of the models we consider ) , the couplings to electrons are suppressed relative to the couplings to muons .",
    "moreover , muons provide a far cleaner signal than electrons in a hadron collider environment  @xcite . at the lhc ,",
    "@xmath13 leptons are produced predominantly from decays of @xmath17 and @xmath18 mesons and @xmath19 and @xmath20 bosons . in the low ",
    "luminosity phase , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath21  fb@xmath22 per year , one expects approximately @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xmath13 leptons produced per year from heavy meson and weak boson decays , respectively .",
    "the @xmath13 leptons from heavy meson decays result in a much softer muon transverse momentum spectrum and are more difficult to trigger and analyze . therefore ,",
    "in our monte carlo studies we only include @xmath13 leptons from @xmath19 and @xmath20 boson decays . with standard",
    "acceptance cuts ( @xmath25 and @xmath26  gev ) , and requiring either two muons with @xmath27  gev or a single muon with @xmath28  gev for trigger purposes , we find acceptances for various bsm models of approximately @xmath29@xmath30 .",
    "thus , even restricting ourselves to @xmath13 leptons from weak boson decays only , and assuming a branching ratio close to the current upper limit @xmath31",
    "@xcite , we can expect approximately @xmath32 @xmath15  events within the acceptance range of a typical lhc general purpose detector after one year of low ",
    "luminosity running . with @xmath33",
    "fb@xmath22 of data , it should be possible to probe branching ratios down to a level of @xmath34  @xcite at the lhc .",
    "[ recent results from @xmath17 factories also begin to test branching ratios down to the level of @xmath35  @xcite ; a prospective super  b facility  @xcite could probe branching ratios of @xmath36 . ]",
    "note that there is an even tighter experimental limit on the radiative lfv decay @xmath37 , with an upper bound on the branching ratio of @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "the radiative decay itself is difficult to detect at the lhc  @xcite , and any model that allows the decay @xmath15  to proceed through an effective @xmath39 vertex only is already constrained by this bound , and will be further suppressed by a factor of @xmath40 from the @xmath41 vertex .",
    "however , models where the lfv @xmath13 decay can be mediated by the exchange of new heavy particles escape the tight bound on radiative transitions . with this in mind",
    ", we will only investigate models of this type , though we will briefly comment on other models afterwards .",
    "there are many observables associated with the decay @xmath15 .",
    "since we are focusing on models where the virtual particles have large masses @xmath42 , the propagators are replaced by @xmath43 , and the obvious difference between models is the chiral structure of the effective vertices .",
    "we choose the angle @xmath44 to be the angle between the polarization of the @xmath13 lepton  and the momentum of the anti  muon ( assuming @xmath45 ) and differentiate models according to their partial decay width in @xmath46 , having integrated over all other kinematic variables .",
    "approximately @xmath47 of the @xmath13 leptons  from electroweak gauge bosons will be produced in @xmath19 decays , which result in characteristic spin patterns .",
    "for example , the decay @xmath48 produces @xmath13 leptons  with left  handed helicity only , so that the polarization vector is antiparallel to the momentum vector and can thus be determined experimentally .",
    "we note that the polarization of @xmath13 leptons  from @xmath18 and @xmath17 mesons or from @xmath20 decays can not be determined in such simple manner .",
    "the @xmath13 leptons  from these sources should thus not be included in our polarization analysis , but instead dilute the signal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we will present analytic expressions for the matrix element and differential decay width derived from an effective lagrangian with the most general four  fermion @xmath49 interactions that do not involve derivatives .",
    "the result of this calculation has been used in a monte carlo study to estimate the detector acceptance for various new physics models . in order to show how",
    "the decay angular distribution can be employed to discriminate between different models we provide specific predictions for various supersymmetric , little higgs and technicolour models , and models with doubly charged higgs bosons . in each case",
    ", we will briefly describe the relevant features of the model , extract the values for the effective parameters of the general matrix element and differential decay width expressions , present the dependence of its partial decay width with respect to @xmath46  and the acceptance for the decay simulated in a typical lhc general purpose detector with the experimental cuts described above .",
    "finally , we will briefly discuss three additional classes of models : those that fit the criterion of heavy mediating particles , but have no concrete predictions for the dependence on @xmath46 , those which are very constrained by the @xmath37  data , and unparticle models .",
    "we consider an interaction using effective four  fermion vertices .",
