    "it was demonstrated @xcite , that dp elastic scattering at @xmath1 and inclusive ( d , p ) breakup with the proton registered at @xmath2 are deeply connected .",
    "for example , the relativistic one - neutron - exchange mechanism of figure 1a describes well energy dependence of differential cross section of the dp elastic scattering if empirical effective momentum distribution of the proton in the deuteron , extracted from exclusive ( d , p ) reaction data , is used .",
    "the details of extraction procedure from excluisive data , as well as comparison of the momentum distributions in the deuteron , extracted from different reactions reactions see in refs.@xcite .",
    "still , there are significant differences for spin - dependent observables in these two reactions .",
    "the mechanism , similar to the one - neutron - exchange , was also assumed to be a basic one for proton  lightest - nuclei backward scattering @xcite . in this case the colliding proton and nuclei are exchanged by a group of @xmath3 nucleons , where @xmath4 - is the atomic number .",
    "for example , the simplest reaction of such kind , @xmath5 backward elastic scattering , the two nucleon mechanism of figure  1b should be dominant . indeed it was shown , that in the framework of the dynamics at light cone and making use of the empirical momentum distributions of the proton and the deuteron in the @xmath6 @xcite one describes well the published experimental data @xcite for cross section of this reaction @xcite . besides the two nucleon exchange mechanism of figure  1b some other mechanisms were also discussed in the literature ( see @xcite and refs . there ) .",
    "for example a @xmath7-component of the @xmath6 wave function was shown to be of a great importance besides a @xmath8-component .    in turn",
    "it was argued that in @xmath9 backward elastic scattering the main reaction mechanism is connected with the one - nucleon - exchange ( one ) of figure  1c and only the @xmath7-component should contribute @xcite . the first data on differential cross section , @xmath10 , and tensor analyzing power , @xmath11 , were recently measured at riken at @xmath12140 ,  200 and 270  mev @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study how the @xmath9 backward elastic scattering is connected with exclusive @xmath13 reaction thorough the one mechanism and make estimation for the differential cross section at higher energy . between possible reaction mechanisms beyond the one we draw attention to that with elastic deuteron - deuteron rescattering ( dds ) of figure  1d . due to identity of the deuterons",
    "the dd elastic backward scattering is the same as the forward one and the contribution of this diagram should have the same energy dependence as that of one .",
    "similar mechanism for the pd backward scattering was already considered in @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite we will use so - called `` minimal relativization '' scheme of the relativistic dynamics at infinite momentum frame ( imf ) for the @xmath0he wave function .",
    "this is done by introducing internal momentum between the deuteron and the proton in the @xmath0he and substituting this momentum in the nonrelativistic @xmath0he wave function . for our purposes",
    "it is enough to consider the d+p chanel of the @xmath0he wave function .    defining the imf internal momentum , @xmath14",
    ", we follow to our analysis of the @xmath15 breakup published in ref.@xcite .",
    "first one can define a fraction of the @xmath0he momentum carried in by the deuteron in the imf in longitudial direction @xmath16 where @xmath0he and deuteron momenta are assumed to be @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "one can introduce invariant mass of virtual d+p pair @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the deuteron and proton mass .",
    "for simplicity we will put @xmath22 . in terms of the invariant mass @xmath23",
    "the internal momentum is defined to be @xmath24 in ( [ k ] ) @xmath25 .",
    "the signs `` + '' and `` - '' are chosen for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "similar to the deuteron ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) one can connect the d+p - channel wave function of the @xmath0he , @xmath28 , with @xmath0he@xmath29dp vertex function , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are magnetic quantum numbers for the @xmath0he , the deuteron , the proton and orbital motion and @xmath35 is the @xmath0he mass . in turn the d+p - channel wave function of the @xmath0he",
    "can be written in terms of s and d wave components @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38 in the framework of the dynamics in imf the wave function ( [ wf ] ) is assumed to be normalized as @xmath39 where @xmath40",
    "according to the perturbation theory in imf one gets the following expression for the matrix element in the one approximation : @xmath41 where 2 is the combinatorial factor due to bose statistics for deuterons and @xmath42 is the spectroscopic factor in the @xmath0he .",
    "using the connection between the wave function and the vertex function ( [ vertex ] ) one can rewrite eq.([matrix_el ] ) in terms of the wave function ( [ wf ] ) @xmath43 simple calculations now give the following expression for the differential cross section of the 180@xmath44 elastic d+@xmath0he scattering : @xmath45 ^ 2 n^2_d(k ) , \\label{cs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the total energy of colliding particles in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "now we will estimate the dds of figure 1d .",
    "omitting the real part of the dd elastic cross section at zero angle one gets that appropriate amplitude will be pure imaginary . because the one amplitude is pure real one concludes that interference between these mechanisms must be small : @xmath47 in turn the @xmath48-scattering cross section is given by @xmath49 ^ 2 , \\label{dds-2}\\ ] ] where the formfactor @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 in ( [ dds-3 ] ) @xmath52 is radial wave function of the d+p configuration in the @xmath0he with orbital quantum number @xmath53 and q is deuteron transferred momentum .",
    "in our calculations we use momentum distribution of deuterons in the @xmath0he extracted in framework of impulse approximation from @xmath54 breakup data at zero angle @xcite . for spectroscopic number we use @xmath55 .    to estimate contribution of",
    "the dds we have to evaluate amplitude of elastic dd - scattering at @xmath56 and expressed it as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are deuteron momentum and total energy of the dd - scattering in its center of mass frame . as a total dd cross section we use @xmath60  mb .",
    "results of our calculation are compared with riken data at figure  2 .",
    "one sees that the dds mechanism is not significant at this energy scale . in turn , as displayed at figure  3 it becomes comparable with the one at @xmath611  gev .",
    "* in the preset calculations we use maximal spectroscopic number @xmath55 .",
    "but three - body calculations with realistic nn - potential give value @xmath62 ( for example for argon potential it was obtained @xmath63 @xcite ) .",
    "* we have estimated dds in the framework of nonrelativistic calculations , but relativistic effect are seem to be as important in it , as in the one .",
    "* we have used very naive assumptions about the amplitude of the elastic dd - scattering .",
    "more realistic amplitude should be critical for polarization observables .",
    "* in the calculations presented here the `` small components '' of the @xmath15 wave function were neglected .",
