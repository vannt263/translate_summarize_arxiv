    "the idea of framization of a knot algebra ( hecke algebras and bmw  algebra among others ) was introduced by the two last authors in @xcite and consists in adding framing generators to the defining generators of the knot algebra with the aim of finding new invariants of classical links or , more generally , invariants of knot - like objects . the yokonuma ",

    "then , the third author studied the jones recipe by using the hecke algebra of type @xmath0 ; namely , in @xcite she constructed the analogue of the homflypt polynomial for oriented knots and links inside the solid torus , see also @xcite .",
    "further , in @xcite lambropoulou constructed all possible analogues of the homflypt polynomial in the solid torus from the ariki - koike algebras and the affine hecke algebras of type @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to introduce and to start a systematic study of a framization of the hecke algebras of type @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath3 , with the principal objective to explore their usefulness in knot theory .",
