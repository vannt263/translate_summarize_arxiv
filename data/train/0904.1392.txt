    "since the launch of the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ; * ? ? ?",

    "uv data are of primary interest for studying star formation over timescales of about 100 myrs , and low redshift uv data are useful to interpret similar high redshift data .",
    "the galex measurements themselves , however , do not provide enough information for most studies due to the lack of angular resolution and narrow spectral coverage , which do not allow for a reliable star  galaxy separation .",
    "the single color of the two bands is also a serious restriction on the potential applications .",
    "the solution is to cross - identify the galex sources to other catalogs , in particular to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",

    "are observed many times . in the scientific analyses one would like to work with clean catalogs that list every source only once .",
    "if multiple detections of the same sources contaminate the dataset , the results would be biased , and the measurements useless . while it might be tempting to resolve this issue by selecting the best quality observations , e.g. , maximizing signal - to - noise ratio , this a posteriori selection would create a statistical bias in the overlapping parts . thus the preferred way to do the primary  secondary assignment is based on prior from the survey s geometry . only the resolution based on the geometry",
    "guarantees that we can maintain a good understanding of the effective depth that often varies on the sky .",
    "the statistical studies we are most concerned with typically rely on the ais and mis datasets that both follow a common observational strategy ; namely , the field centers are targeting pre - defined positions on the sky that we call the skygrid . in other words ,",
    "every given mis or ais field was positioned such that its center aims at one of the pre - defined locations on the sky .",
    "this icosahedron - based tiling algorithm is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the skygrid consists of 47,612 points on the celestial sphere that in turn define disjoint cells on the sky in the following sense : any point on the celestial sphere can be assigned to a single skygrid position by picking the closest of them all .",
    "the contiguous region where all points belong to the same grid point is a skygrid cell .",
    "these cells are all disjoint and their union is the entire sky .",
    "this process of subdivision is called the @xcite tessellation , and these cells defined by the skygrid centers are a particular tessellation of the sky .",
    "if any given point is inside one and only one of the skygrid cells then we can use this information to resolve the problem of multiple detections of sources .",
    "the idea is that when a source is seen in multiple fields , one is to take the detection that is inside the skygrid cell that belongs to its own field .",
    "these objects we call _ primaries _ and all the other detections are the _ secondaries_. of course , every secondary is going to be a primary in some other neighboring field  assuming the field is observed and actually covers that region .",
    "this also means that every field has a primary region and a secondary part , and their shapes can be defined mathematically , see later in   [ sec : footprint ] .",
    "it also happens that primaries are typically toward the center of the field , where the astrometric and photometric measurements are most reliable , and secondaries tend to be on the outskirts of the field of view .",
    "this scheme has a number of advantages compared to other strategies .",
    "for example , it is straightforward to add new observations to existing catalogs without changing the existing data and their primary vs.  secondary designations . figure  [ fig : primary ] illustrates the positions of the primary and secondary sources in a few mis galex fields .",
    "the hexagon - like shapes are typical for the primary regions .",
    "the important thing to note is that by separating the objects into primaries and secondaries , we create two sets of detections , where the former ( middle panel ) consists of the better quality observations and has a well understood selection function , and the latter ( right panel ) contains all the rest . despite the complicated nature of the secondaries , they are still invaluable for various science studies , where multiple observations of the same objects are desired , e.g. , variability analyses .",

    "although these are very rare and are not intentionally part of the data releases , both ais and mis contain examples by accident . our solution is to include only the longest exposure - time field per cell and reflect this in the primary flag of all sources in the other fields ; see details in ",
    "[ sec : workprim ] .",
    "primaries make up roughly 65% of the ais or mis detections .",
    "all numbers quoted regarding these two surveys hereafter refer to primary sources , unless stated otherwise .",
    "we do not define the primary resolution for other surveys , as they do not follow the same ( or any ) systematic pattern on the sky .",
    "the galex photometric pipeline not only produces the calibrated images but also builds models for potential artifacts based on the pointing of the telescope and other variables .",
    "these models are represented as _ flagmap _",
    "images whose values describe the potential issue at that particular pixel position .",
    "table  [ table_mask ] describes the four separate layers that the different flag values indicate .",
    "we use these maps to censor our datasets , and mask out the artifacts .",
    "our approach is again a geometrical one in order to maintain a clear understanding of the angular selection function .",
    "we use the @xcite percolation algorithm to identify the clusters of contiguous pixels in the flagged regions , and these islands are then grown by a pixel to ensure that the final representation of the boundary encloses the original shape .",

    "* ) in hand , we then convert the enclosing pixel polygon into a spherical region that describes the censored area on the celestial sphere .",
    "we call these _ masks_.    the artifact flags are also stored for all detections and for both bands ; the properties are called ` fuv_artifact ` and ` nuv_artifact ` consistently in all data release products including the fits files and the database servers .      it is absolutely vital to have a precise geometric representation of the surveys sky coverage , and our primary designation is a great first step in establishing the formal description of the exact footprint",
    ". the hexagon - like cells of the primaries are simple spherical polygons described by a half dozen ( r.a . ,",
    "dec ) points .",
    "the union of all these polygons is a good first approximation of the sky coverage , but not good enough .",
    "so far , we have not used anywhere the information where the telescope was actually pointing when the field was observed , only what cell the survey was targeting with that exposure . in an ideal world",
    "these two would be the same , but in practice they are not and sometimes the offsets are quite significant .",
    "we need to include an additional constraint on top of the primary cell definition that describes the field of view . for galex ,",
    "this is a circle around the true field center ( ` avaspra ` , ` avaspdec ` ) with a nominal field radius of 36 or could be a more conservative 30 threshold . in figure",
    "[ fig : zoom ] we show the mis and ais ( primary ) coverage in a randomly chosen small patch of the sky using a stereographic projection centered on @xmath7 .",

    "note that some of the skygrid cells have partial coverage even with the 36 radius , where the pointing of the field was considerably off from the targeted position .",
    "we use a generic mathematical framework @xcite and a light - weight but high - performance spherical geometry library to express all these in a uniform way by using the halfspace , convex , region concepts detailed in @xcite . for every field ,",
    "we intersect the spherical polygon of the primary cell with the small circle constraint of the field of view , and take a union of all fields to arrive at the exact footprint description .",

    ", one needs to consider the masks ; see   [ sec : mask ] .",
    "the masks are defined per field but may very well extend beyond the limits of the primary cell .",
    "the secondary parts of the masks need not be applied on the primary catalog , so one needs to intersect the masks with the primary cells of their corresponding fields and use that to censor the sources .    the above mathematical representation of the footprint and the masks not only enables fast filtering of random and simulated source catalogs but also provides an exact ( analytic ) calculation of the area for a given polygon , which is important for essentially all statistical studies , e.g. , the normalization of luminosity functions .",

    "naturally the sources are not exactly at the same position in the two bands , hence the pipeline relies on the distance between the fuv and nuv detections and implements a hard cutoff at three arcseconds of separation , i.e. , detections that are closer than 3  are merged into a single source ( if they meet the eligibility criteria in * ? ? ?",

    "the other large component in the contingency matrices is the two - to - one matches , where there are two galex detections for every sdss source .",
    "our visual inspection of a large number of these cases unravels a peculiar fact : most of these associations , roughly 85% , have galex sources , where one out of the two is detected in the nuv only and the other in only the fuv .",
    "this suggests the possibility that all these detections are , in fact , from the same source but they were not merged in the pipeline because they were either not eligible to be merged by not meeting the signal - to - noise ratio limit , or their distances are greater than the 3 limit .",
    "we performed the cross identification of the galex sources to themselves ( excluding the identities ) with a search radius of 5 using the nominal positions , ( ` ra ` , ` dec ` ) .",
    "this limit is again motivated by the bayesian analysis , and should provide a safe margin to elect all candidates .",
    "the pairwise distance distributions of primaries are shown in figure  [ fig : pairself ] .",
    "we see a sharp break at 3 , the limit of the official band merging . at smaller separations than the break , there can be sources that were very close to the snr threshold : although they made the detection limit of sextractor , they were not eligible to be merged .",
    "these two thresholds are both roughly at around @xmath12 but not exactly the same in the two applications .",
    "alternatively these could be cases where one of the sources in the pair are already merged with some another source .",
    "we find that the latter is not the case .",
    "in fact , the whole histogram is dominated entirely by nuv / fuv only detections . below the break ,",
    "the fuv fluxes are essentially in the noise . above the 3 separation ,",
    "it is again fuv / nuv only detections of any signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "our statistics are also in accord with the visual inspection described in the previous section",
    ".    the census of the merged fuv - nuv pairs inside and beyond the official 3 separation limit can only be done systematically in a statistical way due to their large numbers .",
    "our approach is to assume that the associations are correct and study their properties , namely the uv color - magnitude diagram , to look for inconsistencies .",
    "we divide the sample into two subsets based on the separations ( greater / less than 3 ) as the two samples are expected to have different properties , and compare their distributions to a couple of reference sets .",
    "the first is the list of the merged sources produced by the galex pipeline , and the other is an artificial dataset , where one randomly shuffles the nuv - fuv associations .",
    "these two distributions are naturally quite different . if the distribution of the matched detections follows the trends seen in the pipeline data , we can be confident that they are typically good associations , and if they are more similar to the randomized dataset , they are mostly noise .",
    "figure  [ fig : colors ] shows the results of these comparisons in four panels .",
    "each panel contains an inset on the left with the color - magnitude diagram and the normalized color histogram on the right .",
    "the left panels illustrate the small separation subsample , and the right panels the pairs with large distances .",
    "the top and bottom two panels , compare these distributions to the different reference sets : pipeline on top , the randoms below .",
    "we see that the associations with smaller than 3 separations look more like the randoms , although the asymmetric shape of the color histogram suggests that there are real objects in the mixture , as well . knowing that these are very low signal - to - noise detections , this result is what one would expect . on the right",
    ", we see that on the other side of the 3 break the sources look very much like the pipeline colors .",
    "since we elected the 5 matching radius to be a safe cut , it seems odd at first that , in fact , most of these associations with these larger separations have meaningful uv colors .",
    "the implication of these results is that the astrometric precision is less accurate than the nominal @xmath13 .",
    "we find independently that the limitation of the positional accuracy is set by the low photon counts in the fuv detectors , which is being studied and will be better assessed for the upcoming data releases . in figure",
    "[ fig : astrometry ] we look at the positional differences between gr3 and dr6 primaries , using only one - to - one matches , to quantify the accuracy as a function of the nuv magnitude . for this measurement we selected a clean subsample of sdss point sources . in accord with our expectations",
    ", we see that the accuracy gets worse with the magnitude and it is often higher than 0.5 .",
    "since the colors of the associations at these larger separations out to 5 statistically prove to be physical , one can safely include large fraction of these extra merged sources that are quite significant in number .",
    "the increase in the size of the merged catalog is up to 12% for mis , and even higher , due to the lower signal - to - noise ratios , for ais up to 26% .    in figure",
    "[ fig : colors2 ] we plot the same four panels for galex associations that share a common sdss object . while the basic characteristics of the figures are essentially identical to the previous , one sees a difference in the wings of the color distributions , which are slightly tilted away from the artificial random colors . using this extra constraint promises to improve the detection limit when desired .",
    "we estimate the fraction of extra merged sources with separations larger than 3 that have similar properties than pipeline sources within the uv color magnitude - diagram . to that aim",
    ", we assume that the distribution of the extra merged sources is a linear combination of pipeline and random data . the overall fraction of extra merged sources similar to pipeline data is @xmath14 if we consider only galex associations . using the associations that share a common sdss object yields a larger fraction : @xmath15 .",
    "the results depend on magnitude , as most of the objects with pipeline - like colors are fairly faint ; for objects with 20@xmath16fuv@xmath1622 , the fraction is 0.65 ( 0.7 with sdss constraint ) ; for fainter objects , 22@xmath16fuv@xmath1624 , the fraction increases to 0.7 ( 0.8 with sdss constraint ) .",
    "understanding the galex reduction pipeline and the properties of the extracted source catalogs is crucial for working with the data .",
    "we use the galex dataset as published by the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) and augment the database with auxiliary tables and properties .",
    "the additions include tables to describe the geometry of the skygrid in form of the database table ` skygridv2 ` and the information to link the cells to the galex fields via the ` gridid ` column in the table ` photoextract ` .",
    "some of the changes had been propagated back to the official mast site but the full update is expected in early 2009 along with the new galex and sdss releases ( gr5 and dr7 ) for which this paper also serves as a guidebook and documentation .",

    "[ fig : sql - common ] we show an sql command that compares the fuv exposure times for the resulting fields .",
    "we provide the cross - identification of all galex sources to themselves .",
    "the links stored in the table ` xself ` not only enable quality assurance and diagnostic tests , but also deliver the missing merged sources at separations larger than the 3 limit in the galex pipeline out to 5 .",
    "the query in figure  [ fig : sql - nf ] emulates the pipeline merging .",
    "here one picks the pairs where one is nuv only detection ( ` band=1 ` ) and the other is fuv only ( ` band=2 ` ) and only requires the nuv detection to be primary , as it is the accepted position for the merged source in the pipeline .",
    "the galex - sdss dr6 associations are stored in the table ` xsdssdr6 ` , which again represents many - many mapping between the sources .",
    "we also introduce tables where the sources are grouped by galex and sdss identifiers and store the number of matches for each , see tables starting with ` xgroup ` .",
    "figure  [ fig : sql - join ] shows an sql query that counts the number of one - to - one matches , where both sdss and galex sources are primaries and breaks the numbers down by the sdss object classification .",
    ".... select objid , fuv_mag , nuv_mag from photoobjall o      join photoextract e on e.photoextractid = o.photoextractid where e.mpstype = ' mis '      and o.mode = 1 -- i.e. , primary      and o.band = 3 -- both bands ( 1:nuv , 2:fuv )      and o.fov_radius < 0.5 ....    with the formal description of the galex footprint in hand , it is straightforward to look for dropouts , where the sdss source is missing in galex .",
    "we achieve this by first assigning every sdss source to a skygrid cell and then selecting the cells that were actually observed in the given survey .",
    "the table ` sdssdr6inmisprimary ` contains all the sdss sources that are in the mis footprint along with the distance to the actual field center .",
    "figure  [ fig : sql - dropout ] illustrates the query where the crossmatch table is used to search for sdss galaxies close to the field center , @xmath17 , without a counterpart .",
    "we now combine the above key elements of sample selection into a real - life example of creating a catalog of primaries with detections in both bands using the extra associations discussed above , i.e. , the fuv- , nuv - only matches at larger angular separations than the official pipeline cutoff .",
    "we propagate the basic quantities of galex measurements along with links to the sdss associations , where available .",
    "figure  [ fig : sql - master ] illustrates the sql command that defines the final catalog ; the union of the three sub - queries .",
    "these are conceptually really only two : the pipeline merged sources ( ` band=3 ` ) and the one - to - one galex matches ( ` band=1 ` to ` band=2 ` ) .",
    "the third part is simply a result of the fact that the match table ` xself ` is not symmetric by construct to save storage space and is essentially identical to the previous one except for the order of the ` objid`s in the join criteria .",

    "the first query simply picks galex primaries with both bands but the anatomy of the following is more complicated : we use the aforementioned ` xself ` table to link nuv - only primaries to fuv - only sources within the same fields that are farther than 3 . note that because the we elect the nuv coordinates to be the position of the merged source following the pipeline strategy",
    ", we do not require the fuv - only source to be a primary .",

    "another approach to improve on the colors of the sources is to use a separate set of fuv fluxes from the galex pipeline : the fuv flux within the nuv aperture is also published in the catalog called _ fd - ncat _ , whose parameters are also found in the ` photoobj ` table . for the dis catalogs , where the confusion becomes an issue , there is a new algorithm being developed to use optical and/or nuv prior information on the positions .",
    "the potential problem with the _ fd - ncat _ measurements arises when the nuv and fuv positions are significantly different and the nuv aperture encloses only part of the fuv object , which yields typically smaller fuv fluxes than the actual .",
    "this could considerably affect techniques that strongly rely on the color , such as the fuv dropout selection of the _ wiggle - z _ project @xcite .",
    "we presented a detailed study of the galex photometric catalogs .",
    "our discussion focused mostly the ais and mis datasets and their properties .",

    "we also derived masks that are stored along with the sources in spherical polygons .",
    "we performed the cross - identification of the galex gr2 + 3 and sdss dr6 sources and indicated issues with multiple matches that often point toward unmerged galex detections that are only seen in the nuv and in the fuv .",
    "we found that merging these detection can be safely done out to 5 separations , which also implies that the nominal @xmath13 astrometric precision is somewhat optimistic .",

    "this new 3-way cross - matching of the sdss and the two galex bands will be done using the probabilistic formalism of @xcite , however , for this next generation analysis one will need a better understanding of the astrometry of the galex sources , especially in the fuv , where the measurements are limited by the small number of photons .",
