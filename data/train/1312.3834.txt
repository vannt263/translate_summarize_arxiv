    "for example , the set @xmath3 of nonnegative real points of @xmath1 is homeomorphic to the convex hull @xmath4 of @xmath2 through a linear projection .    if we drop algebraicity , we may associate a real irrational toric variety @xmath3 to any finite set @xmath2 of real vectors .",

    "other aspects of the dictionary between toric varieties @xmath1 and sets of integer vectors @xmath2 extend to real irrational toric varieties @xmath3 and finite sets of real vectors @xmath2  @xcite .    we further extend this dictionary .",
    "when @xmath6 , the torus @xmath7 of the ambient projective space of the toric variety @xmath1 acts on it via translations .",
    "kapranov , sturmfels , and zelevinsky  @xcite identified the closure in the hilbert scheme of the set of torus translations @xmath8 as the toric variety associated to the secondary fan of the set @xmath2 .",
    "the cones of this fan correspond to regular subdivisions of @xmath2 , which are described in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  7 ) .",
    "a consequence is that the only limiting schemes of torus translations of @xmath1 are one - parameter toric degenerations . restricting to the nonnegative part @xmath3 of @xmath1 and to positive translations @xmath9 for @xmath10",
    "gives an identification between limiting positions of positive torus translations of @xmath3 and toric degenerations of @xmath3 by cosets of one - parameter subgroups of @xmath11 .",
    "here , limiting position is measured with respect to the hausdorff metric on subsets of the nonnegative part of the projective space . in  @xcite",
    "this was used to identify all hausdorff limits of bzier patches in geometric modeling .",
    "we extend this identification between hausdorff limits of torus translates of @xmath3 and toric degenerations from the case when @xmath2 consists of integer vectors ( and thus the methods of  @xcite using algebraic geometry apply ) to the case when @xmath2 consists of any finite set of real vectors , so that methods from algebraic geometry do not apply .",
    "we do this through a direct argument , identifying all hausdorff limits of torus translations of @xmath3 with toric degenerations of @xmath3 .",

    "in particular , if a sequence of torus translates of @xmath3 has a limit in the hausdorff topology , then that limit is a toric degeneration .",
    "this shows that the space of torus translates of @xmath3 is compactified by adding the toric degenerations .",
    "real irrational toric varieties arise naturally in mathematics and its applications .",
    "they are log - linear ( toric ) models in algebraic statistics  @xcite , they were critical in the proof of the improved bound  @xcite for positive solutions to fewnomial systems , and they are a natural framework in which to understand properties of bzier patches  @xcite .",
    "toric degenerations have played a role in these last two areas . in geometric modeling , they are the possible limiting positions of a bzier patch with varying weights , giving rise to a meaningful generalization of the control polygon  @xcite .",
    "toric degenerations were a key tool to compute lower bounds on the number of real solutions  @xcite to systems of polynomial equations .",
