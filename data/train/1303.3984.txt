    "we consider two version of this problem : ( _ i _ ) the _ fractional case , _ in which we are allowed to inject a fractional amount of vaccination resources in each node of the network , and ( _ ii _ ) the _ combinatorial case , _ in which we fully vaccinate a selection of individuals in the network , leaving the rest of nodes unvaccinated .",

    "since @xmath17 is symmetric , all its eigenvalues , denoted by @xmath18 , are real .",
    "our modeling approach is based on the n - intertwined sis model proposed by van mieghem et at . in @xcite .",
    "in contrast with previously proposed models , the n - intertwined model is a continuous - time networked markov process with @xmath19 states able to model the dynamics of a viral infection in an arbitrary contact network . using the kolmogorov forward equations and a mean - field approach",
    ", one can approximate the dynamics of the viral spread using a system of @xmath1 ordinary differential equations , as follows . consider a network of @xmath1 individuals described by the adjacency matrix @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the infection probability of an individual at node @xmath21 at time @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "let us assume , for now , that the viral spreading is characterized by two positive parameters  a constant infection rate @xmath24 and a curing rate @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the n - intertwined sis model in @xcite is described by the following set of @xmath1 ode s : @xmath26 for @xmath27 .    as proved in @xcite , the exact probability of infection",

    ", we will assume that the infection rate can only take one of two values , @xmath56 .",
    "in the fractional case considered in this section , we propose an optimization framework to find the optimal distribution of resources when there is a cost function function associated to different values of @xmath31 .",
    "the cost of achieving a particular infection rate for node @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "this cost function is node - dependent and presents the following properties :    1 .",
    "the cost of achieving the natural infection rate is zero , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "the maximum cost of vaccinating node @xmath7 , denoted by @xmath59 , is achieved at the minimum infection rate , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "the vaccination cost function is monotonically decreasing in the interval @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "apart from the above properties , we make the following convexity assumptions on the cost function @xmath62 to obtain a tractable convex framework :    the vaccination cost function , @xmath57 , is twice differentiable and satisfies the following constrain : @xmath63 for @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "notice that , since @xmath62 is monotonically decreasing , we have that @xmath64 ; thus , we have that assumption 1 implies that @xmath65 .",
    "in other words , assumption 1 is stronger than convexity .",

    "we observe how the cost function is convex and presents diminishing returns , since the reduction in the infection rate for a given amount of investment is greater in the low - cost range than in the high - cost range .    )",

    "using the above lemma , we can rewrite the optimization problem [ problem : optimalvaccinedistribution ] as a convex optimization program , as follows .",

    "the convex optimization program in ( [ eq : optimalconvexvaccination ] ) allows us to efficiently find the cost - optimal allocation of vaccines to control the spread of an epidemic outbreak in a given contact network . in the following subsection",

    "we illustrate our results by designing the optimal distribution of vaccines in an online social network when the cost vaccination function follows ( [ eq : quasiconvex limit ] ) .",

    "if we had a constant infection rate @xmath99 satisfying @xmath100 , the disease - free equilibrium is unstable .",

    "in other words , our vaccine reduces the infection rate to a 20% of the natural infection rate . using these parameter values , we run three simulations , each one with a different @xmath107 .",
