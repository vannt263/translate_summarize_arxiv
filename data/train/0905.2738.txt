    "cosmological observations serve to constrain the behavior of dark energy .",
    "theoretical studies , on the other hand , should determine whether dark energy models can be distinguished by their observational consequences .",

    "it is found that different dark energy models are bounded in different sectors in the @xmath9 plane .    in this paper , on the one hand , we gather the bounds for various dark energy models in the @xmath10 plane . on the other hand , we obtain the constraints on the @xmath2 plane in the redshift region @xmath11 , by adopting a widely used parametrization  @xcite , @xmath12 , based on the current observational data .",
