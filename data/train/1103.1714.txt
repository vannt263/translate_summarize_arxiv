    "the mechanism of the high temperature superconductors ( sc s ) is an unsolved mystery in physics @xcite .",
    "high temperature sc s are layered compounds with copper - oxygen planes and are doped mott insulators with strong electronic correlations . the pairing symmetry is unconventional and there is a strong experimental evidence showing that it is largely d - wave @xcite .",
    "it is speculated that the pairing between electrons is mediated via strong anti - ferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the system .",
    "but the problem is difficult due to the strong - coupling nature of the system .",
    "although significant progress has been made in the last many years anderson , gaugetheories , alternative approaches may be valuable to tackle the problem .",
    "an interesting alternative approach is the holographic correspondence between a gravitational theory and a quantum field theory , which first emerged under the framework of ads / cft correspondence maldacena:1997re , gubser:1998bc , witten:1998qj .",
    "this method has provided us a useful and complimentary framework to describe strong interacting systems without the sign problem ( see e.g. policastro:2001yc , herzog:2006gh , liu:2006ug , gubser:2006bz , herzog:2007ij , hartnoll:2007ih , hartnoll:2007ip , hartnoll:2008hs ) . in the original top - down approach within the ads / cft framework , both the gravity side and the field theory side were precisely know in string theory and gives us much deeper insight on this correspondence .",
    "but later in bottom - up approach we assume that the correspondence exists among the different pair of theories and try to make predictions from one side of the correspondence .",
    "recently , a gravitational model of hairy black holes gubser:2005ih , gubser:2008px has been used to model s - wave high temperature sc s @xcite . in those class of models the abelian symmetry of a complex scalar field",
    "is spontaneously broken ( i.e. the higgs mechanism ) below some critical temperature .",
    "the meissner effect was soon observed by including a magnetic field in the background @xcite .",
    "a similar construction of holographic multiband superconductor has also been considered recently in @xcite .",
    "the multiband is coming from the condensation of a fundamental scalar field multiplet under non - abelian gauge group .",
    "the effect of the superconducting condensate on the holographic fermi surface has further been studied by calculating fermionic spectral functions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the properties of spectral function appeared to have similar behavior to that found in the angle resolved photo - emission experiment .",
    "analogously , holographic p - wave superconductors have also been proposed by coupling a @xmath5 yang - mills field to the black hole background , where a vector hair develops in the superconducting phase gubser:2008wv , roberts:2008ns , martin:2009plb , pallab .",
    "properties of fermionic spectral function has also been studied in p - wave superconducting background @xcite . also , there are attempts to build holographic d - wave sc s by spontaneously breaking the abelian symmetry of a charged spin two field @xcite and study different properties of the systems @xcite .",
    "in addition to the bottom up approach mentioned above , there are various top - down constructions of those condensed matter like systems by considering d - brane configurations in the ads black hole background in the string theory framework @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will be interested in studying more detailed properties of holographic d - wave superconductors using the action of benini:2010qc , benini:2010pr .",
    "the most challenging problem to construct the holographic model of d - wave sc s is that the consistent action for the charged , massive spin two field in a general curve background is still not known .",
    "although the action used in @xcite has some interesting features , such as having the right degrees of freedom and being ghost - free , it could be unstable or acausal for general gauge field configurations .",
    "it is argued that these problems may be cured by adding higher dimensional operators @xcite .    in this work , we will study properties of the holographic @xmath0 sc s based on the action of @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by the observations of spontaneous breaking of time reversal invariance in , for example , the ybco high temperature superconductor one , two , three , four , five .",
    "the time reversal breaking is thought to occur due to a complex combination of the d - wave condensates : @xmath6 .",
    "one of the possible interesting consequences of this complex d - wave condensation is that the system has a hall conductivity even in the absence of an external magnetic field @xcite . by using the holographic framework , in this note we are interested in calculating the fermion spectral function , and the normal and hall conductivity in the holographic @xmath0 sc s .",
    "our paper is organized as follow : in section [ sec2 ] we will first introduce our model following @xcite .",
    "we consider the effective action for the charged spin two field in a four dimensional ads - schwarzschild black hole . in order for the system to be ghost free",
    ", we will consider the probe limit .",
    "subsequently in section [ sec3 ] we will obtain the normalizable background spin two field configuration which leads to a dual @xmath0 superconducting phase of a strongly coupled system living on the boundary of ads .",
    "once we identify our required dual complex d - wave condensate background , we can study various linear transport properties of the system by considering linear order fermionic and gauge field perturbations . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we will study the fermionic spectral function and discuss various properties depending upon various parameters such as the majorana coupling , mass of the fermion etc . in section [ sec5 ] we will study the conductivity of the superconducting background . as we have mentioned earlier , because of spontaneous violation of time reversal symmetry due to the background condensation , we found a non - vanishing optical hall conductivity . in the final section",
    "we will conclude with some remarks and discuss future directions .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , the model that we are going to present is in the similar spirit of the holographic dual construction of an s - wave superconductor in an ads black hole spacetime .",
    "it is well known that the phases of d - wave superconductivity can be described by a low energy effective theory of charged spin two tensor field in the framework of landau - ginzburg theory . at low temperature , the background solution of this charged spin two field yields the d - wave order parameter for the high temperature superconductivity .",
    "analogously one particular construction of a holographic model of d - wave superconductor has been considered first in @xcite by taking a charged symmetric traceless spin-2 field in an ads - black hole background .",
    "subsequently , in spite of having long - standing technical and also conceptual problems , a more refined form of the charge spin-2 tensor field effective action has been proposed and studied in the context of pure d - wave superconductor benini:2010pr .",
    "our main goal in this report is to study the properties of the more general @xmath0 superconducting background in ads / cft framework .",
    "one of the theoretical motivations to consider these kinds of systems is to discover some universal low energy properties of general strongly coupled field theories . keeping this motivation in mind ,",
    "we start by considering the action in the bulk containing the gravity part and the matter part as @xmath7where @xmath8 is the ricci scalar , the @xmath9 term gives a negative cosmological constant and @xmath10 is the ads radius which will be set to unity in the units that we use .",
    "@xmath11 is the gravitational coupling .",
    "the lagrangian for the matter fields includes a spin two field and a spin half fermion field .",
    "both of them are charged under u(1 ) gauge field and can be massive .",
    "we write @xmath12    the consistent construction of a charged spin two field theory in curved spacetime background is a long - standing problem .",
    "there have been lot of studies in constructing consistent interacting higher spin field theories @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned , the authors in ref.benini:2010pr have proposed a unique lagrangian for a charged spin-2 field in ads space with the motivation in studying its dual field theoretic properties . in this report",
    "we will adopt their construction with the lagrangian    @xmath13 \\\\ & \\quad -m^{2}\\big(|\\varphi _ { \\mu \\nu } |^{2}-|\\varphi |^{2}\\big)+2r_{\\mu",

    "as it has been discussed in detail in @xcite , the above action describes dynamics of the correct number of degrees of freedom only when the background is einstein s manifold .",
    "so , the energy density of the higher spin field configuration should be very small compared to the background energy density .",
    "this essentially means we have to maintain the probe limit of spin-2 and fermion fields in a specific gravitation background .",
    "however , there still exists serious issues in dealing with the above action . for generic gauge field background , even though it has correct number of dynamical degrees of freedom , the equation motion loses its hyperbolicity or causality .",
    "the general belief is that these violations can be ameliorated by considering higher derivative operators in our lagrangian .",
    "this requirement makes it very complicated to construct a fully consistent lagrangian for the higher spin field in a curved background .",
    "however as has been argued in benini:2010pr , we will adopt the effective field theory point of view , where all these effects could be very small in the limit of very low gauge field strength .",
    "this is essentially the limit in which we will be considering in our subsequent discussions .",
    "in addition to above lagrangian for the spin-2 field , we also consider the spin 1/2 fermion lagrangian as    @xmath21    the bulk gamma matrices @xmath22 satisfies the clifford algebra @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 gauge symmetry demands that the charges of the fermion and spin two field are related by @xmath25 .",
    "it is know that @xmath26 dependent majorana coupling helps the fermion spectral function to develop a gap .",
    "it has been argued that although there are more terms of the same dimension as these @xmath26 terms , only @xmath26 dependent terms gives rise to an anisotropic gap .",
    "thus , we have dropped the other terms for simplicity .    under the field redefinition @xmath27@xmath28",
    "can then be written as@xmath29thus , as @xmath30 while the @xmath28 remains finite , we can work in the so called probe limit to ignore the back reaction of the the matter fields @xmath31 , @xmath14 , and @xmath32 .",
    "also , in the probe limit , the @xmath33 dependence of observables can be recovered through the above simple scaling .",
    "thus , we will work in the probe limit from now on . in this limit",
    ", the gravitational field equation satisfies the einstein equation @xmath34where @xmath35 .",
    "this yields the ads schwarzschild black hole solution with the metric @xmath36with@xmath37where @xmath38 is the black hole horizon and @xmath39 is the boundary .",
    "the hawking temperature can be expressed as @xmath40an important point to note is that , the action is invariant under the scaling transformations@xmath41which determine the conformal dimension of each field . in the following section , we will consider this black hole background in order to solve the equations of motion for the spin-2 and electromagnetic gauge field in the probe limit .",
    "as we know from the standard ads / cft dictionary , the bulk massive spin-2 field corresponds to a spin-2 operator in the boundary field theory with fixed conformal dimension .",
    "the conformal dimension is fixed by the spin-2 mass .",
    "this boundary spin-2 dual operator under boundary lorentz transformations is to be identified with the d - wave order parameter .",
    "our main interest here is to describe the d - wave sc in the dual boundary field theory .",
    "now since the spacetime background that we have considered has a translation symmetry in the boundary direction , the condensation on the @xmath42-@xmath43 plane on the boundary should also have translational invariance .",
    "however rotational symmetry should be spontaneously broken down to @xmath44 with the d - wave like condensate changing its sign under a @xmath45 rotation on the @xmath42-@xmath43 plane . to incorporate these features",
    ", we use an ansatz for the symmetric traceless @xmath14:@xmath46and @xmath47 for @xmath48,@xmath49 , and for the gauge field @xmath31 : @xmath50under a @xmath51 angle rotation in the @xmath42-@xmath43 plan , @xmath52if @xmath53 is real , then we can always rotate the coordinates in the @xmath42-@xmath43 plan such that @xmath54 and then make @xmath55 real by a gauge transformation . otherwise @xmath55 and @xmath56 will both exist .  the equations of motion of the gauge field and the spin two field are    @xmath57    @xmath58    the coupling to the fermion field through @xmath59 is dropped because there is no fermion condensate .",

    "depending on the size of @xmath76 , there could be different scenarios :    \\(a ) if @xmath77 , @xmath78 , we need to set @xmath79 ( the sourceless condition ) to keep @xmath64 finite at the boundary . thus , @xmath80 has the asymptotic solution @xmath81where the physical meaning of @xmath48 is the chemical potential while @xmath82 is the corresponding charge density .",
    "we can always use the scaling of eq .",
    "( [ rescaling ] ) to set @xmath83 . in this case",
    "@xmath84/@xmath85 is a @xmath86 independent constant . because the combination @xmath87 vanishes near the boundary .",

    "\\(b ) if @xmath88 , @xmath89 , one can either chose the @xmath90 or @xmath91 term to be the condensate . if we choose the @xmath90 term to be the condensate for @xmath92 , and choose the @xmath93 term to be the condensate for @xmath94 , then eq.([phi ] ) is still true .",
    "but then @xmath84/@xmath85 is no longer a constant .",
    "\\(c ) if @xmath95 , @xmath96 , if we choose the @xmath90 term to be the source , then eq.([phi ] ) is no longer true .",
    "hence , the physical meaning in this case is unclear .",
    "the other choice of the source goes back to case ( a ) .    in case",
    "( b ) , the two condensates have different dimensions at the boundary . this might imply competition between the two order parameters in the system .",
    "however , the scaling dimension of any primary operator of a conformal field theory has a unitarity bound @xcite .",
    "as has been argued in benini:2010pr , this unitarity bound constrains mass of a spin-2 field as @xmath97 .",
    "thus , in this report , we will just focus on case ( a ) , where @xmath98 .",
    "we have solved the equations of motion for the spin-2 field @xmath99 and gauge field @xmath80 using standard shooting algorithm by demanding @xmath83 and the normalizability of @xmath99 near the asymptotic boundary .",
    "we found the critical temperature @xmath100 for a fixed chemical potential and charge , below which non - trivial bulk profile for the spin-2 field component exists .",
    "according to ads / cft correspondence , the d - wave condensation @xmath101 in the dual boundary field theory is identified with the coefficient of the normalizable solution of @xmath99 . in fig.[fig : condensate ] we show the condensate field ( @xmath102 ) disappears above the critical temperature @xmath103 .",
    "once we know the background condensation , it would be interesting to see the fermionic response function which essentially captures the properties of the background condensation .",
