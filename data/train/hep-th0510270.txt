    "but for black holes which absorb any particles and do not re - emit them , we will have @xmath82",
    "it means that such the object would attract other bodies with a force which is proportional to @xmath73 but not to @xmath83 i.e. einstein s equivalence principle would be violated for them .",
    "this conclusion stays in force for the case of graviton pairing , too .      to ensure an attractive force which is not equal to a repulsive one",

    "for massless transverse bosons , it takes place as by spin @xmath55 as by spin @xmath59 if graviton pairs have maximum spin @xmath88 then single gravitons should have spin @xmath19 but from such particles one may constitute four combinations : @xmath89 ( with total spin @xmath80 ) , and @xmath90 ( with total spin @xmath91 all these four combinations will be equiprobable if spin projections @xmath92 and @xmath93 are equiprobable in a flat wave ( without taking into account a probable spin - spin interaction ) .",
    "but it follows from the energy conservation law that composite gravitons should be distributed only in two modes .",

    "from another side , a spin - spin interaction would cause it .",
    "the spectrum of composite gravitons is also the planckian one , but with a smaller temperature @xmath101    it is important that the graviton pairing effect does not change computed values of the hubble constant and of anomalous deceleration of massive bodies : twice decreasing of a sub - system particle number due to the pairing effect is compensated with twice increasing the cross - section of interaction of a photon or any body with such the composite gravitons .",

    "<S> if gravitons are super - strong interacting particles and the low - temperature graviton background exists , the basic cosmological conjecture about the dopplerian nature of redshifts may be false . in this case , a full magnitude of cosmological redshift would be caused by interactions of photons with gravitons . </S>",
    "<S> non - forehead collisions with gravitons will lead to a very specific additional relaxation of any photonic flux . </S>",
    "<S> it gives a possibility of another interpretation of supernovae 1a data - without any kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> these facts may implicate a necessity to change the standard cosmological paradigm .    a quantum mechanism of classical gravity based on an existence of this sea of gravitons </S>",
    "<S> is described for the newtonian limit . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism needs graviton pairing and `` an atomic structure '' of matter for working it , and leads to the time asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> if the considered quantum mechanism of classical gravity is realized in the nature , then an existence of black holes contradicts to einstein s equivalence principle . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in this approach the two fundamental constants - hubble s and newton s ones - should be connected between themselves . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical value of the hubble constant is computed . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> , every massive body would be decelerated due to collisions with gravitons that may be connected with the pioneer 10 anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> some unsolved problems are discussed , so as possibilities to verify some conjectures in laser - based experiments . </S>"
