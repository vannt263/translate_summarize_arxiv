    "many of its members reside in loose aggregates near the dark clouds while others are scattered more widely across the @xmath5  deg@xmath1 extent of the cloud complex . even in the aggregates , the stellar densities are only @xmath6  pc@xmath7 , which is 1001000 times lower than the densities of the most compact clusters in other nearby star - forming regions . because the stars and cloud cores in taurus are so sparsely distributed , they have served as some of the best available targets for studying the formation of stars in relative isolation .",
    "the close proximity and low density of taurus also made it amenable to observations with early telescopes at x - ray , infrared ( ir ) , and radio wavelengths that had low sensitivity and resolution .",
    "as a result , much of the foundational observational work in the field of star formation has been performed in taurus @xcite .",
    "stars and brown dwarfs within taurus have been sought with a variety of diagnostics of youth and membership , consisting of photometric variability @xcite , emission lines @xcite , proper motions @xcite , uv emission @xcite , optical and near - infrared ( ir ) photometry @xcite , x - ray emission @xcite , and mid - ir emission @xcite .",
    "each survey has been capable of finding members that have specific ranges of mass , extinction , location , and evolutionary stage .",
    "the current census of members has the highest level of completeness in @xmath0  deg@xmath1 fields surrounding the richest stellar aggregates .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) constructed from the known members within those fields @xcite exhibits a large surplus of solar - mass stars relative to the mass functions of clusters like the orion nebula cluster , ic  348 , and chamaeleon  i @xcite . given that more massive stars are often found preferentially near the centers of star - forming clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , it is plausible that the anomalous nature of the imfs measured in the taurus aggregates is at least partially due to mass segregation .    to better determine the degree to which the imf in taurus differs from mass functions in other nearby star - forming regions ,",
    "we have performed a survey for new members of taurus across a large area of the region ( @xmath8  deg@xmath1 ) using optical images from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",

    "we conclude by using our updated census of members to check for imf variations between the sdss fields , the smaller regions surrounding the stellar aggregates in taurus , and denser clusters like ic  348 ( section  [ sec : imf ] ) .",
    "before presenting our survey for new members of taurus , we describe the list of previously known members that we have adopted .",

    ", we searched for a counterpart within @xmath16 in the 2mass point source catalog , which provides photometry in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . approximately 2 million sources were detected in both sdss and 2mass in the field from @xcite .    to identify candidate members of taurus with sdss and 2mass , we constructed extinction - corrected diagrams of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 versus @xmath18 , which are shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "the extinctions for sources in these diagrams were estimated in the manner described by @xcite . in each color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , we have marked a boundary along the lower envelope of the sequence formed by most known members for use in selecting candidate members .",
    "we have omitted the field stars appearing below the boundaries so that the known members in those areas of the diagrams can be more easily seen .",
    "several known members are unusually faint for their colors and fall below the boundaries in the cmds , which is normally attributed to scattered light dominating the observed flux . some of those members are known to have edge - on disks or protostellar envelopes , and most of the others have been suspected of harboring such structures based on similar cmds from previous studies .",
    "we identified sources as candidate members if they appeared above the boundaries in both the @xmath21 and @xmath22 cmds , were not rejected in the @xmath20 cmd , were not rejected as non - members based on proper motions @xcite , and exhibited @xmath23 ( @xmath24k4 ) after correction for extinction .",
    "we describe spectroscopy of the resulting candidates in the next section .",
    "in addition to the candidates from the cmds in the sdss field , we have selected for spectroscopy a sample of miscellaneous candidates that were identified with several other methods .",
    "one of these candidates , 2mass j04144158 + 2809583 , was selected based on its colors in images from irac on _ spitzer _ and wircam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",

    "four and 197 of those spectra were taken with niri and spex , respectively .",
    "the niri spectra are shown after smoothing to the resolution of the spex data .",
    "we have included all spex data for taurus members from our previous studies @xcite , which correspond to 76 spectra in 75 systems .",
    "we have measured spectral types for the candidate members and previously known members of taurus in our spectroscopic sample and have assessed the membership of the former .",
    "we have also estimated extinctions for the members using the spex data , which are sensitive to extinction because they span a large range of wavelengths ( 0.82.5  ) .",
    "the candidates can be divided into the following categories based on their spectra and other properties : highly redshifted emission lines ( galaxies ) ; absorption lines from hydrogen and metals ( early - type stars and giants behind taurus ) ; red , featureless spectra and mid - ir excess emission ( protostars in taurus ) ; absorption bands from tio , vo , and h@xmath41o ( m - type objects in the field and in taurus ) . to distinguish between field dwarfs and taurus members in the latter category , we used gravity sensitive absorption features ( na  i , k  i , h@xmath41o ) and , when available , signatures of youth in the form of strong emission lines and mid - ir excess emission .",
    "as done in our previous studies @xcite , we measured spectral types from the optical spectra of the young objects through comparison to field dwarfs and averages of dwarfs and giants for @xmath42m5 and @xmath43m5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the near - ir spectra were classified with standard spectra from our previous work , @xcite , and @xcite for the field dwarfs and with standard spectra from the appendix for the young objects .",

    "the former are also included in the compilation of classifications for all known members in table  [ tab : mem ] .",
    "for previously known members that have spex classifications that are more uncertain than those available from previous optical spectroscopy , or that serve as near - ir classification standards ( appendix ) , we do not report a spectral type from spex , and instead adopt the previous optical type .    for taurus members that have measured spectral types and that were observed with spex",
    ", we have estimated extinctions by comparing the observed spectral slopes at 1  to the slopes of our young standards .",
    "if the spectral type from spex was uncertain and a more accurate type was available from optical data in a previous study , then we adopted that classification when estimating the extinction .",
    "if the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) at 1  was low , then we estimated the extinction from the slope at longer wavelengths if an absence of mid - ir excess emission indicated that @xmath31-band excess was unlikely to be present .",
    "the resulting extinctions were used for dereddening the spectra in figures  [ fig : ir2][fig : ir8 ] . for taurus members that have measured spectral types but were not observed by spex , we have estimated extinctions with the methods described by @xcite , such as @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "our extinction estimates are presented in table  [ tab : mem ] .",
    "for some of the objects for which we used the same methods as @xcite , our estimates differ from their values because of differences in the adopted spectral types .",
    "our measurements of @xmath47 from the spex data have uncertainties of @xmath20.1  mag for objects that lack strong near - ir excess emission from disks and that have low - to - moderate extinctions ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the uncertainties are larger for the remaining members , particularly when strong excess emission is present throughout the near - ir bands .",
    "most of the spex extinctions agree with the values from the alternative methods in @xcite to within @xmath49 and 0.1  mag for objects with and without large near - ir excesses , respectively .      _",
    "2mass j04345973 + 2807017_. @xcite identified it as a candidate based on mid - ir excess emission .",
    "they obtained a spex spectrum that was consistent with either a field dwarf or a young star , but it appeared to agree better with the former .",
    "however , the gravity sensitive features in our optical spectrum do indicate that it is young . as noted in @xcite , it is much fainter than other members near its spectral type , which indicates that it is either a background young star that is not associated with taurus or a member that is seen in scattered light .",
    "we assume the latter for the purposes of this work .    _",
    "2mass j04153452 + 2913469_. it was selected for spectroscopy based on its mid - ir excess in photometry from _ wise _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite referred to it as a known galaxy , possibly because it is labeled as such by sdss .",
    "our niri acquisition image obtained prior to spectroscopy resolved it as a pair of sources that are separated by @xmath50 , as shown in figure  [ fig : niri ] .",
    "it is unclear which component dominates the mid - ir flux detected by _ wise_. the spectrum of the northern component contains br@xmath51 emission and co absorption , which are indicative of a young low - mass star ( figure  [ fig : ir1 ] ) .",
    "the southern component exhibits extended emission that could be consistent with either a galaxy or reflection nebulosity surrounding a young star . if it is the latter , then it is probably a protostar based on its red , featureless spectrum .",
    "we have attempted to perform a thorough survey for new members of taurus within the sdss field from @xcite in an effort to measure the imf across a large portion of this region . to construct an imf from our updated census of taurus members within the sdss field ,",
    "we have begun by characterizing the completeness of that census . as in our previous imf studies of this kind",
    ", we have investigated the completeness using a near - ir cmd because it is sensitive to members at low masses and high extinctions . in figure",
    "[ fig : hk ] , we show a diagram of @xmath19 versus @xmath22 based on 2mass data for the known members of taurus and other sources with unconstrained membership within the sdss field .",
    "we have omitted objects that are likely to be non - members based on the cmds in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , proper motions , or spectroscopy from this work and previous studies .",
    "the cmd in figure  [ fig : hk ] indicates that the census of taurus members within the sdss field from @xcite has a high degree of completeness for large ranges of magnitude and extinction .",
    "therefore , a sample of known members in the sdss field that have extinctions below a given threshold should be representative of the imf in that field down to a certain mass , assuming that the average extinction does not vary with mass . for our imf sample",
    ", we have selected a threshold that is high enough to encompass a large number of members while low enough that the sample has a high level of completeness down substellar masses , arriving at @xmath52 .",
    "based on figure  [ fig : hk ] , the current census in the sdss field is nearly complete for extinction - corrected magnitudes of @xmath53 within that threshold , which corresponds to masses of @xmath54  @xmath55 for ages of a few myr according to evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "the completeness limit of 0.03  @xmath55 for our extinction - limited sample in the sdss field is similar to the limit of 0.02  @xmath55 for the imf in the xest fields from @xcite . as a result",
    ", the two mass functions can be directly compared . in particular",
    ", we would like to check whether the surplus of solar - mass stars in the xest fields relative to other star - forming regions is also present across a larger area like the sdss field ( see section  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "masses of young stars are typically derived by combining estimates of bolometric luminosities ( from photometry ) and effective temperatures ( from spectral types ) with the values predicted by evolutionary models .",
    "however , because these mass estimates are subject to uncertainties in the adopted bolometric corrections , temperature scales , and models , and because we are primarily interested in detecting variations in the imf between different samples of young stars , we have chosen to use the distributions of spectral types in those samples as observational proxies for their imfs .",
    "the ages of taurus and ic  348 derived from comparisons of their low - mass stars to theoretical isochrones are sufficiently similar ( @xmath21 and 2  myr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that a given spectral type should correspond to the same mass in both regions .",
    "it has been suggested that isochronal ages for star - forming regions may be underestimated by a factor of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "even if that is true for one of the two regions , the relationships between spectral types and masses should still be nearly identical between the regions for masses of @xmath57  @xmath55 according to evolutionary models @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : histo ] , we show the spectral type distributions for our extinction - limited sample in the sdss field . for comparison , we also include the imf sample in the xest fields @xcite and an extinction - limited sample in ic  348 @xcite , which is representative of imfs in nearby star - forming clusters @xcite .",
    "the sample of members in the sdss field exhibits a surplus of stars near m0 ( @xmath58  @xmath55 ) relative to ic  348 , but it is smaller than that in the xest fields .",
    "this indicates that the solar - mass stars are slightly concentrated near the aggregates , and that the imf on large scales in taurus does differ from denser clusters .",
    "thus , it appears that previously reported differences in imfs between taurus and denser clusters were a reflection of modest levels of both mass segregation and imf variations .",
    "we now discuss a recently proposed source of systematic error in measurements of imfs in taurus and other star - forming regions .",
    "the young eclipsing binary brown dwarf 2mass j05352184@xmath590546085 exhibits an anomaly in which the primary is cooler than the secondary @xcite , which has been attributed to a reduction of the primary s temperature by magnetic activity @xcite . if the spectral types of young stars and brown dwarfs can be significantly affected by activity , then their mass estimates , and hence their imfs , may contain large systematic errors @xcite .",
    "@xcite attempted to quantify those errors , concluding that the masses derived from spectral types could be underestimated by up to a factor of two .",
    "such error estimates depend on the adopted conversion between spectral types and temperatures ; a temperature scale for inactive stars was used in those studies . however , if one instead derives masses with a scale for active stars , the systematic errors would be much smaller . for instance , the widely adopted scale from @xcite was designed for use with young stars and brown dwarfs , and thus may account for the typical effects of activity in such populations .",
    "systematic errors can arise at multiple stages in the derivation of masses for young stars ( e.g. , temperature scale , evolutionary models ) , regardless of whether activity is responsible for some of those errors .",
    "the most important question is whether the combination of those various stages produce masses that are accurate @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , the imfs of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs that we have previously derived for star - forming clusters are consistent with mass functions of open clusters @xcite and the solar neighborhood @xcite , and thus show no evidence of large systematic errors .",
    "we have attempted to measure the imf across a larger fraction of taurus than considered in previous imf studies of this region to better determine whether it exhibits an anomalous imf relative to denser nearby clusters like ic  348 . to do this , we have performed a thorough survey for new members within a @xmath240  deg@xmath1 field that was imaged by sdss .",
    "we have obtained spectra of candidate members appearing in cmds for that field , as well as a miscellaneous sample of candidates across all of taurus that were selected with a variety of diagnostics of membership . through our spectroscopy",

    "if field dwarfs are used as the standards when measuring spectral types of young late - type objects at near - ir wavelengths , the resulting types are often systematically later than those that would be derived with optical spectroscopy because the depths of the strongest near - ir features , the steam bands , depend on surface gravity @xcite . in our previous studies , to measure ir spectral types that are tied to those at optical wavelengths , we have classified the ir spectra of young m - type stars via comparison to other young objects for which we have measured optical types .",

    ", we consider objects that satisfy the following criteria : classified at optical wavelengths with our methods for m types or with those from @xcite and @xcite for l types ; member of a nearby cluster or association that has an age of @xmath61  myr or a member of the solar neighborhood that has an age of @xmath62  myr based on gravity - sensitive spectral features ; unlikely to have @xmath31-band excess emission from circumstellar dust based on near- to mid - ir photometry ; and spex spectra that have s / n@xmath63 and good telluric correction are available .",
    "because of their uncertain ages , objects in the solar neighborhood are used only for spectral types in which there are few members of clusters that have accurate optical spectral types and adequate spectra , which corresponds to the l types .",
    "the surface gravities indicated by optical spectra have been previously denoted by suffixes of @xmath30 ( highest gravity ) , @xmath64 , @xmath51 , and @xmath65 ( lowest gravity ) that are appended to spectral types @xcite .",

    "we have observed many of those objects with optical spectroscopy to obtain optical spectral types that have been measured with our methods , facilitating their inclusion in our new standards .",
    "these data were taken with the goodman high throughput spectrograph at the southern astrophysical research ( soar ) telescope on the nights of 2014 may 8 and 9 ( twa 1 , 2 , 3a , 3b , 4 , 5a , 6 , 7 , 8a , 8b , 10 , 11c , 12 , 13 , 16 , 20 , 23 , 25 , 30 , 32 ) and the cerro tololo ohio state multi - object spectrograph ( cosmos ) at the 4  m blanco telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory on the night of 2015 may 12 ( twa 26 , 33 , 34 ) .",

    "the wavelength coverage was roughly 55009500    for both instruments . in table",
    "[ tab : twa ] , we have compiled previous spectral types and our new measurements for the known members of twa . for twa 29 , we have included the spectral type that we have measured from the optical spectrum collected by @xcite , which is nearly the same as one reported in that study . to provide the near - ir spectra needed for our standards , we also observed some of the members of twa with the prism mode of spex ( @xmath40 slit ) on the nights of 2005 december 14 ( twa 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8a , 8b , 26 , 27 , 28 ) , 2011 december 3 ( twa 13 ) , and 2015 april 1922 ( twa 10 , 12 , 11c , 23 , 32 , 33 , 34 ) .      after compiling spex data from this work and previous studies for objects that satisfied our selection criteria , we adjusted the slope of each spectrum among the m types using the reddening law of @xcite so that its @xmath45 color agreed with the typical intrinsic value for a young star at its optical spectral type @xcite .",
    "this was done to correct for reddening by interstellar dust and to facilitate comparison of all spectra near a given spectral type .",
    "the spectral slopes of the l dwarfs were not dereddened since they reside in the solar neighborhood , and thus should have little extinction , and since the intrinsic colors of l dwarfs are not well - determined for the age range in which we are attempting to create spectral standards ( @xmath61  myr ) .",
    "we then compared the spectra of objects with similar optical types and rejected spectra that were outliers in the strengths of their absorption features relative to most other data .",
    "the unrejected spectra within bins of 0.51  subclass were combined with the appropriate weights based on their optical spectral types to produce a spectrum at each 0.5  subclass interval between m0l0 and at l2 , l4 , and l7 .",
    "we compared the spectra between younger and older populations ( taurus and ic  348 versus twa and upper sco ) and found that the 0.71.1 slopes were systematically redder at older ages for types of m3.5m6.5 .",
    "as a result , the spectra of the two populations were split into two standard spectra at each spectral type within that range . in table",
    "[ tab : stand ] , we list the objects used to create the standard spectra , the optical spectral types that were adopted for them , and dates of their spex observations .",

    "the displayed spectra for m4 and m6 apply to the younger populations .",
    "electronic versions of all of the standard spectra are available via figure  [ fig : stand1 ] .",
    "the differences in the 0.71.1 slopes between the younger and older objects are illustrated in figure  [ fig : stand2 ] , where we compare the standard spectra for the two populations at m4 , m5 , and m6 .    because the young l dwarfs that we considered exhibit large variations in their spectral slopes and poorly populate some subclasses , we describe for the individual l subclasses the spectra that we chose to use as standards and those that we rejected . in this discussion , we quantify differences in the slopes in the spex data between pairs of objects in terms of the amount of extinction , @xmath69 , that would produce the same difference via reddening . at l0 , 2mass j01415823@xmath594633574 , 2mass j22134491@xmath592136079 , 2mass j23153135",

    "for the one known member of taurus with an optical spectral type of l0 , 2mass j04373705 + 2331080 @xcite , the spex spectrum from @xcite agrees with our l0 standard except that the taurus object is redder by @xmath72 , which is likely due to some combination of extinction and an intrinsically redder color .",
    "the latter is plausible given that it is likely younger than the field l dwarfs we have considered , and l dwarfs tend to have redder near - ir colors at younger ages @xcite . at l1 , only 2mass j05184616@xmath592756457 satisfied our criteria for consideration as a standard , and its spectrum differs only slightly from the l0 standard in the depths of its steam bands and its spectral slope .",
    "therefore , we have not adopted a standard spectrum for that spectral type . at l2 ,",
    "2mass 05361998 - 1920396 and 2mass 00550564 + 0134365 have similar spectra except for a modest difference in their spectral slopes ( @xmath73 ) , so we have adopted the mean of their spectra as the l2 standard . among the l4 dwarfs that we examined , 2mass j15382417@xmath591953116 has the bluest spectrum , and 2mass j05012406@xmath590010452 , 2mass j15515237 + 0941148 , 2mass j01262109 + 1428057 , and 2mass j16154255 + 4953211 are redder by @xmath73 , 0.4 , 1.8 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "the steam bands are slightly weaker in the latter two objects than in the others .",
    "we have adopted the mean of 2mass j05012406@xmath590010452 and 2mass j01262109 + 1428057 as the l4 standard . the one l3@xmath51 dwarf with a spex spectrum , 2mass j22081363 + 2921215 , is bluer than our adopted l2 standard , and",
    "thus does not follow the trend of redder spectra with later l types , making it unsuitable as a standard .",
    "the only two l5 dwarfs that we examined are 2mass j05120636@xmath592949540 and 2mass j03552337 + 1133437 ; the former is similar to the l4 dwarfs and the latter is an outlier in its slope and the depths of its steam bands , so we have not adopted a standard at l5 . since optical spectral types have not been defined for young l dwarfs later than l5 @xcite , we have adopted the near - ir types of l7 that have been proposed for twa 41 and 42 @xcite and we take the mean of their spectra as the standard at that type .",
    "we note that the near - ir spectrum of the young late - l dwarf pso j318.5338@xmath5922.8603 @xcite is similar to the data for those twa members except that it is redder by @xmath74 .",
    "our standard spectra have been designed for classifying m- and l - type objects that have ages of @xmath61  myr .",
    "most objects at these ages reside in clusters and associations that are embedded within molecular clouds .",
    "populations like upper sco that are no longer associated with molecular clouds also can exhibit noticeable reddening ( @xmath75 ) from the interstellar medium beyond the local bubble ( @xmath76  pc ) . as a result , to classify an object s spectrum with our standard spectrum",
    ", one should identify the combination of spectral type and reddening that provides the best fit . even in the presence of reddening ,",
    "it is normally possible to measure ir types with errors of only @xmath77 at m types .",
    "however , because the depths of the steam bands do not vary significantly among the l types , there is greater degeneracy between spectral type and reddening , resulting in larger uncertainties in the two parameters .",
    "the degeneracy is illustrated in figure  [ fig : stand4 ] , which shows that the unreddened standards at l2 , l4 , and l7 are similar to reddened versions of the standards at l0 , l2 , and l4 , respectively . because young l dwarfs at a given optical spectral type exhibit a fairly large range of spectral slopes ( section  [ sec : construction ] ) ,",
    "a similar degeneracy is present in the ir classifications of young l dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we have applied our standard spectra to a sampling of ir spectra that have been classified in other studies .",
    "we frequently arrive at types that are earlier than the previous results .",
    "examples of three such objects are shown in figure  [ fig : stand3 ] , where we compare their spectra to our best - fitting standards and our standards for the previously reported types .",
    "the first object , twa  40 , was previously classified as l0 and l1 at optical and ir wavelengths , respectively @xcite .",
    "we find that our m9.5 standard provides the best match to its ir spectrum .",
    "the ir type from @xcite was partially based on a comparison to members of upper sco that had been classified as l0l1 with ir data @xcite .",
    "however , optical spectroscopy indicates that several of those sources in upper sco have spectral types near m9 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* k. luhman , in preparation ) , which would explain why @xcite found a type later than our value .",
    "the second object in figure  [ fig : stand3 ] , 2mass j15575011@xmath592952431 , is a similar example of a source previously classified as early l @xcite for which we measure a type near m9 .",
    "our ir classification agrees with the optical spectral type of that object @xcite . finally , we compare in figure  [ fig : stand3 ] the ir spectrum of 1rxs j160929.1@xmath59210524  b @xcite to our best - fitting standard ( m9.5 with @xmath78 ) and our standard for the type of l4 that was measured by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the companion agrees well with m9.5 , and is too blue to be a typical young l4 dwarf . the extinction estimate from our classification is lower than the value of @xmath79 derived by @xcite through a comparison of the observed near - ir spectral energy distribution to model predictions .",

    "<S> we have performed a survey for members of taurus across a large field ( @xmath240  deg@xmath1 ) that was imaged by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained optical and near - infrared spectra of candidate members identified with those images and the two micron all sky survey , as well as miscellaneous candidates that were selected with several other diagnostics of membership . </S>",
    "<S> we have classified 22 of the candidates as new members of taurus , which includes one of the coolest known members ( m9.75 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our updated census of members within the sdss field shows a surplus of solar - mass stars relative to clusters , although it is less pronounced than in the smaller fields towards the stellar aggregates that were surveyed for previously measured mass functions in taurus . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to spectra of our new members , we include in our study near - ir spectra of roughly half of the known members of taurus , which are used to refine their spectral types and extinctions . </S>",
    "<S> we also present an updated set of near - ir standard spectra for classifying young stars and brown dwarfs at m and l types . </S>"
