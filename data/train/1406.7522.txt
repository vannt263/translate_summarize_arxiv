    "it has been suggested that a deconfined quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) has been produced in heavy ion collisions at top rhic energies .",
    "one evidence is the strong @xmath0 , which is defined as the second coefficient of the following fourier expansion : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a reference axis often identified with either the participant plane or reaction plane and @xmath6 is the azimuthal angle of the particles . in non - central heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the overlap area has an almond shape with a long axis and short axis .",
    "model calculations indicate that different pressure gradients along the two axes will produce a large @xmath7 .",
    "the unique geometry shape of uranium nucleus provide opportunities to further test our understanding of the particle production mechanism and @xmath0",
    ". the larger size of uranium nucleus provides higher energy density . on the other hand ,",
    "the uranium nucleus are not spherical and have a prolate shape , which leads to different collision geometry shapes from body on body to tip on tip configurations , even with fully overlap collision . in the case of tip on tip collisions ,",
    "the produced particle multiplicity should be higher due to larger number of binary collisions , while the @xmath0 are smaller since the overlap region is symmetric , while in case of body on body collisions , one should observe a smaller multiplicity associated with larger @xmath0 .",
    "thus if our understanding of particle production is correct , a strong correlation between multiplicity and @xmath0 should exist in u+u collisions compared with more symmetric system like au+au .",
    "the data sets for this analysis were collected by star detector from au+au at @xmath3 = 200 and u+u collisions at @xmath3 = 193 gev in year 2011 and 2012 , respectively .",
    "all charged particles within pseudo - rapidity @xmath8 and transverse momentum @xmath9 gev / c were analyzed by the time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the zero - degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) were used to select fully overlap events based on spectator neutrons .",
    "only events with primary vertices within 30 cm of the tpc center in the beam direction were analyzed .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency was obtained from geant - based monte carlo simulation and the results presented here are corrected for reconstruction efficiency .    in this analysis",
    ", @xmath7 is calculated via the two- and four- particle cumulant methods ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "the q - cumulant method  @xcite allows us to calculate @xmath2 without using generating functions or calculating an event plane thus it is simpler to perform .",
    "the two - particle cumulant is calculated from @xmath10>-<\\cos(\\varphi _ 1)><\\cos(\\varphi _ 2)>-<\\sin(\\varphi _ 1)><\\sin(\\varphi _ 2)>.$ ] in order to remove correlations from hbt , coulomb effects and track - merging , we reject pairs with @xmath11 0.1 .",

    "the @xmath13 results are calculated from @xmath15 and by taking the fourth root . for illustration purpose ,",
    "we plot the imaginary @xmath13 results as negative values .",
    "the au+au @xmath13 results show a centrality dependence and turn negative ( imaginary ) at central collisions .",
    "this is allowed due to the fact that @xmath13 results contains flow fluctuations and the flow signal from central collisions is small due to symmetrical collision system . unlike @xmath13 results in au+au ,",
    "the @xmath13 results in u+u are always positive at central collisions .",
    "the non - zero @xmath13 in central u+u collision ccould result from the intrinsic prolate shape of the uranium nucleus : although the impact parameter is small in central u+u collisions , the prolate shape of uranium nucleus still provides an almond shaped overlap region on average and thus produces this non - zero @xmath13 result .    as discussed previously , high multiplicity events would have predominantly tip - tip collisions , which also produces relatively smaller @xmath0 .",
    "it has been predicted that a unique knee structure will be present in high multiplicity collisions if one plot @xmath7 vs. charged multiplicity  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath12 results from u+u data show no indication of such a knee structure . the non - zero @xmath13 and lack of knee structure in @xmath12 together",
    "could indicate that although the prolate geometry shape of uranium nuclei do show up in the data , there might be additional fluctuation that washes out this knee structure in @xmath12 results  @xcite .",
    "another interesting topic is the @xmath0 divided by the initial anisotropy @xmath16 in coordinate space .",
    "it has been found previously that @xmath17 increases with @xmath14 and saturates at central collisions .",
    "this saturation is consistent with the picture that the system collectivity approaches hydrodynamical limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig01 ] ( right ) shows the @xmath17 from 200 gev au+au and 193 gev u+u collisions .",
    "both u+u and au+au follow the same trend for @xmath17 , however , a turn - over is observed at central collisions where the initial geometry of the overlap region plays a dominant role .",
    "the turn - over may indicate an overestimation of @xmath16 in central collisions while other origins like hydro fluctuation are also possible .    in order to take advantage of the prolate shape of uranium nuclei",
    ", one needs to separate fully overlapped body on body and tip on tip collisions .",
    "unfortunately , rhic is not capable of providing polarized uranium beam so it relies on experimental observables to disentangle the body on body vs. tip on tip collisions .",
    "one strategy is to use spectator neutrons measured by the zdc to select fully overlap collision , then one could use charged particle multiplicity to select body on body or tip on tip enhanced samples  @xcite . in case of body on body collision , the multiplicity will be lower due to smaller number of binary collisions , while the @xmath0 will be larger due to the almond overlapping region . for tip on tip collisions",
    ", there will be a higher multiplicity associated with small @xmath0 .",
    "thus a strong correlation between multiplicity and @xmath0 could serve as an evidence of selection of geometry orientations .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig03 ] shows the @xmath0 of all charged particles as a function of the normalized multiplicity .",
    "the left panel shows the results for top 1% zdc central events . since the deformation of gold nuclei is small , in case of fully overlapping collisions , the multiplicity differences are mainly from fluctuations and there should be no correlations between multiplicity and @xmath7",
    "however , a strong negative slope is observed in both au+au and u+u collisions , which indicates the impact parameter still dominates the observed correlation .",
    "a slightly off - center collisions produces smaller multiplicity and stronger @xmath7 due to almond shaped overlapping region . in order to see the effects from initial geometry ( body on body vs. tip on tip )",
    ", one needs to reduce the effects from impact parameters and select further on fully overlap collisions .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig03 ] shows the same results for top 0.1% zdc central events .",
    "the slope magnitude in au+au collisions is smaller , indicating the effects from non - central collisions are reduced , and the multiplicity differences are mainly driven by fluctuations in au+au , while the slope for u+u become steeper .",
    "this comparison between au+au and u+u serves as an evidence of selection of geometry orientation enhanced sample based on multiplicity .",
    "on the other hand , the glauber model predicts a steeper slope for u+u collisions and a positive slope for au+au due to its oblate shape .",

    "is applied to extract the slope parameter.the dash lines represent glauber simulation slopes calculated via eccentricity.,width=600 ]    to further test the correlation between multiplicity and @xmath0 , a linear fit is applied and the slope parameter is extracted .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig04 ] ( left ) shows the slope parameter for 200 gev au+au and 193 gev u+u events as a function of zdc centrality . with tighter zdc cuts , the slope magnitude decreases in au+au , indicating the effects from the impact parameter",
    "are reduced , while the u+u slope parameter increases ( more negative ) .",
    "this stronger correlation between @xmath0 and multiplicity in u+u is due to the fact that with more central collisions selected by the zdcs , the diffusion effects from impact parameter are reduced ( at large impact parameter , central body on body and off - center tip on tip collisions produce the same multiplicity but different @xmath7 ) .",
    "the comparison between au+au and u+u indicates that @xmath14 can help to select tip on tip vs. body on body enhanced samples .",

    "it has been demonstrated that by combining cuts on zdc and charged particle multiplicity , one can select body - body or tip - tip enhanced samples of central u+u collisions . the capability of selecting initial geometry in u+u collisions provides new opportunities to study path - length dependent jet quenching and local parity violation in the future ."
