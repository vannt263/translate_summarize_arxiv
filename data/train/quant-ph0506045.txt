    "one of the fundamental transformations in quantum physics is the projective measurement transformation , which sets a correspondence between quantum theory and real physical experiment @xcite . despite the fact that physical realization of this type of quantum transformations , which preserve the states of the measurable quantum variables , i.e. , _ nondemolition measurements _ , causes experimental difficulties ,",
    "this field of experimental quantum physics is still of prime importance @xcite .    from theoretical point of view",
    ", the projective measurement in its simplest variant , i.e. , with no addressing to its generalized variant of indirect measurement , sets one - to - one correspondence between the orthogonal , i.e. , entirely distinguishable , set of states @xmath0 of the measurable system ( we will call it in the following simply the _ object _ ) and the set of orthogonal states of the measuring device ( we will call it in the following simply the _ meter _ ) accompanied with a complete loss of the phase relationships between them . in this case , the principal point is that one can use for the measurement a _ classical _ meter @xcite , which corresponds to the case , when in the final state of the object  meter system after the measuring process take part only those meter states for which their quantum or microscopical nature is not essential .    nowadays , however , progress in experimental quantum physics allows powerful tools for preparation and manipulation with the quantum states @xcite , so that the standard concept of the quantum measurement as the projective measurement transformation can be and has to be revised towards releasing the limitation by the quasiclassical meter only and generalizing the concept of the quantum measurement on the case when the meter is an essentially quantum device .",
    "such generalization of the quantum measurement concept is , obviously , necessary for the adequate discussion of modern experiments in the field of engineering of quantum information using such objects as atoms and ions in various traps and photons of electromagnetic field . at the same time ,",
    "the most useful is not the most possible generalized concept of the quantum measurement , as of an arbitrary quantum transformation , which contains information about the measurable variables ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , but selection of those transformations , which , similar to projective measurement , are based on one - to - one correspondence between the initial states of the object and final states of the meter",
    ". the mechanisms of mapping the quantum information via setting one - to - one correspondence between quantum events , i.e. , with the help of the corresponding classical information index @xmath1 , is undoubtedly the most important representation of quantum information relations and has fundamental value for understanding of the basic grounds of quantum mechanics .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the so called soft quantum measurement , which is the simplest model for a generalized quantum measurement that introduces in a concentrated form all essential physical mechanisms responsible for inevitable disturbance of the initial quantum information and the competitive character of the process of its attainment , which results , as it is widely known , in the possibility of reliable detection of the fact of its unauthorized usage .",

    "the content of the input information allows establishment of such correspondence with the classical parameter due to the assumed orthogonality of the input states @xmath0 of the object .",

    "the nondemolition projective measurement corresponds to the choice @xmath14 , which realizes one - to - one correspondence between the initial and the resulting bases of the measurable object , which coincide , and those of the meter at the complete loss of the phase relationships between their elements .    a simplest generalization of the projective measurement , which takes into account essentially quantum character of the meter in the frame of the concept of the  ideal \" , i.e. , nondemolition and absolutely precise , measurement is given with the concept of the so called _ entangling measurement _ @xcite .",
    "following this concept , the entangling measurement presents the measured information in the same form of 100%-correlations , i.e. , as one - to - one correspondence between the states of the object and the meter but , in general case , does not destroy the coherency of the measurable states @xmath0 completely . instead , this measurement represents the resulted information in the form of quantum entanglement in the bipartite object  meter system leaving",
