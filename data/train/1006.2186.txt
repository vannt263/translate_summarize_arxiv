    "understanding the properties of unstable nuclei is one of the most interesting subjects of nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "it is also important for astrophysics ; for example , determination of the precise position of neutron drip line is crucial for the r - process nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of unstable nuclei , among others , is the weak binding of nucleons , so that the proper treatment of continuum ( scattering ) states is very important for the two basic ingredients of the nuclear structure , the shell effect and the pairing correlation  @xcite .",
    "the most popular method of recent years to treat this problem is the selfconsistent mean field theory , especially the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory  @xcite , with suitably chosen ( density dependent ) zero- or finite - range effective interactions  @xcite .",
    "such selfconsistent mean field models can reproduce the very basic quantities like the nuclear mass rather well  @xcite , and can be used to investigate the detailed deformation properties of nucleus . on the other hand , a non - selfconsistent semi - phenomenological method of the strutinsky shell correction approach  @xcite , or often called the microscopic - macroscopic method , has been used for more than forty years in order to calculate nuclear masses , deformations and fission paths . in such an approach , the part of binding energy smoothly varying as a function of nucleon ( proton and neutron ) number is represented by the liquid - drop or the droplet model with parameters adjusted to reproduce the experimental binding energy , on top of which is added the rapidly varying shell energy correction evaluated by assuming some non - selfconsistent single - particle potential .",
    "it is known that there is a close relationship between the two , the selfconsistent mean field and the shell correction approaches  @xcite , but the actual calculational procedures differ considerably and their own merits are quite different .",
    "the number of adjustable parameters is generally fewer and the range of applicability is believed to be wider in the selfconsistent mean field models , whereas the shell correction approach requires much less computational power .",
    "thanks to recent progress of computer power , the root mean square deviation between the calculated and experimental masses , as an example , in some of the selfconsistent mean field models  @xcite is approaching the same level of accuracy as that in the state of the art model of the shell correction approach  @xcite ( or even better ) .",
    "however , its ease of computation and its flexibility of choosing the single - particle potential are still great merits of the shell correction approach .",
    "for example , the various effects of the single - particle orbits can be more directly studied in the shell correction approach . on the contrary , in selfconsistent mean field models ,",
    "a clear - cut picture is sometimes lost due to the complicated selfconsistency between the nuclear mean field and the effective interaction .",
    "although the qualities of the mass fit are similar in the two approaches in stable nuclei , they often give quite different predictions for very heavy nuclei and unstable nuclei near the neutron drip line , where no experimental date are available  @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that the shell correction approach has several difficulties for the calculation of unstable nuclei , which are mainly related to the problem of unbound ( continuum ) states characteristic to weakly bound systems .",
    "the difficulties were carefully examined one by one in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first and the most crucial difficulty is that the shell correction energy can not be unambiguously determined for the single - particle potential with finite depth , which is indispensable for describing weakly bound states . the energy of shell correction is defined as the difference between the sum of single - particle energies up to the fermi level and its smoothed part . the conventional way of the smoothing procedure utilizes the energy averaging of the single - particle level density over the interval @xmath0 of the typical shell spacing , @xmath1 mev , where @xmath2 is the mass number .",
    "if the absolute energy of the fermi level is smaller than the shell spacing , the averaging inevitably involves the unbound states .",
    "the continuum single - particle levels are usually discretized by using , e.g. , the harmonic oscillator basis expansion , but blind inclusion of them leads to divergent results as the basis is enlarged even in stable nuclei  @xcite ; this is simply because the level density of continuum states itself is a divergent quantity .",
    "it is proposed that the level density above the threshold should be replaced  @xcite with the so - called continuum level density  @xcite , and the resultant smoothed energy is shown to be convergent  @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the continuum level density requires the energy derivative of the phase shift , or of the scattering matrix in general , so that the calculation is cumbersome for spherical nuclei and difficult for deformed nuclei .",
    "a breakthrough was given by kruppa  @xcite , who proposed a powerful practical prescription to calculate the continuum level density by using the fact that it is written as the difference between the level densities with and without the mean field potential  @xcite .",
    "however , the problem remains ; the so - called plateau condition  @xcite , which guarantees that the shell correction energy is independent of the smoothing procedure , is not well satisfied generally  @xcite .",
    "we reinvestigate the meaning of energy smoothing procedure and consider a remedy to recover the plateau condition as much as possible employing the kruppa s prescription .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are different methods to calculate the smoothed part .",
    "one is to make averaging with respect to the particle number , not to the single - particle energy , only by employing the bound states  @xcite .",
    "however , the resultant smoothed energy depends sensitively on how to perform the averaging for nuclei near the drip line  @xcite , where there is no unoccupied bound states and thus one has to tackle a difficult task to estimate an average value at a point ( a particle number ) using data points only on one side of that point ( at smaller particle numbers ) .",
    "it is also a problem that the smoothed part does not necessarily behave like the liquid - drop model as a function of deformation  @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent developments .",
    "another method is to apply the semiclassical wigner - kirkwood expansion of the single - particle partition function  @xcite .",
    "the relation to the strutinsky shell correction method was discussed  @xcite , and the treatment of realistic potentials with the spin - orbit term was developed  @xcite .",
    "this method was recommended in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain the smoothed energy unambiguously .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent developments .",
    "however , to achieve the same accuracy as the conventional strutinsky shell correction , one has to include up to the third order terms in @xmath3 .",
    "the lowest term is nothing but the thomas - fermi energy .",
    "the calculation is rather complicated especially for the case without spherical symmetry .",
    "it should be also noticed that the semiclassical level density diverges at the threshold ( or the barrier top in the case with the coulomb potential ) , which has non - negligible effects for drip line nuclei  @xcite . in this paper , we stick to the conventional energy smoothing procedure and do not consider these other possibilities .",
    "the second difficulty in the shell correction approach with the continuum states included is the treatment of the pairing correlation , for which the simple bcs approximation is usually used with the `` diagonal '' ( seniority ) pairing force .",
    "the force strength is fixed according to the model space employed by the smoothed pairing gap method  @xcite . since the pairing model space is taken to be within about the major shell spacing above and below the fermi level , the same problem as that of the smoothed energy arises for unstable nuclei , where the fermi level is so close to the threshold that the unbound states enter into the model space .",
    "this is a serious problem because finite occupation probabilities of unbound states lead to the formation of `` neutron gas '' surrounding nucleus .",
    "a complete solution of this problem requires the coordinate - space hfb method  @xcite .",
    "the pairing energy is also affected by the continuum states in such an uncontrollable way that it increases infinitely as more number of states are considered .",
    "it is a major obstacle to the unambiguous prediction of the drip line  @xcite .",
    "we extend the kruppa s prescription to the treatment of the pairing correlation and try to solve this problem .",
    "the third difficulty in the the shell correction approach , which is not particularly related to the unbound states , is the inconsistency between the fermi energy of the chosen single - particle potential and that of the macroscopic part  @xcite ; this kind of problems do not appear in the selfconsistent mean field approach , since the single - particle potential adjusts itself to give the correct fermi energy .",
    "though this problem is negligible in stable nuclei , it becomes severer near the particle threshold , which easily shifts the drip line by about ten particle number . in ref .",
    "@xcite , parameters of a woods - saxon potential are adjusted in accordance with the bulk nuclear asymmetry of the droplet model ; it is found that a fine tuning is necessary to obtain the coincidence of the fermi energy of the adjusted potential with that of the macroscopic part . in this paper",
    "we solve this problem with an automatic adjustment of the potential depth in the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to solve the difficulties of the conventional microscopic - macroscopic approach .",
    "we propose remedies to all the three difficulties mentioned above .",
    "although our remedies are not perfect ones , we believe that a combined use of them gives much more reliable results for the shell correction calculations of unstable nuclei near the drip lines .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "namely the conditions are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the frequency for spherical shape and @xmath57 denotes average value based on the uniform sharp - cut density .",

    "however , this approach seems rather distant from what is proposed in the present paper .",
    "we have examined the fourier transform of the smoothing function of strutinsky to find that it is nothing but a low - pass filter , which passes only short - time components .",
    "the polynomial part of the filter is simply a truncated taylor expansion of @xmath117 where @xmath344 is the time multiplied by the smoothing width @xmath0 and divided by @xmath106 .",

    "we have also derived a relation between @xmath0 and the order of the polynomial part @xmath93 that changing @xmath0 proportionally to @xmath131 leaves the results of smoothing almost unchanged .",
    "this picture of the strutinsky smoothing as a low - pass filter is general and will be useful for investigating the other smoothing functions , e.g. , those of ref .",
    "@xcite , than the standard one considered in the present work .    from this point of view",
    ", we have given a negative perspective to the problem of the plateau for the woods - saxon spectrum , a problem concerning the shell correction energy in the microscopic - macroscopic method .",
    "it has been known that the shell correction energy for the nilsson spectrum behaves like a long flat plateau as a function of @xmath0 while that for the woods - saxon spectrum does not show such a magnificent plateau in general .",
    "we have noticed that the fourier transform of the nilsson spectrum has an interval of time components where the amplitude is almost vanishing , while that of the woods - saxon spectrum does not have such an interval .",
    "a plateau appears when the cutoff of the filter is in such an interval .",
    "instead , we have proposed a new method to weaken the dependence on the smoothing width @xmath0 .",
    "we call it the reference density method , in which the smoothing is applied only to the deviation from a reference level density , which was prepared in such a way that the peak around energy zero of the kruppa s level density , which is another principal subject of this paper , is not washed away .",
    "we have demonstrated that the method works well in the desired direction .",
    "to apply the woods - saxon - strutinsky method ( the microscopic - macroscopic method with finite - depth potentials ) to nuclei near the nucleon drip lines , it seems necessary to employ the kruppa s prescription for positive energy levels , in which the spectrum is defined as the woods - saxon spectrum subtracted by the free - nucleon spectrum , both of which are obtained through diagonalizations in the same oscillator basis .",
    "we have discussed the ground for this prescription as well as its relation to the continuum level density .",
    "we have also proposed the oscillator - basis thomas - fermi approximation , with which one can describe spectra obtained from diagonalization in truncated oscillator bases .",
    "we have demonstrated that this approximation can reproduce average behaviors of the woods - saxon , free , and kruppa s level densities .",
    "one can also use this approximation to show analytically the convergence of the results with kruppa s prescription versus the size of the oscillator basis .",
    "we have also introduced the kruppa - bcs method , in which we modified the bcs equation for the pairing correlation so that it can be applied to the kruppa s level density by taking into account negative contributions from the free - nucleon spectrum .",
    "the kruppa - bcs method is applicable to any cases , while the ordinary bcs method becomes very faulty especially when the diagonalization basis is not small and the nucleus is very neutron - rich .",
    "we have also studied how to determine the strength of the pairing interaction to be used in the kruppa - bcs method .",
    "an important conclusion is that , in adjusting the strength to reproduce the empirical smooth trend of the pairing gap with the smoothed kruppa s level density in the gap equation , one should carry out the energy integral without using the uniform level density approximation .",
    "the inconsistency between the macroscopic and the microscopic parts ( i.e. , the liquid drop model and the single - particle potential ) is another problem to the application of the method to nuclei near the drip lines . calculating masses in the whole nuclear chart with several parameter sets for the woods - saxon potential using the methods developed in this paper , we have found that the neutron drip line of the microscopic part is located typically more than ten neutrons inside the dripline of the total energy .",
    "we have proposed a method to readjust the depths of the central potentials to achieve the consistency within the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "although the method contains two simplifications , assuming the spherical symmetry and neglecting the spin - orbit potential , the method has worked very well to shift the microscopic dripline close to the total dripline .    we are going to apply the methods presented in this paper to extend our studies @xcite on the origin of the prolate - dominance of the atomic nucleus from the nilsson potential to the woods - saxon potential .",
