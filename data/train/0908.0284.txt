    "the family of globally o(@xmath0 ) invariant nonlinear sigma models , also called @xmath0-vector models , are very important statistical systems . for obvious reasons , in three space dimensions , they play a very prominent rle in condensed matter physics .",
    "we here only mention the xy model ( @xmath1 ) , relevant for the description of liquid helium , and the heisenberg model ( @xmath2 ) for magnets . in high energy physics",
    "the four dimensional versions appear as effective field theories , for instance for pion physics , and a lot of interest focuses also on two ( euclidean ) dimensions .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that these field theories are asymptotically free and share features with qcd like asymptotic freedom and dimensional transmutation with the nonperturbative generation of a scale like @xmath3 .",
    "for example the study of a nonperturbative renormalized coupling constant in @xcite was an important preparation for the qcd schrdinger functional methods @xcite .    with regard to the technique of monte carlo simulation , our main access to the models beyond perturbation theory , since about 20 years we are in an exceptional situation with regard to the o(@xmath0 ) models .",
    "the method of cluster updates @xcite for embedded z(2 ) ( ising ) degrees of freedom @xcite allows to painlessly enter the critical region , which unfortunately is in stark contrast to our possibilities in qcd . the hope that the cluster method would be widely generalizable",
    "was unfortunately disappointed in the following years , at least for high energy physics . in @xcite",
    "even a kind of ` heuristic no - go theorem ' was given concerning the generalization to sigma models with other spin manifolds .",
    "with the advent ( or rather recognition ) of @xcite a completely different strategy to overcome slowing down has appeared : simulate the strong coupling graphs ( to arbitrary order ) instead of field configurations .",
    "close to criticality the relevant field configurations are long - distance correlated .",
    "the cluster method , using an auxiliary percolation process , manages to execute collective moves that are thermodynamically appropriate for this case .",
    "such moves seem to be difficult to find ( and implement efficiently ) in general .",
    "the strong coupling graphs that are relevant at criticality are large and numerous .",
    "the clever idea of prokofev and svistunov @xcite was to generate them not for the partition function alone , but to simultaneously consider the two point correlation .",
    "they have demonstrated in simple models that local deformations can pass between such graphs without significant obstructions and thus a relevant sample can be simulated . to avoid confusion",
    "we remind the reader of the following . in ordinary strong coupling expansions",
    "one takes the thermodynamic limit term by term and then the series usually has a finite radius of convergence which is often related to phase transitions . a finite lattice regularizes such singularities ( for compact fields at least ) and we can compute everything to in principle arbitrary precision by a convergent expansion for arbitrary couplings or temperature . while close to criticality this is impractical by conventional systematic expansion",
    "the stochastic evaluation is feasible .",
    "we may now also speak about an equivalence with another statistical system which incidentally has only discrete variables . note that , although there are some similarities , this is not a complete duality transformation in the sense of kramers and wannier @xcite .",
    "in a recently begun series of papers @xcite , @xcite we have started to further work out the new approach . beyond the ising model we could apply it to fermions . due to the sign problem",
    "this is at the moment still restricted to two dimensional systems like the gross - neveu model @xcite .",
    "a novelty that one has to appreciate is that the generated graphs can be adapted to the observables that one is interested in .",
    "one then needs several simulations for different quantities .",
    "we nonetheless see these dedicated simulations as a strength of the method . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite it was found that this extra effort can result in enhanced precision for interesting observables .",
    "in this article we successfully extend the all - order strong coupling method to the class of o(@xmath0 ) nonlinear sigma models in arbitrary dimension .",
    "we first achieve this for the standard lattice action which allows to confirm our results by comparing to other data in the literature .",
    "while the standard action has a relatively complicated all - order expansion we can define another action by insisting on a simpler expansion . formally it can be argued to lie in the same universality class , but on the other hand it looks like a rather radical mutilation of the original spin model .",
    "we simulate its graphs and find that at least one universal result is reproduced quite accurately and universality is confirmed",
    ". this flexibility will hopefully be useful to tackle further more complicated models in the future .    in section 2",
    "we develop the loop model equivalent to the all - order expansion of the o(@xmath0 ) system . in section 3",
    "we discuss how to represent the loop configurations in the computer and how to sample them .",

    "it is often fruitful to first analyze graphs in an abstract manner and to separately consider their embedding on the lattice @xcite . at the abstract level",
    "each graph @xmath42 consists of lines and 2-vertices where two lines meet complemented with exactly two additional 1-vertices from the field insertions .",
    "we label all vertices with distinct integers .",

    "we have found a representation for any embedded graph that we outline now .",
    "this is by no means unique",
    ". our representation will actually be quite redundant by including extra information that will be found useful when we set up an update scheme in the next subsection . with any @xmath31 we associate a list @xmath65 which can be viewed as matrix @xmath66 .",

    "as a consequence , in ( @xmath81 ) we can step through such lines which are still needed even without holding a vertex .",

    "we show the labeling of lattice sites , the other integers are vertex labels .",
    "the solid line , connecting 1 with 2 ( via 7 and 11 ) is the active loop and there are two additional closed passive loops which overlap at site 5 .",
    "as already mentioned there is no hard bound on the number of rows / vertices that are needed in @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , as @xmath31 is updated ( modified ) , vertices are added and eliminated and thus rows of @xmath65 are freed ( possibly with the exception of the entry in column 5 ) and new ones are required . as the available storage is finite , this requires some management which may seem difficult at first sight .",
    "luckily this problem can be handled rather easily .    as argued before the average total number of vertices will be of order @xmath84 .",
    "as an extensive quantity its fluctuations are found to be only of the order @xmath85 . we thus found that reserving space for @xmath86 lines with @xmath87 of order unity leads to completely negligible probabilities to ever exhaust this space in any feasible simulation .",
    "these storage requirements are quite similar to ordinary simulations . by observing the fluctuations of @xmath88 one",
    "can easily demonstrate failure probabilities like for example @xmath89 which can be tolerated .",
    "we come back to this in section 4 .    for recycling list entries we keep another list with a reservoir of indices of completely unused rows that are available for new vertices .",
    "there is a subtlety here .",
    "as mentioned before a line not carrying a vertex anymore can still be relevant as a ` stepping stone ' in ( [ xchain ] ) .",
    "such rows we call ` unused ' as opposed to ` completely unused ' .",
    "if we run out of completely unused rows during a simulation we start a recycling routine which runs through the whole list . in this process",
    "all @xmath90 where @xmath91 and the associated entries in @xmath82 are recomputed and all rows with @xmath92 acquire the ` completely unused ' status .",
    "it turns out that the time spent for list recycling is a negligible fraction of the total in practice .",
    "we end this subsection by reproducing in table [ tab1 ] the lists @xmath65 and @xmath82 associated with the configuration in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    ".the list @xmath65 corresponding to the configuration in figure [ fig1 ] ( upper two parts ) .",
    "it has been augmented by the leftmost ( zeroth ) column exhibiting the row indices .",
    "completely unused lines have been omitted .",
    "the lower list is the entry table @xmath77.[tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in figure [ fig5 ] we plot our ssf data .",
    "the left panel shows @xmath93 versus @xmath94 with the star at zero giving the exact continuum limit @xcite .",
    "it is very obvious that the data deriving from the action in ( [ zuv1 ] ) ` know ' about the universal value . in @xcite",
    "a detailed investigation on the symanzik effective field theory for the lattice artifacts in the two dimensional o(@xmath0 ) models was carried out .",
    "the result is that the leading term for o(3 ) is expected to be of the form @xmath95 with subleading contributions having smaller powers of the logarithm .",
    "this has motivated us to plot @xmath96 versus @xmath97 .",
    "the two lines are linear fits with acceptable @xmath98 values .",
    "the dashed line differs from the solid one by including / omitting the coarsest lattice pair .",
    "we see how plotting matters : what is a short extrapolation in the left plot is an uncomfortably long one in the right panel .",
    "but the artifacts for our action are clearly compatible with the theoretical form .",
    "in addition it is reassuring to note that any non - absurd extrapolation in the left plot would not miss the continuum value by much .",
    "the finest lattice pair agrees with the continuum value within our small statistical error .",
    "we have successfully extended the method of simulating strong coupling graphs instead of fields to the o(@xmath0 ) models .",
    "they are in this way first reformulated as a loop model which is then simulated .",
    "the resulting setup of reformulation plus algorithm is , at least for the mass gap as an observable , similarly efficient as the reflection cluster method . a variant of the lattice boltzmann factor , suggested by simplifying the loop ensemble , was simulated and demonstrated to yield the same continuum step scaling function for a particular value of the coupling .",
    "hence universality is confirmed here in an interesting case .",
    "a direct simulation as a spin model would presumably be difficult due to sign oscillations of the boltzmann weight .",
    "the main goal of this work was not primarily to have another simulation method for the o(@xmath0 ) models .",
    "the main motivation was that the further extension of this technique is possible in a more systematic way than for the cluster method .",
    "after all , many systems possess a strong coupling expansion .",
    "the o(@xmath0 ) model is simply a very well studied case which has taught us important lessons about the general approach . as a byproduct one could now however study the o(@xmath0 ) models for non - integer @xmath0 and",
    "perhaps one could also consider taking the @xmath99 limit ( at fixed @xmath62 ) of the algorithm similarly to the time continuum limit in @xcite .",
    "also , as already indicated above , the study of the individual loop distribution in the spirit of percolation theory could be of some interest .    a modest next step in the main line of",
    "the project will be to consider cp(@xmath100 ) spin models , for which no efficient cluster algorithm exists , at least for the classical models ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "a more long distance goal remains the simulation of lattice gauge theory as an equivalent surface model .",
