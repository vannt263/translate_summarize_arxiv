    "as a non - perturbative and background - independent theory , loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite has achieved great successes in past years : derivations of the quantized area and volume operators @xcite , calculations of black holes entropy @xcite and loop quantum cosmology(lqc ) @xcite , _ etc . _ and the nonperturbative quantization procedure of lqg is also valid for a more general class of four - dimensional metric theories of gravity  @xcite . as an example of lqg , lqc gives a quantization scheme of lqg for a symmetry - reduced model in the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lema^ itre - robertson - walker universe .",
    "the discrete spacetime geometry in lqc scenarios predicts a non - singular bouncing universe in some simplified models , which satisfies most of the astronomical and cosmological observational constraints .",
    "although the quantum correction effects are being diluted with the expansion of our universe , it remains present in a weaker form , especially on / near the super - horizon scales .",
    "recently , the gauge invariant cosmological perturbation theory has been systematically constructed in @xcite for inverse volume corrections and in @xcite for holonomy corrections .",
    "some relevant applications have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "the inverse volume corrections and the holonomy corrections are two main quantum corrections in lqc .",
    "the inverse volume corrections come from the quantization of the inverse of the volume operator in lqg .",
    "the inverse volumes exist in the hamiltonian constraint of gravity and the usual matter hamiltonian , especially in the kinematic terms . since the volume can be taken the value zero , there does not exist well defined inverses of the volume operator . fortunately , with the thiemann trick  @xcite , we can construct well defined inverse volume operators , which bring the quantum corrections . while the holonomy corrections arise from the loop quantization based on the holonomies instead of the direct connection .",
    "the holonomy corrections become important when the energy scale of our universe approaches the planck one .",
    "both the modifications to the scalar and tensor primordial power spectra from the inverse volume corrections are carefully investigated by the authors of @xcite .",
    "their results show that the inverse volume corrections could give rise to the enhancement of the power spectra on the large scales , i.e. , a red - tilt one . however , some other mechanisms such as the non - commutative geometry or string theory  @xcite , could also lead to similar features . therefore",
    "to seek for signature of loop quantum cosmology , the study for the non - gaussianity features in loop quantum cosmology is necessary .",
    "because the primordial non - gaussianities are quite helpful to distinguish inflationary models , so far a lot of papers have been devoted to studying the non - gaussianities in different inflation models , see the relevant references in the nice reviews @xcite .",
    "inspired by the studies of @xcite , in this paper we mainly consider the non - gaussianities from the inverse volume corrections in lqc .",
    "the reason for consider inverse volume corrections only is as following .",
    "we denote @xmath4 as the correction term coming from the inverse volume operator and @xmath5 as the correction term from the holonomy corrections . we can estimate the inverse volume correction as@xcite @xmath6 where the planck density @xmath7 is assumed as the quantum gravity scale . from the above expression",
    ", we can see that the inverse volume corrections behave very differently from what is normally expected for quantum gravity . for low densities ,",
    "the holonomy corrections is small , but the inverse volume one may still be large because they are magnified by the inverse of @xmath8 . for an example , the small holonomy corrections of size @xmath9 then requires the inverse volume corrections larger than @xmath10 even at scale @xmath11 .",
    "these novel features make the investigations on the inverse volume corrections more interesting than the former at sub - planckian inflationary scales .",
    "so we only consider the inverse volume correction in this work .",
    "explicitly , in the perturbation theory in lqc , the inverse volume operator can be captured by a correction function such as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the scale factor of the flrw universe and @xmath14 is introduced to describe the characteristic scale of the inverse volume correction , which is not the planck one in general .",
    "when @xmath15 , we can ignore the correction term .",
    "however , if @xmath16 during inflation , one can not neglect inverse volume corrections . in this case , the correction approximates @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are , respectively , the considered perturbation wave number and some characteristic number involved in the inverse volume correction .",
    "in addition , many works about lqc imply that @xmath20 $ ] @xcite . from the form of the inverse volume correction",
    ", we can see that a small sigma corresponds to a small the inverse volume correct , vice versa .",
    "therefore , as an example , following @xcite , we take @xmath21 in this paper . for",
    "other @xmath22 values the behavior will be similar .",
    "furthermore , in terms of spherical multiples the wave number could be expressed as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 representing for the reduced hubble parameter @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the spherical multiples . in the typical linear regime of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ,",
    "the multiples @xmath26 range in @xmath27 or more .",
    "given all the mentioned observations , we expect some new features in the non - gaussianities will arise .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the characterized sizes and shapes of bispectra in lqc scenarios .",
    "note that the bispectra for the single field slow - roll inflationary model have been calculated in the papers  @xcite . for simplicity and comparison , we study the simplest single field slow - roll inflationary model in lqc .",
    "our results show that the quantum corrections mainly come from the third order interaction hamiltonian , the corrected vacuum state and the corrections to the slow - roll parameters .",

    "that is to say , the interaction hamiltonian we used is the same form as the usual one for the single field inflation models in einstein gravity .",
    "this greatly simplifies our calculations , and more importantly , makes our results robust , i.e. , our results should hold for other inflationary models in lqc scenarios .",
    "although the hamiltonian shares the same forms as the one in einstein gravity , the inverse volume corrections @xmath224 still contribute to the bispectrum .",

    "the results show that @xmath3 is highly correlated with the local type , while @xmath2 is less .",
    "it means that the latter can provide a new window for probing the loop quantum mechanisms using cosmic primordial bispectrum information .",
    "finally , we estimated the order of observable parameter @xmath225 from the inverse volume corrections .",
    "the non - gaussianity from the inverse volume corrections in lqc scenarios is tiny and still undetectable currently , however , considering they are generated by the quantum effect , which is naively expected of the order @xmath226 , our finding becomes non - trivial .",
    "especially , the results obtained in this work should be generalized directly to other inflationary models with large non - gaussianities , in which the inverse volume corrections also becomes large therein .",
    "in addition , in this paper we only investigated the non - gaussianities from the inverse volume corrections , while ignored those from the holonomy corrections , in which the sound speed of scalar perturbations are typically changed . besides , we only investigated in this work the bispectrum from scalar modes , left those from tensor mode unexplored .",

    "<S> however , our results reflect the universal characteristics of bispectrum in loop quantum cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the main corrections to the scalar bispectrum come from two aspects : one is the modifications to the standard bunch - davies vacuum , the other is the corrections to the background dependent variables , such as slow - roll parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the loop quantum corrections make @xmath0 of the inflationary models increase @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that two new shapes of non - gaussian signal arise , which we name @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the former gives a unique loop quantum feature which is less correlated with the local , equilateral and single types , while the latter is highly correlated with the local one . </S>"
