    "_ example _ : a sufficient condition for the second - order approximation ( [ eq : f^(2)_2 ] ) for fidelity amplitude to be exact is that the second - order expansion ( [ eq : dh_2 ] ) itself be exact , which requires the average hamiltonian to be at most a quadratic function of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the perturbation at most a cubic function of @xmath14 , i.e.,@xmath183 implying that the original hamiltonians must be of the form @xmath184",
    "the derivations based on the feynman path integral bypass the conventional semiclassical approximations and therefore allow us to introduce several rigorous statements . if the hamiltonian is up to _ quadratic _ and the perturbation up to _ linear _ , the dephasing representation ( or phase averaging @xcite  or weighted average classical limit @xcite ) is exact .",
    "for example , for displaced simple harmonic oscillators @xmath185 the dephasing representation is exact @xcite if the classical trajectories are propagated with the average hamiltonian @xmath89 since then the hamiltonian difference ( [ eq : deltah_expansion ] ) is indeed linear in @xmath186 and @xmath187 : @xmath188 in contrast , the dephasing representation is _ not _ exact even in this simple system if @xmath3 is used for dynamics since quadratic terms in both @xmath189 and @xmath187 appear:@xmath190 similarly , the dephasing representation is _ not _ exact ( in fact , breaks down rather severely ) for simple harmonic oscillators with different force constants,@xmath191 since the perturbation is quadratic in @xmath189 even if the average hamiltonian is used for dynamics:@xmath192   .\\ ] ] the last simple example provides a particularly bad scenario for the dephasing representation , which can be remarkably accurate in much more complex , even chaotic systems such as the kicked rotor .",
    "unfortunately , undisplaced harmonic oscillators provide a good model for the silent  modes in electronic spectra , i.e. , the modes which are not excited by the electronic transition , and hence are not displaced , but may have a different force constant in the excited state . especially in large molecules , the majority of the modes are silent , but the dephasing representation produces an artificially fast decay of fidelity amplitude @xcite , which in turn gives rise to artificially broadened spectra , often to the point that any structure is lost .",
    "typical molecules are slightly anharmonic , so one can not always use simple semiclassical methods such as the thawed gaussian approximation @xcite , but they are not very chaotic , and hence the surprising accuracy of dephasing representation in chaotic systems does not help . yet , the second - order approximation ( [ eq : f^(2)_2 ] ) for @xmath23 , which is , by definition , exact in harmonic systems with different force constants , could ",
    "if evaluated efficiently  provide an accurate method for computing electronic molecular spectra even in the presence of anharmonicity and wavepacket splitting .",
    "in conclusion , we derived a path integral formula for the quantum fidelity amplitude , which bypasses the conventional semiclassical approximations of past publications .",
    "our first approach used a coordinate path integral for continuous systems and benefited from the explicit connection with the classical liouville propagator .",
    "we note that this path integral approach allows in principle to incorporate the influence of the environment using the familiar feynman - vernon formalism .",
    "all that is required is adding the appropriate bath terms to the action .",
    "the effect of thermal noise would be to broaden the delta functions that arise from the @xmath43 integration , leading to smearing of the phase - factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ft ] ) .",
    "our second approach relied on the phase - space path integral for kicked quantum maps . in the latter context",
    "we also obtained an exact expansion of the exponent of the path integral and derived explicit expressions for the fidelity amplitude in the zeroth , first , and second - order expansions ; the first - order expansion yields exactly the dephasing representation , whereas the second - order expansion yields an approximation which corrects several drawbacks of the dephasing representation and other approximations based on linearizing the semiclassical propagator or path integral .",
    "it remains to be seen if it can be implemented efficiently .      _",
