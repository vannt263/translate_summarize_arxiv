    "it is well known that the radiative corrections to deep inelastic electron proton scattering due to hard real photon emission are very important in certain regions of the hera kinematic domain .",
    "in fact , the initial - state collinear radiation leads to a reduction of the projectile electron energy and therefore to a shift of the effective bjorken variables in the hard scattering process as compared to those determined from the actual measurement of the scattered electron alone .",
    "therefore , radiative events @xmath3 are to be carefully taken into account @xcite .    on the other hand , measuring the energy of the photons emitted very close to the incident electron beam direction @xcite permits to overlap the kinematical region of photoproduction @xmath4 and the dis region with small transferred momenta ( about a few gev@xmath1 ) within the high energy hera experiments .",
    "furthermore , these radiative events may be used to independently determine the proton structure functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( and therefore @xmath7 ) in a single run without lowering the beam energies @xcite .",
    "preliminary results of an @xmath5 analysis using such radiative events were recently presented by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "our aim is to calculate the radiative corrections to neutral current deep inelastic events with simultaneous ( exclusive ) detection of a hard photon emitted very close to the direction of the incoming electron beam @xmath8  rad ) . in the case of the hera collider ,",
    "the experimental detection of photons emitted in this very forward direction is actually possible due to the presence of photon detectors ( pd ) that are part of the luminosity monitoring system of zeus and h1 .",
    "let us briefly review the kinematics for the process under consideration . as the opening angle of the forward photon detector is very small , and since we will only consider cross sections where the tagged photon is integrated over the solid angle covered by this photon detector , we can parameterize these radiative events using the standard bjorken variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 , that are determined from the measurement of the scattered electron , @xmath11 and the energy fraction @xmath12 of the electron after initial state radiation of a collinear photon , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the initial electron energy , and @xmath15 is the energy seen in the forward photon detector .",
    "an alternative set of kinematic variables that is especially adapted to the case of collinear radiation , is given by the _ shifted _ bjorken variables @xcite @xmath16 the relations between the shifted and the standard bjorken variables read @xcite @xmath17    the cross - section under consideration in the born approximation , integrated over the solid angle of the photon detector ( @xmath18 ) then takes the following form : @xmath19 where @xmath20\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 the quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the proton structure functions ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the proton and electron masses , respectively . in the cross - section  ( [ born ] ) we take into account terms proportional to @xmath28 , which may be important at low @xmath29 .",
    "note that the neglect of @xmath30-boson exchange and @xmath31@xmath30 interference is a good approximation , because we are interested mostly in events with small momentum transfer @xmath32 . can be found in ref .",
    "the energies of the initial and final electron , of the tagged photon and of the initial proton @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath15 and @xmath35 are defined in the laboratory reference frame ( i.e. , the rest frame of hera detectors ) .",
    "the cross section  ( [ born ] ) agrees with  @xcite . also note that we explicitly included the correction from the vacuum polarization operator @xmath36 in the virtual photon propagator .",
    "the aim of our work is to calculate the higher order qed radiative corrections for this process in the leading and next - to - leading logarithmic approximation .    in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the model independent qed radiative corrections related to the lepton line , which form a complete , gauge invariant subset for the neutral current scattering process .",
    "the remaining source of qed radiative corrections at the same order , such as virtual corrections with double photon exchange and bremsstrahlung off the partons are more involved and model dependent , they will be considered elsewhere .",
    "our approach to the calculation of the qed corrections is based on the utilization of all essential feynman diagrams that describe the observed cross - section in the framework of the used approximation .",
    "the same approach was used recently for the calculation of the qed corrections for the small angle bhabha scattering cross - section at lep1  @xcite .",
    "this work extends our previous calculation at the leading logarithmic level @xcite and presents the details of the brief outline published in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sez2 ] is devoted to the corrections related with emission of virtual and soft real photons in the hard collinear photon emission dis process . in sect .",
    "[ sez3 ] we consider the radiative corrections due to emission of two hard photons in the collinear kinematics ( where we distinguish between the cases when both photons are emitted close to the initial electron direction and the case when one of the photons is emitted along the initial and the other one along the scattered electron direction ) and the semi - collinear kinematics , where the additional hard photon is emitted at a large angle .",
    "section  [ sez4 ] collects the results obtained and discusses two experimental cases : an exclusive set - up , that assumes that a bare electron can be measured , and a calorimetric one .",
    "we show that , in the latter case for a coarse detector that performs a calorimetric measurement , we can reproduce the result of our previous paper @xcite , where the leading logarithmic approximation was used and where the emission along the final electron was not taken into account .",
    "in conclusion we give some numerical estimates .",
    "the appendices are devoted to details of the calculation .",
    "in order to calculate the contributions from the virtual and soft photon emission corrections , we start from the expression for the compton scattering tensor with a heavy photon  @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the matrix element of the process of compton scattering @xmath39 and the index @xmath40 describes the polarization state of the virtual photon .",
    "this tensor is conveniently decomposed as follows : @xmath41 the expressions for the quantities @xmath42 corresponding to the born approximation are : @xmath43 - 2m^2q^2\\left(\\frac{1}{s^2 } + \\frac{1}{t^2}\\right ) , \\qquad b_{11 } = \\frac{4q^2}{st } - \\frac{8m^2}{s^2}\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "here we have to integrate them over the solid angle of the emitted photon corresponding to the shape of the photon detector .",
    "we need to keep only the terms singular in the limit @xmath45 , since after integration the constant terms contribute only proportional to @xmath46 and can be safely neglected .",
    "another simplification comes from the fact that we need only the symmetric ( and real ) part of the tensor @xmath47 .",
