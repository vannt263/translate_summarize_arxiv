    "using this method we were able to solve the holomorphic saddle - point equations for the values of @xmath0 as large as @xmath64 .",
    "as initial conditions for the halley iterations we choose values @xmath108 randomly distributed in the rectangle @xmath109 , @xmath110 } $ ] , which yields sufficiently many distinct solutions with apriori unknown properties .",
    "we distinguish the solutions up to the obvious symmetry of arbitrary permutations of eigenvalues @xmath14 .",
    "in the main text , we have already mentioned that the hessian matrices of the saddle points with @xmath87 at @xmath74 have @xmath28 negative eigenvalues , and one quasi - zero eigenvalue .",
    "further , non - quasi - zero eigenvalues are all doubly quasi - degenerate . in this supplementary material",
    "we analytically prove the existence of the zero eigenvalue of the hessian at @xmath27 and in the strong - coupling phase , and also consider the other eigenvalues of the hessian matrix in more detail .    at @xmath74 the equation on the eigenstate @xmath111 of the hessian matrix of the action with zero eigenvalue",
    "can be written as the following linear integral equation : @xmath112 } { \\left ( z \\right ) } =   - \\frac{2}{\\lambda}\\cos { \\left ( z \\right ) } \\delta z { \\left ( z \\right ) }   - p.v.\\int\\limits^\\pi_{-\\pi } { { \\rm d } \\/}z^\\prime \\rho { \\left ( z^\\prime \\right ) } \\frac{\\delta z { \\left ( z \\right ) } -\\delta z { \\left ( z^\\prime \\right ) } } { \\sin^2 { \\left ( \\frac{z - z^\\prime}{2 } \\right ) } } = 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 stands for the principal value of the integral , and in the strong - coupling phase with @xmath114 the density function @xmath17 for the vacuum saddle is given by @xmath115 . a direct substitution of @xmath116 into ( [ eq : eigenvector_equation ] )",

    "for the zero mode of the hessian matrix @xmath120 of the @xmath58 saddle in the strong - coupling phase ( solid line ) with numerically calculated eigenvector of @xmath120 which corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue at @xmath64 . ]    at finite @xmath0 , we have found the eigensystem of the hessian matrix @xmath121 numerically using the ` lapack ` routine ` zgeev ` .",
    "first , on fig .",
    "[ fig : zero_mode ] we demonstrate a good agreement between the numerically calculated eigenvector of @xmath121 with smallest ( by absolute value ) eigenvalue and the analytic expression @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the strong - coupling eigenvalue distribution .    on the left plot on fig .",
    "[ fig : hessian_spectral_flow ] we further demonstrate that at finite @xmath0 both the quasi - zero eigenvalue @xmath77 of @xmath124 and the splittings @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 between higher eigenvalues are all controlled by the same exponential @xmath128 .",
    "thus the lowest eigenvalue becomes exactly zero and the higher eigenvalues become exactly degenerate only at @xmath27 .",
    "we also note that apart from the emerging degeneracy , the low - lying eigenvalues of the hessian ( or the degenerate pairs thereof in the strong - coupling phase ) scale approximately as @xmath129 , and the eigenvalues at the upper edge of the spectrum ( see the right plot on fig .  [ fig : hessian_spectral_flow ] ) - approximately as @xmath21 . from the right plot on fig .",
    "[ fig : hessian_spectral_flow ] we see also that the double degeneracy of eigenvalues is absent at the upper edge of the spectrum .      in the saddle - point approximation",
    ", the hessian matrix determines the next - to - leading order correction @xmath130 to the path integral originating from the gaussian fluctuations around saddle points .",
    "it turns out that despite all the interesting properties of the eigenspectrum of the hessian matrix , the full determinant obtained by multiplying all @xmath0 eigenvalues appears to be a rather smooth , almost constant function .",
    "in particular , it seems that the exponentially small contribution of the lowest eigenvalue is compensated in some way by the product of higher eigenvalues .    in order to illustrate the effect of hessian determinant , on fig .",
    "[ fig : res_and_hessians ] on the left we plot the gaussian correction @xmath131 to the saddle - point free energy and compare it with the leading contribution from the saddle action @xmath132 at @xmath133 and @xmath29 .",
    "we also plot the analytic result for the planar free energy @xmath134 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath135 at @xmath27 , in order to visualize @xmath4 corrections to @xmath132 : @xmath136 one can see that as compared to the leading contribution , the gaussian correction due to the hessian is a very slowly changing function of @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , this correction is always negative , thus increasing the saddle point contribution .",
    "furthermore , on the right plot on fig .",
    "[ fig : res_and_hessians ] we plot the difference of the actions of the @xmath45 and @xmath72 ( at weak coupling ) or @xmath63 ( at strong coupling ) saddles , both with and without the gaussian corrections @xmath137 included : @xmath138 where @xmath139 denote the hessian matrices for the saddles with instanton number @xmath28 . for comparison , we also plot the exact large-@xmath0 instanton actions .",
    "again one can see that the gaussian corrections do not result in any significant modifications of the saddle contributions .",
    "we also note that for finite values @xmath133 and @xmath29 used for these plots the transition from the weak - coupling to the strong - coupling regime is shifted towards larger @xmath3 ( of course , at finite @xmath0 this is no longer a phase transition ) .",
    "unfortunately , we can not calculate the gaussian corrections at significantly larger @xmath0 and thus enable direct comparison with , since the calculation of @xmath140 becomes numerically unstable at large @xmath0 and the comparison is anyway impossible due to numerical errors .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath141 it seems that the effect of the inclusion of the hessian is very minor , and can be hardly distinguished from systematic errors due to finiteness of @xmath0 .",
    "we thus conclude that the fluctuations around nontrivial saddles in the gww model should not change the exponential factors @xmath142 in the trans - series .     to the saddle action on the action of the vacuum saddle with @xmath58 ( on the left ) and on the difference of the actions of @xmath45 and @xmath53 ( in the weak - coupling phase ) or @xmath63 ( in the strong - coupling phase ) saddles .",
