    "three - dimensional pattern formation in dissipative systems has been theoretically investigated to some extent for the case of the complex ginzburg - landau equation @xcite  but there seems to be no experimental model for which the theory is quantitatively valid .",
    "qualitatively , many results should also apply to a similar case , pattern formation in 3d excitable media , for which controlled experimental realizations exist ( e.g.  @xcite ) , although the containers are typically rather small . in both systems it seems reasonable to concentrate on the structure and dynamics of the filaments formed by the cores of scroll waves , which largely control the dynamics in the remaining space . in a recent theoretical work , for example",
    ", the filament dynamics was investigated for an anisotropic excitable medium with a twisted anisotropy axis @xcite , a situation found in the human heart muscle .",
    "it was predicted that the filament typically drifts such as to align with the anisotropy axis .",
    "both the complex ginzburg - landau equation and excitable media exhibit traveling waves . for systems forming",
    "_ stationarily bifurcating _ spatially periodic structures",
    "the dominance of the filaments formed by topological defects is not so strong , and different effects can be expected .",
    "a prototype for such a system might be the high - frequency regime of electroconvection ( ec ) in nematic liquid crystals .",
    "convection patterns with a wavelength @xmath0 which is small compared to the spatial extensions of the sample are easily obtained and sustained over long times by applying a sufficiently high ac voltage ( with a modulation frequency higher than the `` cutoff frequency '' @xmath1 the inverse charge relaxation time ) at plane , parallel ( and transparent ) electrodes enclosing the liquid crystal . however , there is still some discussion on whether the patterns are really three dimensional , i.e.  arising from a bulk instability and forming a laminar structure , or rather parallel rolls located at the electrodes .    closely related to this geometrical question is the question about the mechanism of convection .",
    "the most popular explanation , here called the standard model ( sm ) , is by the dielectric regime of ec _ via _ the carr - helfrich mechanism ( for details , see the references below ) , which is based the leslie - ericksen formulation of nematodynamics .",
    "the sm predicts bulk convection .",
    "it has , on the linear level , been worked out by dubois - violette _ et al . _",
    "later it was modified for square - wave driving voltages @xcite and to include flexoelectric effects @xcite and the effects of finite cell thickness @xcite .",
    "recently it was extended to the nonlinear level @xcite .",
    "but attempts to bring the predictions of the sm ( threshold voltage and critical wave number ) into quantitative agreement with experiments were only partly successful .",
    "the main challenge to the sm is the `` isotropic '' mechanism for ec @xcite , for which the anisotropy of the nematic is only of secondary relevance .",
    "there , ec is driven by inverted charge gradients in thin debye layers near the electrodes , which are not included in the sm .",
    "the `` isotropic '' mechanism naturally leads to boundary convection .",
    "since several material parameters relevant to the `` isotropic '' mechanism are unknown , only semiquantitative predictions of the effect can be made .    in principle , both mechanisms are active , but it is reasonable to assume that one of them dominates . in a recent effort to settle the controversy on bulk _ vs. _  boundary instability , bohatsch and stannarius @xcite developed an experiment with a modified design , which was intended to map the structure across the cell onto the 2d shadowgraph image ( or the diffraction pattern ) of light passing through the cell .    the technique of bohatsch and stannarius was to used samples with a _ twisted _ geometry : just as in tn lcd displays , the anchoring of the nematic director @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) at the upper and lower electrodes ( separation @xmath4 ) is such that @xmath2 is parallel to the layer but the alignment axis of the director at the upper boundary is perpendicular to that at the lower boundary . in the equilibrium configuration",
    "the director is planarly oriented and interpolates between the boundaries with a uniform twist @xmath5 . configurations with positive or negative twist are thinkable .",
    "they are related to each other by a reflection . without loss of generality a negative twist ( @xmath6 ) shall be assumed .",
    "although inversion symmetry is broken in the twisted geometry , there is still the symmetry with respect to a @xmath7 rotation of the cell around the axis of the director at mid plane .",
    "the critical mode at the onset of ec , which breaks the approximate translation symmetry , can be symmetric with respect to this rotation ( perhaps followed by a translation by half a wavelength ) , leading to _ normal rolls _ , or break also this discrete symmetry , then leading to _",
    "oblique rolls_.    in experiments with untwisted cells , the rolls ( or laminae ) observed at the threshold of structure formation in the high - frequency regime are always normal .",
    "thus bohatsch and stannarius conclude by an intuitive argument that , in the twisted cells , the observation of normal rolls at threshold demonstrates a bulk instability , while the observation of oblique rolls is an indicator for a boundary instability , in particular when the rolls are approximately normal to the alignment of @xmath2 at the boundaries .",
    "they observe a transition from normal to oblique rolls as the ac frequency increases .    assuming that the sm is basically correct , sections  [ sec : bulk_modes ] and [ sec : boundary_modes ] of this paper develop the linear theory for the convection pattern in twisted cells , predicting critical modes localized in planes far from or near to the electrodes , respectively , depending on the boundary conditions .",
    "section  [ sec : nonlinear_selection ] sketches the nonlinear effects relevant at the threshold of convection and section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes , in particular with the interpretation of the experiments in the light of the theory .",
    "below the linear theory of high - frequency ec in twisted cells is developed within the framework of the sm .",
    "the association of the obliqueness angle with the position of the convective mode turns out to be correct .",
    "but it is also found that the experimental results for twisted cells can not be transfered to the untwisted cell as it was suggested by bohatsch and stannarius , because the localization of the linear mode , near the boundaries or in the bulk , is enforced by the twist itself .",
    "the calculations are based on the general weakly nonlinear theory  @xcite of dielectric ec in large containers , which has to take the interaction of the convection pattern with several homogeneous soft modes ( hydrodynamic modes ) explicitly into account .",
    "one of these modes is the director orientation .",
    "as follows from the general calculation , a twist does , at lowest order , not excite the other soft modes of the liquid crystal , such as electric potentials or fluid motion , even when the electric ac voltage is applied .",
    "the direct influence of the twist on the convection pattern reduces to a purely geometric effect ( no additional coupling constants not relevant for the untwisted cell are involved ) . the local amplitude and phase of the convection pattern",
    "is expressed by a complex field @xmath8 such that the modulation of actual physical quantities @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the wave number of the convection pattern at threshold in the untwisted cell and @xmath12 is a complex constant .",

    "but in their thinnest and in their thickest cell they find shorter wavelengths . while the deviation in the thin cell can be understood as a breakdown of the 3d amplitude formalism due to large spatial gradients of @xmath13 and @xmath20 , the reason for the deviation in the thick cell is not clear . in agreement with theoretical expectations",
    "the wavelength decreases with increasing frequency .",

    "( [ thin3da ] ) . then @xmath54 and , within the range @xmath55 covered by the critical mode , @xmath56 .",
    "thus , for @xmath55 , the solution  ( [ threshold],[critical_mode ] ) is a physically valid solution of eq .",

    ", in particular b.c .",
    "( [ simple_bc ] ) , are satisfied , provided the boundaries are sufficiently far away .",
    "equations  ( [ threshold],[critical_mode ] ) therefore give a physically valid threshold and critical mode .",
    "next , consider the situation that one of two boundaries , e.g.  the lower one , is near @xmath44 [ i.e.  @xmath58 , the other boundary far away .",
    "then the lower b.c .  becomes @xmath59 while the upper b.c .  remains effectively @xmath60",
    "this eigenvalue problem has to be solved numerically ( after rescaling , it depends only on the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) ; here a shooting method is used .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue @xmath63 as a function of @xmath45 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon]b ( lower curve ) .",
    "as @xmath45 decreases to zero and the maximum of the critical mode approaches the boundary , the gaussian shape of @xmath64 is deformed and the threshold @xmath63 increases monotonically .",
    "in particular one finds @xmath65 , the eigenvalue of the first excitation and lowest antisymmetric mode of the `` harmonic oscillator '' , with the corresponding eigenmode .",
    "excitations near the boundaries have higher thresholds than in the bulk and are inhibited .",
    "thus the theory predicts that in thick enough cells the critical mode is localized within a horizontal layer which covers only a small fraction @xmath66 of the cell .",
    "the orientation of the critical wave vector @xmath38 and the position of the maximum of the critical mode within the sample are coupled , such that @xmath38 is parallel to @xmath2 at the maximum of @xmath64 .",
    "the orientation of the critical wave vector @xmath38 lies between the two orientations of director anchoring at the boundaries .",
    "small angles of order @xmath67 between @xmath38 and director anchoring are forbidden , but otherwise the orientation of @xmath38 with respect to the symmetry axis , i.e.  the obliqueness angle , is undetermined .",
    "one is thus dealing with a _ highly degenerate problem _ with critical wave vectors lying on a circular arc , similar to pattern formation in isotropic systems , where the critical wave vectors lie on a circle .    in thin cells , where @xmath68 , the three - dimensional amplitude equation  ( [ thin3da ] ) is not an accurate description anymore .",
    "but when solved numerically with b.c .",
    "( [ simple_bc ] ) as a qualitative model , it predicts normal rolls in agreement with experiments .    the theoretical analysis for thick cells seems to correspond well with the observations of bohatsch and stannarius in the `` broad '' intermediate frequency range ( within the high - frequency regime ) , where , near onset , the distribution of the wave - vector orientations is `` broad , smeared out , and fluctuating '' @xcite . unfortunately , no experimental raw data for this range have been published , yet , which makes it hard to judge how well defined the maxima of these distributions are , which they _ do _ nevertheless find at small but finite obliqueness angles ( @xmath69 ) , and which are difficult to understand from the theory presented here .",
    "the experimental observation that , for frequencies above the intermediate `` transition range '' , the distribution of the wave vectors near onset becomes narrower with maxima at obliqueness angles near @xmath70 , i.e.  parallel to the surface anchoring , seems to be in contradiction with the theory based on the sm .",
    "a simple explanation , which should be examined experimentally before coming to a final conclusion , would be the combination of two effects .",
    "the first effect is that , at higher frequencies , where the pattern wavelengths are shorter and wave - optical effects have to be taken into account , the optical contrast of the shadowgraph method and the intensity of the reflexes in the optical far field become weaker . as a result ,",
    "the apparent optical threshold of convection could lie slightly above the actual threshold .",
    "wave - optical effects become important at pattern wavelength @xmath0 of the order of magnitude of the geometrical average of the optical wavelength and the thickness of the convective layer @xmath71 @xcite , a condition satisfied in the present case . the second effect",
    "is that the value of the reduced control parameter corresponding to the onset of nontrivial , nonlinear behavior involving homogeneous soft modes scales like @xmath72 or even @xmath73 @xcite , and thus decreases with increasing frequency . in combination of these two trends ,",
    "the observed large obliqueness angles near threshold in thick cells at high frequencies might , in fact , correspond to already fully developed nonlinear effects , such as the chevron pattern . in particular the obliqueness angles above @xmath74 ( ref  @xcite , fig .  11 , @xmath75 ) would then be easier to understand .",
    "but one could also try to explain the observation of preferred obliqueness angles near @xmath70 as a result of some mechanism of wave - vector selection that removes the degeneracy of the problem .",
    "mostly linear selection mechanisms _ via _ perturbations from the boundaries shall be considered here .",
    "nonlinear mechanisms will shortly be discussed in section  [ sec : nonlinear_selection ] .    if there is a linear selection mechanism for large obliqueness angles at threshold , at least one of the tree conditions  ( [ schroedinger],[fixed_bc],[open_bc ] )",
    "must be invalid .",
    "the reason may be found in the truncation errors of the asymptotic expansion which leads to eqs .",

    "the second nonlinear mechanism acts indirectly _ via _ the electric potential . at positions in the sample where @xmath115 is large , additional charge transport processes are active , which effectively increase ( @xmath116 in ref .",

    "consequently , the strength of the electric driving field is reduced where @xmath115 is large and increased where @xmath115 is small , under the constraint that the total voltage drop is constant . but",
    "this effect is typically weak compared to direct nonlinear suppression , and presumably does not change the qualitative properties of the planform selection problem .",
    "it was shown that a twist of the nematic director  or another anisotropy axis in a different system  leads to a localization of the pattern in planes parallel to the director .",
