    "it is traditional to define the habitable zone based on whether liquid water can be maintained on a planet s surface , which is primarily controlled by the planet s surface temperature @xcite .",
    "accurate estimates of the stellar flux boundaries of the habitable zone are critical for estimating parameters of astrophysical interest such as the frequency of earth - like planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the inner edge of the habitable zone is set by the runaway greenhouse effect , a positive feedback through which an entire ocean can be evaporated into the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "our ability to constrain the stellar flux corresponding to the inner edge of the habitable zone has been severely hampered by the inability of 1d radiative - convective models to predict cloud behavior @xcite .",
    "clouds are critical to planetary energy balance .",
    "cloud reflection of solar radiation is responsible for most of the planetary albedo on modern earth @xcite , and clouds also significantly increase earth s greenhouse effect by absorbing terrestrial infrared emission @xcite .",
    "cloud coverage and location are primarily controlled by large - scale atmospheric circulation , which is determined by a variety of factors including stellar flux , orbital parameters , and rotation rate . as the stellar flux increases ,",
    "cloud coverage and thickness may increase , potentially leading to a higher albedo and a negative feedback , or decrease , potentially leading to a lower albedo and a positive feedback .",
    "orbital parameters such as obliquity and eccentricity can both drive large - amplitude seasonal cycles of the atmospheric circulation and surface temperature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they tend to minimally affect the annual - mean climate @xcite .",
    "planetary rotation rate determines the strength of the coriolis force ( the apparent force felt due to the rotation of the planet ) and the length of day ( and night ) .",
    "the coriolis force is a key parameter in determining the atmospheric circulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the coriolis force is strong , thermally direct latitudinal circulations ( hadley cells ) are constrained to low latitudes , and the atmosphere organizes into banded , roughly longitudinally symmetric regions . if the coriolis force is weak , horizontal temperature gradients become small throughout the atmosphere and the hadley cells can extend globally .",
    "the length of day , combined with surface and atmospheric thermal inertia , helps determine the surface temperature distribution , which drives atmospheric circulation @xcite . for a short day ( or large thermal inertia ) , the surface temperature difference between day and night is small .",
    "if the day is long enough that the dayside is much warmer than the nightside , atmospheric circulation is characterized by ascent on the warm dayside and descent on the cold nightside .",
    "recently a number of calculations have been done with 3d general circulation models ( gcms ) to assess the effects of atmospheric circulation , subsaturation , and clouds on the inner edge of the habitable zone @xcite . in the extreme case of",
    "tidally locked synchronously rotating planets orbiting m - stars , strong atmospheric ascent on the dayside leads to thick dayside cloud coverage and a very high planetary albedo @xcite .",
    "this can allow a planet to remain habitable at twice the stellar flux 1d model calculations would suggest . in contrast , for rapidly rotating planets with banded atmospheric circulations , cloud behavior remains roughly similar to modern earth s ( which the albedo of 1d models are tuned to ) so that the inner edge of the habitable zone in 3d models is similar to that in 1d models @xcite .",
    "another interesting difference is that the cloud feedback near the runaway greenhouse threshold appears to be negative for tidally locked planets @xcite and positive for rapidly rotating planets @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a range of planetary rotation rates , between tidally locked and rapidly rotating , and stellar types on cloud behavior and the inner edge of the habitable zone .",
    "to do this we use a 3d gcm with a sophisticated cloud scheme that reproduces cloud behavior well in the large range of climates observed on modern earth .",
    "although we do not push the model significantly outside of this range , it is important to note that cloud modeling is difficult , and other models may yield quantitatively different results .",
    "nevertheless , we focus on results due to robust physical processes that should be qualitatively similar in any 3d model .",
    "our main conclusion is that for all stellar types slowly rotating planets ( orbital period @xmath0100 days or more ) behave similarly to tidally locked planets and have a high planetary albedo near the inner edge of the habitable zone .",
    "the width of the habitable zone is therefore strongly dependent on planetary rotation rate .",
    "for most of the results presented below we use the community atmosphere model version 3.1 , which is a 3d atmospheric general circulation model ( gcm ) that was developed by the national center for atmospheric research to simulate the climate of earth .",
    "cam3 calculates atmospheric circulation and radiative transfer , and uses subgrid - scale parameterizations to model small - scale vertical convection , clouds , and precipitation .",
    "we perform additional simulations in some cases using the community atmosphere model version 4.0 ( cam4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the community climate system model version 3.0 ( ccsm3 , * ? ? ?",
    "ccsm3 is a coupled ocean - atmosphere model that calculates ocean circulation explicitly and uses cam3 as its atmospheric component .",
    "we run cam3 and cam4 coupled to an immobile ocean with a uniform depth and a uniform albedo of 0.06 .",
    "the gcms simulate marine stratus , layered , shallow convective , and deep convective clouds as well as prognostically calculate liquid and ice cloud condensate .",
    "compared to cam3 , cam4 has a revised deep convection scheme and a similar cloud scheme .",
    "the default atmospheric pressure we use is 1.0 bar ( mainly n@xmath1 ) , with co@xmath1=400  ppmv and ch@xmath2=1  ppmv .",
    "we set geothermal heat flux , aerosols , obliquity , and eccentricity to zero .",
    "we run cam3 at a horizontal resolution of 3.75@xmath3@xmath43.75@xmath3 with 26 vertical levels from the surface to @xmath030 km .        in our simulations where we change the rotation rate and increase the stellar flux we use earth s planetary parameters , including radius ( @xmath5 ) , gravity ( @xmath6 ) , and orbital period ( @xmath7 , 365 days ) .",
    "we increase the stellar flux until the model crashes , which occurs when the global mean surface temperature reaches @xmath0310  k. comparison with the clear - sky calculations of @xcite shows agreement between cam3 and generic - lmd to within @xmath05  k up to this temperature .",
    "we use the last converged solution as a proxy for the inner edge of the habitable zone .",
    "we examine a series of rotation periods ( @xmath8 ) ranging from 12 hours to 365 days .",
    "we perform simulations using the sun s spectrum and stellar spectra corresponding to m ( blackbody 3400  k ) , k ( 4500  k ) , and f ( 6800 k ) stars . in our simulations examining a planet with venus orbital characteristics and earth s atmosphere",
    ", we use a stellar flux @xmath9=2615wm@xmath10 , @xmath7=225 days , @xmath8=@xmath11243 days ( retrograde rotation ) , @xmath12=0.95@xmath5 , and @xmath13=0.9@xmath6 .",
    "our default simulation in this case uses earth s continental configuration with continents composed of clay and sand ( albedo=0.2 , thermal conductivity=0.26 wm@xmath14k@xmath14 ) .",
    "for a given stellar flux ( @xmath9 ) , the surface temperature ( ts ) of rapidly rotating planets is much higher than that of slowly rotating planets ( fig .",
    "when we use a surface heat capacity equivalent to 50  m of water ( d=50  m ) , the global - mean ts decreases by 20  k when we increase the rotation period ( @xmath8 ) from 1  day to 256  days , and then decreases by another 25  k when the planet becomes tidally locked ( @xmath8=365  days ) .",
    "the primary reason for this is that the cloud albedo is much higher on slowly rotating planets ( fig .",
    "if we artificially set clouds to zero in the model , ts is nearly independent of rotation rate , except for the tidally locked and nearly tidally locked cases ( fig .",
    "ts is lower in these cases because a thermal inversion on the nighside leads to a radiator fin that cools the planet @xcite .",
    "if we reduce d to 1  m , the ts distribution is able to adjust to the moving stellar forcing so that the planet can behave as if it were tidally locked even when @xmath8 is decreased to 128  days ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "when d=50",
    "m , ts has a maximum at @xmath8=4 days that appears to be associated with a high latitude cloud feedback similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "there is a dramatic difference between the response of the planetary albedo to increases in @xmath9 for rapidly and slowly rotating planets .",
    "for rapidly rotating planets , as @xmath9 increases the planetary albedo first increases , then decreases ( fig .",
    "1d ) , leading to a positive feedback near the runaway greenhouse threshold @xcite .",
    "this positive feedback is due to a combination of decreased cloud reflection and increased water vapor absorption .",
    "in contrast , for slowly rotating planets , the planetary albedo monotonously increases with @xmath9 , leading to a negative feedback that stabilizes the climate .",
    "for rapidly rotating planets , the atmospheric circulation is banded and earth - like .",
    "this leads to high cloud coverage both in a tropical convergence zone associated with the ascent of the hadley cells ( fig .",
    "2e ) and at higher latitudes associated with baroclinic eddies ( fig .",
    "the tropical clouds are most important for planetary albedo because the stellar flux is highest there . as @xmath9 increases , the equator - to - polar temperature gradient decreases ( fig .",
    "2c ) , which weakens the hadley cells @xcite , reduces tropical cloud coverage ( fig .",
    "2c ) , and decreases the planetary albedo ( fig .",
    "1d ) . for slowly rotating planets",
    ", a global atmospheric circulation occurs with strong low - level convergence and ascent in the ( slowly moving ) substellar region ( fig .",
    "2f ) similar to the circulation on synchronously rotating planets @xcite .",
    "this circulation leads to strong convection and optically thick clouds ( fig .",
    "2b ) in the substellar region @xcite .",
    "as @xmath9 increases the circulation weakens , but the zone of ascent spreads out , which leads to a broader area of high relative humidity ( fig .",
    "2h ) and high cloud coverage ( fig .",
    "additionally , the cloud water content increases , making individual clouds optically thicker . as a result ,",
    "the planetary albedo increases with @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "our simulations indicate that the inner edge of the habitable zone is strongly dependent on planetary rotation rate .",
    "numerous discovered exoplanets that were previously considered uninhabitable may be within the habitable zone if they rotate slowly ( fig .",
    "our simulations yield an inner edge of the habitable zone for rapidly rotating planets approximated by the curve @xmath15 and for slowly rotating planets @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are stellar fluxes divided by 1360  wm@xmath10 and @xmath19 is the temperature of the star .",
    "we note that our @xmath17 is slightly larger than that of @xcite , who also use cam3 , but have implemented a more sophisticated radiative transfer scheme , and use different surface boundary conditions , orbital parameters , and trace gas concentrations ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "although the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 estimated using different gcms and assumptions will likely differ by @xmath010% , the robust cloud processes we describe should always make @xmath18 significantly larger than @xmath17",

    "+    our results suggest that a planet at venus distance from a sun - like star could be habitable if it rotated slowly and had an earth - like atmosphere .",
    "we checked this using ccsm3 to simulate the climate a planet like earth would have with venus present orbital parameters and rotation rate ( @xmath8=@xmath11243 days ) .",
    "although the stellar flux is 1.92 times modern earth s , the planetary albedo is 0.65 so that the planet absorbs slightly less radiation than modern earth and the maximum ts is only 306  k ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the slow rotation and consequent stabilizing cloud feedback are the keys to preventing the planet from entering a runaway greenhouse at this high stellar flux .",
    "if either @xmath8 is decreased to 1 day or the clouds are switched off , the model tends toward a runaway greenhouse ( fig .",
    "further simulations show that the planet tends toward a runaway greenhouse if either the day length or the coriolis parameter are changed to be earth - like ( and the other is held constant ) . we have performed a large variety of sensitivity tests that demonstrate the robustness of our conclusion that an earth - like planet in venus orbit would likely be habitable ( table  1 ) .",
    "these ideas could eventually be tested by using the james webb space telescope to look for weak thermal emission at the substellar point ( fig .",
    "4e ) of detected exoplanets @xcite .",
    "our work has important implications for the evolution of venus .",
    "deuterium enrichment in venus atmosphere suggests that it may have started with an ocean and gone through a runaway greenhouse @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that if the runaway happened near the beginning of the solar system , venus would have had to have a rotation period less than a few weeks , and if the runaway occurred recently , venus would have had to have a rotation period less than a few months ( fig .  1 , table  1 ) .",
    "any water would then be photodissociated and lost to space , and large amounts of co@xmath1 would accumulate in the atmosphere since silicate weathering would not occur if there were no surface water @xcite .",
    "tidal interactions could later slow venus rotation rate to its present value @xcite , but it would be too late for venus to return to habitable conditions . if instead all of the water on venus were lost through hydrodynamic escape during formation and venus did not start with oceans @xcite , then the rotation rate would not need to have changed over its history .",
    "consideration of venus shows that slowly rotating planets which our calculations suggest _ could _ be habitable will not actually be habitable in _ all _ cases .",
    "this will depend on whether they started with a rapid rotation rate , if so how long it took for their rotation rate to slow , the rate of water loss if they entered a runaway greenhouse at some point in their history , their ( possible ) migration history , and the timing and amount of volatile delivery , among other things .",
    "this is no different from any previous estimate of habitable zone , since it has always been understood that habitability depends on planetary history in addition to location .",
    "this work demonstrates that the inner edge of the habitable zone for slowly rotating planets could be at twice the stellar flux as for rapidly rotating planets .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the rotation periods of planets at formation could vary between 10 hours and 400 days @xcite , and tidal interactions can further slow planetary rotation @xcite .",
    "it is therefore probable that a large number of planets rotate slowly enough to have a greatly expanded habitable zone .",
    "additionally , our simulations suggesting that an earth - like planet with venus present orbit and rotation rate would be habitable demonstrate that empirical limits on the habitable zone based on solar system planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may not be as strong constraints as previously believed , depending on factors such as rotation rate and planetary history .",
    "finally , we note that although we expect our results to be qualitatively robust , the details will differ with other models that have different cloud and radiation schemes .",
    "we can hope to resolve this issue by comparing gcms , applying cloud resolving models to the problem ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and eventually observing planets using methods such as those suggested by @xcite .    * acknowledgments : * we are grateful to d.  koll , y.  wang , y.  liu , f. ding , c. zhou , and c.  bitz for technical assistance and/or helpful discussions .",
