    "is high compared with that of the superconducting qubit .",
    "the qubit is designed to be insensitive to the major factors that can result in decoherence .",
    "for example , all the energies involved in qubit operation are much lower than the trapping frequency in the longitudinal direction of the trap @xmath202 , which keeps the atoms in the motional ground state during gate operations .",
    "other factors such as the inaccuracy in the raman couplings , the particle loss from the trap and the spontaneous emissions can be well neglected within a time of seconds .",
    "the fluctuation of the number of atoms could induce severe qubit decoherence when the number of atoms is large .",
    "for example , the decoherence rate due to single particle loss grows linearly with @xmath143 and the decoherence rate due to three body collision increases with @xmath203 .",
    "our study shows that for single particle loss process with coupling constant @xmath204 , the decoherence rate at @xmath115 is @xmath205 , and the decoherence due to three body collision can be neglected .",
    "consider for example a single atom loss characterized by a loss rate @xmath206 .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix is described by the following master equation @xmath207 , \\\\",
    "\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\rho^t}{\\partial t}=-\\gamma_0\\displaystyle\\sum_\\alpha \\left ( \\hat{a}_\\alpha^\\dagger\\hat{a}_\\alpha\\rho^t+\\rho^t\\hat{a}_\\alpha^\\dagger\\hat{a}_\\alpha -2\\hat{a}_\\alpha\\rho^t\\hat{a}_\\alpha^\\dagger\\right ) , \\end{array } \\label{density_matrix}\\ ] ] where @xmath208 is the density matrix of the qubit in the interaction picture and the atomic losses in different modes are summed up .",
    "the density matrix can be decomposed into the hilbert spaces of different number of atoms : @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the element of the density matrix with @xmath211 atoms and @xmath212 are qubit states of @xmath211 atoms . substituting this expression into eq .",
    "( [ density_matrix ] ) and assuming an initial density matrix @xmath213 with @xmath143 atoms , we have @xmath214 \\rho^{(n_t)}=\\rho^0 -\\delta t\\gamma_0\\displaystyle\\sum_\\alpha a_\\alpha^\\dagger a_\\alpha\\rho^0 + \\rho^0a_\\alpha^\\dagger a_\\alpha \\\\ \\rho^{(n_t-1)}=+2\\delta t\\gamma_0\\displaystyle\\sum_\\alpha a_\\alpha\\rho^0a_\\alpha^\\dagger \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath215 . starting from @xmath143 atoms in the trap , when one atom leaks out , the qubit state is a superposition of the eigenstates of @xmath216 atoms .",
    "the decoherence rate is slowed down by the fact that the remaining system of @xmath216 atoms largely overlaps with the original qubit states in the @xmath216-atom basis .",
    "the decoherence rate is expressed as @xmath217    numerical results show that @xmath218 grows linearly with number of atoms in the trap as is plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure_7]a .",
    "the decoherence is slowed down by a factor of two by the second term in the above equation . at @xmath115 , @xmath219 . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure_7]a , the dependence of decoherence on the phase of the raman coupling @xmath59 is plotted which is flat in the range of interest .",
    "one of the main decoherence against this qubit is the three - body collision loss .",
    "the three body process : @xmath220 describes that when three atoms collide , two atoms form a bounded molecular state with a binding energy of order of @xmath221 which is several orders larger than the trapping frequency , where @xmath222 is the @xmath51-wave scattering length . as a result ,",
    "the molecule and atom gain very large kinetic energy after the collision and escape from the trap .",
    "this process damages the coherence of the qubit states .",
    "the three - body loss is characterized by @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the three body collision rate in @xcite and @xmath225 gives the dependence on density .",
    "we apply the same approach as that in the single atom loss to calculate the effective decoherence rate and the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure_7]b .",
    "it is shown that @xmath226 grows linearly with @xmath143 and at @xmath115 , with @xmath227 and @xmath228 , we have @xmath229 which gives a very long decoherence time .",
    "we have presented a scheme for implementing an atomic `` flux '' qubit with atomic josephson junctions , which are generated by raman lasers that introduce coupling between internal modes of atoms . by trapping three internal modes and coupling them with the raman pulse ,",
    "a three junction loop is constructed .",
    "the collision interaction between the atoms provides the analog of the capacitance energy . with small number of atoms ,",
    "the qubit presents the main features of the mesoscopic circuit  superconducting flux qubit : the butterfly shaped energy spectrum , the persistent currents and the local wave function in phase basis .",
    "we have outlined methods for the implementation of quantum logic gates with fast switching of raman pulses , the state initialization , and we have presented a qubit measurement scheme by adiabatic switching of the josephson coupling and observation of quantum jumps .",
    "furthermore , we have given detailed analysis of possible imperfection and decoherence of the qubit .",
    "the solid - state qubits suffer severely from noise , which may become the biggest obstacle in implementing those qubits .",
    "however , the solid - state proposals are easy to scale up and control with existing technology . the qubit proposed in this paper",
    "inherits many of the merits of the superconducting qubits .",
    "for one thing , almost all the parameters of the qubit can be very well controlled by external sources which increases the flexibility of qubit .",
    "the system is in principle scalable by storing the atomic flux qubit in wells of the 1d optical lattice .",
    "compared with superconducting qubit , the atomic josephson junction qubit has the advantage of not subjecting to severe environmental disturbance and having a long decoherence time .",
    "hence , an array of the atomic qubits can be arranged in a space to simulate a `` clean '' array of superconducting qubits and perform certain quantum gate operations .",
    "clearly , one of the main differences to the superconducting case is the significantly slower time scale of operations .    in summary",
    ", our study shows that the atomic systems can be designed to be a clean realization of the josephson junction circuits and keep the merits of exploring macroscopic / mesoscopic degrees of freedom and a long decoherence time . in this system",
    ", the josephson couplings can be controlled with large flexibility by adjusting the power and phases of the laser beams .",
    "the collision interaction can also be adjusted in a large range by magnetic - optical means such as tuning around the feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "moreover , the trap geometry and the interaction between neighboring qubits can be chosen to suit different experiments .",
