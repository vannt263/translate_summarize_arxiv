    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : ( 1 ) to give a quick summary of our results on the kobayashi pseudometric on algebraic manifolds , especially on our characterization of those with identically vanishing kobayashi pseudometric that resulted in the introduction of a natural birational invariant and its associated canonical fibration , and ( 2 ) to show that this fibration resolves the conjectured alternative in mori s program that an algebraic variety @xmath0 has a canonical fibration with an orbifold base `` of general type '' ( factoring through the iitaka fibration or any rationally connected fibration of @xmath0 in the birational category ) that has positive dimensional fibers if and only if @xmath0 is not of general type .",
    "+ the author would like to thank j.p .",
    "demailly , a. fujiki , b. shiffman and m. zaidenberg for their keen interest , initiation and guidance in this problem . a very special thanks",
    "is owed to f. campana for his kindness in , among others , communicating his very stimulating preprint for which this paper can only serve to add a few complementary results .",
    "he also expresses his thanks to professors y. i. manin , f. hirzebruch and dr . y. holla for some useful discussions at the max - planck - institute in bonn and finally to y. kawamata and f. bogomolov for their suggestions and encouragements .",
    "since the key objects under study in this paper are all natural bimeromorphic invariants , we assume henceforth that all objects are compact smooth manifolds and that every ( meromorphic ) map , unless otherwise specified , is bimeromorphic to a flat morphism to the target space and that the map is smooth ( of maximal rank ) outside a reduced simple normal crossing divisor , the discriminant locus , on the target manifold",
    ". we can do this by the resolution of singularity theorem and the flattening theorem @xcite .",
    "+ recall that sections , if exist , of powers of a holomorphic line bundle @xmath4 on a compact complex manifold @xmath0 gives rise to a fibration @xmath14 possibly after replacing @xmath0 by a modification .",
    "the kodaira dimension @xmath15 of @xmath4 is defined to be @xmath16 in this case , and to be @xmath17 otherwise .",
    "the general fibers @xmath18 of @xmath19 enjoys @xmath20 .",
    "these definitions generalize to torsion free line sheaves by taking the double dual and to @xmath21-line bundles , which are line bundles tensored by @xmath21-divisors .",
    "we set @xmath22 and call @xmath23 the kodaira dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "the general fibers of @xmath24 have zero kodaira dimension .",
    "a ( meromorphic ) fibration @xmath25 naturally imposes an orbifold structure on @xmath12 . to define it",
    ", we first replace @xmath0 by a modification to make @xmath13 holomorphic . given a reduced irreducible divisor @xmath26 on @xmath12 , we may write @xmath27 for @xmath28 and reduced irreducible divisors @xmath29 in @xmath0 .",
    "then we define the ( minimum ) multiplicity of @xmath13 over @xmath26 by @xmath30 which is independent of the our choice of modification .",
    "we note that the classical multiplicity @xmath31 is defined by replacing @xmath32 above by @xmath33 and is the more natural multiplicity to consider for questions concerning the fundamental group , see @xcite . however , the multiplicity @xmath34 is more natural for our problems as will be indicated in this section .",
    "we define @xmath35 and call the pair @xmath36 an orbifold which we also write as @xmath37 or simply @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath39 is supported on the discriminant locus of @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath40 is a curve , we call a holomorphic map @xmath41 a z - orbifold map to @xmath38 if @xmath42 for all components @xmath26 in @xmath39 .",
    "this gives us the notion of the orbifold kobayashi pseudometric @xmath43 ( define ! ) .    with the above setup , assume that @xmath44 for the general fiber @xmath18 of @xmath13 . then every point in @xmath12 has a neighborhood @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "if moreover , @xmath18 is a rationally connected fibration over a birationally abelian variety , then @xmath47 .",
    "we define the orbifold canonical bundle of @xmath38 by the @xmath21-line bundle @xmath48 , understood as a line bundle on y after a tensor power , and the orbifold kodaira dimension @xmath49 of @xmath50 by @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath52 , then @xmath38 and @xmath13 are said to be of general type .",
    "the usual lemma of castelnuovo - de franchis , as observed by bogomolov ( @xcite , @xcite ) , gives :    [ cd ] @xmath53 let @xmath4 be a saturated line subsheaf of @xmath54 with @xmath0 projective . then    * @xmath55 * if @xmath56 , then @xmath19 defines a fibration from @xmath0 to a projective base @xmath57 of dimension @xmath3 and @xmath58 saturates to @xmath4 in @xmath59 . * more specifically , if @xmath56 , then outside the singularity of the discriminant locus in b , we have @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a divisor given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath21-divisors with equality achieved on every fiber .",
    "the latter implies that @xmath64 so that @xmath65 is an orbifold of general type",
    ".    parts ( i ) and ( ii ) are found in @xcite , but see @xcite for ( ii ) . note that a line sheaf given by ( ii ) and ( ii ) gives rise to a fibration of general type while the converse follows easily from our definition of @xmath66 .",
    "we define @xmath2 to be the maximum @xmath67 for which a line subsheaf @xmath4 of @xmath54 ( the sheaf of holomorphic @xmath3-forms ) exists with @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath0 is said to be special if @xmath68    this invariant was introduced in @xcite as a natural refinement of an invariant @xmath69 given in @xcite .",
    "both were really forced upon us by our respective problems .",
    "indeed , vanishing of @xmath69 coincides precisely with the identical vanishing of the kobayashi metric in all the cases we are able to give a characterization of the latter among projective varieties and this remains true even in the quasiprojective case where the logarithmic version of @xmath69 is used .",
    "the following is quoted from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be an @xmath1-dimensional projective manifold not of general type .",
    "we impose the condition for @xmath9 that @xmath70 and @xmath7 while for @xmath71 , we let @xmath0 be birational to an abelian fibration over a curve or to a rationally connected fibration over any of the above examples .",
    "then @xmath72 if and only if @xmath68",
    "we henceforth restrict to the projective category .",
    "fibrations whose general fibers are special are called special fibrations .",
    "two questions that arise naturally are whether there is a unique line sheaf associated to @xmath2 and whether the fibration(s ) associated with @xmath2 have special fibers .",
    "the answer to both questions has been checked to be in the affirmative for some classes of varieties , including those in the theorem above ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the two questions are indeed related and their affirmative solution follows from the same for the following :    [ conj1 ] let @xmath73 , @xmath74 be fibrations such that @xmath75 is a fibration of general type . if the restrictions of @xmath13 to the general fibers of @xmath76 are also of general type , is @xmath13 then of general type ?",
    "we address this question in @xcite , where we prove the orbifold versions of the theorems proved here . in the case",
    "@xmath13 is the identity map and @xmath77 is of general type , theorems of viehweg ( see @xcite ) , kawamata ( @xcite ) and kollar ( @xcite ) all answered this question in the affirmative .",
    "these theorems are in turn special cases of the c@xmath78 conjecture of iitaka whose orbifold generalization asserts an affirmative answer to the above question .",
    "we prove here the following case of this orbifold c@xmath78 conjecture .",
    "[ cnm ] let @xmath73 and @xmath74 be projective fibrations with @xmath79 of general type .",
    "if @xmath80 for the general fiber @xmath81 of @xmath79 , then @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "this is essentially a direct corollary of the following theorem , which generalizes slightly the results of the people mentioned above . details of this implication can be found in @xcite , which has the version of this theorem via the gcd - defined orbifold base , ( or @xcite ) as given in @xcite .",
    "[ wp ] assume that @xmath25 is a fibration where @xmath84 are projective .",
    "set @xmath85 as @xmath21-line bundles .",
    "let @xmath86 be a positive integer such that @xmath87 is a cartier divisor on @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath88 is weakly positive in the sense of @xcite , defined also in @xcite .    without the orbifold @xmath89 ,",
    "this is the kawamata - viehweg s theorem .",
    "weak positivity is a generalization of the notion of nefness of a vector sheaf over a curve and enjoys the following properties : + ( p1 ) a torsion free coherent sheaf is weakly positive if it contains a weakly positive subsheaf of the same rank .",
    "+ ( p2 ) let @xmath90 be a torsion free coherent sheaf on @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath91 be a flat base change .",
    "if @xmath92 is weakly positive , then so is @xmath90 .",
    "* proof of theorem  [ wp ] * : recall that @xmath93 is a simple normal crossing divisor on @xmath12 . write @xmath94 and let @xmath95 be the least common multiple of @xmath96 .",
    "the kawamata branched covering trick ( @xcite ) guarantees the existence of a finite galois cover @xmath91 with @xmath97 smooth such that @xmath98 for some effective divisor .",
    "we let @xmath99 be the composition @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the base change of @xmath0 by @xmath102 composed with the normalization map , and @xmath103 is a desingularization which is an isomorphism above the smooth locus of @xmath104 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath105 and @xmath106 the resulting pullbacks of @xmath13 by @xmath102 .",
    "note that if @xmath107 , then @xmath108 for some effective divisor @xmath109 by construction .",
    "hence , applying @xmath110 to the @xmath21-divisor @xmath111 renders it into an effective ( integral ) divisor on @xmath112 .",
    "now , a local computation shows the following natural inclusion of torsion free coherent sheaves of the same rank over @xmath97 : @xmath113 a round about way to see this is as follows : this fact without the @xmath114 is well - known ( e.g. , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 13 ) ) .",
    "hence , we only need to check @xmath115 above an analytic neighborhood @xmath116 in @xmath12 of a generic point @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath109 be a component of @xmath118 dominating @xmath119 and let @xmath45 be a small neighborhood in @xmath104 of a generic point @xmath120 on @xmath109 above @xmath3 .",
    "these neighborhoods as @xmath121 varies cover @xmath122 outside a codimension two subset if we include also the open subset @xmath123 , above which @xmath124 and @xmath125 are naturally identical . since @xmath126 on @xmath104 , see the proof of lemma  13 in @xcite , and since @xmath104 is normal , it is sufficient to show that @xmath127 is naturally identified with @xmath124 on @xmath45 , where @xmath128 is as given in part ( ii ) of proposition  [ cd ] .",
    "this identification is easily seen from the fact that , on a neighborhood of @xmath120 , we can write @xmath129 where @xmath130 is obtained from the base change by an @xmath131-cyclic cover @xmath132 of @xmath12 branched precisely on @xmath29 and @xmath133 is obtained from the ( remainder ) cyclic cover of @xmath97 over @xmath132 . let @xmath134 be the map corresponding to @xmath13 . then by construction",
    ", @xmath135 and @xmath136 is smooth on a neighborhood @xmath137 of @xmath138 .",
    "the first implies @xmath139 on @xmath137 while the second implies that @xmath140 on @xmath141 as required for @xmath115 .",
    "combining the theorem of kawamata - viehweg with @xmath115 via ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) now gives us theorem  [ wp ] and hence theorem  [ cnm ] .",
    "@xmath142    by taking @xmath143 in theorem  [ cnm ] , we get the following corollaries .",
    "[ cnm+ ] let @xmath74 be a fibration of general type .",
    "then @xmath144 , where @xmath81 is the general fiber of @xmath79 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath81 is of general type , then @xmath12 is also .",
    "[ sp ] a projective manifold @xmath0 is special if @xmath145 .    *",
    "remark : * we have been notified by campana after this paper appeared as an mpi preprint that he , in the latest versions of his preprint cited here , has also adopted the `` min '' definition for the orbifold base and strengthened his theorems to the same ones given in this section .",
    "due to page limitations , this section will be brief .",
    "we first observe that the general fiber of any fibration has the same @xmath146 as one can deduce from semi - continuity and other facts in the subject ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth projective variety and @xmath147 the union of all irreducible components of the chow scheme @xmath148 whose general points @xmath149 correspond to irreducible reduced special subvarieties @xmath150 of @xmath0 , including the trivial ones .",
    "@xmath147 gives an equivalence relation on @xmath0 where @xmath151 are @xmath147-equivalent if and only if they are contained in a @xmath147-chain ( i.e. , a connected union of finitely many of the @xmath150 s ) .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is @xmath147-connected if all pairs of points in @xmath0 are @xmath147-equivalent .",
    "if @xmath0 is @xmath147-connected , then @xmath0 is special : for if @xmath152 is a fibration of general type , then @xmath147-connectedness gives us a family @xmath153 such that the general @xmath154 identifies with a special subvariety in @xmath0 and that the composition @xmath155 is generically finite , showing that @xmath12 is of general type and hence so are the general fibers @xmath154 , a contradiction .",
    "hence , the construction of campana @xcite , whose notation we also adopt here as ambiguity no longer exists , see also @xcite , gives :              * proof * : the first parts can be found in the references above , so we only need to show parts ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) here . by the assumption of ( 3 ) , @xmath163 so that we have a fibration @xmath164 of general type with positive fiber dimension .",
    "now the general fibers @xmath165 of @xmath0 are not of general type , for otherwise @xmath0 would be of general type by theorem  [ cnm+ ] .",
    "hence we can repeat this process with @xmath165 until we end with a positive dimensional special subvariety through the general point of @xmath0 . for ( 4 )",
    ", we define @xmath146 for an orbifold @xmath166 by the same definition as for @xmath2 except we replace subsheaves of @xmath167 with subsheaves of a canonical locally free subsheaf @xmath168 of @xmath169 ( @xmath112 being a galois cover that kills the orbifold structure of @xmath0 ) invariant under the galois group .",
    "we call x special if @xmath170 . then ( 4 )",
    "follows from the following easily deduced lemma .",
    "see @xcite for more details on these .",

    "this coupled with ( 3 ) solves the mori s alternative stated at the introduction .",
    "also , assuming the standard conjectures in mori s program , which asserts in particular that orbifolds of negative kodaira dimension admits a `` rationally connected '' fibration ( called mori fibration ) with positive dimensional fibers , then lemma  [ s / s ] allows us to deduce that @xmath158 is just the iteration of the orbifold iitaka and mori fibrations that ends at a general type orbifold base , see @xcite for the details ."
