    "in the quest for better wireless connectivity and higher data rates , the cellular network is becoming heterogeneous , featuring multiple types of base stations ( bss ) with different cell size .",
    "heterogeneity implies that the traditional strategies in cell planning , deployment and communication should be significantly revised @xcite .",
    "since the number of bss becomes comparable to the number of devices @xcite and the deployment pattern of the bss is rather irregular , there are multiple bss from which a device can select one to associate with .    the key issue in a wireless heterogeneous setting is the way in which a device selects an access point ( ap ) . the authors in @xcite and @xcite indicate that the ap selected for downlink ( dl ) , termed downlink ap ( dlap ) , is not necessarily the same as the uplink ap ( ulap ) .",
    "the current cellular networks use a criterion applicable to the dl for association in both directions , i.e. a device selects the bs that offers maximal signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) in the dl and then uses the same bs for ul transmission .",
    "when dlap@xmath0ulap , we say that the device has a _ decoupled access_. there are two main drivers for decoupled access : ( 1 ) the difference in signal power and interference in dl as compared to ul @xcite ; and ( 2 ) the difference in congestion between bss @xcite .",
    "decoupled dl / ul access has been considered in @xcite , where the authors devise separate criteria for selection of dlap and ulap , respectively , and demonstrate the throughput benefits by using real - world data from planning tools of a mobile operator . another related work that considers different associations in ul and dl is@xcite , where coverage probability and throughput are analyzed for dynamic tdd networks enhanced with device - to - device ( d2d ) links .",
    "this letter focuses on the analytical characterization of the decoupled access by using the framework of stochastic geometry @xcite .",
    "we use the same association criteria as in @xcite .",
    "we perform a joint analysis of the dl and ul association , using the same realization of the random process that describes spatial deployment of the bss and devices .",
    "the analysis is performed for a two - tier cellular network , consisting of macro bss ( mbss ) and femto bss ( fbss ) .",
    "this is used to obtain the central result of the paper , which is the set of association probabilities for different dl / ul configurations .",
    "the analytical results are closely matching the simulations and provide interesting insights about the decoupled access in terms of e.g. fairness regarding the ul throughput .",
    "combining novel results from this letter with already available results in the literature , we provide an analytical justification of the phenomenon of decoupled access compared to current dl - based association in heterogeneous networks .",
    "the letter is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system model . in section iii , we derive the association probabilities and the average throughput .",
    "section iv gives the numerical results and section v concludes the paper .",
    "we model a two - tier heterogeneous cellular network . the locations of bss",
    "are modeled with independent homogeneous poisson point processes ( ppps ) .",
    "we use @xmath1 to denote the set of points obtained through a ppp with intensity @xmath2 , where @xmath3 for mbss , @xmath4 for fbss and @xmath5 for the devices .",
    "similarly , we use @xmath6 with @xmath7 to denote the transmission power of the node @xmath8 . the variables @xmath9 denote the two - dimensional coordinate of mbs and fbs , respectively . the analysis is performed for a typical device located at the origin , which is the spatial point @xmath10 . by slivnyak",
    "s theorem @xcite , the distribution of a point process in @xmath11 is unaffected by addition of a node at the origin . the power received by a typical device in dl from a bs located at @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the power received by a bs from the typical device in ul is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "these powers are given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are distances from the points @xmath19 and @xmath20 to the origin , respectively , and @xmath21 is the path loss exponent ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath23 is independent exponentially distributed random variable with unit mean , representing rayleigh fading at the point @xmath24 .",
    "each receiver in the system has a constant noise power of @xmath25 .",
    "the dl sinr when the device is associated to @xmath8bs is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 . with the notion of typical point located at the origin , ul sinr is calculated at the location of ulap",
    "this involves calculation of distances between the interfering devices and ulap , which complicates the analysis because none of them is located at the origin .",
    "the problem is solved by using the translation - invariance property of stationary point processes , by which the processes @xmath29 and @xmath30 have the same distribution for all @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "thus , translation of the points for the same value of @xmath32 preserves the process properties .",
    "we use this to shift the points for the distance between the typical device and ulap such that the ulap becomes located at the origin .",
    "the interfering devices are modeled by thinning the ppp @xmath33 in order to take into account that only one device per bs acts as an interferer , using the same resource as the typical device @xcite . by thinning ,",
    "we randomly select fraction of points from the original point process @xcite with probability @xmath34 .",
    "the thinned process is denoted as @xmath35 with density @xmath36 .",
    "the presence of a device in a voronoi cell of a bs forbids the presence of other devices and introduces dependence among the active devices .",
    "however , this dependence is weak , as shown in @xcite , and it is justified to assume independent ppp for the active devices .",
    "the ul sinr at @xmath8bs is defined as : @xmath37",
    "the analysis is divided into two mutually related parts .",

    ", the device is associated to the bs from which it receives the highest average power . in",
    "ul it is associated to bs to which it transmits with the highest average power .",
    "the average power is obtained by averaging over the received signals given by  ( [ dlul_signals ] ) with respect to the fading .",
    "this is justified as the fading - induced variations can lead to ping - pong effects in the association process .",
