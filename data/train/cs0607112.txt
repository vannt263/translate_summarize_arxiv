    "[ tc123],width=288 ]    the result of decoding is also verified at each iteration step for compliance with a codeword : iteration is terminated if a codeword is recovered .",
    "this termination strategy can still give an error , although the probability to confuse actual and a distant codewords is much less than the probability not to recover a codeword for many iterations .",
    "if one neglects the very low probability of the codewords confusion , then the probability of still having a failure after @xmath0 iterations is equal to the integral / sum over the termination curve from @xmath65 and up .",
    "note also that the probability that even infinite number of iterations will not result in a codeword can actually be finite .",
    "discussing fig .",
    "[ tc123 ] one observes two distinct features of the termination probability curve .",
    "first , in all cases the curve reaches its maximum at some relatively small number of iterations .",
    "second , each curve crosses over to an algebraic - like decay which gets steeper with the snr increase .",
    "the emergence of an algebraically extended tail ( that is a tail which does not decay fast ) is not encouraging , as it suggests that increasing the number of iteration will not bring much of an improvement in the iterative procedure .",
    "it also motivates us to look for possibilities of accelerating convergence of the bp algorithm to a minimum of the bethe free energy .",
    "note also the wiggling of termination curves for @xmath66 near the crossover point ( see fig .  [ tc123 ] ) .",
    "it is possibly related to the cycling of the bp dynamics ( and thus the inability of bp to converge ) .",
    "the idea is to introduce relaxational dynamics ( damping ) in an auxiliary time , @xmath67 , thus enforcing convergence to a minimum of the bethe free energy .",
    "one chooses @xmath29 as the main variational field and considers relaxing variational equations eqs .",
    "( [ lbi ] ) according to @xmath68 while keeping the set of remaining variational equations eqs .",
    "( [ norm],[lba],[cons ] ) intact . here",
    "positive parameters @xmath69 have the physical meaning of correlation / relaxation times . performing calculations ,",
    "that are completely equivalent to the ones described in section [ sec : bethe ] , we arrive at the following modified bp equations @xmath70 we are interested to approach ( find ) a solution of the original bp eq .",
    "( [ bp1 ] ) .",
    "one assumes @xmath71 , thus ignoring the second term under @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ qeq ] ) .",
    "the resulting continuous equation is @xmath73 eq .  ( [ iter ] ) represents a simple discretized version of the eq .",
    "( [ bp3 ] ) where the correlation coefficients @xmath69 are chosen to make the coefficient in front of the second term on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bp3 ] ) independent of the bit index , @xmath8 .",
    "then the resulting time dependent coefficient can be rescaled to one by an appropriate choice of the temporal unit ; @xmath74 is the uniform discrete time , @xmath7 is positive integer , @xmath75 ; the left hand side ( right hand side ) of eq.([bp3 ] ) is taken at @xmath76 ( @xmath74 ) and the temporal derivative is discretized in a standard retarded way , @xmath77 .",
    "this choice of relaxation coefficients and discretization , resulted in eq .",
    "( [ iter ] ) , was taken out of consideration in the final formula for simplicity , realizability at all positive @xmath10 and also its equivalence to the standard iterative bp at @xmath78 .",
    "we test the min - sum version ( [ min - sum ] ) of the modified iterative bp with the monte carlo simulations of the @xmath58 $ ] code at few values of snrs .",
    "the resulting termination probability curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ tc ] for @xmath79 .",
    "the simulations show a shift of the probability curve maximum to the right ( towards larger number of iterations ) with the damping parameter decrease however once the maximum is achieved , the decay of the curve at a finite @xmath10 is faster with the number of iterations than in the standard bp case .",
    "the decay rate actually increases as @xmath10 decreases .",
    "( a ) , @xmath80 ( b ) , and @xmath81 ( c ) .",
    "[ tc],width=288 ]     ( a ) , @xmath80 ( b ) , and @xmath81 ( c ) .",
    "[ tc],width=288 ]     ( a ) , @xmath80 ( b ) , and @xmath81 ( c ) .",
    "[ tc],width=288 ]    we conclude that at the largest @xmath0 the performance of a modified iterative bp is strictly better .",
    "however to optimize the modified iterative bp , thus aiming at better performance than given by the standard iterative bp , one needs to account for the trade - off between decreasing @xmath10 leading to a faster decay of the termination probability curve at the largest @xmath0 , but on the other side it comes with the price in the actual number of iteration necessary to achieve the asymptotic decay regime .    the last point is illustrated by fig .  [ er ] , where the decoding error probability depends non - monotonically on @xmath10 .",
    "one can also see that the modification of bp could improve the decoding performance ; e.g. , at @xmath82 and maximally allowed @xmath83 ( after which the decoding unconditionally stops ) the decoding error probability is reduced by factor of about 40 by choosing @xmath84 ( see the bottom curve at fig .",
    "[ er](b ) ) .     for @xmath80 ( a ) and @xmath81 ( b ) .",
    "different curves correspond to different maximally allowed @xmath0 : starting from @xmath85 ( top curve ) and increasing @xmath0 by factor of @xmath86 with each next lower curve .",
    "the points on the right correspond to the standard bp ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "[ er],width=288 ]     for @xmath80 ( a ) and @xmath81 ( b ) .",
    "different curves correspond to different maximally allowed @xmath0 : starting from @xmath85 ( top curve ) and increasing @xmath0 by factor of @xmath86 with each next lower curve .",
    "the points on the right correspond to the standard bp ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "[ er],width=288 ]",
    "we presented a simple extension of the iterative bp which allows ( with proper optimization in the @xmath88 plane ) to guarantee not only an asymptotic convergence of bp to a local minimum of the bethe free energy but also a serious gain in decoding performance at finite @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to their own utility , these results should also be useful for systematic improvement of the bp approximation .",
    "indeed , as it was recently shown in @xcite solution of the bp equation can be used to express the full partition function ( or a - posteriori log - likehoods calculated within map ) in terms of the so - called loop series , where each term is associated with a generalized loop on the factor graph .",
    "this loop calculus / series offers a remarkable opportunity for constructing a sequence of efficient approximate and systematically improvable algorithms .",
    "thus we anticipate that the improved iterative bp discussed in the present manuscript will become an important building block in this future approximate algorithm construction .",
    "we already mentioned in the introduction that our algorithm can be advantageous over other bp - based algorithms converging to a minimum of the bethe free energy mainly due to its simplicity and tunability .",
    "in particular , the concave - convex algorithms of @xcite , as well as related linear programming decoding algorithms @xcite , are formulated in terms of beliefs . on the contrary our modification of the iterative bp",
    "can be extensively simplified and stated in terms of the fewer number of @xmath89 fields each associated with an edge of the factor graph rather than with much bigger family of local code - words .",
    "thus in the case of a regular ldpc code with @xmath90 checks of the connectivity degree @xmath31 one finds that the number of variables taken at each step of the iterative procedure is @xmath91 and @xmath92 in our iterative scheme and in the concave - convex scheme respectively .",
    "having a tunable correlation parameter @xmath93 in the problem is also advantageous as it allows generalizations ( e.g. by turning to a individual bit dependent relaxation rate ) .",
    "this flexibility is particularly desirable in the degenerate case with multiple minima of the bethe free energy , as it allows a painless implementation of annealing as well as other more sophisticated relaxation techniques speeding up and/or improving convergence .",
