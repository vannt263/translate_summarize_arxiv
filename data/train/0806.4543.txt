    "the accretion which built up the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) now hosted in many local galaxies is widely thought to be associated with a sequence of output episodes observed as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . since only a minority ( @xmath12 , see richstone et al .",
    "1998 ) of local galaxies host a currently active agn , the corresponding lifetimes are estimated to be close to @xmath13 yrs .",
    "several observations indicate the accretion episodes to be fundamentally related to the galaxy growth ; one such indication is provided by the narrow scatter in the observed correlation of the smbh mass @xmath14 with its host galaxy mass @xmath15 , when the former is in the range @xmath16 ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 , gebhardt et al .",
    "the emissions of agns thus may conceivably constitute a probe for the history of accretion and growth of smbhs , and for its interplay with the galaxy building process .",
    "the co - evolution of galaxies and agns and their so called `` downsizing '' ( faster evolution for more luminous objects ) depends also on feedback between nuclear and other galactic activities .",
    "in fact , the density of the high luminosity qsos is peaked at high redshift and declines strongly toward us ; similarly , massive galaxies are characterized by a star formation history peaked at high redshifts .",
    "luminous agns are efficient in `` sterilizing '' their massive host galaxies by heating the interstellar matter through winds , shocks , and high energy radiation , see granato et al .",

    "intriguingly , the latter authors found that the bimodal color distribution of galaxies at z@xmath17 can only be explained if agn feedback is considered . in this picture",
    "an agn phase precedes the phase when a galaxy is caught in a passive state with red optical - uv colors , most of the star - formation having been inhibited by the agn activity . indeed , pozzi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) using spitzer photometry found that that a sample of optically obscured qso at z=12 are mainly hosted by red passive galaxies , suggesting a later stage in their evolution .    on the other hand , at low redshift many weak agns have been found in star - forming galaxies ( salim et al .",
    "2007 ) . in these cases",
    "feedback from less powerful agns ( the so - called  radio mode  ) is probably acting to self - regulate accretion and star - formation , and cold gas is left available for both processes for a much longer time ( croton et al .",
    "the same cold gas can intercept the line of sight to the nucleus .",
    "indeed , compton - thin absorbers ( with column densities @xmath18 @xmath7 ) may well be located in the galactic disk ( malkan , gorjian , tam 1998 ; matt 2000 ; see also ballantyne , everett , murray 2006 ) .",
    "therefore a natural expectation in this scenario is the fraction of obscured agns to be large at low agn luminosities .",
    "it is well known since the pioneering work done with the _ einstein _ satellite ( lawrence & elvis 1982 ) and with optically and radio - selected agns ( lawrence 1991 ) that this fraction strongly decreases with increasing agn luminosity ( see ueda et al .",
    "2003 ; la franca et al . 2005 ; gilli , comastri , hasinger 2007 ; triester , krolik , dullemond 2008 ; hasinger 2008 ) .",
    "a widely shared view holds that the luminosity dependence of the obscured fraction is related to the energy fed back by the agns onto the surrounding gas that constitutes the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "given that the agn emission is proportional to the fraction of such a gas available for accretion , a _ positive _ correlation between luminosity and absorption would be expected instead in the absence of an energy feedback depleting the ism after the onset of the agn activity .",
    "a mounting body of observations cogently indicates that strong nuclear feedback is present in galaxies hosting agns ( see for a review elvis 2006 and references therein ) . on small ( sub - pc ) scales ,",
    "the observed x - ray absorption lines indicate the presence of outward winds with velocities up to some @xmath19 km / s ( weymann 1981 ; turnshek et al .",
    "1988 ; creenshaw et al . 2003 ;",
    "chartas et al . 2002 ; pounds et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ; risaliti et al .",
    "these likely originate from the acceleration of disk outflows due to the agn radiation field ( proga 2007 and references therein ) . on larger scales , broad absorption lines in about 10% of optically luminous qsos indicate fast outflows ( up to 30,000 km / s ) .",
    "massive ( 10 - 50 @xmath20 ) flows of neutral gas with speed @xmath21 km / s are observed through 21-cm absorption of radio - loud agns ( see morganti , tadhunter , oosterloo 2005 ) , indicating that agns have a major effect on the circumnuclear gas in the central kiloparsec region around agns . on even larger scales of some @xmath22 kpc ,",
    "the presence of agn - induced outflows is revealed by x - ray observations of the intra - cluster medium ( see mcnamara & nulsen 2007 for a review ) showing cavities and expanding shocks with mach numbers ranging from @xmath23 to @xmath24",
    ". how the outflows produced in the innermost regions of the active galaxies are transported outwards to affect such large scales is still matter of investigation ; buoyant bubbles ( see reynolds , heinz & begelman 2001 , churazov 2001 ) and expanding blast waves ( see cavaliere , lapi & menci 2002 ; lapi , cavaliere & menci 2005 ) constitute viable mechanisms for such a transport .",
    "nuclear obscuration is directly linked to agn feedback , since the same gas ( and dust ) which feed the agn output may well be responsible for its obscuration .",
    "therefore , modelling agn obscuration is essential to connect the observed agn properties to the accretion history of smbhs over cosmological time .",
    "this is a significant theoretical challenge as it requires not only connecting the agn evolution to the galaxy formation and growth , but also implementing in a model a self - consistent description of the agn feedback on the galactic gas .",
    "indeed , very few attempts have been carried out in this direction so far .",
    "an attempt to include agn absorption into an _ ab initio _ galaxy formation model has been proposed by nulsen & fabian ( 2000 ) , by relating both the smbh fueling and the agn absorption to the cooling flows associated with the hot gas pervading the growing dark matter haloes , but this assumption did not lead to a full description of the statistical distribution of qso luminosity .    here we develop our semi - analytic model of hierachical galaxy formation and agn evolution ( see menci 2006 ) to self - consistently include the absorption of agns , with the aim of investigating the cosmic evolution of the latter and its dependence on agn properties like luminosity and redshifts .",
    "the model is suited to our scope as it includes a detailed treatment of the feedback on the interstellar gas .",
    "our aim is to investigate the dependence of agn _ absorption _ on luminosity @xmath25 and redshift @xmath26 arising in hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios that include an effective description of the evolution of agns and of their feedback .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we describe our model for galaxy formation and the associated agn evolution .",
    "3 is focussed on describing our treatment of the agn feedback onto the interstellar gas and its effects on the agn absorption . in sect .",
    "4 we test our feedback - inclusive model for agn evolution by comparing its outcomes with the redshift distribution of the number density of agns for different x - ray luminosities . our results on the luminosity and redshift dependence of the absorbed fraction of agns are shown and discussed in sect .",
    "6 is devoted to summarize our conclusions .",
    "the semi - analytic model we develop and use connects , within a cosmological framework , the accretion onto smbhs and the ensuing agn activities with the evolution of galaxies .",
    "galaxy formation and evolution is driven by the collapse and growth of dark matter ( dm ) haloes , which originate by gravitational instability of overdense regions in the primordial dm density field .",
    "this is taken to be a random , gaussian density field with cold dark matter ( cdm ) power spectrum within the  concordance cosmology \" ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) for which we adopt round parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , baryonic density @xmath29 and hubble constant ( in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) @xmath30 .",
    "the normalization of the spectrum is taken to be @xmath31 in terms of the variance of the field smoothed over regions of 8 @xmath32 mpc .    as cosmic time increases , larger and larger regions of the density field collapse , and",
    "eventually lead to the formation of groups and clusters of galaxies ; previously formed , galactic size condensations are enclosed . in closer detail ,",
    "the process implies not only smooth mass inflow , but also merging and coalescence of smaller condensations .",
    "the corresponding merging rates of the dm haloes are provided by the extended press & schechter formalism ( see bond et al . 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "the clumps included into larger dm haloes may survive as satellites , or merge to form larger galaxies due to binary aggregations , or coalesce into the central dominant galaxy due to dynamical friction ; these processes take place over timescales that grow longer over cosmic time , so the number of satellite galaxies increases as the dm host haloes grow from groups to clusters .",
    "all the above processes are implemented in our model as described in detail in menci et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) , based on canonical prescriptions of semianalytic modeling .",
    "the radiative gas cooling , the ensuing star formation and the supernova events with the associated feedback occurring in the growing dm haloes ( with mass @xmath33 and circular velocity @xmath34 ) are described in our previous papers ( e.g. , menci et al .",

    "the gas gradually condenses into stars at a rate @xmath41 ; the stellar ensuing feedback returns part of the cooled gas to the hot gas phase with mass @xmath42 at the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "an additional channel for star formation implemented in the model is provided by interaction - driven starbursts , triggered not only by merging but also by fly - by events between galaxies ; such a star formation mode provides an important contribution to the early formation of stars in massive galaxies , as described in detail in menci et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "the model also includes a treatment of smbhs growing at the centre of galaxies by interaction - triggered inflow of cold gas , following the physical model proposed by cavaliere & vittorini ( 2000 ) and implemented in menci et al .",
    "the accretion of cold gas is triggered by galaxy encounters ( both of fly - by and of merging kind ) , which destabilizes part of the cold gas available by inducing loss af angular momentum .",
    "in fact , small scale ( 0.1-a few @xmath43 ) regions are likely to have disk geometry if they are to efficiently remove angular momentum and convey to the ( unresolved ) pc scales the gas provided on larger scales ( these may be isotropized by head - on , major merging events ) .",

    "actually , two kinds of feedback are at present implemented in this context : on the one hand , models based on galaxy interactions as triggers of agn activity and feedback relate the latter to the bright , accretion phase onto supermassive black holes , i.e. , to the same phase corresponding to agn activity ( see menci et al . 2003 , 2007 ; di matteo et al . 2005 ; hopkins et al .",

    "croton et al .",
    "since the latter mode would result into a feedback activity continuing down to low redshift , we expect such models to provide a much milder dependence of agn absorption on redshift ; so observational results on the high - redshift absorption of agn emission will constitute an effective test for models of agn feedback .    finally , we note that the feedback related to the active agn phase described here is effective to decrease the galactic gas and the associated absorption mainly at low redshift @xmath145 and for bright ( @xmath196 erg / s ) agns ( see , e.g. , cavaliere & menci 2007 ) .",
    "this implies that at high redshifts the effective cooling and the continuous replenishing of galactic gas due to fequent merging events will override the depletion due to the agn feedback , so the latter can not suppress the early growth of supermassive bh .",
    "indeed , the predicted number density of early ( @xmath197 ) , bright ( @xmath198 erg / s ) agns shown in fig . 2 is consistent with that observed for bright ( @xmath199 ) optical qsos up to @xmath200 ( hopkins et al .",
