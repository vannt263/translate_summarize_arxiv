    "the theme of fluctuations in finite systems of harmonic oscillators emerges naturally in both application and theory . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the study of the stochastic dynamics of a tagged degree of freedom in finite harmonic systems provides a valuable illustration , and often more than that , of the role of the thermodynamic and weak - coupling limits , ergodicity , thermalization , recurrences , synchronization , and other basic concepts in nonequilibrium phenomena  @xcite .",
    "another relevant area is langevin dynamics generated by a coupling to a finite harmonic bath(s ) , and its application to mesoscopic systems and networks ; see @xcite .    being nonergodic , the capability of harmonic systems to illustrate general phenomena in statistical mechanics might seem doubtful at first glance . by means of a canonical transformation",
    "a harmonic system of any size can be transformed into a collection of independent oscillators , or normal modes ; since the energies of normal modes are the integrals of motion , a single isolated harmonic system does not equilibrate and is not very interesting from the point of view of statistical mechanics .",
    "a more fruitful approach is to consider an _",
    "ensemble _ of harmonic systems , assuming that in the past they were in contact with a larger thermal bath in equilibrium at a given temperature , and that the initial normal modes of the ensemble are distributed according to the canonical distribution . within this framework ,",
    "one evaluates statistical averages of dynamical variables over the ensemble of the system s initial coordinates rather than over time .",
    "such averages show the transition of the ensemble to thermal equilibrium in the limit of a large number of particles , and thus the nonergodic nature of harmonic systems does not explicitly manifest itself , and for most cases is inessential .",
    "it should however be stressed that this framework , which is standard for most works on stochastic dynamics of harmonic systems both classical and quantum , assumes a very special type of coupling between the system and the external thermal bath : this coupling justifies the initial conditions for the the system s degrees of freedom , yet is assumed to be sufficiently weak , or completely turned off , as not to affect the system s further dynamics .",
    "the inequivalence for harmonic systems of ensemble- and time - averages , together with the almost exclusive exploitation in literature of the former , does not necessarily entail that the latter are inadequate .",
    "rather , we introduce in this paper a new class of time - average correlations ( we call these _ secondary _ correlations ) which characterize recurrences in finite harmonic systems . for systems of same - mass particles ,",
    "these correlations are shown to be very close , and under certain conditions exactly identical , to the conventional ( primary ) time correlations defined with ensemble averaging .",
    "this implies that for finite nonergodic systems , the use of both ensemble and time averages may give meaningful complementary descriptions , and that correlations with the two types of averaging may be related in some subtle way .",
    "consider the temporal autocorrelation function @xmath1 of a dynamical variable @xmath2 in a finite system of size @xmath3 - typically , such a function exhibits two distinctive regimes , separated by a crossover time @xmath4 of order @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the speed of signal propagation in the system .",
    "for short times @xmath7 , the variable does not feel the presence of the boundaries , and the correlation function decays in a smooth regular way , following the same laws as for an infinitely large system . on the other hand , for longer times @xmath8 the dynamics of the variable",
    "are affected by signals reflected from the boundaries . for long time regimes such as this , rather than decaying smoothly the correlation functions may exhibit erratic , apparently noisy , behavior  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] by way of the normalized momentum correlation function for the central particle in a harmonic chain with fixed ends .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath9 which describes @xmath10 linearly coupled particles indexed @xmath11 with terminal particles fixed , with displacement @xmath12 .",
    "assuming @xmath13 is odd , the middle particle indexed @xmath14 has normalized ( @xmath15 ) momentum correlation function @xmath16 where the prime indicates that the summation is only over odd @xmath17 . in this expression",

    "the correlation function @xmath22 is very close to that of an infinite chain , given by the bessel function @xmath23 this can be readily justified by approximating the sum ( [ c ] ) with an integral , and recognizing the latter as the well - known integral representation of @xmath24 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "more interesting from the perspective of this paper is the regime @xmath8 in which the correlation @xmath22 becomes irregular , see fig .",
    "it can be shown that the function @xmath22 given by ( [ c ] ) belongs to the class of almost periodic functions : any value @xmath25 which the function achieves once is achieved again , infinitely many times .",
    "traditionally , such functions are characterized by the average frequency with which they return to @xmath25 , or by the reciprocal , i.e.  the mean recurrence time @xmath26 . for correlations of type ( [ c ] ) with large @xmath13 ,",
    "the famous result for the recurrence time , first obtained by kac  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , @xmath27 implies that recurrences of order @xmath28 or larger are exponentially rare .",
    "this result resolves , or rather ( being derived for a model system ) shows the direction of resolution for the paradoxes of irreversibility  @xcite .     for the central particle ( @xmath29 ) of the harmonic chain with fixed ends with hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with @xmath30 , given by eq .",

    "namely , observing that for large @xmath33 the correlation function @xmath22 appears to behave like stationary noise , we are encouraged to characterize it by a new correlation function @xmath34 defined with the time average @xmath35 since we are only interested in the interval @xmath8 when @xmath22 behaves irregularly , one might prefer to set the lower integration limit in definition ( [ d2 ] ) to @xmath4 instead of zero .",
    "however this would only be an unnecessary complication , as the limit @xmath36 makes the two definitions numerically equivalent ( assuming always that the integral from @xmath37 to @xmath4 converges ) .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath38 , defined by relations ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) , as the secondary correlation function , and call @xmath22 the primary one .",
    "we would like to promote the secondary correlation @xmath38 as a meaningful statistical tool for characterizing the distribution of recurrences times in a system of finite size .",
    "such information is not contained in the kac formula  ( [ kac ] ) for the average recurrence time @xmath39 , so the two functions @xmath26 and @xmath38 do not duplicate each other but describe recurrences in complementary ways .",
    "since the primary and secondary correlations @xmath22 and @xmath38 characterize recurrences at different levels and are defined using different types of averaging ( over ensemble and time , respectively ) , the existence of any specific relation between them is perhaps _ a priori _ unexpected . yet a simple numerical experiment with eqs .",
    "( 1 - 6 ) suggests , for the middle atom of a chain with fixed ends , the equality @xmath40 closer scrutiny reveals that the equality is exact and holds for any @xmath33 , such that the secondary correlation completely repeats the structure of the primary one for both regular ( @xmath7 ) and noisy ( @xmath41 ) domains and has the same crossover time @xmath4 .",
    "the proof follows immediately from the relation @xmath42 which holds for an arbitrary spectrum of ( nonzero ) normal mode frequencies @xmath43 and can be verified by direct evaluation ( with the help of lhospital s rule ) . for @xmath44 this",

    "( [ c ] ) . in general this , of course , is not the case .",
    "for example , for a chain with fixed ends described by the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , the normalized momentum correlation function for particle with arbitrary index @xmath54 has the form ( see appendix ) @xmath56 for the middle particle @xmath57 this is reduced to ( [ c ] ) , whereas for the other particles normal modes enter the expression ( [ c_gen ] ) with different amplitudes @xmath58 .",
    "as one can immediately verify , the exact equality of primary and secondary correlations does not hold in these cases .",
    "an important example when this equality does hold for _ any _ particle is a harmonic chain with periodic boundary conditions . in this case",
    "the momentum correlation for each particle is a superposition of equally weighted normal modes  @xcite @xmath59 and repetition of the above derivation leads again to the exact equality @xmath60 for any particle of the system .",
    "so far , even with the above examples of its validity , the equality of primary and secondary correlations may appear as no more than a curious coincidence . however , further numerical exercises reveal that even when equality does not hold exactly , it remains a very good approximation for the initial time interval @xmath61 , see fig .",

    "one can observe that for large @xmath13 and @xmath54 not too close to the end or to the middle of the chain the coefficients @xmath70 are nonzero only for large indices @xmath71 .",
    "for instance , for the chain with @xmath30 and the particle @xmath49 , coefficients @xmath70 are nonzero only for @xmath75 as a result , for @xmath33 not too large in the expression ( [ d3 ] ) , the dominating contribution comes from the first term @xmath24 , while the corrections given by the sum @xmath76 involve bessel functions of large orders which are negligibly small for a significant time interval @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the above consideration not only justifies the equality @xmath77 for @xmath61 , but also accounts for a curious non - monotonic dependence of @xmath53 on the tagged particle index @xmath54 , which we noticed empirically in fig .  2 .",
