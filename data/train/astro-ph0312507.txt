    "disks dominated by external torques ( e.g. a magnetohydrodynamic [ mhd ] wind ) can have higher accretion rates ( but not arbitrarily higher ; see @xcite ) while avoiding gravitational instability .    for a young",

    "disks may not be this cold if the star is located in a warm molecular cloud where the ambient temperature is greater than @xmath24 , or if the disk is bathed in scattered infrared light from the central star ( although there is some evidence for such low temperatures in the solar nebula , e.g. @xcite ) . if the vertically - averaged value of @xmath25 is small and internal dissipation is confined to surface layers , as in the layered accretion model of @xcite , then instability can occur at higher temperatures , although equation ( [ thickcrit ] ) still requires that the disk be massive .",
    "agn disk heating is typically dominated by illumination from a central source .",
    "the temperature then depends on the shape of the disk .",
    "if the disk is flat or shadowed , however , and transport is dominated by internal torques , one can apply equation ( [ instcrit ] ) .",
    "for example , in the nucleus of ngc 4258 @xcite the accretion rate may be as large as @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "one of us investigated the effect of gravitational instability in cooling , gaseous disks in a local model .",

    "the initial conditions at a radius corresponding to the minimum initial value of q ( @xmath33 ) for these simulations were @xmath34 ; the initial cooling time under these circumstances is @xmath35 , so fragmentation is not expected and is not observed .",

    "the gravitational potential is determined by the razor - thin disk poisson equation : @xmath68 for a single fourier component of the surface density @xmath69 this has the solution @xmath70 a finite - thickness disk has weaker self - gravity , but this does not qualitatively change the dynamics of the disk in linear theory @xcite .",

    "we have also checked the dependence of the outcome on @xmath75 and found that the outcome is insensitive to @xmath75 , at least for the models with @xmath76 that we use .",
    "our cooling function is determined from a one - zone model for the vertical structure of the disk .",
    "the disk cools at a rate per unit area @xmath77 which defines the effective temperature @xmath78 .",
    "the cooling function depends on the heat content of the disk and how that content is transported from the disk interior to the surface : by radiation , convection , or perhaps some more exotic form of turbulent transport such as mhd waves .",
    "low temperature disks are expected to be convectively unstable ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite has argued , however , that the radiative heat flux in an adiabatically - stratified disk is comparable to the heat dissipated by turbulence ( in an @xmath25-disk model ) , suggesting that convection is incapable of radically altering the vertical structure of the disk .",
    "we will consider only radiative transport .",
    "if the disk is optically thick in the rosseland mean sense , so that radiative transport can be treated in the diffusion approximation , then @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the rosseland mean optical depth and @xmath43 is the central temperature .",
    "we will assume that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 which follows from the equation of state and the assumption that the radiation pressure is small ( we have verified that this is never seriously violated ) . here",
    "@xmath84 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath85 is the proton mass , and @xmath86 is the mean mass per particle , which we have set to @xmath87 in models with initial temperature below the boundary between the grain - evaporation opacity and molecular opacity and @xmath88 in models with initial temperature above the boundary .",
    "the optical depth is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the rosseland mean opacity , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are local density and temperature , and @xmath93 is the height above the midplane . following the usual one - zone approximation , @xmath94 where the overbar indicates a suitable average and @xmath95 is the disk scale height ( we ignore the effects of self - gravity on the disk scale height , which is valid when locally @xmath96 ) .",
    "taking @xmath97 and @xmath98 then gives a final , closed expression for @xmath29 .",
    "we have adopted the analytic approximations to the opacities provided by @xcite .",
    "these opacities are dominated by , in order of increasing temperature : grains with ice mantles , grains without ice mantles , molecules , h@xmath99 scattering , bound - free / free - free absorption and electron scattering .",
    "the molecular opacity regime is commonly called the _ opacity gap _ ; it is too hot for dust , but too cold for h@xmath99 scattering to contribute much opacity .",
    "the opacity can be as much as @xmath100 orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath101 typical of the dust - dominated opacity regime .",
    "it turns out that this feature plays a significant role in the evolution of gravitationally - unstable disks .    to sum up",
    ", the cooling function is @xmath102 for a power - law opacity of the form @xmath103 , this implies that @xmath104 from this it follows that the cooling time @xmath105 scales as @xmath106 if the disk evolves quasi - adiabatically ( as it does if the cooling time is long compared to the dynamical time ) then @xmath107 and @xmath108 table 1 gives a list of values for this scaling exponent for our nominal value of @xmath65 .",
    "notice that , when ice grains or metal grains are evaporating , and in the bound - free / free - free opacity regime , cooling time _ decreases _ as surface density _ increases_.    our cooling function is valid in the limit of large optical depth ( @xmath109 ) . since the disk becomes optically thin at some locations in the course of a typical run , we must modify this result so that the cooling rate does not diverge at small optical depth .",
    "a modification that produces the correct asymptotic behavior is @xmath110 this interpolates smoothly between the optically - thick and optically - thin regimes and is proportional to the ( rosseland mean ) optical depth in the optically - thin limit . while it would be more physically sensible to use a planck mean opacity in the optically - thin limit ,",
    "usually the optically - thin regions contain little mass so their cooling is not energetically significant .",
    "an exception is in the opacity gap , where even high density regions become optically thin .",
    "our simulations begin with @xmath10 and @xmath59 constant .",
    "the velocity field is perturbed from the equilibrium solution to initiate the gravitational instability .",
    "the initial velocities are @xmath111 , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is a gaussian random field of amplitude @xmath114 .",
    "the power spectrum of perturbations is white noise ( @xmath115 ) in a band in wavenumber @xmath116 surrounding the minimum @xmath117 ( with @xmath118 ) in the density - wave dispersion relation .",
    "we have checked in particular cases that for @xmath119 the outcome is qualitatively unchanged .",
    "this is expected because disk perturbations ( unlike cosmological perturbations ) grow exponentially and the initial conditions are soon forgotten .    excluding the initial velocity field , the initial conditions for a spatially - uniform disk consist of three parameters : @xmath120 , and @xmath1 .",
    "we fix @xmath5 , leaving two degrees of freedom . in models with simple ,",
    "scale - free cooling functions such as that considered by @xcite , these degrees of freedom remain and can be scaled away by setting @xmath121 .",
    "that is , there is a two - dimensional continuum of disks ( with varying values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but the same value of @xmath28 ) that are described by a single numerical model .",
    "the opacity contains definite physical scales in density and temperature .",
    "the realistic cooling function considered here therefore removes our freedom to rescale the disk surface density and rotation frequency .",
    "that is , there is now a one - to - one correspondence between disks with fixed @xmath10 and @xmath1 and our numerical models .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as labels for the parameter space is not unique . internally in the code we fix the initial volume density ( in @xmath122 ) and the initial temperature ( in kelvins ) .",
    "these choices are difficult to interpret , however , since they are tied to quantities that change over the course of the simulation ; @xmath1 and the mean value of @xmath10 do not .    the cooling is integrated explicitly using a first - order scheme .",
    "the timestep is modified to satisfy the courant condition and to be less than a fixed fraction of the shortest cooling time on the grid .",
    "we have varied this fraction and shown that the results are insensitive to it , provided that it is sufficiently small .",
    "consider the evolution of a single `` standard '' run , with @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",

    "after the initial phase of gravitational instability the model settles into a statistically - steady , gravito - turbulent state .",
    "it does not fragment .",
    "cooling is balanced by shock heating .",
    "energy for driving the shocks is extracted from the shear flow , and the mean shear flow is enforced by the boundary conditions .",
    "the turbulent state transports angular momentum outward via hydrodynamic and gravitational shear stresses .",
    "the dimensionless gravitational shear stress is @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the gravitational acceleration , and the dimensionless hydrodynamic shear stress is @xmath135 where @xmath136 denote a spatial average .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of @xmath137 and @xmath138 in the standard run .",
    "averaged over the last @xmath139 of the run , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and so the total dimensionless shear stress is @xmath142 , where @xmath143 denote a space and time average .    the mean stability parameter @xmath144 averages @xmath145 over the last @xmath139 of the run .",
    "because the temperature and surface density vary strongly , other methods of averaging @xmath28 will give different results .",
    "figure 3 shows a snapshot of the surface density at @xmath146 .",
    "the structure is similar to that observed in @xcite , with trailing density structures .",
    "the density structures are stretched into a trailing configuration by the prevailing shear flow .",
    "their scale is determined by the disk temperature and surface density rather than the size of the box ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we now turn to exploring the two - dimensional parameter space of models .",
    "first consider a series of models with the same initial central temperature , but with varying @xmath4 .",
    "as @xmath4 is lowered the time - averaged gravitational potential energy per unit area @xmath147 increases monotonically in magnitude .",
    "the gravito - turbulent state becomes more extreme , with larger @xmath148 , larger perturbed velocities , and larger density contrasts .",
    "eventually a threshold is crossed and the disk fragments .",
    "fragmentation is illustrated in figure 4 , which shows a snapshot from a run with @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",

    "a snapshot of the optical depth at the same point in the simulation is given in figure 5 .",
    "for each snapshot , red indicates high values of the mapped variable and blue indicates low values .",
    "much of the disk is optically thick , but most of the low density regions are optically thin in the rosseland mean sense .",
    "lowering @xmath4 sufficiently always leads to fragmentation .",

    "quantitatively , we define this as the point at which the time - averaged gravitational potential energy per unit area is equal to @xmath155 .",
    "is the potential energy per unit area of a wave at the critical wavelength in a @xmath5 disk with @xmath156 .",
    "no bound objects are observed throughout the duration of these runs . ]",
    "the lower line shows the most slowly cooling simulations to show definite fragmentation ( _ fragmentation point _ ) .",
    "quantitatively , we define this as the point at which the gravitational potential energy per unit area is equal to @xmath157 _ at some point during the run_. figure 6 shows the data in the @xmath158 plane , while figure 7 shows the results in the @xmath159 plane .",
    "the light contours are lines of constant @xmath4 .",
    "the transition from persistent , gravito - turbulent outcomes to fragmentation is gradual and statistical in nature .",
    "figure 8 shows the gravitational potential energy per unit area in the transition region for a series of runs with @xmath160 .",
    "the abscissa is labeled with the initial cooling time @xmath161 .",
    "there is a gradual , approximately logarithmic increase in the magnitude of @xmath147 as @xmath4 decreases .",
    "runs in this region exhibit the transient formation of small bound objects , which might collapse if additional physics ( e.g. the effects of mhd turbulence ) were included in the model .",
    "eventually @xmath162 begins to increase dramatically , and we define the _ transition point _ as the beginning of this steep increase in gravitational binding energy .",
    "figure 9 shows the run of @xmath161 for the fragmentation point , transition point , and nonfragmentation point as a function of @xmath163 .",
    "it is surprising that a disk can begin to exhibit signs of gravitational collapse for @xmath161 as large as @xmath164 , and evade collapse for @xmath161 as small as @xmath165 .",
    "a naive application of the results of @xcite would suggest that fragmentation should occur for @xmath32 . evidently this estimate can be off by orders of magnitude , with the largest error for @xmath166 , just below the opacity gap .",
    "the physical argument for fragmentation at short cooling times is as follows ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thermal energy is supplied to the disk via shocks .",
    "strong shocks occur when dense clumps collide with one another ; this occurs on a dynamical timescale @xmath167 .",
    "if the disk cools itself more rapidly then shock heating can not match cooling and fragmentation results .",
    "this argument is apparently contradicted by figure 9 .",
    "the resolution lies in finding an appropriate definition of cooling time .",
    "the disk loses thermal energy on the effective cooling timescale @xmath168 figure 10 shows the run of @xmath3 at the fragmentation , transition , and non - fragmentation points .",
    "evidently @xmath3 at transition lies between @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "figure 11 shows the run of @xmath4 and @xmath3 on the transition line . just below the opacity gap they differ by as much as four orders of magnitude .",
    "why do @xmath4 and @xmath3 differ by such a large factor ?",
    "the answer is related to the existence of sharp variations in opacity with temperature .",
    "consider a disk near the lower edge of the opacity gap . once gravitational instability sets in , fluctuations in temperature move parts of the disk into the opacity gap .",
    "there , the opacity is reduced by orders of magnitude .",
    "since the cooling rate for an optically thick disk is proportional to @xmath171 , the cooling time drops by a similar factor .",
    "relatively small variations in temperature can thus produce large variations in cooling rate .    as in @xcite",
    ", the result @xmath172 also implies a constraint on @xmath148 .",
    "energy conservation implies that @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the total shear stress ( hydrodynamic plus gravitational ) .",
    "equivalently , stress by rate - of - strain is equal to the dissipation rate . using the definition of @xmath3",
    ", this implies @xmath175 hence @xmath172 implies @xmath176 .",
    "figure 12 shows @xmath148 vs @xmath3 for a large number of runs plotted against equation ( [ analpha ] ) .",
    "for small values of @xmath3 the numerical values lie below the line .",
    "these models are not in equilibrium ( i.e. , not in a statistically - steady gravito - turbulent state ) , so the time average used in equation ( [ avgsol ] ) is not well defined . for larger values of @xmath3 numerical results typically ( there is noise in the measurement of both @xmath148 and @xmath3 because the time average is taken over a finite time interval ) lie slightly above the analytic result .",
    "the bias toward points lying slightly above the line reflects the fact that @xmath148 measures the rate of energy extraction from the shear while @xmath3 measures the rate at which that energy is transformed into thermal energy .",
    "if energy is lost , perhaps to numerical averaging at the grid scale , then more energy must be extracted from the shear flow to make up the difference .",
    "overall , however , the agreement with the analytic result is good and demonstrates good energy conservation in the code .",
    "the relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath148 is interesting but not particularly useful because @xmath3 is no more readily calculated than @xmath148 ; it depends on a complicated moment of the surface density and temperature . only for constant cooling time",
    "have we been able to evaluate this moment analytically .",
    "we have assumed that external illumination of the disk is negligible .",
    "this approximation is valid when the effective temperature @xmath42 of the external irradiation is small compared to the central temperature of the disk . in the opposite limit",
    ", illumination controls the energetics of the disk and it is isothermal ( if it is illuminated directly so that shadowing effects , such as those considered by @xcite are negligible ) .",
    "it is therefore worth studying the outcome of gravitational instability in an isothermal disk .",
    "the isothermal disk model has a single parameter : the initial value of @xmath28 .",
    "we ran models with varying values of @xmath28 and with @xmath177 .",
    "we find that models with @xmath7 fragment .",
    "it is likely that the mass of the fragments , etc .",
    ", depends on how an isothermal disk becomes unstable .",
    "rapid fluctuation of the external radiation field is likely to produce a different outcome than dimming on a timescale long compared to the dynamical time .",
    "using numerical experiments , we have identified those disks that are likely to fragment absent external heating .",
    "disks with effective cooling times @xmath178 are susceptible to fragmentation .",
    "this is what one might expect based on the simple argument of @xcite : if the disk cools more quickly than the self - gravitating condensations can collide with one another , then those collisions ( which occur on a timescale @xmath179 ) can not reheat the disk and fragmentation is inevitable .",
    "but our results are at the same time surprising .",
    "the effective cooling time depends on the nonlinear outcome of gravitational instability .",
    "it depends on the cooling function , which in turn depends sensitively on @xmath10 and @xmath59 .",
    "since @xmath10 and @xmath59 vary strongly over the disk once gravitational instability has set in , it is difficult to estimate @xmath3 directly .",
    "one might be tempted to estimate @xmath180 , but our experiments show that this estimate can be off by as much as four orders of magnitude . the effect is particularly pronounced near sharp features in the opacity .",
    "for example , consider a model initially located just below the opacity gap with @xmath181 .",
    "gravitational instability creates dense regions with higher temperatures , where dust is destroyed .",
    "the result is rather like having to shed one s blanket on a cold winter morning : the disk loses its thermal energy suddenly .",
    "pressure support is lost and gravitational collapse ensues .",
    "the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath182 implies that a much larger region of the disk is susceptible to fragmentation than naive estimates based on the approximation @xmath183 might suggest .",
    "for example , consider an equilibrium disk model with @xmath184 at small @xmath185 .",
    "as @xmath185 increases , @xmath28 declines . eventually @xmath186 and gravitational instability sets in .",
    "there is then a range of radii where @xmath187 , @xmath172 and recurrent gravitational instability can transport angular momentum and prevent collapse . generally speaking",
    ", however , the cooling time decreases with increasing radius .",
    "eventually @xmath2 and fragmentation can not be avoided . by lowering our estimate of @xmath3 , we narrow the range of radii over which recurrent gravitational instability can occur .",
    "the general sense of our result is that it is extremely difficult to prevent a marginally - stable , @xmath187 , optically - thick disk from fragmenting and forming planets ( in circumstellar disks ) or stars ( in circumstellar and circumnuclear disks ) .",
    "this is particularly true for disks with @xmath188 , whose opacity is dominated by dust grains , i.e. disks whose temperature lies within a factor of several of the opacity gap .",
    "our numerical model uses a number of approximations .",
    "first , our treatment is razor - thin , i.e. all the matter is in a thin slice at @xmath189 .",
    "the effect of finite thickness on linear stability has been understood since @xcite : it is stabilizing because gravitational attraction of neighboring columns of disk is diluted by finite thickness .",
    "the size of the effect may be judged by the fact that @xmath190 is required for marginal stability of a finite - thickness , isothermal disk .",
    "the behavior of a finite - thickness disk in the nonlinear regime is more difficult to predict .",
    "shocks will evidently deposit some of their energy away from the midplane , where it can be radiated away more quickly ( because the energy is deposited at smaller optical depth - see @xcite ) .",
    "radiative diffusion parallel to the disk plane ( not included here ) may enhance cooling of dense , hot regions . both these effects are destabilizing . ultimately , however , a numerical study is required .",
    "this is numerically expensive : one must resolve the disk vertically , on the scale height @xmath191 , and horizontally , at the critical wavelength @xmath192 .",
    "second , we have ignored magnetic fields . while there may be astrophysical situations where cool disks have such low ionization that they are unmagnetized , most disks are likely to contain dynamically important magnetic fields that give rise to a dimensionless shear stress @xmath193 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these fields are likely to remove spin angular momentum from partially collapsed objects , destabilizing them .",
    "numerical experiments including both gravitational fields and magnetohydrodynamics are necessarily three dimensional ( the instability of @xcite requires @xmath194 ) , and are thus numerically expensive .",
    "third , we have fixed @xmath60 and @xmath86 for the duration of each simulation .",
    "this eliminates the soft spots in the equation of state associated with ionization of atomic hydrogen and dissociation of molecular hydrogen . in these locations the three dimensional @xmath60 dips below @xmath195 , which is destabilizing .",
    "fourth , we have treated the physics of grain destruction and formation very simply . in using the @xcite opacities we implicitly assume that grains reform in cooling gas on much less than a dynamical time .",
    "it is likely that grain re - formation will take some time ( e.g. @xcite ) and this will further reduce the disk opacity and enhance fragmentation .",
    "fifth , we have neglected the effects of illumination . in the limit of strong external illumination ,",
    "i.e. when the effective temperature of the irradiation @xmath42 is large compared to the disk central temperature @xmath43 , the disk is isothermal ( here @xmath43 is the temperature of a dense condensation ) .",
    "we have carried out isothermal experiments and shown that , for initial velocity perturbations with @xmath114 , disks with @xmath7 fragment .",
    "weaker illumination produces a more complicated situation that we have not explored here .",
    "illumination - dominated disks that become unstable presumably do so because the external illumination declines , and the rate at which the external illumination changes may govern the nonlinear outcome .      as an example application of this result , consider the model for the nucleus of ngc 1068 recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "their model is an extended marginally - stable self - gravitating disk of the type investigated here and originally proposed by @xcite for galactic disks and @xcite for accretion disks , although their disk is sufficiently massive that it modifies the rotation curve as well .",
    "based on their figure 3 , at a typical radius of @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 . according to our figure 7",
    "this disk is about 2 orders of magnitude too dense to avoid fragmentation .",
    "while it may be possible to avoid this conclusion by invoking strong external heating , the energy requirements are severe , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "the disk proposed by @xcite would therefore fragment into stars on a short timescale .",
