    "this interaction usually results in some effects of forcing and dissipation . in the simplest situation , the one that we shall consider here ,",

    "in addition to the long - range interaction , the particles experience a friction force and a stochastic force ( noise ) .",
    "if we assume a detailed balance condition , the diffusion coefficient @xmath3 and the friction coefficient @xmath4 satisfy the einstein relation @xmath5 where @xmath2 is the temperature of the bath .",

    "we recover the results of the vlasov equation and for @xmath6 ( strong friction limit ) we recover the results of the smoluchowski equation . these results are illustrated for self - gravitating systems , plasmas , and for the attractive and repulsive bmf models .",
