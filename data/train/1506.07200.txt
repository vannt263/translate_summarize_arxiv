    "this @xmath105 value is 1600 times larger than the ratio of uv fluxes at the surface for a prebiotic world orbiting an f0v host star , which highlights the importance of including the action spectrum when considering biological effects . for the anoxic atmosphere at 3.9 ga",

    "for the f stars , this is due to increased shielding from higher abundances of ozone . for the cooler k and m stars , this is due to a lower abundance of stellar uv photons incident on the atmosphere .    ]    in fig .",

    "[ epochsuv ] shows the smoothed lines for the surface uv flux for an earth - sized planet at the four geological epochs with the action spectrum curve overlaid for all grid stars modeled .",
    "in this study , we investigated the exoplanet surface uv fluxes for earth - like planets orbiting a grid of f , g , k , and m stars at four possible biogeological epochs in the evolution of life .",
    "we use the input flux from 12 different stellar types , nine model stars in the fgkm range with @xmath0 = 4250k to @xmath0 = 7000k , and three m stars ( gj 581 , gj 832 , and gj 1214 ) with observed uv fluxes for our calculations .",
    "the atmospheres selected correspond to a pre - biotic earth model at 3.9 ga , a model atmosphere for the early rise of oxygen at 2.0 ga and 0.8 ga , and modern earth biology . in terms of total uv flux at the surface ,",
    "an f star receives 1 - 2 times more flux than the sun , where as an m star receives 20 - 900 times less flux than the sun depending on the sub - spectral class .    we also consider the amount of uva , uvb and uvc fluxes , with the latter two showing the greatest changes among stellar types and geological epochs . for a pre - biotic atmosphere , a significant portion of incident uvc flux reaches the surface . whereas in the modern atmosphere for planets orbiting any grid star , all uvc photons are effectively shielded by ozone .",
    "for all epochs , the smallest percentage of total uv flux compared to incident flux reaching the ground is for an m8v star and the highest fraction is for a k7v star due to the balance of available near- and far - uv photons and the amounts of ozone produced .",
    "however in terms of absolute flux , the smallest amount reaches the surface is for an m8v host star and the largest amount for an f0v star .    to analyze the potential biological consequences of the uv surface environment for the origin and evolution of life , we convolve the uv surface fluxes with the dna action spectrum as a proxy for biological damage .",
    "while it is uncertain whether dna will arise as the primary information carrier on another planet , current biosignature searches are focused on finding carbon - based chemistry .",
    "since the action spectra for other carbon based biomolecules follow similar trends in their actions spectra , we use dna as a proxy for biochemical effectiveness of uv radiation damage .",

    "d. radiodurans _ can survive 400 j m@xmath91 of 254 nm radiation without significant loss of viability with appreciable loss of viability occurring around 500 - 600 j m@xmath91 @xcite .",
    "we find that a pre - biotic earth ( 3.9 gyr ago ) orbiting an f0v star receives 6 times the biologically effective radiation as around the early sun and 3500 times the modern earth - sun levels .",
    "a pre - biotic earth orbiting an m8v star around receives 300 times less biologically effective radiation and 2 times modern earth - sun levels .    for the second geological epoch with 1% pal o@xmath3 , a planet orbiting an f0v and m8v star receives 15 and 230 times less biologically effective radiation as the earth - sun model at that geological epoch , respectively . for the third geological epoch with 10% pal o@xmath3 , a planet orbiting an f0v and",
    "m8v star receives 2 and 12 times less biologically effective radiation as the earth - sun model at that geological epoch , respectively . for the fourth geological epoch",
    ", corresponding to modern earth concentrations of o@xmath3 , a planet orbiting an f0v and m8v star receives 3 and 250 times less biologically effective radiation as the modern earth - sun , respectively .",
    "note that for all epochs after oxygen begins to rise in the atmosphere , both the hottest stars and coolest stars have less biologically effective radiation . for the hottest stars , this is due to increased ozone shielding from higher uv environments , and for the coolest stars this is due to less absolute uv flux .",
    "a layer of water or soil might be needed to shield life for hot stars . even for a planet orbiting the least uv active star in our grid ,",
    "the biologically effective irradiance on the surface of a pre - biotic world is several times the value for modern earth . with higher ozone concentration in the atmosphere , that value decreases for planets orbiting all star types .",
    "we model clear sky atmospheres for all planets at all epochs which on average will represent an upper limit to the uv radiation environment at the surface since clouds most frequently block up to 80% of incoming uv radiation @xcite .",
    "however clouds also can focus more uv radiation to the ground depending on cloud cover and type , increasing the amount of uv radiation reaching the surface .",
    "earth measurements of uva and uvb radiation on cloudy versus cloud - free days show clouds can enhance uv radiation by a factor of 1.08 and 1.4 for uva and uvb radiation , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that higher co@xmath3 and ch@xmath4 concentrations in the atmosphere as well as hazes could further protect the surface from uv radiation @xcite .",
    "in addition , uv photons may also positively contribute to pre - biotic reactions leading to the origin of life @xcite .",
    "our models provide boundary conditions for the uv environment on the surface of earth - like planets orbiting a grid of fgkm stars from pre - biotic to modern earth atmosphere .",
    "our results inform photo biological assessments , pre - biotic chemistry , and early life evolution experiments .",
