    "due to the explosive increase of mobile data traffic , cellular operators have been deploying denser base stations ( bss ) with increasing frequency reuse factor for providing higher capacity to subscribers .",
    "however , this gives rise to the more severe inter - cell interference ( ici ) , which becomes one key issue to be tackled in future wireless networks . to meet this challenge , coordinated multi - point ( comp )",
    "transmission has emerged as one promising technique ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , where multiple bss cooperatively serve a group of mobile users by implementing baseband signal coordination to transform the harmful ici into useful information signals for coherent transmission / reception in the downlink and uplink transmissions , respectively .",
    "another potential challenge faced by cellular operators is their drastically increasing operational costs due to the on - grid energy consumption by the growing number of bss . among assorted solutions that are proposed to overcome this issue , equipping bss with energy harvesters that can harvest energy from the environmental sources , e.g. ,",
    "solar and wind , is a promising solution , since the cost of renewable energy generation is generally lower than that of the conventional energy from the grid @xcite .",
    "furthermore , with the advancement of smart girds technology , two - way energy and information flows become feasible between distributed loads and the grid for enabling more energy - efficient power networks @xcite . as a specific type of energy loads , bss in cellular networks",
    "can thereby be enabled to implement the two - way energy trading with the grid @xcite to more efficiently utilize their locally generated renewable energy for saving the energy cost . with two - way energy trading ,",
    "bss of renewable energy surplus can sell its excessive energy to the grid to make profit , while bss of renewable energy deficit can buy additional energy from the grid to maintain its reliable operation and communication .    in this paper",
    ", we pursue a unified study of comp based communication cooperation and two - way energy trading enabled energy cooperation in a cellular system powered by smart girds , where each bs is equipped with one or more energy harvesting devices ( wind - turbines and/or solar panels ) to generate renewable energy locally , and implements the two - way energy trading with the grid . in practice ,",
    "the renewable generation rates and communication energy demands are both uneven over distributed bss , which is due to the fact that different bss may use different types of energy harvesting devices ( with distinct energy generation capacities ) , and face diverse wireless service requests from randomly arrived cellular users . furthermore , due to different energy supply and demand conditions in the whole grid , the prices for each bs to buy and sell one unit of energy from / to the grid are in general different @xcite . by considering all these practical issues ,",
    "new research challenges are imposed on the cost - efficient management of energy consumption in comp based communication and energy trading with the grid , for which the conventional comp designs ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) that ignore the new feature of two - way energy trading in smart grids are no more effective .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 1     specifically , to illustrate this new challenge , we consider a toy example as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : toy_example ] , where two single - antenna bss cooperatively transmit to a single - antenna mobile terminal ( mt ) , and the mt has a given quality of service ( qos ) requirement to be met .",
    "suppose that the channel coefficients from bs 1 and bs 2 to the mt are given by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and the background gaussian noise at the mt has a normalized power of @xmath2 . by assuming that received signals are coherently combined , the resulting signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) at the mt",
    "is then expressed as @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 denoting the transmit power at bs 1 and bs 2 , respectively .",
    "we assume the qos requirement at the mt as a minimum snr equal to @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "let the energy harvesting rates at the two bss be denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the energy prices for both the two bss to buy and sell one unit of energy from and to the grid by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "note that all units are normalized for simplicity . under the above setup",
    ", we compare the conventional comp design to minimize the total transmit power of the two bss ( but ignoring the different renewable energy rates at the two bss as well as the two - way energy trading prices ) versus our proposed new comp design with joint energy trading consideration ( details will be given later ) , including their respective power , total energy consumption , and total energy cost in table [ table1 ] .",
    "more details on their performance comparison are given as follows .",
    "* * conventional comp design @xcite : * the two bss first determine their transmit power values with comp downlink transmission to minimize the sum - power to achieve @xmath11 at the mt . based on the optimal maximal ratio combining ( mrc ) principle , the transmit powers at bs 1 and bs 2 are obtained as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the total energy consumption of the two bss is thus @xmath14 .",
    "next , given the available renewable energy at the two bss , bs 1 needs to purchase @xmath15 unit of energy from the grid at the price @xmath16 per unit , while bs 2 should sell @xmath17 unit of energy to the grid at the price @xmath18 per unit , resulting in a total energy cost of @xmath19 . *",
    "* proposed comp design with joint energy trading consideration : * the two bss jointly optimize the comp based communication cooperation and the energy trading with the grid for minimizing the total energy cost ( see section [ sec : optimal ] for the detailed algorithm ) .",
    "accordingly , the transmit powers at bs 1 and bs 2 are given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "as a result , the total energy consumed is @xmath22 , and the total energy cost is @xmath23 .",
    "it is observed from the above comparison that although the conventional comp design achieves the lowest sum - power consumption ( i.e. , @xmath24 as compared to @xmath25 ) , it incurs much larger total energy cost than the proposed design ( i.e. , @xmath26 versus @xmath27 ) .",
    "this is because the conventional design optimizes transmit powers without considering the differences in renewable generation rates at the two bss as well as the energy buying / selling prices with the grid , while the proposed design exploits such differences , so that the cheaper renewable energy is more efficiently utilized and the more expensive energy from the grid is minimized .",
    "this toy example , albeit being simplistic , suggests that to reduce the energy cost of comp systems powered by smart grids , it is crucial to jointly optimize the bss energy management in comp transmission and energy trading with the grid , by taking into account the different renewable generation rates over the bss and the distinct energy buying / selling prices . to our best knowledge , such a joint optimization approach has not been studied in the literature , which motivates this work .    for the purpose of exposition",
    ", we consider in this paper the downlink transmission in one comp cluster , where a group of multiple - antenna bss each with local renewable energy generation cooperatively transmit to a set of single - antenna mts by applying linear transmit precoding .",
    "we jointly optimize the bss purchased / sold energy units from / to the grid and their cooperative transmit precoding , so as to minimize the total energy cost of the bss subject to the given qos constraints for the mts .",
    "first , we obtain the optimal solution to this problem by developing an algorithm based on techniques from convex optimization @xcite and the uplink - downlink duality @xcite .",
    "next , we propose a sub - optimal solution of lower complexity than the optimal solution , where zero - forcing ( zf ) based cooperative transmit precoding @xcite is considered . finally , we show by extensive simulations the promising performance gain achieved by our proposed optimal and sub - optimal schemes in terms of energy cost reduction , as compared to conventional schemes with separate communication cooperation and energy trading designs .",
    "it is worth noting that recently there have been several studies on improving the energy efficiency of cellular networks by taking advantage of various smart grid features @xcite .",
    "for instance , the utilities of both the cellular network and the power network are jointly optimized in @xcite .",
    "an alternative form of energy cooperation , where distributed bss exchange their locally harvested energy via dedicated power lines @xcite or utilizing the smart grid infrastructure @xcite , is also studied .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that our proposed joint energy trading and communication cooperation approach is more general than that in the prior works on exploiting the two - way energy trading in smart grids only @xcite .",
    "the prior studies in @xcite focus on the energy trading management for distributed loads with the grid , by assuming their energy demands to be given .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we consider a specific type of energy loads ( i.e. , bss in cellular networks for communication ) and jointly optimize their energy demands for communication and the two - way energy trading with the grid for reducing the overall energy cost .",
    "our proposed approach thus provides new useful insights on the joint demand- and supply - side energy management in smart grids by considering controllable energy loads through communications design and scheduling .",

    "we denote the set of mts and that of bss as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "we assume that each bs is locally equipped with one or more energy harvesting devices ( wind turbines and/or solar panels ) , and is also connected to the smart grid for implementing the two - way energy trading .",
    "we also assume that there is a central unit deployed for each comp cluster which coordinates the cooperative energy trading as well as the cooperative communication within the cluster . to this end",
    ", the central unit needs to collect both the communication data ( i.e. , the transmit messages and channel state information ( csi ) ) from each of the bss through the cellular backhaul links , and the energy information ( i.e. , the energy harvesting rates and energy buying / selling prices ) via the smart meters installed at bss and the grid - deployed communication / control links connecting them .",
    "the central unit can be one of the @xmath52 bss that serves as the cluster head , or a dedicatedly deployed entity in the network .",
    "= 1     we assume block - based transmissions and quasi - static models for both the renewable energy processes and wireless channels , where the energy harvesting rates and the channel coefficients remain constant during each communication block and may change from one block to another .",
    "this model is practical , since the coherence time of a wireless channel ( say , several milliseconds ) is usually much smaller than that of an energy harvesting process ( e.g. , a few tens of seconds for solar and wind power ) . for convenience , each block duration is normalized to unity unless otherwise specified ; thus , the terms `` energy '' and `` power '' will be used interchangeably in the sequel . for",
    "the purpose of investigation , in this paper we do not consider energy storage devices used at each of the bss due to their high deployment and maintenance costs , and will leave the case with finite energy storage at bss for our future work . as a result",
    ", each bs will either consume all of its harvested energy for communication or sell any excessive energy to the grid during each block .",
    "this simplifies our analysis to one particular block for investigation , and also helps provide insights on the achievable gain by cooperative energy trading and communication cooperation .",
    "next , we explain the energy management model at the bss , then present the downlink comp transmission model , and finally formulate the optimization problem for joint energy trading and communication cooperation .      as assumed above , each bs",
    "is equipped with energy harvesting devices and is also connected to the grid for two - way energy trading .",
    "we denote the harvested energy at each bs @xmath53 as @xmath54 , which is a given constant for one block of our interest .",

    "( @xmath58 ) by each bs @xmath55 from ( to ) the grid needs to be upper - bounded due to the limited capacity of the power lines connecting them .",
    "this is ensured here since @xmath59 and @xmath58 are no larger than the maximum power consumption at bs @xmath55 ( to be specified later ) and the maximum harvested energy of @xmath60 , respectively , both of which are set to be smaller than the capacity of the power lines .",
    "also note that cellular bss are just one among many types of power loads in the smart grid , and thus the total energy sold by all bss to the grid ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) can be temporally larger or smaller than that purchased from the grid ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) .",
    "for example , in the case of more energy sold to the gird , the smart grid can schedule the excessive energy to supply other conventional loads ( without renewable energy supply ) in the grid .",
    "] when each bs @xmath55 buys ( sells ) one unit energy from ( to ) the grid , we denote the price that it needs to pay to ( or will be paid by ) the grid as @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "then we have the net energy cost at bs @xmath55 as @xmath65 note that @xmath66 can be positive ( e.g. , @xmath67 ) , negative ( e.g. , @xmath68 ) , or zero . in practice , to prevent any bs from buying the energy from the gird and then selling back to it to make non - justifiable profit which leads to energy inefficiency , the grid operator should set @xmath69 ; as a result , we can induce that at most one of @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be strictly positive , i.e. , @xmath72 ( otherwise , the cost in ( [ total : cost ] ) can be further reduced by setting @xmath73 and @xmath74 if @xmath75 , or @xmath76 and @xmath77 if @xmath78 ) . moreover , the energy selling price is usually subject to a minimum value , given by @xmath79 , to encourage the renewable generation investment at the bss ; while the energy buying price can not exceed the maximum electricity price in the grid , given by @xmath80 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath81    in cellular systems , the power consumption at each bs typically includes both the transmission power due to radio frequency ( rf ) power amplifiers ( pas ) , and the non - transmission power due to other components such as cooling systems , baseband units ( bbu ) for data processing , and circuits of rf chains ( see fig . [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we denote the radiated transmit power of each bs @xmath55 by @xmath82 , and generally model the non - transmission power as a constant denoted by @xmath83 . by combining them ,",
    "we obtain the total power consumption at bs @xmath55 , denoted by @xmath84 , which should be no larger than the total energy available at bs @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the pa efficiency . since @xmath87 is a constant ,",
    "we normalize it as @xmath88 unless stated otherwise .",
    "next , we present the downlink comp transmission among the @xmath52 bss in one cluster .",
    "we denote the channel vector from bs @xmath55 to mt @xmath35 as @xmath89 , and the channel vector from all @xmath52 bss in the cluster to mt @xmath35 as @xmath90^t\\in \\mathbb{c}^{mn\\times 1 } , k\\in\\mathcal{k}$ ] .",

    "let the information signal for mt @xmath91 be denoted by @xmath92 and its associated beamforming vector across the @xmath52 bss by @xmath93 .",
    "then the transmitted signal for mt @xmath35 can be expressed as @xmath94 where @xmath92 is assumed to be a complex random variable with zero mean and unite variance .",
    "thus , the received signal at mt @xmath35 is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the desired signal for mt @xmath35 , @xmath97 is the inter - user interference within the same cluster , and @xmath98 denotes the background additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at mt @xmath35 , which may also include the downlink interference from other bss outside this cluster .",

    "<S> this paper studies the energy management in the coordinated multi - point ( comp ) systems powered by smart grids , where each base station ( bs ) with local renewable energy generation is allowed to implement the two - way energy trading with the grid . due to the uneven renewable energy supply and communication energy demand over distributed bss as well as the difference in the prices for their buying / selling energy from / to the gird , </S>",
    "<S> it is beneficial for the cooperative bss to jointly manage their energy trading with the grid and energy consumption in comp based communication for reducing the total energy cost . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider the downlink transmission in one comp cluster by jointly optimizing the bss purchased / sold energy units from / to the grid and their cooperative transmit precoding , so as to minimize the total energy cost subject to the given quality of service ( qos ) constraints for the users . </S>",
    "<S> first , we obtain the optimal solution to this problem by developing an algorithm based on techniques from convex optimization and the uplink - downlink duality . </S>",
    "<S> next , we propose a sub - optimal solution of lower complexity than the optimal solution , where zero - forcing ( zf ) based precoding is implemented at the bss . finally , through extensive simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we show the performance gain achieved by our proposed joint energy trading and communication cooperation schemes in terms of energy cost reduction , as compared to conventional schemes that separately design communication cooperation and energy trading .    </S>",
