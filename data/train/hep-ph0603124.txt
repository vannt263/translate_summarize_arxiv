    "the standard model ( sm ) top quark couplings are uniquely fixed by the principle of gauge invariance , the structure of the quark generations , and a requirement of including the lowest dimension interaction lagrangian  @xcite . within the sm",
    "the top quark is considered as a point - like particle .",
    "it should be stressed , that within the sm all top - quark production properties and decays are evaluated with high accuracy without any phenomenological parameters .",
    "the total cross section production as well as the differential distributions are calculated with @xmath0 accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the top quark decays through one decay channel , @xmath1 ( other decay channels have very small branching ratios , less then @xmath2 . due to a very small life - time ( @xmath3  sec , @xmath4 ) the top - quark decays long before it can hadronize .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely to expect the formation of top - hadrons , @xmath5- or @xmath6-mesons and @xmath7-baryons .",
    "the search for anomalous ( i.e. non - sm ) interactions is one of the main motivations for studying top - quark physics .",
    "in addition , very often the events with the top quarks are backgrounds to new physics that we hope to discover .",
    "the physics of the top quark at the lhc has been studied in great detail  @xcite , including in many cases a realistic simulation of the detectors ( see talks at this workshop ) .",
    "the goal of this presentation is to give a short review of monte carlo ( mc ) generators that provide a simulation of the processes with top - quark production and decays ( the detailed considerations could be found elsewhere  @xcite ) .",
    "a general scheme of complete event simulation implies the evaluation of the hard process ( the cross section value , the incoming and outgoing particle s momenta and colours ) , then the evolution the event through a parton showering and the hadronization of the coloured products of shower , followed by the decay of the unstable particles . as a result",
    "the event is described by the momenta of the final hadrons , leptons and photons and positions of their decay vertexes .",
    "typically such information includes also the characteristics ( momenta , colours , kf - codes , mother s and daughter s relations ) of all intermediate partons ( quarks , gluons , gauge bosons , unstable physical particles , etc ) that allows to trace - back the history of particles production inside the event .",
    "any such generator using an acceptance - rejection method ( von neumann ) returns weighted event .",
    "the most popular complete event generators , like herwig  @xcite , pythia  @xcite , isajet  @xcite , and sherpa  @xcite include all such steps of simulation .    the processes with top - quarks and their realization in mc generators are described in the following .",
    "the diagrams describing top - pair and single top production ( at leading order ",
    "lo ) are presented on figs  [ fig : dia - ttbar ] , [ fig : dia - sng ] .",
    "production ( qcd ) , scaledwidth=50.0% ]        in almost all cases one needs to know the information not only about the final top - quark , but also about its decay products .",
    "the natural and correct way to include decays is to calculate an exact amplitude with the initial partons and final state particles .",
    "however , the full amplitude typically consists also of many diagrams without intermediate top - quarks . for examples ,",
    "the full amplitude of the process @xmath8 with the both final @xmath9-bosons decaying into electrons has many other diagrams without @xmath10-quarks . in particular , there is at least one diagram with two @xmath11-bosons : @xmath12 with one @xmath11 decaying into @xmath13 and second @xmath14 . typically , all such non - resonant diagrams ( i.e. without top - quark ) will give a very small contribution to `` resonance '' region , where when the invariant masses of the final particles are very close to @xmath10-quark and @xmath9-boson masses ( e.g. @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "therefore , for this case it is useful to introduce the narrow width approximation ( nwa ) .",
    "it means that one take into account only diagrams with intermediate top quarks and consider all @xmath10-quarks as `` on - shell '' particles : @xmath17    as a result one can factorize the production and decays of the top quark .",
    "after that , typically there are three important issues : i )  how to include top decays ? ; ii )  how to reproduce breit - wigner resonance shape ? ; iii )  how to include top spin ( polarization ) ?",
    "within the sm in 99.9% of the cases the top - quark decays into the @xmath18 final state : @xmath19 .",
    "the matrix element describing this decay is well known  @xcite : @xmath20 in fact , this is the only one decay channel that is included in almost all generators . other interesting sm channels ( e.g @xmath21 ) are still not available at generator level . at the same time",
    "few other decay channels ( due to non - sm physics ) are included in generators .",
    "in particular , they are :    @xmath22 susy : @xmath23 ( almost all packages )    @xmath22 fcnc : @xmath24 ( toprex  @xcite )    @xmath22 @xmath25 with anomalous interactions ( @xmath26 and tensor couplings , onetop  @xcite )      the narrow width approximation ( nwa ) assumes that all top quarks have the same default mass ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "there are two approaches , that allow to reproduce the breit - wigner resonance shape due to the finite decay width of the top - quark .    with the `` smearing - mass '' method the matrix elements are calculated for a default @xmath28 mass  @xcite .",
    "then for each event the breit - wigner distribution @xmath29 is used to generate separate masses ( @xmath30 ) for top - quarks .",
    "the momenta and energies of all final - state particles are re - evaluated .",
    "for example , for @xmath31 pair production with new @xmath32 and @xmath33 masses one has : @xmath34 this method certainly is not unique , but normally provides a sensible behavior .",
    "it can be used for event with any number of top quarks in final state ( @xmath10 , @xmath31 , ... ) .    in another proposed method ( modified nwa  @xcite )",
    "a new @xmath35 for @xmath10-quark in the event is generated by using of breit - wigner distribution .",
    "then , the squared matrix element ( @xmath36 ) is calculated with this new @xmath35 .",
    "this method can be used only for the process with one top quark in the final state ( i.e. not for @xmath31 production ) .      since the top quark decays before hadronization ,",
    "its spin properties are not spoiled .",
    "therefore spin correlations in top production and decays is an interesting issue in top - quark physics .",
    "the simplest way to include top polarization employs the helicity amplitude technique  @xcite .",
    "an equivalent ( and sometimes more simple for practical usage ) method  @xcite is realized in the tauola  @xcite package . in this method",
    "the matrix element squared @xmath36 can be represented in the `` factorized '' form .        for the process with one final top - quark ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tdec ] ) the full amplitude squared has the form : @xmath37 where the amplitudes @xmath38 describe the production and decay of * unpolarized * top - quark , @xmath39 is the @xmath10-quark spin ( @xmath40 ) , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the so - called `` polarization '' vectors  @xcite .",
    "for example , the spin - dependent matrix element squared describing top - quark decay @xmath43 can be re - presented in the form as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the direction of @xmath46 momentum in @xmath10-quark rest frame .",
    "recently a substantial progress has been achieved in the simulation of processes with multi - jet final states  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the description of multi - jets obtained from the shower evolution is inaccurate , since hard radiation at large angle is suppressed by the angular ordering prescription . the available generators ( alpgen , comphep , madevent , etc ) provide a generation of top production with up to 6-jets  @xcite . due to the complexity of the matrix elements(me ) evaluation for these many - body configurations , calculations are normally available only for lo cross sections .",
    "multi - parton events generated using the exact leading order me generator can be consistently evolved into multi - jet final states by means of a shower mc .",
    "the main problem is how to eliminate the double counting , where jets can arise from both the higher - order calculation and from the hard emission during the shower evolution .",
    "there are several approaches to this problem , aiming at different levels of accuracy . the first one ( `` matrix - element correction '' technique  @xcite ) corrects the approximate me for the emission of the hardest gluon in a given process by using the exact lo me .",
    "the second is known as ckkw  @xcite ; its goal is to implement multi - jet me corrections at the leading , or next - to - leading logarithmic level .",
    "this method assumes a separation of the multi - jet phase - space into the domains covered by the me calculation and the domains covered by the shower evolution . then by means of sudakov re - weighting the me s weights to reproduce the probability of an exclusive n - jet final state from the inclusive parton - level n - jet rate .",
    "this allows to add parton - level event samples of different jet multiplicity .",
    "an additional prescription is proposed in  @xcite ( `` mlm prescription '' ) . in this approach the partons from the me calculation",
    "are matched to the jets reconstructed after the perturbative shower .",
    "parton - level events are defined by a minimum  threshold  for the partons , and a minimum separation among them , @xmath47 . however , no sudakov re - weighting is applied .",
    "rather , events are showered , without any hard - emission veto during the shower . after evolution , a jet cone algorithm with cone size @xmath48 and minimum transverse energy  is applied to the final state . starting from the hardest parton , the jet which is closest to it in @xmath49 is selected . if the distance between the parton and the jet centroid is smaller than @xmath48 , the parton and the jet match .",
    "the matched jet is removed from the list of jets , and matching for subsequent partons is performed . the event is fully matched if each parton has a matched jet .",
    "events which do not match are rejected . for events which satisfy matching",
    ", it is furthermore required that no extra jet , in addition to those matching the partons , be present .",
    "events with extra jets are rejected , a suppression replacing the sudakov re - weighting used in the ckkw approach .",
    "events obtained by applying this procedure to the parton level with increasing multiplicity can then be combined to obtain fully inclusive samples spanning a large multiplicity range .",
    "events with extra jets are not rejected in the case of the sample with highest partonic multiplicity .",
    "[ fig : match ] presents an illustration of above - described examples  @xcite .",
    ", the event is matched and kept .",
    "( b ) @xmath50 , but @xmath51 , the event should be rejected .",
    "( c ) @xmath52 , but @xmath53 , the event is matched and kept for inclusive sample , but should be rejected for exclusive samples .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]      a very simple procedure is proposed for the process of @xmath10-channel single - top production  @xcite , where one has two complementary subprocess ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sng22 ] ) : @xmath55        this matching procedure is based on the transverse momentum ( @xmath56 ) of additional @xmath57-quark  @xcite .",
    "the matching procedure starts from simulation of the events with @xmath10-quark production due to @xmath58 process .",
    "such an event has an additional @xmath57-quark generated by mc showering generator ( i.e. pythia or herwig ) .",
    "any event from this sample is accepted if the transverse momentum of the additional @xmath57-quark is smaller than some value @xmath59 .",
    "the second sample consists of events from @xmath60 process .",
    "the event from this sample is accepted if the additional @xmath57-quark from a hard process has @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the resulting ( total ) sample of @xmath10-quark production events is the sum of two contributions : @xmath62 the corresponding @xmath56-distributions are shown in fig .",

    "this method of generation of @xmath10-channel single - top production is realized in singletop  @xcite and toprex  @xcite codes .",
    "recently a substantial progress has been achieved in the calculations of the single - top production at nlo  @xcite .",
    "the radiation effects are included in the initial and final states , as well as into decays . these generators ( like ztop  @xcite , onetop  @xcite and the code based on mcfm generator  @xcite )",
    "provide a generation of total cross section and differential distributions .",
    "one really needs to include nlo corrections in me generators .",
    "indeed , only shower mc s provide a representation of the final state complete enough to allow realistic detector simulations .",
    "on the other hand , the inclusion of nlo effects in fixed - order me mc s leads to distributions which are not positive definite .",
    "the naive introduction of nlo matrix element could lead to double counting , since as shower mc generators already incorporate part of the nlo effects ( a real emissions , as well as virtual effects included in the sudakov form factors ) .",
    "this problem was successfully solved ( see the article  @xcite , where it was shown how this merging can be done very effectively ) .",
    "this method is implemented in mc@nlo generator  @xcite describing heavy - quark pair , higgs , dy and gauge boson pair production .",
    "the inclusion of nlo corrections in the shower mc guarantees that total cross - sections generated by the mc reproduce those of the nlo me calculation , thereby properly including the @xmath63 factors and reducing the systematic uncertainties induced by renormalization and factorization scale variations . at the same time , however , the presence of the higher - order corrections generated by the shower will improve the description of the nlo distributions , leading to departures from the parton - level nlo result .",
