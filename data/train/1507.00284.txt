    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) represent the last stages in the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars , before they turn into white dwarfs .",
    "a large fraction of pne presents complex morphologies , including axisymmetric shells , multipolar lobes , and collimated structures , in sharp contrast with the spherical envelopes typically seen around asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( e.g. , olofsson et al .",
    "somehow , the spherical agb envelope is transformed into the complex pn shell . _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) observations have led to the suggestion that the shaping of the most structured young pne ( or proto - planetary nebulae , proto - pne ) could be attributed to the action of high - speed collimated outflows or jets that operate during the late - agb and/or early post - agb phase , as they interact with the intrinsically spherical agb circumstellar envelope ( sahai & trauger @xcite ) .",
    "these observations indicate that collimated outflows probably also play a crucial role in the shaping and dynamical evolution of pne ( e.g. , dennis et al .",
    "@xcite ; huarte - espinosa et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "collimated outflows or jet - like structures have been identified in a significant number of pne .",
    "the origin of collimated outflows is still uncertain , although they are most likely related to the evolution of binary systems , the action of magnetic fields , or both ( e.g. , soker @xcite ; de  marco @xcite ) .",
    "particularly , binary interactions that involve accretion ( e.g. , soker @xcite ; soker & livio @xcite ; reyes - ruiz & lpez @xcite ; nordhaus & blackman @xcite ; blackman & lucchini @xcite ) have been considered to be a plausible engine to produce the ubiquitous collimated outflows in pne and proto - pne ( e.g. , balick & frank @xcite ) .",
    "recently , tocknell , de  marco & wardle @xcite constrained the physical properties of the common envelope ( ce ) interaction using the observed masses and kinematics of jets in four post - ce pne .",
    "detailed studies of the spectra of jet - like structures in pne are scarce , but they generally report strong low - excitation emission lines ( particularly from [ n  ii ] ) combined with high - excitation emission lines ( e.g. , [ o  iii ] ; guerrero et al .",
    "@xcite ; gonalves et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this notable difference with the spectra of the main nebular shells",
    "can be attributed to the combined contributions of ionizing photons from the central star and excitation by shocks .",
    "therefore , these structures are candidates of irradiated shocks , i.e. , bow - shocks that are illuminated by ionizing ( stellar ) fluxes from the post - shock direction ( e.g. , hartigan , raymond & hartmann @xcite ) .",
    "hu1 - 2 ( png086.5@xmath508.8 ) , first identified by humason @xcite and classified as elliptical by manchado et al .",
    "@xcite , is a pn with fast , highly collimated outflows .",
    "recently , miranda et al .",
    "@xcite identified two bipolar compact knots along the main axis of hu1 - 2 with bow - shock - like morphologies .",
    "an analysis of the radial velocities and proper motions of these knots showed that they move at velocities @xmath0340 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this velocity is much higher than the expansion velocities of the collimated outflows observed in most pne ( guerrero et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for instance , the bright `` saturn nebula '' , ngc7009 , has an elliptical main nebula with a pair of [ n  ii]-bright outer knots along its major axis ( e.g. , gonalves et al .  @xcite ) . despite the morphological similarities with hu1 - 2 , the expansion velocity of @xmath660  kms@xmath1 reported for the bipolar knots of ngc7009 ( reay & atherton @xcite ) is much lower than that observed in hu1 - 2 , although we recall that the expansion velocity of the knots in ngc7009 is quite uncertain ( gonalves et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the high - velocity and bow - shock - like morphology led miranda et al .",
    "@xcite to conclude that these knots probably represent bow - shocks associated to high - velocity bullets .",
    "furthermore , a preliminary analysis of narrow - band images of the knots suggests that [ n  ii ] peaks farther away from the central star than [ o  iii ] ( miranda et al .",
    "the enhanced [ n   ii ] emission in the knots seems to imply shock - excitation , whereas the strong [ o  iii ] emission rather points to irradiation from the central star .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of the emission spectrum of the knots is crucial to determine the excitation mechanism , as done by , e.g. , riera et al .",
    "@xcite for hen3 - 1475 and guerrero et al .",
    "@xcite for ic4634 .",
    "the physical structure of its main nebular shell is also largely unknown .",
    "narrow - band [ n  ii ] image ( miranda et al .",
    "@xcite ) reveals a complex morphology for its innermost regions , which adds to the peculiar velocity field revealed by kinematical studies ( sabbadin , bianchini & hamzaoglu @xcite ; sabbadin , cappellaro & turatto @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the kinematical structure of the faint bipolar lobes is completely unknown .",
    "the relatively large he / h and n / o abundance ratios of the bright inner regions of hu1 - 2 qualify it to be type  i pn ( peimbert & torres - peimbert @xcite ) , but detailed abundance analyses of the same nebular regions ( pottasch et al .",
    "@xcite ; hyung , pottasch & feibelman @xcite ) found that abundances of the @xmath4 elements ( oxygen , neon , sulfur and argon ) are much lower than those in most other galactic pne .",
    "this peculiar abundance pattern may shed light on the origin and evolution of hu1 - 2 , but a spatially - resolved study of the physical conditions , chemical abundances , and excitation mechanisms is lacking .    in this paper",
    "we present high spatial resolution narrow - band optical and near - infrared images and high- and intermediate - dispersion long - slit optical spectra of hu1 - 2 .",
    "these data have allowed us to carry out a complete analysis of its spatio - kinematical properties and physical conditions , abundances , and excitation mechanisms .",
    "particular emphasis is made in the investigation of the properties of the collimated outflows in hu1 - 2 .",
    "narrow - band optical images in the [ o  iii ] , h@xmath4 , and [ n  ii ] emission lines were acquired on 2008 september 2 using the andaluca faint object spectrograph and camera ( alfosc ) on the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) of the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( orm ) on the island of la palma ( spain ) .",
    "the characteristics of the narrow - band filters used in these observations ( central wavelength @xmath7 and bandwidth @xmath8 ) are summarized in table  [ imagery ] .",
    "an eev 2k@xmath92k ccd was used as detector , yielding a plate scale of 0184 pixel@xmath1 and a field of view ( fov ) of 63@xmath963 .",
    "two images in each filter were obtained with a small dithering between them to eliminate cosmic rays and reduce cosmetic defects of the ccd .",
    "the images were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded by twilight flats , and combined using standard iraf v2.14.1 routines .",
    "the spatial resolution of the final images , as derived from the fwhm of stars in fov is 07 .",
    "the three images were then background - subtracted and flux - calibrated using the h@xmath4 , [ n  ii ] @xmath106583 and [ o  iii ] @xmath105007 line fluxes measured in the intermediate - dispersion spectrum that will be presented in section  2.2 .",
    "the individual flux - calibrated narrow - band images of hu1 - 2 are presented in figure  [ grey_img ] , whereas a color - composite picture is displayed in figure  [ color_img ] . in figure  [ nii_cont ]",
    "we present a close - up of the [ n  ii ] emission from the inner region of hu1 - 2 .",
    "narrow - band , near - infrared ( ir ) images were obtained on 2004 july 11 with the 3.5 m telescope nazionale galileo ( tng ) also at the orm .",
    "the near - infrared camera and spectrograph ( nics ) was used with a 1024@xmath91024 rockwell hgcdte array .",
    "the spatial scale is 013 pixel@xmath1 and the fov is 22@xmath922 .",

    "the parameters associated to the jet launching in hu1 - 2 and those studied by tocknell , de  marco & wardle @xcite are presented in table  [ luminosity ] .",
    "a comparison among them indicates that the bipolar knots of hu1 - 2 are lighter , less massive than those of the necklace nebula and ngc6778 , whereas their ejection time - scale is much shorter .",
    "the two effects combined result in very similar mechanical luminosities for all sources in table  [ luminosity ] .",
    "we note the large uncertainty in the estimate of the ejection time - scale of the knots of hu1 - 2 .",
    "dynamical effects are certainly playing a crucial role in the evolution of the outflow , compressing the head of the flow ( reducing the apparent ejection time - scale ) or lagging material upstream ( increasing the apparent ejection time - scale ) .",
    "thus this ejection time - scale could be quite uncertain and so is the derived jets mechanical luminosity ( @xmath15 ) of hu1 - 2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the jets mechanical luminosity of ngc6778 is extremely high ( table  [ luminosity ] ) , if we adopt the parameters given in tocknell , de  marco & wardle @xcite .",
    "this pn , which has a similar distance ( @xmath62.6  kpc ; tocknell , de  marco & wardle @xcite ) as hu1 - 2 , has a highly disrupted equatorial ring and a binary central star ( miszalski et al .",
    "@xcite ; guerrero & miranda @xcite ) . both ngc6778 and the necklace nebula in table  [ luminosity ] have a post - common envelope ( post - ce ) close binary in the center ( miszalski et al .  @xcite ; corradi et al .",
    "@xcite ) . like ngc6778",
    ", hu1 - 2 displays an overall bipolar structure and a likely disrupted equatorial ring .",
    "this resemblance suggests that hu1 - 2 might have similar jet - launching mechanisms as the other two pne .",
    "we have presented a thorough imaging and spectroscopic study of the main nebular regions and bipolar outflows of hu1 - 2 .",
    "the physical structure of the main nebula can be described as bipolar , although its velocity field can not be described by a simple hour - glass law .",
    "the inclination of the bipolar lobes is @xmath1610  and its polar expansion velocity @xmath17150  kms@xmath1 , resulting in a lower - limit expansion age @xmath181100  yr .",
    "neither the morphology nor the kinematics of the central , @xmath19-shaped innermost region of hu1 - 2 can be simply described as a waist or torus located between the two bipolar lobes .",
    "the knotty morphology of this region and its relatively high expansion velocity , @xmath1740  kms@xmath1 , are suggestive of a `` broken '' equatorial ring . the distorted velocity field of the bipolar lobes and the complex morphology of the equatorial regions make us conclude that hu1 - 2 has experienced notable violent dynamical processes during its formation .",
    "similar interpretation has been given to the disrupted equatorial regions of a few bipolar pne known to harbor binary systems ( e.g. , ngc6778 , ngc7354 ; contreras et al .",
    "@xcite ; miszalski et al .",
    "@xcite ; guerrero & miranda @xcite ) .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that the fast bipolar knots present in all these sources are dynamical agents which caused the disrupted equatorial features .",
    "it is interesting to remark here the apparent discrepancies implied by the chemical abundances of hu1 - 2 .",
    "the high he / h and n / o abundance ratios suggest a type  i nature for hu1 - 2 , which indicates that it descended from a relatively massive intermediate - mass progenitor star ( @xmath204  @xmath21 ; e.g. , karakas et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , the low abundances of the heavy elements of hu1 - 2",
    "suggest it formed long time ago , probably in an early - stage of the chemical evolution of the galaxy , and thus it corresponds to a low - mass progenitor .",
    "cases of type  i pne with very low abundances of @xmath4 elements can be interpreted as a result of formation of a massive pn progenitor from unmixed ( i.e. , metal - poor ) interstellar material ( milingo et al .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore",
    ", the chemical composition of hu1 - 2 probably does not represent that of its current environment .",
    "this might indeed be the case . at a galactocentric distance @xmath69kpc , as estimated from the distance to hu1 - 2 ( @xmath63.5kpc ; miranda et al .",
    "@xcite ) , its galactic longitude ( 865 ) and the galactocentric distance of the sun ( 8.3kpc ; gillessen et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the oxygen abundance of the interstellar medium is @xmath64@xmath910@xmath22 ( henry et al .",
    "@xcite , and figure  1 therein ) , which is much higher than that of hu1 - 2 ( see table  [ elemental ] ) .",
    "alternatively , type  i pne have long been connected to bipolar morphology ( e.g. , peimbert & torres - peimbert @xcite ) which is likely the result of binary interactions ( e.g. , soker @xcite ) or common envelope binary interaction ( e.g. , zijlstra @xcite ; de  marco @xcite ; miszalski et al .",
    "the abundance pattern of hu1 - 2 might be due to the effects of binary interactions on the evolution of the progenitor and the composition of the subsequent pn , although so far it is not clear whether there is a binary central star in hu1 - 2",
    ". detailed discussion of this point is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we also discussed the possibility of hu1 - 2 being a halo pn , given that it is quite out of the galactic plane ( @xmath23 = @xmath588 ) .",
    "although the oxygen abundances of hu1 - 2 and its distance to the galactic plane marginally support a halo nature , its low peculiar radial velocity obviously argues against a halo nature for hu1 - 2 .",
    "the collimated bipolar outflows of hu1 - 2 are particularly interesting .",
    "they show a notable bow - shock - like morphology .",
    "the emission within these structures is found to be highly stratified , with [ n  ii ] peaking at the leading edge of the bow - shock and [ o  iii ] mostly occupying the star - facing region .",
    "this profile is similar to that found in the bow - shock structures of pne such as ic4634 and ngc7009 .",
    "previous spatio - kinematical studies have suggested an expansion velocity @xmath0340  kms@xmath1 for the outer knots of hu1 - 2 .",
    "this high expansion velocity of the bipolar knots , together with the bow - shock - like morphology associated with them , indicate that the high - velocity , collimated bipolar outflows are moving through the interstellar medium like `` bullets '' .    the line ratios of the nw knot of hu1 - 2 and those from the collimated outflows of other pne are generally consistent with those of other low - ionization structures , but they exhibit higher [ o  iii]/h@xmath4 ratios .",
    "this line ratio is particularly high in hu1 - 2 , indicating that both low- and high - excitation gas are present at the location of this feature with significant amounts . the observed line ratios of the nw knot of hu1 - 2 have been modeled using `` ad  hoc '' simulations of a fast moving cloudlet in a medium with homogeneous density .",
    "the model predictions are generally consistent with the observed line ratios , thus confirming that the excitation of the bipolar knots of hu1 - 2 can be explained by a mix of the uv radiation and shocks .",
    "the models favor distance , nebular abundances , and stellar parameters consistent with those derived for hu1 - 2 . as reported for the collimated outflows of other pne and proto - pne ( e.g. , hen3 - 1475 ; riera et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the best knot velocity ( 100250 kms@xmath1 ) inferred from the models is below that derived by spatio - kinematical studies ( @xmath0340 km  s@xmath1 ) .    finally , we estimated the ionized mass of the nw knot of hu1 - 2 , and calculated the jets mechanical luminosity using the knots mass and the ejection time - scale based on the dynamical age of the bipolar outflow .",
    "the jets mechanical luminosity and the mass - loss rate of hu1 - 2 generally agree , within the uncertainties , with those of the necklace and ngc6778 , both of which have a post - common envelope close binary central star . the resemblance of hu1 - 2 with ngc6778 in nebular structure and morphology hints at a possibility that the former might have similar jet - launching engine as the latter .",

    "<S> generally hu1 - 2 has high he / h ( @xmath20.14 ) and n / o ratios ( @xmath20.9 ) , typical of type  i pne . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , its abundances of o , ne , s , and ar are low as compared with the average abundances of galactic bulge and disc pne . </S>",
    "<S> the position - velocity maps can be generally described as an hour - glass shaped nebula with bipolar expansion , although the morphology and kinematics of the innermost regions can not be satisfactorily explained with a simple , tilted equatorial torus . </S>",
    "<S> the spatio - kinematical study confines the inclination angle of its major axis to be within 10@xmath3 of the plane of sky . as in the irradiated bow - shocks of ic4634 and ngc7009 </S>",
    "<S> , there is a clear stratification in the emission peaks of [ o  iii ] , h@xmath4 , and [ n  ii ] in the northwest ( nw ) knot of hu1 - 2 . </S>",
    "<S> fast collimated outflows in pne exhibit higher excitation than other low - ionization structures . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly the case for the bipolar knots of hu1 - 2 , with he  ii emission levels above those of collimated outflows in other galactic pne . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation of the knots in hu1 - 2 is consistent with the combined effects of shocks and uv radiation from the central star . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical energy and luminosity of the knots are similar to those observed in the pne known to harbor a post - common envelope ( post - ce ) close binary central star .    [ firstpage ]    ism : abundances  ism : jets and outflows  </S>",
