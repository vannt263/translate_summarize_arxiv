    "time reversal invariant ( tri ) topological superconductor ( tsc ) , which was proposed as a generalization of the tri topological insulator ( ti ) , has become a research focus of condensed matter physics.@xcite one promising candidate of tri tsc is cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1@xcite , which is also the first superconductor ( sc ) realized from a three dimensional ( 3d ) ti .",
    "intensive subsequent searches have added to the candidate list of tri tsc the bi@xmath0x@xmath1 ( x is se or te ) under high pressure@xcite and the in - doped snte@xcite .",
    "a common feature of these scs is that , their normal phases are described by the same kind of low energy effective model@xcite , which we call here as the generalized bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model.@xcite    one of the most remarkable features of tri tsc is that they support surface andreev bound states ( sabss ) known as majorana fermions , which are promising candidates for realizing the fault - tolerant topological quantum computations.@xcite the sabss are also essential to various transport properties , such as the tunneling spectroscopy.@xcite several candidate pairings for cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and similar materials are known to support sabss.@xcite an interesting feature of the sabss for some topological nontrivial pairings of superconducting tis ( stis ) is that , they connect continuously to the topological surface states ( tsss ) inherited from the normal phase ( henceforth called sabs - tss connection).@xcite while this feature was explained as an accidental crossing between the sabss and the tsss@xcite , and also in terms of mirror symmetry breaking by the pairing@xcite , whether or not it occurs for all pairings that support sabss is still unclear.@xcite besides , it is not clear from the existing works whether new kinds of sabss can be expected for pairings realized in the generalized bhz model . since the generalized bhz model is a two - orbital model , it is not easy to extract physics by working with the full model directly . a simple picture for the pairings in these materials that can give a fast and reliable answer for the existence and property of the sabss is thus highly desired .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a simple and unified way to understand the low energy properties of these exotic scs , the stis in particular .",
    "exploiting the close analogy between tis and single orbital tri tscs , we show that if a pairing in the two - orbital generalized bhz model is topological nontrivial , the full model can be reduced to low energy effective models corresponding to conventional @xmath3 wave triplet scs , all well - known in the study of @xmath4he.@xcite the normal state z@xmath0 topological order @xcite is found _ not _ essential for a certain pairing to be topological .",
    "however , for z@xmath0 nontrivial normal state , the topological pairing can own one or two kramers pairs of sabss , depending on the relative position of the chemical potential with respect to the bands .",
    "in addition , we show that the sabs - tss connection is a universal character of stis . thus , this new approach not only provides a unified picture for pairings in two - orbital bhz type models and in one - orbital models but also provides a very useful and intuitive way to understand the low energy properties ( e.g. , sabss ) of stis and related scs in terms of well - known prototypes .    in the rest of the paper ,",
    "we first present the model , the main results and related discussions in sec.ii .",
    "then we give a short summary in sec.iii .",
    "the technical details are provided in the appendices .",
    "bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and other relevant materials are well described by a minimal two - orbital @xmath5 model which can be regarded as a 3d generalization of the two dimensional ( 2d ) bhz model.@xcite this model can be mapped to a 3d hexagonal lattice.@xcite define the basis vector for a wave vector @xmath6 in the hexagonal bz as @xmath7 $ ] , in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 operators correspond to the two orbitals , the hamiltonian matrix is written as@xcite @xmath10+c_{z}(\\mathbf{k})\\sigma_{2}\\otimes s_{0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13=1,2,3 ) are pauli matrices in the spin and orbital subspaces , respectively . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are 2 by 2 unit matrices .",
    "the inversion operator is @xmath16.@xcite in this orbital convention , @xmath8 and @xmath9 have even and odd parities , respectively.@xcite a slightly different model , with the @xmath17 term in eq.(1 ) replaced by @xmath18 , is also widely used in the literature.@xcite this modified model ( henceforth called modified eq.(1 ) ) , though does not respect the mirror symmetry of actual materials@xcite , does describe a ti.@xcite we would consider mostly eq.(1 ) and sometimes also use the modified model in our analysis . take lattice parameters as length units , we have @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is obtained from @xmath22 by substituting @xmath23 for @xmath24 and describes a topologically trivial band shift .",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "two ingredients are known to be essential to make the ( generalized ) bhz model a description of tis.@xcite the first is the existence of couplings between the two orbitals , which must be odd functions of @xmath6 since @xmath8 and @xmath9 are of opposite parity and the materials have inversion symmetry .",
    "this is embodied in the @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) terms originating from spin - orbit interaction.@xcite the other is the existence of _ band inversion _ ( bi ) , in which the ordering of the two orbitals are inverted somewhere in the bz , satisfied when @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath13=1,2 ) are not too large.@xcite    we now review and emphasize the similarity between tis , focusing on the generalized bhz model , and one - orbital tri tscs.@xcite historically , tri tscs were found decades ago ( e.g. , the bw phase of @xmath4he@xcite ) and were reformulated recently in close analogy to tis.@xcite the analogy is rooted in the similarity between the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian for a sc and the hamiltonian for a band insulator . to establish a formal equivalence in terms of eq.(1 ) for the generalized bhz model ,",
    "let us set the topologically irrelevant @xmath21 term to zero hereafter in this work ( see appendix d for an analysis of this approximation ) .",
    "then make a rotation of @xmath32 round the @xmath33 axis in the spin subspace by @xmath34 , and a further substitution of @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 which amounts to a rotation of @xmath32 round @xmath38 axis in the @xmath6 space , eq.(1 ) becomes @xmath39 .",
    "now , reinterpret the @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals as the particle and hole bands in a single band sc , and noting that @xmath40 ( @xmath29 ) for @xmath41 , the above model is _ exactly _ the bdg hamiltonian of the bw state , up to an anisotropy between the @xmath42 plane and the @xmath43 direction.@xcite for the modified eq.(1 ) , if we first change the basis for @xmath9 orbital to @xmath44= [ b^{\\dagger}_{\\mathbf{k}\\uparrow},b^{\\dagger}_{\\mathbf{k}\\downarrow}]is_{2}$ ] and then make the substitution of @xmath45 for @xmath37 and @xmath35 for @xmath45 , we obtain the same model obtained above from eq.(1 ) . in this reinterpretation of ( modified ) eq.(1 ) , the bi condition amounts to the weak pairing condition , that is the chemical potential ( played by @xmath46 ) must cross the conduction or valence band@xcite , and the linear in @xmath6 couplings between @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals amount to @xmath3 wave pairing between the equivalent particle and hole bands , which is triplet in nature in this new interpretation . by analogy with bi in ti ,",
    "we call hereafter the weak pairing condition in terms of _ particle hole inversion _ ( phi ) .",
    "so , it is clear from the above analogy that tri tsc in single band ( orbital ) models can occur only for triplet pairings and when phi occurs .    after establishing the analogy between tis and tri tscs , we study pairings formed in the generalized bhz model . introducing the nambu basis @xmath47 $ ] and a pairing term @xmath48 , the bdg hamiltonian is@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the chemical potential .     term discarded . in each pair of figures in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c )",
    ", the left one shows the relative position of @xmath22 ( the upward parabola ) and @xmath51 ( the downward parabola ) , the right one shows the relative position of the bulk conduction band ( the upward parabola ) and bulk valence band ( the downward parabola ) , in the normal phase .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines show positions of the chemical potential taken in this work .",
    "the two crossing points on each figure between the vertical dashed line and the two curves label the extremal points of @xmath52 or the bulk conduction and valence bands . in this work ,",
    "the extremal points for the right figure of ( c ) correspond to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , whereas they correspond to @xmath55 for all other figures ( see appendix e).,width=302,height=226 ]    we first study an interorbital triplet pairing which is topological nontrivial and have attracted the most attention to date , written as @xmath56.@xcite as in all previous works , we first set @xmath50 far away from the ti gap center where the bi occurs.@xcite without loss of generality , we first set the parameters as @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61.@xcite as shown in fig.1(a ) for a schematic drawing of this parameter set , only the @xmath8 orbital crosses @xmath50 and makes a phi . though the pairing operator contains the two orbitals on an equal footing , the @xmath9 orbital only sees a strong pairing field ( in the naming convention of read and green@xcite ) and thus can not hold a topological pairing.@xcite to be more specific , in terms of the nambu description , the pairing introduces a hole orbital for both the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 particle orbitals . while the particle and hole @xmath8 orbitals meet and invert at @xmath50 ,",
    "the particle and hole @xmath9 orbitals are both far away from @xmath50 , as shown in fig .",
    "thus , the low energy quasiparticle excitations close to @xmath50 should be associated mostly with the @xmath8 orbital .",
    "since we are interested only in low energy properties , in particular the sabss , we could integrate out the high energy degrees of freedom corresponding to the @xmath9 orbital , and work with a low energy effective model associated _ mainly _ with the @xmath8 orbital .    to simplify the deductions ,",
    "we redefine the nambu basis as @xmath62 $ ] , with @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 similarly .",
    "labeled by the @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals , the bdg hamiltonian @xmath65 is written into block form . the upper - left diagonal block for the @xmath8 orbital is @xmath66s_{0}\\otimes\\tau_{3}$ ] , the lower - right diagonal block for the @xmath9 orbital is @xmath67s_{0}\\otimes\\tau_{3}$ ] , the off - diagonal blocks are @xmath68 . to get the low energy effective model within the @xmath8 orbital ,",
    "we suppose @xmath69^{\\text{t}}$ ] is an eigenfunction of @xmath65 with energy @xmath70 .",
    "thus we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "eliminate @xmath73 , we get the eigen - equation for @xmath8 orbital as @xmath74u_{a}=\\tilde{h}_{a}u_{a}=eu_{a}$ ] .",
    "@xmath75 is the low energy effective model that we want.@xcite since we focus on states with @xmath76 , for small pairing amplitudes we could set @xmath77 in @xmath75 which amounts to neglecting small quantities proportional to @xmath78 and their higher order terms ( see appendix c ) .",
    "thus we get the low energy effective model within the @xmath8 orbital subspace as @xmath79s_{0}\\otimes\\tau_{3 }    \\notag \\\\ & & -\\frac{2\\delta_{0}}{m+\\mu } [ c_{x}s_{3}\\otimes\\tau_{1}+c_{y}s_{0}\\otimes\\tau_{2}-c_{z}s_{1}\\otimes\\tau_{1}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have made the @xmath6 dependencies of the various terms implicit . a moment",
    "s reflection by taking into account the fact that @xmath40 for @xmath41 can convince one that , up to an anisotropy between the @xmath42 plane and the @xmath43 direction , the effective triplet pairing in eq.(3 ) describes the well - known bw phase.@xcite    according to the two criteria for identifying tscs in a one - orbital model , we have to see whether a phi still occurs in the effective model , that is whether or not @xmath80 changes sign somewhere in the bz , if @xmath81 changes sign in the bz .",
    "we have found that , once @xmath82 is small compared to @xmath83 evaluated at wave vectors satisfying @xmath84 , phi always occurs in the effective model ( see appendix d ) .",
    "this is consistent with our assumption of small @xmath82 and relevant experiments.@xcite recalling the identification to the bw phase , we know from previous works that , this pairing is fully gapped and is topologically nontrivial supporting sabss on an arbitrary surface.@xcite    furthermore , it is easy to see that phi in the effective model occurs regardless of the value of @xmath85 and thus occurs even for @xmath86 ( no bi in the normal phase , see fig.1(b ) for a schematic illustration ) which corresponds to a topologically trivial normal phase , such as sb@xmath0se@xmath1.@xcite",
    "so , @xmath87 is tsc even if the normal phase is topologically trivial . to verify this result",
    ", we show in figs.2(a ) and 2(b ) numerical results of the surface spectral functions for @xmath30 and @xmath86 , respectively.@xcite in the small wave vector region , linearly dispersing sabss appear in both two cases .",
    "the only qualitative difference appears close to the fermi momentum , where the sabss for a ti normal phase ( @xmath30 ) connects continuously to the tsss .",
    "on account of this finding , ordinary semiconductors like sb@xmath0se@xmath1 with strong soi are also promising candidates to find topological pairings.@xcite     in eq.(1 ) , for four parameter sets ( neglecting the @xmath21 term ) : ( a ) @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath88 ; ( b ) @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath89 , @xmath61 , and @xmath88 ; ( c ) @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath90 , @xmath60 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 ; ( d ) @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath93 , @xmath60 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "the results are obtained in terms of standard iterative green s function method.@xcite the darker the color , the larger the spectral weight.,width=325,height=272 ]    since the low energy effective models for the tsc phase within the @xmath8 orbital are essentially the same for @xmath30 and @xmath86 , we are led to conclude that the parts of the two kinds of sabss which have their origin in the tsc states are equivalent , and the additional feature for @xmath30 in fig.2(a ) close to the fermi momentum is a result of hybridization between the sabss and the tsss .",
    "the merge of sabs with tsss is because on one hand the pairing @xmath96 can not open a gap within the tsss and on the other hand the tsss are well separated from the bulk states and thus well defined at @xmath50.@xcite later in this work we would show that the sabs - tss connection is likely a universal feature of sti.@xcite    apart from the merge of sabs with tsss , there is another important difference between @xmath30 and @xmath86 . for @xmath86 without of bi , phi can only occur for a single orbital .",
    "but for @xmath30 with bi , phi can occur for both of the two orbitals if @xmath97 or @xmath98 , and if we place @xmath50 properly ( @xmath50 should cross one bulk band to ensure bulk pairing ) within the region of @xmath99 ( see appendix e for more detailed explanations ) . see fig.1(c ) for a schematic illustration of the situation in the normal phase . in this case , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals both contribute nontrivially to the superconducting phase low energy excitations . for @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    "never change sign at the same wave vector ( see the left figure of fig.1(c ) for an illustration of @xmath103 ) .",
    "so , phi for orbitals @xmath8 and @xmath9 occur at different portions of the bz , which we denote as bz@xmath104 and bz@xmath105 . for @xmath106 ,",
    "bz@xmath104 and bz@xmath105 share no common wave vectors .",
    "we are thus justified to get two low energy effective models @xmath75 and @xmath107 in bz@xmath104 and bz@xmath105 , respectively .",
    "still consider @xmath87 , @xmath75 is as shown in eq.(3 ) .",
    "@xmath107 is obtained from eq.(3 ) by making the substitution of @xmath108 $ ] . as a result",
    ", there would be two pairs of sabss on each surface , originating separately from @xmath75 and @xmath107 .",
    "the coupling between bz@xmath104 and bz@xmath105 , upon the introduction of the surface , would induce hybridization between the two pairs of sabss , so that the energies of the sabss at the time reversal invariant momentum of the surface bz ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) would be nonzero . as shown in figs.2(c ) and 2(d ) are results for two typical parameter sets .",
    "the presence of two pairs of sabss , and the nonzero excitation energies for @xmath53 are both obvious , which are easily understood with our low energy effective model approach .",
    "more discussions for the sabss can be found in appendix f. the finding of two pairs of sabss is new in the present system and never shown before . since in actual tis , like bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are small enough and satisfy the conditions @xmath97 or @xmath98@xcite , it is quite possible to observe two pairs of sabs in experiments if the chemical potential is chosen properly .",
    "so far we have shown with @xmath96 as an example that the tscs emerging from the generalized bhz model can be understood clearly through the low energy effective models .",
    "this analysis is easily extended to other pairings .",
    "we would concentrate in the following on the cases in which bi occurs in the normal phase ( @xmath30 ) and only the @xmath8 orbital has a phi ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "two other triplet pairings are known to support nontrivial sabss , which are @xmath112 and @xmath113.@xcite following the same analysis as above , we can get their low energy effective models .",
    "the effective pairings within the @xmath8 orbital subspace for @xmath114 and @xmath115 turn out to be equivalent to the planar phase of @xmath116he@xcite in the @xmath117 and @xmath118 plane , respectively ( see appendix a ) .",
    "an odd parity singlet pairing , @xmath119 is also of interest to us .",
    "direct calculation ( see appendix a ) shows that the low energy effective pairing within the @xmath8 orbital is also similar to the planar phase of @xmath116he , but within the @xmath42 plane.@xcite since this effective pairing does not change sign across the @xmath120 surface , it would not give sabss lying in the @xmath120 plane .",
    "but if a clean surface parallel to the @xmath121 axis can be prepared , this pairing should also give sabss similar to the above two triplet pairings.@xcite    recently , we have proposed a novel spin singlet pairing which gives flat - band sabss , for cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and bi@xmath0te@xmath1.@xcite in the present convention , it is defined as @xmath122 , where @xmath123\\sim k_{y}$ ] ( or @xmath124 ) .",
    "the low energy effective model for this pairing turns out to be @xmath125 ( or @xmath126 ) wave singlet pairing ( see appendix a ) . in terms of this correspondence ,",
    "the sabss in this pairing is similar to the sabss in cuprates.@xcite    it is now clear that pairing in the low energy effective model can be quite different from its original form .",
    "this originates from the inherent intricate couplings among the degrees of freedom in the model .",
    "hence , a subtle change of these couplings would manifest itself in the change of the low - energy effective models , even if the topological ( e.g. , z@xmath0 ) nature of the normal phase remains unchanged .",
    "we illustrate this point by studying typical pairings formed in the modified eq.(1 ) .",
    "first consider @xmath96 .",
    "the low energy effective model is easily obtained . instead of a bw type pairing ,",
    "the effective pairing in the low energy model is equivalent to the planar phase of @xmath4he , within the @xmath42 plane ( see appendix b).@xcite since the order parameter does not change sign across the @xmath120 plane , no sabss are expected in direct contrast to the original model of eq.(1).@xcite now , consider the odd - parity singlet pairing @xmath127 .",
    "the low energy effective pairing within the @xmath8 orbital turns out to be equivalent to the bw phase by a proper redefinition of axes ( see appendix b ) , in comparison to the planar phase in the original model of eq.(1).@xcite thus we have seen a slight difference in the original model of eq.(1 ) and the modified eq.(1 ) will give very different sabss . thus specific coupling among the degrees of freedom",
    "determines the topological nature of a pairing .",
    "we now come back to eq.(1 ) and answer whether or not sabss will always merge with tsss in stis that support sabss , and tsss are well separated from the bulk band states at @xmath50.@xcite this question can be answered by thinking reversely : if all pairings that can open a gap in the tsss do not support sabss on the @xmath120 surface , then all pairings supporting sabss on the @xmath120 surface can not open gap in the tsss , hence the two different surface states will merge .    to test the above statement",
    ", we first construct the tri pairing that can form in the tsss.@xcite the tsss on the @xmath120 surface of a sample occupying the @xmath128 half space are obtained by solving the surface modes in terms of the continuum limit of eq.(1).@xcite denoting the surface states in terms of the basis @xmath129 by making the @xmath121 dependency implicit , the two zero energy modes for @xmath53 are found to be @xmath130 $ ] and @xmath131 $ ] . the effective model for the tsss is@xcite @xmath132 where @xmath6 is now defined in the surface bz .",
    "its two eigenvectors can be taken as @xmath133^{\\text{t}}$ ] , with @xmath134 and the corresponding eigenenergies @xmath135 .",
    "the creation operators for the eigenstates are thus @xmath136 $ ] .    without loss of generality , consider pairing in the tsss for @xmath103 .",
    "the tri pairing then must come in the form of @xmath137.@xcite in terms of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 operators , this pairing can be decomposed into two singlet and two triplet pairings .",
    "one singlet pairing is @xmath138 . for this pairing , the low energy effective pairing for the @xmath8 orbital",
    "is an @xmath139 wave singlet pairing with slight anisotropy and thus do not support sabss ( see appendix a ) .",
    "another singlet pairing is @xmath127 studied earlier .",
    "this phase , though not completely topologically trivial , does not support sabss on the @xmath120 surface .",
    "the two triplet pairings are both similar to the planar phase of @xmath4he , including one intraorbital and one interorbital component .",
    "the interorbital component is @xmath140is_{2}$ ] .",
    "the effective pairing within the @xmath8 orbital subspace is proportional to @xmath141is_{2}$ ] , an anisotropic @xmath139 wave pairing of approximately @xmath142 symmetry ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this pairing is thus trivial and does not support sabss on any surface .",
    "the intraorbital component is @xmath143is_{2}$ ] .",
    "the low energy effective model for @xmath144 describes a planar state in the @xmath42 plane , and thus does not support sabss on the @xmath120 surface ( see appendix a ) .    because the above four pairings exhaust the pairings that can open gap within the tsss ( @xmath120 surface ) yet none of them support sabss on the @xmath120 surface , any pairing that supports sabss on the @xmath120 surface can not open gap within the tsss .",
    "thus , in the assumed situation of well defined tsss separated from the bulk band states , the sabss if exist will merge with the tsss .",
    "we would like to point out that , though all pairings supporting sabss do not open gap within the tsss , the tsss are modified by the pairing through coupling with the bulk states . the detailed analysis will be presented in a later work .",
    "to summarize , we propose and illustrate how the superconducting phases of the generalized bhz model , a description of pairings in stis and scs realized from semiconductors with large spin orbit interaction , can be understood easily in terms of low energy effective models , constructed following the guide of analogy between ti and one orbital tscs .",
    "several predictions are made following this new approach .",
    "the normal state topological order is not essential for a pairing to be topologically nontrivial .",
    "whereas the delicate couplings of degrees of freedom in the model are of crucial importance . for ti normal phase , tscs may host one copy or two copies of sabss , depending on the chemical potential .",
    "the previously found sabs - tss connection structure is shown to be a universal feature of stis .",

    "the two pairs of zero modes originate separately from coupling among states of orbital @xmath8 in bz@xmath104 and states of orbital @xmath9 in bz@xmath105 . introducing the coupling of @xmath331 between states of orbital @xmath8 in bz@xmath104 and states of orbital @xmath9 in bz@xmath105 mixes the two pairs of sabss . for @xmath53 ,",

    "by creating a pair of surfaces , @xmath43 is not still a good quantum number and should be replaced by @xmath342 .",

    "the dispersion of the actual sabss close to @xmath53 are thus obtained after we make a reasonable estimation for the coupling between the two pairs of sabss solved from @xmath387 and @xmath388 .",
    "there are two equivalent yet slightly different methods to make this estimation , which we explain in turn .",
    "the first method is to calculate the matrix elements of the original bulk hamiltonian ( with a pair of @xmath120 surfaces introduced and thus @xmath43 is to be replaced by @xmath342 ) between the basis @xmath380 for @xmath387 and the basis @xmath385 for @xmath388 .",
    "we define the matrix element to be calculated between @xmath348 ( @xmath344 ) and @xmath389 ( @xmath390 ) as @xmath391 .",
    "there are four terms in the bulk hamiltonian of @xmath87 that are relevant to the coupling between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals , which are @xmath392 in the four terms of @xmath393 , we have made their dependencies on the wave vectors explicit .",
    "note that the effect of coupling between orbital @xmath8 and orbital @xmath9 is already incorporated in obtaining the _ bulk _ low energy effective models @xmath75 within bz@xmath104 and @xmath107 within bz@xmath105 .",
    "what we are now trying to estimate is the the coupling between states in bz@xmath104 and states in bz@xmath105 induced by the broken translational invariance along the @xmath121 direction , so the @xmath43 dependent term is the _ only _ term relevant to our objective .",
    "this term is no other than @xmath292 defined in eq.(18 ) . for @xmath43 very small , we can make the approximation @xmath394 .",
    "the breaking of translational invariance along @xmath121 direction is accompanied by the substitution of @xmath395 in @xmath292 .",
    "direct calculation shows that @xmath396 , and @xmath397 thus , in the basis of @xmath398 the complete form of the effective model for the sabss is @xmath399 dispersion of the sabss close to the @xmath53 point is obtained by diagonalizing the above @xmath400 matrix , which give four branches of excitations @xmath401 where @xmath134 and @xmath309 .",
    "this result gives a pair of two fold degenerate states of energy @xmath402 and @xmath403 at @xmath53 , which split separately into a pair of linearly dispersive modes for small @xmath267 .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the dispersions of the sabss in figs.2(c ) and 2(d ) . substituting the parameters for figs.2(c ) and 2(d ) to eq.(f29 ) , we get @xmath404 and @xmath405 , respectively . in comparison to the numerical values of @xmath406 and @xmath407 , we see that the estimations are in the correct order of magnitude . in particular",
    ", the estimation from the analytical calculation for fig.2(c ) is very close to the numerical results , while the estimation for fig.2(d ) is a little inferior .",
    "this is because the parameters for fig.2(c ) matches the two conditions of the analytical derivations , small @xmath82 and small @xmath335 , better than the parameters of fig.2(d ) .",
    "the approximately constant slope of the analytical dispersion at small @xmath408 for branch @xmath409 is @xmath410 , which is about 80@xmath411 of the numerical value for both fig.2(c ) and fig.2(d ) .    the second method of estimating the coupling between the two pairs of sabss emerging from @xmath412 and @xmath413 is to apply eqs.(f7 ) and ( f9 ) .",
    "to begin , we express the basis @xmath380 for @xmath412 and @xmath385 for @xmath413 in lattice representation .",
    "similar to the first part of this section , we denote the numbering of the layers in terms of @xmath301 .",
    "to study the surface states on the upper surface of a sample with @xmath277 layers ( assuming @xmath414 ) , we set @xmath305 as the upmost layer and @xmath304 as the bottom layer . in the case of periodic boundary conditions , @xmath295 is identified with @xmath304 . in the case of open boundary conditions , @xmath295 is considered as a fictitious layer outside of the sample and just above of the @xmath305 layer . then the surface modes in eqs.(f19 ) and ( f21 ) become @xmath415 and @xmath416 where @xmath134 .",
    "the boundary condition of @xmath417 are ensured in the form of @xmath418 .",
    "note that @xmath419 and @xmath420 are expressed in the basis of @xmath421 ( denoted as @xmath422 hereafter ) and @xmath423 ( denoted as @xmath424 hereafter ) @xmath425 , the four wave functions in eqs.(f32 ) and ( f33 ) are written in operator form as @xmath426 and @xmath427 to apply eqs.(f7 ) and ( f9 ) , we turn the lattice representation of eqs.(f34 ) and ( f35 ) to wave vector representation .",
    "since @xmath75 and @xmath107 are well defined only within bz@xmath104 and bz@xmath105 , @xmath428 and @xmath428 ( @xmath134 ) should also contain states restricted within bz@xmath104 and bz@xmath105 .",
    "recalling the former analysis , there are approximately @xmath429 ( denoted as @xmath430 in what follows ) states in bz@xmath104 and @xmath431 ( denoted as @xmath432 in what follows ) states in bz@xmath105 . similar to the fourier transformation for states defined in the whole bz , we can make the following transformations @xmath433 substituting the above transformation to eqs.(f34 ) and ( f35 ) , we get after finishing the summation over @xmath301 from @xmath304 to @xmath305 @xmath434 and @xmath435 in deriving the above results , we have exploited the condition of @xmath414 , so that @xmath436 and @xmath437 ( @xmath134 ) are all essentially zero .    with eqs.(f37 ) and ( f38 ) at hand , it is now strait - forward to estimate the coupling between @xmath438 and @xmath439 in terms of eqs.(f7 ) and ( f9 ) . here , we define the matrix element between @xmath440 ( @xmath344 ) and @xmath441 ( @xmath390 ) as @xmath442",
    ". it is shown through direct calculation that @xmath443 and @xmath444 .",
    "so , we get an effective model for the sabss similar to eq.(f30 ) , with @xmath445 replaced by @xmath446 .",
    "the final form for @xmath446 is however more complicated than @xmath445 and is @xmath447 since the above formula depends on the two parameters @xmath279 and @xmath286 defined in eqs.(f1 ) and ( f2 ) , whose values lack a reliable criterion to determine , we can not make an easy estimation of its value .",
