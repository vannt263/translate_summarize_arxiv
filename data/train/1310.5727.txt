    "the theory of topological phases of matter has been a central problem in condensed matter physics since the discovery of the quantum hall effects@xcite in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) in large magnetic fields .",
    "the precisely observed ( quantized or fractional ) values of the hall conductance is a manifestation of the fact that it is a topological invariant of the incompressible fluid.@xcite the fractional quantum hall fluids , on the other hand , are explained by the universal properties encoded in the structure of their wave functions@xcite whose excitations ( vortices ) carry fractional charge and fractional statistics.@xcite the robustness of these properties a consequence of their topological character .",
    "in addition to having fractionalized excitations , these topological fluids have a ground state degeneracy which depends on the topology of the surface on which they reside , which is not a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of any global symmetry.@xcite the universal behavior of these topological fluids is encoded in an effective low - energy , the chern - simons gauge theory.@xcite    there is now a growing body of ( mostly theoretical ) evidence that such topological phases of matter exist in several models of frustrated quantum antiferromagnets@xcite and in quantum dimer models.@xcite the recent discovery of topological insulators@xcite has opened a new arena in which these ideas play out . interacting versions of simple models of topological chern insulators , such as the haldane model,@xcite have topological phases with fractionalized excitations.@xcite    an interesting question is the interlay and possible coexistence of topological order and spontaneous symmetry breaking . for some filling fraction the 2deg",
    "is known to have a ferromagnetic quantum hall ground state,@xcite in which spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "also , a state with a nematic `` valley '' order has also been seen in quantum hall fluids on misoriented samples.@xcite on the other hand , experiments in the 2deg in the second landau level found a nematic state in a regime in which the fractional ( and integer ) quantum hall effect is absent.@xcite in this phase the 2deg is an uniform gapless electron fluid with a spontaneously broken spatial rotational symmetry.@xcite    recent experiments by xia and coworkers found that the 2deg in the first landau level in tilted magnetic fields has a strong tendency to break rotational invariance inside an incompressible fractional quantum hall laughlin state.@xcite although in the the experiments rotational invariance is broken explicitly by the tilted magnetic field , the temperature dependence of the transport anisotropy suggest that this state has a large nematic susceptibility and may be close to a phase transition to a nematic state .",
    "these experiments motivated mulligan , kachru and nayak to develop a theory in which nematic order coexists with a fractional quantum hall fluid.@xcite the possible existence of such states was anticipated by two early proposals of wave functions for anisotropic quantum hall fluids.@xcite    the experiments of xia and coworkers have also motivated the inquiry of the role of more microscopic , `` geometrical '' , degrees of freedom in the physics of these topological fluids.@xcite recently , maciejko and coworkers proposed an effective field theory of the anisotropic fractional quantum hall state.@xcite using mainly symmetry arguments , they found that the nematic order parameter couples to the fractional quantum hall fluid in the same way as the space components of a metric tensor .",
    "a similar effect was found earlier in a theory of a nematic charge @xmath2 superconductor@xcite involving , instead , the order parameter field of the superconductor . a key result of ref .",
    "[ ] is that the dynamics of the nematic degrees of freedom is governed by a berry phase term in the effective action whose coefficient is the hall viscosity of the topological fluid.@xcite    there are many aspects of this problem which remain unclear . in the case of the 2deg",
    "the existence of a compressible nematic phase ( in the second landau level ) suggests that it must be related to the anisotropy seen in the first landau level , albeit in the incompressible phase .",
    "the theory of ref .",
    "[ ] suggests a possible mechanism ( and an identification of the nematic degrees of freedom ) solely in terms of the low - energy degrees of freedom of the quantum hall fluid , but runs into difficulties in systems with galilean invariance .",
    "in addition , that theory should also apply to the case of the integer quantum hall effect .",
    "although it is possible to write down a wave function for an anisotropic quantum hall state by breaking rotational invariance explicitly at the microscopic level,@xcite such an approach does not explain how it may come about from an isotropic incompressible state .    in this paper we will investigate these problems by deriving an effective field theory for a mott chern insulator in a nematic phase in a a simple microscopic lattice model recently proposed in by sun and coworkers.@xcite we will discuss in detail the case of the 2deg in magnetic fields in a separate publication.@xcite the model of ref .",

    "the quadratic band crossing is protected by the @xmath3 point group symmetry of square lattice and by time - reversal invariance .    due to the quadratic band crossing",
    ", this electronic system has a dynamical scaling exponent @xmath1 ( i.e. the energy scales with the square of the momentum ) . as a direct consequence of the @xmath1 scaling ,",
    "four fermion operators are naively marginal operators .",
    "this free - fermion system , which can be regarded as a fermionic version of a quantum lifshitz model,@xcite is at an infrared unstable fixed point of the renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "this semimetal fixed point is unstable to infinitesimal repulsive interactions to a ) a gapped phase with a spontaneously broker time - reversal invariance , i.e. a topological mott chern insulator with a spontaneous quantum anomalous hall state@xcite , b ) to a gapless semimetal nematic phase in which the point group symmetry breaks spontaneously from @xmath3 down to @xmath4 , and c ) to a gapped phase in which both time reversal symmetry - breaking and the point group symmetry breaking coexist.@xcite    models with quadratic band crossings describe the low - energy description of graphene bilayers,@xcite where there are two such crossings , and in the topologically protected surface states of 3d topological crystalline insulators.@xcite we discuss below some caveats on the relevance of this model to such systems .",
    "in particular , a ( mott ) chern insulating state has been conjectured to exist in bilayer graphene.@xcite    due to the marginal relevance of local interactions , the behavior of the system in these phases can be investigated using controlled approximations , such as @xmath0 expansions and perturbative rg calculations .",
    "in contrast , in the case of the massless dirac fermion , local interactions are irrelevant and a finite ( and typically large ) critical value of the coupling constant is need to drive the system into a mott chern insulating phase.@xcite here we will use the @xmath0 expansion and bosonization methods to derive an effective field theory of the mott chern insulator and of its quantum phase transition to a nematic chern insulator in the context of the model of ref . [ ] . the effective field theory includes a the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom of the conserved currents of the fermions , in the form of a bf / chern - simons gauge theory , and the local fluctuations of the nematic order parameter .",
    "in particular in this theory the nematic fluctuations are present at low energies which is required to describe a continuous quantum phase transition to a nematic mott chern insulator .",
    "we will also show that the effective low - energy dynamics of the nematic order parameter is indeed a berry phase term , with a structure similar to that proposed by maciejko and collaborators .",
    "we also find that the nematic fields can be regarded as providing a local fluctuating spatial metric for the hydrodynamic gauge fields of the mott chern insulator .",
    "however we will also show that the nematic degrees of freedom do not couple to the fermionic degrees of freedom as a local frame field and hence , they can not be identified with a local geometry .",
    "we show that the hall viscosity , which in system of spinors is the response of the system to a change of the local frames@xcite ( i.e. a long - wavelength distortion of the lattice ) , is not equal to the berry phase of the nematic modes . instead , the berry phase is related to the concept of torque hall viscosity which we introduce here .",
    "in addition , we find that in this system the hall viscosity is not given by the coefficient of the @xmath5 term in the hall conductance .",
    "recently , hoyos and son showed that in galilean - invariant one - component quantum hall fluids systems these two coefficients should be equal to each other.@xcite these assumptions do not apply to multi - component fermionic ( spinor ) systems as in the present case .",
    "we also find that the hall viscosity and the berry phase coefficient are related to the hall torque viscosity .",

    "we present the model of interacting fermions in two dimensions with a quadratic band crossing and we discuss its phase diagram . in section [ sec : effective - field - theory ] we develop an effective field theory of the interplay of nematic order and of the hydrodynamic gauge theory .",
    "in section [ sec:1/n ] we use the @xmath0 expansion to derive the effective action in the vicinity of the nematic transition inside the spontaneous quantum anomalous hall phase , and use it to discuss briefly the nature of the two phases and the quantum and thermal critical behavior . in section [ sec : nematic - effective - action ] we present the effective field theory of the nematic fields in the presence of broken time - reversal invariance . here",

    "this lattice has two sublattices , and the single - particle states are two - component spinors .",
    "the band structure of this system is described by the tight - binding one - particle hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 are vectors of the first brillouin zone ( bz ) , @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two ( real symmetric , @xmath12 ) pauli matrices .",
    "the lattice model also has a contribution proportional to the @xmath13 identity matrix which , for a range of parameters , can be ignored.@xcite tsai and coworkers@xcite discussed a similar problem on the lieb lattice .    in this system",
    "the two bands cross at the fermi energy at the corners of the bz , @xmath14 ( and its symmetry related points ) . for a half - filled system ,",
    "the fermi energy is exactly at the band crossing points , and the ground state of the non - interacting system describes a semi - metal with a quadratic band dispersion .",
    "similar problems have been discussed in the context of bilayer graphene.@xcite    the band structure of this semi - metal has a non - trivial berry phase @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a bloch state at momentum @xmath17 of the bz , and @xmath18 is a closed curve on the bz that encloses the quadratic band crossing point , @xmath14 . for a two - band system with a qbc the integer @xmath19 ( @xmath20 for dirac fermions ) . in this case",
    "the changes of the chern number of the two bands are carried entirely by the ( single ) quadratic crossing . at the non - interacting level",
    ", the berry phase here is protected by both discrete lattice symmetries and by time reversal invariance .    for momenta @xmath21 close to the crossing points ( the corners of the bz ) we can approximate the one - particle hamiltonian by expanding eq . about the crossing point .",
    "let us denote by @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) be a two - component fermi field with wave vectors @xmath24 ( measured from the @xmath14 point ) .",
    "the effective free fermion hamiltonian , in momentum and in position space , is @xmath25 here , and from now on , we have set @xmath26 for simplicity ( and rescaled the energy scale so that @xmath27 ) .",

    "thus for bilayer graphene one has @xmath29 .    for a system of ( spinless ) fermions with a qbc with short - range repulsive microscopic interactions , the effective low - energy hamiltonian is the sum of the free - fermion hamiltonian @xmath30 of eq . and an interaction term @xmath31 which can be succinctly written in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two ( positive ) coupling constants .",
    "the operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 in eq .",
    "are , respectively , given by the ( hermitian ) bilinears of fermion operators , @xmath37 here @xmath38 , and , for clarity , where we have suppressed the spinor indices .",
    "for @xmath26 the full hamiltonian , @xmath39 is invariant under time - reversal and under arbitrary rotations .",
    "however for @xmath40 , it is only invariant under the ( discrete ) point - group @xmath41 .",
    "the operator @xmath35 of eq . breaks time - reversal invariance and is the order parameter for time - reversal symmetry breaking . if @xmath42 the system would have a gap and exhibit a zero - field quantum hall effect with @xmath43 ( i.e. an anomalous quantum hall effect ) .",
    "the operator @xmath36 of eq .",
    "breaks rotational invariance and it is the nematic order parameter . in fact",
    "@xmath44 is invariant under a rotation by @xmath45 and hence it is not a vector but a director , as it should be . moreover , if we were to add terms proportional to the operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 to the free - fermion hamiltonian of eq . , the qbc either gets gapped ( if @xmath48 ) or splits into two massless dirac fermions which are separated either along the @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) axis ( is @xmath51 ) or along a diagonal ( if @xmath52 ) .",
    "hence this state breaks rotational invariance ( or @xmath3 or @xmath53 down to @xmath4 ) .",
    "hence , a state with @xmath54 is a topological chern insulator , while a state with @xmath55 is a nematic semi - metal .",
    "if spin and other degrees of freedom are also considered , other operators ( and hence possible phases ) which transform non - trivially under other symmetries must be considered , leading , for instance , to a state with a spin hall effect , a ferromagnet , triplet nematic order , and others.@xcite    in the case of the theory of a massless dirac fermions ( e.g. , graphene ) short - range interactions are irrelevant operators , rendering the semi metallic phase stable , and can only trigger a ( quantum ) phase transition if the coupling constants are larger than a critical value.@xcite however , in the case of a theory of fermions with a qbc , short - range interactions of the form of eq .",

    "dimensions this means that all four fermion operators are _ marginal _ ( in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense ) since here @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the stability ( or instability ) of the free - fermion qbc semimetal , such as the surface states of the three - dimensional crystalline topological insulators,@xcite such as pb@xmath61sn@xmath62te , is determined by quantum corrections .",

    "incidentally , the main effect of the berry phase term is to make the two components of the nematic order parameter field to be canonically conjugate pairs .",

    "this is consistent with the fact that the dynamical exponent is @xmath1 and the the dimensionality of space is @xmath227 .",
    "hence the  effective dimension is @xmath60 .",
    "hence the quartic term of the lagrangian is superficially marginal at the nematic quantum critical free field point , @xmath228 .",

    "provided this assumption ( which we have not verified ) is correct , we deduce that the quantum critical behavior is that of the effective classical theory , of eq . , with logarithmic corrections to scaling . on the other hand ,",
    "if the quartic term were to be marginally relevant , it would turn this quantum phase transition in to a fluctuation - induced first order transition .",
    "finally this theory has a finite - temperature thermodynamic phase transition at a @xmath230 at which the nematic order is lost .",
    "if the symmetry is @xmath213 then we expect a conventional nematic continuous ( kosterlitz - thouless ) phase transition .",
    "on the other hand if the symmetry is broken ( microscopically ) down to a discrete ising ( @xmath231 ) symmetry , the the finite - temperature transition would be in the 2d ising universality class .",

    "a change in the background metric @xmath235 of the surface on which the electron fluid resides modifies the definition of the momentum of the electrons through their coupling to the metric . a consequence of the breaking of time reversal and parity ( either explicit or spontaneous ) the effective field theory of the weak perturbation of the metric contains a term which is odd under parity and time reversal .",
    "such chern - simons - type terms are first order in time derivatives , and their coefficient is the hall viscosity .    on the other hand , the fermion field of the system we are interested in is a theory of two - component spinors and it is not galilean invariant .",

    "a global change of basis with a rotation axis normal to the plane is a symmetry since it is equivalent to a rotation of the space axis .",

    "fluid , this viscosity tensor is symmetric , indicating the rotation entails an energy cost and , furthermore , in general it is a dissipative response .",
    "however , in a system of spinors with broken parity and time - reversal invariance , such as qah phase of our system , the tensor @xmath288 must have an antisymmetric part which is odd under parity .",
    "thus , when we rotate the spinor frame in the qah phase , there is a torque viscosity @xmath289 , which is not parallel but perpendicular to the direction of the rotation .",
    "this dissipationless rotation response is a unique signature of parity - violating phase of a system with spinors degrees of freedom .    in chern insulators , the spinor and orbital degrees of freedom",
    "are locked to each other . in the case of a dirac ( weyl )",
    "fermion , the spinor polarization is locked with the direction of propagation of the state ( the momentum ) . in our case ,",
    "the spinor polarization is locked instead with quadrupole moment of the momentum of the state . in this way , a rotation in spinor space induces a momentum current and vice versa .",
    "a consequence of these observations is that there must be a relation between the hall viscosity and hall torque viscosity .",
    "to see what the relation is let us compare the stress tensor with the spinor torque .",
    "let us compute the rate of change of the action under an infinitesimal change of the frame fields , parametrized by @xmath290 and @xmath291 respectively ( defined in eq . ) , and compare that with the torque .",
    "we obtain @xmath292 and @xmath293 after some simple algebra , it is easy to check the equivalence between spin rotation torque and the stress tensor , @xmath294 as a result , if we subtract the antisymmetric parts from both the stress tensor correlator and of the torque correlator , we obtain @xmath295 this identity implies the following linear relation between hall viscosity @xmath263 , the hall torque viscosity @xmath289 , and the berry phase @xmath234 coefficient in our effective theory , @xmath296 thus , the berry phase term that was obtained from the effective theory for the nematic order parameter field measures the difference of hall viscosity and hall torque viscosity .",
    "we should note that the expressions for @xmath234 , @xmath263 and @xmath284 given , respectively , in eqs .",
    ", and , obey this relation exactly .",
    "the validity of these results are not restricted to the particular chern insulator we studied here .",
    "the hall torque viscosity is a universal property in all kinds of qah phases . in systems in which the fermions arise from of several orbitals ,",
    "the fermion operator in the effective action is a multi - component spinor .",
    "suppose that the system has a non - vanishing chern number , and hence that it is in a qah state .",
    "if we rotate the spinor frame , the torque viscosity tensor , which is the linear response coefficient between torque and the angular velocity of the spinor rotation , must always include an antisymmetric part resulting from the parity violation in the fermion system .",
    "as an example , let us choose the case of a dirac ( weyl ) fermion .",
    "suppose we rotate the spinor frame in a similar way as in eq ..",
    "after this rotation which , again is not a symmetry transformation , the lagrangian changes to @xmath297 in the case of a dirac ( weyl ) fermion the rotation metric couples both with the current and momentum .",
    "if we integrate - out the fermion , we would also get a hall torque viscosity term @xmath298 for a dirac fermion , the spin is locked with linear momentum . therefore , the equivalence between a spinor rotation and momentum current is expected and , hence , there is a similar relation between hall viscosity and hall torque viscosity .",
    "in this paper we presented a theory of the mott quantum anomalous hall state in the vicinity of its transition to a nematic qah state .",
    "our theory was developed in the context of a theory of spinless fermions which , at the free fermion level has a quadratic band crossing .",
    "a main result of this work is the effective field theory of sections [ sec:1/n ] and [ sec : nematic - effective - action ] in which we derived the effective action for the hydrodynamic gauge fields @xmath83 and @xmath103 ( which represent the charge currents ) and the nematic order parameter field @xmath299 .",
    "the gauge theory sector is dominated by two topological terms , the bf term and the chern - simons term .",
    "the effective action of the nematic fields was found to contain a berry phase term whose parity and time - reversal odd coefficient @xmath234 controls the dynamics .",
    "in particular the effective dynamical exponent of the nematic fields is @xmath1 , consistent with the results of maciejko _ et al _ developed in the context of the fractional quantum hall states.@xcite we also found that the nematic fields couple to the gauge field @xmath83 as a spatial metric .",
    "our results clarify the role of geometric degrees of freedom in systems that exhibit the quantum hall effect .",
    "we expect that these results should also apply to the case of the fractional quantum hall effect and we will discuss these results elsewhere.@xcite    in this work we considered the transition from the qah phase to a nematic qah phase ( which is a continuous transition ) .",
    "it is is also possible to instead consider different regime of coupling constants in which the leading instability from the qbc is to a nematic semi - metal followed by a first order transition to the nematic qah.@xcite however in this case the theory that we presented here does not strictly apply since the transition would now be first order .",
    "nevertheless the structure of our main results will still hold .",
    "a direct instability from the free qbc system to a nematic qah phase does not seem to occur naturally .",
    "in section [ sec : torque - viscosity ] we investigated the relation between the coefficient @xmath234 of the berry phase of the nematic fields and the hall viscosity @xmath263 of the spinors , which measures the transverse response to a local change of the spinor frame .",
    "here we found that the complete picture requires the introduction of the concept of the torque hall viscosity @xmath284 , which is related to the fact that for s system of spinors a deformation of the underlying space requires the introduction of a spin connection .",
    "this effect is associated with the kinematics of spinors .",
    "although it is always present multi - component fermionic systems , it takes a different form for dirac fermions and in this model with a quadratic band crossing ( with unit chern number ) .",
    "in particular we found that these three coefficients obey a universal linear relation given in eq ..",
    "nevertheless these features are generic properties .",
    "our results are of interest in several systems accessible to experiment .",
    "one such system is bilayer graphene , which has two ( almost exact ) quadratic band crossings in the brillouin zone .",
    "they are almost exact in that their quadratic band crossing is not protected by symmetry .",
    "however it is `` protected '' by the chemistry ( and physics ) of the orbitals of carbon which renders their parity - even gaps extremely small ( and negligible in practice ) .",
    "this is a point that has been investigated at length in the literature.@xcite however in the case of bilayer graphene it is necessary to include the spin degrees of freedom ( which we suppressed here ) .",
    "this leads to a more complex ( and interesting ! ) phase diagram@xcite which deserves further exploration .    in the transport experiments of xia _",
    "et al._@xcite on the 2deg in the first landau level a large nematic susceptibility is seen in the longitudinal resistivities at finite temperature with a weak in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the results presented elsewhere in this paper predict a similar behavior for the longitudinal resistivity at finite temperature in the qah - nematic phase .",
    "other systems of great interest for which these results may be relevant are the topological crystalline insulators.@xcite systems of these type have surface states ( protected by mirror symmetry ) which to a good approximation are described ( at the level of the band structure ) by a low - energy hamiltonian with two quadratic band crossings . in materials such as pb@xmath61sn@xmath62se and pb@xmath61sn@xmath62te , these crossings which are expected to occur at the @xmath300 points on the edges of the surface brillouin zone",
    "have been seen in arpes and stm experiments.@xcite however each quadratic crossing is found to be split into a pair of gapless dirac cones . although there are materials - specific symmetry breaking effects that can explain these findings,@xcite it is also possible that the splittings may be driven by correlation effects , as in the case of the nematic semimetal phase discussed in ref .",
    "nevertheless it is possible that these materials ( or a close relative of them ) may also exhibit a spontaneous quantum anomalous hall phase such as the one discussed here ( based on the work of ref . [ ] ) and that the physics that we discussed here in detail may apply there too .",
    "other materials in which these ideas may be relevant are the pyrochlore iridates.@xcite    one of the motivations of this work , as we stated above , was to explore the interplay between the topological sector of these systems and the more microscopic `` geometric '' degrees of freedom .",
    "this issue was raised originally in the context of the experiments of xia _ et al . _ in fractional quantum hall states in the first landau level of the 2deg@xcite and has motivated several important theoretical developments.@xcite much of that work ( see , e.g. ref . [ ] ) has focused on the role of geometric changes at the microscopic level ( i.e. at the length scale of the magnetic length ) . however , as we showed in this paper these `` geometric '' degrees of freedom can be self - organized into nematic order parameter fields whose fluctuations may manifest at even long length scales and hence may trigger a quantum phase transition of a nematic topological phase . in a separate publication@xcite",

    "<S> band crossing and short range four - fermion marginally relevant interactions we use a @xmath0 expansion and bosonization methods to derive the effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with the conserved currents and with the local fluctuations of the nematic order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the vicinity of the quantum phase transition from the isotropic mott chern insulating phase to a phase in which time - reversal symmetry breaking coexists with nematic order , the nematic chern insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the topological sector of the effective field theory is a bf / chern - simons gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the nematic order parameter field couples with the maxwell - type terms of the gauge fields as the space components of a locally fluctuating metric tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the nematic field has @xmath1 dynamic scaling exponent . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy dynamics of the nematic order parameter is found to be governed by a berry phase term . by means of a detailed analysis of the coupling of the spinor field of the fermions to the changes of their local frames originating from long - wavelength lattice deformations </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the hall viscosity of this system and show that in this system it is not the same as the berry phase term in the effective action of the nematic field , but both are related to the concept of torque hall viscosity which we introduce here . </S>"
