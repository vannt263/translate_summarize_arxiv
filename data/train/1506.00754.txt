    ". a cursory look at graphenes properties would provide reasons for this .",
    "graphene is light with huge tensile strength and crucially in contrast to most materials , electronic energy is linearly proportional to its wave vector and not its square and it shows quite remarkable quantum phenomena like klein tunneling@xcite and room temperature quantum hall effect@xcite , etc .",
    "notwithstanding the many advantages of using graphene to transport electrons faster and with less dissipation it has been observed that spin orbit effect in graphene is at best negligible thus making them of no practical use for applications in spintronics .",
    "then how do we exploit the manifest advantages of graphene and marry them to spintronics . in this communication",
    "we address this issue .",
    "we intend to embed a monolayer of graphene with a single molecule magnet .",
    "we then adiabatically modulate two independent parameters of the resulting system to pump a pure spin current .",
    "the two parameters we modulate are one- the magnetization strength of the magnetic molecule which has been shown to be controlled by twisting it@xcite .",
    "secondly , we add a delta function like point interaction , which can either be an isolated adatom in the graphene monolayer or an extended line defect or even a very thin potential barrier with the strength of the potential barrier being controlled by a gate voltage . using these two parameters",

    ", height=283 ]    adiabatic quantum pumping is a means of transferring charge and/or spin carriers without applying any external perturbation ( like voltage bias , etc . ) by the cyclic variation of two independent system parameters .",
    "the theory of adiabatic quantum pumping was developed in 1998@xcite based on the fact that adiabatic modulations to a 2deg can lead to changes in local density of states and thus current transport . in 1999 ,",
    "an adiabatic quantum electron pump was reported in an open quantum dot where the pumping signal was produced in response to the cyclic deformation of the confining potential@xcite .",
    "the variation of the dot s shape changes electronic quasi energy states of the dot thus ` pumping ' electrons from one reservoir to another .",
    "the ac voltages applied to the quantum dot in order to change the shape result in a dc current when the reservoirs are in equilibrium .",
    "this non - zero current is only produced if there are at least two time varying parameters in the system as a single parameter quantum pump does not transfer any charge . later on the study of adiabatic pumping phenomenon has been extended to adiabatic spin pumping both in experiment as well as theory@xcite . in the experiment on quantum spin",
    "pumping one generates a pure spin current via a quantum dot by applying an in plane magnetic field which is adiabatically modulated to facilitate a net transfer of spin .",
    "many spintronic devices , such as the spin valve and magnetic tunneling junctions@xcite , are associated with the flow of spin polarized charge currents .",
    "spin polarized currents coexist with charge currents and are generated when an imbalance between spin up and spin down carriers is created , for example , by using magnetic materials or applying a strong magnetic field or by exploiting spin - orbit coupling in semiconductors@xcite . the spin transport aided by bias voltage",
    "have been studied earlier@xcite .",
    "more recently , there has been an increasing interest in the generation of pure spin current by quantum pumping without an accompanying charge current@xcite . in monolayer graphene",
    ", a group has attempted to address this issue by proposing a device , consisting of ferromagnetic strips and gate electrodes@xcite",
    ". however , ferromagnetic strips in graphene are unwieldy and lead to further complication as spin polarization is lost at the feromagnet - graphene interface . in this work",
    "we look at only a piece of monolayer graphene without any ferromagnets but with two impurities one magnetic(smm ) the other non - magnetic . independently modulating these two we show generation of pure spin currents .",
    "the generation of a pure spin - current is only possible if all spin - up electrons flow in one direction and equal amount of spin - down electrons flow in the opposite direction . in this case",
    "the net charge current @xmath1 vanishes while a finite spin current @xmath2 exists , because @xmath3 , where @xmath4 or @xmath5 are the electron current with spin - up or spin - down .",
    "further we also see generation of spin selective currents namely either only @xmath4 or @xmath5 and this implies the total magnitude of charge current is identical to that of the spin current .    in this work",
    "we show how pure spin currents and spin selective currents can be generated via twisting a single molecule magnet .",
    "single molecule magnets are of great importance for molecular spintronics .",
    "such molecules can now be synthesized , for example the molecule @xmath6ac , which has a ground state with a large spin ( s=10 ) , and a very slow relaxation of magnetization at low temperature@xcite .",
    "smm s do not just have integer spin values a number of smm s like mn4o3 complex@xcite have large half integer spin s = 9/2 .",
    "however , in a literal twist to this tale ( pun intended ) , a few years back scientists revealed that these big spin molecules can be twisted and thus their magnetization can be easily altered @xcite .",
    "this fact we utilize in our adiabatic pumping mechanism .",
    "the mechanism of twisting is not difficult to implement .",
    "smm s have a metallic core ( for example in @xmath6 complexes the metallic core consists of the @xmath7 moiety ) and a deliberate targeted structural distortion of it leads to change in the magnetization of the smm so much so that a initially ferromagnetic smm can undergo a twist to a anti - ferromagnetic smm .",
    "the twist can be effectively controlled by two methods-(i ) a simple substitution of one type of atom ( in @xmath6 complexes a h atom ) by another sterically demanding atom ( again in @xmath6 complexes by a me , et , ph , etc .",
    "atom ) or by ( ii ) the other way this can be achieved is through the use of hydrostatic pressure@xcite . in this method external hydrostatic pressure",
    "is applied on the smm leading to a twisting of the metallic core and thus a net change in magnetization . while the substitution method leads to a discrete change in the magnetization the pressure method leads to a continuous change .",
    "therefore , the pressure method is much more amenable to the quantum pumping mechanism wherein the pressure applied could be continuously changed albeit adiabatically leading to a adiabatic change in magnetization and thus the exchange interaction @xmath8 .",
    "graphene is a monatomic layer of graphite with a honeycomb lattice structure  @xcite that can be split into two triangular sublattices @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the electronic properties of graphene are effectively described by the massless dirac equation .",
    "the presence of isolated fermi points , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in its spectrum , gives rise to two distinctive valleys .",

    "@xmath16 is an uniaxial anisotropy constant and @xmath17 is the z component of the spin of the molecular magnet .",
    "the second term is most relevant to us since we deal with electron transport .",
    "the dirac electrons in graphene interact with smm only via the exchange term @xmath18 .",
    "further the magnitude in realistic smm of @xmath16 is very small as compared to @xmath8 , @xmath19 mev while @xmath20 mev almost a thousand times larger@xcite .",
    "though anisotropy is very important term in preserving the intrinsic properties of smm , it s effect on conduction electron is hardly a small correction to energy , nothing else .",
    "the first term will only be relevant in electronic structure calculations for electronic transport calculations it is not relevant and the only term of interest in the exchange coupling .",
    "thus we only consider the second term in the subsequent analysis . we consider a single molecule magnet at @xmath21 and another electrostatic delta potential at @xmath0 nm . the hamiltonian of a dirac electron moving along x - direction can be written as @xmath22 the first term represent the kinetic energy term for graphene with @xmath23 the paulli matrices that operate on the sub - lattices @xmath9 or @xmath10 and @xmath24 the 2d momentum vector , second term is electron interacting with single molecule magnet and third term",

    "finally , in figure 5 we plot the pumped currents as function of the phase difference between modulated parameters .",
    "we see that pumped current attains maximum at @xmath185 and minima around @xmath186 .",
    "the pure spin current is maintained throughout the whole range of @xmath187 .",
    "the temperature effect is shown in the same figure , which shows a small damping in amplitudes of the individual spin currents .",
    "one can see that temperature has no noticeable effect on the pure spin currents apart from a slight diminishing of the magnitude . to conclude this section , pure spin currents in graphene are immune to any temperature increase apart from decrease in magnitude while disorder has a small effect as it shift the parameter regime for occurrence of pure spin currents although it can not kill it off .",
    "a major issue which was flagged right from the early days of quantum pumping was whether the switkes experiment@xcite was a real demonstration of quantum pumping , since the pumped current was observed to be symmetric with respect to magnetic field reversal just like the two terminal conductance@xcite . however since pumped currents are functions of scattering amplitudes and not scattering probabilities they should have no particular symmetry with respect to magnetic field reversal unless the system itself had some particular symmetry@xcite . as the switkes expt .",
    "system did not possess any particular symmetry it was quickly recognized that the current attributed as a a pumping current was in effect a rectified current which depend on the conductance of the system@xcite .",
    "however there could have been a pumped current which was masked by the rectified currents .",
    "the origin of rectified currents is because experimentally at the nanoscale it is difficult to control time varying parameters .",
    "most naturally time varying parameters couple to input and output leads and instead of only pumping a current there is in addition a transport current defined the net conductance through the system .",
    "so any quantum pumping at the nanoscale will have rectified currents and therefore it become imperative to have a scheme to differentiate these currents .",
    "the rectified spin up current is defined as : @xmath188 , @xmath189 s are the modulated parameters . in the weak pumping regime",
    "we have- @xmath190 , with @xmath191 .    in fig .",
    "[ rect ] we can see clearly that the conductance ( both spin - up as well as spin - down ) are symmetric with respect to small values of j. thus unlike pumped currents whose direction can be changed by changing the magnetization from positive to negative , the conductance on the other hand shows no such effect .",
    "the pumped currents are completely asymmetric as function of j as seen in fig .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) .",
    "thus even if rectified currents will be present in the system the pumped spin current will be distinguished because of their asymmetric nature with respect to magnetization reversal .",
    "the experimental realization of our pure spin current pumping device should nt be too difficult .",
    "as already outlined in the last paragraph of the introduction of this paper adiabatically modulating the pressure applied on the single molecule magnet would entail a corresponding adiabatically modulated magnetization of smm .",
    "the second adiabatically modulated parameter of the device is an adatom placed `` a '' distance apart from smm .",
    "the adatom is modeled as a delta function like point interaction similarly embedded in graphene .",
    "a gate voltage applied to the adatom can change the potential felt by electrons scattered from it .",
    "when the gate voltage itself is adiabatically modulated in time we have all the ingredients for the quantum pumping of pure spin currents and spin selective currents .",
    "alternatively , an extended line defect can be created instead of adatom , which can be controlled experimentally@xcite .",
    "moreover , one can also use a thin potential barrier experimentally which can be theoretically modeled as a delta like potential .",
    "similarly , the single molecule magnet is infact a large molecule with host of atoms ranging from 30 - 100 atoms , these atoms are arranged not only having vertical but also horizontal extension i.e. , a single molecule magnet will have sufficient extension along transverse direction .",
    "mention may be made of ref .",
    "on single molecule magnets which exemplifies the situation envisaged .    to conclude we have shown that notwithstanding the fact that spin transport via spin orbit effect is almost impossible to be observed in graphene , we have in a novel manner pumped pure spin currents and spin selective currents in graphene via embedding it with a single molecule magnet .",
    "the study of pure spin currents in graphene via embedded smm will be extended to spin correlations and whether one can generate entangled spin currents which will have potential impact on quantum information processing@xcite in a subsequent work .",
