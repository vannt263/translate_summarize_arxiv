    "morse theory analyzes the topology of a manifold @xmath6 by looking at smooth functions @xmath7 whose critical points are non - degenerate .",
    "it was introduced by marston morse in the twenties @xcite ; it was developed in the second half of the @xmath8 century by bott , thom , milnor , smale , witten , goresky and macpherson ( among others ) ; it was used by smale and freedman to prove the poincar conjecture in all dimensions higher than three .",
    "steven smale called morse theory `` the most significant single contribution to mathematics by an american mathematician '' @xcite .",
    "many functions are morse ; in fact , any smooth function can be approximated by a morse function .",
    "bott weakened morse s original definition in order to allow also functions whose critical cells form submanifolds rather than isolated points ( e.g. constant functions ) ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "any morse function provides information on the homology of a manifold .",
    "for example , the number of critical points of index @xmath9 is not less than the @xmath9-th betti numbers of the manifold .",
    "these bounds are usually not sharp , but in some cases they can be made sharp using smale s cancellation theorem : see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite or @xcite . in one case",
    "morse theory even reveals the homeomorphism type : reeb showed that if a morse function on a smooth manifold without boundary has only two critical points , then the manifold is a @xmath2-sphere .",
    "the reeb theorem is a crucial ingredient in milnor s proof of the existence of `` exotic spheres '' @xcite and in smale s proof of the generalized poincar conjecture @xcite .",
    "the idea of duality is at the core of morse theory .",
    "if @xmath10 is a smooth morse function on a topological manifold without boundary @xmath6 , so is @xmath11 .",
    "the critical points of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the same , except that they have complementary index .",
    "this way poincar duality ( `` the @xmath9-th and the @xmath12-th betti number of any manifold without boundary coincide '' ) can be seen as a corollary of morse theory . moving downwards along some gradient flow line of @xmath10",
    "is the same as moving upwards along some gradient flow line of @xmath11 .    in the nineties forman introduced a discretized version of morse theory , in which topological manifolds are replaced by regular cw complexes and smooth functions",
    "are replaced by special poset maps between the face poset of the complex and @xmath13 .",
    "` critical points ' are just cells at which such maps are strictly increasing @xcite . moving downwards along some gradient flow line is rendered in the discrete setting by an acyclic matching of the face poset ( see figure [ fig : discretemorsefunctions ] ) .",
    "the work of shareshian @xcite yields a partial discrete analogue to bott s relative morse theory : given a discrete morse function on a simplicial complex , the subcomplexes consisting only of critical cells can be `` divided out '' @xcite .    via discrete morse functions we can bound the homology of any regular cw complex @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-th betti number of the complex never exceeds the number of critical @xmath9-cells .",
    "as in reeb s theorem , in one lucky case we can even tell the homeomorphism type of the complex : triangulated @xmath2-manifolds without boundary that admit a discrete morse function with only two critical cells are , in fact , triangulated spheres .",
    "this was first proven by forman in @xcite ; an alternative proof is given in  * theorem  [ thm : spheretheorem]*.    discrete morse theory opens doors to computational geometry @xcite and to commutative algebra @xcite . at the same time , it builds on a classical notion in combinatorial topology , the notion of _ collapse _ introduced by j.h.c .",
    "whitehead in the thirties @xcite .",
    "a complex @xmath14 is _ collapsible _ if it admits a discrete morse function with only one critical cell .",
    "all collapsible complexes are contractible , but the converse does not hold , as shown by zeeman s dunce hat @xcite .",
    "all @xmath15-balls are collapsible , but for each @xmath0 some pl @xmath2-balls are not collapsible .",
    "however , whitehead proved that every collapsible pl @xmath2-manifold is a ball @xcite .",
    "pl stands here for `` piecewise - linear '' ; essentially , it means that the link of any face is either a ball or a sphere . whether the pl assumption is necessary or not in whitehead s result still represents an open problem .",
    "however , the collapsibility assumption is necessary : newman @xcite and mazur @xcite showed that the boundary of a contractible pl manifold is a homology sphere that need not be simply connected .    within the pl framework , discrete morse functions dualize .",
    "with any triangulation of @xmath6 we can associate a `` dual complex '' @xmath16 , a cell complex with the same underlying space as @xmath6 . a discrete morse function @xmath10 on a pl manifold without boundary @xmath6 yields a discrete morse function @xmath11 on the dual block decomposition  @xmath16 ; the critical cells of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are dual to one another @xcite .",
    "so far so good . however , there is some bad news .",
    "an extremely common operation in combinatorial topology is to `` patch '' together two @xmath5-balls by identifying a boundary disk of the first one with a boundary disk of the second one .",
    "the resulting complex is still a @xmath5-ball .",
    "more generally , for any positive integer @xmath2 one can `` patch '' together two @xmath2-balls alongside a @xmath4-ball in their boundary , cf .",
    "unfortunately , discrete morse theory does not relate well to this topological operation .",
    "for example , if we patch together two collapsible @xmath5-balls , do we get a collapsible @xmath5-ball ?",
    "as far as we know , this problem is open . the `` obvious '' approach , namely , to collapse the union @xmath17 by collapsing first @xmath18 and then @xmath19 , may fail .",
    "( a collapse of @xmath18 may start by removing a facet of @xmath20 ; such a collapse is disallowed by the gluing . ) in particular , we do not know whether all constructible balls are collapsible or not .",
    "another problem is the lack of control over the homotopy type of the boundary .",
    "for example : is the boundary of a collapsible manifold always a sphere ?",
    "the answer is not known .",
    "we know that the boundary of any collapsible ( or contractible ) manifold has the same homology of a sphere .",
    "also , whitehead showed that the boundary of a pl collapsible manifold is a sphere @xcite .",
    "however , not all collapsible manifolds are pl : for a @xmath21-dimensional example , take the cone over a non - pl @xmath22-ball .    in the present paper ,",
    "we bypass these difficulties using duality .",
    "we present a version of duality for manifolds with boundary ( * theorem  [ thm : relativeduality ] * ) .",
    "let us explain the idea in the luckiest scenario , namely , when the critical cells are as few as possible .",
    "we call a manifold without boundary `` _ _ endo - collapsible _ _ '' if it admits a discrete morse function with two critical cells .",
    "we call a manifold with boundary `` _ _ endo - collapsible _ _ '' if it admits a discrete morse function whose critical cells are all the boundary cells , plus a single interior cell .",
    "( see section  [ sec : background ] for details . )",
    "it turns out that the notion of endo - collapsibility is _ selfdual _ for manifolds without boundary , and essentially _ dual to collapsibility _ for manifolds with boundary .",
    "in fact :    a pl manifold without boundary @xmath6 is endo - collapsible if and only if @xmath16 is @xcite .    if @xmath6 is a pl endo - collapsible manifold with boundary , then @xmath16 is pl collapsible .",
    "( the converse is false , cf .",
    "corollary  [ cor : strictlyc - ec ] . )    if @xmath6 is pl collapsible , then @xmath16 is pl endo - collapsible ( corollary   [ cor : dualityec - c ] ) .",
    "now , the collapsibility notion can be extended to regular cw complexes , and even further  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , endo - collapsibility requires the presence of a boundary , so we may define it only for pseudo - manifolds .",
    "so why bother in studying endo - collapsibility rather than collapsibility ?",
    "we found four concrete reasons .",
    "endo - collapsibility determines the topology of a manifold . by using a result of simple - connectedness ( lemma  [ lem : simplyconnected ] ) and the poincar conjecture",
    ", we can prove the following statement .",
    "[ theorem [ thm : firstball ] ] [ mainthm : a1 ] all endo - collapsible manifolds with boundary are balls .",
    "so the dual approach pays off : whitehead s approach can show that collapsible manifolds with boundary are balls , but only after adding the pl assumption .",
    "endo - collapsibility behaves very well under patching .",
    "the union of endo - collapsible balls that intersect in a codimension - one endo - collapsible ball is again endo - collapsible .",
    "more generally , discrete morse functions for which the whole boundary is made of critical cells `` naturally add up '' ( see * theorem [ thm : depthunion ] * ) .",
    "reflecting on the structure of the barycentric subdivision , we reach the following result .",
    "[ theorems [ thm : constructibleendo ] and [ thm : sdcollapsible ] ] [ mainthm : a2 ] all constructible manifolds with boundary are endo - collapsible",
    ". their barycentric subdivisions are collapsible .    the final claim of main theorem  [ mainthm : a2 ] `` almost '' answers the open problem of whether all constructible @xmath2-balls are collapsible .",
    "( now we know that a possible counterexample , if there is any , must be in the class of non - collapsible balls with collapsible subdivision . )",
    "also : when paired with main theorem  [ mainthm : a1 ] , main theorem  [ mainthm : a2 ] strengthens a classical result by zeeman ( `` _ _ all constructible manifolds with boundary are balls _ _ '' ) . both zeeman s result and the first part of main theorem [ mainthm : a2 ] ( but not main theorem [ mainthm : a1 ] )",
    "generalize to pseudo - manifolds with boundary .    for @xmath5-balls ,",
    "endo - collapsibility is an intermediate property between constructibility and collapsibility ( cf .",
    "[ cor : strictlyc - ec ] ) .",
    "now , many @xmath5-balls contain an interior edge ( called `` knotted spanning '' ) that together with some boundary path forms a knot .",
    "if the knot is the sum of @xmath23 trefoils , then the @xmath24-th barycentric subdivision of the @xmath5-ball is _ not collapsible_. this surprising obstruction , discovered in the sixties by bing @xcite , is sharp for all @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if the knot is the sum of @xmath25 trefoils , then the @xmath24-th barycentric subdivision of the @xmath5-ball is _ not constructible _ @xcite .",
    "( for @xmath26 this bound is `` off by one ''",
    "@xcite[lemma  1 ] ; we do not know whether it is sharp for some @xmath24 . ) is there an analogous theorem for endo - collapsibility , with an intermediate bound between @xmath25 and @xmath23 ?",
    "the answer is positive :    [ corollary  [ cor : endonoknot1 ] ] [ mainthm : a4 ] if the knot is the sum of @xmath27 trefoils , the @xmath24-th barycentric subdivision of a @xmath5-ball with a knotted spanning edge is _ not endo - collapsible_.    this bound is sharp for @xmath26 ( corollary  [ cor : sharp ] ) .",
    "therefore , it traces a concrete line of distinction between constructible , endo - collapsible and collapsible @xmath5-balls .",
    "the barycentric subdivision of a collapsible @xmath5-ball is always endo - collapsible ( * prop .  [ prop : subdividec - ec ] * ) , but not always constructible ( * rem .  [ rem : subdividec - nonc ] * ) .",
    "taking cones trivially induces collapsibility , as the cone over _ any _ complex is collapsible . in contrast , taking cones preserves endo - collapsibility without inducing it :    [ theorem  [ thm : coneendo2 ] ] [ mainthm : a3 ] the cone over a manifold @xmath6 is endo - collapsible if and only if @xmath6 is endo - collapsible .",
    "this leads to plenty of examples of balls that are collapsible without being endo - collapsible .",
    "if we focus on discrete morse function for which all boundary cells are critical , studying @xmath6 or @xmath28 is the same .",
    "( see theorem  [ thm : coneendo2 ] . )",
    "endo - collapsible @xmath2-balls are characterized by the fact that they collapse onto their boundary ( which is a sphere ) minus a facet . however , if @xmath29 this complex need not be collapsible .",
    "in fact , a `` badly triangulated '' sphere can still be the boundary of a `` nicely triangulated '' ball .",
    "( see remark  [ rem : pachner ] . )",
    "are there endo - collapsible @xmath2-balls that are not collapsible ?",
    "we do not have any examples at the moment .",
    "we have however the following _ two _ hierarchies :    [ theorem [ thm : endo - hierarchy ] ] [ mainthm : b ] for @xmath2-manifolds ( @xmath30 ) , _ @xmath31 _ and for @xmath0 all of these implications are strict .    the local constructibility notion mentioned above was introduced in connection with discrete quantum gravity in @xcite and later linked to combinatorial topology in @xcite . for any fixed @xmath30",
    ", arbitrary simplicial @xmath2-manifolds are much more than exponentially many , when counted with respect to the number of facets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  2 ) . however , there are only exponentially many different combinatorial types of locally constructible simplicial @xmath2-manifolds @xcite .",
    "thus we essentially control the number of endo - collapsible manifolds .",
    "a knotted triangulation of the @xmath5-sphere can not be locally constructible , if the knot is complicated enough @xcite . in section [ sec : lc ]",
    ", we extend this result to manifolds with arbitrary discrete morse functions , thus answering a question of chari @xcite .",
    "[ theorem  [ thm : obstruction ] ] [ mainthm : c ] for each integer @xmath0 and for each @xmath32 , there is a pl @xmath2-sphere on which _ any _ discrete morse function has more than @xmath33 critical @xmath4-cells",
    ".    the same can be said of @xmath2-balls , if we replace `` critical @xmath4-cells '' by `` critical interior @xmath4-cells '' and we restrict the conclusion to _ boundary - critical _ morse functions , that is , functions for which all boundary cells are critical .",
    "we also provide the first known exponential bound for the total number of manifolds with a given boundary - critical discrete morse function :    [ theorem [ thm : enumeration ] ] [ mainthm : d ] let @xmath33 and @xmath2 be nonnegative integers . counting with respect to the number of facets ,",
    "there are ( at most ) _ exponentially many _ combinatorial types of simplicial @xmath2-manifolds that admit a boundary - critical morse function @xmath10 with at most @xmath33 interior critical @xmath4-cells .",
    "an exponential lower bound can be produced easily .",
    "in fact , the @xmath2-spheres that are combinatorially equivalent to the boundary of some stacked @xmath34-polytope are already exponentially many ( * ? ? ? * cor .",
    "the boundary of any polytope admits a discrete morse function without critical @xmath4-cells , cf .",
    "example  [ ex : polytope ] .",
    "in conclusion , relative discrete morse theory yields a nice exponential cutoff for the class of all triangulated @xmath2-manifolds , much like `` bounding the genus '' yields a nice exponential cutoff for the class of triangulated surfaces @xcite @xcite .",
    "so , when the number of facets is sufficiently large , @xmath2-manifolds on which every discrete morse function has a high number of critical ( interior ) @xmath4-cells are the rule rather than the exception .",
