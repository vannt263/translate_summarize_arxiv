    "in this paper we will focus on the nonlinear dynamics of one - dimensional ( 1d ) partial differential equations ( pdes ) , having the form  @xcite @xmath8 , \\label{nle}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a general nonlinear operator , not depending explicitly on time @xmath10 and space @xmath11 and whose trivial solution @xmath12 has a linear stability spectrum whose modes of sufficiently small wave vector are unstable .",
    "more precisely , setting @xmath13 , and keeping only terms that are linear in @xmath14 , one obtains a dispersion relation relating @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "two well - known dispersion relations  @xcite are ,    @xmath17 & \\omega ( q ) = q^2 - q^4   & &   \\mbox{conserved models}. & \\label{w_con}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq_omega ]    in both cases @xmath18 for @xmath19 . in other words ,",
    "the trivial solution @xmath20 is unstable for @xmath19 .",
    "this means that modes with arbitrary small wave numbers are unstable , and therefore , in principle , spatial structures with large wavelength can develop , so that the notion of coarsening makes sense .",
    "this implies that we exclude situations where there is a small @xmath16 cut - off , that is , when there is a minimal wave number below which the trivial solution is stable .",
    "a typical example in this category is the swift - hohenberg equation @xcite , for which the dispersion relation takes the form @xmath21 , with @xmath22 a real parameter .",
    "this dispersion relation means that if @xmath23 , then there is a minimal wave vector @xmath24 below which the trivial solution is stable .",
    "we do not expect in this case a structure with a wave number smaller than @xmath25 to take place ( no perpetual coarsening is _ a priori _ expected ) .",
    "while this statement complies with intuition , we must keep in mind that the stability evoked above follows from a linear analysis .",
    "therefore , since the equations of interest are nonlinear , exceptions are not excluded  @xcite . having in mind the occurrence of some exceptions",
    ", we will focus on systems having a linear dispersion relation of the form ( [ eq_omega ] ) .",
    "this holds for many nonlinear pdes .",
    "the most well - known equations are the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) , the cahn - hilliard ( ch ) , the kuramoto - sivashinsky ( ks ) , and their variants or generalizations  @xcite .",
    "equations of this class will be introduced and discussed in the next section .",
    "note that having unstable modes for small @xmath16 as in ( [ eq_omega ] ) is not a sufficient condition .",
    "a prominent example is the ks equation , which shows spatiotemporal chaos , with wavelengths of constant average size being continuously destroyed and created .",
    "this is not surprising : the analysis of the linear stability spectrum does not univocally determines the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "one important feature that we will discuss here is the determination of the branch of periodic steady - state solutions , which acquire a special status in our investigation of coarsening dynamics .",
    "this is _ a priori _ not obvious , since coarsening is a time - dependent process , but it has been shown before that stationary configurations of period @xmath4 , @xmath26 , play a major role in determining the type of nonlinear dynamics : for a certain class of nonlinear equations in one dimension , two of us have proven  @xcite that coarsening is possible if and only if the wavelength @xmath4 is an increasing function of the amplitude @xmath27 of the solution @xmath5 , @xmath28 .",
    "the presence of a maximum in the curve @xmath29 signals the phenomenon of interrupted coarsening , while a decreasing @xmath30 signals no coarsening at all .",
    "finally , for some equations such as ks , @xmath29 is not a single - value function and the curve displays a so - called turning point .",
    "all these examples show that steady states contain important pieces of information .",
    "however , how is it possible that dynamics depends on stationary properties only ?",
    "the answer to this question is contained in the concept of phase instability .",
    "for example , in one dimension , a steady - state periodic solution @xmath5 has a wavelength ( or wave number @xmath31 ) @xmath4 such that @xmath32 . in this case",
    "the phase @xmath33 of the pattern is @xmath34 .",
    "however , a perturbation of the wavelength of the pattern ( or equivalently a perturbation of the phase @xmath33 ) may reveal instability ( called phase instability ) , meaning that the wavelength will evolve in time , and if this is the case for any @xmath16 , one may expect coarsening .",
    "a global shift of a periodic pattern in the @xmath11 direction by a constant value @xmath35 is a also a solution , i.e. , @xmath36 , owing to translational invariance ( also called a goldstone mode ) .",
    "this constant shift corresponds to a phase perturbation of infinite wavelength , and since it is a stationary solution , it has an infinite relaxation time towards the original solution @xmath5 . in other words , a large wavelength perturbation of the pattern",
    "is expected to have a large time scale .",
    "this entails that the most dangerous perturbations are those of long wavelengths of the phase of the pattern . to make this notion explicit , we introduce a small parameter @xmath37 expressing the fact that the phase modes of interest have a small spatial gradient , on the scale of the wavelength of the pattern .",
    "an appropriate way to deal with this question is to introduce a multiscale analysis : the fast spatial scale @xmath11 ( where the periodic profile of pattern varies on a scale of order unity ) and a slow scale @xmath38 ( expressing the long wavelength perturbation of the phase of the pattern ) .",
    "the slow spatial scale , implies also a slow time scale ( which can also be inferred from the above discussion about large relaxation times ) @xmath39 .",
    "it turns out that ( see later ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath33 designates the actual phase of a pattern ( not necessarily a periodic one , but some perturbed pattern ) , it will depend on space and time , e.g. , because @xmath5 is perturbed , and acquires a slow spatial and time dependence ( i.e. , it depends on @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , which can be described by a phase diffusion equation ( see next section ) , having the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 are suitably rescaled versions of @xmath44 , and the phase diffusion coefficient @xmath45 only depends on properties of the steady - state solution of wavelength @xmath46 .",
    "a negative @xmath45 signals a phase instability , i.e. , coarsening . other scenarios are possible  @xcite .",
    "even if for several nonlinear equations it is feasible to obtain the analytical form of @xmath45 in the limit of large @xmath4 , in the generic case it is not possible and we must determine it numerically , by computing the steady - state solution @xmath5 , from which we can state if the pattern is stable ( no coarsening ) , or unstable ( coarsening ) .",
    "we will then show how the coarsening exponent ( in the temporal power law ) can be extracted from these considerations ( i.e. without any time integration of the equations ) .    in this paper",
    "we start by briefly describing the multiscale method and apply it to several 1d pdes , therefore extracting the quantities we need to determine @xmath45 numerically .",
    "we will see that we need two functions : ( i )  @xmath5 , the stationary solution , which satisfies the equation @xmath47=0 $ ] , see eq .",
    "( [ nle ] ) , and ( ii )  @xmath48 , solution of the equation @xmath49=0 $ ] , where @xmath50 is the frecht derivative of @xmath9 and @xmath51 is its adjoint operator .",
    "we will show how it is possible to implement the numerical determination of such functions , therefore the determination of @xmath45 and , finally , how we can get the coarsening exponent @xmath1 , describing the time dependence of the typical scale , @xmath52 , when coarsening is present .",
    "particular attention will be devoted to the conserved kuramoto - sivashinsky ( cks ) equation , because in such a case @xmath50 is not self - adjoint and special care must be devoted to the determination of @xmath48 .",
    "in this section we introduce all nonlinear equations we are going to discuss , we give a very brief sketch of the multiscale approach used to extract the phase diffusion equation , and we finally provide the expression of the phase diffusion coefficient @xmath6 . in some cases , we just report existing results , but in the case of the cks equation , we provide the original derivation of @xmath6 , which will be seen to deserve special attention .",
    "let us start by listing all equations of interest , the nonconserved first :    [ eq_nc ] @xmath53 \\label{nonc_alpha_eq } & \\partial_t u = \\dfrac{u}{\\left(1 + u^2 \\right)^\\alpha }   + \\partial_x^2 u , & & \\mbox{$\\alpha$ models}.&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then their conservative counterparts :    [ eq_con ] @xmath54 & & \\mbox{ch equation , } & \\\\[5pt ] \\label{c_alpha_eq } & \\hskip -10pt\\partial_t u = -\\partial_x^2\\left [ \\dfrac{u}{\\left(1 + u^2 \\right)^\\alpha }   + \\partial_x^2 u\\right ] & & \\mbox{c$\\alpha$ models}.&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and , finally , the conserved kuramoto - sivashinsky equation @xmath55 & & \\hskip -10pt\\mbox{cks~equation}. & \\partial_t u = -\\partial^2_x [ u - \\tau \\partial_x u + \\partial_x^2 u -\\left ( \\partial_x u\\right)^2 ] \\quad    \\mbox{cks~equation}.\\ ] ] gl and ch are classical equations  @xcite describing , e.g. , phase separation processes for a scalar order parameter , either conserved ( ch ) or nonconserved ( gl ) .",
    "the c@xmath22 model for @xmath56 first appeared in problems of crystal growth  @xcite and starting from that specific conserved model it has been natural to extend it  @xcite to @xmath57 and to the nonconserved case .",
    "finally , the cks equation appeared in the study of sand - ripple dynamics  @xcite , then in step - bunching phenomena  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath58 it also appears in the study of wandering crystalline steps  @xcite .",
    "equations  ( [ eq_nc ] ) have the general form @xmath59 and their linear dispersion relation has the form ( [ w_nc ] ) .",
    "all conservative equations , ( [ eq_con ] ) and ( [ cks_eq ] ) , have the form @xmath60 and their linear dispersion relation is like ( [ w_con ] ) . for eq .",
    "( [ cks_eq ] ) , that is true for @xmath58 only .",
    "however , the @xmath61 term can be canceled out with a tilt transformation : @xmath62 .",
    "we keep it here for sake of generality .    all previous models , conserved and nonconserved , display perpetual coarsening , because , as analyzed in the next subsection , they have a branch @xmath5 of steady states whose @xmath29 characteristic is an increasing , diverging function .      we are now going to discuss the multiscale method , with a focus on the cks eq .",
    "this step has two motivations .",
    "first , the cks equation is a completely non trivial equation , whose nonlinear dynamics has been studied only through direct numerical simulations or through a simplified particle model .",
    "we are not aware of analytical nonlinear studies .",
    "second , its treatment with the multiscale approach is representative of the method , when the frecht derivative is not self - adjoint .",
    "the basic idea is to perturb a periodic steady state @xmath63 .",
    "first , we rescale @xmath11 by introducing the phase @xmath34 , with @xmath31 , so that @xmath64",
    ". next , we introduce slow space and time variables , @xmath65 and perturb @xmath66 so that @xmath16 is now dependent on @xmath38 and @xmath39 . while @xmath11 is the fast space variable , no fast time variable exists , since the base state @xmath5 is a stationary state .",
    "the final step is to perform a multiple scale expansion method  @xcite . identifying the slow phase @xmath67",
