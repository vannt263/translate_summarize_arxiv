    "the total reaction cross section @xmath2  is a basic quantity for the prediction of reaction cross sections in the statistical model .",
    "it has been found that especially at low energies huge discrepancies are found between predictions for @xmath1-induced reaction cross sections using different global @xmath1-nucleus optical potentials .",
    "this holds in particular for ( @xmath1,@xmath4 )  capture reactions for targets with masses above @xmath5 @xcite , but also the energy dependence of recent ( @xmath1,n )  data for @xmath6pr  was difficult to fit @xcite .",
    "the total reaction cross section @xmath2  is related to the complex scattering matrix @xmath7 by the well - known relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the wave number , @xmath10 is the energy in the center - of - mass ( c.m . )  system , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the real reflexion coefficients and scattering phase shifts .",

    "in addition , elastic scattering data for natural cerium ( @xmath0ce : 88.48% ) are available in literature .",
    "these data have also been analyzed , and the results fit into the observed systematics of total reaction cross sections . however , the angular distributions are not shown here because they may be affected by the other cerium isotopes .",
    "the obtained results for @xmath2  are compared to predictions from recently published @xmath1-nucleus potentials @xcite and to the widely used potential by mcfadden and satchler @xcite .",
    "the example of @xmath0ce  is well - suited for a study of uncertainties for @xmath2  at low energies because experimental scattering data are available down to relatively low energies .",
    "further information on the @xmath1-nucleus potential can be derived from reaction data at very low energies .",
    "often the ( @xmath1,n )  reaction has been used for this purpose ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , but in the present case there are no experimental data for the @xmath0ce(@xmath1,n)@xmath3nd reaction . instead , the reverse @xmath3nd(n,@xmath1)@xmath0ce  reaction will be investigated here .",
    "the elastic scattering angular distributions are analyzed in the usual way within the framework of the optical model and a complex @xmath1-nucleus optical potential .",
    "details of the fitting procedure for this local fit are similar to refs .",
    "@xcite and are only briefly summarized here .",
    "the total potential @xmath17 is composed of the real coulomb potential @xmath18 and the complex nuclear potential @xmath19 .",
    "the coulomb potential is calculated from a homogenously charged sphere where the coulomb radius is taken from the root - mean - square ( @xmath20 ) radius of the real folding potential ( see below ) .",
    "properties of the real and imaginary part of the nuclear potential are presented in the next paragraphs .",
    "the real part of the nuclear potential is determined by a double - folding procedure where the folding potential @xmath21 is modified by a strength parameter @xmath22 and a width parameter @xmath23 : @xmath24 the strength parameter @xmath22 and the width parameter @xmath23 will be adjusted to the experimental @xmath0ce(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0ce  angular distributions .",
    "obviously , the width parameter @xmath23 should remain close to unity ; otherwise , the folding potential would be questionable .",
    "the strength parameter @xmath22 is typically around 1.1 to 1.4 leading to volume integrals per interacting nucleon pair of @xmath25mev@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "( as usual , the negative signs of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are neglected in the following discussion . )",
    "the calculation of the folding potential requires the density of the @xmath0ce  target nucleus which is usually derived from electron scattering . although no data are available in the widely used compilation @xcite , two papers @xcite use a @xmath0ce  density and refer to a `` complementary , high - precision , elastic electron scattering experiment performed at saclay '' with the reference `` d.  goutte _ et al .",

    "the resulting folding potential is very close to the average of the potentials for the neighboring @xmath16 nuclei @xmath29la and @xmath30nd ; thus , the reliability of the unpublished electron density of @xmath0ce  from @xcite is confirmed .",

    "[ cols=\">,>,^ , > , > \" , ]     the similarity of the total reaction cross sections @xmath2  from the different global potentials can be understood from a semi - classical interpretation of the reflexion coefficients @xmath11 in the partial wave analysis .",
    "the following discussion will focus on the shown energies of 31.11mev above the coulomb barrier and 14.28mev below the coulomb barrier ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] for the potentials and fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] for the reflexion coefficients @xmath11 and the contributions @xmath13 of the @xmath14-th partial wave to @xmath2 ) .",
    "the discussion extends a similar study in @xcite .",
    "small angular momenta @xmath14 correspond to small impact parameters or central collisions . at energies above the coulomb barrier the incoming @xmath1  particles",
    "are able to reach the interior , and the corresponding partial waves are almost fully absorbed : @xmath33 for @xmath34 and thus @xmath35 .",
    "the linear increase of @xmath13 is nicely seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ( indicated by the brown line ) .",
    "consequently , only very few @xmath1  particles are scattered into the backward angular region where the cross section is found to be much smaller than the rutherford cross section .",
    "large angular momenta @xmath14 correspond to large impact parameters or peripheral collisions and scattering to forward angles .",
    "these partial waves do not reach the nuclear interior and are thus practically not absorbed : @xmath36 and @xmath37 is found for @xmath38 .",
    "potentials have to fulfill two simple criteria to provide @xmath2  above the coulomb barrier with sufficient accuracy .",
    "first , the potential must have the correct short range ; then @xmath36 for @xmath38 is automatically obtained .",
    "second , the imaginary part must be sufficiently strong to guarantee @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "these two simple criteria are necessary but not yet sufficient for an excellent @xmath1-nucleus potential which should simultaneously describe elastic angular distributions with reasonable @xmath39 .",
    "both simple criteria are fulfilled by all global potentials in this study .",
    "the origin for differences in @xmath2  from different realistic potentials can only stem from a few @xmath11 or @xmath13 for intermediate angular momenta @xmath40 .",
    "but even in this intermediate @xmath14 range the @xmath13 have to decrease from @xmath41 down to @xmath37 .",
    "thus , it is not at all surprising that different global potentials provide very similar @xmath2  at energies above the coulomb barrier . as a test",
    "i have increased the imaginary part of the local potential at 31.11mev by a factor of 2 and a factor of 10 ( ! ) .",
    "as expected , this leads to only very moderate enhancements of the total reaction cross section @xmath2  by about 1% and 8% although the corresponding elastic angular distributions change by more than one order of magnitude in the backward angular region .",
    "the situation is much different at lower energies below the coulomb barrier . again",
    ", partial waves with large angular momenta @xmath14 are not much affected by any short - range potential , and @xmath36 is found .",
    "however , even @xmath1  particles with small impact parameters will mostly not be able to tunnel through the coulomb barrier .",
    "thus , the elastic cross section at backward angles rises and approaches the rutherford cross section , and the @xmath11 remain close to unity even for small @xmath14 .",
    "the total cross section @xmath2  is now composed of the contributions from a few partial waves with low @xmath42 in the chosen example of 14.28mev .",
    "it is surprising that even under these conditions the various potentials under study provide very similar @xmath2  ( see table [ tab : sigtot ] ) , and indeed significant variations have been found in the analysis of the recent @xmath6pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath43pm  reaction data at slightly lower energies @xcite .",
    "let me now artificially decompose the absorption into an interior contribution ( @xmath44 ) and an exterior contribution ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "it is the aim of this analysis to find out the radial range of the potential which mainly defines @xmath2 .",
    "a semi - classical decomposition as e.g.  presented in @xcite may be misleading here because the semi - classical approximation deviates from a fully quantum - mechanical calculation by several per cent @xcite which is not acceptable at very low energies .",
    "for completeness it has also to be pointed out that `` exterior '' in the above sense means radii above @xmath46fm where the nuclear real and imaginary potentials have practically dropped to values close to zero ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] ) .",
    "consequently , `` interior '' corresponds to the radial range where the nuclear potentials deviate from zero , and `` interior absorption '' is dominated by the surface absorption by the surface imaginary potential .",
    "the interior contribution requires that the incoming @xmath1-particle tunnels through the coulomb barrier and reaches an area where it is absorbed by the imaginary part of the potential .",
    "it is thus mainly sensitive to the shape of the coulomb barrier which in turn is defined by the exterior of the real part of the nuclear potential whereas details of the imaginary part are not so important .",
    "this is similar to the full absorption for small @xmath14 at higher energies , but only very few @xmath1  particles are able to tunnel through the coulomb barrier at very low energies .",
    "an exterior contribution is obtained from the tail of the imaginary potential for large radii ; it does practically not depend on the real part .",
    "this tail is weak but affects all incoming @xmath1  particles .",
    "the relative importance of the interior and exterior contributions can be estimated by a variation of the strengths of the real and imaginary nuclear potentials or by introducing a cutoff radius @xmath47 for the imaginary potential ( @xmath48 for @xmath49 ) .",
    "it is found that at energies around 12mev an enhancement of the real part by a factor of two increases @xmath2  by a factor of about 3 whereas an enhancement of the same factor of two for the imaginary part increases @xmath2  only by about 40% ; i.e. , the interior absorption is dominating at these energies .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that a cutoff for the imaginary potential at @xmath50fm reduces @xmath2  by less than 10% .    at much lower energies the relative contribution of the exterior absorption increases , and at about 6mev",
    "it is found that a factor of two enhancement of the real part and the imaginary part both lead to the same factor of two enhancement for @xmath2 .",
    "a cutoff radius of @xmath50fm for the imaginary part now reduces @xmath2  by about a factor of 6 , and even a huge @xmath51fm still leads to a reduction of @xmath2  by almost a factor of two .    in other words",
    "this means that the prediction of @xmath2  at very low energies requires detailed knowledge of the nuclear potential at very large distances .",
    "the real part at large distances is essential for the internal contribution at energies of about @xmath52mev , and the imaginary part at large distances is important for the external contribution which dominates at very low energies far below 10mev .",
    "however , the sensitivity of elastic scattering data to the potential at large radii is limited .",
    "it is obvious that the reproduction of @xmath2  is a necessary requirement for any global potential ; but this requirement is almost automatically fulfilled at energies above the coulomb barrier .",
    "further investigation is needed on the question whether such a global potential is able to predict reaction cross sections of @xmath1-induced reactions below the coulomb barrier .",
    "it remains an open question which deviation ( e.g.  in @xmath39 ) remains allowed in the description of elastic scattering data to ensure a reasonable prediction of low - energy @xmath1-induced reaction cross sections . in this context",
    "an interesting example is the potential of frhlich and rauscher @xcite ; it has been optimized for the calculation of reaction cross sections and works very well for this purpose , but it shows larger deviations than other global potentials in the analysis of elastic scattering angular distributions .",
    "table [ tab : sigtot ] shows that the relative uncertainty of @xmath2  increases strongly with decreasing energy .",
    "this is not surprising because the elastic scattering angular distribution approaches the rutherford cross section at low energies .",
    "this holds in particular for the lowest energy where the ratio to the rutherford cross section is above 0.8 even at the most backward angles ; thus , very precise data are required here .",
    "unfortunately , these data of watson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite are not available numerically and have been extracted from fig .  2 of @xcite in the exfor @xcite database .",
    "using these exfor data leads to poor fits with parameters outside the expected range and @xmath2  @xmath53 mb .",
    "i have carefully repeated the digitization of the data in fig .  2 of @xcite , and",
    "i have obtained significantly larger elastic cross sections at backward angles .",
    "now the fit provides parameters in the expected range , and i find a smaller total reaction cross section of @xmath2  = 28.1 mb .",
    "it is interesting to note that the original analysis in @xcite using a woods - saxon potential gives an almost identical total reaction cross section of @xmath2  = 27.8 mb .",
    "this confirms the newly digitized data .",
    "these revised data will be sent to exfor",
    ".    for comparison of various targets at different energies , often reduced total reaction cross sections @xmath54",
    "= @xmath2@xmath55 are plotted versus the reduced energy @xmath56  = @xmath57 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the data for many @xmath1-nucleus systems are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigred ] .",
    "it is obvious that the new data for @xmath0ce  fit nicely into the global systematics .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that various global potentials @xcite provide almost identical @xmath54  in the energy range above @xmath56  @xmath58mev ( @xmath59mev ) whereas significant deviations between the different potentials are only found at very low energies .",
    "it should be kept in mind that at these very low energies ( @xmath56  @xmath60mev ) the total reaction cross section is dominated by inelastic scattering , mainly by coulomb excitation , but not by compound formation .      the extraction of @xmath2  from elastic scattering angular distributions is possible with reasonable uncertainties as long as the deviation from the rutherford cross section exceeds the experimental uncertainties significantly .",
    "the watson data at 15mev fulfill this requirement with @xmath61 ( i.e. , a deviation from rutherford of about 20% ) at backward angles and claimed experimental uncertainties of less than 5% .",
    "however , at slightly lower energies the extraction of @xmath2  becomes impossible even with typical uncertainties of up - to - date high - precision scattering data @xcite which are still of the order of a few per cent ( systematic plus statistical uncertainties ) .",
    "a test calculation has been made at @xmath62mev ( @xmath63mev ) in the following way .",
    "first , the angular distribution at this energy is calculated from the atomki - v1 potential from @xmath64 to @xmath65 in steps of @xmath66 . here",
    "i find @xmath67 at the most backward angles .",
    "next , several virtual experimental data sets are created from this angular distribution by randomly varying each data point within its uncertainty ( gaussian distribution with an assumed 3% 1-@xmath68 uncertainty , corresponding to the most precise available scattering data @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the various virtual data sets are analyzed in the usual way by fitting the parameters of the optical potential . here",
    "i use two parametrizations : ( @xmath69 ) a folding potential in the real part and a surface woods - saxon potential in the imaginary part ( i.e. , the same parametrization as the underlying atomki - v1 potential ) , and ( @xmath70 ) a volume woods - saxon potential in the real and in the imaginary part . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : virt ] .",
    "as expected , it is found that the fits become relatively unstable , and restrictions on the number of fitted parameters have to be used .",
    "the obtained total reaction cross sections from the fits to the virtual data sets vary between about 5 and 20 mb ( i.e.  vary by a factor of four ) whereas the starting value from the atomki - v1 potential was 8.8 mb .",
    "thus , the uncertainty for the derived @xmath2  is at least a factor of two at the low energy of @xmath71mev which is dramatically larger than the about 15% uncertainty obtained at the slightly higher energy of 14.28mev .",
    "however , the largest deviations for @xmath2  are correlated with extreme fitting parameters and unusually oscillating angular distributions ( e.g.  in the case of the 4@xmath72 virtual data set ) . constraining the resulting parameters to a reasonable range",
    "may allow to determine @xmath2  even in the case of the 4@xmath72 virtual data set ; but such constraints put into question whether this is still a model - independent determination of @xmath2 .",
    "a simple constraint might be to fix the geometry of the potentials from data at higher energies , e.g.  by taking the average values of @xmath23 in the real part and @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the imaginary part from table [ tab : pot ] .",
    "then only two parameters ( @xmath22 and @xmath75 ) remain to be adjusted to the data sets .",
    "however , even in this very restricted parameter space total reaction cross sections @xmath2  between about 5 and 20 mb have been found , and it remains necessary to keep @xmath22 and @xmath75 close to their expected values to obtain values of @xmath2  close to the initial @xmath2  = 8.8 mb .",
    "so the lower limit for the determination of @xmath2  seems to be reached around @xmath76mev even if high - quality scattering data are available over the full angular range .",
    "recently , experimental data for the @xmath3nd(n,@xmath1)@xmath0ce  reaction have been measured at energies below 1mev @xcite and between 4 and 6mev @xcite , and earlier data below 10mev are available from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath3nd(n,@xmath1)@xmath0ce  reaction cross section in the statistical model requires the knowledge of the @xmath0ce-@xmath1  potential .",
    "because of the huge positive @xmath78-value of 9.72mev , this potential has to be determined at energies around 15mev for the higher - energy data in @xcite .",
    "this is exactly the energy range of the watson _",
    "et al . _",
    "scattering data @xcite where the various potentials under study were able to reproduce @xmath2  within about @xmath79% ( see table [ tab : sigtot ] ) .",
    "thus , the uncertainty from the @xmath1-nucleus potential in the calculation of the @xmath3nd(n,@xmath1)@xmath0ce  reaction remains very limited .",
    "i have calculated the cross sections using the default parameters of @xcite and the mcf potential in the @xmath1  channel .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : na ] .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data above 1mev @xcite is reasonable although the energy dependence of the data points is not perfectly reproduced . at energies below 1mev",
    "the experimental data of @xcite are overestimated which is a typical behavior for the mcf potential at energies significantly below the coulomb barrier , see e.g.  for @xmath43sm(@xmath1,@xmath4)@xmath80gd @xcite , @xmath6pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath43pm @xcite , @xmath81sn(@xmath1,@xmath4)@xmath82te @xcite , and @xmath83cd(@xmath1,@xmath4)@xmath84cd @xcite .",

    "[ fig : na ] , brown line .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the @xmath3nd(n,@xmath1)@xmath0ce  reaction cross section is mainly sensitive to the optical potential in the @xmath1  channel whereas the other ingredients of the statistical model codes have only minor influence on the ( n,@xmath1 )  cross section ( for details see the sensitivity figures shown in ref .",
    "as expected , the two codes provide very similar results for energies below 1mev .",
    "however , above 1mev surprisingly significant differences up to a factor of two appear .",
    "interestingly , the calculation shows a similar energy dependence as the experimental data points @xcite but it underestimates the abolute scale significantly .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present paper to provide a detailed comparison of the and codes .",
    "the disagreement between both codes may be related to the treatment of excited states in the exit channel ( i.e. , in the @xmath0ce  nucleus ) ; this sensitivity is not explicitly studied in @xcite . but different choices of this treatment in lead only to minor variations of about 20% for the ( n,@xmath1 )  cross section and can not explain the factor of two discrepancy between and . therefore , great care is required in the determination of the @xmath1-nucleus potential from low - energy reaction data because the influence of other ingredients on the calculated cross sections has to be investigated in detail .",
    "nevertheless , the influence of different potentials on the @xmath3nd(n,@xmath1)@xmath0ce  reaction cross section can be studied at low energies below 1mev where and show the expected agreement for the mcf potential .",
    "it is found that the mcf potential overestimates the experimental data by a factor of 5 . as this energy range below 1mev corresponds to energies in the @xmath1-channel of about 10mev , it is possible to estimate @xmath2  at this energy because @xmath2  is only sensitive to the chosen @xmath1-nucleus potential : @xmath2  @xmath85b . for comparison ,",
    "the predictions from the different potentials under study at 10mev are also listed in table [ tab : sigtot ] .",
    "it is technically difficult to use the atomki - v1 folding potential in the or codes .",
