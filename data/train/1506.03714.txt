    "one of the simplest modifications of general relativity ( gr ) with improved infrared ( ir ) behavior that could possibly explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe is massive gravity ( mgr ) , a topic which has been around since the work of fierz and pauli in 1939 @xcite but received a revived interest in the past decade for various reasons and in various forms ( see the excellent reviews on the subject @xcite ) . at the lowest order , in four dimensions ,",
    "the lagrangian density is that of the fierz - pauli ( fp ) theory @xmath0 + { \\cal l}_{\\text{matter}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which propagates a non - ghost , non - tachyonic massive ( with mass @xmath1 ) spin-2 particle with all 5 helicity modes in flat backgrounds .",
    "_ by construction _",
    ", at the level of the lagrangian , or at the level of the field equations , as @xmath1 @xmath2 , gr is smoothly recovered .",
    "but it is well - known that once the newtonian potential is computed between two static sources or when deflection of light is computed as it passes a static source , one of these two results can be matched to the gr value by redefining the newton s constant but the other one does not smoothly reproduce the newtonian ( or the gr ) limit . for example the potential energy in mgr between two static sources reads @xmath3 and as @xmath1 @xmath2 , one has the famous van dam - veltman - zakharov ( vdvz ) @xcite discontinuity which has been known since early 1970s .",
    "all this is well established in the literature .",
    "but , what is rather interesting is that , only recently @xcite , another discontinuity between gr and mgr was found in the spin orientations of spinning point masses ( such as two widely separated stars , galaxies or galaxy clusters ) . in gr , the spin - spin interaction ( when other interactions such as tidal forces etc are neglected ) can be computed as @xmath4,\\label{general_relativity}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the spins of the sources and @xmath7 is the radial vector between them .",
    "( here , spin refers to rotation about an axis passing through the object which we approximately take as point - like . ) .        on the other hand , in mgr",
    ", the same quantity can be found as @xcite @xmath8 , \\label{mgr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    , spins are parallel and point in the direction perpendicular to the axis joining the sources . for small separations mgr",
    "reduces to gr.,width=15 ]    observe that as @xmath1 @xmath2 , exponential decay part is expected since massive gravity is weaker at large distances and even perhaps , one could expect , just like the newtonian potential case , a discrete numerical difference in the overall factor of the potential .",
    "but , what is highly surprising is the discrete numerical difference between the two spin - spin terms in ( [ mgr ] ) : as @xmath9 @xmath10 , one has    @xmath11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which differs discretely from that of gr ( [ general_relativity ] ) .",
    "but that is _ not _ the whole surprise : as we expect from the newtonian attraction such a discrete discontinuity might arise .",
    "the real surprise is that this numerical difference leads to different observable spin orientations in these two theories . while gr favors anti - parallel spins ( as shown in figure 1 ) , minimizing the total spin of the system",
    "; massive gr favors parallel spins perpendicular to the line joining the sources , maximizing the total spin of the system ( as shown in figure 2 ) .",
    "the fact that a tiny mass leads to such a remarkable effect is rather amazing .",
    "a detailed analysis in @xcite , actually shows that for a given graviton mass @xmath1 , for distances that satisfy @xmath12 the spin of the system is maximized as shown in figure 2 . on the other hand , for distances that satisfy @xmath13",
    ", massive gravity agrees with gr and spin of the system is minimized . at the point @xmath14 ,",
    "the relative coefficient between the two terms in ( [ mgr ] ) becomes @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , as expected at the large separations in the universe , mgr can show its effects on the orientations of galaxies or galaxy clusters . in the conclusion section",
    ", we will point out to some possible observations along these lines .    encouraged by these interesting results , in this work",
    ", we continue our analysis on the other and higher order gravitomagnetic effects in massive gravity as well as higher derivative gravity theories .",
    "we shall assume that the two spinning sources also have velocities , hence orbital motion which will yield additional effects that could probably lead to interesting differences between gr and mgr .",
    "our computations in quadratic gravity are in some sense academic in nature since the differences will arise in uv not in ir : at large separations , clearly one expects gr to dominate over the quadratic terms , but at small separations , quadratic terms are more effective .",
    "let us say a few words about how we shall proceed to compute the promised effects . the `` canonical '' way of finding gravitomagnetic effects in a given gravity theory at the weak field , small velocity , small spin limit is to find the linearized kerr solution of the theory and to compute the `` motion '' of a spinning , orbiting test particle in this geometry .",
    "but this is a rather long and cumbersome procedure , instead of that we shall employ a more clean - cut method , that is , we will compute the tree - level scattering amplitude due to one graviton exchange between two covariantly conserved sources .",
    "details of this procedure has been laid out in @xcite but it pays to recapitulate here for the sake of completeness .",
    "the lay - out of the paper is as follows : in section ii , and iii we show how the gravitomagnetic potential energy including all the terms up to desired order can be computed from the tree - level scattering amplitude . in section iv , which is the bulk of the paper , we give a detailed derivation of the potential energy for the moving , spinning masses in both gr and mgr .",
    "some of the details of the computations are relegated to the appendix . in section",
    "v , we calculate the analogous expressions for quadratic gravity ( with no explicit fierz - pauli mass term ) .",
    "to relate the potential energy at the desired order to the scattering amplitude , let us follow @xcite and compute the vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude in the path integral formalism between two sources :    @xmath16 = \\int { \\cal{d}}\\ , h_{\\mu \\nu }   e^{i s [ h , t ] } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is a large time that will drop at the end and @xmath18 $ ] is the linearized action about a background ( @xmath19 in a generic gravity model which reads @xmath20= \\int d^d x   \\sqrt{-\\bar{g } } \\big \\ { - \\frac{1 } { \\kappa } h^{\\mu \\nu } { \\cal { e}}_{\\mu \\nu}(h)+   h^{\\mu \\nu } t_{\\mu \\nu } \\big \\}.\\ ] ] from this follow the linearized field equations @xmath21 covariant conservation of @xmath22 leads to @xmath23 .",
    "let us employ the background field method to recast the path - integral in a more manageable form .",
    "for this purpose , suppose @xmath24 satisfies ( [ field_eqn ] ) , then make a change of variables in the path - integral as @xmath25 which does not change the measure , but shifts the action to the decoupled form @xmath20= \\int d^d x   \\sqrt{-\\bar{g } } \\big \\ { - \\frac{1 } { \\kappa } h^{\\mu \\nu } { \\cal { e}}_{\\mu \\nu}(h)+\\frac{1}{2 } \\bar{h}^{\\mu \\nu } t_{\\mu \\nu } \\big \\}.\\ ] ] the second term is free of @xmath26 so we can move it out of the path - integral and the first term , being independent of @xmath22 , simply rescales the normalization factor , yielding @xmath27 = { \\cal{n } } e^{\\frac { i}{2}\\int d^d x \\sqrt{-\\bar{g}}\\ , \\bar{h}^{\\mu \\nu } t_{\\mu \\nu } } .\\ ] ] equation ( [ field_eqn ] ) is of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a self - adjoint operator whose green s function is defined as    @xmath30    therefore the particular solution of ( [ field_eqn ] ) can be formally written as    @xmath31    therefore one has the usual source - source interaction @xmath27 = { \\cal{n } } e^{\\frac{i \\kappa } { 4}\\int d^{d}x\\,\\int d^{d}x'\\sqrt{-\\bar{g}(x)}\\sqrt{-\\bar{g}(x ' ) } t^{\\mu\\nu}\\left(x\\right)g_{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta}\\left(x , x^{\\prime}\\right)t^{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right ) } , \\ ] ] from which we can read the potential energy ( up to an irrelevant constant ) as @xmath32 we have kept the discussion to the @xmath33-dimensional , for @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 .",
    "figure 3 represents the interaction .",
    "we shall compute the mentioned gravitomagnetic effects in three different theories : general relativity , ( linearized ) massive gravity and quadratic gravity . to be able to employ ( [ pot ] ) we need the propagators of these theories .",
    "all these theories have different propagators which require a lot of work to carry out the full computation . to reduce the amount of computation",
    ", we shall use the `` master '' scattering amplitude that was found in @xcite , which upon taking the corresponding limits , generates the relevant scattering amplitudes in these three theories .",
    "there is a caveat though , to be able to smoothly reproduce the gr s and mgr s scattering amplitudes from one single expression , one must introduce o provisional cosmological constant which is set to zero before @xmath36 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the relevant action is , @xmath37 and the tree - level one graviton exchange in this theory is @xcite @xmath38 which looks rather cumbersome , but bear in mind that it encompasses all the information one needs for the theories that we are interested in .",
    "@xmath39 is the dalembertian in the @xmath40 background .",
    "the parameters that appear in this scattering amplitude are defined as @xmath41 where the effective cosmological constants can be found from @xmath42 . for gr , in flat space the proper limits are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 which yield @xmath46 where we have suppressed the integral signs , but more explicitly one has @xmath47 where we have employed the scalar green s function which is easier to handle @xmath48 with the flat space dalembertian @xmath49 . in the explicit computations below , we use the retarded green s function which are easily found as @xmath50,\\label{laplacian_green}\\ ] ] for the massless case and @xmath51,\\label{massive_greens}\\ ] ] for the massive case . here",
    "@xmath52 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "up to this point we have kept the discussion to be in generic @xmath33 dimensions , but from now on we shall stick to the @xmath34 dimensional case . in @xcite , spin - spin interaction was found in @xmath33 dimensions but because the spin is a higher rank tensor in more than 4 dimensions , the expressions become quite non - trivial , even if the computations are straightforward .    before we close this section ,",
    "let us digress a little bit and compute the interaction of two massless sources ( say photons ) moving at the speed of light , the ultra relativistic limit that we shall avoid in the rest of this work , and reproduce the old , amusing result of @xcite , that two anti - parallel moving light beams attract each other , while two parallel moving beams do not interact at all ( note that @xcite has a nice discussion on this issue ) .",
    "let the four velocities be @xmath53 where @xmath54 refers to parallel motion and @xmath55 anti - parallel motion .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for each photon is @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "vanishing of the trace immediately says that the result will be the same in gr and mgr .",
    "then one has , @xmath58 upon carrying out the integrals one arrives at @xmath59 which yield the potential energy between these two photons as @xmath60 so clearly photons that move parallel to each other do not see each other ( @xmath61 ) at this level of approximation ( namely the weak field limit and neglecting the spins ) .",
    "as noted this is also valid in mgr .",
    "can this amusing result have observable consequences ?",
    "imagine two photons created by two infinitesimally close sources in a far away pulsar ( or some other source ) , and travel side by side towards the earth for billions of years .",
    "if they interacted at all this would clearly have some non - trivial effects on their polarization .",
    "this discussion will be fully addressed elsewhere .",
    "consider two conserved sources , @xmath62 , each having the following energy - momentum tensor components @xcite    @xmath63    where the relevant parts read @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the location of the particle and @xmath66 refers to symmetrization with a @xmath67 factor .",
