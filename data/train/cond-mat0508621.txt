    "a controversial issue in the field of high temperature superconductivity is the nature of the intrinsic quasiparticle damping . given the structural similarities of the different cuprate compounds and the similar doping dependence of many of their physical properties it is natural to expect the dominant mechanism of quasiparticle scattering to be universal . the experimental situation , however , is currently unclear .",
