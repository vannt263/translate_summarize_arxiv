    "in this paper we continue our study @xcite of the temporal aspects of tunneling considered in our approach as a combined stochastic process to consist from two alternative elementary ones , transmission and reflection , evolved coherently . in @xcite we have introduced the transmission and reflection times provided that a particle is in a localized state .",
    "these time scales were extracted from the time dependence of the average positions of transmitted and reflected particles .",
    "it is evident that this way of timing a particle is not applicable in the limiting case , when the particle is in some stationary state described by a non - normalized wave function .",
    "this case is of great importance , since it is connected to the scattering of uniform beams of identically prepared particles , noninteracting with each other . to find a time spent by transmitted and reflected particles in the barrier region , in the stationary scattering problem , is the main aim of the present paper .",
    "how to obtain the wave functions for transmission and reflection , for a given potential and initial wave function , is presented in @xcite . here",
    "we expose both the functions in the form to be more suitable for our purpose .",
    "let setting the scattering problem be such as in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will suppose that the rectangular potential barrier of height @xmath0 is localized in the interval @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "then the wave functions for transmission , @xmath2 , and reflection , @xmath3 , can be written for @xmath4 as follows ( @xmath5 is the energy of a particle ) .    for @xmath6 @xmath7 for @xmath8 @xmath9 for @xmath10 @xmath11 for @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16,@xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 is the mass of a particle .",
    "besides , @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 in its turn , @xmath26 @xmath27    one can easily check that @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the coefficients of transmission and reflection , respectively ( @xmath33 ) ; @xmath34 . thus , @xmath35 .",
    "note , both the stationary wave functions are non - normalized and , hence , the standard timing procedure becomes usefulness in timing a particle with the well defined energy . at the same time the properties of these wave functions",
    "provide another natural way for timing a particle in the barrier region .",
    "indeed , the density of the probability flux , @xmath36 , for @xmath2 is everywhere constant and equals to @xmath37 .",
    "this means that the velocity of this flux , @xmath38 , can be written as @xmath39 taking into account exps .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) - ( [ 4 ] ) for @xmath2 , we see that outside the barrier region @xmath40 . in the barrier region ,",
    "the velocity of the flux decreases exponentially when it approaches the midpoint @xmath41 .",
    "one can easily show that @xmath42 , but @xmath43 .",
    "thus , any selected infinitesimal element of the flux passes the barrier region for the time @xmath44 , where @xmath45    one can easily show that @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , taking into account exps .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) - ( [ 4 ] ) ) , we obtain @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49=-\\frac{1}{\\kappa^2}(\\kappa^2+k^2)t\\sinh(2\\varphi).\\ ] ] eventually , we have @xmath50;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51    similarly , for @xmath52 @xmath53;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 @xmath55 , if @xmath56 ; otherwise , @xmath57",
    "as is seen , the above time scale for transmission ( [ 5 ] ) ( though the way of introducing is different ) coincides by form with the well - known bttiker s dwell time ( see @xcite ) . however , unlike the latter , exp .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) describes only transmitted particles .",
    "doing in the spirit of the bttiker s dwell - time concept , we introduce the dwell time for reflection , @xmath58 , as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the incident probability flux ( note , the probability flux for @xmath61 itself is zero ) .    considering the expressions for @xmath61",
    "one can easily show that for @xmath62 @xmath63 for @xmath52 @xmath64",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the phase - time and old dwell - time concepts , @xmath65 , do not imply the passage to the case of a free particle , that is , when @xmath66 . at the same time",
    ", our concept of the asymptotic times for transmission and reflection ( see @xcite ) ensures this passage .",
    "one can easily check that the above dwell time for transmission implies this passage , too .",
    "note , both the characteristic times are nonnegative quantities .",
    "let @xmath67 be the time spent by a free particle in the interval @xmath1 $ ] : @xmath68 .",
    "then one can show that for barriers , in the limit @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , we have @xmath71;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for wells , @xmath72.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , not only for @xmath73 , but also for @xmath74 @xmath75 when @xmath76 remind ( see @xcite ) , the @xmath77 in the latter case .",
    "remind , the bttiker s dwell time for @xmath62 read as ( see @xcite ) @xmath78 for @xmath52 @xmath79    it is useful to compare formally a new dwell - time scale ( to describe transmitted and reflected particles separately ) with bttiker s dwell time to describe all particles jointly .",
    "figs.1 and 2 show the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 , respectively . figs .",
    "3 and 4 show the dependence of @xmath65 , @xmath44 and @xmath86 on the barrier s width @xmath87 for @xmath84 , @xmath88 and @xmath84 , @xmath89 , respectively . in all cases , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the mass of an electron .",
    "as is seen , @xmath44 and @xmath65 coincide at the points of resonance .",
    "however , this result is expected .",
    "besides , @xmath92 is more smooth function than @xmath93 moreover , except for some neighborhoods of resonant points , @xmath94    our results show that the most essential difference between these time scales takes place for @xmath62 ( see figs.2 and 4 ) . in particular , fig.4 shows that @xmath44 increases exponentially when the width of an opaque potential barrier increases .",
    "at the same time @xmath95 ( as well as the well - known phase tunneling time and our asymptotic times for transmission and reflection ) tends , in this case , to some constant value .    as regards @xmath58 ( see ( [ 30 ] ) , ( [ 31 ] ) ) , in this limit @xmath96 note also , @xmath97 for wells ( @xmath98 ) , when @xmath99 however , in the case of resonance , when @xmath100 @xmath101 at @xmath102",
    "as is known , the just mentioned property of the phase and dwell tomes is excepted to lead to superluminal velocities of a particle in the barrier region ( the well - known hartman effect ) .",
    "however , we see that the behavior of @xmath44 , in contrast to the bttiker s dwell time , denies the existence of the hartman effect for a particle with the well - defined energy .",
    "however , from our study it follows that this effect does not appear also for a particle whose initial state is described by the wave packet of any width .",
    "fig.5 shows the expectation value of the particle s position as a function of @xmath103 .",
    "it was calculated for the transmitted wave packet providing that @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 . at @xmath107 the ( combined )",
    "state of the particle is described by the gaussian wave packet peaked around @xmath108 ; its half - width @xmath109 ; the average energy of the particle @xmath110 .",
    "this figure displays explicitly the difference between the exact and asymptotic transmission times . while the former gives just the ( average )",
    "time spent by a particle in the barrier region , the latter describes , in fact , the ( average ) lag or outstripping of a transmitted particle with respect to a free particle whose average velocity equals to the asymptotic average velocity of a scattered particle .    in the case considered ( see fig.5 ) the exact transmission time equals approximately to @xmath111 , the asymptotic one is of @xmath112 , and @xmath113 . as is seen , the dwell time for transmission and exact transmission time , both evidence that , though the asymptotic transmission time is small for this opaque barrier , transmitted particles spend much time in the barrier region .",
    "note , the possibility of accelerating a particle in the region of an opaque potential barrier , to superluminal velocities , is doubtful _ a priori_.",
    "the point is that the average energy of a particle , @xmath114 , is constant for this static potential barrier .",
    "thus , for the average kinetic ( @xmath115 ) and potential ( @xmath116 ) energies of a particle we have , for any @xmath103 , @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the average kinetic energy of transmitted particles at @xmath107 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath119 if @xmath56 .",
    "hence , at the stage of scattering , @xmath115 may only decrease .",
    "of course , this fact does not at all mean that the average velocity of a particle , at the stage of scattering , can not be larger than its asymptotic value .",
    "the point is that @xmath120 @xmath121 is the particle s momentum .",
    "thus , @xmath122 may increase due to diminishing the wave - packet s width in the momentum space .",
    "our calculations show that this takes place near the barrier region ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "thus , when approaching the left boundary of the barrier , the particles is accelerated , on the average . as a result , it may overcome the potential barrier .",
    "when the particle enters the barrier region , it almost stops .",
    "the region of an opaque potential barrier serves as a storage of particles . behind the barrier",
    "the average velocity of particles may first exceed its own asymptotic value .",
    "however , far from the barrier , when the width of the wave packet , in the momentum space , backs to its initial ( asymptotic ) value , the same does the average velocity of particles .",
    "note , the more is the part of @xmath123 in the average kinetic energy of a particle at @xmath107 , the larger may be the grows of the particle s velocity near the barrier region .",
    "however , one has to bear in mind that this velocity can not essentially exceed the value , @xmath124 .",
    "so that , as it follows from our approach , tunneling a particle through an opaque potential barrier must not be accompanied by the hartman effect .",
    "so , in our approach , the state of the whole quantum ensemble of tunneling particles is considered as a coherent superposition of the states of the subensembles of transmitted and reflected particles . for a given potential and initial state of a particle",
    ", there is an unique pair of solutions to the one - dimensional schrdinger equation , which describe both the subensembles at all stages of tunneling . for each of these subensembles",
    "we have introduced three time scales .",
    "two of them ( the exact and asymptotic tunneling times ) describe a completed scattering process .",
    "the third time scale ( the dwell time ) relates to the stationary tunneling problem .",
    "it should be stressed that the asymptotic ( transmission and reflection ) times differ from the well - known phase asymptotic times .",
    "the dwell times for transmission and reflection differ from the bttiker s dwell time .",
    "analysis of tunneling a particle through an opaque rectangular barrier , carried out in the framework of our approach , does not confirm the existence of the hartman effect .    at the end we have to point to some shortcomings of the above time concepts .",
    "so , the concept of the exact tunneling times does not give explicit expressions for these quantities ; besides , it is not suitable for timing a particle with the well - defined energy ( this becomes more evident in the case of the reflection of wide ( in @xmath125-space ) wave packets , when the expectation value of the particle s position simply does not `` enter '' the barrier region ) .",
    "the main shortcoming of the dwell - time concept is that it is valid only for the stationary scattering process .",
    "the our next purpose is to present the concept of the larmor times for transmission and reflection . by our opinion ,",
