    "the analogues in continuous time of the galton  watson branching processes ( g - w processes ) are the continuous - state branching processes ( csbp ) .",
    "this class of markov processes was originally introduced by jirina and lamperti ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these processes are the only possible weak limits that can be obtained from sequences of rescaled g - w processes ( see @xcite or @xcite ) . the properties of csbp have been extensively studied ( see grey @xcite or bingham @xcite ) .",
    "lamperti has shown that a general csbp can be obtained from a lvy process without negative jump by a random time change .",
    "the laplace exponent @xmath3 of the lvy process is called the branching mechanism of the csbp and it characterizes its law via a differential equation solved by the laplace exponent of the process .",
    "when one considers sequences of rescaled g - w processes with some fixed offspring distribution @xmath4 on @xmath5 , the possible limit processes are the csbp with stable branching mechanism , that is , @xmath6 , for some positive @xmath7 and @xmath1 in @xmath8 $ ] ( see @xcite ) . in the case",
    "@xmath9 , the corresponding csbp is the feller diffusion .    in this work",
    "we use some recent results concerning the genealogical structure of csbp that can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our basic object is the g - w tree with offspring distribution @xmath4 that can be seen as the underlying family tree of the corresponding g - w process started with one ancestor ; this random tree is chosen to be rooted and ordered ( see neveu @xcite for a rigorous definition ) .",
    "if @xmath4 is critical or subcritical , the g - w tree is almost surely finite and it can be coded by two different discrete processes : the contour process and the height process that are both defined at the beginning of section 2 .",
    "these two processes are not markovian in general but they can be written as a functional of a certain left - continuous random walk whose jump distribution depends on @xmath4 in a simple way .    if a sequence of rescaled g - w processes converges to a csbp with branching mechanism @xmath3 , then it has been shown in @xcite , chapter 2 , that the genealogical structure of the g - w processes converges too . more precisely , the corresponding rescaled sequences of contour processes and height processes , converge respectively to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the limit process @xmath11 is the height process in continuous time that has been introduced by le gall and le jan in @xcite . as in the discrete case , the height process is not markovian in general but it can be written as a functional of the lvy process without negative jump , with laplace exponent @xmath12 , that plays the role of the left - continuous random walk .    the case of a height process corresponding to a lvy process with finite variation paths is treated in @xcite .",
    "it has an interpretation in terms of queuing processes that has been used in some recent work of v. limic ( see @xcite ) . in the present article",
    ", we are only dealing with the case of the @xmath1-stable branching mechanism , with @xmath1 in @xmath13 $ ] . in that case",
    "the csbp is conservative and becomes extinct almost surely .",
    "a general theorem implies that the corresponding height process is continuous ( see theorem 4.7 . in @xcite or @xcite , chapter 1 ) and the convergence of the rescaled discrete height processes holds in a functional sense .",
    "furthermore , as explained in section 3 , the height process has a scaling property of index @xmath14 . in the brownian case @xmath2 ,",
    "the height process is proportional to a reflected standard brownian motion .    in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "aldous introduced the continuum random tree as the limit of rescaled g - w trees conditioned on the total progeny , in the case where the offspring distribution has finite variance .",
    "the continuum random tree is coded by a normalized brownian excursion , in a way similar to our coding of discrete trees through the height process . in the present work",
    ", we aim to extend aldous result to g - w trees with possibly infinite variance offspring distribution .",
    "more precisely , we assume that the offspring distribution of the g - w tree belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law with index @xmath1 in @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "we then show that the ( suitably rescaled ) discrete height process of the g - w tree conditioned to have a large fixed progeny , converges in a functional sense to the normalized excursion of the height process associated with the @xmath1-stable csbp .",
    "this is the main result of the present work and it is stated at the end of section 3 .",
    "we can think of our limiting process as the height process of an infinite tree : by analogy , we call it the @xmath15-stable continuum random tree . in the case",
    "@xmath16 , it coincides with aldous continuum random tree . at the end of the section 3",
    ", we also recall from @xcite , chapter 3 , the computation of finite dimensional marginals of the @xmath15-stable continuum random tree .",
    "the last section is devoted to the proof of the limit theorem .",
    "our approach relies on an idea used by kersting who introduced discrete bridges in @xcite to study the convergence of rescaled g - w processes conditioned on the total progeny , in the case of an infinite variance offspring distribution .",
    "the limiting procedure is made easier in terms of discrete bridges thanks to their good properties of absolute continuity with respect to the law of the unconditioned random walk . in section 4.1 , we show that the height process of the g - w tree conditioned on its total progeny has the same law as a certain functional of the discrete bridge . in the next section , we state a similar result in the continuous setting .",
    "then , we pass to the limit on functionals of discrete bridges .",
    "the identification of the limit process as the normalized excursion of the continuous height process involves several arguments that depend on continuity properties of the vervaat transform ( see @xcite ) and on certain path - decompositions of the @xmath15-stable lvy bridge that are due to chaumont .",
    "in this section , we introduce the contour process and the height process of a galton  watson tree with a critical or subcritical offspring distribution . each of these processes provides a coding of the tree .",
    "the height process can be written as a simple functional of a left - continuous random walk .",
    "this observation explains the definition of the continuous height process , that is given in a forthcoming section .",
    "the results of this section are elementary and we refer to @xcite and @xcite for details .    the trees considered in the present article are rooted ordered trees .",

    "let us set some notation .",

    "the value @xmath80 of the contour process at time @xmath81 is the distance from the root to the position of the particle at time @xmath81 . see figure 1 for an example .    more formally , we denote by @xmath82 the @xmath83 leaves of @xmath43 listed in lexicographical order .",

    "the contour process can be recovered from the height process through the following transform .",
