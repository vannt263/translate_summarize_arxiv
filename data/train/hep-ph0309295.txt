    "for many years now , spin physics has played a very prominent role in qcd .",
    "the field has been carried by the hugely successful experimental program of polarized deeply - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) , and by a simultaneous tremendous progress in theory .",
    "this talk summarizes some of the interesting new developments in spin physics in the past roughly two years .",
    "as we will see , there have yet again been exciting new data from polarized lepton - nucleon scattering , but also from the world s first polarized @xmath0 collider , rhic .",
    "there have been very significant advances in theory as well .",
    "it will not be possible to cover all developments .",
    "i will select those topics that may be of particular interest to the attendees of a conference in the `` dis '' series .",
    "until a few years ago , polarized inclusive dis played the dominant role in qcd spin physics @xcite . at the center of attention was the nucleon s spin structure function @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a recent compilation  @xcite of the world data on @xmath1 .",
    "these data have provided much interesting information about the nucleon and qcd .",
    "for example , they have given direct access to the helicity - dependent parton distribution functions of the nucleon , @xmath2 polarized dis actually measures the combinations @xmath3 . from @xmath4 extrapolation of the structure functions for proton and neutron targets it has been possible to test and confirm the bjorken sum rule @xcite .",
    "polarized dis data , when combined with input from hadronic @xmath5 decays , have allowed to extract the  unexpectedly small ",
    "nucleon s axial charge @xmath6 , which to lowest order unambiguously coincides with the quark spin contribution to the nucleon spin @xcite .      the results from polarized inclusive dis have also led us to identify the next important goals in our quest for understanding the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "the measurement of gluon polarization @xmath7 rightly is a main emphasis at several experiments in spin physics today , since @xmath8 could be a major contributor to the nucleon spin .",
    "also , more detailed understanding of polarized quark distributions is clearly needed ; for example , we would like to know about flavor symmetry breakings in the polarized nucleon sea , details about strange quark polarization , and also about the small-@xmath9 and large-@xmath9 behavior of the densities .",
    "again , these questions are being addressed by current experiments .",
    "finally , we would like to find out how much orbital angular momentum quarks and gluons contribute to the nucleon spin .",
    "ji showed @xcite that their total angular momenta may be extracted from deeply - virtual compton scattering , which has sparked much experimental activity also in this area .",
    "there are several lepton - nucleon scattering fixed - target experiments around the world with dedicated spin physics programs",
    ". this will not be a complete list ; i will mention only those that play a role in this talk .",
    "hermes at desy uses hera s 27.5  gev polarized electron beam on polarized targets .",
    "they have just completed a run with a transversely polarized target .",
    "semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) measurements are one particular strength of hermes .",
    "compass at cern uses a 160  gev polarized muon beam .",
    "their main emphasis is measuring gluon polarization ; they have completed their first run .",
    "there is also a very large spin program at jefferson lab , involving several experiments .",
    "large-@xmath9 structure functions and the dvcs reaction are just two of many objectives there . finally , an experiment e161 at slac aims at measuring @xmath8 in photoproduction , but has unfortunately been put on hold awaiting funding . for the more distant future , there are plans to develop a polarized electron - proton _ collider _ at bnl , erhic @xcite .    a new milestone has been reached in spin physics by the advent of the first polarized proton - proton collider , rhic at bnl . by now , two physics runs with polarized protons colliding at @xmath10  gev have been completed , and exciting first results are emerging .",
    "we will see one example toward the end of this talk .",
    "all components crucial for the initial phase of the spin program with beam polarization up to 50% are in place @xcite .",
    "this is true for the accelerator ( polarized source , siberian snakes , polarimetry by proton - carbon elastic scattering ) as well as for the detectors .",
    "rhic brings to collision 55 bunches with a polarization pattern , for example , @xmath11 in one ring and @xmath12 in the other , which amounts to collisions with different spin combinations every 106  nsec .",
    "it has been possible to maintain polarization for about 10 hours",
    ". there is still need for improvements in polarization and luminosity for future runs .",
    "the two larger rhic experiments , phenix and star , have dedicated spin programs focusing on precise measurements of @xmath8 , quark polarizations by flavor , phenomena with transverse spin , and many others .      as mentioned above , the measurement of @xmath8 is a main goal of several experiments .",
    "the gluon density affects the @xmath13-evolution of the structure function @xmath1 , but the limited lever arm in @xmath13 available so far has left @xmath8 virtually unconstrained .",
    "one way to access @xmath8 in lepton - nucleon scattering is therefore to look at a less inclusive final state that is particularly sensitive to gluons in the initial state .",
    "one channel , to be investigated by compass in particular , is heavy - flavor production via the photon - gluon fusion process @xcite .",
    "an alternative reaction is @xmath14 , where the two hadrons in the final state have large transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "rhic will likely dominate the measurements of @xmath8 .",
    "several different processes will be investigated @xcite that are sensitive to gluon polarization : high-@xmath15 prompt photons @xmath16 , jet or hadron production @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and heavy - flavor production @xmath19 . in addition , besides the current @xmath10  gev , also @xmath20  gev will be available at a later stage .",
    "all this will allow to determine @xmath21 in various regions of @xmath9 , and at different scales .",
    "one can compare the @xmath8 extracted in the various channels , and hence check its universality implied by factorization theorems . in this way",
    ", we will also likely learn a lot more about high-@xmath15 reactions in qcd .",
    "we emphasize that for all the reactions relevant at rhic we now know the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the underlying hard scatterings of polarized partons @xcite .",
    "this significantly improves the theoretical framework , since it is known from experience with the unpolarized case that the corrections are indispensable in order to arrive at quantitative predictions for hadronic cross sections .",
    "for instance , the dependence on factorization and renormalization scales in the calculation is much reduced when going to nlo . therefore ,",
    "only with knowledge of the nlo corrections will one be able to extract @xmath8 reliably .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows nlo predictions @xcite for the double - spin asymmetry @xmath22 for the reaction @xmath23 at rhic , using various different currently allowed parameterizations @xcite of @xmath21 .",
    "it also shows the statistical errors bars expected for a measurement by phenix in @xmath23 with lower polarization and luminosity were reported by phenix @xcite .",
    "] under the assumption of 50% beam polarizations and 7/pb integrated luminosity .",
    "it is evident that the prospects for determining @xmath8 in this reaction , and in related ones , are excellent .",
    "we stress that phenix has recently presented a measurement of the unpolarized high-@xmath15 @xmath24 cross section @xcite that agrees well with an nlo perturbative - qcd calculation over the whole range of @xmath15 accessed .",
    "this provides confidence that the theoretical hard scattering framework used for fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is indeed adequate .      as mentioned earlier , inclusive dis via photon exchange",
    "only gives access to the combinations @xmath25 .",
    "there are at least two ways to distinguish between quark and antiquark polarizations , and also to achieve a flavor separation .",
    "semi - inclusive measurements in dis are one possibility , explored by smc @xcite and , more recently and with higher precision , by hermes @xcite .",
    "one detects a hadron in the final state , so that instead of @xmath26 the polarized dis cross section becomes sensitive to @xmath27 , for a given quark flavor . here ,",
    "the @xmath28 are fragmentation functions , with @xmath29 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the latest results on the flavor separation by hermes @xcite , obtained from their lo monte - carlo code based `` purity '' analysis . within the still fairly large uncertainties , they are not inconsistent with the large negative polarization of @xmath30 in the sea that has been implemented in many determinations of polarized parton distributions from inclusive dis data @xcite ( see curves in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is no evidence either for a large negative strange quark polarization . for the region @xmath31",
    ", the extracted    @xmath32 integrates @xcite to the value @xmath33 , while analyses of inclusive dis prefer an integral of about -0.025 .",
    "there is much theory activity currently on sidis , focusing also on possible systematic improvements to the analysis method employed in @xcite , among them nlo corrections , target fragmentation , and higher twist contributions @xcite .",
    "we note that at rhic @xcite one will use @xmath34 production to determine @xmath35 with good precision , making use of parity - violation .",
    "comparisons of such data taken at much higher scales with those from sidis will be extremely interesting .",
    "new interesting information on the polarized quark densities has also recently been obtained at high @xmath9 .",
    "the hall a collaboration at jlab has published their data for the neutron asymmetry @xmath36 @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( left ) .",
    "the new data points show a clear trend for @xmath36 to turn positive at large @xmath9 .",
    "such data are valuable because the valence region is a particularly useful testing ground for models of nucleon structure .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the extracted polarization asymmetry for @xmath37 .",
    "the data are consistent with constituent quark models @xcite predicting @xmath38 at large @xmath9 , while `` hadron helicity conservation '' predictions based on perturbative qcd and the neglect of quark orbital angular momentum @xcite give @xmath39 and tend to deviate from the data , unless the convergence to 1 sets in very late .",
    "besides the unpolarized and the helicity - dependent densities , there is a third set of twist-2 parton distributions , transversity @xcite . in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) they measure the net number ( parallel minus antiparallel ) of partons with transverse polarization in a transversely polarized nucleon : @xmath40 in a helicity basis , one finds @xcite that transversity corresponds to a helicity - flip structure , as shown in fig .",
    "this precludes a gluon transversity distribution at leading twist .",
    "it also makes transversity a probe of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd @xcite : perturbative - qcd interactions preserve chirality , and so the helicity flip required to make transversity non - zero must primarily come from soft non - perturbative interactions for which chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "measurements of transversity are not straightforward .",
    "again the fact that perturbative interactions in the standard model do not change chirality ( or , for massless quarks , helicity ) means that inclusive dis is not useful .",
    "collins , however , showed @xcite that properties of fragmentation might be exploited to obtain a `` transversity polarimeter '' : a pion produced in fragmentation will have some transverse momentum with respect to the fragmenting parent quark .",
    "there may then be a correlation of the form @xmath41 .",
    "the fragmentation function associated with this correlation is the collins function .",
    "the phase is required by time - reversal invariance .",
    "the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "the    collins function would make a _ leading - power _",
    "@xcite contribution to the single - spin asymmetry @xmath42 in the reaction @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is the angle between the lepton plane and the @xmath47 plane ( and the transverse target spin ) .",
    "as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , this asymmetry would allow access to transversity if the collins functions are non - vanishing .",
    "a few years ago , hermes measured the asymmetry for a longitudinally polarized target @xcite . for finite @xmath48 , the target spin then has a transverse component @xmath49 relative to the direction of the virtual photon , and the effect may still be there , even though it is now only one of several `` higher twist '' contributions @xcite .",
    "if `` intrinsic '' transverse momentum in the fragmentation process plays a crucial role in the asymmetry for @xmath50 , a natural question is whether @xmath51 in the initial state can be relevant as well .",
    "sivers suggested @xcite that the @xmath51 distribution of a quark in a transversely polarized hadron could have an azimuthal asymmetry , @xmath52 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "there is a qualitative difference between the collins and sivers functions , however . while phases will always arise in strong interaction final - state fragmentation",
    ", one does not expect them from initial ( stable ) hadrons , and the sivers function appears to be ruled out by time - reversal invariance of qcd @xcite . until recently",
    ", it was therefore widely believed that origins of single - spin asymmetries as in @xmath53 and other reactions were more likely to be found in final - state fragmentation effects than in initial state parton distributions .",
    "however , then came a model calculation @xcite that found a leading - power asymmetry in @xmath54 not associated with the collins effect .",
    "it was subsequently realized @xcite that the calculation of @xcite could be regarded as a model for the sivers effect .",
    "it turned out that the original time - reversal argument against the sivers function is invalidated by the presence of the wilson lines in the operators defining the parton density .",
    "these are required by gauge invariance and had been neglected in @xcite . under time reversal , however , future - pointing wilson lines turn into past - pointing ones , which changes the time reversal properties of the sivers function and allows it to be non - vanishing . now ,",
    "for a `` standard '' , @xmath51-integrated , parton density the gauge link contribution is unity in the @xmath55 gauge , so one may wonder how it can be relevant for the sivers function .",
    "the point , however , is that for the case of @xmath51-dependent parton densities , a gauge link survives even in the light - cone gauge , in a transverse direction at light - cone component @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "thus , time reversal indeed does not imply that the sivers function vanishes .",
    "the same is true for a function describing transversity in an unpolarized hadron @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing that these new results are based entirely on the wilson lines in qcd .",
    "if the sivers function is non - vanishing , it will for example make a leading - power contribution to @xmath53 , of the form @xmath57 this is in competition with the collins function contribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) ; however , the azimuthal angular dependence is discernibly different .",
    "hermes has just completed a run with transverse polarization , and preliminary results are expected soon .",
    "we note that the collins function may also be determined separately from an azimuthal asymmetry in @xmath58 annihilation @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that comparisons of dis and the drell - yan process will be particularly interesting : from the properties of the wilson lines it follows that the sivers functions relevant in dis and in the drell - yan process have opposite sign , violating universality of the distribution functions .",
    "this is a striking prediction awaiting experimental testing . for work on the process ( in)dependence of the collins function ,",
    "see @xcite ; recent model calculations of the function in the context of the gauge links may be found in @xcite .",
    "originally , the sivers function was proposed @xcite as a means to understand and describe the significant single - spin asymmetries @xmath59 observed @xcite in @xmath60 , with the pion at high @xmath15 .",
    "these are inclusive `` left - right '' asymmetries and may be generated by the sivers function from the effects of the quark intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath51 on the partonic hard - scattering which has a steep @xmath15 dependence .",
    "the resulting asymmetry @xmath59 is then power - suppressed as @xmath61 in qcd , where @xmath62 is an average intrinsic transverse momentum .",
    "similar effects may arise also from the collins function .",
    "fits to the available @xmath59 data have been performed recently @xcite , assuming variously dominance of the collins or the sivers mechanisms .",
    "an exciting new development in the field is that the star collaboration has presented the first data on @xmath63 from rhic @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "as one can see , a large @xmath59 persists to these much higher energies .",
    "[ fig9 ] also shows predictions based on the collins and the sivers effects @xcite , and on a formalism @xcite that systematically treats the power - suppression of @xmath59 in terms of higher - twist parton correlation functions ( for a connection of the latter with the sivers effect , see @xcite ) .",
    "the star data clearly give valuable information already now .",
    "for the future , it will be important to extend the measurements to higher @xmath15 where the perturbative - qcd framework underlying all calculations will become more reliable .",
    "it was recognized some time ago that certain fourier transforms of generalized parton densities with respect to momentum transfer give information on the position space distributions of partons in the nucleon @xcite . for a transversely polarized nucleon",
    ", one then expects @xcite a distortion of the parton distributions in the transverse plane , which could provide an intuitive physical picture for the origins of single - spin asymmetries .",
    "we finally note that _",
    "double_-transverse spin asymmetries @xmath64 in @xmath0 scattering offer another possibility to access transversity .",
    "candidate processes are drell - yan , prompt photon , and jet production .",
    "recently , the nlo corrections to @xmath65 have been calculated @xcite .",
    "the results show that @xmath64 is expected rather small at rhic .",
