    "hadron productions via various scattering processes have been one of the most important experimental and theoretical methods to investigate the strongly - interacting systems , which are governed by the fundamental theory , i.e. _ quantum chromodynamics _ ( qcd ) , in terms of the color - singlet degrees of freedom . among the various production processes ,",
    "photo and electro - productions have been proved to be very useful .",
    "since the photon is a clear probe , these production processes are well suited for investigating hadronic properties , such as the structures , the reaction mechanisms , and so on .",
    "moreover , the nonstrange - meson electro and photoproductions are an extremely good method to investigate the baryon - resonance search . on top of these specific features , according to the gauge - boson nature of the photon , the photocoupling constrains the scattering processes in such a way that the ward - takahashi ( wt ) identity must be satisfied to all orders of feynman diagrams . due to this constraint",
    ", one can simply identify the necessary feynman diagrams for a certain scattering process .",
    "experimentally and theoretically , meson electro and photoproductions have been well studied in various ways .",
    "for instance , in the previous work  @xcite , employing the rarita - schwinger formalism for spin-@xmath13 fermions , it turns out that the contact term interaction , which is responsible for conserving the wt identity , plays a dominant role for the @xmath14 photoproduction .",
    "if this is the case , there appears the difference of the production rate between those from the proton and neutron targets related to their isospin structures in each reaction process .",
    "interestingly enough , this theoretical consequence has been confirmed by the experiments  @xcite , and supported theoretically  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the formalism used in refs .",
    "@xcite reproduced the presently available data qualitatively very well  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent beam - energy upgrades of the experimental facilities , such as the clas12 at jefferson laboratory  @xcite and the leps2 at spring-8  @xcite , may shed light on the measurements for new high - energy data for various photo and electroproduction processes .    in consideration with the success of the theoretical framework employed in refs .",
    "@xcite and the present experimental situation mentioned above , we are motivated to investigate the charged pion ( @xmath15 ) photoproduction off the proton target with @xmath16 baryon , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , beyond the resonance region @xmath3 gev .",
    "although there are other isospin channels in the final @xmath19 state , we would like to focus on these charged pion productions in the present work , because of the abundant experimental data for these specific channels .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that these elementary processes are important ingredients to study two pion photoproduction @xmath20 . as for the low - energy region ,",
    "the photo and electroproductions for these elementary - reaction process were already investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in those works , it turns out that the reaction process contains various contributions , such as those of the born terms including the nucleon and baryon resonances , the final- ( fsi ) and initial - state ( isi ) interactions , and the regge poles .",
    "however , as will be shown in the later sections of the present work , only the born terms and regge pole contributions almost saturate the reaction process in the high - energy region beyond the resonance region @xmath3 gev . in , ref .",
    "@xcite , the scattering amplitude for @xmath21 was also parameterized phenomenologically by a simple one - pion exchange .",
    "the regge poles and absorption corrections were employed for the @xmath7-photoproduction in ref .",
    "@xcite    as a theoretical framework , as done in refs .",
    "@xcite , we make use of the effective lagrangian method and mesonic regge trajectories . since we are interested in the energy range beyond the resonance region as mentioned , we will not consider the resonant contributions in the present work for simplicity .",
    "thus , our strategy to investigate the @xmath7 photoproduction is quite simple : we take into account the @xmath4- and @xmath5-meson regge trajectories in the @xmath6 channel for describing the high - energy experimental data , in addition to the tree - level born terms , such as the the proton- and @xmath7-pole , in the @xmath8- and @xmath9-channels respectively , and contact - term contributions . in treating @xmath7 theoretically , we make use of the rarita - schwinger vector - spinor formalism  @xcite . in addition to these ingredients ,",
    "we also take into account an interpolation between the feynman and regge propagators in the t - channel meson - exchange , considering that the regge contributions can still affect on the process even in the low energy region .",
    "we utilize an ansatz devised for this purpose , which was proved essential to reproduce the low- and high - energy data simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "all the relevant scattering amplitudes are constructed in terms of the tree - level born approximation without resonant contributions as mentioned . to consider the spatial distributions of the hadrons involved , we introduce the hadron form factors in a gauge - invariant scheme which preserves the ward - takahashi identity with the regge propagators as done in  @xcite .    from the numerical analyses",
    ", we will compute the energy and angular dependences of the cross sections , polarization - transfer coefficients , and @xmath11 decay - angle distribution of the process under various conditions .",
    "it turns out that unpolarized physical quantities , such as the energy and angular dependences are reproduced qualitatively well beyond the resonance region @xmath3 gev as compared to the presently available experimental data .",
    "we also discuss the appearance of the strong peak in the forward - scattering region which is decreasing as the photon energy increases .",
    "it turns out that this forward peak is generated by the @xmath6-channel pseudoscalar - meson ( @xmath4 ) exchange .",
    "the angular dependence @xmath22 shows that the present framework is not enough to reproduce the experimental data for the region , where @xmath23 gev and @xmath24 .",
    "nevertheless the present theoretical framework provides a very good agreement with the experimental data for the high - energy region beyond @xmath25 gev .",
    "especially , the interpolation of the feynman and regge propagators plays an important role to reproduce the data appropriately . from the numerical results for the @xmath11 decay - angle distribution ,",
    "e find that the contribution of the @xmath5-meson exchange is small , but the contact - term contribution and the @xmath4-exchange are significant both of which compete with each other in the relatively low energy region .",
    "in contrast , only the contact - term contribution dominates the process in the high - energy region .",
    "the present work is structured as follows : in section ii , we briefly explain the theoretical formalism such as the effective lagrangians for the relevant interactions , gauge - invariant scheme for the form factors , and mesonic regge trajectories to compute the reaction process which we are interested in .",
    "numerical results and related discussions are given in section iii .",
    "we summarize and close with a conclusion in section iv .",
    "in this section , we explain the theoretical framework for the present calculations for the @xmath26 reaction process .",
    "first , we present the relevant feynman diagrams for the present reaction process at the tree - level born approximation in fig .",
    "the four momenta of the particles involved are also given there .",
    "we will consider the @xmath27-channel baryon and meson exchanges , and the contact - term contributions .",
    "the contact term is necessary for preserving the wt identity of the scattering amplitude as shown in  @xcite .",
