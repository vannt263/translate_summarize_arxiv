    "the ww domains are a family of fast - folding , compact , modular domains featuring a triple - stranded , anti - parallel beta - sheet owing their name to the presence of two highly conserved triptophanes ( w ) .",
    "recent studies @xcite suggested that these domains may fold at a rate close to the speed limit for @xmath1-sheet formation offering the opportunity to investigate the pathways of @xmath1-sheet kinetics .",
    "in particular , the human pin1 protein ww domain , due to the availability of several structural  @xcite , thermodynamical and kinetic  @xcite experimental data , represents an excellent target to test computational techniques and theoretical approaches .",
    "the structure of this domain , resolved through nmr  @xcite and x - ray diffraction  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] ) , is characterized by hydrophobic clusters providing the largest contribution to the thermodynamic stability  @xcite .",
    "cluster 1 ( cl1 ) involves residues leu7 , trp11 , tyr24 and pro37 , the second cluster ( cl2 ) comprises tyr23 , phe25 and arg14 .",
    "the stability of the molecule also derives from a network of hydrogen - bonds whose central element is the highly conserved asn26 located on strand @xmath2 and acting both as donor and acceptor in bonds with pro9 , trp11 , ile28 and thr29 , thus linking strands @xmath3 and @xmath4 . the presence of two loops . loop i ( l1 ) plays a key role in substrate recognition  @xcite as it binds to the phosphate of the motif of the proline - rich ligands , loop ii ( l2 ) , instead , gives an important contribution to thermal stability  @xcite .",
    "thermal denaturation experiments @xcite and simplified statistical physics approaches @xcite have shown that the pin1 ww domain folds following cooperative two - state mechanism at the temperature @xmath5 k. the mutagenesis analysis performed by the same authors @xcite identified the mutations on ser16 , ser18 and ser19 in loop i as maximally destabilizing for the transition state , so that the formation of l1 appears to be the rate - limiting step in the folding / unfolding process . loop ii ( l2 ) is involved in the formation of the transition state only at high temperatures  @xcite . due to the ability of inducing conformational changes in proline - rich , phosphorilated substrates , pin1 is a potential regulator of the cell - cycle , and maybe involved in pathologies like liddle s syndrome , muscular dystrophy and alzheimer s disease  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is the comparison of two off - lattice protein descriptions : the g - model @xcite which customary allows studying the influence of the native state structure on the folding process , and a model proposed by sorenson and head - gordon @xcite ( hereafter referred to as shg ) , mainly based on the primary and secondary structural information .",
    "the conceptual justification of topology - based or native centric models relies on the observation that the topology of native states can play a crucial role in selecting some features of the folding mechanism @xcite .",
    "the main experimental finding supporting the above statement can be summarized as follows ( baker @xcite ) : ( a ) the similarity shared by transition - state conformations and folding mechanisms of proteins having structurally related native states despite their low sequence homology @xcite and ( b ) the correlation that certain simple topological properties , such as contact order , may have with protein folding rates @xcite . the g - force field is independent of the amino acid sequence , and it requires the knowledge of the tertiary structure of native states to identify native interactions . accordingly , the native centric approach can not be used for ab initio predictions of native folds , even if recent works @xcite provide growing evidence that it can be confidently used for the characterization of transition states of real small , fast - folding ( sub - millisecond ) @xcite proteins that are characterized by a low level of energetic frustration . however",
    ", topological models might not correctly reproduce the folding process when chemical interactions play a relevant role .",
    "the shg model , which is instead based on the chemical and physical properties of amino - acids such as hydrophobicity , is in principle better applicable to proteins with a higher level of energetic frustration .",
    "moreover , requiring the knowledge of primary and secondary structures only , the model has a greater predictive power , and in this sense , could be considered closer to an ab initio representation .",
    "the above arguments motivate a detailed comparison between the these two protein models to assess their applicability and potentialities in the study of biomolecules .",

    "when native state topology plays the relevant role in driving the folding process , many molecular details of protein structures can be mapped onto simplified coarse - grained models encoding the overall topology through the knowledge of the native contacts .",
    "these models , neglecting side chains and peptide groups , reduce a protein chain to its backbone , where aminoacids are assimilated to beads centred on their @xmath6 carbon atoms . the g energy function , mimicking a perfect funnel landscape , assigns to the native state the lowest energy by simply promoting the formation of native interactions . here",
    "we employ the force field proposed by clementi _",
    "@xcite with distance cutoff @xmath7  @xcite to to identify native contacts in the structure 1nmv.pdb .",
    "a native contact means that the distance , @xmath8 , of c@xmath9 atoms relative to residues @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is less than @xmath13 in the native state .",
    "this pair undergoes an attractive lj - interaction @xmath14 \\label{eq : vnat}\\ ] ] with equilibrium distance @xmath8 . when two residues are not in a native contact ( @xmath15 ) they interact through a repulsive potential @xmath16 with @xmath17   .",
    "these non - native interactions , besides ensuring the self - avoidance of the chain , generally enhance the cooperativity of the overall folding process @xcite .",
    "a further bias towards the native secondary structure is introduced through a bending and a dihedral potential .",
    "the former is modeled as an harmonic function and allows only small oscillations around the native angles ( @xmath18 ) formed by three consecutive residues @xmath19 with harmonic constant @xmath20 .",
    "the most important determinant of the secondary structure is the dihedral potential arising from the torsional energy .",
    "each dihedral angle , identified by four consecutive beads , contributes to the potential with the terms @xmath21 +   k_{\\phi}^{(3)}[1 - \\cos3(\\phi_{i } - \\phi_{i}^{0})]\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the value of angle @xmath10 in the native structure , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "finally , consecutive residues interact with each other through the potential harmonic in their distance @xmath25 @xmath26 which maintains the chain connectivity , with @xmath27 being the native bond - length and @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the global g - potential reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 if the contact is native ( non - native ) .",
    "g models of the type just outlined may produce a gradual folding behaviour being uncapable to reproduce the typical kinetic cooperativity of two - state folders .",
    "experimental studies suggest @xcite that the origin of cooperativity lies in specific interactions appearing only after the assembly of native - like structures .",
    "these particular interactions can be modeled by imparting an extra energetic global stabilization to the native state @xcite through a different analytical form of the energy function when the chain visits the native basin . in the present work",
    "we need to implement the rescaling method to make the folding transition highly cooperative in agreement with the experiments on the ww domain .",
    "the interaction forces on the residues are thus computed according to the following rule @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fraction of formed native contacts and @xmath33 is the scaling factor .",
    "the force rescaling determines a higher free energy barrier between the folded and unfolded state in correspondence of the folding temperature resulting in a higher cooperativity .",
    "therefore , the residence times in the folded and unfolded state are expected to be significantly longer .",

    "this interaction is repulsive and the @xmath42 term , which accounts for the hydration shell around the hydrophilic residues , makes the potential longer ranged than the usual @xmath43 .",
    "the forces involving neutral residues are also repulsive and amount to an excluded volume potential by setting @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the secondary structure arises as a result of bending and dihedral interactions , which surrogate side - chain packing and hydrogen - bonding .",

    "indeed , each dihedral , in the chain , is defined to be either helical ( h : @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) , extended ( e : @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , or turn ( t : @xmath54 ) .",
    "therefore , the primary structure must be complemented with the auxiliary sequence , of `` e , h , t ''",
    "symbols assigning the appropriate set of coefficients .",
    "the decoupling between primary and dihedral sequence , not present in similar models ( 40,41 ) , increases the possibilities in the modulations of relative strengths between local and non - local interactions which results in a finer structural tuning @xcite .",
    "the head - gordon force field is completed by a bond angle interaction modelled as a harmonic potential @xmath55 with a constant @xmath56 so that large deviations from the equilibrium value @xmath57 rad are unlikely , and bond angles result basically fixed .",
    "also in this model , stiff springs ( [ harmonic ] ) with equilibrium distance @xmath58   , maintain the chain connectivity mimicking the presence of covalent peptide bonds between successive aminoacids . this stiff interaction allows to keep the bond length approximately fixed , while being less computationally demanding than the rattle algorithm used in previous works @xcite to enforce fixed bond lengths .",
    "the shg model retains only the minimal number of elements needed to capture the essential features of protein molecules , however , some strong determinants such as hydrogen bonding and side chains are missing .",
    "these limitations should be compensated through a design strategy @xcite for optimising the sequence . here , we used the sequence lbbnn - blblb - nlnnn - lbbbb- llnnl - bnbbl - lbnnl proposed in ref .",

    "theoretical @xmath0-values feature two major peaks in correspondence with loop l1 and loop l2 which is a qualitative resemblance with experiments .",
    "a more quantitative comparison is provided by the correlation coefficient between theoretical and experimental data amounting to @xmath144 .",
    "the set of native conformations collected during the kinetic simulation provides a structural characterization of the ensemble f whose",
    "most interesting feature is the clustering of native - basin conformations in two main subsets characterized by non overlapping distributions of rmsd from the reference structure @xmath118 .",
    "this is a further indication of the high level of frustration of the free - energy landscape associated to the sequence and it is in agreement with the findings by miller and wales @xcite about the glass - like structure of the energy landscape in a closely related model @xcite .",
    "this partitioning of the native basin is evident in figure  [ fig : shg_go_freek ] ,    .",
    "the native valley appears to be partitioned in two main sub - basins separated by a barrier .",
    "the sub - basin corresponding to the rmsd range @xmath145 $ ] is populated by conformations with the same chirality as the pdb structure , whereas the sub - valley in the range @xmath146 $ ] , corresponds to the opposite chirality .",
    "lower panel : low - temperature free energy profiles of the g model as a function of the rmsd from the native conformation ( pdb - id = 1nmv ) .",
    "the native valley shows a single basin as opposed to the partitioning in two sub - valleys typical of the g model . ]    where we plot the free energy versus the rmsd which is a structural indicator more sensitive than the overlap .",
    "a finer analysis reveals that the structures in the two sub - basins of the native valley correspond to different chiralities but similar energies .",
    "the absence of such a partitioning in the same plot for the g force field , indicates that this feature is mainly peculiar of the model rather than this specific protein .    to clarify how the landscape properties affect the reversibility of the folding process we studied the folding / unfolding transition from the contact formation probabilities @xmath147 .",
    "in particular , as the plots @xmath83 are typically sigmoid , a contact can be regarded as broken / formed in correspondence of the temperature , where the absolute value of the slope of the probability curve is maximal .",
    "this allows to identify the contacts whose formation / breakdown occurs at a given temperature .    to analyze the folding / unfolding process , we considered three temperature windows corresponding to different regions of the specific heat plots . the first window ( @xmath148 )",
    "refers to the pre - transition baseline of the @xmath130 plot , the second window ( @xmath149 ) insists on the region of the shoulder , and the third window ( @xmath150 ) includes the main peak .",
    "the contacts appearing or disappearing in correspondence of the three windows are shown in black , red and green respectively , in the contact maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shg_path ] ) summarizing the main events of the pathway .",
    "shaded symbols represent weak interactions with probability of formation below @xmath151 at the lowest simulation temperature @xmath114 .    ;",
    "red , @xmath149 ; green , @xmath150 .",
    "shaded symbols refer to weak contacts with low probability of formation ( @xmath152 ) at the lowest simulation temperature @xmath114 . ]",
    "the contact map shows that the first contacts formed during folding are located in the intermediate part of sheet @xmath3-@xmath2 and in the region of sheet @xmath2-@xmath4 most distant from loop 2 .",
    "the formation of these contacts is responsible for the collapse of the molecule into a compact but not completely folded conformation .",
    "the map also shows that the shoulder of the @xmath130 plot is characterized by the zipping of sheets @xmath3-@xmath2 and @xmath2-@xmath4 towards loop 1 and loop 2 respectively . during the process there",
    "also occurs the locking of @xmath3-@xmath4 , @xmath2-@xmath153 and @xmath154-@xmath2 contacts ( hereafter , the term head and tail indicate the amino - terminal region @xmath155 and the carboxy - terminal residues @xmath156 respectively ) .",
    "these contacts are not present in the pdb structure and they arise as a consequence of the higher compactness of @xmath118 , so that their formation probabilities are always below @xmath151 .",
    "the folding is completed by the appearence of a few contacts between residues very far from each other along the protein chain .    during the unfolding reaction",
    "no `` native '' ( with respect to @xmath118 ) contact breaks down in the low temperature window because the heating schedule enables the protein to escape easily from kinetic traps making the process much less gradual than folding .",
    "this reflects on the smaller number of contacts broken in the shoulder region as compared to the number of contacts formed in the same temperature range during folding .",
    "in particular , the cleavage occurs of @xmath3-@xmath4 , @xmath2-@xmath153 and @xmath154-@xmath2 contacts , whereas the dissolution of the contacts of loop 1 and loop 2 is delayed to the region of the peak of the @xmath130 plot where most @xmath3-@xmath2 and @xmath2-@xmath4 contacts also disappear .",
    "the comparison of the two contact maps thus reveals that the sequences of the molecular events in the folding and unfolding processes are basically reverse to each other even if the unfolding is a more abrupt phenomenon occurring in a narrower temperature window .",
    "our results indicate how the different approaches of structure - based and sequence - based description exemplified by g and shg model are appropriate to simulate complementary features of the folding process .",
    "the g model , in fact , being based on the influence of the native state topology on the folding process is independent from the amino - acid sequence and it completely disregards the chemical properties of the molecule . the shg model , on the other hand , is a minimal model , where the chemical features of amino - acids are partially included determining the folding driving force .",
    "our simulations showed that the g model with angular bias @xcite and rescaling @xcite can correctly reproduce the reversible , cooperative , two - state  mechanism of folding of hpin1 ww domain @xcite .",
    "the reversibility , indeed appears from the almost perfect superposition of the @xmath132 plots of folding and unfolding .",
    "several elements , on the other hand , suggest a cooperative , two - state mechanism : the @xmath132 plots show a single sharp peak , the ratio of the vant hoff to calorimetric enthalpy is close to 1 ( @xmath157 ) @xcite , all the indicators used to monitor the similarity with the native state exhibit a sharp sigmoidal thermal behaviour and the barrier between the two free - energy wells at the folding temperature is very high @xcite .",
    "the results from the simulation using the shg model were rather ambiguous .",
    "the simulated thermograms featured not only a peak , but also a shoulder at lower temperature .",
    "this is the signature of a non cooperative folding involving a collapse into a compact , only partially structured globule , followed by a rearrangement into a native conformation .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by the thermal behaviour of the structural parameters ( overlap , gyration radius and rmsd from native structure ) used to monitor the folding reaction .",
    "the results are consistent with the findings by nymeyer _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and by guo and brooks iii  @xcite , in their simulations on the model by honeycutt and thirumalai @xcite . the shg formulation , although being an improvement of the latter model , still retains some of its drawbacks .",
    "indeed , the conformations of the native ensemble ( f ) , sampled at the folding temperature , can be clustered in two groups with non - overlapping rmsd distributions and opposite chiralities @xcite .",
    "the existence of two distinct clusters of native - like conformations can be easily explained by examining the low - temperature free - energy profiles as a function of the rmsd ( from reference structure @xmath118 ) : the native basin appears to be partitioned in sub - basins separated by barriers .",
    "the partitioning of the native basin is likely a feature that the shg model inherited from thirumalai model .",
    "miller and wales  @xcite , in fact , analyzed the disconnectivity graph of the potential energy surface of thirumalai s force field drawing the conclusion that the energy hypersurface is not a single funnel , but it contains low - energy minima separated by high barriers .",
    "presumably , the reason for the degeneration of the native state of the shg model relies in the symmetry of the dihedral potential @xmath158 , eq .",
    "[ eq : vphi ] .",
    "in particular , the sequence designed to represent the hpin1 ww domain , contains only `` extended '' or `` turn '' symbols , so that @xmath158 is a polynomial in @xmath159 and becomes symmetric for the inversion @xmath160 .",
    "the symmetry of the @xmath158 term , however , is not the only reason for the poor performance of the shg model .",
    "in fact , we find that the energy histograms of the folded- and unfolded- state ensembles are significantly overlapping thus suggesting the existence of many low - energy , non - native conformations @xcite .",
    "we suspect that this is an effect of the only approximated maximization of the energy gap between the native conformation and the decoy set used in the sequence optimization procedure @xcite .",
    "this would call for further refinements of the threading procedure .    despite the several drawbacks , the shg model enabled the computation of perturbation @xmath0-values in qualitative agreement with experimental data .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient between theoretical and experimental @xmath0-values ( @xmath144 ) is actually better than the one yielded by the g simulation ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the explanation of these result must be sought in the partial incorporation of the chemistry in the shg description .",
    "indeed , real mutations are chemical transformations of the molecule and they are better simulated by a chemically - based model such as the shg rather than by a topological model . in the g model , in fact , mutations are generally simulated by the removal of native contacts @xcite , however , they may affect all the interactions a residue is involved in .",
    "the shg model , conversely , offers the possibility to treat mutations in a more realistic way because it implements shifts in the hydrophobic character of residues or changes in the secondary structural bias of dihedral angles .",
    "moreover , the better agreement of experimental data with the shg - computed @xmath0-values may show that the folding mechanism of hpin1 ww domain is controlled not only by topological but also by energetic factors .",
    "the significant differences , beyond statistical errors , between the @xmath0-values profiles yielded by the two models , in our opinion , reflect the different strategies upon which the two models are built .    a final issue that deserves some discussion is the quality of the structural prediction using the shg model .",
    "the shg is a minimal model based on chemical properties of the system and a good outcome of the simulation is not _ a priori _ guaranteed .",
    "the simulations show that , apart from chirality problems , the best final structure @xmath118 ( fig .  [ fig : struct ] ) presents the correct topology of a three - stranded antiparallel @xmath1-sheet of the hpin1 ww domain , even if the structure appears to be more compact .",
    "this however , does not prevent the correct formation of both hydrophobic clusters .",
    "moreover , @xmath118 shares 22 of the 41 native contacts of the pdb structure .",
    "we performed folding and unfolding simulations of the ww domain of hpin1 protein that represents an excellent candidate to test folding algorithms and models due to the availability of a large amount of structural , thermodynamical and kinetic experimental data .",
    "the purpose of the work was to compare the performance of the g and shg models that represent two different strategies to the folding problem .",
    "our simulations indicated that for the specific ww domain considered in this work , the g model with angular bias and rescaling , correctly reproduces the cooperative , two - state , reversible folding mechanism , whereas the shg model does not .",
    "the reasons for the limitations of the shg model must be sought in the insufficient optimization the sequence and in the non - funnel shape of the landscape . as a consequence , the present version of the shg model",
    "does not allow reliable predictions of the folding mechanism .",
    "the satisfactory performance of the shg model in the computation of @xmath0-values , however , clearly shows the importance of incorporating the chemical properties of the sequence in a protein model .",
    "our work , highlighting the limits of the shg model , is thus intended to be a starting point for a further refinement of the model , in the firm belief that coarse - grained , minimal models represent viable alternatives to computationally demanding all - atom simulations in investigations of large - sized , slow - folding proteins .",
