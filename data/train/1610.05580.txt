    "flow - induced vibrations transfer a fraction of the kinetic energy of the incoming flow to the solid structure that is set into motion .",
    "vibrations can then be used to power an electric generator and effectively convert some of the solid s mechanical energy into electrical form . recently",
    ", many classical examples of flow - induced vibrations have been revisited as potential energy harvesting mechanisms , including galloping  @xcite , coupled - mode flutter of airfoil profiles  @xcite , flutter of flexible cylinders or membranes in axial flow  @xcite , flapping in unsteady wakes  @xcite and vortex - induced vibrations ( viv ) of rigid and flexible structures  @xcite .",

    "the steady flow around a fixed bluff body at high reynolds number ( @xmath0 or inertial flows ) is characterized by an unsteady shedding of vortex structures .",
    "the wake structure is then complex and differs from a classical von - karman vortex street observed at lower @xmath1 , but its frequency spectrum is still dominated by a fundamental frequency known as the strouhal frequency @xmath2 , proportional to the flow velocity @xmath3 as @xmath4 with @xmath5 the strouhal frequency and @xmath6 the diameter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this results in an unsteady lift force on the bluff body . for a flexible or flexibly - mounted structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : intro_pic_viv_rigid_cable ] ) , this unsteady force will force the solid body into so - called vortex - induced vibrations , and this unsteady motion of the body will also introduce a feedback coupling on the vortex shedding and unsteady lift .",
    "viv of a rigid cylinder mounted on an elastic foundation have been widely studied , both experimentally and numerically ( see  @xcite . a distinctive feature of viv is the lock - in mechanism : when the fundamental frequency of the solid s vibrations is close to the strouhal frequency , the coupling between the vibrations and the vortex shedding synchronizes both dynamics over an extended range of flow velocity .",
    "this results in self - sustained , self - limited large amplitude oscillations of the solid , typically of the order of one cross - flow diameter .",
    "this lock - in phenomenon is particularly interesting for energy harvesting purposes since large amplitudes imply that the oscillating structure has a large amount of kinetic energy that can potentially be harnessed to produce electricity .",
    "the vivace system @xcite relies on that phenomenon .",
    "however , viv of elastically - mounted rigid cylinders also have intrinsic limitations .",
    "lock - in occurs only when the strouhal frequency and the eigenfrequency of the structure are sufficiently close , e.g. @xcite .",
    "if this condition is not met ( `` lock - out '' ) , the rigid cylinder is not properly excited by the flow and its oscillations have negligible amplitude , which results in inefficient energy extraction . geophysical flows ( e.g. oceanic , tidal or river currents ) are characterized by an important variability in the flow velocity magnitude , and systems relying on viv of rigid cylinders can only produce energy when the flow velocity remains close to the velocity for which they are designed .        a method to circumvent this issue is to use flexible structures ( cables , or beams ) rather than rigid cylinders , as sketched in fig .

    "fig : intro_pic_viv_rigid_cable ] : cables have multiple deformation modes which have their own eigenfrequencies and different modes can be locked - in for different values of the flow velocity ( and strouhal frequency ) .",
    "the selective excitation of a specific deformation mode of a flexible structure when the eigenfrequency of the latter is close to the strouhal frequency was demonstrated experimentally  @xcite and numerically  @xcite . rather than lock - out ,",
    "variations of the flow velocity induce a transition towards lock - in of higher or lower deformation modes .",
    "this advantage of flexible structures was recently demonstrated for a system consisting of a hanging cable in a cross flow , attached to a local energy harvester at its upper end  @xcite .",
    "the experimental and numerical results obtained for that system demonstrated its increased robustness to variations in the flow velocity in comparison with an elastically supported rigid system .    a challenge and open question associated with harvesting energy from viv of flexible structures is to determine the optimal harvesting strategy , i.e. where and how the mechanical energy of the solid structure should be converted into electricity . with a rigid cylinder , the motion is a pure translation with a single degree of freedom , and determining the optimal strategy is relatively simple . for flexible structures ,",
    "the periodic motion is not uniform throughout the structure , which results in a much larger configuration space for the harvesting distribution .",
    "optimization of such a system is a particular challenge .",

    "hence , the eigenmodes of the cable have constant frequencies . when the velocity of the flow increases , so does the strouhal frequency and as as a result higher modes are successively locked - in .",

    "[ fig : viv_efficiency_along_isodamping__rigid_heavy_nb]-a . the robustness of cross - flow catenaries to flow velocity variations therefore arises from their ability to adapt their deformation mode to the surrounding flow and remain at lock - in , which the rigid cylinder is unable to do since it only has a single resonance frequency .",
    "noticeably , the value of the relative span @xmath41 of cross - flow catenaries has only a minor impact on their efficiency in terms of optimal performance and robustness to flow velocity variations .",
    "interestingly , results obtained by @xcite show that the robustness to flow variations of cross - flow catenaries is comparable to that of hanging cables ( width of efficiency peak is 3.6 for the former and 3.7 for the latter ) .",
    "that observation agrees with the minor effect of the span @xmath41 on the performance of cross - flow catenaries in suggesting that the robustness of energy harvesting from a cable with gravity - induced tension is only determined by the mechanism of transitioning between mode lock - in and is independent of the cable shape .      for in - flow catenaries , buoyancy and gravity balance and the tension",
    "is induced by the flow drag and friction forces .",
    "it is therefore set by the flow velocity magnitude and larger flow velocity results in a larger tension in the catenary , that scales as @xmath173 .",
    "an increase in the flow velocity @xmath3 now has two consequences : ( i ) a linear increase in the strouhal frequency and ( ii ) a quadratic increase of the tension in the cable , resulting in a linear increase with @xmath3 of its eigenfrequencies .",
    "both fluid and solid frequencies increase in the same proportion , and the system passively adapts to remain at lock - in despite the flow variations .",
    "the efficiency is therefore only weakly dependent on the dimensional value of the flow velocity @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : viv_efficiency_along_isodamping__rigid_heavy_nb]-b ) .",
    "the robustness of in - flow catenaries to flow velocity variations therefore arises from the passive adaptation of their internal tension to the surrounding flow .",
    "such passive control is not possible with a rigid cylinder .",
    "this work presented a detailed and systematic analysis of the energy harvesting performance of flexible cables in viv . a fundamental symmetry - breaking in the optimal harvesting strategy",
    "was identified that leads to recommending a concentration of the energy harvesting devices near one of the fixed ends of the cable .",
    "we further showed that , out of all distributions possible along the entire cable , the very simplest one performs best , namely a single energy harvester located at one of the extremity of the cable ; beyond its fundamental importance , this result also has significant practical engineering implications .    with similar peak performance , flexible cables in viv",
    "are also significantly more robust than their rigid - cylinder counterpart with respect to variations in the flow velocity ( their range of efficient operation is three to eight times larger ) . in particular ,",
    "a fundamental physical insight on this increased robustness was obtained and two different mechanisms were identified : ( i ) the passive control by the flow velocity of the deformation mode ( for systems with gravity - induced tension ) and ( ii ) the passive control of the internal tension of the cable ( for systems with flow - induced tension ) ; both maintain the system at lock - in with high energy harvesting efficiency .    the best performing design is identified as an almost straight cable ( i.e. with minimal sag ) with flow - induced tension , which can be practically achieved with a neutrally - buoyant cable . from an engineering point of view , this system is not more difficult to build than a device based on a rigid cylinder , and fig .",
    "[ fig : viv_efficiency_vs_flow_fluctuations_final ] summarizes the comparison of its performance to the rigid - cylinder system .",
