    "the anomalous hall conductivity ( ahc ) @xmath5 due to intrinsic ahe shows the almost material - specific value that is independent of the relaxation time . the intrinsic ahe in heavy fermion compounds @xcite , fe @xcite , and ru - oxides @xcite had been studied intensively based on realistic multiband models . also , large spin hall effect ( she ) observed in pt and other paramagnetic transition metals @xcite , which is analog to the ahe in ferromagnets , is also reproduced well in terms of the intrinsic hall effect @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic ahe and she in transition metals originate from the berry phase given by the @xmath1-orbital angular momentum induced by the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , which we call the `` orbital aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect '' @xcite .    in particular ,",

    "this behavior strongly deviates from the kl - type conventional behavior @xmath12 .",

    "very recently , this problem was revisited by the present authors by considering the @xmath1-orbital degree of freedom and the atomic soi @xcite , and found that a drastic spin structure - driven ahe emerges due to the orbital ab effect , in the presence of non - collinear spin order .",

    "we find that the orbital ab effect causes large @xmath10-linear ahc , resulting from the combination of the non - collinear spin order ( including orders with zero scalar chirality ) and atomic soi .",
