    "the currently accepted theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , has an intricate structure which makes it difficult to be directly handled . for this reason ,",
    "simplified models have been largely employed over the last decades in trials to obtain clues about the behavior of interacting quarks . among them",
    "one of the most celebrated is the gross - neveu model @xcite , which considers the direct four - fermions interaction . in this paper",
    ", we consider the @xmath0-component tridimensional massive gross - neveu model , in the large-@xmath0 limit , compactified along one of the spatial directions . from a physical point of view",
    ", the model is intended to describe fermions bounded between two parallel planes , a distance @xmath2 apart from one another .",
    "we will call from now on _ quarks _ the fermions associated to the fermionic field , being understood that we are dealing with the quanta resulting from the quantization of the gross - neveu model .",
    "we define from the four - point function , an effective coupling constant @xmath9 in the large-@xmath0 limit , which presents different behaviours if the fixed coupling constant @xmath10 in unbounded space is below or above some `` critical '' value @xmath11 . for @xmath12 ( weak coupling )",
    "the model presents small - distance asymptotic freedom , @xmath13 , as @xmath14 . for strong coupling ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "starting from small values of @xmath2 , we analytically demonstrate the simultaneous existence of short distance asymptotic freedom and of a singularity for @xmath2 equal to some @xmath16 , @xmath17 , as @xmath18 .",
    "this means that in the strong coupling regime , if we start with a system of a _ quark - antiquark _ pair bounded between two planes a distance @xmath19 , from one another it would not be possible to separate them a distance larger than @xmath5 .",
    "this spatial confinement of the _ quark - antiquark _ pair could be interpreted as the existence of bound states , characteristic of the model in the strong coupling regime .",
    "we will refer later to this property of the model as _ confinement _ , understood as the spatial confinement described above , _ not _ of colour confinement as it should happpens for qcd .",
    "an interesting point is that the confining length obtained is comparable with an estimated classical proton diameter .    although perturbatively non renormalizable for dimensions @xmath20 , the massive gross - neveu model in tridimensional space has been shown to exist and has been constructed in ref .",
    "the idea that perturbative renormalizability should not be an absolute criterion to a model to be physically consistent comes from works done more than one decade ago .",
    "the results in renormalization theory reported in refs .",
    "@xcite give a theoretical foundation to support the idea that non perturbatively renormalizable models can exist and have a physical meaning @xcite .",
    "in fact , the gross - neveu model for dimensions greater than @xmath21 has been investigated since the middle of the seventies .",
    "since then we know that the difficulties related to the perturbative non - renormalizability of the model can be surmounted , at least for @xmath22 , by performing partial summations in the bare perturbation series , while maintaining its initial structure ( see refs .",
    "this point has been also studied in ref .",
    "the essence of the method lies in the fact that the model in three dimensions may acquire a naive power counting behavior of a just renormalizable theory , if we perform a partial summation , to all orders in the coupling constant , of the chains of one - loop bubbles before trying to renormalize the perturbation series directly .    in present work",
    ", we perform such a summation for the large-@xmath0 model and we renormalize it employing a modified minimal subtraction scheme , where the coupling constant counter - term is a pole at the physical value of the argument of generalized epstein @xmath23-functions @xcite .",
    "this technique , which employs analytic and @xmath23-function regularizations , has been recently used to study the boundary dependence of the coupling constant and the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the compactified @xmath24 model @xcite .",
    "we start from the wick - ordered massive gross - neveu lagrangian in euclidian metrics ( in relativistic units , @xmath25 ) , @xmath26^{2 } : , \\label{gn}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the mass , @xmath27 the coupling constant and @xmath28 is a point of @xmath29 .",
    "the fermionic field of spin @xmath30 has @xmath0 components , @xmath31 @xmath32 , and summation over flavor and spin indices are understood . for a finite number of flavors @xmath0 , for @xmath33 , a",
    "throughout study has been done in ref .",

    "we consider the limit @xmath34 , which permits considerable simplifications .    in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite a theorem has been proved stating that a family of parameters can be exhibited such that , for @xmath0 sufficiently large , all renormalized schwinger functions of the type @xmath35 , p=1,2 , ... exist .",
    "thus we examine in the following the large-@xmath0 zero external - momenta four - point function , which is the basic object for our definition of the renormalized coupling constant .",
    "the four - point function at leading order in @xmath36 is given by the sum of all chains of single one - loop diagrams .",
    "this sum gives for the four - point function at zero external momenta the formal expression @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the feynman integral corresponding to the single one - loop four - point subdiagram @xmath39 notice that @xmath40 has dimension of @xmath41 and the coupling constant @xmath27 has dimension of @xmath42 .",
    "we consider the system bounded between two parallel planes , normal to the @xmath28 -axis , a distance @xmath2 apart from one another .",
    "we use cartesian coordinates @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a @xmath45-dimensional vector , with corresponding momenta @xmath46 , @xmath47 being a @xmath45-dimensional vector in momenta space .",
    "in addition , we assume that the field satisfies bag - model boundary conditions @xcite on the planes @xmath48 and @xmath49 . these boundary conditions , constraining the @xmath28-dependence of the field to a segment of length @xmath2 , allow us to proceed with respect to the @xmath28 -coordinate in a manner analogous as it is done in the imaginary - time formalism in field theory .",
    "this extension of the matsubara procedure to describe a model compactified in a space - coordinate has been already used in the case of bosonic fields @xcite .",

    "this value should be compared with an estimated classical proton diameter , @xmath126 @xcite ; notice that this value is about @xmath127 times larger than the experimentally measured proton charge radius @xcite .",
    "under the assumption that the large-@xmath0 gross - neveu model can be thought about as a model sharing some of the properties of physically meaningful theories ( in the sense of experimentally testable ) , we can say that we have exhibited in a direct way the properties of ultraviolet asymptotic freedom and confinement , characteristics of strong interactions .",
    "this could be contrasted with the fact that in @xmath128 , although asymptotic freedom is a well established property on theoretical grounds , confinement has been confirmed only by computer simulations in lattice field theory .",

    "finally , we would like to point out that the behavior described in this work should not be heavily dependent on the confining geometry .",
    "one expects to have ultraviolet asymptotic freedom in any case and partial or absolute confinement , depending on the value of @xmath10 .",
