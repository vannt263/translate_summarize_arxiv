    "in the last decade , large area surveys like sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ; @xcite ) , have provided high quality data contributing significantly to our understanding of galaxy properties and scaling relations .",
    "nevertheless , galaxy formation remains one of the outstanding questions of modern astrophysics . as the most massive stellar systems in the nearby universe , early - type galaxies ( etgs ) have a special role in providing the underpinnings for a consistent galaxy formation picture .",
    "they form a relatively homogeneous class of objects , dominated by an old stellar population , a small fraction of cold gas and low - levels of ongoing star formation ( sf ) .",
    "these characteristics make them a potentially powerful tool to trace the evolution of cosmic structures back through the cosmic epochs .",
    "the uniformity in the etg properties involves tight correlations of quantities like effective radius , , surface brightness measured within this radius , and central velocity dispersion , @xmath9 , which merge into the so - called fundamental plane ( fp ; @xcite ) .",
    "an observed deviation between the fp coefficients and those expected from the virial theorem has been interpreted , among other possibilities , as a variation of the total with galaxy luminosity / mass ( @xcite ) which in turn may reflect the dm content of an etg ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* t+09 ) ; @xcite ) . therefore",
    ", measuring the dm content in an independent way is of paramount importance for studying the etg scaling relations as well as the overall process of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "recently , the dm content in the central regions of etgs ( typically within @xmath10 ) has been analyzed using both local samples ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; t+09 ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nrt10 ) ) and intermediate - redshift gravitational lens galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t+10 ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "independent of the model used to describe the mass distribution in a galaxy , several studies have found that dm fractions within   increase with galaxy luminosity , stellar mass , size , and velocity dispersion ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; t+09 ; nrt10 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; t+10 ) , while a different conclusion was drawn by  @xcite , based on a constant-  mass model ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation of dm density with stellar mass and points to dm profiles being cuspy ( @xcite ; t+09 ; nrt10 ; t+10 ) .",
    "however , even in this case , inconsistent findings have been reported . using rotation curves of spiral galaxies , and mass models of individual dwarf and spiral galaxies , as well as the weak lensing signal of ellipticals and spirals",
    ", @xcite and @xcite found that the central dm column density is constant over twelve orders of magnitude in luminosity . on the contrary",
    ", nrt10 showed that , on average , the projected central density of nearby etgs is systematically higher than that of spiral and dwarf galaxies , implying an increase of dm density with halo mass . the same conclusion was reached by @xcite , using data for different galaxy types and groups / clusters of galaxies .",
    "part of the above controversies may be associated with sample selection issues , with differences in the way galaxy parameters are measured , as well as with different assumptions about the halo models , imf , and adopted fiducial radius  @xcite . in this paper , we study how the central dm content of etgs correlates with galaxy properties , for a large and homogeneous sample with a wealth of photometric and spectroscopic data available ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i of the series ) . in previous papers",
    ", we analyzed the fp relation of etgs and its dependence on galaxy environment ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper iii ) ) ; and the correlation of internal colour gradients of etgs with galaxy properties ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper iv ) ) . here",
    ", we investigate the dm content of etgs in terms of both structural parameters and various mass proxies , contrasting the average trends with predictions of toy - models and cosmological simulations .",
    "we show , for the first time , how the correlations between the dm content and galaxy properties depend on the environment where these systems reside .",
    "our study resembles previous ones in its use of sdss data to study the connections between stellar and dynamical mass @xcite , but goes beyond these by incorporating additional photometric data as well as environmental information , and may be considered the definitive study of the central dm content of a large sample of bright etgs in the sdss era .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : sample ]",
    "we describe the sample and the data analysis as well as stellar and dynamical mass calculations . in section [ sec : dm ] , central dm fraction and density are analyzed as a function of galaxy mass and structural parameters . in section [ sec : dm_plane ]",
    "we discuss the main drivers of the dm content and the `` dm plane '' of etgs , and in section [ sec : fp_tilt ] the implications for the fp are discussed .",
    "section [ sec : dm_env ] deals with galaxy environment , while section [ sec : dm_models ] compares the correlations involving dm content with expectations from cosmological and toy - galaxy models .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt @xmath11 .",
    "a volume - limited sample of @xmath12 `` bright '' ( @xmath13 ) etgs , in the redshift range of @xmath14 to @xmath15 , with available @xmath16 photometry and optical spectroscopy from sdss - dr6 is used in this work and in previous papers of the spider ( spheroid s panchromatic investigation in different environmental regimes ) project . @xmath17",
    "galaxies also have @xmath18 photometry from dr2 of ukidss - las ( see paper i ) .",
    "etgs are defined as bulge dominated systems , with passive spectra in their centres ( i.e. within the sdss fibre apertures ) . following @xcite , from an operational viewpoint ,",
    "etgs are those systems with eclass @xmath19 and fracdevr @xmath20 , where the sdss spectroscopic parameter eclass gives the spectral type of a galaxy , while the sdss photometric parameter fracdevr measures the fraction of galaxy light that is better fitted by a de vaucouleurs ( rather than an exponential ) law - band axis - ratio @xmath21 . with this alternative cut that minimizes the fraction of s0s",

    "all galaxies have central velocity dispersion , @xmath22 , from sdss - dr6 , in the range of @xmath23 to @xmath24  km  s@xmath25 . in all wavebands , galaxy structural parameters ",
    "i.e. the effective radius , , the mean surface brightness within that radius , @xmath26 , and the srsic index , @xmath5    have been homogeneously measured using 2dphot  @xcite , fitting galaxy images with seeing convolved two - dimensional srsic models .",
    "the spider sample is @xmath27 complete at @xmath28 , or , at a stellar mass @xmath29 for a @xcite imf .    for the present study , we select spider etgs with high quality structural parameters in the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) wavebands , according to the following criteria : the srsic fit has @xmath30 in all wavebands ; uncertainty on @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33  dex from @xmath34 through @xmath4 ( see paper iv for details on these thresholds ) ; available stellar mass estimates ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper v ) ) .",
    "the resulting sample consists of @xmath35 etgs .",
    "as expected , all these galaxies reside on the red - sequence , with more than @xmath36 having @xmath37 ( within an aperture of 1  ) , and a median @xmath38 . for this sample , the spans the range @xmath39 ( @xmath40 for more than @xmath41 of the galaxies ) , with a median of @xmath42 . the median ratio between the sdss fibre aperture , where velocity dispersions are measured , and the @xmath4-band effective radius , @xmath43 , amounts to @xmath44 , implying only a little `` extrapolation '' in our dm fraction estimates ( see sec .  [ sec : dmasses ] ) .",
    "as shown in paper i , significant differences are found when comparing 2dphot and sdss structural parameters .",
    "such differences arise from the use of srsic ( 2dphot ) rather than de vaucouleurs ( sdss ) models to fit the light and total mass distribution of etgs ; from different software to measure the structural parameters ; and from the sky estimation bias that affects sdss photometry  @xcite . in appendix",
    "a , we further illustrate this point by comparing correlations among structural parameters from different sources .",
    "the environment of etgs in the spider sample is characterized by a friends - of - friends catalog of @xmath45 groups , created as in @xcite . here , we used berlind s algorithm over a larger area , as the new sdss - dr7 is now available ( rather than dr3 ; see paper iii for details ) .",
    "a shifting gapper technique is applied to this catalogue ( see  @xcite ) , allowing galaxies to be classified as either group members ( @xmath46 ) , non - group members ( hereafter `` field '' galaxies ; @xmath47 ) , or unclassified ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we also separate group members into central and satellite galaxies , where the central galaxy of a given group is the object with the largest stellar mass  @xcite .",
    "stellar masses are derived by fitting synthetic stellar population ( sp ) models from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bc03 hereafter ) to the optical+nir photometry , using the software _ lephare _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed galaxy fluxes determine the normalization of the best - fit template , which then gives the stellar mass ,  ( initially computed within the sdss kron aperture , which we correct using srsic models to total mass ) .",
    "we adopt a set of sp models with different star - formation @xmath49-folding times ( @xmath50  gyr ) , internal reddenings ( @xmath51 ) , and metallicities ( @xmath52 ) , assuming a @xcite extinction law and chabrier imf .",
    "we refer the reader to paper v for all details about the fitting procedure and the accuracy of stellar mass estimates using different theoretical and empirical assumptions .",
    "we provide here only a summary of statistical and systematic uncertainties on stellar mass estimates . in paper",
    "v , we compared stellar mass estimates obtained with different stellar population models , e.g. bc03 and pegase.2 models  @xcite , different internal extinction laws , and different combinations of wavebands adopted in the sed fitting procedure . also , we performed comparisons with spectroscopically derived stellar masses ( the two sets of estimates being in excellent agreement , with a median difference of @xmath53 ) .",
    "in general , the comparison of different sets of stellar mass estimates shows that the scatter in   ( i.e. its uncertainty ) ranges from @xmath14 to @xmath54  dex . as in other studies ( see paper v and references therein ) systematic uncertainties on stellar mass were found to play a major role , with variations in the imf and extinction law yielding systematic biases on the mass of nearly a factor of 2 .",
    "notice though , that despite the age - metallicity degeneracies in photometric data , these conspire to keep the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( and hence the stellar masses ) relatively well constrained .",
    "a de - projected srsic law in the @xmath4-band is used to describe the density profile of the stellar component .      the dynamical mass within a given galaxy radius , @xmath55 , is usually computed as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the gravitational constant , @xmath22 is the galaxy velocity dispersion , and @xmath4 is a pressure correction term ( e.g. @xcite ; t+09 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 depends on several factors , like the radius wherein is computed , the aperture used to measure @xmath22 , the viewing angle of the system , its orbital structure , luminosity profile , and how dm is distributed . here , we follow the approach used in t+09 , where instead of adopting some approximation for @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_virial ] ) , we model each individual galaxy directly using the jeans equations to estimate  within @xmath58  1   ( see also @xcite ; t+10 ) .",
    "the models also require assumptions about the mass profile in order to extrapolate to  from the more central ( on average ) @xmath22 measurements . here",
    "our approach is to adopt two types of mass profile that bracket a range of possibilities .",
    "each of these describes the total mass profile with one free parameter :    * _ sis . _ the singular isothermal sphere , where @xmath59 , is the prototype of a galaxy profile producing a flat rotation curve . despite its simplicity , this reproduces quite well the total mass profile in the most massive etgs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and in particular the massive halo present in their outer regions , consistently with virial mass estimates ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . since a galaxy halo is expected to be truncated when it enters a group / cluster of galaxies , we analyze the impact of the environment on the central dm fractions using also a truncated sis model ( ) , where the density profile is truncated at a radius @xmath60 . for each of the group etgs ,",
    "the value of @xmath61 is computed from the projected distance between the etg and the centre of the parent group , following the recipes of @xcite . *",
    "_ constant .",
    "_ some studies of ordinary etgs suggest that the mass profile falls off roughly as steeply as the stars , at small to intermediate radii , which may imply either little dm in their centres or dm profiles that mimic the stars @xcite .",
    "the mass profile is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the typical mass - to - light ratio of the system and @xmath64 is the luminosity profile , modeled here by the @xcite law .",
    "hence , the mass distribution is assumed to follow the profile of the stellar component , whose shape ( i.e. the srsic @xmath5 ) , changes from galaxy to galaxy , reflecting the structural non - homology of the light profiles of etgs .",
    "operationally , for each galaxy , given a mass profile model , we compute the projected mass - weighted velocity dispersion of the model , @xmath65 , within the sdss fibre aperture . the @xmath65 is then matched to the observed central velocity dispersion of the galaxy , providing the corresponding best - fit parameter , @xmath66 ( @xmath63 ) for the  ( ) model , and the mass profile @xmath67 ( see appendix [ sec : jeans_procedure ] for details ) .",
    "we characterize the dm content of an etg by computing ( i ) the de - projected dm fraction , @xmath68 or the total - to - stellar mass ratio @xmath69 , where and are the stellar and dynamical mass   within a given de - projected radius , @xmath55 ; and ( ii ) the de - projected average dm density , @xmath70 , giving more direct information on the dm content of a galaxy .",
    "the @xmath71 is estimated by de - projecting the @xmath4-band light profile of each galaxy ( assuming spherical symmetry ) , and normalizing this de - projected profile to the total estimate , from paper v. hereafter , we refer to @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , i.e. the dm fraction ( density ) computed within a de - projected radius equal to the projected @xmath74 , as the `` central '' dm fraction ( density ) .",
    "to provide a more straightforward way of estimating  from velocity dispersion and effective radius ( as done in previous work ) , and of comparing mass estimates from different models , we also recast the computation of dynamical masses in terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_virial ] ) . for each galaxy , we correct the observed @xmath22 to an aperture of 1  , @xmath75 , following  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . then , we insert , @xmath75 , and the dynamical mass estimates obtained through the jeans equations ( see above ) into eq .",

    "detailed dynamical modeling efforts of etgs have focused extensively on their central regions ( i.e. those we investigate in this work ) , and found anisotropies to be fairly mild in general , typically in the range @xmath97 @xcite , where @xmath98 quantifies the relative internal dispersions in the tangential and radial directions .",

    "this means that dm content variation might be able by itself to explain the entire fraction of the tilt which is not due to stellar population effects ( i.e. a variation of age and/or metallicity with mass ) .",
    "we also notice that , in the context of the   model , the variation of dm content with mass is flatter than with the  model , which would lead one to conclude that both non - homology and a change of dm content contribute to the tilt ( see t+09 for details ) .",
    "last , but not least , one should notice that connecting the slope of the @xmath155 vs. @xmath128 relation to the tilt of the fp is not trivial .",

    "thus , the above conclusion about the origin of the tilt remains uncertain . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of a central  dm plane is a robust result ( see previous section ) , and may be explained by the dm halos of etgs being only approximately universal .",

    ", we do not find any significant environmental variation of the correlations between central dm content and structural parameters and mass of etgs .",
    "this result can be discussed in light of what we found in paper iii , i.e. that the tilt of the fp is larger for group , relative to field , etgs . since we found this effect to be independent of the waveband where galaxy structural parameters are measured ( from @xmath34 through @xmath4 ) , we concluded that it is explained by some `` wavelength - independent '' effect , like a different variation of dm content with mass for group ( relative to field ) etgs .",
    "this latter conclusion seems to contrast with what we have found here ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_env ] ) .",
    "however , as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : dm_plane ] , in the present study we analyze central dm fractions , while the tilt of the fp may be more related to the behavior of global quantities .",

    "such conclusions will depend on the modelling ingredients , such as the imf adopted , the  vs  relation etc . , which it is outside the scope of this paper to examine in detail . here",

    "structural parameters of etgs , such as the effective radius , , are known to be significantly affected by the method ( e.g. 1d vs. 2d fitting of the light distribution ) and profile shape ( e.g. de vaucouleurs vs. srsic law ) used to derive them  ( e.g. @xcite ) . while such differences do not affect the fp relation of etgs , because of the correlated variation of  and the mean surface brightness therein , @xmath266 , they can affect other correlations among structural parameters and luminosity ( mass ) , and hence the correlations with dm fractions ( densities ) .",
    "for instance , in sec .",
    "[ sec : dm_fraction ] we have shown that the  correlations presented in the present study are somewhat steeper than those we previously derived in t+09 , based on a different sample of etgs , from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ps96 ) .",
    "we address this issue in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , where we compare our @xmath34-band luminosity  size relation to that of the ps96 @xmath267-band sample analyzed by t+09 . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "in the same plot we include our @xmath34-band srsic index ",
    "size relation , and compare both relations to the @xmath34-band data from  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "notice that the effective parameters of the ps96 sample are based on de voucouleurs ( rather than srsic ) galaxy profile fits , hence no comparison to our srsic @xmath5size relation is possible .",
    "we refer the reader to previous papers of the series ( papers i , ii ) for a detailed comparison of correlations among structural parameters from the spider survey and sdss pipeline .",
    "the present sample of etgs exhibits a steeper luminosity  size relation than that of the t+09 sample .",
    "this is explained by the fact that fitting a high-@xmath5 galaxy with a de vaucouleurs profile gives a systematically smaller  value , hence flattening the luminosity  size relation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , this explains why our relation is steeper than that of t+09 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_fdm_comparison ] ) , as a smaller  encloses a smaller portion of the dm halo ( implying lower  estimates ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlations among structural parameters for the present sample are in better agreement with those of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we remark that since significant differences in the   correlations exist when analyzing different samples of etgs ( i.e. different sets of structural parameters ) , it is of paramount importance to compare different samples of galaxies ( e.g. different environments ) based on a homogeneous set of measurements , as the one used here .",
    "our basic approach to estimating the dm content of etgs is the same as in t+09 . for each galaxy ,",
    "we first de - project the corresponding  @xcite light profile , assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "this gives the de - projected luminosity profile , @xmath268 , where @xmath55 is the spatial distance to the centre of the galaxy .",
    "using a srsic model here has the main advantage of taking into account the non - homology of the stellar matter distribution of etgs ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "we also assume some simplified functional form for the dynamical mass profile , @xmath269 , i.e. either a  profile , @xmath270 , or a sis model , where @xmath271 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sample ] ) . assuming spherical symmetry and no rotation , we write the jeans equation as : @xmath272 where @xmath273 is the anisotropy . under the hypothesis of isotropy ( i.e. , @xmath274 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : jeans ] ) simplifies to @xmath275 in order to fit the given mass to the data , we project this equation in 2d , obtaining the line - of - sight velocity dispersion : @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the projected surface brightness profile .",
    "we integrate @xmath278 within a fixed aperture @xmath279 ( i.e. the sdss fibre aperture ) to obtain the aperture velocity dispersion , @xmath280 : @xmath281 where @xmath282 is the luminosity within the projected radius @xmath283 . to avoid lengthy calculations ,",
    "we have adopted the compact formulae for @xmath280 calculated in @xcite and @xcite ( see @xcite for the anisotropic case ) .",
    "finally , we fit the model @xmath284 to the observed @xmath285 , by varying the free parameters in eq .",
