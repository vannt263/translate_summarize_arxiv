    "recently , the besiii collaboration reported the observation of a new charged charmonium - like state in the @xmath6 channel in @xmath7 decay @xcite . its mass and width are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . soon afterwards , the belle @xcite and cleo @xcite collaborations confirmed the existence of this hadronic structure .",
    "notice that this new resonance , nominated as @xmath2 , is a charged charmonium - like state ; therefore , it certainly contains at least four quarks , a pair of charm quarks and two light quarks .",
    "it is an exotic state . in the b - quark sector , recall that two bottom - like charged sates @xmath5 and @xmath10 were observed by the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "that implies that there exist similar structures in the charm and bottom energy regions .",
    "these new findings reflect the renaissance of the study of the so - called exotic states .    in the literature ,",
    "various models have been proposed to interpret the new experimental observations . for @xmath2 , for instance , models of the molecular state @xcite , the tetraquark state @xcite , the initial single pion emission ( ispe ) scheme @xcite and so on were proposed . for a comprehensive review of the theoretical status of this state ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref.@xcite .",
    "since a definite conclusion has not yet been reached , more efforts are still necessary to explore its inner structure .",
    "the method of qcd sum rules @xcite has been applied successfully to many hadronic phenomena , such as the hadron spectrum and hadron decays . in this approach , an interpolating current with proper quantum numbers",
    "are constructed corresponding to a hadron of interest .",
    "then , by constructing a correlation function and matching its operator product expansion ( ope ) to its hadronic saturation , the main function for extracting the mass or decay rate of the hadron is established . in the original paper on the quark model @xcite ,",
    "gell - mann discussed the possibility of the existence of free diquarks .",
    "the concept of diquark is based on the fundamental theory , and has been invoked to interpret a number of phenomena observed in experiment @xcite . in ref.@xcite , the exotic state x(3872 ) was explored through the qcd sum rules , where the hadronic state was considered as a hidden charm tetraquark state with quantum number @xmath11 ( hcts ) . employing the same interpolating current , chen and zhu investigated the @xmath12 tetraquark state and found its mass to be @xmath13 @xcite .    in this paper , we calculate the mass of the hidden charm tetraquark state with @xmath14 ( hctv ) by using the qcd sum rules , and confront it with the @xmath2 . here , the hctv is interpreted as the isospin 1 partner of the hcts . comparing this work with ref.@xcite ,",
    "two differences are noteworthy .",
    "first , the interpolating current here is different from the hcts current .",
    "second , of the hctv , as mentioned in ref.@xcite , the higher - dimensional two - gluon and mixed condensates are not negligible in order to obtain a reasonable sum rule . hence , in this work , the non - perturbative condensates up to dimension eight are taken into account .",
    "in addition , different from refs.@xcite on hctv , in our analysis the quark - gluon condensate term in the light - quark  full \" propagator is considered , and a moderate criterion is adopted in finding the available threshold parameter @xmath15 and the borel window @xmath16 .",
    "the starting point of the qcd sum rules is the two - point correlation function constructed from the interpolating current : @xmath17    the interpolating current of the hctv is expressed as @xcite : @xmath18 \\ ; , \\label{current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , are color indices , and @xmath23 represents the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "note that there is a minus sign difference between the current given in eq.([current ] ) and the one in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , even under the su(2 ) symmetry the mass obtained for the hctv differs from the hcts , which is what is to be analyzed in the following .",
    "generally , the two - point correlation function takes the following lorentz covariance form : @xmath24 because the axial vector current is not conserved , there are two independent parts appearing in the correlation function , i.e. @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where the subscripts 1 and 0 denote the quantum numbers of the spin 1 and 0 , respectively .    on the phenomenological side , after separating the ground state contribution from the pole term in @xmath25 , the correlation function",
    "is expressed as a dispersion integral over a physical regime , i.e. , @xmath27 here , @xmath28 represents the hctv mass , @xmath29 is the spectral density representing the contributions of higher excited and continuum states , @xmath30 denotes the threshold of higher excited and continuum states , and @xmath31 stands for the pole residue , representing the coupling strength defined by @xmath32 .    on the ope side of @xmath25 , the correlation function can be expressed as a dispersion relation : @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is given by the imaginary part of the correlation function , @xmath35/{\\pi } $ ] and it can be written as @xmath36 where  @xmath22 \" stands for other higher dimension condensates neglected in this work . @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath38 denote those contributions of the correlation function which have no imaginary parts but have nontrivial values under the borel transform . after making the borel",
    "transform on the ope side , we get @xmath39    to evaluate the spectral density , the  full \" propagators @xmath40 and @xmath41 for light ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) and heavy quarks ( @xmath45 or @xmath20 ) are necessary , in which the vacuum condensates are explicitly shown @xcite , i.e. , @xmath46 + \\frac{i}{12 } g_s^2 \\delta_{i j } g^a_{\\alpha \\beta } g^a_{\\alpha \\beta } m_q \\frac{p^2 + m_q \\hat{p}}{(p^2 - m_q^2)^4 } \\nonumber \\\\ \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! & + & \\ ! \\ ! \\",

    "in performing the numerical evaluation , the values of the input parameters , the condensates , and the quark masses are adopted as follows @xcite : @xmath68 here , the scale dependence of these parameters is not taken into account since our calculation is performed at the leading order in @xmath51 .",

    "@xcite by virtue of the qcd sum rules and hence they are defined in the @xmath69-scheme . for more details of the nature of the inputs , one may refer to ref.@xcite .",
    "in the approach of qcd sum rules , choosing a proper threshold @xmath30 and borel parameter @xmath16 are critical to obtain a reasonable result .",
    "there are two criteria in making such choices @xcite .",
    "first , the convergence of the ope should be kept .",
    "to this aim , one may compare the relative contribution of each term in eqs.([rhopert ] ) to ( [ eq19 ] ) with the total contribution on the ope side , which are shown in fig.[opeconvergence ] . from the figure",
    ", we notice that a quite good ope convergence occurs when @xmath70 , and then we fix the lower working limit for @xmath16 .     at @xmath71 .",
    "the solid line denotes the fraction of the perturbative contribution , and each subsequent line denotes the addition of one extra condensate dimension in the expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath72 ( short - dashed line ) , @xmath73 ( dotted line ) , @xmath74 ( dotted - dashed line ) , and @xmath75 ( long - dashed line),width=283 ]    the second criterion to constrain the @xmath16 is that the pole contribution should be larger than the continuum contribution .",
    "that means we need to evaluate the relative pole contribution ( pc ) to the total , the pole plus continuum , for various values of @xmath16 . to eliminate the contributions from the higher excited and continuum states properly ,",
    "we ask the pole contribution to be larger than @xmath76 @xcite , which is a little different from the constraint in @xcite . the relative weight is presented in fig.[polecontribution ] , which tells the upper limit for @xmath16 .",
    "we note that the upper constraint on @xmath16 depends on the threshold value @xmath30 .",
    "so , for different @xmath30 , we will find different upper bounds for @xmath16 . to determine the proper value of @xmath30",
    ", we carry out a similar analysis to ref.@xcite , and find that the optimal value of @xmath30 obtained there is also suitable in our case .",
    "the reason is that the dominant contributions of the ope side are the same in this work and ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , for the proper @xmath30 in our analysis , @xmath77 , we find @xmath78 .    .",
    "the solid line represents the relative pole contribution , and the dashed line corresponds to the relative continuum contribution , width=283 ]    since the interpolating current in eq.([current ] ) is different from what in ref.@xcite , the ope contributions in this work and in the hcts analysis must be different . to highlight the contributions of the new high - dimensional condensates in the hctv , in table.[ratio ] we present the relative ratios of the additional terms to the existing terms in ref.@xcite for each involved condensate at @xmath77 . among these ratios in table.[ratio ] , we find that the additional contributions of dimension - four and -eight condensates are considerable for the hctv , which is different from the case in ref.@xcite . that is to say , the inclusion of high - dimensional condensates is necessary in obtaining a precise and reliable mass of the hctv .",
    "fig.[mass ] shows the dependence of @xmath28 on the borel parameter @xmath16 , where lines from bottom to top correspond to the continuum threshold @xmath15 being @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , respectively .",

    "on the borel parameter @xmath16 , where the three lines from bottom to top correspond to the continuum threshold @xmath15 being @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , respectively , width=283 ]",
    "in the approach of qcd sum rules , hadrons are represented by their interpolating quark currents taken with large virtualities . in this work , in order to extract the mass of the hctv , we have constructed the proper interpolating current with the quantum numbers of @xmath14 , which coincide with the newly observed charged charmonium - like resonance @xmath2 .    in our calculation , the non - perturbative qcd contributions up to dimension eight in the ope are taken into account .",
    "we find that the @xmath87 hidden charm tetraquark state lies in around 3900 mev , i.e. @xmath88 , which hence presumably will turn out to be the newly observed charmonium - like resonance @xmath2 .",
    "comparing to a similar work of ref.@xcite , where the mass of the hidden charm @xmath12 tetraquark state with the same interpolating current under the isospin symmetry was evaluated , we add a new mixed condensate term in the light - quark propagator , which affects the contributions of the dimension five and dimension eight in the ope . moreover , in order to highlight the contribution of the ground state in eq.([spectraldensity ] ) , in our analysis two constraint criteria are employed .",
    "we straightforwardly extend our analysis to the b - quark sector . with the same quantum numbers ,",
    "the mass of the hidden bottom tetraquark state @xmath89[\\bar{b}\\bar{d}]$ ] is obtained , i.e. @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this state has been investigated via qcd sum rules in ref.@xcite , where only the operators up to dimension six in ope were considered and hence the result is somehow different from ours . in our analysis , operators of dimension eight are also taken into account .",
    "our calculational result , within uncertainties , strongly supports the tetraquark picture of the state @xmath5 observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that in order to make a more solid prediction for the multiquark states in qcd sum rules , the radiative correction and the energy - scale dependence on quark masses and condensates in the calculation should be taken into account , which are mostly missing in present - day investigations .                                                                for a review and references to original works , see e.g. , s. narison , _ qcd as a theory of hadrons , cambridge monogr .",
