    "the ability to tune the @xmath1-wave scattering length to large positive and negative values , or even to zero , has opened the possibility to systematically map out the system behavior from the non - interacting regime to the weakly - attractive ( weakly - repulsive ) regime to the strongly - attractive ( strongly - repulsive ) regime  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the de broglie wave length is , in the ultracold regime , much larger than the van der waals length of atom - atom interactions justifies important simplifications in the theoretical treatment of cold atom gases .",
    "specifically , the true atom - atom potential , which typically supports many two - body bound states , can be replaced by a simple model potential such as a zero - range pseudo - potential or a gaussian potential , which supports at most a few two - body bound states . if the free - space scattering length of the model potential agrees with that of the true atom - atom potential , then theoretical treatments that utilize a model potential are , in general , expected to describe the low - energy physics with good accuracy .",

    "the identical fermions interact through a simple two - body model potential with @xmath1-wave scattering length @xmath2 with the third distinguishable particle . since the scattering between the identical fermions is , away from a @xmath8-wave resonance or higher partial wave resonances , suppressed by the wigner threshold law , we assume that the identical fermions do not interact .",
    "we determine the bound state properties of this three - body system as functions of the interspecies @xmath1-wave scattering length @xmath2 and the mass ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath9 ; we consider the regime @xmath10 . the bound state properties of fermionic three - body systems with unequal masses have previously been investigated in mixed dimensions  @xcite . while atomic three - body systems in free space share many characteristics with the low - energy properties of few - nucleon systems  @xcite , three - atom systems in a harmonic waveguide with cylindrical symmetry have no direct nuclear analog . if transverse excitations are absent ( i.e. , if @xmath4 ) and if the size of the three - body bound state is much larger than the harmonic oscillator length @xmath11 that characterizes the confinement in the transverse direction , then a strictly one - dimensional hamiltonian with appropriately chosen one - dimensional coupling constant provides a qualitatively correct description  @xcite . however , when the size of the three - body bound state becomes comparable to or smaller than @xmath11 , then the trimer `` feels '' the full three - dimensional space and we find , in agreement with what might be expected naively , that a simple effective one - dimensional hamiltonian provides a poor description .",

    "indeed , this is the case for mass ratios not much larger than one . for sufficiently large @xmath0 and positive @xmath1-wave scattering length , however , the attraction is sufficiently large to `` outweigh '' the energy increase due to the projection quantum number @xmath12 being finite .",
    "the existence of three - body bound states on the positive @xmath1-wave scattering length side is related to the fact that the three - body system in free space , i.e. , in the absence of the waveguide , supports universal bound states with finite angular momentum if @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite .",
