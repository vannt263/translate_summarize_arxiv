    "cluster - tilted algebras were introduced by buan , marsh and reiten @xcite and , independently in @xcite for type @xmath0 as a byproduct of the now extensive theory of cluster algebras of fomin and zelevinsky @xcite . since then , cluster - tilted algebras have been the subject of several investigations , see , for instance , @xcite .    in particular , in @xcite",
    "is given a construction procedure for cluster - tilted algebras : let @xmath1 be a triangular algebra of global dimension two over an algebraically closed field @xmath2 , and consider the @xmath1-@xmath1-bimodule @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the standard duality , with its natural left and right @xmath1-actions .",
    "the trivial extension of @xmath1 by this bimodule is called the _ relation - extension _",
    "@xmath5 of @xmath1 .",
    "it is shown there that , if @xmath1 is tilted , then its relation - extension is cluster - tilted , and every cluster - tilted algebra occurs in this way .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to study the relation - extensions of a wider class of triangular algebras of global dimension two , namely the class of quasi - tilted algebras , introduced by happel , reiten and smal   in @xcite . in general , the relation - extension of a quasi - tilted algebra is not cluster - tilted , however it is 2-calabi - yau tilted , see theorem [ thm 2.1 ] below .",
    "we then look more closely at those cluster - tilted algebras which are tame and representation - infinite . according to @xcite ,",
    "these coincide exactly with the cluster - tilted algebras of euclidean type .",
    "we ask then the following question : given a cluster - tilted algebra @xmath6 of euclidean type , find all quasi - tilted algebras @xmath1 such that @xmath7 . a similar question has been asked ( and answered ) in @xcite ,",
    "where , however , @xmath1 was assumed to be tilted .    for this purpose ,",
    "we generalize the notion of reflections of @xcite .",
    "we prove that this operation allows to produce all tilted algebras @xmath1 such that @xmath7 , see theorem [ thm mainreflection ] . in @xcite",
    "this result was shown only for cluster - tilted algebras of tree type .",
    "we also prove that , unlike those of @xcite , reflections in the sense of the present paper are always defined , that the reflection of a tilted algebra is also tilted of the same type , and that they have the same relation - extension , see theorem [ thm reflection ] and proposition [ prop reflection ] below .",
    "because all tilted algebras having a given cluster - tilted algebra as relation - extension are given by iterated reflections , this gives an algorithmic answer to our question above .",
    "after that , we look at the tubes of a cluster - tilted algebra of euclidean type and give a procedure for constructing those tubes which contain a projective , see proposition [ prop5 ] .",
    "we then return to quasi - tilted algebras in our last section , namely we define a particular two - sided ideal of a cluster - tilted algebra , which we call the partition ideal .",
    "our first result ( theorem [ thm ctaqt ] ) shows that the quasi - tilted algebras which are not tilted but have a given cluster - tilted algebra @xmath6 of euclidean type as relation - extension are the quotients of @xmath6 by a partition ideal .",
    "we end the paper with the proof of our main result ( theorem [ thm ctaqt3 ] ) which says that if @xmath1 is quasi - tilted and such that @xmath7 , then either @xmath1 is the quotient of @xmath6 by the annihilator of a local slice ( and then @xmath1 is tilted ) or it is the quotient of @xmath6 by a partition ideal ( and then @xmath1 is not tilted except in two cases easy to characterize ) .",
