    "wireless sensor networks ( wsn ) are known to have a broad range of applications such as environmental monitoring , battle - field surveillance and space exploration @xcite .",
    "a typical wireless sensor network is composed of numerous sensors with each sensor having limited on - board processing and communication capability .",
    "the sensors are usually randomly casted over a large field in space to sense the same physical event . in practice",
    "the sensing observations tend to be disturbed due to the noise from hardware device or environment .",
    "the noisy observations are collected by the fusion centers ( fc ) , where data fusion and further processing will be performed .",
    "the large amount of sensors are usually grouped into clusters , with each cluster formed by sensors located closely within a small neighborhood . within each cluster , a cluser - head(ch ) collects observations from other sensors free of error(this is reasonable since the cluster members lie in close vicinity ) and then transmit the collected data to fc .",
    "assume that hcs and fc are equipped with multiple antennas and linear transceivers , then a central question here is how to jointly design the transceivers to transmit the data reliably .",
    "this falls in the general problem of multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) transceiver(beamforming ) design problem , which has aroused a flurry of interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "we introduce the system model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sysmodel ] to capture the key characteristics of the afore - mentioned practical scenario .",
    "the event of interest @xmath0 is modeled as a complex scalar and sensed by a total of @xmath1 sensors ( cluster - members ) coming from @xmath2 clusters .",
    "these sensors communicate their imperfect sensing results to their respective cluster - heads . within each cluster @xmath3 ,",
    "the observation distortion of the @xmath4 sensors are collectively modeled as an additive noise vector @xmath5 ( of size @xmath4 ) , which may have any distribution ( not necessarily gaussian ) .",
    "the cluster - head @xmath3 performs linear precoding @xmath6 to data before transmission with @xmath7 antennas .",
    "we assume that each cluster - head must conform to an individual transmission power constraint @xmath8 , in accordance to its specific power supply or battery life .",
    "it should be noted that , compared to a single overall power constraint for all the cluster - heads , the set of separate power constraints makes the model not only more practical , but also considerably harder .",
    "the mimo coherent - sum multiple access channel ( mac ) is considered for communications between cluster - heads and fusion center , which achieves a high bandwidth efficiency .",
    "the fading channel between the @xmath3-th cluster - head and the fusion center is denoted as @xmath9 . at the fusion center ,",
    "the received signal is corrupted by additive noise @xmath10 ( of size @xmath11 ) .",
    "the fusion center performs linear postcoding @xmath12 to deduce an estimate @xmath13 .",
    "our goal is to jointly design the transceivers @xmath6 and @xmath14 to achieve a best estimate @xmath0 .",
    "the line of beamforming design in wsn research has actually received significant attention in recent years .",
    "a good variety of system setups have been investigated in the literature @xcite .",
    "compared to these existing literature , our system model is generally more generic and complicated .",
    "for example , @xcite considers the case where each cluster has only one sensor ( i.e. @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and all cluster - heads and fusion center are equipped with one single antenna ( i.e. @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 ) . under the total power constraint over all the cluster - heads ,",
    "the transceiver design problem boils down to a power allocation problem .",
    "@xcite extends the scalar fading channel in @xcite to square nonsingular matrix channels , i.e. @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "still all clusters share one total power constraint .",
    "note that the total power constraint over different clusters are usually nonrealistic since in practice different cluster - heads can be far away from each other without wired connections and are powered separately by build - in batteries .",
    "@xcite extends the research by employing separate power constraints for each cluster - head , but still restricts the channel matrices @xmath9 to be square and nonsingular .",
    "block coordinate descent(bcd ) algorithm is obtained in @xcite to solve the problem .",
    "several studies are particularly noteworthy @xcite .",
    "@xcite is the first to propose a very general wireless sensor network model , where separate power constraints are employed and each fading channel matrix @xmath9 can have arbitrary dimension(@xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) .",
    "@xcite studies solutions to several special but also rather meaningful cases including scalar channels , fading but noiseless channels and nonfading but noisy channels .",
    "@xcite focuses on the scalar target source with nonscalar fading and noisy channels and obtains an approximate bcd algorithm with fully closed form solution for each step .",
    "the work @xcite develop variant bcd algorithms to tackle the most general case proposed in @xcite , with convergence and closed form solutions being examined in @xcite .",
    "all the above works adopt mean square error(mse ) as performance metric .",
    "recently joint transceiver design problems aiming mutual information(mi ) maximization are studied in @xcite , where orthogonal and coherent - sumq mac are considered respectively .",
    "the primary interest of this paper is to solve the joint transceiver design problem for the system depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sysmodel ] .",
    "the previous studies in@xcite all used mse or mi as the design criterion , and many of them assume a single power constraint ( which renders an easier problem than separate power constraints ) . here",
    "we take the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at the output of the fc postcoder @xmath14 as a figure of merit .",
    "the snr is an important performance indicator especially for discrete sources ( where mse becomes less meaningful ) .",
    "maximizing snr is equivalent to maximizing the symbol error rate ( ser ) in the discrete - source detection ; and in the special case of gaussian signaling , maximizing snr is also equivalent to maximizing the channel capacity .",
    "the joint optimization problem is first formulated . since it is non - convex , and",
    "since changing the design criterion ( e.g. snr instead of mse ) leads to a drastically different target function , the previous approaches and results can not be readily applied .",
    "instead , we develop three feasible methods , all of which stem from the celebrated block coordinated ascent ( bca ) principles , but each incorporates different techniques specifically tailored to the problem at hand , and renders computational strength in different scenarios .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the problem is formulated is section [ sec : system model ] .",
    "the optimal linear receiver is obtained in section [ sec : opt_rec ] .",
    "two different realizations of 2-block coordinated ascent ( bca ) algorithm are discussed in section [ sec : opt_all_sensors ] , with their convergence being carefully examined .",
    "section [ sec : multiple_bca ] proposes a multiple - block coordinate ascent approach , which promises tremendous reduction in complexity for special system settings .",
    "extensive simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in section [ sec : numerical results ] and section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the whole paper .",

    "we first discuss of the system model shown in fig.[fig : sysmodel ] and present a mathematical formulation of the optimization problem at hand .",
    "the system is composed of @xmath1 sensors with @xmath4 sensors belonging to the @xmath3th cluster , @xmath2 sensor - heads each equipped with @xmath7 transmitting antennas , and a fusion center equipped with @xmath11 receiving antennas .",
    "all sensors observe a common unknown source @xmath45 , and send their observation to their respective cluster - heads . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume @xmath0 has zero mean and unit variance , i.e. @xmath46 . the sensing noise and transmission noise ( to the @xmath3th cluster - head ) can be collectively modeled as an additive noise @xmath5 , such that the @xmath3th cluster - head observes : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a vector of dimension @xmath49 with all the entries being @xmath50 , and @xmath5 denotes the additive noise vector with zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath51 , where @xmath52 . following the convention of wsn , we assume that @xmath5 s for the different clusters are mutually uncorrelated .",
    "the noisy observation @xmath53 is beamformed by a linear precoder @xmath54 at each cluster - head before being sent to the fusion center .",
    "let @xmath55 be the mimo channel state information ( csi ) from the @xmath3th cluster - head to the fusion center .",
    "suppose all the cluster - heads form a coherent - sum mac channel ; then the fusion center receives signal @xmath56 : @xmath57 where @xmath10 is the additive noise at the fusion center . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath10 has zero mean and white covariance matrix : @xmath58 . since the fusion center is usually far away from the sensing field , @xmath10 is assumed uncorrelated with @xmath5 s .",
    "in practice , it is highly likely that each cluster - head is provisioned with a different power supply and hence must observe a different transmission power constraint .",
    "the average transmission power for the @xmath3-th cluster - head is @xmath59 , which must be no greater than a power limit @xmath8 .",
    "the fusion center uses a linear postcoder @xmath14 to perform data fusion and obtain an estimate @xmath13 : @xmath60    the merit of the recovered signal @xmath13 can be evaluated from several different perspectives .",
    "when the source @xmath0 takes value from a continuous space , the most popular metric is the mean square error , defined as @xmath61 .",
    "mse - targeted optimization has also been extensively studied in the beamforming literature ( e.g. @xcite ) . instead of taking mse , here we target the average snr , another important",
    "metric widely used in the design of communication systems . when the source @xmath0 is taken from from a finite discrete alphabet set ( e.g. @xmath11-pam or @xmath11-qam ) , the detection accuracy is usually measured by the symbol error probability taking the form of @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 being some positive constants .",
    "when the source @xmath0 has gaussian distribution , the system throughput is usually measured by the mutual information between @xmath0 and its estimate @xmath13 , @xmath65 .",
    "hence , maximizing the snr automatically minimizes the ser ( for discrete source ) or maximizes the mutual information ( for gaussian source ) .    from ( [ eq : received_theta ] ) , the signal obtained by the fusion center ( after linear postcoder @xmath14 ) is composed of a signal component and a noise component , and the average snr can be calculated and simplified to @xmath66\\big[\\sum_{j=1}^l\\mathbf{h}_j\\mathbf{f}_j\\mathbf{1}_{k_j}\\big]^h\\mathbf{g}}{\\sigma_0 ^ 2\\|\\mathbf{g}\\|^2_2+\\sum_{i=1}^{l}\\mathbf{g}^h\\mathbf{h}_i\\mathbf{f}_i\\mathbf{\\sigma}_i\\mathbf{f}_i^h\\mathbf{h}_i^h\\mathbf{g}},\\label{eq : snr_func}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the assumption of uncorrelated noise across the fusion center and different cluster - heads has been invoked .",
    "hence , the joint transceiver design problem maximizing snr for the clustered wireless sensor network can be formulated as    [ eq : original_snr_prob ] @xmath67    the optimization problem ( @xmath68 ) is nonconvex , as can be easily examined by checking the special case of scalar transceivers . in",
    "what follows , we will exploit the general principle of block coordinate ascent method to solve ( @xmath68 ) in an iterative manner .",
    "in this section , we present the optimal linear receiver @xmath14 which leads to the maximal snr .",
    "the main result is as follows :    [ thm : opt_g ] for any predefined @xmath69 , snr is maximized if and only if @xmath70 has the following form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is arbitrary nonzero complex scalar .",
    "the maximal snr is given as @xmath73    for simplicity we introduce the following notations    @xmath74    with all sensors beamformers @xmath75 given , the snr maximization problem is the following optimization problem @xmath76 since @xmath77 , define @xmath78 .",
    "the above problem becomes @xmath79 from variational perspective , the maximal value of the above fractional is obtained if and only if @xmath80 is aligned with eigen - vector corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "notice that matrix @xmath81 is rank - one and has only one positive eigenvalue whose eigen - vector is @xmath82 , with @xmath72 being any nonzero complex value .",
    "thus the optimal solution of the above problem is @xmath83 , from which ( [ eq : opt_g ] ) and ( [ eq : opt_snr_g ] ) can be readily obtained .    in practice",
    "the factor @xmath72 can be chosen as 1 for convenience .",

    ", we actually construct another solution sequence which is also generated by 2-block coordinate ascent method , since scaling of @xmath14 does not change the snr value . now for this new solution sequence @xmath349 , since @xmath345 while @xmath350(consequently the denominator of snr ) is bounded away from zero , we have @xmath351 , which again contradicts the increasing monotonicity of snr sequence .    in @xcite the closedness assumption of @xmath330",
    "is implicitly invoked in its proposition 2 to ensure that any limit point of solution sequence is feasible . through the above proof",
    "we can see that this result holds true thus proposition 2 in @xcite applies to our problem .",
    "the convexity assumption of @xmath330 is explicitly utilized in @xcite in its proof of proposition 3 .",
