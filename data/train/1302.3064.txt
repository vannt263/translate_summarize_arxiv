    "castelnuovo - mumford regularity ( or just the regularity ) is something of a two - way study in the sense that it is a fundamental invariant both in commutative algebra and discrete geometry .",
    "the regularity is a kind of universal bound for measuring the complexity of a considered object ( a module , a sheaf or a simplicial complex ) .",
    "our interest here is to compute or provide better bounds for the regularity of rings associated to graphs .",
    "we are primarily concerned on the computation of the regularity of the edge ring ( or equivalently the stanley - reisner ring of the independence complex ) of a given graph . one way to attack such a problem goes by translating the underlying algebraic or topological language to that of graph s .",
    "such an approach may enable us to bound the regularity of a graph via other graph parameters , and the most likely candidate is the induced matching number . by a theorem of katzman  @xcite , it is already known that the induced matching number provides a lower bound for the regularity of a graph , and the characterization of graphs in which the regularity equals to the induced matching number has been the subject of many recent papers  @xcite .    during his search on the complexity of the induced matching number , lozin  @xcite describes an operation ( he calls it as the _ stretching operation _ ) on graphs , and he proves that when it is applied to a graph , the induced matching number increases exactly by one .",
    "his operation works simply by considering a vertex @xmath0 of a graph @xmath1 whose ( open ) neighborhood splitted into two disjoint parts @xmath2 , and replacing the vertex @xmath0 with a four - path on @xmath3 together with edges @xmath4 for any @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see section  [ section : reg - lozin ] ) .",
    "one of the interesting results of his work is that the induced matching problem remains @xmath7-hard in a narrow subclass of bipartite graphs .",
    "we here prove that his operation has a similar effect on the regularity :    [ thm : lozin+reg ] let @xmath8 be a graph and let @xmath9 be given .",
    "then @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the lozin s transform of @xmath1 with respect to the vertex @xmath0 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : lozin+reg ] implies that the computational complexity of the regularity of arbitrary graphs is equivalent to that of bipartite graphs having sufficiently large girth with maximum degree three .",
    "one of the main advantages of theorem  [ thm : lozin+reg ] is that we are able to prove that the regularity of any graph can be bounded above by a function of its induced matching number .",
    "moreover , we also show that the regularity of a graph is always less than or equal to the sum of its induced matching and decycling numbers .",
    "we further employ the language of graph coloring theory by introducing a gallai type graph  @xcite associated to any given graph in order to describe a new class of graphs in which the regularity equals to the induced matching number .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section @xmath12",
    ", we fix our notations needed throughout , recall definitions and basic properties of the regularity of simplicial complexes and graphs .",
    "the section @xmath13 is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ thm : lozin+reg ] , where we also analyze the topological effect of lozin s transformation on the independence complexes of graphs . in the final section ,",

    "note that this definition of the regularity coincides with the algebraic one via the well - known hochster s formula .",
    "some of the immediate consequences of the above definition are as follows .",
    "firstly , the regularity is dependent on the characteristic of the coefficient field ( compare example @xmath22 of @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , it is not a topological invariant , and it is monotone decreasing with respect to the induced subcomplex operation , that is , @xmath23)\\leq { \\textrm{reg}}_{{\\bbbk}}({\\delta})$ ] for any @xmath24 . in most cases ,",
    "our results are independent of the choice of the coefficient field , so we drop @xmath16 from our notation .    even if the regularity is not a topological invariant , the use of topological methods plays certain roles . in many cases",

    "this proves that @xmath297 .    by theorem  [ thm : chromatic - cochord ]",
    ", we note that the inequality @xmath298 holds for any graph @xmath1 containing at least one edge .",
    "furthermore , the followings are also immediate from theorem  [ thm : chromatic - cochord ] :          one of the important problem in graph coloring theory is to provide an upper bound on the chromatic number of a graph in terms of its clique number . under certain conditions on the source graphs ,",
    "we next show that such a bound is possible for their associated graphs .",
    "for any given integer @xmath301 , we denote by @xmath302 , the class of graphs contained in @xmath303 .",
    "we proceed by an induction on the size of @xmath1 .",
    "we first note that if @xmath1 is a forest , then @xmath306 by proposition  [ prop : chordal - reg ] ; hence , @xmath307 by theorem  [ thm : chromatic - cochord ] .",
    "so , we may assume that @xmath1 contains at least one induced cycle , say @xmath308 , of order at least @xmath309 .",
    "_ proof of claim 1 .",
    "_ if the induced cycle @xmath308 contains at most one vertex of degree three , we can clearly construct such a path on @xmath308 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath311 are two vertices having degree three in @xmath1 , then all vertices ( except possibly @xmath0 and @xmath140 ) on the shortest path in @xmath308 connecting @xmath0 and @xmath140 must have degree two , since @xmath1 is @xmath312-free .",
    "moreover , the length of such a path is at least @xmath313 which proves the claim .",
    "we sometimes write @xmath330 for the graph obtained from @xmath1 by applying @xmath259 lozin s transformations on @xmath1 such that @xmath331 where @xmath332 .",
    "the following is an immediate consequence of corollary  [ cor : bound - m ] and theorem  [ thm : lozin+reg ] .      in the rest of this section , as an another application of theorem  [ thm : lozin+reg ] , we show that the regularity of a graph is always less than or equal to the sum of its induced matching and decycling numbers .",
    "to achieve this , we first verify that the whiskering of a graph with respect to a decycling set results a vertex decomposable graph which will be of independent interest .",
    "we recall that a vertex @xmath9 is called a _ leaf _ if it has only one neighbor in @xmath1 , and a _ pendant edge _ in @xmath1 is an edge which is incident to a leaf .",
    "the _ whisker _ @xmath334 of a graph @xmath8 with respect to a given subset @xmath335 is the graph constructed from @xmath1 by @xmath336 and @xmath337 . in particular , we abbreviate @xmath338 by @xmath339 ( see  @xcite ) .    for a graph @xmath1 and @xmath340 ,",
    "if @xmath341 is acyclic , i.e. , contains no induced cycle , then @xmath342 is said to be a _",
    "decycling set _ of @xmath1 .",
    "the size of a smallest decycling set of @xmath1 is called the _ decycling number _ of @xmath1 and denoted by @xmath343 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "suppose @xmath346 is a minimum decycling set of @xmath257 , and let @xmath347 be the resulting path obtained after the triple subdivision of @xmath132 .",
    "note that @xmath348 , since @xmath20 is minimal . if @xmath349 , then @xmath20 is a decycling set for @xmath1 .",
    "so , assume that @xmath350 .",
    "in such a case , the vertices @xmath50 and @xmath51 can not both belong to @xmath20 , since otherwise the set @xmath351 would still be a decycling set for @xmath257 .",

    "it then follows that the graphs @xmath361 and @xmath362 $ ] are vertex decomposable , since the vertex @xmath354 is an isolated vertex of @xmath361 , and similarly , @xmath363 is a set of isolated vertices in @xmath362 $ ] .",
    "we let @xmath365 be a graph obtained from @xmath1 by a necessary number , say @xmath366 , of triple subdivisions on @xmath1 so that it is a @xmath118-free graph .",
    "we first recall that @xmath367 by proposition  [ prop : edge - sub - div - decy ] .",
    "assume that @xmath20 is a minimal decycling set for @xmath365 .",
    "by proposition  [ prop : whisker - vd ] , the graph @xmath368 is vertex decomposable .",
    "we therefore have @xmath369 by theorem  [ thm : vd - reg ] , since @xmath368 is also @xmath118-free .",
