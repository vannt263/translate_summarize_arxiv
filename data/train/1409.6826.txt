    "hydrodynamics of relativistic outflows is of crucial importance in many astrophysical phenomena .",
    "some high - energy astrophysical phenomena found in x - ray and gamma - ray observations can naturally be explained by introducing relativistic outflows because the observed energy of a photon emitted from a particle moving at a highly relativistic speed toward an observer could become much higher than that in the rest frame of the particle .",
    "for example , emission from an expanding hot gas at relativistic speeds in spherical symmetry , which is often called a relativistic fireball , is a key ingredient to understand the dynamics of gas in extremely energetic explosive phenomena .",
    "gamma - ray bursts are one of the explosive phenomena .",
    "they are characterized by sudden appearance of a bright gamma - ray point source on the celestial sphere ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for review ) and thought to originate from stellar explosions at cosmological distances .",
    "a collimated jet launched from a compact object at relativistic speeds is needed to account for the bright gamma - ray emission .",
    "although the mechanism to produce highly energetic photons is still in debate , some mechanisms to dissipate a fraction of the kinetic energy of the flow are indispensable to account for the total energy of the gamma - ray emission .    it has been recognized that spectra of grbs are well fitted by a broken power - law , i.e. , the so - called band function @xcite .",
    "the most widely discussed model to explain spectral and temporal features of the prompt gamma - ray emission from grbs is the internal shock model , in which shocks propagating in an ultra - relativistic jet dissipate a part of the kinetic energy of the jet and produce non - thermal particles capable of emitting highly energetic photons .",
    "recent observations of grbs by the batse instrument on the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ and the _ fermi _ satellite revealed that spectra of some grbs consist of a component well fitted by a planck function in addition to non - thermal components @xcite , suggesting the presence of photospheres in ultra - relativistic jets .",
    "the photospheric emission from an ultra - relativistic jet is thought to play important roles in producing the prompt gamma - ray emission . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", contributions of the photospheric emission to grb spectra have been widely discussed @xcite . since the discovery of black - body components in grb spectra , a great attention has been paid to photospheric emission models for the prompt gamma - ray emission and investigations into the mechanism to modify a planck function into a broken power - law by some dissipative process have been put forward .",
    "the evolution of an ultra - relativistic jet and the interaction with the ambient gas are of great importance in determining the spectral and temporal features of the gamma - ray emission .",
    "especially , shock waves are an efficient and ubiquitous process to convert the kinetic energy of a flow into the internal energy .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of relativistic shock waves in various situations has been considered . the blandford - mckee solution @xcite , the relativistic extension of the sedov - taylor point explosion problem , is one of the well - known examples .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a relativistic shock in a stellar atmosphere whose density profile is described as a power of the distance from the surface has been studied by self - similar approach @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the interaction of freely expanding ejecta moving at relativistic speeds with an ambient gas is also important because it could also give rise to bright emission .",
    "a self - similar solution describing the hydrodynamical interaction was discovered by @xcite .    as the progenitor of long - duration grbs ,",
    "the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star in its final evolutionary stage is the most plausible scenario because of the so - called grb - supernova connection .",
    "the scenario is schematically illustrated in the upper panel of figure [ fig : schematic ] . in this scenario ,",
    "an ultra - relativistic jet emanating a massive star is responsible for the prompt gamma - ray emission .",
    "the injection and propagation of a jet in a massive star have been extensively studied both analytically and numerically .",
    "for example , @xcite analytically dealt with the propagation of a jet in an ambient gas and obtained a criterion for the collimation of the jet .",
    "there are a number of numerical studies on the dynamical evolution of grb jets @xcite .",
    "these studies clarified that the penetration of the jet into the stellar mantle stratified on the jet results in the formation of a hot cocoon surrounding the jet ( see the upper panel of figure [ fig : schematic ] ) . since the cocoon is created by the hydrodynamical interaction of the jet with the star , the gas in the cocoon moves at subsonic speeds .",
    "therefore , the gas starts expanding into the interstellar space in a nearly spherical manner after the cocoon emerges from the stellar surface .",
    "hereafter , we call the expanding gas as `` ejecta '' .",
    "when the jet injection continues after the emergence , the injected jet can leave the star through a hole created by the jet penetration and propagate almost freely following the ejecta .",
    "thus , freely expanding ejecta pushed by an ultra - relativistic fireball naturally realize in this scenario .",
    "in addition , one can expect that the photospheric emission from the ejecta powered by the jet would contribute to the early gamma - ray emission from grbs when the density of the ejecta is sufficiently high .",
    "on the other hand , for short grbs , the merger of double neutron stars ( nss ) in a closed binary system is a promising scenario @xcite , which is schematically illustrated in the lower panel of figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "numerical relativity is a powerful tool to investigate the dynamics of ns - ns mergers and resultant gravitational wave signals , which may be detected by next - generation gravitational wave detectors , such as , advanced ligo , advanced virgo , and kagra ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations of ns - ns mergers based on numerical general relativity revealed that materials having been bound in the gravitational potential of the binary could be accelerated to the escape velocity of the system due to the heating by the shock generated from the impact of the merger @xcite .",
    "the ejected gas travels at mildly relativistic speeds in a nearly spherical manner .",
    "then , it gradually approaches to free expansion .",
    "an ultra - relativistic jet responsible for the prompt gamma - ray emission is expected to be launched shortly after the merger .",
    "thus , the launched jet propagates in the ejected material , resulting in the hydrodynamical interaction of an ultra - relativistic fireball with a freely expanding gas @xcite .    in other words ,",
    "the hydrodynamical interaction of an ultra - relativistic fireball with an expanding gas naturally realizes in potential long and short grb progenitors .",
    "then , in this paper , we consider an ultra - relativistic fireball following expanding ejecta and investigate their hydrodynamical interaction in spherical symmetry . in section [ evolution ] , the dynamical evolution of the gas is studied in approximate and numerical ways .",
    "the propagation of the shocks forming as results of the hydrodynamical interaction between the gases is investigated in detail in section [ shock_waves ] .",
    "then , we discuss possible processes to produce high - energy emission in section [ sec : emission ] .",
    "we conclude this paper in section [ sec : conclusions ] . in the following ,",
    "we use the unit @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the speed of light .",
    "in this section , we consider the dynamical evolution of ejecta expanding into the interstellar space and being followed by an ultra - relativistic fireball in spherical symmetry . thus , hydrodynamical variables are functions of the time @xmath2 and the radial coordinate @xmath3 .",
    "we denote the radial velocity , the density , and the pressure of the gas by , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of these variables is governed by the following hydrodynamical equations in spherical symmetry , @xmath7 @xmath8}{\\partial ( r^3/3)}=\\frac{2p}{r } , \\label{eq : momentum}\\ ] ] and @xmath9 where the lorentz factor @xmath10 is expressed in terms of the velocity as , @xmath11 and the specific enthalpy @xmath12 for an ideal gas with an adiabatic index @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 in this work , we assume that the gas is radiation - dominated and thus the adiabatic index is fixed to be @xmath15 .      at first , we consider the profiles of the physical variables in the fireball .",
    "the relativistic fireball solution @xcite is a well - known solution for the special relativistic hydrodynamical equations in spherical symmetry .",
    "a great attention has been paid to this solution to reveal the nature of grb jets . in the following ,",
    "we briefly review the solution .",
    "we consider a gas continuously injected from @xmath16 at constant mass and energy injection rates , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a non - dimensional parameter , @xmath19 , which gives the ratio of the energy injection rate to the mass injection rate , @xmath20    we assume that the flow is ultra - relativistic , @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the balance of the mass and the energy fluxes , equations ( [ eq : continuity ] ) and ( [ eq : energy ] ) , at @xmath3 yields @xmath22 and @xmath23 furthermore , the gas is adiabatic along the streamline , @xmath24    when the internal energy of the gas dominates over its rest mass energy , @xmath25 , the gas expands by converting its internal energy into the kinetic one . in this case",
    ", the dependence of the lorentz factor , the density , and the pressure on the radial coordinate is found to be , @xmath26 on the other hand , for a gas with the rest mass energy much larger than the internal one , @xmath27 , the radial profiles of the variables are as follows , @xmath28 which is identical with a wind solution with constant velocity and mass - loss rate .",
    "when a gas with the internal energy much larger than the rest mass energy is released in a small region , the gas initially expands according to equations ( [ eq : fireball1 ] ) .",
    "then the kinetic energy eventually dominates over the internal one and the gas finally reaches to the state well described by equations ( [ eq : fireball2 ] ) .",
    "when the ejecta pushed by an ultra - relativistic fireball are slower than the fireball and the pressure at the interface between the ejecta and the fireball is sufficiently small , the forward and reverse shocks form at the interface and the swept gas forms a geometrically thin shell .",
    "we call the resultant shocked gas as the `` shell '' hereafter .",
    "then , before going to numerical calculations , we derive the dependence of physical variables of the shell on the time @xmath2 using a thin shell approximation .",
    "we denote the mass of the shell by @xmath29 .",
    "the shell is accelerated by the pressure gradient inside the shell .",
    "when we denote the pressure of the post - shock gas of the forward and the reverse shocks by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the equation of motion of the shell at a position @xmath32 , which governs the time dependence of the lorentz factor @xmath33 of the shell , is expressed as follows , @xmath34 here , we assume the lorentz factor @xmath33 to be much larger than unity and consider the following limit , @xmath21 . thus , the position @xmath35 of the shell is proportional to the time @xmath2 , @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , the post - shock pressure @xmath30 at the forward shock is assumed to be much smaller than that @xmath31 at the reverse shock , @xmath37 .",
    "then , the equation of motion can be approximated as follows , @xmath38 the dependence of the post - shock pressure @xmath31 is determined by the shock jump condition at the reverse shock .",
    "the pressure is proportional to the product of the density of the fireball and the square of the ratio of the lorentz factors , @xmath39 and @xmath33 , of the fireball and the shell under the strong shock approximation ( see appendix [ jump_condition ] , for the derivation of the jump condition at the reverse shock ) , @xmath40 where we denote the pre - shock density at the reverse shock by @xmath41 , which is proportional to the inverse square of the time , @xmath42 , according to equation ( [ eq : fireball2 ] ) .",
    "we regard the lorentz factor @xmath19 of the fireball as a constant , because the fireball approaches to a steady wind solution at a large distance .",
    "the equation of motion is finally written as , @xmath43 this equation can be solved once the dependence of the mass @xmath29 on the time @xmath2 is determined .",
    "we consider cases where the mass is proportional to a power of the time @xmath2 , @xmath44 .",
    "the exponent @xmath45 can not be negative as long as the system evolves in spherical symmetry , because the mass of the gas swept by the reverse and the forward shocks would increase with time .",
    "for example , one may assume that the mass of the shell is dominated by that of the ejecta and most of the ejecta have been swept by the forward shock .",
    "in this case , the mass hardly changes with time , @xmath46 .    under this assumption ,",
    "the temporal behavior of the lorentz factor turns out to be @xmath47 we also obtain the time dependence of the pressure at the reverse shock as , @xmath48    , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 s are shown as thin solid lines .",
    "the initial profiles for these variables are also plotted as thick dashed lines . ]",
    "we have demonstrated that a geometrically thin shell pushed by an ultra - relativistic fireball accelerates due to the pressure gradient inside the shell under the thin shell approximation . in order to obtain the profiles of hydrodynamical variables in the shell , we have to numerically integrate the hydrodynamical equations ( [ eq : continuity ] ) - ( [ eq : enthalpy ] ) .",
    "numerical methods including the adaptive mesh refinement used in this work are briefly described in appendix [ numerical_techniques ] .",
    "numerical calculations are performed in a spherical coordinate system from @xmath16 to @xmath54 . in this simulation , an expanding gas is created by injecting a part of the energy from the fireball into a static gas , imitating situations expected to realize in long grb progenitors .",
    "initially , a static gas with the density inversely proportional to the square of the radius is distributed from @xmath16 to @xmath55 , and surrounded by a dilute gas with a steady wind profile , which is referred to as the circum - stellar medium ( csm ) , @xmath56 the gas is assumed to be cold . however , zero pressure can not be treated in the numerical code used in this work .",
    "thus , we use sufficiently small , but non - zero values for the pressure of the csm .",
    "the following pressure profile is employed so that the pressure of the gas does not interrupt the propagation of shocks resulting from the impact of the fireball injection , @xmath57    the boundary condition at @xmath16 must be specified to launch a fireball . for a given set of the initial lorentz factor @xmath58 , the kinetic luminosity @xmath18 , and the parameter @xmath19 , the following conditions for the velocity , the density , and the pressure are imposed at @xmath16 , @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 the pressure at the inner boundary @xmath62",

    "after the forward shock finishes sweeping the gas , the shocked gas starts expanding into the surrounding medium , which corresponds to the `` ejecta '' .",

    "the difference between the pressure of the preceding ejecta and that of the reverse - shocked fireball gets larger as time elapses , resulting in the formation of a shock propagating into the ejecta .    finally , the system is composed of the following layers from the inner boundary to the outer edge of the ejecta , ( 1 ) unshocked fireball , ( 2 ) reverse - shocked fireball , ( 3 ) forward - shocked ejecta , and ( 4 ) unshocked ejecta . figure [ fig : profile100 ] presents the radial profiles of the lorentz factor , the density and the pressure of the shell at @xmath82 and @xmath83 s. the forward shock eventually develops after the pressure of the preceding ejecta becomes sufficiently smaller than that of the reverse - shocked fireball . in the left panel of figure [ fig : profile100 ] ,",

    "the density of the ambient gas is set to a sufficiently small value so that the ejecta are hardly affected by the interaction with the ambient gas . as a consequence , the resultant ejecta travel almost freely as seen in figure [ fig : profile100 ] . in the following sections , we focus on the reverse and forward shocks at the fireball - ejecta interface and do not consider the waves expected to develop at the ejecta - ambient gas interface for the sake of simplicity .",
    "in the previous section , we have demonstrated that a shock naturally forms in the expanding ejecta due to the fireball - ejecta interaction . in the numerical simulation , we have created a freely expanding gas by injecting an energy into a static gas at the same rate as the fireball .",

    "the thus estimated observed photon energy is shown as a function of the breakout radius in figure [ fig : breakout ]    although we have assumed that the number of photons does not change in the course of the energy equipartition , some processes changing the number of photons and electrons , such as , double compton scattering and pair production , may increase the number densities of photons and electrons and change the average photon energy .",
    "the thermal evolution of the mixture of gas and radiation toward the energy equipartition should be investigated in detail to find the accurate value of the average photon energy . in the following",
    ", we simply regard that emission with the photon energy given in equation ( [ eq : e_obs_fs ] ) is observed as the shock breakout emission .",
    "the isotropic luminosity of the breakout emission is estimated as follows .",
    "we have assumed that the internal energy of the post - shock gas is dominated by radiation .",
    "in addition , we assume that the radiation field in the post - shock gas is isotropic in the comoving frame of the gas and the gas is moving at ultra - relativistic speeds , @xmath175 . from the lorentz transformation of the energy - momentum tensor of the radiation field , the radiative flux @xmath176 along the radial direction in the laboratory frame can be obtained as , @xmath177 the isotropic luminosity for the breakout emission with the breakout radius @xmath155 is estimated to be @xmath178 where we have introduced a parameter @xmath179 representing the efficiency of the emission .",
    "the thus estimated luminosity with @xmath180 is shown as a function of the breakout radius in figure [ fig : breakout ] .",
    "after the shock breakout emission , the photospheric emission from the shocked fireball is expected .",
    "we estimate the average photon energy of the post - shock gas in the same way as the breakout emission .",
    "we evaluate the photon number density immediately after the shock passage .",
    "the number density of photons is expected to be @xmath181 before being swept by the shock .",
    "thus , the post - shock value of the photon number density leads to @xmath182 we estimate the average photon energy @xmath183 by dividing the post - shock internal energy , which is given by @xmath184 , by the post - shock photon number density , @xmath185 since the post - shock lorentz factor for the reverse shock with the lorentz factor @xmath186 is given by @xmath187 the average photon energy in the observer frame leads to @xmath188      then , we estimate the isotropic luminosity of the photospheric emission when the photosphere is close to the reverse shock in the same way as the breakout emission .",
    "the isotropic luminosity @xmath189 is estimated to be @xmath190 where a parameter @xmath191 representing the efficiency of the emission has been introduced .      in the previous sections ,",
    "we propose that the breakout emission from the forward shock in the ejecta and the photospheric emission from the reverse shocked fireball could contribute to the prompt emission of grbs .    as described in section [ sec : breakout ] , larger breakout radii are realized when smaller values of the parameter @xmath152 are assumed .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath152 depends the energy and the mass of the ejecta and thus reflects the structure of the stellar envelope and the energy deposition from the fireball at the initial phase of the injection .",
    "since a smaller value of @xmath152 represents a slower forward shock , the breakout occurs at a later phase of the dynamical evolution , resulting in the breakout in more dilute medium and less luminous emission .",
    "this is why a larger breakout radius ( or equivalently smaller @xmath152 ) produce emission with smaller values of the average photon energy and the luminosity as shown in figure [ fig : breakout ] .",
    "furthermore , for a fireball with a larger kinetic power and a mass injection rate , a more bright emission is expected .",
    "recent observations of grbs by the _",
    "satellite have revealed temporal behaviors of the prompt gamma - ray emission in great detail .",
    "especially , the delayed detection of gev photons @xcite is one of the outstanding features of bursts observed by _",
    "fermi_. in other words , spectra become harder in the later phase of the prompt emission .",
    "in addition , components well fitted by planck functions are found in the prompt emission in the first few seconds after the trigger @xcite .    from our model",
    ", the emission from the forward shock emerging from the photosphere in the expanding ejecta can be detected as an early electromagnetic signal .",
    "if we take a model with the breakout radius of @xmath192 for example , the observed average photon energy and the isotropic luminosity are estimated to be @xmath193 and @xmath194 which are in good agreement with the observed temperature and luminosity of the thermal components in batse bursts @xcite .    after the shock emergence , the photosphere moves into the inner region of the shell and the photospheric emission from the reverse - shocked fireball starts contributing to the prompt gamma - ray emission . in this region ,",
    "the kinetic power of the jet is converted to the internal energy of the shocked gas and escape as radiation .",
    "thus , the luminosity of the emission from the reverse shock is constant as we have assumed the steady energy injection . for the fireball with @xmath74 erg s@xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath78 , which is corresponding to @xmath77 , the observed average photon energy and the isotropic luminosity yield @xmath195 and @xmath196 these values are similar to the typical values of the spectral peak energy and the isotropic gamma - ray energy of grbs .",
    "the shocked gas finally becomes transparent and the emission from the ultra - relativistic fireball can be seen .",
    "the delayed gev emission might correspond to the emission from the ultra - relativistic fireball .",
    "the photospheric emission from the unshocked ejecta would also contribute to the prompt and the afterglow emission from grbs in soft x - ray range .",
    "recent discovery of a thermal component ( @xmath197-@xmath198 kev ) in soft x - ray spectra of some bursts observed by _",
    "_ xrt ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has invoked discussions on the origin of the component .",
    "the hydrodynamical interaction between the ambient gas and the ejecta may be important in understanding the origin of the thermal x - ray emission as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the hydrodynamical interaction of an ultra - relativistic fireball with a gas expanding almost freely and studied the dynamical evolution of the resultant geometrically thin shell in analytical and numerical ways . in the analytical considerations ,",
    "the shell is assumed to have an infinitesimal width and the time dependence of the lorentz factor is derived from the equation of motion of the shell .",
    "then , we perform a simulation by using a one - dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics code with amr technique to resolve the inner structure of the shell . the resultant temporal evolution of the shell is compared with the analytical considerations .",
    "we point out a possibility that the emission from the forward and reverse shocks at the fireball - ejecta interface could contribute to the prompt gamma - ray emission of grbs .",
    "our findings indicate that the dynamical evolution of the gas ahead of the ultra - relativistic fireball is of critical importance in understanding the temporal behavior of the photospheric emission recently found in some bursts .",
    "we have estimated only the average photon energy and the isotropic luminosity expected in the breakout and the photospheric emission . to investigate the temporal evolutions of these quantities , detailed calculations on how the photosphere in the ejecta evolves with time are required .",
    "we regard investigations of the temporal evolution of the photospheric emission as a future work . we claim that it is needed to clarify whether the possibility proposed in this work is actually responsible for early emission from grbs .",
    "finally , we note some remarks on the present work . we create freely expanding ejecta by injecting a jet into a gas with a power - law density profile and then investigate the hydrodynamical interaction between the ejecta and the jet . freely expanding ejecta with different density structure",
    "might be realized in some short grb progenitor .",
    "although the analysis of the density structure of freely expanding ejecta resulting from a ns - ns merger in recent simulations of a ns - ns merger @xcite revealed that the density profile is well described by a power - law function of the radius , we can not exclude a possibility that ejecta with a more complex density profile could be created as a result of a ns - ns merger .    while this work considers the dynamical evolution of the fireball and the ejecta in spherical symmetry , the gamma - ray emitting region of a grb",
    "is thought to be highly collimated .",
    "the discrepancy between the spherical and jet models should be treated carefully .",
    "earlier numerical studies of the jet propagation in a massive star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) revealed that the inner part of the jet is well described by the spherical fireball model . on the other hand , at earlier stages of the dynamical evolution of a grb jet , when the jet propagates in the star , materials are accumulated on the head of the jet .",
    "after the jet emerges from the surface , the gas on the head of the jet expands in the lateral direction , which would lead to the ejecta with a mass smaller than that expected for spherical cases .",
    "however , once the bulk lorentz factor of the jet reaches to the critical value given by the inverse of the opening angle of the jet , @xmath199 , the ejecta and the jet could be treated as a conical part of a spherical outflow until the lorentz factor decreases to the critical value and the jet break occurs .",

    "we describe the derivation of the shock jump condition at a strong shock propagating into a cold gas for the completeness of this paper .",
    "details of the derivation can be found in some textbooks or review papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these equations can be rewritten as follows , @xmath218 and some algebraic manipulations in the above expressions lead to the following equation , @xmath219 since the flows are highly relativistic , @xmath220 , one obtains the following approximated expression of the above equation , @xmath221 one can find the lorentz factor @xmath208 of the flow in the downstream for a given set of the lorentz factor of the gas in the upstream and the shock lorentz factor , @xmath207 and @xmath212 , by solving this equation .    equation ( [ app : mass ] ) can be solved for the density @xmath204 of the flow in the downstream and approximated under the assumption of highly relativistic flows as follows , @xmath222 furthermore , the elimination of the enthalpy @xmath217 from equations ( [ app : momentum ] ) and ( [ app : energy ] ) yields @xmath223 which is approximated as , @xmath224 therefore , one finds the density and the pressure of the gas in the downstream from equations ( [ app1:expression_for_rho ] ) and ( [ app1:expression_for_p ] ) , once the lorentz factor @xmath208 of the flow in the downstream is obtained .",
