    "this short paper is devoted to some strange dynamical aspects around a problem which is often presented as the simplest one in quantum mechanics , namely the infinite one - dimensional well , although such a point of view can be seriously questioned ( for instance , what about the heisenberg equations of motion for the infinite well ? ) . indeed ,",
    "when going beyond academic elementary questions , this problem is _ not _ simple , and even turns out to be somewhat tricky , all subtleties obviously originating from the infinite discontinuities of the potential , which generates an infinity of bound states with an energy @xmath3 increasing without limit like the square of the quantum number @xmath4 .",
    "this immediately entails that the propagator involves gauss series ( the jacobi @xmath5-function being one very special case @xcite ) , which are known to possess quite uncommon features ; as an example , holschneider @xcite shows that when the coefficients @xmath6 of the series are @xmath7 , the sum is a self - similar function in a precisely defined sense .",
    "here , i only aim to give a brief account of intriguing results , together with a far from being complete theoretical explanation and proof .    to be sure and strictly speaking ,",
    "infinite discontinuities can be discarded on physical grounds , but they conveniently modelize a situation where the depth @xmath8 of the well is much greater than all other relevant energies , and where the space variation of the potential occurs on a length scale @xmath9 much smaller than all the others . be it said in passing , for this reason , the classical limit of the infinite well is not a trivial point , due to the fact that one should first properly consider simultaneously the two limits @xmath10 _ and _ @xmath11 , in order to check whether they commute or not and , if they do not , to choose the physically relevant limiting procedure for the considered case ( for another example , see @xcite ,  1.6 ) .    the problem at hand is the following .",
    "given that the particle ( mass @xmath12 ) is initially in an eigenstate of an infinite well , the well is instantaneously expanded to a larger size : what is the subsequent evolution of such a prepared initial state in the enlarged well ? some aspects of this problem have already been studied @xcite  @xcite ; here i focus on results which are absent of these works and , up to my knowledge , seem unquoted in the literature .",
    "obviously , any possible connection with an experiment would first of all require a proper analysis of various time scales , in order to be sure that the following theoretical framework is relevant to the experimental device .",
    "let us now enter into the specific problem and precise the notations used throughout .",
    "taking , for the non - expanded well , @xmath13 when @xmath14 and infinite elsewhere , the normalized eigenfunctions are : @xmath15 and vanish outside this interval ; the eigenenergies are : @xmath16 @xmath4 is a strictly positive integer , whereas @xmath17 is the smallest time - period of any time - dependent state built as a linear combination of the @xmath18 s .    from now on ,",
    "i assume that , the particle being in the ground state @xmath19 of the infinite well of width @xmath20 , the latter is suddenly stretched at some time taken as @xmath21 , increasing in size from @xmath20 to @xmath22 with @xmath23 . since the initial state @xmath24 is not a stationary state of the dilated well , @xmath25 has a non - trivial time - dependence and , among other things , expectation values of the observables which do not commute with the hamiltonian at @xmath26 show up actual time - dependence .",
    "i will focus on two of them , namely the probability density @xmath27 and the density probability current @xmath28 defined as usual : @xmath29\\enspace ,      \\label{denscourant}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 denotes the imaginary part .",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are related by the local conservation equation @xmath33 .",
    "a few results concerning the averages of the position and the momentum of the particle will be briefly quoted at the end of the paper .    on the other hand ,",
    "the expectation value of the energy does not change since no work is done on the particle when the well is expanded ; this obvious physical fact will be analytically checked in due time . as for the variance of the energy , it vanishes before the expansion , but turns out to be infinite once the latter has been performed ( see ) .",
    "the eigensolutions of the expanded well are simply obtained by making @xmath34 in formulas ( [ eigensol ] ) and ( [ eigenenergies ] ) , namely : @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and : @xmath37 note that if @xmath38 is an irrational number , the two spectra @xmath3 and @xmath39 have no coincidence at all .",
    "the dilatation of the well lowers each eigenenergy , and yields an increased energy density ( in infinite space , the spectrum is continuous ) .",
    "the resulting state at time @xmath26 , @xmath25 , can be developed on the complete eigenstates @xmath40 , and has an expansion of the form : @xmath41 note that , as thoroughly discussed by styer@xcite in connection with the classical limit , it immediately results that the motion is periodic , with the period @xmath42 , since the expansion of @xmath25 only contains integer multiples of the circular frequency @xmath43 ; as obvious on physical grounds , enlarging the well _ increases _ the period @xmath44 of the motion : for an infinite expansion , the motion is not periodic since , among other things , the wavepacket would spread out _ ad infinitum_. also note that the wavefunction at time @xmath45 is given by a gauss series , _",
    "i.e. _ a trigonometric series with time - oscillating factors of the form @xmath46 , as contrasted to @xmath47 in a fourier series .",
    "this yields quite rapid and irregular variations in time , all the more when the series coefficients decrease slowly with @xmath4 , which is the case here ( see ( [ coefinitexppl ] ) ) .    as for the coefficients @xmath6 ,",
    "they are found by writing down the initial condition @xmath48 , and are thus equal to the scalar products @xmath49 , namely : @xmath50 note that the integral actually runs from @xmath51 to @xmath20 , since @xmath19 vanishes for any @xmath1 greater than @xmath20 .",
    "a straightforward integration yields : @xmath52 so that the wavefunction at time @xmath53 can be eventually written as : @xmath54 for @xmath55 , it being understood that @xmath25 vanishes outside the enlarged well .    for any given time @xmath45",
    ", @xmath25 is a continuous function of @xmath1 and of @xmath45 ; this is recognized from the fact that the coefficients @xmath6 behave like @xmath56 for large @xmath4 , ensuring that the series in ( [ psiplusagr ] ) is uniformly convergent .",
    "obviously , this is not true for the @xmath1- or @xmath45-derivatives of @xmath25 ( remember that the potential has _ infinite _ discontinuities ) .    by construction ,",
    "each exponential function @xmath57 satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 : as it is the case for any stationary state in one dimension , the probability current constant in space , @xmath60 .",
    "this entails that performing a term - by - term derivation of the expansion ( [ psiplusagr ] ) to get the formal expression of the current @xmath28 related to @xmath25 can only generate singular terms , arising from the difference between the derivative of a function , and the series of the derivatives ; these singularities turn out to be dirac functions , which means that , for a given time , @xmath28 is a piecewice constant function of @xmath1 .",
    "several examples of this will be given in due time .",
    "note that making @xmath21 in the rhs of ( [ psiplusagr ] ) leads to the function equal to @xmath61 for @xmath62 , and equal to zero for @xmath63 , since @xmath48 : in view of the sequel and considering the whole interval @xmath64 $ ] , this allows to say ( trivially at this point ) that the initial probability density shows up a _ plateau _ with a vanishing value for @xmath65 . from this , one concludes that the following equality holds true for any @xmath66 $ ] : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the unit step function ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , as well as all the other equalities obtained by a term - by - term derivation ; all of them can be @xmath71-periodized in @xmath1 if needed .",
    "the important point to realize is that the series in the lhs of ( [ identities ] ) is identically zero for any @xmath1 such that @xmath72 .",
    "it turns out unnecessary to define the step function for @xmath73 , since all the corresponding terms are multiplied by functions vanishing at this point .",
    "as we will see , one strange thing ( among others ) is that the probability density at time @xmath45 also shows up _ plateaux _ ( but not always with a _ vanishing _ value ) , in other finite intervals @xmath74 $ ] at given periodic times ; this can be figured out as the recurrent ghosts of the initial flatness on @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "also note that if @xmath76 ( no change of the well ) , all coefficients go to zero , except for @xmath77 which equals 1 , as it must be .",
    "more generally , if @xmath78 is a positive integer @xmath79 , the indetermination for @xmath80 is left by setting @xmath81 , and by taking the limit @xmath82 . for @xmath83 , one",
    "thus obtains : @xmath84    also note from ( [ psiplusagr ] ) that @xmath85 , so that @xmath86 : at times @xmath45 and @xmath87 the two density distributions coincide , but since the two wavefunctions are complex conjugate , the two corresponding wavepackets have _ opposite _ group velocities ; for the same reason the current satisfies @xmath88 .",
    "other symmetry properties can be found by inspection of the series ( [ psiplusagr ] ) ; for example , one easily sees that for @xmath89 , @xmath90 , namely that at a quarter of the period ( or at three - quarter ) , the density profile is even with regards to the middle of the dilated well .",
    "other relations exist when both the abscissa and the time are changed , for instance one has @xmath91 for any @xmath1 and @xmath45 .",
    "as we shall see , such symmetries play an important role , in particular to get closed convenient expressions for density and current at some remarkable times .    since the initial state @xmath19 is normalized to unity , so is @xmath25 at any time ; this can be checked by a direct summation of the series @xmath92 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the surprise comes when plotting the probability density @xmath27 at different times .",
    "some examples are given in figs.[psi2puitsdil1.5 ] - [ psi2puitsdil5.5 ] , which show that for very special times , the probability density assumes _ constant values _ in some definite intervals included in @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "as already said , these _ plateaux _ can be figured out as the echoes of the flatness of @xmath93 with a zero height in the range @xmath75 $ ] for @xmath1 .",
    "the theoretical explanation of the existence of the _ plateaux _ lies on arguments which could be more firmly grounded if mathematical rigor were required .",
    "the basic idea is to use the second derivative @xmath2 as an indicator , since its singularities determine the absciss where @xmath25 can have a cusp .",
    "indeed , let us assume for definiteness that @xmath94 is an abscissa to the left of which @xmath25 is increasing , and is constant on the right .",
    "this means that the first derivative @xmath95 has a negative jump at @xmath94 , entailing that the second derivative contains an additive singular term @xmath96 with a negative weight , @xmath97 being the dirac function ( remember that if a function @xmath98 has a jump @xmath99 at @xmath100 , its derivative is @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the ordinary derivative ) . at such a singular point , the derivative @xmath95 has a jump , so that , generally speaking , the density @xmath103 shows up a cusp . due to the general properties of the schrdinger equation , singularities are indeed to be expected in the second derivative in the presence of infinite discontinuities of the potential",
    "; they merely reflect , on a quantum mechanical level , the jumps of the velocity of a bouncing classical particle .",
    "these singularities , located at @xmath73 and @xmath104 at @xmath21 actually move about in the interval @xmath64 $ ] as time increases .",
    "the second derivative of @xmath25 is obtained by a term - by - term derivation of the expansion ( [ psiplusagr ] ) ; by writing @xmath105 , it can be recast in the form : @xmath106 where : @xmath107 is the only singular part of @xmath108 . the factor in the first term in the rhs of ( [ psiseconde ] )",
    "is recognized as @xmath109 and comes from the ( ordinary ) laplacian operator in the ( time - dependent ) schrdinger equation .",
    "now , having in mind the well - known fourier expansion of the dirac comb : @xmath110 it is realized that @xmath111 embodies dirac functions whenever the series in ( [ partsingder2 ] ) contains an infinite countable set of terms of the kind @xmath112 , each having a coefficient which is independent of the dummy summation label . in order to explore this possibility ,",
    "i rewrite the expression ( [ partsingder2 ] ) as follows : @xmath113\\,\\e^{-\\i n^{2}\\omega_{\\lambda } t }            \\enspace.\\hspace{5pt}\\label{partsingder2bis}\\ ] ] first of all , note that for @xmath104 , the first series in ( [ partsingder2bis ] ) reduces to @xmath114 , _",
    "i.e. _ generates a dirac comb whenever @xmath115 for an infinite countable set of values for @xmath4 ; this is the case if @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 integers : for all values of @xmath4 of the form @xmath119 ( @xmath120 integer ) , one has @xmath121 , which of the desired form : @xmath122 . at this stage , and considering only the first series in ( [ partsingder2bis ] ) , it is seen that a cusp _ can _ occur for @xmath25 , with @xmath123 since the weight of @xmath124 is then clearly a positive quantity .",
    "note that the same argument also holds for all the points of the form @xmath125 even integer but all the corresponding abscissare outside the relevant interval @xmath64 $ ] and may be ignored .",
    "this tells us that @xmath104 is a good candidate , but this is just the beginning of the story , due to the existence of the second series in ( [ partsingder2bis ] ) . to show what can happen ,",
    "let us set @xmath104 in both exponentials ; the whole series then writes @xmath126 in fact , it can happen that for all countably set of `` good '' values of the integer @xmath4 , the two exponentials cancel each other , annihilating the possibility for the point @xmath104 to be a cusp .",
    "for definiteness , and as an example , let us go back to fig.[psi2puitsdil1.5 ] , and consider the curve @xmath127 where the density clearly shows up a `` normal '' maximum at @xmath104 . for this case , one has @xmath128 and @xmath129 in the above notations , which entails that the good values for @xmath4 are @xmath130 ( @xmath131 integer ) ; then , the only non - vanishing factors @xmath132 are for @xmath133 , but for @xmath134 and @xmath135 , they have opposite signs , so that the two related dirac combs indeed have opposite weights , and the singularity at @xmath104 disappears . thus , the point @xmath104 is not _ always _ such a remarkable point .",
    "let us now show that other values of the couple @xmath136 can define the edges of the _ plateaux _ , without trying to give an exhaustive catalogue of all these possibilities , just aiming at giving a few sufficient conditions for that .",
    "the second exponential term @xmath137 in ( [ partsingder2bis ] ) is equal to @xmath138 for any @xmath4 if @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath131 integers , and if @xmath4 is an even multiple of @xmath131 ; the constraint @xmath36 entails @xmath141 .",
    "this being realized , the conditions for the time - varying factor @xmath142 are the same as above , namely @xmath45 must be a rational fraction of the period @xmath44 : @xmath116 .",
    "one example of such a case can be seen in fig.[psi2puitsdil1.5 ] , where @xmath143 . for @xmath89 ( @xmath144 ) ,",
    "@xmath128 , @xmath145 in the above notations .",
    "close inspection reveals that @xmath104 is indeed a cusp , as well as @xmath146 ( take @xmath147 ) ; there is numerical evidence , and this is analytically proved below , that these points are in fact the edges of a _",
    "plateau_. note that the signs of the dirac combs can be reversed ; for instance with @xmath139 , if @xmath140 is odd and @xmath4 an _ odd _ multiple of @xmath131 , @xmath148 ( as examples , see the curves @xmath149 and @xmath150 in fig.[psi2puitsdil1.5 ] , for which the density increases on the left and to the right of the _ plateau _ ) .",
    "obviously , the existence of cusps is just a necessary condition for the occurrence of the _ plateaux_. in order to analytically demonstrate their existence , one must generally prove that between two so identified given cusps , the density is indeed constant .",
    "this seems to be a rather intricate and difficult mathematical problem ; in this short preliminary paper , i just intend to demonstrate this in a few specific cases , hoping to give a more complete and general proof in a future article .",
    "it turns out that for some definite times @xmath151 , closed expressions of the wavefunction @xmath152 can be written down .",
    "i will here consider only the three cases @xmath153 with @xmath154 , before showing the existence of quite another strange phenomenon , namely the fragmentation of the wavepacket and the existence of regular patterns when @xmath78 is above a characteristic threshold @xmath155 , depending on the specific time considered .",
    "the basic idea is to play with the time phase factors appearing in the expansion ( [ psiplusagr ] ) , and to express @xmath152 as a linear combination of the known initial wavefunction taken at different absciss@xmath156 .",
    "the generalisation for times of the form @xmath157 ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 integers , @xmath158 ) seems quite feasible , although it promises to be somewhat cumbersome as long as a more elegant method is not available .",
    "a first observation is the following ; at half of a period ( @xmath127 ) , a simple glance at the series ( [ psiplusagr ] ) allows to establish the following equality : @xmath159 which is just the symmetry relation ( [ symmtttx ] ) for @xmath21 ; now , since @xmath93 is known ( this is @xmath19 , which identically vanishes between @xmath104 and @xmath160 ) , the equality ( [ psits2 ] ) just gives a closed simple expression for the wavefunction at this remarkable time . in the following , i show how such a method can be used for the other times defined above .",
    "the case @xmath143 ( see fig.[psi2puitsdil1.5 ] ) and the spectacular _ plateau _ occurring for @xmath89 draws attention on this peculiar time . to start with and to introduce the method ,",
    "let us analyze the things in details , but for any @xmath78 .",
    "the clue is simply to realize that for this peculiar time , the time - dependent exponential in ( [ psiplusagr ] ) is equal to 1 if @xmath4 is even , and if @xmath4 is odd .",
    "this allows to write @xmath161 in the form : @xmath162 where the two ( real ) sums @xmath163 and @xmath164 respectively correspond to even and odd values for the summation index @xmath4 .",
    "now that all the time - factors in the rhs of ( [ psidect4 ] ) are fixed , it is tempting to compare such an expansion with @xmath93 , which has a quite simple expression ; observing that : @xmath165 and : @xmath166 the two sums @xmath167 can now be expressed in terms of @xmath93 , which is known , thus readily obtaining the sum of the series ( [ psiplusagr ] ) at this time : @xmath168      \\enspace,\\label{psiat4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an equality which yields the closed simple expression of the density for any @xmath78 : @xmath169 with still @xmath55 .",
    "let me now choose @xmath143 ; from ( [ psi2lt4 ] ) , it immediately results that : @xmath170 which proves the existence of the _ plateau _ between @xmath171 and @xmath20 in this definite case .",
    "note that this density is built in the following way : take the initial density , cut it into two pieces in the middle , translate the right part to the right of the distance @xmath20 , draw a horizontal line between the two _ maxima _ , and divide the whole by a factor 2 .",
    "we will recover such rules below , showing that the density at some other remarkable times can be built by playing with pieces of the initial density .",
    "the expression ( [ psi2lt4 ] ) is true at @xmath89 for any @xmath78 , and has two clearcut behaviours according to @xmath172 or @xmath173 . in the first case ,",
    "the two @xmath174 functions are simultaneously non - zero in the interval @xmath175 $ ] , so that : @xmath176 this shows that for @xmath177 but @xmath178 , the function at @xmath179 has no _ plateau _ ; in fact , for all such values of @xmath78 , numerical plots show that the latter does exist , but for other times and not located between the two simple values @xmath171 and @xmath20 . clearly",
    "the relative simplicity of the @xmath143 case is due to the fact that @xmath78 is a `` simple '' rational number .",
    "note that the @xmath1-derivative of the density is equal to the real part @xmath180 ; one easily checks from the expression ( [ psiat4 ] ) that , for @xmath172 ( and still @xmath89 ) , @xmath180 never identically vanishes in a finite interval .",
    "also note that if @xmath161 as given by ( [ psiat4 ] ) is a continuous function of @xmath1 ( as it must be ) , its @xmath1-derivative is not , although it is devoid of dirac peaks due to the cancellation of @xmath25 at each jump of the derivative : the density @xmath31 , a continuous function of @xmath1 , can indeed shows up cusps .",
    "for @xmath173 , the two intervals @xmath181 $ ] and @xmath182 $ ] do not overlap ; then , expression ( [ psi2lt4 ] ) says that the wavefunction identically vanishes at @xmath89 for any @xmath183 $ ] .",
    "examples of this are illustrated in figs.[psi2puitsdil2.5 ] and [ psi2puitsdil5.5 ] ; it is seen that @xmath103 vanishes between @xmath20 and @xmath184 for @xmath185 , between @xmath20 and @xmath186 if @xmath187 .",
    "thus , for @xmath89 and @xmath173 , the wavepacket splits in two distant parts : the particle is fully localized in two intervals separated by a finite one ; in each interval , the profile is the clone of the initial one , just divided by 2 .",
    "this _ fragmentation _ into identical curves will also occur for @xmath188 : then , i will find four identical well - separated clusters , provided that @xmath78 is greater ( see section [ fragmentation ] ) , each of them being one - quarter of the initial density @xmath189 properly translated .    as explained above",
    ", the current probability density @xmath28 is a constant piecewise function , generally having jumps when the first derivative of the wavefunction is discontinuous ; otherwise stated , the jumps of @xmath28 also occur whenever the singular part @xmath190 contains a dirac comb .",
    "this turns out to happen in many points of the interval @xmath64 $ ] , as seen in fig.[psi2cour32 ] , where all the functions have been numerically computed from the series ( [ psiplusagr ] ) .",
    "these plots also show that there is not necessary a direct relation between the jumps of the current and the edges of the _ plateaux _ , and reveals the irregular variation of @xmath95 , which is not always clearly visible on the plot of the density , all the more since a cusp can occur only if @xmath191 .",
    "now , starting from ( [ denscourant ] ) with @xmath161 given by ( [ psiat4 ] ) , a straightforward calculation yields the piecewice constant expression : @xmath192\\,\\sin\\pi\\lambda       \\enspace.\\label{exprcouts4}\\ ] ] again , the situation is quite different for @xmath177 and for @xmath193 . in the first case ,",
    "the current vanishes for @xmath194 and for @xmath195 ; in the intermediate interval , it assumes the constant negative value @xmath196 . due to the conservation equation ,",
    "the two points @xmath197 and @xmath104 are the only points where , at @xmath89 , the time partial derivative @xmath198 is non - zero .",
    "as contrasted , for @xmath173 , the current vanishes everywhere : not only at this time the wavepacket is split off in two fully disconnected parts , but the current between both regions is identically zero since there the wavefunction strictly vanishes .",
    "i mentioned above that , due to the central role of the gauss series given in ( [ psiplusagr ] ) , it is expected that all quantities have a rather rapid and irregular variation in time .",
    "such a fact is illustrated in fig.[psi2court ] , where the probability density and current are plotted for a fixed @xmath1 as functions of time ( remember that for @xmath45 and @xmath87 the densities are the same and the currents have reversed signs ) . at first glance , @xmath28 even looks like a singular function ; remember that @xmath32 is given by a double gauss series . for @xmath143 ,",
    "one has the symmetry @xmath199 .",
    "i shall here follow the same arguments as before , the situation being a bit more complex .",
    "i first introduce four sums @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) corresponding to the values @xmath202 of the dummy summation variable in the series ( [ psiplusagr ] ) .",
    "now , inspection of the time phase factors shows that one has : @xmath203 which has now the form of a gauss _",
    "sum_. for @xmath204 , this gives : @xmath205      \\label{psits8debut}\\enspace.\\ ] ] i now follow the same idea as before , trying to choose definite absciss @xmath156 such that the space factor in ( [ psiplusagr ] ) compensates in some way the dephasing due to the time factor . by trial and error",
    ", it is seen that the proper absciss @xmath156 which allow to express the various sums in terms of the initial wavefunction @xmath206 are @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "first note that the sum @xmath209 is simply equal to the known quantity @xmath210 already introduced in subsection [ persur4 ] . as for the difference @xmath211 , i find the following : @xmath212      \\label{diffsommesxpetit}\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath213      \\label{diffsommesxgrand}\\,.\\ ] ] great care must be exercized when writing the relations between the sums @xmath214 and the values @xmath206 due to the fact that the equality ( [ identities ] ) _ only _ holds for @xmath36 : outside this interval , the wave function vanishes , altough this is not the case for the sums since they are @xmath71-periodic functions .",
    "the above results eventually allow to write the following closed expression for @xmath215 valid for any @xmath78 ( setting @xmath216 for simplicity ) : @xmath217      \\label{psicoupee}\\enspace,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the two functions @xmath218 and @xmath219 are : @xmath220 @xmath221 note that small times give more cusps that larger times ; numerical runs confirm that the initial two cusps propagate through the interval @xmath64 $ ] and multiply at the very beginning of the motion , before reducing in number when the time gets closer to half of a period .    in order to illustrate these results valid for any @xmath78 ,",
    "let me again take @xmath143 ; then , the above formula give for @xmath222 : @xmath223 @xmath224 @xmath225 @xmath226 @xmath227 this respectively gives the expressions for the dimensionless density @xmath228 in the corresponding five intervals : @xmath229 note the _ plateau _ for @xmath230 , and the cusp at @xmath104 , all features which are apparent in fig.[rhoanalts832253 ] where is plotted the density @xmath228 using the preceding formula , and the analytical expression ( [ psicoupee ] ) for the other @xmath78 values .",
    "i checked that they give the same density as that obtained by a numerical calculation using directly the .",
    "coming back to the general @xmath78 case , the expressions ( [ psicoupee ] ) - ( [ fsup ] ) show that @xmath215 _ a priori _ shows up cusps at the following absciss , which i precisely define for further reference : @xmath231 quite remarkably , they are equally spaced , being located at @xmath232 ( @xmath233 ) for @xmath143 ; for @xmath173 , where @xmath234 and @xmath235 merge , the cusp at @xmath236 gets out of the interval @xmath64 $ ] , but the cusp at @xmath237 comes in so that there is still 5 cusps , which all remain in the latter interval for any @xmath78 ( see fig.[abscissescusps ] ) .",
    "i will come back to this in the following subsection .",
    "the current can also be easily computed ; i find : @xmath238      \\label{courantts8inf}\\enspace,\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath239 depend on the considered interval ; for @xmath240 : @xmath241      + \\theta(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}+\\xi)\\theta(1-\\lambda+\\xi ) \\label{c1inf}\\ ] ] and : @xmath242 for @xmath243 , one has : @xmath244      -\\theta(1-\\frac{3\\lambda}{2}+\\xi)\\theta(1-\\lambda+\\xi ) \\label{c1sup}\\ ] ] and : @xmath245 all this shows that @xmath246 is a piecewise constant function , as it must be .",
    "the density and the current are plotted in fig.[psi2cour52 ] from the ( truncated ) series ( [ psiplusagr ] ) for three close times near @xmath247 ; note again the rapid variation of the current . for @xmath248 ,",
    "the current vanishes everywhere .",
    "one sees in figs.[psi2puitsdil2.5 ] and [ psi2puitsdil5.5 ] , which both correspond to @xmath173 , that for @xmath89 , the wavepacket is split into two symmetric parts at the edges of the allowed interval for @xmath1 .",
    "this is true for any @xmath173 , as a consequence of ( [ psi2lt4 ] ) : then , the two intervals @xmath181 $ ] and @xmath182 $ ] do not overlap , so that the density is non - zero only for @xmath14 and @xmath249 ; the two corresponding peaks are identical in shape , each equal to the initial density simply divided by @xmath250 .",
    "it thus turns out that for times @xmath179 ( and @xmath251 ) , the particle is fully localized into narrow domains and can not be found between them .",
    "it can be said that , provided the expanded well has a size large enough , namely greater than @xmath252 , there is the possibility for two identical bumps of width @xmath20 localized at the edges of the box , with no density at all in between .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs for @xmath188 ( and @xmath253 ) : for @xmath248 , the density shows up four identical peaks , each of width @xmath20 .",
    "two of them are at the edges of the interval @xmath64 $ ] , the two others are on each side of the middle of the box .",
    "interestingly enough , the onset of the four peaks occurs at @xmath254 , a threshold at which the cusps are equally spaced ( two couples of them are degenerate because here @xmath255 and @xmath256 ) . once this has happened , the two middle peaks ( `` twin peaks '' ) remain at the fixed distance @xmath20 one from the other when @xmath78 increases , being localized between @xmath257 ( central cusps ) , while the two edge peaks also remain unchanged and are still located between @xmath51 and @xmath20 , and @xmath258 and @xmath22 as @xmath78 varies ( see fig.[rhoanalts8l8gr ] ) .",
    "it thus turns out that for @xmath78 above the critical value @xmath259 , the cusps delineate the regions of vanishing and non - vanishing density : @xmath235 and @xmath260 for the central clusters , @xmath20 and @xmath261 for the ones localized near the boundaries of the box .",
    "again , one can say that when the size is large enough ( now greater than @xmath262 ) , four identical peaks of width @xmath20 can take place as indicated , and are independent of the expansion .    to sum up this discussion",
    ", it can be stated that as far as @xmath78 is greater than @xmath263 , the density @xmath264 is simply obtained by translating several times the initial density @xmath265 according to the formula : @xmath266 where the location of the maxima @xmath267 are @xmath171 , @xmath268 , and @xmath269 .",
    "increasing the expansion factor does not alters the profile of each peak ; the twin peaks stay locked around the center of the box , whereas the edge peaks are getting more and more far away .",
    "remember that above this threshold , the current identically vanishes .",
    "gathering the above the results with those obtained in the @xmath179 case , one can anticipate that for all times of the form @xmath270 , there exists a threshold @xmath271 above which a fragmentation into @xmath272 peaks occurs .",
    "the density profile consists of the elementary pattern @xmath273 $ ] , and its @xmath274 clones translated by @xmath275 ; this is yet to be analytically proved in general , but numerical calculations allow to be convinced that this is true for any @xmath276 ( see fig.[rhots2n20puitsdil ] for an example ) .",
    "all this also confirms that many cusps exist at first times of the @xmath44-periodic motion , but remember that the time unit is precisely the period @xmath277 , so that @xmath278 : large @xmath276 does not mean small times : clearly , the two functions @xmath279 and @xmath93 have no resemblance , although the latter allows to build the former according the above rules .",
    "the above conjectures are done in the continuity of the analytical results given in this paper .",
    "many other statements can be claimed in view of numerical evidence , but they still remain to be proved ; let me give a few of them :    1 .   for all times of the form @xmath280 , @xmath281 integer ,",
    "there exists a threshold @xmath282 above which complete fragmentation occurs .",
    "+ if @xmath281 is even , @xmath283 and one gets a pattern of @xmath284 peaks located as above .",
    "if @xmath281 is odd , fragmentation starts up at @xmath285 , with @xmath281 peaks ; all peaks appear in twins except one , located near the origin .",
    "fragmentation also takes place at times @xmath286 , with @xmath117 integer .",
    "the number of peaks depends on whether @xmath117 and @xmath281 have common divisors or not .",
    "for instance , with @xmath287 , @xmath288 , one finds six peaks if @xmath289 , three peaks if @xmath290 , two peaks if @xmath291 , and a single peak at @xmath160 if @xmath292 ( half - period ) .",
    "the method presented in this paper should be still efficient for proving these ( and other ) statements , although a more elegant procedure is highly wishable in order to make the analysis less cumbersome and more systematic .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "after having focused on these rather outstanding behaviours , let me take the opportunity to add a few things for completeness , some of them being , as far as i know , unquoted in the literature .    as a first by - product",
    ", one can compute the probability @xmath293 to find the energy @xmath39 when achieving a measurement of the energy at a time @xmath26 ; according to one of the postulates of quantum mechanics , one has @xmath294 , namely : @xmath295 if @xmath78 is equal to an integer @xmath79 , the probability @xmath296 can be found from ( [ limitcn0 ] ) , which yields @xmath297 .",
    "when @xmath298 , the distribution of the @xmath299 is ever decreasing as a fonction of @xmath4 ; on the contrary , if @xmath300 , @xmath299 has maximum for @xmath301 , but the probability distribution is quite flat ( see fig.[pnpuitsexpajp ] ) .",
    "this maximum has a clear meaning on physical grounds : there is some kind of resonance in the vicinity of the two states having an energy @xmath39 close to @xmath302 , the initial ( and constant ) value for the average energy .",
    "it can be checked that the expectation value @xmath303 is indeed equal to @xmath302 at any time ( see ) .",
    "note that the variance of the energy is infinite , since the average @xmath304 is given by a diverging series ( @xmath305 , @xmath306 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the prepared state effectively implies a large number of eigenstates @xmath307 because the coefficients @xmath6 have a slowly - decreasing algebraic @xmath4-dependence , so that high energies are relevant .",
    "this yields divergent energy fluctuations .",
    "the expectation values of the position , @xmath308 , and of the momentum , @xmath309 , also display interesting behaviour with time .",
    "an example is given in fig.[x(t)p(t)2 ] ; it is seen that the particle is periodically at rest on the average , since @xmath310 is constant and equal to @xmath235 whereas @xmath309 vanishes .",
    "this means that repeated measurements at those specific times would give exactly the same results as if the particle was in _ any _ stationary state of the dilated well . measuring ( independently ) the energy would actually reveal the true nature of the state , giving for each measure one among all the possible energies @xmath39 .",
    "it is also numerically observed that @xmath308 is bounded by @xmath171 and @xmath269 : the particle , in the average , gets never closer than @xmath171 to the reflecting walls at @xmath73 and @xmath311 .",
    "the product @xmath312 is plotted as a function of time in fig.[dxdp ] .",
    "note that the inverse process  sudden compression of the well , @xmath313  is impossible : one can not instantaneously generate a function vanishing for @xmath314 from a function which is finite in that interval . an infinite well",
    "can only be compressed with a _",
    "finite _ rate ; this case was analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite and@xcite .    as a final remark ,",
    "let me mention that the limit @xmath315 can be achieved from the above formula , and indeed reproduces irreversible propagation in half - infinite space starting from the initial state @xmath19 ; the point is to observe that @xmath25 in ( [ psiplusagr ] ) is a summation on the variable @xmath316 , strictly equivalent to a darboux sum , which quite naturally generates the riemann integral over @xmath317 in this limit ( the differential element @xmath318 arises spontaneously from the factor @xmath319 in front of the summation ) . from ( [ psiplusagr ] )",
    "one can thus write : @xmath320 note that the two zeroes of the denominator are just _ apparent _ singularities .",
    "explicit direct calculation allows to check that such an expression coincides with that obtained directly with the propagator of a free particle in @xmath321 : @xmath322 acting on the initial state @xmath19 to build the state at time @xmath45 according to the standard way , namely @xmath323 . in appendix b ,",
    "i show that the expression ( [ psilambinf ] ) should not lead to misconceptions about the @xmath117-representation of this wavepacket .",
    "as stated from the beginning , this paper just aimed to present a brief review of the rather strange results given above .",
    "although the general existence of the _ plateaux _ is numerically established , i was able up to this point to give only some elements of theoretical explanation , and a genuine proof in the two particular cases @xmath324 .",
    "clearly , further investigation is required in order to provide a general demonstration , and also to define a systematic method for finding the precise points @xmath325 in space - time where such intriguing behaviour takes place .",
    "the fragmentation phenomenon also requires more attention ; at this point , it can be conjectured that for @xmath153 , there exists a critical value @xmath326 above which spontaneous fragmentation occurs into @xmath272 peaks which are the translated _ replica _ of the initial density , divided by @xmath327 ; i gave an analytical proof only for @xmath328 , but numerical evidence allows to be convinced that this is a general result . for @xmath329 ,",
    "the density is an ordered finite lattice of adjacent bumps .",
    "it can not be excluded that more complex patterns could be realized , going beyond the simple organization observed for @xmath153 , although numerical calculations for times of the form @xmath286 ( @xmath117 and @xmath281 integers ) have , until now , unveiled spatial organization having the simple features described above .",
    "last but not least , a transparent physical interpretation would be welcome , allowing to get physical insight explaining such amazing and counterintuitive behaviours .",
    "work in these directions is in progress and , hopefully , will be published in the near future .",
    "i here show how to check that the state @xmath25 given by eq.([psiplusagr ] ) is actually normalized to unity , and that the expectation value of the energy is indeed equal to @xmath302 for any time , as it must be on physical grounds since no work is done on the particle when the well is suddenly expanded .",
    "let us consider the function @xmath330 defined as follows ( @xmath78 not an integer ) : @xmath331 this series is uniformly convergent for any real @xmath332 , so that @xmath333 is a continuous function .",
    "on the other hand , derivatives of @xmath334 obviously contain generalized functions ( the unit - step function and its derivatives ) .",
    "one readily sees that the definition ( [ defgbetat ] ) allows to write : @xmath335\\right)_{\\phi=\\pi/\\lambda }       \\enspace.\\label{normegbetat}\\ ] ]    let us now find @xmath336 , which is an even @xmath337-periodic function of the variable @xmath332 . by differentiating twice the definition ( [ defgbetat ] ) ,",
    "one obtains a linear combination of the function @xmath334 itself and of a dirac comb .",
    "this means that the non - singular part of @xmath334 precisely satisfies the differential equation @xmath338 for any @xmath3390,\\,\\pi/2[$ ] ; the general solution is @xmath340 .",
    "the two constants @xmath341 and @xmath342 can be found by using the known equalities ( mittag - lffler expansions ) : @xmath343 @xmath344 which yield @xmath345 and @xmath346 , so that eventually : @xmath347 as anticipated above , @xmath336 is a continuous function of @xmath332 , but its first derivative has a jump at @xmath348 , explaining the presence of the dirac comb in the complete second - order differential equation for @xmath336 .",
    "using now the rule expressed in ( [ normegbetat ] ) , one readily gets @xmath349 .    as for the average of the energy ,",
    "one has : @xmath350-       \\hspace{60pt}\\nonumber       \\\\",
    "\\hspace{120pt } \\frac{\\lambda^{2}e_{1}}{2\\pi^{2 } }       \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda }       \\left[g(\\lambda,\\,0)-g(\\lambda,\\,\\phi ) \\right]\\right)_{\\phi=\\pi/\\lambda }       \\enspace;\\label{moyegbetat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity in the brackets of the first line vanishes since it is proportional to @xmath351 ; due to ( [ normegbetat ] ) , one is eventually left with @xmath352 confirming that the expectation value of energy @xmath353 is equal to @xmath302 at all times negative or positive , as it must be .",
    "i here intend to draw attention on a serious misconsception which could arise in view of the expression ( [ psilambinf ] ) . in order to make the discussion easier , i rewrite the latter as follows : @xmath354 where the function @xmath355 is : @xmath356 where @xmath357 . at first sight , it looks obvious to claim that @xmath358 is the @xmath117-representation of the initial state , while the time - dependent exponential in the integral in ( [ psilambinfbis ] ) is just the ordinary phase factor for the free particle starting in the @xmath359 state at initial time . as apparently trivial as it stands ,",
    "this statement is simply wrong . in order to show this ,",
    "let us draw a few consequences of it .",
    "first , it is easy to calculate the integral @xmath360 ; one finds that it is equal to @xmath250 , instead of 1 .",
    "second , the true @xmath117-representation of the initial state can be easily and unambiguously calculated according to @xmath361 , and turns out to be : @xmath362 aside the fact that it comes out properly normalized to unity since @xmath93 is , the function @xmath363 is frankly different from the function @xmath358 given in ( [ philambinfaux ] ) .",
    "another drawback is that , due to standard rules of quantum mechanics for @xmath117-representation , the expectation value of the coordinate is : @xmath364      \\label{xmoyenfaux}\\enspace.\\ ] ] since @xmath358 is an odd function of @xmath117 , the integral vanishes , giving @xmath365 , which is clearly incorrect : the wavepacket moves ( and spreads out ) in the free half - infinite space as time goes on . on the other hand , a non - vanishing integral",
    "would give a purely imaginaly expectation value since @xmath358 is a real - valued function , up to a constant phase .",
    "the error comes from the fact that everything stands in @xmath366 , instead of @xmath367 . in other words , when a function @xmath98 arises as a fourier integral of the form : @xmath368 the equality holds true only for @xmath369 and one must not conclude at a glance ( although this could happen to be correct ) that the function @xmath370 is the fourier transform of @xmath98 : since all this holds true only if @xmath369 , and assuming that the jordan s lemma is applicable , one can add to @xmath370 any function @xmath371 which is analytic in the complex upper half - plane without changing the integral in the rhs of ( [ mifourier ] ) ; the difference between @xmath358 and @xmath363 is actually such a function ( remember that @xmath372 are apparent singularities ) . in other words , although the fourier transformation @xmath373 is unambiguous , any intervening fourier integral must be cautiously interpreted before to claim this is just the fourier inversion formula ; unconsidered intuitive identification can give incorrect results .",
    "remind that for such functions defined in @xmath366 , the laplace transformation is a much more secure method to proceed .",
