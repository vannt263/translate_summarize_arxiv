    "quantum interferometers based on low - dimensional electronic nanosystems proved to be very powerful tools in studying coherent mesoscopic phenomena @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of such an interferometer is a _ single - channel ballistic _ quantum ring tunnel - coupled to leads and threaded by the magnetic flux @xmath0 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the dependence of the conductance of this setup @xmath1 on @xmath0 encodes important information about the phase coherence of the tunneling electrons .",
    "in particular , the interference of electron waves , propagating in the ring clockwise and counterclockwise , results in the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations @xcite of @xmath1 with @xmath0 .",
    "the oscillation period is given by the flux quantum @xmath2    = 5.0 cm    the shape and amplitude of the ab oscillations depend essentially on the strength of the tunneling coupling and on the relation between the temperature @xmath3 and the level spacing in the ring @xmath4 for @xmath5 and weak tunneling coupling there are narrow resonant peaks in the dependence @xmath6.@xcite the positions of the peaks depend on the electron fermi energy @xcite and the strength of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "remarkably , the interference effects are not entirely suppressed by thermal averaging , and the resonant behavior of @xmath6 survives for the case @xmath7 specifically , the high - temperature conductance of the noninteracting ring with weak tunnel coupling to the contacts exhibits sharp antiresonances at @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dimensionless flux and @xmath10 is an arbitrary integer number ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "@xcite the electron - electron interaction leads to appearance of a fine structure of the antiresonances : each antiresonance splits into a series of narrow peaks , whose widths are governed by dephasing .",
    "@xcite    the question which we address in this paper is the role of the spin - orbit ( so ) and zeeman interaction in the high - temperature tunneling transport through the _ ballistic single - channel _ ring with noninteracting electrons .",
    "the effect of the so interaction on the properties of one - dimensional ( 1d ) and quasi one - dimensional systems , in particular 1d quantum wires and rings , has attracted much attention.@xcite it is known that in a 1d noninteracting wire with an arbitrary spatial dependence of the spin - orbit coupling , the spin degree of freedom may be excluded by a unitary transformation.@xcite however , this is not the case for a multiply - connected 1d system such as a single - channel quantum ring .",
    "though such a ring is actually a 1d system , the interference between spin parts of two counter - propagating electron waves makes the problem less trivial .",
    "indeed , the rotation of electron spin in the built - in so magnetic field results in a spin phase shift between clockwise and counterclockwise waves , which is a manifestation of the aharonov - casher ( ac ) effect.@xcite the ac phase is the spin analog of the orbital ab phase .",
    "more precisely , the ac phase is additional with respect to ab phase and exists even at zero external magnetic field ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "an important consequence is the existence of the ac oscillations of zero - field conductance @xmath12 with the strength of the so coupling .",
    "the ac oscillations were intensively discussed theoretically @xcite and their signatures were observed experimentally.@xcite another consequence , especially important from the point of view of possible applications , is that the unpolarized incoming electron beam acquires polarization after passing through the ring , so that the ring may serve as a spin polarizer . the latter effect was recently discussed in a number of publications @xcite mostly concerned with the study of the zero - temperature case .",
    "the finite temperature effects were also analyzed on the basis of numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite    here , we develop an analytical theory of the spin - dependent transport through a ballistic single - channel ring with two symmetric contacts focusing on the high temperature case , @xmath13 .",
    "it will be shown that the spin - selective properties of the discussed setup survive thermal averaging .",
    "we will see that the so interaction ( in the absence of the zeeman coupling ) leads to the splitting of the high - temperature conductance antiresonances ( fig .",
    "2 ) into two dips ( fig .",
    "4a ) , the distance between dips being proportional to the ac phase . in the vicinities of the dips",
    "the tunneling electrons acquire polarization @xmath14 [ see fig .",

    "the vector @xmath14 lies in the @xmath15 plane formed by two axes : the axis @xmath16 which connects contacts @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the axial symmetry axis of the ring ( @xmath19 axis perpendicular to the ring s plane ) . at zero external field ( @xmath20 )",
    "the conductance @xmath12 exhibits series of sharp ac antiresonances [ see eq .  ] .",

    "( i ) emergence of additional antiresonances in @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; ( ii ) appearance of nonzero polarization in @xmath23 direction .",
