    "aberration and retardation effects ( a / r hereafter ) can be observed in a pulsar profile as a shift of the position of conal components with respect to the core component towards earlier longitudinal phases ( see for e.g. malov & suleimanova ( 1998 ) , gangadhara & gupta 2001 , g&ga hereafter ) .",
    "such effects should occur if different components are emitted at different distances from the pulsar surface ( emission radii ) , as well as from the pulsar spin axis .",
    "aberration is caused by bending of radiation beam due to the polar cap rotation , while retardation is based on a path difference for radiation from different conal emission regions to reach an observer .",
    "if we assume that the emission from the core component arises relatively close to the star surface , then it should not be strongly affected by either of the two above mentioned effects .",
    "this will be our initial assumption .    to determine a / r shifts the pulsar profile has to meet certain requirements .",
    "it has to be a high resolution profile with high signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "the core and the conal components have to be clearly identified within the profile .",
    "multifrequency data is recommended , so one can follow the profile evolution throughout all frequencies , which can help to identify different emission components .",
    "when values of a / r shifts are determined , then the heights of the radiation emission region ( emission altitudes hereafter ) can be calculated ( see g&ga and dyks et .",
    "al 2004 ) .",
    "it is believed that at different frequencies the emission arises at different heights above the pulsar surface ( kijak & gil 1998 , 2003 and mitra & rankin 2002 ) .",
    "the results of this analysis can be used to verify the existence of a radius  to  frequency mapping .",
    "all observational limits for emission altitude hence can be crucial for understanding the physical mechanism of generation of pulsar coherent radio emission .",
    "the relativistic beaming model initially proposed by blaskiewicz , cordes & wasserman ( 1991 , bcw hereafter ) clearly demonstrated that aberration and retardation effects play an important role in pulsars .",
    "this study was primarily based on evidence which followed from the effects of a / r as seen in the inflexion point of the pulsar s polarisation position angle ( hereafter pa ) traverse , which lags the midpoint of the total intensity profile centre .",
    "a similar effect of a / r was reported by g&ga and gupta & gangadhara ( 2003 , g&gb hereafter ) in a handful of pulsars where the core emission was seen to lag behind the profile centre .    in this paper",
    "we have undertaken a careful study to establish the a / r effect observed by g&ga and g&gb for a large sample of pulsars observed at multiple frequencies .",
    "most of the data are new observations from the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt hereafter ) and the arecibo observatory ( ao hereafter ) .",
    "we have also used some archival data from the european pulsar network ( epn hereafter ) archive . in section  ( [ sec2 ] )",
    "we discuss various methods used to find emission heights in pulsars , in section  ( [ sec3 ] ) we discuss various factors affecting a / r measurements in pulsars and section  ( [ sec4 ] ) deals with the observation and data analysis methods used in this paper .    as a result of our analysis presented in section  ( [ sec5 ] )",
    "we found that out of 23 pulsars in our sample 7 clearly show the a / r effect , 12 show a clear tendency towards this effect , while the remaining 4 are counter examples .",
    "however , as argued in section  ( [ sec3 ] ) , all problematic cases ( pulsar profiles at all or some frequencies not showing the a / r effect ) can be attributed to a number of effects like incorrect identification of the core component or missing conal emission .",
    "we can conclude that a / r effects are seen to operate in pulsars , which we discuss in section  ( [ sec6 ] ) .",
    "radio emission heights in pulsars are primarily obtained by two methods ; the geometrical method and heights estimation based on a / r effects . here",
    "we briefly mention the essential ingredients of the methods used , and a detailed discussion of the various methods used can be found in mitra & li ( 2004 ) .",
    "radio emission geometry is determined by several parameters : @xmath0  an inclination angle of the magnetic dipole with respect to the rotation axis , @xmath1  the minimum angle between an observer s line of sight and magnetic axis ( impact angle ) , @xmath2  an opening angle of the radio emission beam , @xmath3  a radial distance of the radio emission region measured from the centre of the neutron star ( emission altitude ) .",
    "the opening angle @xmath2 of the pulsar beam corresponding to the pulse width @xmath4 is given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 are measured in degrees ( gil et al .",
    "the opening angle @xmath2 is the angle between the pulsar magnetic axis and the tangent to magnetic field lines at points where the emission corresponding to the apparent pulse width @xmath4 originates . for dipolar",
    "field lines : @xmath7 ( gil & kijak 1993 ) , where @xmath8 is a mapping parameter which describes the locus of corresponding field lines on the polar cap ( @xmath9 at the pole and @xmath10 at the edge of the polar cap ) , @xmath11 is the distance of the given magnetic open field line from the dipolar magnetic axis ( in cm ) , @xmath12 is the polar cap radius ( in cm ) and @xmath13 is the pulsar period in seconds .",
    "the radio emission altitude can be obtained using eqn .",
    "( [ rho ] ) :    @xmath14    in this equation parameter @xmath10 is used which corresponds to the bundle of last open magnetic field lines .",
    "kijak and gil ( 1997 ) also derived a semi  empirical formula for emission height which was slightly modified by kijak & gil ( 2003 ) by using larger number of pulsars and broadening the frequency coverage in their analysis .",
    "they estimated the emission heights for a number of pulsars at several frequencies using the geometrical method ( eqs . [ rho_1 ] and [ r_geo ] ) based on the above assumption that the low intensity pulsar radiation ( corresponding to the profile wings ) is emitted tangentially to the bundle of the last open dipolar field lines . in the method",
    ", they used low ",
    "intensity pulse width data at about 0.01 % of the maximum intensity ( kijak & gil 1997 and kijak & gil 2003 ) .",
    "the most recent formula has a form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is observing frequency in ghz and @xmath17 is the period derivative .",
    "the formula @xmath18 sets lower and upper boundaries for emission height values in the statistical sense .    for calculating the emission heights one can take a different approach .",
    "the a / r effects have been observed in the total intensity profiles as discussed by malov & suleimanova ( 1998 ) , g&ga , g&gb , dyks et al ( 2004 ) . in turn , they have been used to calculate radio emission heights .",
    "observationally the a / r effects are obtained by measuring the positions of the conal emission components and identifying the central core emission component .",
    "the shape of the observed profile depends on the structure of radio beam , which is thought to be composed of a central core emission surrounded by nested cones ( rankin 1983 , mitra & deshpande 1999 ) .",
    "the line of sight passing through the central region of this beam will hence cut the cone emission at the edges including the central core region . following this ,",
    "pulsar profiles can be classified due to the number and type of visible components ( rankin 1983 ) .",
    "if we assume that in a certain profile the core component and both the conal components are present , we can define the phase difference : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are phase positions ( in degrees ) of the peaks of the leading and trailing components with respect to the core phase ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "following the refinement of g&ga by dyks et al .",
    "( 2004 ) one can estimate the radio emission altitude and @xmath1 , and the corrections in obtaining emission heights turns out to be of the order of 2% to 10% for normal pulsars .",
    "we have however not used this formula since all the pulsars in our sample are normal pulsars and , further , the error in estimating emission heights are often more than 10% . ] : @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is speed of light ) is the light cylinder radius .",
    "the a / r method has an edge over the geometrical method since it only depends weakly on the geometrical angles of the star which are difficult to find .",
    "generally the emission altitudes found using both these methods are of the order of few hundred kilometers above the surface of the neutron star . in this paper",
    "we use equation ( [ r_del ] ) for estimating emission altitudes following the method outlined by g&ga .",
    "the various factors affecting usage of this method are discussed in section ( [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "the crucial aspect for estimating radio emission heights using the a / r technique is to identify the location of the meridional plane i.e. the plane containing the magnetic axis and the pulsar rotation axis .",
    "generally polarisation observations have been used to identify the meridional plane as per the rotating vector model ( rvm ) proposed by radhakrishnan & cooke ( 1969 ) . according to the rvm the variation of the pa of the linear polarisation across the pulse reflects the underlying structure of the dipolar magnetic field if one is located on the pulsar frame . in this case the steepest gradient or the inflexion point of the pa traverse is the point contained in the meridional plane , and should be coincident with the midpoint of the pulse profile .",
    "however in the observers frame , as was pointed out by bcw , dyks et al ( 2004 ) , the a / r effects causes the pa inflexion point to appear delayed w.r.t .",
    "the midpoint of the pulse profile .",
    "the magnitude of the delay is proportional to the height of emission from the neutron star surface and inversely proportional to the pulsar period .",
    "hence in the observer s plane the inflexion point of the pa traverse is no longer the point containing the meridional plane , rather the meridional plane lies somewhere in between the profile midpoint and the inflexion point of the pa traverse .",
    "we use the method employed by g&ga , b to find emission heights due to a / r effects using eq .",
    "if the mid  point of the outer conal peaks leads the core peak , it would imply that the conal emission is higher than the core emission and the shift can be used to find emission heights w.r.t .",
    "this argument however assumes that the meridional plane passes through the peak of the core emission .",
    "while this assumption is not rigorously verified , there are few pulsars which have been used to justify this argument .",
    "one such pulsar is psr b1857@xmath2626 ( see fig .",
    "[ b1857 ] ) where the peak of the core , the inflexion point and the sign changing circular , are all close to each other ( see mitra & rankin 2008 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "if one assumes that the core emission is curvature radiation which fills the full polar cap as was suggested by rankin ( 1990 ) , then the meridional plane would lie in the plane containing the inflexion point , peak of the core and sign changing circular .",
    "although a critical look at psr b1857@xmath2626 reveals that the peak of the core is delayed by a degree or so w.r.t .",
    "the inflexion point ( see mitra & rankin 2008 ) .",
    "mitra & li ( 2004 ) have shown that for a few other pulsars the peak of the core lags the inflexion point by about a degree .",
    "the shifts expected due to a / r effects for slow pulsars are also often small ( e.g. for emission altitude of 300 km and a 0.7 sec pulsar , the expected shift is of the order of a degree ) and is comparable to core shifts seen w.r.t . the inflexion point .",
    "hence , it is important to note that to demonstrate the a / r effects as suggested by g&ga and g&gb , the meridional plane should pass through the peak of the core emission ( which is currently not verified ) and the conal emission should be rising higher than the core emission .",
    "identification of the core emission is not trivial in pulsars . under the core ",
    "cone model of pulsar beaming the core is centrally located and surrounded by nested cones .",
    "this implies that the core is located in the centre of a pulse profile , which is very close to the inflexion point of the pa .",
    "since the impact parameter needs to be small to cut through the core emission region in a pulsar , the corresponding pa traverse as per the rvm should show a significant rotation across the pulse .",
    "core emission is often associated with a sign changing circular polarisation and has a steeper spectral index than the conal emission .",
    "there are situations where several core like emission characteristics are seen in a pulse component .",
    "for example in fig ( [ b1831 ] ) psr b1831@xmath2604 has a bright central component which is identified as core emission by rankin ( 1993a , 1993b ) .",
    "this component has a steep spectral index and a sign changing circular as seen in gould & lyne s ( 1998 , gl98 hereafter ) multi  frequency polarisation profiles .",
    "on the other hand the pa traverse is flat , showing no significant rotation ( except 90@xmath27 jumps ) and the profile is extremely wide ( @xmath28 150@xmath27 ) .",
    "such emission properties are consistent with the observer crossing the pulsar emission beam along the conal emission zone and the observer is likely to miss the core emission .",
    "hence for psr b1831@xmath2604 , the bright centrally located component can be interpreted as conal emission rather than core emission .",
    "further there are situations where the pa below the core emission can deviate from the rvm model ( see mitra , rankin & gupta 2007 ) , and hence the location of the inflexion point is difficult to determine .",
    "a careful examination using multi  frequency single pulse polarisation data is hence essential to find the location of the core emission . for our data set",
    "we have used the gl98 polarisation data sets wherever possible to find the location of the core emission which we discuss in the appendix . however incorrect identification of the core",
    "would clearly affect demonstration of the a / r effect .    in several cases",
    "the central emission close to the core is weaker compared to the outer cones",
    ". methods employed to find the peak of the core ( like the gaussian fitting scheme discussed in section [ sec4 ] ) have problems in establishing the location of the core component ( like psr b1738@xmath2608 ) , and hence cause complication in discerning the a / r effect .",
    "subpulse modulation ( or drifting ) provides another means to identify core and conal components in pulsars .",
    "the conal components tends to show subpulse drifting seen as a spectral feature in phase resolved fluctuation spectra , while in the core emission this phenomenon is generally absent ( rankin 1986 ) .",
    "it is sometimes possible that the central component of the pulsar shows drifting properties , in which case the central component can not be core emission .",
    "we have verified our sample pulsars for such drifting of the central component based on the dataset of pulsar subpulse modulation published by weltevrede et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "three pulsars from our sample show central component modulation feature out of which two pulsars psr b1508 + 55 and b1917 + 00 has a broad modulation feature which is consistent with core emission , while psr b1944 + 17 shows clear drifting properties making this pulsar unsuitable for a / r analysis .      in several pulsars",
    "only a part of the emission cone is visible and these pulsars were identified as partial cones by lyne & manchester ( 1988 ) .",
    "the pa inflexion point in these pulsars lies towards one edge of the profile .",
    "this kind of pulsar however poses a problem for finding the a / r effect , since estimation of the midpoint of the total intensity profile is incorrect due to missing emission .",
    "one such example in our sample is perhaps psr b1859 + 03 as shown in fig ( [ b1859 ] ) .",
    "the pa inflexion point coincides with the peak of the trailing component and has a sign changing circular , which is suggestive of core emission , however there is no emission component seen in the trailing part of the profile .",
    "single pulse study by mitra , rankin & sarala ( 2008 ) recently has shown that the missing partial cone regions occasionally flare up , and these flared profiles can be used to demonstrate the a / r effect .    26 polarisation profile .",
    "the upper panel of the plot shows the intensity ( solid line ) , linear polarisation ( dotted line ) and the circular polarisation ( dashed line ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the pa with error bars .",
    "this profile is an example where the core component , the inflection point and the sign changing circular are close to each other ( see section 3 for details).,height=245 ]    04 polarisation profile ( same as in fig  [ b1857 ] ) .",
    "although this pulsar shows the sign change in circular it has a flat pa and a wide profile . hence it is likely that the central bright emission component is not a core ( see section 3 for details),height=245 ]    ) .",
    "this pulsar has a clear sign changing circular indicating the location of the core emission .",
    "however the emission towards the trailing parts of the profile seems to be missing ( see section 3 for details).,height=245 ]",
    "for our analysis we selected profiles of 28 pulsars from three sources ( see table [ tabelapulsarow ] ) : gmrt , ao and epn .",
    "the gmrt ( swarup et al . 1991 ) operating at meter wavelengths is an array of 30 antennas with alt ",
    "az mounts , each of 45 meter diameter , spread out over a 25 km region located 80 km north of pune , india .",
    "it is designed to operate at multiple frequencies ( 150 , 235 , 325 , 610 and 1000  1450 mhz respectively ) having a maximum bandwidth of 32 mhz split into upper and lower sidebands of 16 mhz each .",
    "it is primarily an aperture synthesis interferometer as well as a phased array instrument .",
    "the gmrt observations reported in this paper are done in the phased array mode of operation at rf 225 and 325 mhz , respectively , using the upper side band and a bandwidth of 16 mhz . in the phased array mode of the gmrt ( sirothia , s. 2000 ,",
    "gupta et al . 2000 ) , signals from any selected set of the antennas are added together after an appropriate delay and phase compensation to synthesise a single , larger antenna with a narrower beam .",
    "signals of 16 mhz from each side band of each antenna are available across 256 channels which can be summed in the gmrt array combiner .",
    "the summed voltage signal output from the phased array is then processed like any other single dish telescope signal , by the pulsar backend . at the frequencies of interest here , gmrt has two linearly polarised outputs for each antenna which are further mixed in a quadrature hybrid to produce two circular polarised signals which go further into the front end electronics and rest of the signal chain .",
    "the raw signals are finally post integrated by the pulsar backend and the data was recorded with the final sampling time of 0.512 msec . the time resolution for all the analysis done in this paper is the pulsar period divided by the sampling time .",
    "all the pulsars were observed for about 2000 pulse periods to obtain stable pulse profiles . the off  line analysis involved interference rejection , dedispersion and folding to obtain the average pulse profiles .",
    "the ao data set is from observations at the arecibo observatory , carried out between december 2001 and june 2002 .",
    "the pulsars were observed at different frequencies using the following receivers : 430 mhz , l  band ( 1175 mhz ) , s  low ( 2250 mhz ) , s  high ( 3500 mhz ) , c  band ( 48505000 mhz ) .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our analysis followed these steps : ( 1 ) identification of core components in profiles .",
    "we have used several established methods for discriminating the core components : ( i ) quasi  centrality of the component flanked by one or two pairs of conal components , ( ii ) associating the core component with the inflexion point of the polarisation position angle traverse and sense  reversing signature of circular polarisation under the core component ( although the polarimetry was not always available in our data ) , ( 2 ) identification of conal pairs as leading and trailing components , primarily based on symmetric location of components on either side of the core one , ( 3 ) estimation of phase shifts according to eqn .",

    "( [ r_del ] ) .",
    "this simple procedure is not always straightforward in practice .",
    "there are cases when components merge ( especially as a function of the observing frequency ) and their positions are not clearly determined . in these cases we decided to use a gaussian fitting method introduced by kramer et .",
    "al ( 1994 ) . for consistency",
    ", we applied this method to all our profiles , even those in which all components were clearly distinguishable .",
    "the gaussian fitting procedure was as follows : fix gaussian parameters of identifiable components ( position , amplitude , width ) , put additional gaussian with some initial parameters and allow the fitting method to find the best position , amplitudes and widths . for detailed information about gaussian fitting method",

    "al ( 1994 ) .",
    "after applying this method to unresolved components we obtained a full and consistent set of component positions to be used in further analysis .",

    "we think that the central component in this pulsar might be incorrectly identified as the core emission ( as discussed in section 3 ) .",
    "the flat pa traverse seems to suggest that the line of sight is not cutting the overall beam centrally ( see another example of broad profile pulsar b0826@xmath2634 discussed by gupta , gil , kijak et al .",

    "if this is the case then the central component could arise from grazing the third , innermost cone of emission , although its non - central location is a concern in this model .",

    "the three other counter ",
    "examples b1738@xmath2608 , b1848 + 04 and b1859 + 03 show a marginal deviation from the a / r effects and are probably also related to our inability of identifying the location of the core component . in the first case ( b1738@xmath2608 ) the core component is not apparent ,",
    "although a blind gaussian fitting method indicates a central  core \" component ( see fig .",

    "a.4 in the on  line appendix ) is a clear example of a pulsars with missing component ( in this case the trailing one ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude , that all 4 cases of strong counter  examples reported are the result of mis  identification of the core component .",
    "sometimes weak conal emission or merged conal components leads to wrong identification of the emission components .",
    "for example in psr b1541 + 09 the leading conal component at 1225 and 2330 mhz is difficult to model . in cases like psr b1944 + 17 and b1737 + 13",
    "the weak conal emission poses difficulties in determining the location of the components .",
    "it is likely that the same set of problems occur in the group of doubtful cases ( i.e. pulsars which show a / r effects at some frequencies but not in others ) .",
    "this strengthens our general conclusions that a / r effects are apparent in pulsar profiles .    in cases where a / r effects are seen between the core and conal components in pulsars , implies that the core emission necessarily has to originate closer to the stellar surface than the conal emission ( see for e.g. g&ga , dyks et al .",
    "the delay emission heights obtained by eqn .",
    "( [ r_del ] ) are essentially the conal emission heights with respect to the core emission .",
    "alternatively geometrical methods can be used to find the conal emission height @xmath18 as specified by eqn .",
    "( [ rkg ] ) . a comparison between the conal emission heights measured by these two methods is shown in fig .",
    "( [ r_em_plot ] ) .",
    "this plot can be compared to fig .",
    "( 29 ) of bcw where a similar effect is noted , although the delay heights there were measured from polarisation observations and they used log  log axes . in this figure",
    "the clear a / r cases are marked with filled circles , doubtful cases are marked with open circles and the so called counter  examples are marked with stars .",
    "note that many of the negative @xmath30 values , in fig .",
    "( [ r_em_plot ] ) correspond to the counter ",
    "examples in our sample .",
    "it is noteworthy that statistically the relation @xmath42 seems to hold well .",
    "there are primarily two reasons which can explain this effect .",
    "firstly the @xmath30 values can be underestimated if the putative core emission arises from a definite height above the polar cap . in order to square the two height estimates by making the cluster of points in fig .",
    "( [ r_em_plot ] ) to be located on the 45@xmath43 line , a nominal average core emission height of about 100 km is needed .",
    "alternatively , the geometrical emission height @xmath18 might be overestimated , since the assumption prevailing in estimating these heights is that the measured widths entail the last open field lines , i.e. @xmath44 ( see eqn .",
    "[ rho ] ) .",
    "if the parameter @xmath45 was around 0.7 , the two height estimates would square with each other . as discussed by mitra & li ( 2004 ) , a careful and systematic study of the relation of the core emission w.r.t .",
    "the polarisation position angle traverse might help to resolve this issue .    .",
