    "the emphasis in this work is on the latter situation and we investigate the effect of the ev interaction on the depletion interaction between two parallel walls as compared to the case of confined ideal chains .    by focusing on _ long _ flexible chains in a system of mesoscopic size",

    "@xcite and @xcite ( see in particular fig.@xmath102 in ref.@xcite ) it is stated that the total force @xmath103 between the two walls is repulsive and diverges in the narrow slit limit , i.e. , @xmath104 where @xmath105 for ideal chains and @xmath106 for chains with ev interaction and @xmath107 is the radius of gyration of the polymer chain in unbounded space @xcite . [ for the definition of @xmath107 see eqs.([seqd2 ] ) and ( [ eqd2 ] ) in sec.[sec_exp ] . ]",
    "the qualitative difference to the scaling function @xmath108 presented for the force in subsec.[sec_pma ] is explained by the following arguments .",
    "( a ) the total force between the walls is repulsive due to the contribution from the cost in free energy caused by the loss of the total available space for the polymer chains within the slit , i.e. , the bulk pressure @xmath109 contributes to the total force .",
    "( b ) the total force @xmath101 diverges due to the change from the grand canonical to the canonical ensemble ( see subsec.[sec_can ] ) . in the simulation in ref.@xcite the number @xmath44 of polymers in the slit",
    "is given by one polymer in the slit volume .",
    "therefore we obtain the total force @xmath101 by differentiating eq.([fvni ] ) with respect to the slit width @xmath6 and by setting @xmath110 , i.e. , @xmath111 where @xmath112 is given by the rhs of eq.([gsep ] ) in conjunction with eqs.([fseps ] ) and ( [ deltafeps ] ) in appendix [ sec_app ] .",
    "the lhs of eq.([force ] ) corresponds to the quantity @xmath113 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure[figsim ] shows the comparison of the simulation data of ref.@xcite and the corresponding theoretical result from eq.([force ] ) , the latter both for ideal chains and chains with ev interaction .",
    "note that the theoretical curve for chains with ev interaction is only valid for large @xmath114 .",
    "the curve for chains with ev interaction is closer to the simulation data than the curve for ideal chains , in agreement with the fact that the polymer chain in the simulation is a self - avoiding one .",
    "one possible reason for the remaining deviation might be that the chain in the simulation is too short to be fully described by the present field - theoretical approach . the deviation of the monte carlo simulation data at large values of @xmath114 from the power - law behavior at small values of @xmath114 ( dashed line ) occurs because @xmath115 tends to @xmath116 for large @xmath114 , which is not captured by eq.([narrowsl ] ) .",
    "figures @xmath117 of ref.@xcite show density profiles for the simulated chains with ev interaction , including a comparison with the analytical result for the profile of ideal chains in the slit ( fig.9 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we want to mention here that the field - theoretical treatment of the monomer density for chains with ev interaction requires a perturbation expansion involving integrals over @xmath118 instead of @xmath119 ( see appendix[sec_app ] ) and thus in view of the technical challenges is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "alternative information about the monomer density profiles beyond the ideal behavior can be found in ref.@xcite in which a self - consistent mean - field approximation is used to obtain the monomer density profiles for a single polymer chain between two repulsive walls .",
    "rudhardt , bechinger , and leiderer @xcite have measured the depletion interaction between a wall and a colloidal particle immersed in a dilute solution of nonionic polymer chains in a good solvent by means of total internal reflection microscopy ( tirm ) .",
    "they monitored the fluctuations of the relative distance of the colloid particle from the wall induced by brownian motion . from the resulting boltzmann distribution",
    "one can infer the corresponding effective depletion potential between the repulsive wall and the particle .    in order to compare these experimental data with our results",
    "we apply the derjaguin approximation @xcite . in the limit that the radius @xmath120 of the spherical particle is much larger than both @xmath121 and",
    "the distance @xmath122 of closest approach surface - to - surface between the particle and the wall , the particle can be regarded as composed of a pile of fringes .",
    "each fringe builds a fringe - like slit with distance @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the radius of the fringe .",
    "thus the interaction between the particle and the wall is given by @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a dimensionless variable and @xmath99 is the scaling function for the free energy of interaction for the slit geometry [ see eq.([theta ] ) ] .    in ref.@xcite",
    "the interaction potential @xmath127 is measured for nonionic polymer chains in a good solvent for polymer number densities @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "all these polymer number densities represent a _ dilute _ polymer solution so that @xmath127 is a linear function of @xmath42 [ see eq.([felog ] ) ] .",
    "therefore our results are applicable and fig.[figexp ] shows @xmath133 as a function of @xmath122 .",
    "the crosses in fig.[figexp ] correspond to those values of @xmath122 for which the above mentioned linear behavior @xmath134 ( not shown ) is in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "deviations from the linear behavior @xmath134 for small and large particle - wall distances @xmath122 ( not shown ) can be explained by the experimental method tirm used in ref.@xcite : a higher interaction potential implies a lower probability to find the particle at the corresponding distance causing lower accuracy .",
    "it turns out that the total interaction potential as the sum of depletion potential , electrostatic repulsion , and gravity is highest for short and large distances , which are those where the linear relationship @xmath134 is not confirmed experimentally .",
    "figure[figexp ] also shows the corresponding theoretical predictions for the experimental data , both for ideal polymer chains and chains with ev interaction , i.e. , chains in a good solvent as realized in the experiment .",
    "note that all parameters entering these theoretical predictions are _ fixed _ by available experimental data for @xmath42 , @xmath122 , and @xmath107 , i.e. , there are no freely adjustable parameters . in particular , the radius of gyration @xmath107 of the polymer chains used in ref.@xcite has been measured fairly accurately by means of small angle scattering of x - rays @xcite , resulting in @xmath135 . according to the definition of @xmath107",
    "as measured in small angle scattering experiments @xcite , i.e. , @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the monomer density , in @xmath14 one has @xcite",
    "@xmath138    figure[figexp ] shows that the experimental data of ref.@xcite deviate from the theoretical result derived here .",
    "note that this deviation is not visible if the polymer size is used as a freely adjustable parameter in order to gain agreement between the experimental and theoretical data .",
    "the theoretical curve for chains with ev interaction , as realized in the experiment , is even _ further away _ from the experimental data than the theoretical curve for ideal chains .",
    "the latter observation confirms the necessity of reinterpreting of the experimental data , e.g. , by adjusting the radius of gyration .",
    "this can be done such that agreement with the theoretical data for chains with ev interaction is gained for the intermediate values of the distance where the linear relationship @xmath134 allows for a direct comparison with the theory .",
    "[ the remaining differences outside this intermediate regime ( @xmath139 ) pose a separate issue as discussed in the paragraph following eq.([derj ] ) .",
    "] however the difference between the two theoretical curves for ideal chains and chains with ev interaction is small compared to the deviation from the experimental data .",
    "any attempt to use the monte carlo data obtained in ref.@xcite for predicting the depletion interaction between a colloidal particle and a wall would require two integrations of @xmath101 and a change to the grand canonical ensemble , which poses prohibitive accuracy problems . nonetheless a qualitative statement can be given easily .",
    "figure[figsim ] shows that the force obtained in the monte carlo simulation is weaker than the force calculated for chains with ev interaction .",
    "this is also expected to hold for the depletion interaction between a particle and the wall .",
    "based on field - theoretical techniques we have determined the effective depletion interaction between two non - adsorbing walls confining a dilute solution of long flexible polymer chains .",
    "our main results are :    1 .",
    "the field - theoretical calculation yields the universal scaling functions of the depletion interaction potential and the corresponding force for ideal chains and for chains with excluded volume interaction in the limit @xmath140 , where @xmath6 is the separation between the walls and @xmath121 is the projected end - to - end distance of the chains [ see eqs.([theta ] ) , ( [ gamma ] ) , and ( [ eqd2 ] ) and fig.[fig1 ] ] .",

    "we find fair agreement with corresponding monte carlo simulation data @xcite if the excluded volume interaction is taken into account ( see fig.[figsim ] ) .",
    "we surmise that remaining discrepancies are due to higher order terms in the field - theoretical calculation which are not yet taken into account and due to the possibility that the length of the simulated polymer chain has not yet reached the scaling limit for which the field theory is valid .",
