    "the merging of gas - rich disk - like galaxies is a likely mechanism for rapid morphological @xcite and color transformation , with some kind of feedback process usually invoked to prevent further gas cooling and star formation .",
    "most massive early - type galaxies are spheroidal in shape suggesting that they have formed through major mergers @xcite . models in which spheroids form in gas - rich mergers , with a period of related quasar activity , have been fairly successful in matching a number of observations @xcite .",
    "we maintain , and will discuss below , that the growth in mass on the red sequence has been well measured only for galaxies near the knee of the luminosity function ( lf ; @xmath8 ) ; it is still unclear whether the massive end of the red sequence has seen significant growth since @xmath2 .",
    "if such growth occurs , it is likely to take place through the merging of gas - poor galaxies that already lie on the red sequence since there are relatively few luminous blue galaxies from which the most massive early - type galaxies could form @xcite .",
    "the role of mergers in the build up of massive early - type galaxies , particularly over the epoch from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , is strongly debated . in this paper",

    "this merger fraction seems to be sufficient to explain the growth of the red sequence at the massive end since @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a particularly large uncertainty in interpreting measurements of the merger fraction as a growth rate is the timescale over which mergers can be identified .",
    "the timescale will be different for each measurement technique ( e.g. , visual or automated morphological selection , close pairs ) and is dependent on the properties of the progenitor galaxies and the orbit @xcite .",
    "recent work that calibrates the observability timescale for each method using high - resolution simulations in combination with cosmological models has shown a reassuring consistency between a number of different measurements of the major merger rate and model predictions @xcite .",
    "less direct approaches for estimating the extent to which dry mergers build up massive red galaxies , such as measuring their clustering and size evolution , support a degree of merging activity since @xmath2 but are not yet conclusive .",
    "massive early - type galaxies have evolved substantially in size over this period ( a factor of two growth for a given mass , @xcite ) .",
    "this can be accounted for by the increase in size of individual red galaxies through dry mergers , combined with an increase in the number density of the red sequence galaxy population over time @xcite .",
    "minor mergers may be particularly important for the size evolution of early - type galaxies , as well as a viable means of explaining the evolution of the velocity dispersion function since @xmath7 @xcite .",

    "the evolution must be known  this is one of the reasons that passive evolution ( the evolution of a simple stellar population formed within a short time at high redshift , with a single metallicity ) is often assumed for early - type galaxies .",
    "there is still large uncertainty in both the measurement of the number density evolution and its interpretation .",
    "if one corrects the observed lf for the evolution expected for a purely passively fading old population , there is very little remaining evolution at the bright end since @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these results have been used to infer that the number density of massive red galaxies has not changed substantially over the last 8 billion years and that much of the mass is already in place by this time .",
    "if the early - type galaxy population is continuously supplemented by quenched blue cloud galaxies , the assumption of slow luminosity evolution made in the interpretation the evolution of the lf will be incorrect .",
    "the build up of stellar mass through mergers may act to compensate faster luminosity and color evolution , resulting in changes that look very much like passive evolution .",
    "this is related to the so - called `` progenitor bias '' @xcite ; galaxies that have recently moved onto the red sequence through morphological transformation will be missing from early - type galaxy samples at high redshift , so that at early times , any sample of early - type galaxies consists of only the oldest progenitors of today s early - type galaxies . converting the lf of red galaxies measured by @xcite to a mf using the @xmath18 evolution from fundamental plane measurements @xcite rather than using stellar population models",
    "gives rise to stronger evolution @xcite .",
    "other authors have recently found a similar increase in number density ( approximately a factor of four ) at the massive end using the galaxy mf @xcite . a recent analysis that uses clustering measurements to select likely progenitors of early - type galaxies at high redshift measures a factor of @xmath19 growth in number density , supporting substantial growth through dry mergers @xcite .",
    "the uniformity of the stellar populations in early - type galaxies suggested by the tight cmr in clusters has long been used as an argument that they formed relatively quickly at high redshift @xcite .",
    "however , recent work on the evolution of the red sequence has shown that it is difficult to match both the normalization and change in color with a purely passive , old model @xcite .",
    "the small scatter in the colors of early - types in clusters was thought to impose a limit to the amount of growth that could occur via merging @xcite . in (",
    "* sbs09 hereafter ) we explored how the amount of dry merging expected in a standard hierarchical model affects the scatter and slope of the cmr .",
    "we assumed that major gas - rich mergers move galaxies from the blue cloud onto the red sequence , placing them onto a `` creation red sequence '' given by the local relation between color and magnitude .",
    "we calculated where red galaxies at low redshift lie in color - magnitude space by combining the fluxes of their progenitors , assuming that merging of galaxies on the red sequence does not involve further star formation . by using the local cmr as a reference",
    ", the model essentially assumed that early - type galaxies are evolving passively and at the same rate . with this simple model we showed that dry merging can reduce the scatter and flatten the bright end of the cmr .",
    "the resulting relation was found to agree well with the observed red sequence from the sdss .    in this paper",
    "we incorporate more realistic evolution of the stellar populations into the model described above to test how mergers affect the color , luminosity , and mass evolution of the red sequence since @xmath20 .",
    "our aim is not to make a complete , accurate model of the galaxy distribution ; the point is rather to show how the progenitor bias expected from hierarchical growth in a standard cold dark matter cosmology affects the evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "the models , very much in the spirit of earlier work by @xcite , and others , use stellar population synthesis modeling to follow the luminosity evolution of galaxies , but set the model galaxies into a hierarchical context using merger trees extracted from a semi - analytic model ( sam ) of galaxy formation .",
    "we assume that the red sequence is built up mainly through major gas - rich mergers .",
    "with a reasonably realistic red sequence population in place at @xmath20 , we explore the consequences of subsequent gas - poor and gas - rich merging .",
    "we compare this to the evolution of the same population undergoing only passive evolution with no mergers after @xmath2 .",
    "we show that at fixed mass , dry merging and recent additions to the red sequence decrease the change in color and luminosity .",
    "the resultant evolution is consistent with that of a population that formed early and evolved passively , _ even though there has been significant merging activity_.",
    "to investigate how the colors and magnitudes of galaxies _ evolve _ in a hierarchical universe , we incorporate the evolution of stellar populations of different metallicities into the model described in sbs09 .",
    "galaxy merger trees from the ( * ? ? ?",

    "the sam provides cosmologically motivated merger statistics that have been shown to match well with observations @xcite .",

    "analytic prescriptions for gas cooling ( s08 , section 2.2 ) , star formation ( s08 , section 2.5 ) , supernova feedback ( s08 , section 2.7 ) and agn feedback from winds ( s08 , section 2.10 ) and radio jets ( s08 , section 2.11 ) determine how galaxies form and evolve within the dark matter halos .",
    "a modified chandresekhar dynamical friction formula that takes into account mass loss due to tidal stripping @xcite is used to calculate the time taken for galaxies to merge after the merger of their dark matter halos .",
    "quenching occurs when the central black hole becomes large enough to prevent further gas from cooling through radio mode feedback .",
    "this often occurs for the first time immediately following a major merger , as these mergers trigger a phase of rapid accretion leading to significant growth of the black hole . due to the self - regulation of black hole accretion",
    ", there is a correlation between the mass of the remnant central black hole and the mass of the bulge component of the galaxy , providing a natural link between quiescent galaxies and spheroid - dominated morphologies . at high redshifts and in low mass halos , further cold gas may be accreted via cold dense filaments that are impervious to heating by the radio jets , so star formation may begin again some time after a major wet merger has occurred , even if the existing gas is removed during the merger process .",
    "these physical processes provide the motivation for our simple model but are not included in any detail .",
    "we construct galaxy merger trees from the sam output , using the halo and galaxy identity numbers to track galaxies as they merge , and record the stellar , cold gas and dark matter masses for the two progenitor galaxies involved in every merger .",
    "these are used as input to the toy model .",
    "we infer the metallicity of each merging galaxy from its stellar mass using a simple approximation to the mass  metallicity ( @xmath21@xmath22 ) relation given by @xmath23 this relation was obtained by fitting a straight line through the median metallicity as a function of stellar mass from @xcite and adjusting the normalization by 0.004 so that the color - magnitude relation of the model approximately matches the observations at z=0.9 .",
    "solar metallicity is 0.02 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath21@xmath22 relation does not evolve and the metallicity of each galaxy remains the same for the duration of its star formation .",
    "although these are clearly simplifications , they are defensible choices in the light of this model framework .",
    "the existence of a mass - gas metallicity relation has been established out to @xmath6 @xcite , but it is very difficult to pin down how the relation evolves observationally and there is large uncertainty in the calibration of the observed relation @xcite .",
    "@xcite find a factor of 2 offset between the relation at @xmath1 and @xmath24 but note that the uncertainty is at about the same level .",
    "the rate at which the relation evolves seems to be mass dependent , with very little evolution since @xmath25 for massive galaxies ( @xcite ; but see @xcite , who find lower metallicities by 30%60% at @xmath26 with little mass dependence ) .    in the toy model , the red sequence forms from the remnants of major gas - rich mergers .",
    "we begin by identifying the major wet mergers occurring along every branch of each merger tree .",
    "major mergers are defined to have a mass ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 , where the total baryonic and dark matter mass within twice the navarro  frenk",
    " white ( nfw ) scale radius @xcite is used to determine the ratio ( see s08 ) .",
    "the radius of interest corresponds to approximately 60  kpc for a milky way - size halo . to distinguish between wet and dry mergers",
    ", we assume a gas fraction threshold of 20% , where the gas fraction is defined as the ratio of cold gas mass to total baryonic mass ( cold gas and stars ) . this distinction is somewhat arbitrary but the region of color  magnitude space dominated by galaxies with lower gas fractions corresponds closely to the red sequence in the full s08 sam .",
    "this threshold also produced the closest match between the model and observed red sequences in sbs09 .",
    "if either of the galaxies has a gas fraction of more than 20% , the merger is classified as wet .",
    "we assign each galaxy involved in a major wet merger a star formation history , assuming that the star formation in both progenitor galaxies was truncated at the time of the merger .",
    "the masses and fluxes of the two progenitors are combined and evolved from the time of the merger to the time the remnant galaxy is  observed \" .",
    "if further dry or minor mergers occur before the time of observation , the flux ( mass ) of the secondary galaxy are added to the flux ( mass ) of the main progenitor . the secondary galaxy",
    "s properties are determined by following its merger tree back until a major wet merger occurred , and so on , recursively , for each branch of the merger tree . if no major wet merger occurs along one branch , star formation is assumed to have stopped at the first merger where the main progenitor is recorded as gas poor . only mergers where the mass ratio is between 1:1 and 1:10 are considered .    in keeping with the simplicity of the model , we choose a constant star formation history for each galaxy from some formation redshift @xmath27 up until the time at which star formation stops , with the addition of a burst of star formation at the time of the merger .",
    "we present models with @xmath28 below , but find that the exact choice does not strongly affect the results ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] ) . in principle , any star formation history could be used ; an exponentially declining function is a common choice , for example ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use the @xcite stellar population synthesis models with a chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) and the padova 1994 stellar libraries to determine how the flux changes with time for each population of stars that form and take the loss of material back into the interstellar medium into account .",
    "we interpolate between the simple stellar population evolutionary tracks that are provided for six different metallicities to determine the appropriate evolution given each galaxy s metallicity , calculated using equation  ( [ eqn : mz ] ) .",
    "the star formation rate is normalized so that the total mass in stars remaining at the time of the merger is equal to the stellar mass of the galaxy given by the sam at that time .",
    "the additional burst mass is given by the cold gas mass of the merging galaxy , assuming that all the gas is used up in a burst lasting 1  gyr .",
    "the normalization of the mf was found to be too low compared to observations if no burst was included .",
    "the gas mass can be a substantial fraction of the baryonic mass , particularly at high redshifts , and for low and intermediate galaxies even at @xmath5 .",
    "we test how different star formation histories and the addition of bursts affect the results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "major wet merger remnants redden and fade after the merger , moving onto the red sequence some time after star formation has stopped . in order to compare directly with the observed distribution , we use the same color cut that was used by @xcite to determine which of the model galaxies are on the red sequence at the time of observation , as described in more detail in section  [ sec : results ] . with the assumptions described above",

    "we present the results for three illustrative models for the evolution of the red sequence over the last 8 billion years , pictured in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "we follow the procedure outlined above for all three models until @xmath7 and then allow the models to diverge as described below .",
    "the first situation we consider , model i , is how the red sequence evolves if star formation in red sequence galaxies is shut off at @xmath9 and there are no further mergers of any kind .",
    "we do not allow any further additions to the red sequence through the shutting down of star formation in blue galaxies .",
    "the galaxies already on the red sequence merely evolve passively , becoming fainter and redder , as shown in the first panel of figure  [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "the mf does not evolve because the number density of galaxies on the red sequence is not increased through the addition of wet merger remnants , nor is its composition changed by dry mergers between existing red sequence galaxies .",
    "this case is extreme in the context of the standard hierarchical picture of galaxy formation , and is certainly unrealistic at intermediate masses , where there must be an influx of blue cloud galaxies after @xmath2 to account for the observed increase in mass on the red sequence @xcite . at the bright end ,",
    "which we are most interested in here , it shows how already existing massive early - type galaxies would evolve without undergoing mergers .",
    "this amounts to the purely passive evolution often advocated for early - type galaxies , albeit a population in which some galaxies continued forming stars until @xmath2 .    to implement this model",
    "we truncate each merger tree at @xmath2 .",
    "we follow the evolution of the major wet merger remnants that formed before @xmath2 , adding the mass and flux contributions from subsequent mergers only if they also take place before @xmath2 .",
    "the existing stellar populations evolve passively , with no further star formation , until @xmath30 .      in the second case ( model ii )",
    "we assume that early - type galaxies on the red sequence by @xmath24 have had their star formation quenched by @xmath7 , regardless of the mechanism .",
    "we allow all the mergers predicted by the sam to occur after @xmath2 , but as the star formation in these galaxies has already been truncated , all the mergers occurring thereafter are essentially dry . in this model , which is illustrated in the second panel of figure  [ fig : cartoon ] , the red sequence continues to grow through mergers after @xmath2 and more massive galaxies are built up through dry mergers , but the red sequence galaxies we see at low redshift all have old populations that formed at least 8 billion years ago .    in model ii ,",
    "major wet mergers are no longer the cause of the quenching of star formation after @xmath2 .",
    "galaxies involved in mergers that have not already had their star formation quenched through a major wet merger by this time are assumed to have had a constant star formation rate for 4.5  gyr from @xmath31 to @xmath29 and a star formation rate of zero thereafter . with no new source of fuel , this is a plausible timescale on which the fuel initially available for star formation could be used up , but the exact time at which we halt star formation is not critical .",
    "this particular value was chosen in order to be able to directly compare the changes in the three models from a common starting point at @xmath29 .      in the third model scenario , model iii , shown in the third panel of figure  [ fig : cartoon ] , we allow all the mergers predicted by the sam to occur after @xmath2 and assume that star formation continues until a major wet merger occurs , rather than truncating star formation arbitrarily after 4.5 gyr .",

    "this gives an upper limit for the amount of luminosity and color evolution ; there may be galaxies made up of even older stellar populations that evolve more slowly and galaxies that deplete their gas and move onto the red sequence without undergoing mergers , which do not contribute to the red sequence in these models .    in the middle column of figure  [ fig:9panel ] ,",
    "the evolution of the model with mergers but no star formation after @xmath29 ( model ii ) is shown .",
    "although there are still no new stars formed , the fading and reddening of the cmr is less dramatic than in model i because of the effects of mergers on both the mass and color evolution . while dry mergers increase the mass of galaxies , the slope of the cmr implies that remnants will be no redder than the most massive progenitor , reducing the slope at the bright end of the cmr ( see sbs09 ) .",

    "the noticeable growth in the number density of massive galaxies caused by mergers in the models is consistent with the observations .",

    "these act in opposite senses so that the resultant change in the lf ( central panel ) is much less marked than in model i.    in model iii , major merger remnants added to the red sequence after @xmath29 are assumed to form stars until the time of the merger if their progenitors have a high gas fraction .",

    "the scatter in @xmath46 color is 0.07  mag , consistent with the scatter measured for galaxies in this mass range in clusters out to @xmath47 @xcite .",

    "although some of the galaxies have a different star formation history , the same total mass in stars is added to the red sequence .",

    "we compare the predicted evolution of the three models with the average changes in color and magnitude for passively evolving simple stellar populations ( ssps ) in the same mass range , with four choices of formation redshift , @xmath49 . to calculate the expected evolution of the passively evolving population , we use the bc03 stellar population models to simulate 1000 model galaxies drawn from the observed mf for each formation redshift . rather than simply assuming solar metallicity , we allow for the variation of metallicity with mass , taking into account the relative number of galaxies as a function of mass by assuming they are distributed according to a schechter function ( this is important only at the massive end , where the change in number density with mass is very rapid ) .",
    "we use the observed mf of red galaxies from the sdss @xcite , with parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 to assign each galaxy a weight .",

    "the mass selection thus results in a much smaller sample at @xmath30 in model i than in the other models .",
    "the number density of galaxies with @xmath48 grows by approximately a factor of two in the models where merging has continued after @xmath2 .",
    "the population of galaxies is bluer and brighter at @xmath30 than the corresponding population of galaxies in model i. additions to the red sequence after @xmath2 enhance the effect further ( model iii ) .",
    "the relatively small resulting changes in color and magnitude resemble those of a passively evolving population that formed at higher redshift , as can be seen from the similarity in the position of the model iii point and the passive evolution vectors with @xmath27 between 3 and 5 . the change in color and magnitude for model i replicates that of a more recently formed , passively fading population , because there is no merging or additional star formation that can compensate for the rapid luminosity and color evolution .",
    "observational measurements of the change in @xmath54 can be compared to the change in magnitude at a fixed mass in the models , shown in figure  [ fig : offsets ] . for _ cluster _ galaxies with @xmath55 @xmath56 from @xmath57 to @xmath3 lies in the range of 0.8 - 1  mag @xcite , while @xmath58  mag @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : lfevol ] emphasizes that a red sequence galaxy population with a realistic mix of stellar populations at @xmath2 will undergo very rapid evolution in magnitude at fixed space density if there is no growth in mass ( model i , blue arrow ) .",
    "the evolution is dramatically slowed by growing the red sequence population through dry mergers between already - existing early - type galaxies to larger masses ( model ii , green arrow ) , and slowed further by the addition of wet merger remnants that have recently had their star formation quenched ( model iii , orange arrow ) .",
    "the luminosity evolution in models that include mergers is reasonably consistent with the observations at all space densities probing the bright end of the lf .",

    "choices made in the three models presented here include the @xmath21@xmath22 relation , the mass ratio used to separate major and minor mergers , the gas fraction threshold below which a merger is considered gas - rich , the gas fraction threshold above which a galaxy remains in the blue cloud , the time at which star formation starts , the normalization and shape of the star formation history , the stellar population models and associated stellar library , and the imf . in model",
    "i there is the additional assumption of a time after which no mergers take place ( @xmath2 ) and for model ii , a time after which any ongoing star formation stops ( 4.5 gyr ) .",
    "we implement our model using one particular incarnation of a hierarchical merger tree , taken from the s08 sam , but expect the results to hold more generally in standard hierarchical models .",
    "the merger statistics of various models , including s08 , were compared in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is broad qualitative agreement between the models , but in detail the merger properties can differ substantially .",
    "this is most likely due to the different implementations of baryonic physics , rather than differences in the merger statistics of the dark matter halos , as no significant differences in the results of the sam were found when the model was implemented within @xmath64-body merger trees instead .    in our simple model , the gas fractions and mass ratios of merging galaxies",
    "determine which galaxies move onto the red sequence .",
    "the number density of red galaxies then depends critically on the choice of model and the parameters used to select which galaxies are quenched , but we expect the relative differences between the three scenarios to hold using other merger trees . it is reassuring to note that the baryonic mass ratio distributions of merging galaxies in the s08 , @xcite and @xcite models are similar @xcite .",
    "the mean gas fraction of merging galaxies in the s08 sam is fairly high but comparable to @xcite .",
    "the importance of mergers of different gas fractions differs from model to model as a function of time . in the s08 model",
    "major mergers at @xmath5 are mostly gas - poor , while mergers with a higher mass ratio usually involve a more gas - rich lower mass galaxy and so minor and intermediate mass ratio mergers are gas - rich until lower redshift .",
    "this is not necessarily the case in other models ( see figure  7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the merger fraction for the s08 model was found to compare well with the observed fraction of morphologically disturbed galaxies in @xcite and with the major close pair fraction in @xcite ( see also @xcite for comparisons with earlier versions of the model ) .",
    "the normalization and slope of the color - magnitude relation produced by the model are strongly influenced by the @xmath21@xmath22 relation , but also depend on the star formation histories of the galaxies .",
    "a linear fit to the observed relation from @xcite results in good agreement with the slope of the observed red sequence and a small offset in color compared to observations .",
    "we adjusted the fitted @xmath21@xmath22relation by 0.004 ( see equation  ( [ eqn : mz ] ) ) to improve the match at @xmath29 .",
    "the mean color of the red sequence is slightly redder and no offset to the @xmath21@xmath22-fit is required if we do not incorporate significant bursts of star formation but assume only a constant star formation history for each galaxy ( see section  [ sec : sfh ] ) .",
    "the consequences of dry mergers for the colors of massive red galaxies depend on the existence of a tilt in the color - magnitude relation but are fairly insensitive to the exact choice of @xmath21@xmath22 relation .",
    "the scatter in the red sequence is driven mainly by age differences .",
    "the scatter in all three models is smaller than observed .",
    "this leaves room to include scatter in the @xmath21@xmath22 relation . assuming a log normal relation with a width of 0.1  dex @xcite results in slightly larger scatter in all the model red sequences , still well within the range expected from observations .",
    "the differences between the models are evident even when improbably large scatter in the @xmath21@xmath22 relation is used .",
    "one could imagine that if all mergers back to the highest redshifts are considered , most dark matter halos are likely to have had a major merger , with many of these mergers occurring at early times when the masses of the galaxies involved were very small . using a non - evolving @xmath21@xmath22 relation then implies that the metallicities would be very low . with no further star formation , the metallicities of remnant galaxies on the red sequence would remain unrealistically low .",
    "this turns out not to be a concern .",
    "we consider mergers taking place after the assumed formation redshift of @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that only the final gas - rich major merger on any branch of the merger tree moves the remnant onto the red sequence .",
    "this excludes some very gas rich mergers occurring at high redshifts , which is a reasonable assumption as long as the remnant retains sufficient gas to remain in the blue cloud or re - accretes gas before a second major merger . it does lead to a concern that similar types of mergers may have different effects depending on when they occur , or be entirely ignored in one case while creating a red sequence galaxy in another case .",
    "an alternative approach could be to enforce an upper gas fraction threshold , above which the remnant is assumed to remain in the blue cloud ( see section [ sec : lfdisc ] below ) .",
    "these conceptual issues largely affect the creation of the model red sequence but will have little effect on the differences between the models at low redshift .",
    "we have shown that the red sequence produced by @xmath2 under the current set of assumptions agrees sufficiently well with observations to merit its use as a reference .",
    "we have chosen a very simple constant star formation history for all galaxies as the default .",
    "this was also the approach followed by @xcite in their models of red sequence color evolution .",
    "there are many other options that could be considered .",
    "the scatter we find is consistent with that of @xcite , who used an exponentially declining sfr in their exploration of how the scatter in the cmr is affected by the continuous addition of quenched blue cloud galaxies .",
    "an exponentially declining sfh may not be a good description for all galaxies , however .",
    "lyman break galaxies that are forming stars at high levels at redshifts above two may be better described by an increasing sfh , for example @xcite .",
    "previous work on the progenitor bias @xcite used three parameters to describe the star formation history  the start time , end time , and a parameter that describes how sf varies within this period .",
    "they note that the details of how the sfr changes with time are not very important ; the evolution of an individual galaxy can be approximately described as the evolution of an ssp that formed at the time given by the mean luminosity - weighted age of the galaxy @xcite .    in our fiducial model ,",
    "star formation for all galaxies begins at a redshift of four .",
    "we tested more extreme starting times corresponding to @xmath65 and @xmath66 , as well as a variation in which the starting times are randomly chosen from a gaussian distribution of width 0.5  gyr centered on @xmath67 and constrained to lie between @xmath68 and @xmath69 . for a more recent starting time ( @xmath70 )",
    "the model red sequence is bluer than the observed relation by approximately 0.05  mag at @xmath29 . at @xmath30 , the red sequence for model",
    "i is slightly redder than observed , model ii matches well with the observed relation , and model iii remains slightly bluer than observed .",
    "the luminosity evolution for all three models is faster as all the stars have formed more recently .",
    "this gives larger changes in both color and magnitude between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the relative changes for the three models are in the same sense as before but the impact of allowing star formation to continue after @xmath2 is lessened , leading to a smaller difference between model ii and iii . when star formation starts at @xmath66 , the evolution is slightly slower for all models but the results are very similar to the fiducial case .",
    "the results when a range of starting times is allowed are almost indistinguishable from those with a single starting time .    if major wet mergers are the catalyst for the quenching of star formation , as we have assumed in our models , they are likely to be accompanied by a burst of star formation that uses up or expels the remaining fuel from the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "we found that it was necessary to convert the significant amounts of cold gas in major wet merger progenitor galaxies in the sam to stars in order to produce high enough masses .",
    "it is not surprising that neglecting the cold gas results in lower normalization , as this gas is converted into stars in the full sam , and the mf of the sam at @xmath3 matches well with observations .",
    "bursts of star formation have stronger impact at higher redshifts , where the galaxies have higher gas fractions , approximately doubling the mass of galaxies with @xmath71 .",
    "we tested other ways of implementing bursts as well as star formation histories in which the same amount of mass is formed with no burst .",
    "it has been shown that star formation in mergers is only mildly enhanced with respect to normal star - forming galaxies at @xmath72 @xcite ; thus we would not expect a large fraction of the mass to form in merger - induced bursts of star formation .",
    "the enhancement in star formation due to mergers in the s08 sam was found to agree well with observations @xcite , suggesting that dramatic bursts of star formation are not needed , at least at @xmath5 . at higher redshifts ,",
    "more intense bursts of star formation may occur .",
    "in general , the enhancement in sfr caused by a merger is dependent on the morphologies , masses and gas fractions of the galaxies involved , as well as the orbital parameters and the mass ratio .",
    "the relative evolution of the three models and our conclusions remain the same whether the gas mass is excluded , included in a single burst at the time of the merger or incorporated into an extended period of star formation , although the colors do depend on this choice . with a constant star formation rate and no burst ,",
    "the colors are redder by @xmath73  mag on average .",
    "the color is also dependent on the length of the burst ; a shorter , more intense burst of star formation produces slightly bluer galaxies , but again has little impact on our conclusions . allowing star formation to continue for some time after the merger may be more realistic than the sudden quenching we assume , but it would make little difference to the results .",
    "it is possible to produce a cmr with a similar slope and normalization at @xmath2 ( using the same @xmath21@xmath22 relation ) by assuming that all the stars formed in a single burst at fairly high redshift ( @xmath74 ) rather than over an extended period of time .",
    "the scatter in the relation is caused by differences in the color evolution for different metallicity populations rather than differences in age .",
    "we find that the scatter at the massive end of the relation in this model is unrealistically small at @xmath29 ( 0.02  mag for @xmath75 ) .",
    "allowing for scatter in the @xmath21@xmath22-relation would compensate for this to some extent .",
    "although the scatter in the relation as a whole remains approximately constant to low redshifts , the scatter for the most massive galaxies actually increases slightly in this model ( 0.04  mag at @xmath30 ) .",
    "the evolution in color and luminosity to low redshifts is too rapid compared to observations , even if dry mergers are included .",
    "an earlier formation redshift ( @xmath28 ) results in too red a relation by @xmath2 although the change in color between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is approximately correct .",
    "this incompatibility between high redshift single - burst passive evolution models and the observed color evolution has been pointed out by @xcite and others .",
    "the shape of the model lf and mf differs somewhat from the observed relations ( see figure  [ fig:9panel ] ) .",
    "the number densities of galaxies at the bright end and faint end in the models that include mergers after redshift one ( model ii and iii ) agree reasonably with the observed number densities from @xcite but there is a shortage of intermediate luminosity galaxies . in the models , the evolution in the mfs results solely from mergers , but includes new additions to the red sequence through major mergers , as well as the increase of mass in existing red sequence galaxies .",
    "there is very little evolution below the knee of the mf , even in the two models where",
    "mergers occur , suggesting that more migration of blue cloud galaxies onto the red sequence than predicted by this model is necessary to match the observed evolution at intermediate masses . secular processes such as disk instabilities may lead to bulge formation through the development of bars and clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . at lower masses ,",
    "model galaxies appear to be in place too early .",

    "the total mf of the sam , as well as the mfs split by color , agree well with observations from the sdss @xcite at low redshift .",
    "there is very little evolution in the sam mf , however , resulting in increasing differences to the observed relations at higher redshifts .",
    "this seems to be the case in a number of sams and is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "although the sam produces a bimodal distribution of galaxies in color  magnitude space at @xmath3 , the distribution also becomes increasingly different from the observed distribution at higher redshifts . even if the total lf of the sam matched well with observations at @xmath7",
    ", the relative contributions from red and blue galaxies would not necessarily agree .",
    "the difficulties in matching the observed lfs in detail were to some extent our motivation for simplifying the model and using only the fairly robust merger trees from the sam as the basis of this work .",
    "future work using the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) to ensure that the distribution of galaxy masses in the model matches that of observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will allow us to compare quantitative predictions with the observed evolution .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the relative changes between different models at a fixed mass and space density to demonstrate the effects of mergers , rather than making a direct comparison with the observed evolution .",
    "it has been pointed out that bulges are less likely to form in extremely gas - rich mergers @xcite . as less massive galaxies have higher gas fractions , this would inhibit the formation of low - mass red sequence galaxies .",
    "this effect is redshift dependent because galaxies had higher gas fractions in the past .",
    "the efficiency of bulge formation depends on mass ratio , gas fraction and the orbital parameters of the merger .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to include this level of detail , however we found that applying a simple upper gas fraction threshold for spheroid formation strongly suppresses the number of low mass red sequence galaxies formed .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the observed and model mfs at the low - mass end at @xmath30 using an upper gas fraction threshold of 80% , above which the merger remnants are assumed to stay in the blue cloud rather than moving onto the red sequence .",
    "the mf at @xmath29 overshoots the observed distribution at low masses , however this is where incompleteness in the observations may be an issue . if no upper threshold is applied , the lf and mf overshoot the observations at low masses . with a threshold of 70% ,",
    "the mass functions agree well at @xmath29 but more fading of low mass blue cloud galaxies without mergers is required after @xmath2 to reproduce the low - redshift mass function . adjusting the threshold has almost no impact on the growth at the massive end .",
    "we have verified that the implications of mergers on the evolution of color and luminosity described above are independent of the exact choice of stellar population synthesis model . using the models of @xcite with a kroupa imf results in somewhat slower evolution between @xmath2 and the present day for simple stellar populations , and correspondingly slower evolution in both color and magnitude in all three models . the color  magnitude relation , lf and mf are similar to those shown in figure  [ fig:9panel ] , and the differences in evolution between the models at low redshifts are in the same sense as shown in figure  [ fig : offsets ] .",
    "the main difference between the @xcite and @xcite models is the treatment of post - main sequence evolution , particularly tp agb stars .",
    "the impact is strongest in the near infrared bands and at high redshifts , as shown by @xcite and others , and so we do not expect very big differences .",
    "the choice of imf affects the evolution of both luminosity and color .",
    "the distribution of stellar masses has a stronger impact on the luminosity evolution than the color evolution , which is determined largely by the age of the stellar population , however @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the evolution in our models would depend on the imf , but we expect the differences between the models to hold for any of the `` standard '' imfs .      the progenitor bias @xcite and consequences of mergers that we have demonstrated here have been recognized as an important factor for the evolution of the red sequence for some time and pointed out in numerous papers on the evolution of massive early - type galaxies ( for e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "what is new in this work is the calculation of the magnitude of those effects in a hierarchical model , and a comparison of the evolution of massive red galaxies with and without mergers after @xmath7 .",
    "models by @xcite considered the co - evolution of early - type galaxies and quasars , assuming a quasar phase is triggered by merging activity and spheroidal galaxies form as remnants of mergers .",
    "they use the observed quasar luminosity function as a starting point and reproduce a number of properties of early - type galaxies , including the lf , mf and evolution of the @xmath18 ratio .",
    "later models using the hod approach with the simple assumption that major mergers are responsible for quenching star formation and forming spheroids also predicted a number of properties of early - type galaxies that match well with observations @xcite . we have used a simpler model framework but make similar assumptions on the formation of spheroids .",
    "our results are in good agreement .",

    "many of these models have implicitly or explicitly shown that massive early - type galaxies form hierarchically rather than evolving purely passively for many years now .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the fairly rare massive early - types in the densest environments ( brightest cluster galaxies ) continue assembling to low redshifts , mostly through dry mergers , although the stars in these merging components may have formed at high redshifts @xcite . in a recent",
    "paper @xcite examine how much mass in bulge galaxies has been contributed by mergers and disk instabilities .",
    "interestingly , they find that disk instabilities play the most important role at intermediate masses , where the discrepancy between the model and observed mfs is greatest in our merger - only bulge - formation scenario .    the lf is often used to probe the mass growth of massive early - types by testing whether there is evidence for any evolution beyond that of an old , passively evolving model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have shown that even with mergers the lf can appear to evolve only by the amount expected from passive evolution .",
    "one of the strongest implications of this work is then that the lf alone can not be used to distinguish between the passive and hierarchical formation scenarios for massive early - type galaxies .",
    "mass measurements that are independent of the assumption of passive evolution are required .",
    "a recent measurement of the evolution of the mf where the lf is converted to a mf using the observed evolution of the @xmath18 led to a higher estimate of the change in number density of massive galaxies that is more consistent with the predictions of hierarchical models @xcite .",
    "@xcite also measure a greater change in number density using masses determined from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting , but other works that use similar methods still find very little evolution @xcite .",
    "note that there is strong model dependence in fitting seds to obtain masses , which can lead to large uncertainties ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we have used galaxy merger histories from a hierarchical model , in conjunction with simple star formation histories and stellar population synthesis models , to explore the color and magnitude evolution of red sequence galaxies in several scenarios .",
    "we use the galaxy merger trees from the s08 sam combined with stellar evolutionary tracks from the @xcite model , making simple assumptions on the relation of mass to metallicity and the redshift at which galaxy formation begins .",
    "we assume that major wet mergers are effective at quenching star formation but that star formation may also shut down after some period of time , independently of mergers . with this model setup",
    ", we examine the role of recent mergers and the effect of adding younger populations to the red sequence at late times .    a red sequence population with a realistic color  magnitude distribution at @xmath2 can be formed through the passive fading of galaxies that form in a single burst relatively recently ( @xmath76 ) or through more extended star formation , shut down by major mergers at different times , in galaxies that began forming earlier ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "galaxies that form all their stars at high redshifts have colors that are too red by @xmath2 and produce a cmr that has smaller scatter than observed , but the slow reddening they experience thereafter gives approximately the observed amplitude of color evolution .",
    "a population with approximately the correct color at @xmath2 evolves very rapidly over the last half of cosmic history if no further mergers occur and there is no new mass added to the red sequence ( model i ) .",
    "this results in a color  magnitude relation that is too red at low redshift , with too few bright red galaxies and too much luminosity evolution at fixed space density compared to observations . at a fixed mass ,",
    "the change in color and magnitude predicted by such a model are approximately the same as the changes predicted for a purely passively evolving population that formed at @xmath76 .",
    "dry mergers occurring between @xmath2 and @xmath3 slow down the luminosity and color evolution of the early - type galaxy population .",
    "the mass ( and light ) added through mergers counteracts the fading of the luminosities expected from stellar evolution when no new stars are forming .",
    "the result is a slightly bluer cmr at @xmath3 that is closer to the observed relation , and more realistic evolution of the lf and mf ( model ii ) . by allowing star formation to continue in some galaxies after @xmath2 ,",
    "the changes in a population s color and luminosity are reduced even further ( model iii ) .",
    "this late morphological transformation is known as progenitor bias @xcite .",
    "both the cmr and the lf evolution of this model are consistent with the observed evolution .",
    "the smaller changes in color and magnitude at a fixed mass replicate the behavior of a passively evolving population that formed in a single burst at high redshift ( @xmath78 ) .    at the bright end of the red sequence ,",
    "the seemingly slow passive evolution of luminosity and color is equally well interpreted as the passive evolution of an ancient population , or as the cosmologically motivated hierarchical growth of an evolving population .",
    "although they predict very similar evolution , the implications of these scenarios for the growth of stellar mass are very different .",
    "diagnostics other than the lf , such as the number density evolution estimated using dynamical @xmath18 information , the growth rate determined from close - pair statistics and the evolution of the clustering strength of early - type galaxies lend support to the hierarchical picture .",
