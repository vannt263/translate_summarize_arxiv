    "many recent studies have explored the potential global effects of agn outflows on all scales of their environment : from influencing the growth of the central supermassive black hole @xcite , the evolution of the host galaxy @xcite , the luminosity function of quasars @xcite , and the magnetization and chemical enrichment of galactic gas @xcite and the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "it is unclear if the outflows seen as uv / x - ray absorption are related to these global phenomena , or if they are connected to other agn components showing evidence for bulk outflow motion such as the relativistic jets seen in radio observations and the emission - line gas .    measured ionic column densities provide the basis for physical interpretation of agn outflows .",

    "* ) , and possibly inhomogeneous distributions of absorbing material @xcite .",
    "detailed spectral studies of rich absorption line spectra at high spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) are needed to deconvolve these effects from the observed absorption lines , and thereby determine the total column density , ionization , and chemical abundances of the outflow via modeling .",
    "the quasar absorption - line spectrum of qso j2233 - 606 ( hereafter j2233 ) has been intensively observed and studied due to its location in the center of the hubble deep field south ( hdfs ; ferguson 1998 ) , its high redshift ( @xmath4=2.238 ) , and relative brightness ( @xmath517.5 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the rich intervening absorption spectrum , these observations have revealed several  associated \" absorption systems @xcite .",
    "these have been interpreted as outflowing material associated with the qso in j2233 due to their partial line - of - sight coverage of the compact agn emission , relatively broad widths , and proximity in redshift to the host galaxy ( @xmath62.198  2.21 ) .",

    "we present here a detailed analysis of the absorption - line properties and physical conditions in the associated absorption systems based on this spectrum .",
    "our study is outlined as follows : in  2 , we review the observational details and present the intrinsic absorption spectrum from these observations . in  3 , we make use of the broad spectral coverage which includes the cno lithium - like doublets and   lyman series lines at high resolution and high s / n to solve for the individual covering factors of the emission - line and continuum sources and the velocity - dependent ionic column densities . in  4 ,",

    "* ) requires more than two lines to obtain the full solution .",
    "in particular , if continuum and line emission both underly the absorption features , the individual emission sources will in general have different covering factors , with implications for the doublet solution and relative values between different lines ( see  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "we applied a global fitting approach to determine the velocity - dependent covering factors and column densities of the outflow in j2233 , following the method outlined in @xcite .",

    "we limited our search of the covering factor parameter space to the physically meaningful range , 0@xmath261 .",
    "regions of contamination with other absorption were omitted from the fitting .",
    "this included the far blue wing of component 1  @xmath111242 and red wing of component 3  @xmath111238 due to blending of these lines , and obvious intervening ly@xmath12 forest lines : at @xmath274240 and @xmath154140  km  s@xmath2 in  @xmath111238 and @xmath274030  km  s@xmath2 in ly@xmath13 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "a source of modeling uncertainty is the intrinsic flux levels of the continuum and blr emission ; the vlt / uves spectrum is not flux - calibrated and thus the intrinsic shape of the agn emission can not be determined from these data . therefore , to determine the relative contributions , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we adopted results from previous observations of j2233 . for   and ly@xmath13 ,",
    "we used the hdfs stis g430 m spectrum obtained in 1998 october .",
    "for the longer wavelength lines , we used published results from earlier ground - based observations : ly@xmath12 and   were from data in @xcite obtained between 1997 august  1998 august and   from a spectrum in @xcite obtained in 1997 october .",

    "a caveat is that since these observations were obtained at previous epochs ( the uves spectrum was obtained in 1999 october ) , there may have been variability in the intrinsic emission that could affect our results .",
    "however , we believe this effect will be minimal since high - luminosity qsos like j2233 do not typically exhibit strong variability over timescales of a few years . for example , in a recent analysis of the @xmath32500 qsos in the sdss database having multiple observations separated by more than 50 days , @xcite found only 12% exhibited significant variability . additionally ,",

    "no covariance matrix elements are computed since it is not a minimum in the solution ; for these cases , we estimated uncertainties by deriving solutions for models keeping the parameter fixed , and finding the value giving @xmath331 from the best - fit solution at the boundary value . for @xmath343 , an absorption line can be considered to be saturated  for these large optical depths , changes in @xmath17 affect the absorption depths less than the uncertainties in the flux levels .",
    "thus , we adopt solutions giving @xmath353 as lower limits of 3 .",
    "this occurs over much of the core of the component 1   profile , and over a narrower region of the core of   in this component .",

    "component 3 only partially occults the continuum source , with @xmath360.75 . the blr emission is partially occulted in component 1 , peaking at @xmath370.55 in the core and decreasing sharply in the wings of the profile . in components 2 and 3 ,",

    "if this were instead an artificial distinction , it seems unlikely that the same result for @xmath24 would be obtained over the numerous bins associated with each component , particularly since they exhibit a range of optical depths for each ion and optical depth ratios between ions .",

    "to determine the physical conditions and abundances in the outflow in j2233 , we compare the measured ionic column densities derived in  3 with predictions from models computed with the photoionization code cloudy @xcite .",
    "a model is specified by the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ionizing continuum , the total hydrogen column density ( @xmath41 ) and elemental abundances in the absorber , and the ionization parameter ( @xmath42 ) , which gives the ratio of the density of h - ionizing photons at the face of the absorber to the gas number density , @xmath43 .    in components 1",

    "the model predictions for  @xmath11977 are also seen to be consistent with the observations .",
    "additionally , absorption from the si iv @xmath111393,1403 doublet is predicted to be negligible in these models and consistent with the tight upper limits on the si iv column densities from the uves spectrum ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we note that for the parameters derived here , these uv absorption systems will produce negligible x - ray warm absorber features .      here",
    "we derive constraints on components 4  6 . with only  detectable in the uves spectrum , there are not enough constraints to solve for the individual covering factors .",
    "however , comparison of the depths of the doublet members reveal the weak component 4 just redward of component 3 has low covering factor .",
    "though uncertainties from the doublet solution are rather large for weak features like this ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it requires that the continuum source is only partially covered ( i.e. , even if the blr is fully unocculted ) , with @xmath24 at least as low as the value derived for component 3 .",
    "the effective covering factors for components 5 and 6 are larger , consistent with @xmath67 0.8  1 .",
    "we note that these solutions should be taken with caution due to possible contamination with the ly@xmath12 forest , and with no other lines for confirmation .    to constrain the physical conditions in these absorbers , we measured  column densities using the doublet solution @xcite , and derived upper limits on , , and .",
    "this gives lower limits on @xmath44 , @xmath41 via photoionization modeling .",
    "the ionization in all three components is substantially higher than components 1  3 .",
    "adopting the abundances derived above for components 1  3 implies log(@xmath44 ) @xmath39 @xmath150.25 , 0 , and @xmath150.4 and log(@xmath41 ) @xmath39 17.7 , 18.4 , 17 for components 4  6 respectively , but the values could be substantially greater .",
    "upper limits on @xmath44 , @xmath41 come from the   upper limit , giving log(@xmath44 ) @xmath40 0.5 , log(@xmath41 ) @xmath40 19.7 for each component . assuming the features in the   stis spectrum are real for these components , the implied column densities are consistent with the upper range .      as described in  3.1 ,",
    "our solution to the absorption parameters ( @xmath17,@xmath16 ) involved some simplifying assumptions .",
    "specifically , we assumed : ( 1 ) the covering factors are identical for all ions ( separately for the continuum and blr sources ) , and ( 2 ) the absorption column density for each ionic species is uniformly distributed over the occulted fraction of the background emission ( i.e. , it is a perfect step - function in our sightline to the emission regions ) .",
    "we explore the implications of these assumptions in more detail below .    _",
    "ion - dependent covering factors _    the assumption that all ions have the same covering factors was invoked in our global fitting to increase the number of fitting constraints so that the individual continuum and blr covering factors could be solved .",
    "the results from this fitting matched the observed profiles well overall ( see figure 4 ) , indicating the assumption is not too far off .",
    "however , there are some discrepant regions in the fit which may signify a more complex absorption - emission geometry in the j2233 outflow ; primarily , the absorption strength in the  blue ( red ) doublet member is systematically underestimated ( overestimated ) over the core region of component 1 and in some regions of component 2 .    to explore this further ,",
    "we have computed column densities and covering factors for each doublet / ly@xmath12-ly@xmath13 pair individually using insight from our global fitting .",
    "specifically , we fixed the continuum covering factor at the average value for each kinematic component from the global fitting ( @xmath68 1 , 0.92 , 0.75 for components 1 , 2 , and 3 respectively ; see figure 2 ) , and then solved for @xmath17 and @xmath25 separately for each ion line pair by applying @xmath48 analysis to equation 1 .",
    "we believe this is the best approach to explore ion - dependent covering factors since the blr is much larger than the uv continuum source , thus differences in covering factors between ions would most likely be due to affects of blr coverage . for 1@xmath31 uncertainties in these parameters , we adopted the maximum offsets from the best - fit solutions which give @xmath692 , since there are two lines being fit .",
    "solutions can only be obtained at velocities where both members of the line pair are uncontaminated with other absorption .",
    "bins that are saturated ( we adopted @xmath35 3 ) have only lower limits on their column densities . in figure 3 , we plot the column density profiles derived from this analysis .",
    "the primary differences of these solutions are that the  column density is somewhat larger in component 1 ( and equivalently @xmath25 is lower ) , by up to @xmath350% , and the associated 1@xmath31 uncertainties for all ions are generally larger than in the global - fit solutions .",
    "figure 3 shows that most of the narrow substructure in the optical depth profiles in components 2 and 3 described in  3.2 is still present in the individual ion solutions .    to test the potential affect of ion - dependent covering factors on our photoionization modeling results",
    ", we did the analysis described in  4.1 using the column densities derived individually for each ion in component 1 ( most of components 2 and 3 have no solutions for either  or h i due to contamination ; see figure 3 ) .",
    "the results for the abundances are presented in figure 5 , showing the @xmath48 values as dotted contours .",
    "the carbon and nitrogen abundances derived from this model are about a factor of 1.5 times greater than the solutions using the global - fit column densities , whereas the oxygen abundance is similar .",
    "we note that since  is saturated over a large portion of the component 1 profile and thus has only lower limits on the column density , this may lead to an underestimate of the oxygen abundance .",
    "_ inhomogeneous absorption _",
    "another assumption we have made in our @xmath70 measurements is that the absorber is a perfectly homogeneous slab , with uniform column densities spanning the occulted portion of the background emission .",
    "more complicated distributions of outflow material , with a continous range of optical depths distributed with different covering factors ( i.e. , an inhomogeneous absorber ) , were first explored by de kool et al .",
    "more recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ak05 ) and",
    "* hereafter sh06 ) presented detailed analyses of inhomogeneous absorber ( ia ) distributions and their implications for observed absorption troughs .",
    "results from these studies indicate inhomogeneous absorption will not have a large affect on our modeling results and conclusions for the outflow in j2233 , as described below .    in ak05",
    ", it was shown that for lines from the same ionic level that have different optical depths ( e.g. , doublet line pairs or lyman series lines ) , cases where the observed residual fluxes in the two line troughs are finite and equal in high s / n spectra ( i.e. , non - black saturation in the traditional partial coverage models ) , can not be explained straightforwardly by ia models . instead , they require a sharp edge in the distribution of absorber material , consistent with the homogeneous partial coverage model .",
    "specifically , using simple functional forms for the absorber material ( power - law and gaussian distributions ) , ak05 showed that  shallow \" distributions ( i.e. , power - laws with small spectral indices or gaussians with relatively large @xmath71 parameters ) can not produce finite but equal residual fluxes for any conditions , and steep distributions require unrealistically high values for peak optical depths ( see their figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the more general calculations of sh06 , which allowed non - zero minimum bounds on the optical depth distribution , alleviated the peak @xmath17 requirements somewhat for cases of low residual fluxes .",
    "however , even for these calculations , there is no way to obtain an absorption profile for a single line pair that gives equal residual fluxes at some velocities but different fluxes at others unless the functional form of the distribution of material is velocity - dependent across the component ( e.g. , see the models with @xmath720.9 for the hpc models in table 1 of sh06 ) .",
    "this is precisely the case observed in the troughs of j2233 , for example in and in component 1 .",
    "such a situation seems physically implausible .",
    "thus we conclude that the ia models as presented in the detailed studies of ak05 and sh06 do not provide a natural interpretation for the j2233 outflow .",
    "finally , we note sh06 have shown that even for cases where inhomogeneous absorption does apply , the mean optical depths derived by assuming homogeneous partial coverage are very similar to the mean values for ia distributions for most cases ( they diverge somewhat for strongly peaked distributions ) .",
    "thus , the solutions from the homogeneous partial covering analysis are generally representative of the inhomogenous distributions ( for cases that are not saturated ) , once the mean optical depths are accounted for by averaging over the unocculted and occulted regions .",
    "it has yet to be shown , however , the implications for photoionization models which are done assuming a slab of uniform column density .",
    "here we synthesize the above results on the kinematics , geometry , ionization , and abundances to explore the global nature of the outflow in j2233 .      determining abundances in quasar outflow systems serves as a probe of the chemical evolution of the universe , with implications for the timing and mechanisms for nucleosynthesis and distribution of metals on galactic and intergalactic scales .",
    "analysis of intrinsic narrow absorption - line systems provides the best means for probing the abundances of qso environments : bal lines are typically heavily saturated and blended preventing determination of ionic column densities , whereas observed emission - lines sample the integrated flux over a large spatial region , and thus likely sample a large range of physical conditions .",
    "evidence for near - solar or super - solar abundances has been found in associated absorbers in several other high redshift ( @xmath73 24 ) qsos ( see references in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this is often not definitive due to limited quality of spectra .",
    "additionally , linking these results to qso outflows is uncertain in many cases since they lack other properties that would indicate the absorbers are intrinsic to the agn .    as shown in  4.2 and figures 5 and 6 , all three outflow components in j2233 with available fitting constraints have supersolar abundances , with enhanced n enrichment : @xmath74 35 @xmath75 for c and o , and n / h scaling roughly as @xmath58 .",
    "the similarity in results derived independently in each kinematic component gives strong support for this finding .",
    "additionally , the enhanced n abundance relative to c and o supports the general finding of high abundances in the absorbers , since secondary cno nucleosynthesis becomes important after the system has reached near solar metallicity , based on observations and chemical enrichment simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the advanced chemical processing implied by our detailed fitting indicates the host galaxy of j2233 underwent vigorous star formation at an early epoch , before @xmath762.2 .",
    "given the finding of high metallicity in associated absorbers in other bright , distant qsos , this supports the evolutionary scenario in which massive galactic nuclei undergo rapid , extensive star formation at early times , with most chemical enrichment occurring before at least @xmath77 23 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a subsequent or coeval qso phase may then distribute the enriched gas to the host galaxy , and possibly igm , via an outflow .",
    "the finding of distances of agn outflows from the nucleus on kpc scales or greater @xcite supports this general model that qso winds can seed their environments with metals .",
    "the detailed results of our absorption fitting and modeling reveal correlations in the kinematic , geometric , and ionization structure in the j2233 outflow . for example , our analysis in  3 ( figure 3 ) shows the covering factors of the individual kinematic components with low - ionization absorption are correlated with outflow velocity . to summarize , the highest velocity absorber , component 1 , fully occults the continuum source and covers @xmath3 60% of the blr , component 2 is consistent with full continuum coverage but little or no blr coverage , while component 3 only partially occults the continuum source ( @xmath370% ) .",
    "one interpretation of this trend is that the absorption region size increases with outflow velocity , at least as projected on the sky against the background agn emission ( i.e. , in the transverse dimension , @xmath78 ) . _",
    "if _ the absorbers in our sightline to the nuclear emission have a uniform density filling their entire volumes ( i.e. , filling factor @xmath791 ) , e.g. , if each component is a single  cloud \" or continuous flow region , then the expression relating the h column density to the volume density and radial thickness of the absorber is @xmath80 .",
    "since the integrated @xmath41 for the low - ionization regions are similar for components 2 and 3 and somewhat greater for component 1 , if the radial dimensions of the absorbers follow the same trend as the transverse sizes in the scenario described above ( e.g. , for a cloud - like geometry ) , then the volume densities decrease with outflow velocity .",
    "furthermore , the similarity in ionization parameter for the low - ionization material in each component (  4 , figure 7 ) implies their @xmath81 products are similar via the expression for @xmath44 given in  4.1 .",
    "combining these results would imply a correlation between outflow velocity and @xmath82 for the components in j2233 if all of the above assumptions apply .",
    "qualitatively , this result is consistent with the predictions from dynamical models which have continuous acceleration of a radial outflow .",
    "another interpretation of the @xmath83 correlation is that outflow regions with higher velocity have moved further across our sightline to the emission sources .",
    "the distance of the absorber from the central ionizing source ( @xmath82 ) has important implications for assessing the total energy and mass flux associated with the outflow .",
    "the most direct and accurate way of determining @xmath82 is by measurement of the volume density in the absorbers , @xmath84 , from excited level absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the presence of these diagnostic lines in agn outflows is rare .",
    "they are not detectable in the spectrum of j2233 within the noise limits ; this is due to the relatively low - ionization of the species giving excited level uv absorption ( e.g. , @xmath111260 , @xmath111336 , @xmath111175 ) compared with the ionization state of the outflow .",
    "however limits on @xmath82 and the geometrical structure of the outflow can still be explored based on indirect arguments involving other measurable quantities .",
    "for example , if the filling factors of the absorbers are unity as described above , then combining the expressions for @xmath41 and the ionization parameter (  4.1 ) following @xcite gives the geometrical parameters @xmath82 and @xmath85 in terms of the parameters derived from photoionization models , the h - ionizing photon flux , and constants : @xmath86 the photon flux can be estimated from the luminosity distance to j2233 ( 20 gpc for @xmath87 71 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 , @xmath880.27 , @xmath890.73 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and integration of our model sed over the ionizing continuum , giving @xmath903@xmath810@xmath91  s@xmath2 .",
    "we can use the covering factors derived for the blr (  3 ) and the size of the blr to constrain the projected transverse size ( @xmath78 ) of the absorption regions in our sightline to the background agn emission . using the relation ( @xmath92 ; e.g. ,",
    "* ) , this gives @xmath93 1  pc for component  1 ( @xmath370.5 ) , and smaller for components 2 and 3 ( @xmath370 ) .",
    "if the radial sizes of the absorption regions are similar to these limits on the transverse sizes , @xmath94 , consistent with a cloud - like geometry , then equation 4 implies @xmath9 50  kpc if the filling factor of the absorbing medium is unity .",
    "this large distance seems improbable , requiring the presence of extremely small structure relative to its distance from the nucleus , with just the right line - of - sight geometry to partially cover the agn emission .",
    "however , similar results have been implied in analysis of other qso outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . alternatively , if the outflow has a thin shell geometry ( @xmath95 ) , it could be considerably closer in to the nucleus ; this model was adopted by @xcite , for example , to explain the x - ray absorption in ngc 5548 .",
    "another alternative is that the volume filling factor of the absorption material in our line - of - sight is small ( i.e. , it is highly clumpy ) . in this case , the effective radial thickness of the absorber is proportional to @xmath96 , placing the outflow closer to the nucleus for a given @xmath85 : @xmath78 ratio .",
    "we note that very low volume filling factors appear to be a generic feature of qso outflows seen in the uv , and its implications and requirements on dynamical models was recognized early on in the study of these systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting feature of the outflow in j2233 is the prevalence of narrow kinematic structure seen in the absorbers .",
    "this is directly apparent in the clustering of distinct kinematic components 2  6 , which combine at adjacent velocities to give continuous absorption over @xmath97 500  km  s@xmath2 . also , the detailed fitting and modeling in  3 and 4 revealed the relatively broad component 2 and 3 absorbers are comprised of a series of narrow peaks in column density ( @xmath61 25  50  km  s@xmath2 )",
    "further , component 1 shows strong velocity - dependent ionization differences : the red - wing is of significantly higher ionization , with saturated   absorption and weak or negligible absorption from lower - ionization species .",
    "this may be interpreted as the superposition of two physically distinct components , partially overlapping in velocity space .",
    "similar clustering in velocity of multiple , relatively narrow components is commonly seen in qso outflows .",
    "for example , many balqsos show narrow substructure in some of the weaker lines coinciding in velocity with or adjacent to the broad troughs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in a recent multi - epoch study of qso hs 1603 + 3820 , @xcite found a cluster of partially overlapping narrow components had become deeper and more blended , appearing almost as a bal trough .",
    "these results indicate we are seeing a number of distinct absorption regions in our line - of - sight to the agn emission , either different stream lines associated with continuous outflows or distinct clouds .",
    "perhaps there is a continuous distribution of absorption widths associated with agn outflows , ranging from the narrow components seen in j2233 to the classical bal troughs , with the observed width related to the details of the outflow mechanism or orientation of our sightline to the nucleus .",
    "the clustering in velocity suggests the distinct regions are related , possibly determined by the details of their origin or driving mechanism .",
    "it is interesting that the low - ionization component 1 and 3 absorbers in j2233 both have higher ionization absorption at adjacent , lower outflow velocities .",
    "similar structure was seen in the qso 2359 - 1241 absorber , and was taken as evidence for ionization stratification in a disk wind by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found some objects show the opposite trend , with low - ionization absorption coinciding in velocity with the low - velocity region of bal troughs .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the intrinsic uv absorption in the central hdfs target , qso j2233 - 606 .",
    "our analysis is based on a high - resolution ( @xmath9 30,000 - 50,000 ) , high s / n ( @xmath0 25  50 ) spectrum obtained with vlt / uves .",
    "this spectrum samples the cluster of intrinsic absorption systems outflowing from the agn at radial velocities @xmath15000  3800 km  s@xmath2 in the lithium - like cno doublets and   lyman series lines , which serve as key diagnostics to determine the covering factors , column densities , ionization state , and abundances of the outflow .",
    "we fit the absorption troughs as a function of radial velocity using a geometric model which assumes independent line - of - sight covering factors for the individual background emission sources ( continuum and emission - line ) and the same covering factors for all ions .",
    "the solution reveals :    1 .",
    "there is a trend of increasing covering factor for components with greater outflow velocity : component 1 at @xmath274950  km  s@xmath2 occults the entire continuum source and @xmath355% of the blr ; component 2 at @xmath274150  km  s@xmath2 covers the continuum source , but little or none of the blr ; component 3 at @xmath273950  km  s@xmath2 only partially covers the continuum source ( @xmath370% ) .",
    "narrow kinematic substructure in the ionic column densities is prevalent .",
    "the red - wing of component 1 is highly ionized , having saturated  and weak absorption from lower ionization species compared with the core of this component .",
    "components 2 and 3 break down into a series of subpeaks in @xmath17 , seen consistently in the solutions to different ions .",
    "we performed detailed photoionization modeling to determine the metal abundances and physical conditions in the absorbers .",
    "ionic column densities were simultaneously fit for all velocities of each component by constraining the abundances in each velocity bin to be the same .",
    "this technique greatly increased the number of modeling constraints , allowing a fit to the individual elemental abundances of c , n , and o relative to h , as well as the velocity - dependent ionization parameter and total column density .",
    "our analysis shows :    1 .",
    "all absorption components have supersolar metal abundances , with [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] @xmath30.5  0.9 , and [ n / h ] @xmath3 1.2 .",
    "this is consistent with the z@xmath98 scaling of n predicted from secondary cno nucleosynthesis .",
    "consistent results are found for independent fits to each component individually .",
    "the lowest ionization material in each of components 1  3 has similar ionization ( log(@xmath44 ) @xmath991.2 ) .",
    "higher ionization gas is required at the same velocities to account for the   absorption , as shown also by @xcite .",
    "the redwing of component 1 , and components 4  6 which lie just redward of of component 3 , have ionization parameters at least 5  10 times greater than the low - ionization component 1  3 gas .",

    "<S> we present a detailed analysis of the intrinsic uv absorption in the central hdfs target qso j2233 - 606 , based on a high - resolution , high s / n ( @xmath025  50 ) spectrum obtained with vlt / uves . </S>",
    "<S> this spectrum samples the cluster of intrinsic absorption systems outflowing from the agn at radial velocities @xmath15000  3800 km  s@xmath2 in the key far - uv diagnostic lines - the lithium - like cno doublets and  lyman series . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the absorption troughs using a global model of all detected lines to solve for the independent velocity - dependent covering factors of the continuum and emission - line sources and ionic column densities . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals increasing covering factors in components with greater outflow velocity . </S>",
    "<S> narrow substructure is revealed in the optical depth profiles , suggesting the relatively broad absorption is comprised of a series of multiple components . </S>",
    "<S> we perform velocity - dependent photoionization modeling , which allows a full solution to the c , n , and o abundances , as well as the velocity resolved ionization parameter and total column density . </S>",
    "<S> the absorbers are found to have supersolar abundances , with [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] @xmath30.5  0.9 , and [ n / h ] @xmath3 1.1  1.3 , consistent with enhanced nitrogen production expected from secondary nucleosynthesis processes . </S>",
    "<S> independent fits to each kinematic component give consistent results for the abundances . the lowest - ionization material in each of the strong absorbers is modeled with similar ionization parameters . </S>",
    "<S> components of higher - ionization ( indicated by stronger  relative to  and ) are present at velocities just redward of each low - ionization absorber . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the implications of these results for the kinematic - geometric - ionization structure of the outflow . </S>"
