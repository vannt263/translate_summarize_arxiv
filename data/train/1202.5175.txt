    "the spinless salpeter equation ( sse ) , whose general form is given by ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of the system , is the simplest relativistic eigenvalue equation .",
    "it is sometimes denoted semirelativistic since it is not a covariant formulation .",
    "this equation can be considered as a schrdinger equation with its nonrelativistic kinetic part replaced by a relativistic counterpart .",
    "more rigorously , it is obtained from the covariant bethe - salpeter equation @xcite with the following approximations : elimination of any dependences on timelike variables and neglect of particle spin degrees of freedom as well as negative energy solutions @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that a nambu - goto string meson with a short - range coulomb interaction is described by a sse with a time component vector funnel potential , for fixed angular momentum and large radial excitation @xcite .",
    "numerous techniques have been developed to solve numerically this equation @xcite .",
    "though a quite high precision can be reached , it is always interesting to obtain bounds on eigenvalues .",
    "first , they can be used as verifications of the computation .",
    "second , they are generally a simple and fast way to obtain information about the spectra . sometimes , bounds yield analytical results which can give precious details about the solutions of the sse . with some rare exceptions",
    "@xcite , most of the analytical results have been obtained for the symmetrical version of the sse @xcite @xmath3 the one - body ( two - body ) case is treated with @xmath4 ( 2 ) .",
    "note that an arbitrary positive value of @xmath5 can be considered to study duality relations between different many - body systems @xcite .    in this work , we will use the auxiliary field method ( afm ) @xcite to obtain a generic upper bound on the eigenvalues of the general sse .",
    "the computation are presented in section  [ ub ] after a brief description of the afm . in section  [ ar ] ,",
    "some analytical results obtained with this bound are given and compared with numerical solutions .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "at the origin , the afm was introduced to get rid of the square root kinetic operator in calculations for semirelativistic eigenvalue equations @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been generalized to treat a greater variety of problems @xcite . as it is shown in @xcite ,",
    "the afm has strong connections with the envelope theory @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , both methods have been introduced from completely different starting points . in particular , the afm introduces the notion of auxiliary fields ( also called einbein fields ) which is explained below .",
    "we will consider here a potential @xmath6 depending only on the radial distance .",
    "the idea is to replace the hamiltonian in ( [ sse12 ] ) by the following one @xmath7 with three auxiliary fields @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the kinematics is nonrelativistic , @xmath12 is the auxiliary potential and the prime denotes the derivative .",
    "if we put in @xmath13 the field values which extremize @xmath13 , @xmath14 then @xmath13 reduces to the genuine hamiltonian in ( [ sse12 ] ) .",
    "the approximation lies in the fact that these auxiliary fields are no longer considered as operators but as constants . in this case ,",
    "an eigenvalue of @xmath13 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an eigenvalue of the nonrelativistic hamiltonian @xmath17 the afm approximation for an eigenvalue of the genuine hamiltonian is given by @xmath18 for which @xmath19    if @xmath20 , the treatment of the potential is trivial and the afm reduces to the replacement of the semirelativistic kinetic energy by the best possible nonrelativistic counterpart .",
    "an afm eigenvalue is then an upper bound @xcite . in the general case",
    ", a function @xmath21 can be defined by @xmath22 .",
    "it can then be shown that an afm eigenvalue is an upper bound on the exact energy if @xmath21 is a concave function ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this property has been demonstrated in the framework of the envelope theory @xcite , but can be applied as well to the afm @xcite .",
    "interesting results can be obtained if the auxiliary potential is a power law , @xmath24 whose sign is chosen in order that @xmath10 is always a positive quantity . in this case , a very convenient parameterization of @xmath16 is given by @xcite @xmath25 @xmath26 is a global quantum number which is exactly known in the following cases :    * @xmath27 , @xmath28 ; * @xmath29 , @xmath30 , for @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the @xmath33th zero of the airy function ai ; * @xmath34 , @xmath35 .    in the general case , accurate values of @xmath26 can be easily numerically computed .",
    "simple and good analytical approximations can be found in @xcite .",
    "after some algebra , constraints ( [ condextrema ] ) , with @xmath12 given by ( [ pr ] ) , reduce to @xmath36 where @xmath37 is defined by @xmath38 . from ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) , we can deduce that @xmath39 it seems then quite natural to define @xmath40 in such a way that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath43 , ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) can be written as @xmath44 after some algebra , the approximate eigenvalue ( [ eafm ] ) with the parameterization ( [ epspr ] ) can be written @xmath45    finally , the afm solution is given by the following set of equations @xmath46 the parameter @xmath37 can then be interpreted as a mean distance between the particles and @xmath47 as a mean momentum per particle .",
    "if @xmath21 , with @xmath48 , is a concave function or if @xmath49 , then @xmath2 is an upper bound on a true eigenvalue .",
    "it is remarkable that the only trace of the auxiliary potential is contained in the value of @xmath26 . with the notation , @xmath50 , the system ( [ afm1])-([afm3 ] )",
    "can be recast under a form similar to the one of the system ( 3.2)-(3.4 ) in @xcite .",
    "this shows that ( [ afm3 ] ) is the translation into the afm variables of the generalized virial theorem @xcite .    ,",
    "width=226 ]    a semiclassical interpretation of the system ( [ afm1])-([afm3 ] ) is also possible .",
    "let us assume a classical circular motion for the two particles , as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : class ] . in this case , the force @xmath51 acting on particle @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 taking into account that both particles are characterized by the same momentum @xmath47 , this equation becomes @xmath54 the rigid rotation constraint , @xmath55 , implies that @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",

    "( [ fi2 ] ) and ( [ r0r1r2 ] ) can be recast onto the form ( [ afm3 ] ) , and it is obvious than ( [ afm1 ] ) gives the mass of the system .",
    "the total orbital angular momentum is @xmath60 .",
    "a semiclassical quantification gives thus @xmath61 , and we obtain a system very similar to ( [ afm1])-([afm3 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the afm produces more general results : equations are obtained not only for a circular motion ; the quantum number @xmath26 is unambiguously determined by the choice of the power law auxiliary potential ; a good choice of this potential can allow to obtain an upper bound ; an eigenstate of @xmath62 ( [ hnr ] ) , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , is an approximation of the genuine eigenstate @xcite .",
    "it is easy to obtain numerical upper bounds of the sse with the system ( [ afm1])-([afm3 ] ) .",
    "one can wonder if it is possible to obtain analytical solutions ?",
    "due to the presence of the square roots , it is only conceivable with very special conditions . if one mass is vanishing ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) and if the potential is a sum of power - law interactions @xmath67 with @xmath68 , ( [ afm2])-([afm3 ] ) reduce to @xmath69 this transcendental equation can only be easily solved for @xmath70 , in such a way that only @xmath71 appears in ( [ afm3fun ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the funnel potential often used in hadronic physics : the sort range part is a strong coulomb interaction stemming from the one - gluon exchange mechanism while the long range part is a linear confinement @xcite . in this case ,",
    "( [ afm3fun ] ) is a cubic equation in @xmath71 whose solution is a very complicated expression , unusable in practice .",
    "so we will only consider the two parts of the funnel potential separately .",
    "we can expect a massive particle linked with a massless particle solely in a heavy - light meson , but then a confining potential is always present .",
    "so the system treated here with the sole coulomb potential is quite academic .",
    "nevertheless , equations are interesting to treat . with @xmath72 , ( [ afm3fun ] )",
    "becomes @xmath73 which implies that @xmath74 . in this case , the solution is @xmath75 the replacement of this value in ( [ afm1 ] ) yields to @xmath76 this result was found in @xcite but without the discussion given in the following . as expected from scaling arguments",
    ", the ratio @xmath77 is only a function of @xmath78 and of the quantum numbers .",
    "this property is also valid for the genuine eigenvalue .",
    "this last result can be compared with the afm solution of the symmetrical sse ( [ ssesig ] ) with the coulomb potential @xmath79 , @xmath80 this result can be found in @xcite or can be derived with the afm @xcite . as expected , in both cases",
    ", if @xmath81 is vanishing , the only energy scale disappears and the system can not exist .",
    "so , the ultrarelativistic limit ( @xmath82 ) is not relevant .",
    "but the asymmetrical case is more intriguing .",
    "indeed , the rest energy is not properly defined in this case when the interaction disappears , since one of the particle is massless . from equations above ,",
    "a solution @xmath2 exists only when the following condition is verified : @xmath83 the right part of this inequality corresponds to the cancellation of the binding ( @xmath84 when @xmath85 ) , and the left part corresponds to a collapse ( @xmath86 when @xmath87 ) .",
