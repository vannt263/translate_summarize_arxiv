    "in recent years , some fundamental effects in optics have attracted much attention , such as the spin hall effect of light  @xcite , optical coriolis effect  @xcite , and optical magnus effect  @xcite .",
    "they manifest themselves as the splitting of photon spin states , that is , when a linearly polarized light beam passes through a refractive index gradient ( e.g. , interfaces of different media ) or an inhomogeneous medium , its left and right circular polarization components separate from each other .",
    "this spin - dependent splitting ( sds ) effect is directly attributed to different geometrical phases that the two spin components respectively experienced , corresponding to the spin - orbital interaction  @xcite .",
    "the light beam can acquire a spin - dependent geometrical phase upon the reflection or refraction of a refractive index gradient created by the interface of different media .",
    "when a linearly polarized paraxial light beam impinges obliquely upon this interface , the sds in real space ( coordinate space ) generates , that is , the two spin components separate from each other and reside on both sides of the incident plane  @xcite .",
    "this effect is known as the spin hall effect of light , which has recently also been extensively studied in other physical systems  @xcite , in addition to optics .",
    "actually , different refractive index gradients can give a light beam different geometrical phases , thereby resulting in specified switchable and enhanced sds effects  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the geometrical phase can serve as an alternative tool for steering photon spin states .",
    "in general , real - space sds is often accompanied with the @xmath1-space ( momentum space ) sds , associated with spin - dependent angular shift  @xcite . under normal incidence ,",
    "both real - space and @xmath1-space splittings vanish due to the degeneracy of the geometrical phases of the two spin components  @xcite .    while for some inhomogeneous anisotropic media , such as surface plasmonic nanostructures , plasmonic chains , and subwavelength gratings  @xcite , even as under normal incidence , the light beam can also acquire spin - dependent geometrical phases , and generates the sds in the @xmath1-space . the real - space splitting can be induced after light propagating to the far field .",
    "some recent researches have also shown that @xmath0 plate , a uniaxial birefringent waveplate with space - variant optical axis orientations , can give a beam @xmath3 topological charge and spin - dependent geometrical phases ( @xmath0 is an integer or a semi - integer )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , tunable @xmath0 plates made by liquid crystals have been demonstrated to be conveniently realized , with arbitrary topological charge and geometrical phase  @xcite .",
    "therefore , from this point of view , it would be interesting to explore the sds effect in the @xmath0 plates as well as its potential ability to manipulate the photon spin states .    in this work ,",
    "we theoretically show that the @xmath0 plate can be employed to steer the sds of light in the far field .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath0 plate can apply a spin - dependent geometrical phase to a light beam that passes through it . and",
    "the geometrical phase is tunable by varying the @xmath0 plate geometry or incident linear polarization angle .",
    "when a linearly polarized light beam normally passes through the @xmath0 plate , @xmath1-space sds first occurs . after converging by a lens ,",
    "the induced real - space sds in the far - field focal plane is distinguishable .",
    "the normalized stokes parameter @xmath2 is employed to reveal the separation of spin photons , because @xmath2 represents the circular polarization degree of light  @xcite .",
    "we find that the spatial distribution of @xmath2 exhibits a multi - lobe and rotatable splitting pattern with rotational symmetry .",
    "further , by tailoring the structure geometry of the @xmath0 plate and/or incident polarization angle of light , the lobe number , and the rotation angle both are tunable .",
    "note that as the light beam impinges normally into the @xmath0 plate , the birefringence does not induce the separation of ordinary and extraordinary light , which will not contribute to the sds effect .",

    "( a)-(d ) represent the geometries for @xmath4=0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively.,height=264 ]",
    "the @xmath0 plate is essentially a uniaxial birefringent waveplate with locally varying optical axis ( fast or slow ) orientations in the transverse @xmath8 plane , having a homogeneous phase retardation @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 the refractive indices of slow and fast waves , material thickness , and operation wavelength , respectively .",
    "it can be currently realized using liquid crystals , sub - wavelength gratings , or polymers  @xcite .",
    "the fast axis orientations , as specified by a space - variant angle @xmath14 it forms with the @xmath15-axis , are described by the following equation : @xmath16 where @xmath0 is an integer or semi - integer ; and @xmath4 indicates the angle of local optical axis direction forming with the local radial direction .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows four geometries of @xmath17 for different values of @xmath4 .",

    "the two curves with arrows indicate that the splitting patterns will rotate when rotating the incident polarization direction ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the additional devices for measuring the stokes parameter @xmath2 are not shown.,width=321 ]        as the @xmath0 plate has space - variant optical axis orientations , a position - dependent jones matrix @xmath25 can be employed to fully characterize the light propagation through the @xmath0 plate  @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 an input linearly polarized light , with its electric field described by a jones vector , is given as @xmath28 here , @xmath24 is the linear polarization angle of the polarization vector forming with the @xmath15-axis ; see fig .",
    "let @xmath29 be a collimated gaussian beam : @xmath30 $ ] with @xmath31 the beam waist . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the absorption and loss , and let @xmath19 and @xmath20 both be equal to 1 .",
    "then , the output electric field , @xmath32 , can be calculated as @xmath33\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc }   1\\\\   i\\end{array}\\right)e_0\\nonumber\\\\   + \\frac{1}{2}e^{i\\theta}\\left[\\cos\\frac{\\phi}{2}+i\\sin\\frac{\\phi}{2}e^{i\\varphi}\\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc }   1\\\\   -i\\end{array}\\right)e_0 , \\label{output}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34\\label{phase}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is an additional space - variant geometrical phase  @xcite , depending on the local optical axis orientation of the @xmath0 plate .",
    "@xmath35 consists of two parts , corresponding to a coherent superposition of the left and light circular polarization components , each of which is respectively composed of two terms : one carries a space - variant geometrical phase ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath3 topological charge , and the other does not .",
    "this originates from the partial conversion of the spin - to - orbital angular momentum , with the conversion efficiency determined by @xmath37  @xcite . actually , as the incident beam",
    "is linearly polarized , the partial left - handed photons transform into right - handed photons and acquire an additional angular momentum ( @xmath38 ) to keep the total angular momentum conserved , and vice versa  @xcite . generally , the spin - orbital interaction is the origin of such fundamental effects as the spin hall effect of light , optical coriolis effect and optical magnus effect , which manifest as the sds phenomenon .",
    "thus here , under normal incidence of a linearly polarized light , @xmath1-space sds will first occur , and then real - space sds upon propagation .",
    "note that @xmath39 involves three free parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath24 , which serve as effective ways for manipulating the sds of light .",
    "the momentum shift of the sds then can be calculated as  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , representing the left and right circular polarization components , respectively , and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the unit vector in the @xmath15(@xmath21)-direction . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are position - dependent , with the shift directions respectively determined by their signs . as the geometrical phase of the @xmath0 plate is space - variant both in the @xmath15 and @xmath21 directions ,",
    "the @xmath1-space sds and shift in both directions occur simultaneously .",
    "unlike here , a recent work reported a constant momentum shift in plasmonic chains where the sds effect occurred in one direction  @xcite .",
    "we then consider the far - field sds effect .",
    "a lens with focal length @xmath47 is used here to converge the output field of the @xmath0 plate , and the field in the focal plane can be viewed as a far field , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the real - space shift induced by the sds in the focal plane can be written as @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "it is also position - dependent , which means each point in the @xmath0 plate contributes a different momentum shift ; thereby , in the far field , the final splitting effect is determined by their coherent superpositions .",
    "the electric field distribution in the focal plane can be derived from the fraunhofer - diffraction integral formula  @xcite : @xmath49}{i\\lambda f_0}\\int\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!s_{\\alpha\\beta } } dxdy\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times e_{out}^{x(y)}(x , y)\\exp\\left[-\\frac{i k_0}{f_0}(xu+yv)\\right ] , \\label{integral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are axes parallel to the @xmath15 and @xmath21 axes , respectively , @xmath52 is the space range of the @xmath0 plate , and @xmath53 represents the @xmath15(@xmath21)-polarized component of @xmath35 . as this integral is too complicated to solve analytically , we will evaluate it numerically .    to show the circular polarization degree of the resulting electric field and reveal the separation of spin photons , the stokes parameter @xmath2 is employed .",
    "describing the sds by @xmath2 is believed to be the photonic version of a stern - gerlach experiment in the absence of a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 , normalized to the total intensity in the focal plane , can be calculated as  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the phase of @xmath56 and the denominator represents the total intensity in the focal plane .",

    "other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "the white arrows show the clockwise rotation of @xmath2 with the increase of @xmath4.,width=321 ]    we now can demonstrate the sds in the far field produced by the @xmath0 plates . as stated above , the far - field sds of left and right circular polarization components results from their spin - dependent geometrical phase experienced in the @xmath0 plate .",
    "since the geometrical phase is space - variant , the @xmath2 parameter is inhomogeneous in the far - field focal plane .",
    "note that @xmath39 involves three tunable parameters : @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath24 , we will then explore the influence of these parameters on the sds .",
    "the first two parameters are associated with changing the @xmath0 plate geometry , and the third one is just related to changing the incident linear polarization angle which may be more convenient to adjust .",
    "we first discuss the influence of the @xmath0 value on the sds .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the spatial distribution of the calculated @xmath2 parameter for @xmath61 ( @xmath57 ) under the linearly @xmath15-polarized incidence ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "it is well known that @xmath63 corresponds to left - handed polarization helicity and @xmath64 corresponds to right - handed polarization helicity .",
    "specifically , @xmath65 or @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath22 or @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "one can notice that , for @xmath61 , the spatial distributions of @xmath2 show 4 , 8 , and 12 independent lobes , respectively , with alternative @xmath22 and @xmath23 components .",
    "moreover , the @xmath2 exhibits twofold rotational ( @xmath67 ) symmetry for @xmath17 , fourfold rotational ( @xmath68 ) symmetry for @xmath69 , and sixfold rotational ( @xmath70 ) symmetry for @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "these characteristics are determined by the rotational symmetric geometries of the @xmath0 plate and the geometrical nature of the space - variant geometrical phase [ eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) ] .",
    "interestingly , a similar four - lobe spin splitting effect has also been observed in semiconductor microcavities for exciton polaritons  @xcite and subwavelength metallic apertures for photons  @xcite , which corresponds to the case of @xmath17 .",

    "the white arrows show the counterclockwise rotation of @xmath2 with the increase of @xmath24.,width=321 ]    here , we can give a qualitative explanation for this interesting sds phenomenon .",
    "note that the output electric field of the @xmath0 plate has two parts with opposite spin handedness and topological charge ( @xmath3 ) , that is , two helical circular polarization beams [ see eq .",
    "( [ output ] ) ] .",
    "the wavefront of the helical beam with @xmath3 topological charge is composed of @xmath75 intertwined helical surfaces , with their handedness determined by the sign of @xmath76  @xcite . after interfering and propagating to the far - field focal plane",
    ", these helical surfaces form @xmath77 independent lobes with alternative @xmath22 and @xmath23 components , which can be described by the @xmath2 parameter .",
    "nonvanishing @xmath4 and @xmath24 will cause the rotation of the spatial distribution of @xmath2 , since they both can give an initial value to the geometrical phase @xmath39 .",
    "we take @xmath17 for an example to show the influence of @xmath4 and @xmath24 on the sds . as @xmath4 and @xmath24",
    "play similar roles in the geometrical phase with just opposite signs , their influences will cancel out each other .",
    "when @xmath62 , increasing @xmath4 will result in the clockwise rotation of @xmath2 for the @xmath4 radian , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . accordingly , increasing @xmath24 under the condition of @xmath57 will make @xmath2 rotate counterclockwise for the @xmath24 radian ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath4 and @xmath24 produce the same rotation angles but opposite rotation directions .",
    "these results confirm the predications .    in the above calculations",
    ", we have assumed that the @xmath0 plate served as quarter waveplates ( @xmath78 ) with space - variant optical axis orientations .",
    "it is worth noting that , actually , the sds does not occur for all cases of @xmath37 . when @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is an integer ) , the term carrying the geometrical phase in eq .",
    "( [ output ] ) vanishes , and the remaining part represents a field with the same polarization as the incident light , that is , no sds occurs .",
