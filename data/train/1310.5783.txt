    "the daya bay reactor neutrino experiment is specifically designed for measuring the neutrino mixing angle @xmath0 with a sensitivity down to the 1% level @xcite",
    ". however , the deployment of 8 electron - antineutrino detectors ( 8 ads ) in three different experimental halls ( daya bay near site , ling ao near site , and far site ) motivates studies for a supernova online trigger without complicated reconstruction and offline analysis .",
    "the three experimental halls are more than 1 km apart from each other , which enables a powerful and prompt rejection of muon - induced and accidental backgrounds superior to that of a single - detector .",
    "in addition , a relatively low energy threshold of 0.7 mev enhances the detection of the full energy spectrum of supernova burst neutrinos ( sn@xmath1 ) since the energy spectrum may vary according to the supernova core collapse model .",
    "a supernova online trigger system is installed and in preparation to join the supernova early warning system ( an international organization abbreviated to snews ) , providing the astronomical community with a prompt alert of the occurrence of a galactic core collapse event @xcite with the false alarm rate @xmath2 1/month .",
    "the ads in daya bay are designed to detect the @xmath3 via inverse beta decay ( ibd ) interactions @xmath4 .",
    "each single ad has 22 tons of liquid scintillator ( ls ) and 20 tons of liquid scintillator doped with gadolinium ( gd - ls ) , giving a total target mass of @xmath5330 tons in 8 ads .",
    "the coincidence of the prompt scintillation from the @xmath6 and the delayed gamma emission of the neutron capture provides a distinctive @xmath3 signature against the background .",
    "the dominant backgrounds are accidentals , cosmogenically produced fast neutrons , @xmath7li/@xmath8he decays and the neutrons from the retracted @xmath9am-@xmath10c calibration source . the average delay of the gamma emission of the neutron capture is 28 @xmath11s for gadolinium and 200 @xmath11s for hydrogen .",
    "supernova burst neutrinos ( consisting of @xmath12 ) play a role in the study of both supernova dynamics and neutrino physics , because    * @xmath599% of the stellar collapse gravitational binding energy is converted to neutrinos which arrive at the earth a few hours before the visual supernova explosion ( sne ) .",
    "so , it is believed that neutrino emission and interaction are a key diagnostic for the dynamics of core collapse and supernova explosion @xcite ; * supernova burst neutrinos can serve as probes of neutrino properties , e.g. neutrino mixing , neutrino mass , neutrino lifetime , magnetic moment of neutrino , electric charge of neutrino , radiative decay of neutrino , etc . @xcite and also the mass hierarchy @xcite ; * joint analysis with gravitational waves can provide deep insight into the core collapse of supernovae @xcite .",
    "the expected sn explosion rate is @xmath50.01/year @xcite within kilo - parsec ( kpc ) distances and is around once per 50 years in the milky way . within mpc distances ,",
    "the rate is @xmath51/year @xcite , but the neutrino flux is much smaller . the sn@xmath1 energy spectrum within the first 10 seconds of the supernova exlosion @xcite for different flavor components implies the energy range of electron - antineutrinos is up to @xmath560 mev with average energy 12@xmath515 mev .",
    "the explosion timescale is @xmath510 s with @xmath598% of the @xmath3 luminosity emitted @xcite .",
    "this timing feature is exploited to form an online trigger for sn@xmath1 in all the experiments listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : sn_event ] , where the main features are summarized . based on the target mass , tab .",
    "[ tab : sn_event ] shows that about 12 sn@xmath1 events in one ad and 100 events in all for 8-ads are expected at daya bay and a sn@xmath1 event is defined as the detection of one neutrino from a single sn explosion .",
    "even though other experiments may have higher expected sn@xmath1 events mainly due to the target mass , it is emphasized that the unique feature of daya bay in contrast is that it is not a single - detector .",
    "this paper explains this advantage and shows that the daya bay experiment is sensitive to all the 1987a - type ( referring to the luminosity and average energy of @xmath3 ) sne in the milky way which can be seen in fig .",

    "the supernova online trigger system in daya bay is embedded in the data acquisition system ( daq ) , online looking for increase in multi - ad signals in 10s - time - window and sending prompt alarms . according to this task ,",
    "all the study of supernova online trigger is for online prompt trigger judgment and not so precise as offline analysis .",
    "the purpose of the background study on one hand is to have a good understanding of the background coincidences in multi - ad , thus allowing to set a precise false alarm rate threshold .",
    "the false alarm happens frequently as the detectable sn explosion to the earth is so rare and the selected events are always backgrounds . on the other hand",

    "the resulting online , measured single ad event rates are 0.019 , 0.013 and 0.0013 hz / ad at the daya bay near site , ling ao near site and far site , respectively .    , suggesting the prompt and delayed energy cut.,width=302 ]      assuming that the spectrum of supernova burst neutrinos follows a quasithermal distribution @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the average energy and @xmath17 a numerical parameter describing the amount of spectral pinching .",

    "sn@xmath1s have been simulated separately in both the gd - ls and ls region of a single ad , whose results after selection cuts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] . with these simulation results , the detection efficiency of sn@xmath1 that undergo an ibd in the detector volume",
    "is estimated to be @xmath20 and used to determine the expected number of sn@xmath1 events in each ad at daya bay .",
    "an approach is developed to investigate the background coincidence rate , e.g. false alarm rate , by combining all 8 ads sn@xmath1 candidate events in the 10s - time - window .",
    "the sn@xmath1 candidates are always backgrounds as so rare sn explosion can be observed by neutrino detection in the earth .",
    "every one second , the sn@xmath1 candidates in the previous 10s - time - window are counted in each ad , forming a combination to judge whether to trigger or not .      a trigger table is generated to list the ad background combination cases in order of their corresponding false alarm rate for the sliding 10s - time - window . utilizing this table , it is convenient to set the cut for the combination cases due to a certain false alarm rate threshold according to snews requirement . below ( tab .",
    "[ tab : triggertable ] ) , part of the trigger table for online test is shown as an example where the contents are all for backgrounds .    in tab .  [",
    "tab : triggertable ] , the number under each ad is the background event number counted in the 10s - time - window .",
    "the first two columns correspond to the detectors in the daya bay near site , the next two columns correspond to the ling ao near site and the four remaining columns correspond to the far site .",
    "the column `` false alarm rate '' is defines not as the trigger rate relative to the combination in that row but as the total trigger rate of all the ad background combination cases below . before the false alarm rate calculation , the ad background combination cases are firstly in descending order with respect to their trigger rates .",
    "then for each combination case , the total trigger rate of those below it and itself is calculated serving as the corresponding quantity `` false alarm rate '' .",
    "obviously , a trigger cut can be determined easily due to the false alarm rate threshold .",
    "for example , a 1/34s ( 0.0293111 hz ) false alarm rate threshold is required and then the last row of tab .",
    "[ tab : triggertable ] is where to place the cut below which all the ad background combination cases have a smaller `` false alarm rate '' and are supposed to trigger a supernova early warning .",
    "this table is for background false alarm control and sn@xmath1 events are expected to have higher probability for coincidence in 8-ads than muon - induced fast neutrons or reactor neutrinos , etc . in detailed detection probability for sn explosion , please see section  [ sndetprob ] .",
    "it is also emphasized here that the `` false alarm rate '' in tab .",
    "[ tab : triggertable ] is predicted rather than measured .",

    "however , the prediction has a challenge ",
    "the overlap in the sliding 10s - time - window  every one second , the sn@xmath1 candidates of each ad are combined for judgment and the 10s - time - window is overlapped by a few adjacent ones .    for a single ad ,",
    "it is verified with the numerical simulation that the rate ( hz ) ( here the probability is numerically equal to the rate as every one second there is a combination ) of the event count in the sliding 10s - time - window still follows the poisson distribution with the mean value @xmath21 .",
    "this is the fundament of the combination calculation .    in terms of the combination of multiple ads , assuming different experimental halls",
    "are mutually independent for backgrounds , the correlation between ads in the same site is considered and measured using the data .",
    "the correlation between ads in the same site originates from the muon - induced fast neutrons which cause several consecutive signals in detectors of the same experiment hall . the trigger rate for each combination case",
    "is predicted using several unknown independent poisson variables that formulate the event rate of each ad and some of which are shared by the correlated ads in the same experimental halls representing the correlation part .",
    "these unknown poisson variables can be calculated eventually based on the measured single ad event rates and correlation between ads .",
    "in addition , given the trigger rate of each combination case , the statistical error can be derived utilizing some statistic skills in which case the data sample has to be split into 10 parts according to the time and each of the 10 parts is 1s delay or earlier than the adjacent one . to verify the prediction ,",
    "the rates measured on data are compared to the prediction and 82% are within 1@xmath22 , 98.4% are within 2@xmath22 , and 99.7% are within 3@xmath22 consistent with the prediction .",
    "therefore , the prediction of background combination rate is plausible to replace the measured one .",
    "notice that the systematic error is negligible compared with the statistical error when the threshold is set too small such as 1/year , or even 1/month .",
    "the scheme of the supernova online trigger system in daya bay is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snews_diagram ] .",
    "it includes several software applications implemented in the daq of daya bay .",
    "the online part is able to get access to all the raw data and make a simple reconstruction .",
    "the ibd selection program for each ad provides the information of sn@xmath1 candidates to a combination server with the function of combination and trigger judgment according to the trigger table mentioned above .",
    "there are two levels of trigger , silent trigger ( 1/month ) and golden trigger ( 1/year ) , which are related to different offline responses . in case of a golden trigger",
    ", an e - mail alert is immediately sent and information of those sn@xmath1 candidates is written into an offline database with about 10 seconds time latency .",
    "a pure offline analysis would cross check both the golden and silent triggers with less than 40 min latency .",
    "the shaded area in the diagram has been tested and officially installed , while the offline analysis / cross - check is being developed based on the performance quality monitoring system ( pqm ) of daya bay .",
    "daya bay is negotiating to join the snews and the e - mail alert is presently sent to daya bay collaborators who are interested .    to exclude unexpected trigger bursts ( e.g.  electronic noise ) in one detector or one experimental hall ,",
    "a simple but effective uniformity cut based on the @xmath23 method is applied with less than 1% detection probability lost for supernova explosions .",
    "this @xmath23 is the minimum value of @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the event counts in the combination for each ad and @xmath26 is the best fit value of event counts for all ads considering sn@xmath1 events are distributed uniformly among ads .",
    "detection probability of a supernova explosion is explained next section .",
    "according to the target mass of the daya bay detectors , the detection efficiency of sn@xmath1 obtained based on mc and the relation between supernova neutrino time - integrated flux and distance to the earth @xcite , single ad s expected sn@xmath1 event counts can be determined below , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the luminosity of electron - antineutrino emission and @xmath29 is the sn explosion distance to earth .",
    "@xmath30 is the single ad s expected sn@xmath1 event number in 10s - time - window corresponding to @xmath31 luminosity and @xmath32 distance .",
    "detection efficiency of sn@xmath1 is considered in @xmath30 .    here ,",
    "the supernova model for the detection probability calculation is set to sn1987a - type and a typical value for @xmath33 is @xmath58 at a distance of 10 kpc to earth .",
    "based on the expected sn@xmath1 events of each ad , the detection probability of a supernova explosion is calculated by summing up the probabilities of the combination cases that pass the trigger threshold .",
    "notice that the single ad event rate increases simultaneously during a supernova explosion and coincidence signals in multiple ads occur more frequently . as a result",
    ", the detection probability of the sn explosion has been calculated as a function of distance to the earth .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : detectionprobability ] . from the `` 8-ad golden trigger ''",
    "line , the milky way center is around 8.5 kpc from the earth with a 100% detection probability and the most distant edge of the milky way is 23.5 kpc from the earth with a 94% detection probability .",
    "moreover , the silent trigger will add a potential 5% to 10% detection probability of sn explosion .",
    "particularly , the `` single detector '' line is comparable to the `` 8-ad golden trigger '' which obviously indicates the gain in sensitivity of the 8-ad configuration over a single detector .",
    "a rough estimation implies the daya bay is equivalent to a single 0.7 kton liquid scintillator detector with respect to the detection probability of sn explosion as a consequence of the multi - ad configuration .",

    ", the total number of sn@xmath1 events is exploited for trigger cut setting , for example , 10 sn@xmath1 events in 10s - time - window corresponding to 1/month false alarm rate threshold . while in the scenario of multi - detector ,",
    "the background combination case is exploited for trigger cut setting , for example , combination 0 - 0 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 1 - 0 - 0 corresponding to 1/month false alarm rate threshold .",
    "obviously , the total number of events in multi - detector here is 7 which is smaller than the single - detector , thus providing a higher detection probability .",
    "the supernova online trigger system in daya bay has been officially installed after several pretests .",
    "the extra workload to the current cpu consumption of daq is around 8% and is far from the computing maximum workload online .",
