    "suspensions of hard particles ( i.e. particles that interact via an infinitely strong , repulsive excluded - volume interaction potential ) have been successfully used as model systems for the statistical mechanics of liquids and solids for more than half a century . for this class of system phase transitions",
    "are entropy rather than enthalpy driven , and the relevant control parameters are the particle shape and concentration rather than temperature .",
    "hard ellipsoids are a simple model for systems whose macroscopic properties depend on the interplay of positional and orientational entropy such as liquid crystals @xcite and orientational glasses @xcite    in recent years it has been shown by computer simulations and experiments that randomly packed arrangements of hard ellipsoids can reach densities much higher than random close packing of spheres @xcite . at certain aspect ratios , random packing of ellipsoids can even reach densities almost as high as the closest crystalline packing of spheres @xcite .",
    "however , this does not imply that random packing of ellipsoids is as dense as their densest known crystalline packing . in 2004 ,",
    "donev and co - workers introduced a family of crystalline packings of ellipsoids , which reach a packing fraction of @xmath4 @xcite ( as compared to @xmath5 for the fcc packing of spheres and stacking variants thereof ) .    inspired by this study ,",
    "we re - examined the phase diagram of hard ellipsoids @xcite .",
    "we found that the stretched fcc - phase , which had before been assumed to be the stable crystalline phase @xcite , was unstable with respect to a different crystalline phase .",
    "the more stable structure has a simple monoclinic unit cell containing two ellipsoids of unequal orientation ( sm2)(cf .",
    "fig [ fig : intro1 ] ) .",
    "the packings constructed by donev and co - workers @xcite are a special case of sm2 ( the infinite - pressure limit ) .    at that time we did , however , not compute free energy differences between sm2 and stretched - fcc . in the present article we report on monte carlo simulations in which sm2 and stretched - fcc are connected to their respective harmonic crystals ( `` einstein crystals '' ) via thermodynamic integration , and hence their free energies are determined . in order to sample the thermodynamic integration pathway , we adapted the wang - landau algorithm @xcite . in the original wang - landau scheme a flat histogram of the internal energy",
    "is constructed .",
    "here we constructed a flat histogram of the coupling parameter that couples the hard ellipsoid model to the einstein crystal , instead .",
    "in order to determine which of two phases is thermodynamically more stable , one compares their relevant thermodynamic potentials , e.g.  in the case of constant particle number @xmath6 , volume @xmath7 and temperature @xmath8 their free energies @xmath9 . within a mc simulation , however , for most models",
    "it is impossible to compute @xmath9 because of its direct connection to the accessible phase space volume ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) . to solve this problem the method of thermodynamic integration ( ti ) @xcite is commonly used , in which the free energy difference between the system of interest and a reference system can be calculated by introducing an artificial external potential @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 here , the parameter @xmath14 $ ] links the interaction potential of the system of interest @xmath15 to the potential of the reference system @xmath16 by @xmath17    during a typical integration , @xmath18 is gradually switched on and at the same time @xmath19 is gradually switched off",
    "however , the hard - core interaction of the ellipsoids does not allow for a gradual change .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 is imposed in a first step , and then @xmath19 is gradually switched off in a second . with this procedure , the free energy of the system can be calculated as @xmath20 , where the subscripts refer to the two steps just described .",

    "the remaining particle is fixed in space and is called the carrier of the lattice .",
