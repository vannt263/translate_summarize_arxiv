    "the effect of quenched randomness on the equilibrium and dynamic properties of macroscopic systems is a subject of great theoretical and practical interest .",
    "it is well known that quenched bond randomness may produce drastic changes on phase transitions depending on the type of the transition  @xcite .",
    "thus , symmetry - breaking first - order transitions are converted to second - order phase transitions by infinitesimal bond randomness for spatial dimensionality @xmath0  @xcite and by bond randomness beyond a threshold strength in @xmath1  @xcite , as indicated by general arguments  @xcite and in some cases by rigorous mathematical work  @xcite .",
    "in particular , this rounding effect of first - order transitions has now been rigorously established in a unified way in low dimensions ( @xmath2 ) including a large variety of types of randomness in classical and quantum spin systems  @xcite .",
    "historically , the effects of disorder on phase transitions have been studied in two extreme cases , i.e. in the limits of weak and strong ( near the percolation point ) disorder .",
    "the first important conjecture , known today as the harris criterion  @xcite , relates the value of the specific heat exponent @xmath3 in a continuous transition with the expected effects of uncorrelated weak disorder in ferromagnets . according to the harris criterion , for continuous phase transitions with a negative exponent @xmath3",
    ", the introduction of weak randomness is expected to be an irrelevant field and the disordered system to remain in the same universality class . on the other hand ,",
    "the weakly disordered system is expected to be in a different universality class in the case of a pure system having a positive exponent @xmath3 .",
    "pure systems with a zero specific heat exponent ( @xmath4 ) are marginal cases of harris criterion ( since the criterion does not give any information ) and their study , upon the introduction of disorder , has been of particular interest .",
    "the paradigmatic model of the marginal case is , of course , the general random 2d ising model ( random - site , random - bond , and bond - diluted ) and this model has been extensively investigated and debated  @xcite .",
    "several recent studies , both analytical ( renormalization group and conformal field theories ) and numerical ( mainly monte carlo ( mc ) simulations ) devoted to this model , have provided very strong evidence in favor of the so - called logarithmic corrections s scenario . according to this ,",
    "the effect of infinitesimal disorder gives rise to a marginal irrelevance of randomness and besides logarithmic corrections , the critical exponents maintain their 2d ising values .",
    "in particular , the specific heat is expected to slowly diverge with a double - logarithmic dependence  @xcite .",
    "here , we should mention that there is not full agreement in the literature and a different scenario predicts a negative specific heat exponent @xmath3 leading to a saturating behavior  @xcite , with a corresponding correlation length exponent @xmath5  @xcite .    in general , a unitary and rigorous physical description of critical phenomena in disordered systems still lacks and certainly , lacking such a description , the study of further models for which there is a general agreement in the the behavior of the corresponding pure cases is very important .",
    "historically , such a suitable candidate for testing the above predictions , that has been also quite extensively studied , is the general 2d @xmath6-state potts model  @xcite .",
    "this model includes the ising model ( @xmath7 ) , cases of a pure system having continuous transitions with a positive exponent @xmath3 ( @xmath8 ) and also the large @xmath6-cases ( @xmath9 ) for which one could observe and try to classify the above mentioned softening of first - order transitions in 2d models .",
    "another similarly interesting candidate , not yet as much studied in the random - bond version , is the 2d blume - capel ( bc ) model  @xcite .",
    "we may note here that most of the existing literature on the bc model with randomness concerns randomness applied to the crystal field and/or spin glass exchange interactions  @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the pure version of the bc model undergoes an ising - like continuous phase transition to an ordered ferromagnetic phase as the temperature is lowered for crystal - field couplings less than a tricritical value and a first - order transition for larger values of the crystal - field coupling .",
    "therefore , this model provides also the opportunity to study two different and very interesting topics of the above described effects of disorder in critical phenomena , namely the double - logarithmic scenario for the specific heat in the regime where the 2d bc model is in the same universality class with the 2d random - bond ising model and also the softening of the transition in the first - order regime .",
    "recently the present authors  @xcite have considered this model and provided strong numerical evidence clarifying two of the above mentioned effects induced in 2d systems by bond randomness . by implementing a two - stage wang - landau ( wl ) approach  @xcite , we presented essentially exact information on the 2d bc model under quenched bond randomness . in this investigation",
    ", we found dramatically different critical behaviors of the second - order phase transitions emerging from the first- and second - order regimes of the pure bc model and since , these second - order transitions were found to have different critical exponents , our study indicated an interesting strong violation of universality  @xcite .",
    "namely , different sets of critical exponents on two segments of the same critical line appeared to describe the two regimes : still - second - order and ex - first - order .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend our earlier work  @xcite , by implementing essentially the same two - stage wl approach ( sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] ) and try to give a more complete picture by concentrating in the weak ( still - second - order ) regime and simulate the model for several disorder strengths and many values of the crystal - field coupling .",
    "the above statement means that , effectively we will restrict our study to moderate values of the crystal field and moderate values of the disorder , intending to observe the frontier between the weak- and the strong - disorder universality classes from the disappearance of the expected 2d random ising universality class behavior .",
    "thus , in sec .  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we will produce phase diagram points for the random - bond model but also for the pure model , reporting for the pure case a comparison with existing estimates in the literature .",
    "more generally , in carrying out this project we have also considered the pure 2d bc model for several values of the crystal - field , in the second - order regime , observing its finite - size scaling ( fss ) behavior .",
    "[ sec:4 ] presents such a comparative study between random and pure models concerning the behavior of all thermodynamic parameters used in the traditional fss analysis of mc data .",
    "this study enables us to observe some peculiarities of the pure model , due to the onset of tricriticality , and compare them with the corresponding behavior of the random model .",
    "furthermore , we try to focus , understand and shed light to the extent of universality of the random - bond 2d bc model with the corresponding random - bond ising model , for which the scenario of logarithmic corrections seems to be the strongest option in the current literature  @xcite .",
    "the prediction of the range of such universality is far from trivial and the two regimes ( weak and strong ) have many dissimilarities which are also reflected in the ground - state structure , as further discussed below .",
    "the attempt to estimate the range of the above mentioned universality is accomplished by the novel idea which assumes the truth of the double logarithmic scenario for the specific heat in a suitable restricted range .",
    "this is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] together with some further crucial observations concerning the behavior of the strong disorder regime , i.e. the regime where the ising class universality does not apply and the system has a rather complex and yet not understood behavior .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",

    "the ( pure ) bc model  @xcite is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath10 where the spin variables @xmath11 take on the values @xmath12 , or @xmath13 , @xmath14 indicates summation over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites , and @xmath15 is the ferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is known as the crystal - field coupling and to fix the temperature scale we set @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as it is well known , this model has been analyzed , besides the original mean - field theory  @xcite , by a variety of approximations and numerical approaches .",

    "[ sec:3 ] ) .",
    "details of our simulations are summarized in the next section together with an up to date brief sketch of our entropic scheme .      in the last few years",
    "we have used an entropic sampling implementation of the wl algorithm  @xcite to study some simple  @xcite , but also some more complex systems  @xcite",
    ". one basic ingredient of this implementation is a suitable restriction of the energy subspace for the implementation of the wl algorithm .",
    "this was originally termed as the critical minimum energy subspace ( crmes ) restriction  @xcite and it can be carried out in many alternative ways , the simplest being that of observing the finite - size behavior of the tails of the energy probability density function ( e - pdf ) of the system  @xcite .",
    "complications that may arise in random systems can be easily accounted for by various simple modifications that take into account possible oscillations in the e - pdf and expected sample - to - sample fluctuations of individual disorder realizations . in our recent papers  @xcite , we have presented details of various sophisticated routes for the identification of the appropriate energy subspace @xmath29 for the entropic sampling of each random realization . in estimating the appropriate subspace from a chosen pseudocritical temperature one should be careful to account for the shift behavior of other important pseudocritical temperatures and extend the subspace appropriately from both low- and high - energy sides in order to achieve an accurate estimation of all finite - size anomalies .",
    "of course , taking the union of the corresponding subspaces , insures accuracy for the temperature region of all studied pseudocritical temperatures .",
    "the up to date version of our implementation uses a combination of several stages of the wl process .",
    "first , we carry out a starting ( or preliminary ) multi - range ( multi - r ) stage , in a very wide energy subspace .",
    "this preliminary stage is performed up to a certain level of the wl random walk .",
    "the wl refinement is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the density of states ( dos ) and we follow the usual modification factor adjustment @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the preliminary stage may consist of the levels : @xmath34 and to improve accuracy the process may be repeated several times .",
    "however , in repeating the preliminary process and in order to be efficient , we use only the levels @xmath35 after the first attempt , using as starting dos the one obtained in the first random walk at the level @xmath36 . from our experience , this practice is almost equivalent of simulating the same number of independent wl random walks . also in our recent studies we have found out that is much more efficient and accurate to loosen up the originally applied very strict flatness criteria  @xcite .",
    "thus , a variable flatness process starting at the first levels with a very loose flatness criteria and assuming at the level @xmath37 the original strict flatness criteria is now days used . after the above described preliminary multi - r stage , in the wide energy subspace",
    ", one can proceed in a safe identification of the appropriate energy subspace using one or more alternatives outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite . in random systems , where one needs to simulate many disorder realizations ,",
    "it is also possible and advisable to avoid the identification of the appropriate energy subspace separately for each disorder realization by extrapolating from smaller lattices and/or by prediction from preliminary runs on small numbers of disorder realizations . in any case",
    ", the appropriate subspaces should be defined with sufficient tolerances . in our implementation",
    "we use such advance information to proceed in the next stages of the entropic sampling .",
    "the process continues in two further stages ( two - stage process ) , using now mainly high iteration levels , where the modification factor is very close to unity and there is not any significant violation of the detailed balance condition during the wl process .",
    "these two stages are suitable for the accumulation of histogram data ( for instance energy - magnetization histograms ) , which can be used for an accurate entropic calculation of non - thermal thermodynamic parameters , such us the order parameter and its susceptibility  @xcite . in the first ( high - level )",
    "stage , we follow again a repeated several times ( typically @xmath38 ) multi - r wl approach , carried out now only in the restricted energy subspace .",
    "the wl levels may be now chosen as @xmath39 and as an appropriate starting dos for the corresponding starting level the average dos of the preliminary stage at the starting level may be used .",
    "finally , the second ( high - level ) stage is applied in the refinement wl levels @xmath40 ( typically @xmath41 ) , where we usually test both an one - range ( one - r ) or a multi - r approach with large energy intervals . in the case of the one - r approach",
    "we have found very convenient and in most cases more accurate to follow the belardinelli and pereyra  @xcite adjustment of the wl modification factor according to the rule @xmath42 . finally , it should be also noted that by applying in our scheme a separate accumulation of histogram data in the starting multi - r stage ( in the wide energy subspace ) offers the opportunity to inspect the behavior of all basic thermodynamic functions in an also wide temperature range and not only in the neighborhood of the finite - size anomalies .",
    "the approximation outside the dominant energy subspace is not of the same accuracy with that of the restricted dominant energy subspace but is good enough for the observation of the general behavior and provides also a route of inspecting the degree of approximation .",
    "the above described numerical approach was used to estimate the properties of a large number of @xmath43 bond disorder realizations , for lattice sizes @xmath44 for all crystal fields and disorder strengths used in this paper , with the exception of the case @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 disorder realizations were simulated for lattice sizes @xmath48 . for reference and contrast ,",
    "the pure - system s properties were also obtained by the same implementation , simulating in each case at least @xmath49 independent runs .",
    "we close this outline of our numerical scheme with some comments concerning statistical errors and disorder averaging . even for the larger lattice size studied here ( @xmath50 ) , and depending on the thermodynamic parameter",
    ", the statistical errors of the wl method were found to be of reasonable magnitude and in some cases to be of the order of the symbol sizes , or even smaller .",
    "this was true for both the pure version and the individual random - bond realizations .",

    "the rest of table  [ tab:1 ] contains our estimates for the random - bond versions .",
    "one may note from this table that for small values of @xmath16 for instance @xmath45 the corresponding critical temperatures decrease as the disorder becomes stronger ( compare the three cases of disorder : @xmath53 , @xmath62 , and @xmath69 at this value of the crystal field ) . on the other hand , for @xmath70 the trend",
    "is reversed as can be seen by comparing the corresponding three cases of disorder .",
    "apparently this is a kind of reflection of the phenomenon of the enhancement of ferromagnetic order which appears to influence the geometry of the critical surface for the 2d random - bond bc model .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , in our recent investigation of the 2d random - bond bc model  @xcite we found dramatically different critical behaviors of the second - order phase transitions emerging from the first- and second - order regimes of the pure model .",
    "namely , different sets of critical exponents on two segments of the same critical line appeared to describe the two regimes : the still - second - order and ex - first - order regimes .",
    "the study in ref .",
    "@xcite was carried out for two values of the crystal - field coupling corresponding to the second - order ( @xmath26 ) and first - order ( @xmath27 ) regimes of the pure model and for the random version the disorder strength @xmath62 was chosen in both cases .",
    "the strong violation of universality observed appeared to be the result of the softening of the first - order transition due to bond - randomness .",
    "specifically , it was concluded that the new strong - disorder universality class is well described by a correlation length exponent in the range @xmath71 , and exponent ratios @xmath72 and @xmath73 very close to the ising values @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the above weak universality  @xcite seems to be valid between the ising - like continuous transitions of the random - bond 2d bc model for small values of @xmath16 ( @xmath76 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and continuous transitions belonging to the strong - disorder universality class .",
    "therefore , the strong - disorder universality class may be characterized by the above distinct value of the correlation length exponent and a strong saturation of the specific heat .",
    "qualitatively this saturating behavior is quite instructive and for illustrative reasons is reproduced here in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "this figure contrasts , at @xmath27 , the specific heat s finite - size behavior of the pure 2d bc model ( first - order regime ) and two disordered cases corresponding to disorder strengths @xmath77 and @xmath62 .",
    "the saturation of the specific heat is very clear in both cases of the disorder strength .",
    "it is of interest to point out here that these findings for the strong - disorder universality class appear to be fully compatible with the classification of phase transitions in disordered systems proposed recently by wu  @xcite . according to this classification",
    "the strong - disorder transition is expected to be inhomogeneous and percolative with an expected exponent of the order @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested to us by wu  @xcite , that the strong lack of self - averaging of this transition stems from the above properties .",
    "this violation of self - averaging , together with the strong finite - size effects , make the systematic mc approach of the strong - disorder regime very demanding , if not impractical . on the other hand ,",
    "the weak regime ( or ising universality regime ) suffers a much weaker lack of self - averaging , by at least a factor of @xmath79  @xcite , and a smooth behavior is observed at moderate lattice sizes .",
    "thus , aiming here to observe , even approximately , the extent of the involved universality classes we carried out our study at moderate values of the crystal field and disorder , and found a behavior quite convincing from which the frontier of the strong universality class can be estimated by observing the disappearance of the expected 2d random ising universality class .",
    "let us now proceed with the analysis of our numerical data for the disorder strengths and crystal fields given in table  [ tab:1 ] and observe and contrast their fss behavior with that of the pure model .",
    "starting this comparative study with the fss of the specific heat maxima ( using for the random - bond version at the strength @xmath62 the corresponding quantity averaged over disorder , i.e. @xmath80_{av}^{\\ast}$ ] ) , we present in fig .

    "[ fig:1](b ) by the simultaneous fitting of the six pseudocritical temperatures .",
    "as can be seem from this figure the estimate for the exponent @xmath89 , in the case @xmath54 , is closer to the expected tricritical value @xmath90",
    "@xcite , than to the 2d ising value @xmath91 .",
    "( a ) fss analysis of the three logarithmic derivatives ( @xmath58 ) of the order parameter with respect to temperature for a particular crystal field @xmath92 and disorder strength @xmath62 .",
    "( b ) traditional fss analysis of the order parameter at the estimated critical temperature for the same value of crystal field and disorder strength , as in panel ( a).,width=8 ]",
    "from fig .  [ fig:4](a ) one can observe the expected ising logarithmic divergence of the specific heat maxima .",
    "avoiding the value @xmath54 , which suffers from strong cross - over effects , we attempted to estimate the tricritical value of the crystal field by fitting the decreasing logarithmic amplitudes @xmath93 to a suitable power law , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "this may appear a naive or questionable idea , since the behavior of specific heat data is the achilles heel of fss analysis .",
    "yet , fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] shows that besides the large fluctuations ( errors ) in logarithmic amplitudes @xmath93 , one could approximately estimate the tricritical crystal field @xmath94 , as shown in the panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) we observe again that , the specific heat maxima , corresponding now to the random - bond model at the disorder strength @xmath62 , are better - matched to the double - logarithmic divergence than the corresponding specific heat maxima of the pure model to a simple logarithmic divergence",
    ". therefore , it appears realistic to try to obtain the multicritical point ( more precisely the value of the crystal field @xmath95 where we expect the emergence of strong - disorder regime at a given disorder strength ) , where the 2d random - bond ( bc ) ising universality class meets the strong - disorder universality class , by fitting the decreasing double - logarithmic amplitudes to a similar power law .",
    "simultaneous fitting to a simple power law of the averaged peaks corresponding to the absolute order - parameter derivative for three values of @xmath16 and disorder strength @xmath96 .",
    "the fitting provides an estimate of the exponent @xmath97 and as indicated in the panel an alternative estimate for the exponent ratio @xmath73 , by assuming @xmath91.,width=8 ]    figure  [ fig:9 ] presents now these fittings and also the estimated multicritical values of the crystal field @xmath95 for the three disorder strengths considered in this paper .",
    "the statistical errors of the corresponding double logarithmic amplitudes @xmath93 are seen to be quite smaller , compared to the corresponding amplitudes of the pure model , and the estimated values of the values of the multicritical field , shown in the panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , appear more convincing . from their general trend",
    "we observe that as we increase the disorder strength the frontier of the strong - disorder universality class moves to lower values of the crystal field , namely : ( @xmath53 , @xmath98 ) , ( @xmath62 , @xmath99 ) , and ( @xmath69 , @xmath100 ) .",
    "this behavior seems sensible and in our opinion reflects the competition between the ferromagnetic random interactions with the crystal field , giving a kind of destabilization of the usual ising - like ferromagnetic order .",
    "a similar ground - state reflection of this competition is a ground - state structure of unsaturated ferromagnetic ground states discussed in our recent paper  @xcite .",
    "conversely , as disorder strength is decreased , @xmath95 approaches @xmath101 , as expected .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the strong lack of self - averaging , together with possible strong finite - size effects , make the mc approach to the strong - disorder regime a very difficult task .",
    "the self - averaging properties along the two segments ( ex - first - order and still - second - order ) of the critical line were observed and discussed in ref .",
    "it was shown in this paper that the usual finite - size measure  @xcite of relative variance @xmath102_{av}^{2}$ ] , where @xmath103_{av}-[x]_{av}^{2}$ ] ( and @xmath104 is the susceptibility maxima ) , exhibits lack of self - averaging in both cases of marginal second - order transition and the transition in the strong - disorder or ex - first - order regime .",
    "in particular , it was shown  @xcite that the case studied ( @xmath27 ) of the ex - first - order segment gives a much larger effect when compared with the still - second - order regime at @xmath26 and the same disorder strength @xmath62 by a factor of @xmath105 .     an approximate estimation of the tricritical value of the crystal field by fitting the decreasing logarithmic amplitudes @xmath83 of the pure model at suitable values of the crystal - field coupling to a suitable power law shown in the figure.,width=8 ]    therefore , phase diagram points very close to the frontier of the strong - disorder regime may be the worst cases to study , because , besides the very strong lack of self - averaging one may also expect large finite - size and cross - over effects .",
    "however , such cases are elucidatory not only for observing the intrinsic difficulties but also for giving us the opportunity to reflect on possible links with basic properties of the system as for instance the ground - state structure .    thus , fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] illustrates two important characteristics of the case @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig:10](a ) shows the huge sample - to - sample fluctuations in all the pseudocritical temperatures used in this paper .",
    "the simulation here was extended to larger lattices ( @xmath48 ) and the number of realizations studied was @xmath47 , to be compared with @xmath43 realizations studied in previous sections ( weak - regime ) .",
    "besides the enormous fluctuations , the number of @xmath47 realizations looks quite insufficient and strong finite - size effects , reflected as expected in the shift behavior of the system , produce a completely unsettled behavior .",
    "figure  [ fig:10](b ) illustrates an unusual deviating behavior between the finite - size behavior of the maxima of the averaged specific heat curves ( @xmath80_{av}^{\\ast}$ ] ) and the finite - size behavior of the average of individual maxima ( @xmath106_{av}$ ] ) , which as shown suffer large sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "the behavior here resembles in many aspects the well known and still challenging specific heat behavior of the 3d random - field ising model  @xcite .",
    "however , a very clear tendency of @xmath80_{av}^{\\ast}$ ] for a saturating behavior is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:10](b ) and we may speculate that this saturating behavior is the correct asymptotic behavior for both maxima shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10](b ) , although the behavior of @xmath106_{av}$ ] will settle down only in very large lattice sizes , when the influence of the strong finite - size effects on the individual maxima will diminish .",
    "estimation of multicritical values of the crystal field , where the 2d random - bond ( bc ) ising universality class meets the strong - disorder universality class .",
    "the decreasing double logarithmic amplitudes @xmath83 of the random version has been fitted to a power law shown and the estimates for the three disorder strengths are shown in the panel.,width=8 ]    the above illustrations open the possibility that the case @xmath45 and @xmath46 is very close to the frontier of the strong - universality class .",
    "this is in accordance with the trend observed in the previous section and can be further supported by reproducing here some aspects of the ground - state structure of the 2d random - bond bc model . from fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] , reproduced here from ref .",
    "@xcite , one can see that approximately at this point ( @xmath107 ) , the system departs from the ferromagnetic ground state and an unsaturated ground state is produced , which is further enhanced with vacant sites ( @xmath108 ) as we increase the disorder strength . in the presence of bond randomness the competition between the ferromagnetic interactions with the crystal field results in a destabilization of the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "depending on the realization , weak clusters exist in @xmath109 and their points are frozen in the @xmath108 state .",
    "this is an interesting subject , which is presently under further consideration in both 2d and 3d by the present authors .",
    "the novel behavior illustrated in fig .  [ fig:10 ] appears now as a consequence of the onset of the unsaturated ground state at @xmath110 which is thus related with the critical behavior of the 2d random - bond bc model .",
    "the presented calculation of the ground states has be carried out in polynomially bounded computing time by mapping the system into a network and searching for a minimum cut by using a maximum flow algorithm ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) and can be easily extended to large lattices and also to the 3d bc random - bond model .",
    "finite - size behavior for the case @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "( a ) behavior of the averaged pseudocritical temperatures , corresponding to individual maxima , with an illustration of the huge sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "( b ) behavior of the maxima of the averaged specific heat curves ( @xmath80_{av}^{\\ast}$ ] ) and the average of individual maxima ( @xmath106_{av}$ ] ) with their large sample - to - sample fluctuations.,width=8 ]",
    "by carrying out an extensive two - stage wang - landau entropic sampling of both the pure and the random - bond 2d blume - capel model we have produced phase diagram points for several disorder strengths . also for the pure model we found an excellent coincidence of our points with those of beale  @xcite . for a particular disorder strength ( @xmath62 ) we found that , as a result of the enhancement of ferromagnetic order , the phase diagram of the random version crosses that of the pure model at approximately the point @xmath67 , well before the tricritical point .",
    "the critical properties of the pure model were compared and contrasted to those of the random model and for moderate values of the crystal field and disorder we found that the ising universality scenario ( with possible logarithmic corrections ) is well obtained in the case of the random version .",
    "furthermore , accepting in this range of couplings the assumption of the double logarithmic scenario for the specific heat we estimated multicritical points , where the 2d random - bond ( bc ) ising universality class meets the strong - disorder universality class .",
    "the behavior of the strong disorder regime was also critically discussed . the case @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "was extensively studied and based on the observed behavior and on the ground - state observations we suggested that this case , most likely , lies on the frontier between the weak- and strong - disorder universality classes , suffering exceptionally strong finite - size effects and a strong lack of self - averaging .    in conclusion ,",
    "the present paper investigated some difficult and important aspects of the random - bond 2d blume - capel model .",
    "it has been pointed out that the behavior of this system is very interesting and in particular the strong - disorder regime may include many further challenges and open problems that , at the moment , are not fully understood . in our opinion",
    ", this is a rather complex subject deserving further research .",
