    "in this paper , we consider the problem of controlling the outbreak of an epidemic process in a networked population in the absence of a social planner . we propose a distributed solution that enables local computation of optimal investment in vaccines and/or antidotes at each node , to respectively reduce its infection rate and increase its recovery rate ; and contain the spread of an outbreak .",
    "our distributed solution is based on an iterative algorithm  a _ distributed alternating direction method of multipliers _ ( d - admm ) algorithm .",
    "the distributed solution framework presented here is based on a geometric programming formulation of the epidemic control problem , and its convex characterization first proposed in @xcite .",
    "the fairly recent outbreaks of the middle eastern respiratory syndrome ( mers ) virus @xcite and ebola virus @xcite have rekindled interest in analysis and control of epidemic outbreaks in networked populations .",
    "the analysis of an sis epidemic process in arbitrary ( undirected ) networks was first studied by wang et al .",
    "@xcite using a discrete - time model .",
    "key in @xcite was the establishment of an epidemic threshold based on the spectral radius of the network adjacency matrix .",
    "ganesh et al . in @xcite studied a continuous - time sis epidemic model where the relation between the spectral radius of the network adjacency matrix and the speed of spreading was further corroborated .",
    "a similar result was proposed in @xcite .    in the event of an epidemic outbreak , of interest",
    "is how to optimally allocate vaccines and/or antidotes across the the population to control the spread of the epidemic .",
    "sometimes , the focus is to hasten the rate at which the contagion is contained ; or to minimize the associated cost of containing the outbreak .",
    "significant research attention has been given to this problem in the last decade .",
    "in @xcite , the authors proposed a greedy immunization strategy  immunizing acquaintances , and showed it outperforms a case where vaccinations are applied randomly across nodes in the network . in @xcite",
    "the authors presented an analysis of immunization strategy using the pagerank vector of the network adjacency matrix .",
    "wan et al . in @xcite",
    "presented a method to design control strategies in undirected networks using eigenvalue sensitivity analysis . a convex framework to compute the optimal allocation of vaccines in undirected networks using semidefinite programming ( sdp ) techniques",
    "was discussed in @xcite . in @xcite , we generalized the convex formulation via geometric programming techniques to weighted , directed , strongly connected networks to compute the cost and speed optimal allocation of vaccines and/or antidotes in directed strongly ( and not necessarily strongly ) connected networks .    in the absence of a social planner ( or central coordinator ) , centralized computation of optimal investments in vaccines and/or antidotes as was done in @xcite poses a challenge .",
    "furthermore , the network might be too large for a centralized optimization scheme .",
    "these motivate the need for an optimal , decentralized framework to achieve the network - wide objective of controlling an outbreak . in this paper , we propose a fully distributed admm algorithm that enables local computation of optimal investment in vaccines and/or antidotes at each node to control the spread of an outbreak in a directed , network comprising heterogeneous agents .",
    "while the discussion in this paper focuses on strongly connected networks , the results are easily amenable to networks that are not necessarily strongly connected .",
    "we formulate the epidemic control problem as a distributed resource allocation problem , in that agents in the network carry out local computations informed by interactions with neighboring agents to determine their optimal investment in vaccines and/or antidotes , and must cooperate to complete a global task .",
    "our work is similar in spirit to @xcite where tests for distributed control of positive systems were presented .",
    "a notable difference and major challenge between the particular problems addressed in @xcite and this paper is that our problem in its natural form is a nonconvex optimization problem .",
    "a game - theoretic formulation has also been studied in @xcite where different equilibria were analyzed for undirected networks , contrasting our distributed solution that applies to directed networks with non - identical agents .",
    "distributed optimization methods exist in the literature and have applied to several classes of problems ; see , for example @xcite .",
    "we employ a d - admm , a dual - based method , to solve our constrained resource allocation problem .",
    "dual - based methods are usually used when the local optimization of each agent can be done efficiently .",
    "the d - admm , as we will illustrate , first decomposes our original resource allocation problem into two sub - problems .",
    "these sub - problems are then sequentially solved in parallel by each agent , with the associated dual variables updated at each iteration of the algorithm , allowing for a fully distributed implementation .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , where a d - admm algorithm was proposed for an unconstrained optimization problem on an undirected network , our problem in its original form is a constrained optimization problem on a directed network , where the need for satisfaction of a global constraint is necessary .",

    "we assume the agents are non - identical in the sense that each agent has distinct infection rate @xmath34 and recovery rate @xmath35 ; and that these rates can be controlled by either injecting vaccines or antidotes .",

    "we focus on a _ rate - constrained _ resource allocation problem , in which the objective is to find the cost - optimal , local allocation of vaccines and antidotes to achieve a given network - wide exponential decay rate in the probability of infection .",
