    "precise measurements of neutron @xmath0-decay observables determine fundamental parameters of the weak interaction and contribute to tests of the standard model @xcite .",
    "because the momentum transfer in neutron @xmath0-decay ( @xmath5 kev ) is small compared to the @xmath6 mass , the decay can be modeled as a four - fermion contact interaction with an amplitude under the standard model given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fermi weak coupling constant , @xmath9 is the weak - quark - mixing ckm matrix element , and @xmath10 is the leptonic weak vector and axial - vector current . in its most general form ,",
    "the hadronic weak vector and axial - vector ( @xmath11 ) current includes six form factors @xcite ,    @xmath12u_n , \\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the four - momentum transfer ; @xmath14 is the nucleon mass ; and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the vector , weak magnetism , induced scalar , axial vector , induced tensor , and induced pseudoscalar form factors , respectively . in the limit of @xmath21 ,",
    "the hadronic weak current is dominated by the weak vector and axial vector coupling constants of the nucleon , defined to be the values of the vector and axial vector form factors at @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . under the conserved vector current ( cvc )",
    "hypothesis of the standard model and the assumption of isospin symmetry , the vector coupling constant is @xmath25 ( independent of the nuclear medium ) .",
    "isospin - symmetry - breaking effects to the value of @xmath26 in neutron @xmath0-decay have been calculated in chiral perturbation theory , with the correction to @xmath26 found to be at a negligible @xmath27 level @xcite . also per the cvc hypothesis , the weak magnetism coupling constant , @xmath28 , which appears at recoil order in the vector current , is related to the proton and neutron anomalous magnetic moments by @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast to the vector current , the axial - vector current is renormalized by the strong interaction such that the value of @xmath30 must be determined experimentally and also by lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) calculations .",
    "any contribution from the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant , @xmath31 , to neutron @xmath0-decay observables is expected to be negligibly small , with the contribution of @xmath31 to the energy spectrum calculated to be of order @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the two remaining terms , the induced scalar , @xmath17 , in the vector current , and the induced tensor , @xmath19 , in the axial - vector current , are termed second - class currents due to their transformation properties under @xmath33-parity . under the requirement of @xmath33-parity symmetry , both @xmath34 .",
    "however , @xmath33-parity symmetry is violated within the standard model due to differences in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 quarks charges and masses ( i.e. , isospin symmetry breaking effects ) . an estimate for @xmath37 including su(3 )",
    "breaking effects suggested @xmath38 in neutron @xmath0-decay to be @xmath39 @xcite , and an evaluation of @xmath40 using qcd sum rules found @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "finally , recent lattice qcd studies of su(3 ) breaking in semi - leptonic decays find small , @xmath42 , values for both @xmath17 and @xmath19 in neutron @xmath0-decay , but the results are statistically limited and consistent with zero at 12 standard deviations @xcite . however , despite these hints for non - zero values of these second - class currents , their contributions to neutron @xmath0-decay observables are again expected to be negligibly small , as they also appear at order @xmath43 in the energy spectrum @xcite .    therefore , under the assumption that any such contributions from @xmath31 , @xmath44 , and @xmath37 are negligibly small relative to the current level of experimental precision , it is clear that a description of neutron @xmath0-decay under the cvc hypothesis of the standard model requires the specification of only two parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath30 , given the high precision results for @xmath8 achieved in muon decay @xcite .",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath30 can be accessed via measurements of two different types of neutron @xmath0-decay observables : the lifetime , and angular correlation coefficients in polarized and unpolarized @xmath0-decay .",
    "the first of these , the lifetime , as calculated from the amplitude and integration over the allowed phase space , is of the form @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the electron mass and the parameter @xmath47 is defined to be the ratio of the axial vector and vector coupling constants , @xmath48 .",
    "the numerical value for the phase space factor of @xmath49 @xcite includes corrections for the fermi function , the finite nucleon mass , the finite nucleon radius , and the effect of recoil on the fermi function .",
    "the factor @xmath50 denotes the total effect of all electroweak radiative corrections , including the @xmath51 outer ( long - distance loop and bremsstrahlung effects ) and inner ( short distance , including axial - vector - current , loop effects ) radiative corrections ; an @xmath52 correction resulting from factorization of the fermi function ; and @xmath52 leading - log and next - to - leading - log corrections ( for lepton and quark loop insertions in the photon propagator ) @xcite .",
    "the total electroweak radiative correction has been calculated to be @xmath53 @xcite where the @xmath54 uncertainty was reduced by a factor of two ( from its previous value of @xmath55 @xcite ) after the development of a new method for calculating hadronic effects in the matching of long- and short - distance contributions to axial - vector current loop effects ( primarily from the @xmath56 box diagram ) .    the second type of observable , angular correlation coefficients , parametrize the angular correlations between the momenta of the decay products and the spin of the initial - state neutron . in general , the directional distribution of the electron and antineutrino momenta and the electron energy in polarized @xmath0-decay is of the form @xcite @xmath57 , \\label{eq : w_phase_space_distribution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) denote , respectively , the electron s ( antineutrino s ) total energy and momentum ; @xmath62 ( @xmath63 kev + @xmath46 ) is the electron endpoint energy ; and @xmath64 is the neutron polarization .",
    "the angular correlation coefficients @xmath65 ( @xmath66-@xmath67-asymmetry ) , @xmath68 ( @xmath0-asymmetry ) , and @xmath69 ( @xmath67-asymmetry ) are , to lowest order , functions only of @xmath47 where , under a @xmath70 sign convention , @xmath71    the contributions of terms in eq.([eq : w_phase_space_distribution ] ) proportional to the fierz interference term @xmath72 and the time - reversal - odd triple - correlation - coefficient @xmath73 are at recoil order for standard model interactions @xcite , and are negligible at the current level of experimental precision .",
    "note that to our knowledge , there are no published direct measurements of @xmath72 in neutron @xmath0-decay .",
    "as already noted , at lowest order @xmath74 , @xmath1 , and @xmath75 are functions only of @xmath47 .",
    "however , recoil - order corrections , including the effects of weak magnetism and @xmath26-@xmath30 interference , introduce energy - dependent corrections to the asymmetry , and are of @xmath76(1% ) for @xmath65 and @xmath68 @xcite and @xmath76(0.1% ) for @xmath69 @xcite . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the recoil - order corrections are of the explicit functional form @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and the @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) coefficients are functions only of @xmath47 and @xmath83 ( assuming @xmath84 , and negligible contributions from @xmath31 ) . under these assumptions , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "note that the @xmath88 dependence of the form factors does not appear until next - to - leading recoil order @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above recoil - order corrections , there is a small energy - dependent radiative correction ( for virtual and bremsstrahlung processes ) to polarized asymmetries , resulting in a @xmath89 correction to @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "after application of these recoil - order and radiative corrections , a value for @xmath47 can be extracted from @xmath74 , @xmath1 , and @xmath75 .",
    "note , however , that for a given ( relative ) statistical precision , the sensitivity of @xmath1 to @xmath47 is slightly higher than that of @xmath74 , and a factor of @xmath90 greater than that of @xmath75 , where at leading order the relative uncertainties compare as @xmath91    thus , measurements of the angular correlation coefficients determine a value for @xmath47 ( or @xmath30 , assuming @xmath25 under the cvc hypothesis ) , a fundamental parameter in the nucleon weak current .",
    "a precise value for @xmath30 is also important in many other contexts . in hadronic physics studies of the spin structure of the nucleon @xcite",
    ", the bjorken sum rule relates the difference in the first moments of the proton and neutron spin - dependent @xmath92 structure functions ( i.e. , isovector channel ) , as probed in polarized deep inelastic electron scattering , to @xmath30 . in qcd",
    ", the assumption of a partially conserved axial - vector current ( pcac ) , valid in the limit of a massless pion ( identified as the goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry ) , leads to the goldberger - treiman relation @xcite , relating the value of @xmath30 to the pion decay constant @xmath93 , the weak pion - nucleon - nucleon coupling constant @xmath94 , and the nucleon mass .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is also important in astrophysical processes , including calculations of solar fusion cross sections and rates , in particular , of the @xmath95 fusion reaction , impacting the solar neutrino flux for this process @xcite .",
    "high - precision experimental results for @xmath30 also serve as an important benchmark for theoretical calculations of @xmath30 , both in fundamental lattice qcd calculations @xcite and in relativistic constituent quark model calculations @xcite .",
    "a precise value for @xmath30 is also important as a phenomenological input parameter ( together with other low energy constants , such as the pion decay constant @xmath93 , the nucleon mass , etc . )",
    "to effective field theory calculations involving the axial vector current @xcite .",
    "although not a fundamental weak interaction parameter by itself , a precise value for the lifetime is important for big bang nucleosynthesis calculations , impacting the neutron - to - proton ratio and hence the primordial @xmath96he abundance at the time of freeze - out , when the weak reaction rate became less than the hubble expansion rate @xcite .",
    "the value of the lifetime is also important for the interpretation of data from neutrino oscillation experiments employing antineutrinos from reactors @xcite , which typically search for the reaction @xmath97 in detectors .",
    "the cross section for this reaction is inversely proportional to the neutron lifetime ; therefore , an accurate and precise experimental value for the lifetime is needed for an interpretation of measured detector antineutrino reaction rates in terms of the underlying neutrino oscillation physics .",
    "measurements of the lifetime and a value for @xmath47 from measurements of angular correlation coefficients permit the extraction of a value for @xmath9 solely from neutron @xmath0-decay observables according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lifetime - vud ] ) .",
    "although a value for @xmath9 from neutron @xmath0-decay @xcite is not yet competitive with the definitive value deduced from measurements of @xmath98 values in superallowed @xmath99 nuclear @xmath0-decay @xcite , the appeal of such an extraction is that it does not require corrections for isospin - symmetry - breaking and nuclear - structure effects .",
    "ultimately , when the precision on a neutron - based value for @xmath9 approaches the precision of the @xmath99 result , the two values must agree in the absence of new physics .",
    "however , given that the neutron - based value for @xmath9 is not yet competitive , one can treat the @xmath99 value for @xmath9 as a fixed input parameter , and instead perform a robust test of the consistency of the various measured neutron @xmath0-decay observables under the standard model .",
    "in particular , results for @xmath30 extracted from correlation coefficient measurements can then be directly compared with results from measurements of the neutron lifetime @xmath100 .",
    "finally , measurements of the angular correlation coefficients themselves are sensitive to beyond - the - standard - model physics , such as scalar and tensor interactions @xcite . with the projected improvements to the experimental precision in future years",
    ", neutron @xmath0-decay measurements will be sensitive to any such sources of new physics at energy scales rivaling those probed directly at the large hadron collider @xcite .",

    "other than the ucna experiment , all of the experiments have been performed with beams of polarized cold neutrons , with reported values for the polarization ranging from @xmath103 @xcite to @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "magnetic solenoidal spectrometers providing @xmath115 solid angle acceptance for detection of the decay electrons were employed in the perkeo @xcite and perkeo ii @xcite experiments at the institut laue - langevin ( ill ) .",
    "in contrast , the solid angle was defined by the geometric acceptance in an experiment at the petersburg nuclear physics institute ( pnpi ) @xcite in which the decay electrons and protons were detected in coincidence in detectors surrounding the beam decay region , and in an experiment at the ill @xcite which utilized a time projection chamber for reconstruction of the electron track .",
    "the current world average value for @xmath116 includes the most recent perkeo ii result reported in @xcite which accounted for correlations of systematic errors in the two separately published perkeo ii results @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite , but excludes the ucna proof - of - principle result @xcite .",
    "note that the current error bar of @xmath117 includes the particle data group s @xmath118 scaling @xcite . the need for this expanded error bar suggests an incomplete assessment of the systematic errors in one or more of the cold - neutron - based experiments .",
    "the ucna experiment , installed in area b of the los alamos neutron science center ( lansce ) at the los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) , was designed to perform the first - ever measurement of the neutron @xmath0-asymmetry parameter with ultracold neutrons ( ucn ) , and to - date is the only experimental measurement of any neutron @xmath0-decay angular correlation coefficient performed with ultracold neutrons ( ucn ) .",
    "ucn are defined to be neutrons with kinetic energies sufficiently low ( @xmath119 nev , corresponding to speeds @xmath120 m s@xmath121 ) such that they undergo total external reflection at any angle of incidence from an effective potential barrier ( a volume average of fermi potentials @xmath122 ) at the surfaces of certain materials @xcite .",
    "thus , ucn can be stored in material - walled vessels , whereas cold neutrons ( kinetic energies 0.0525 mev , speeds 1002200 m s@xmath121 ) must be transported along neutron guides at reflection angles less than the guide critical angle , resulting in short residency times in an apparatus .    a schematic diagram of the ucna experiment is shown in fig.[fig : ucna_schematic ] , and the basic principle of the experiment is as follows .",
    "spallation neutrons resulting from the interaction of a pulsed ( typically 0.2 hz ) 800 mev proton beam with a tungsten target were moderated in cold polyethylene to the cold neutron regime , and then downscattered to the ucn regime in a solid deuterium ( sd@xmath123 ) crystal .",
    "the ucn were then transported along a series of ucn guides through a 7.0-tesla solenoidal polarizing magnet , where the spin - dependent @xmath124 potential ( @xmath125 nev t@xmath121 ) served as a spin - state selector for magnetic moments @xmath126 oriented parallel to the direction of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath127 .",
    "the polarized ucn were then transported along non - magnetic ucn guides through an adiabatic - fast - passage ( afp ) spin - flipper 1.0-tesla field region , used to prepare ucn with spins either parallel or anti - parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the ucn were then directed to the center of a 12.4-cm diameter , 3-m long cylidrical decay storage volume located within the warm bore of a 1.0-t solenoidal spectrometer .",
    "emitted @xmath0-decay electrons then spiraled ( with a maximum larmor diameter of 7.76 mm for 782 kev endpoint electrons emitted perpendicular to the 1.0-t field ) along the magnetic field lines towards one of two electron detectors located on both ends of the spectrometer .    in principle , the @xmath0-asymmetry @xmath68 can be extracted from measurement of the @xmath128 angular distribution by forming an energy - dependent `` measured asymmetry '' , @xmath129 , of the detectors ( background - subtracted ) count rates , @xmath130 where @xmath131 denote the energy - dependent count rates observed in the two detectors , @xmath132 denotes the neutron polarization , @xmath0 denotes the electron velocity in units of @xmath133 , and @xmath134 is the average value of @xmath135 integrated over the detectors angular acceptance for that particular value of @xmath58 .",
    "note that for nominal values of @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , the experimental measured asymmetry is of order @xmath140 .    in practice",
    ", the asymmetry is extracted from ratios of the two detectors energy - dependent count rates for the two neutron spin states with polarizations oriented parallel and anti - parallel to the magnetic field via a `` super - ratio '' technique . here , the super - ratio , @xmath141 , is defined in terms of the measured energy - dependent detector count rates for the two spin states , @xmath142 , to be @xmath143 with the energy - dependent measured asymmetry , @xmath129 , then calculated from the super - ratio according to @xmath144 the merit of this super - ratio technique is that effects due to differences in the two detectors efficiencies and spin - dependent differences in the efficiencies for transport of the two ucn spin states into the spectrometer cancel to first order . in a binned analysis",
    ", energy - dependent detection efficiencies also largely cancel in the super - ratio , and are negligible for the energy bin sizes used in this work .    the motivation for the development of the ucna experiment was several - fold .",
    "first , the use of ucn in a neutron @xmath0-asymmetry experiment controls key neutron - related systematic corrections and uncertainties , including the neutron polarization and neutron - generated backgrounds .",
    "as discussed in detail later in this article , the polarization has been demonstrated to be @xmath145% at the 68% c.l .",
    ", with the precision , at present , limited only by statistics .",
    "further , neutron - generated backgrounds have been constrained to be negligible , a direct result of the relatively small number of neutrons present in the apparatus at any time , the small probability for their capture and subsequent generation of accompanying irreducible gamma ray backgrounds , and the fact that nearly all of the neutrons present in the apparatus are located within the spectrometer s decay volume . in the ucna experiment ,",
    "a relatively large fraction , @xmath146 , of the ucn stored in the decay volume contribute to the measured decay rate , whereas in cold neutron beam experiments typically only @xmath147 of the neutrons passing through the apparatus contribute to the decay rate @xcite .",
    "therefore , control of neutron - generated backgrounds is expected to be intrinsically more challenging in cold neutron beam experiments .",
    "second , as described in detail elsewhere @xcite , the electron detector system developed for the ucna experiment , consisting of a low - pressure multiwire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) backed by a plastic scintillator , provides position sensitivity , suppresses ambient gamma - ray backgrounds , and permits the reconstruction of low - energy - deposition electron backscattering events .",
    "the ucna experiment is the first neutron @xmath0-asymmetry experiment to employ a mwpc , providing the experiment with two critical advantages .",
    "first , the position information permits the definition of a fiducial volume on an event - by - event basis .",
    "second , the position information also permits for an event - by - event correction for the scintillator s position - dependent energy response .",
    "we now provide a more detailed description of the primary components of the ucna experiment .",
    "a detailed description of the design principles and performance of the lanl sd@xmath123 ucn source is given elsewhere @xcite ; therefore , we provide only a brief description here .",
    "protons from the 800 mev lansce accelerator were delivered in pulsed modes beam bursts separated by 0.05 s , with 5.2  s between each pulse s leading edge burst .",
    "] at a repetition rate of 0.2  hz to a tungsten spallation target , which was surrounded by a room - temperature beryllium reflector . with the spallation target operated in this pulsed mode , prompt beam related backgrounds can be eliminated with simple timing cuts , with negligible loss of duty factor for the @xmath0-decay measurements performed with the ucn stored in the electron spectrometer .",
    "the spallation neutrons were moderated in cold - helium - gas - cooled polyethylene ( maintained at a temperature of @xmath148 k for time - averaged proton beam currents of 5.8 @xmath149a ) located between the tungsten target and the beryllium reflector .",
    "the moderated cold neutrons were then downscattered to the ucn regime in a @xmath150 l cylindrical volume of ortho - state sd@xmath123 @xcite embedded at the bottom of a vertically - oriented cylindrical liquid - helium - cooled aluminum cryostat coated with @xmath151ni , presenting a nominal effective potential of 342 nev to the emerging ucn flux .",
    "the sd@xmath123 was maintained at temperatures @xmath152 k during the proton beam pulses on the spallation target .",
    "a butterfly - style `` flapper '' valve coated with @xmath151ni was located immediately above the sd@xmath123 volume .",
    "this `` flapper '' valve opened and subsequently closed ( with opening and closing response times of about 0.1 s ) with each proton pulse , in order to increase the storage lifetime of the ucn in the volume of the source above the sd@xmath123 volume . a typical ucn lifetime with the flapper open was @xmath153  s , whereas the lifetime with the flapper closed was @xmath154  s. the flapper leads to a corresponding increase in the ucn density .",
    "the ucn were then extracted from the source along horizontally - oriented 10.16-cm diameter stainless steel guides ( presenting a nominal potential of 189 nev ) through the biological shielding surrounding the source and out into the experimental area .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ucna_schematic ] , this system of guides through the biological shielding included two @xmath155 bends to eliminate neutrons with kinetic energies above the stainless steel guide potential .",
    "the maximum ucn density at the biological shield exit that we have obtained is @xmath156 @xmath157 @xcite , but for this work ( runs in 20082009 ) typical densities were @xmath158 @xmath157 .",
    "after exiting the biological shield , the ucn were transported along stainless steel guides through a gate valve , which served to separate the ucn source from the experiment , thus permitting measurements of backgrounds in the electron spectrometer detectors with the proton beam still operating in its normal pulsed mode , but no accompanying ucn transport to the spectrometer . a 6.0-t superconducting solenoidal pre - polarizing magnet ( ppm )",
    "was located immediately downstream of this gate valve .",
    "the ppm was included in the experiment design in order to minimize ucn transport losses through a thin ( 0.0254-mm thick ) zr foil which served to separate the vacuum in the sd@xmath123 source from the downstream vacuum in the remainder of the experiment .",
    "note that the ucn population was polarized after transport through the ppm s longitudinal magnetic field .    to preserve this initial polarization , 10.16-cm diameter electropolished cu guides ( nominal potential of 168 nev )",
    "were installed downstream of the ppm magnet .",
    "the ucn were then transported along these guides through a `` switcher '' valve , which allowed the downstream guides comprising the @xmath0-asymmetry measurement to be connected to either the upstream guides from the ucn source , or to a @xmath159he ucn detector @xcite used , as described later , for measurements of the depolarized population .",
    "these electropolished cu guides then transported the ucn through the primary 7.0-t polarizing magnet ( called the afp magnet ) .",
    "a 100-cm long quartz guide section coated with diamondlike carbon ( dlc ) @xcite passed through the center of a resonant ( 1.0-t ) `` bird - cage '' r.f .",
    "cavity @xcite , used for adiabatic fast passage ( afp ) spin - flipping of the ucn .",
    "downstream of this dlc - coated quartz guide , another section of 10.16-cm diameter cu guide transitioned to a 7-cm ( vertical ) @xmath160 4-cm ( horizontal ) rectangular cu guide , which transported the ucn through a horizontal penetration in the 1.0-t solenoidal electron spectrometer coil into the decay trap .",
    "permanent magnets were attached to the outer surfaces of the rectangular guide in order to suppress majorana spin - reorientations @xcite of neutrons passing through `` field zeros '' in the 1.0-t solenoidal spectrometer s field .",
    "the ucn rate along the transport guide system was monitored with @xmath159he ucn detectors @xcite at two key locations : at the gate valve ( for monitoring of the sd@xmath123 source performance ) , and slightly downstream of the apf spin flipper ( for monitoring of the afp spin - flipping efficiency ) .",
    "these @xmath159he ucn detectors were coupled to the guide system via small ( 0.64-cm diameter ) holes in the bottom of the guides .",
    "note that the ucn density in the spectrometer for the spin - flipped state was smaller than that for the unflipped state , because of losses ( after the 2.0-t @xmath161 energy boost associated with the spin flip ) in the transport guides located between the afp spin - flip region and the electron spectrometer .",
    "the measured @xmath0-decay rates for the spin - flipped state were @xmath162% smaller than those for the non - spin - flipped state .",
    "the maximum neutron @xmath0-decay rates measured in the spectrometer during the 20082009 runs correspond to a stored density of approximately 1  @xmath157 in the decay trap .",
    "major sources of loss are transport through the high field regions in the ppm and in the afp magnet .",
    "the transport though the ppm is about 25% .",
    "approximately half of the loss is due to polarization of the neutrons , and the other half is due to ucn absorption in the zr foil and non - specular scattering on the ucn guide walls in the high field region of the magnet which leads to enhanced wall losses .",
    "there is an approximate 15% loss in ucn density in the transition from the stainless steel to the copper guides because of the lower fermi potential of the copper .",
    "transmission through the afp magnet is about 60% , again due to non - specular scattering in the high field region .",
    "there is a 50% loss in density in loading the decay trap because the loading time ( which is determined by the aperture of the above - described 7-cm",
    "@xmath160 4-cm rectangular guide ) and decay trap lifetime are nearly the same .",
    "finally , there is an approximate factor of two loss in the transport from the biological shield exit to the decay trap due to guide losses .",
    "( the typical loss per bounce in the guide system is @xmath163 which is dominated by gaps in the guide couplings . )",
    "thus , all of these factors combined account for the reduction in the ucn density from its intial value of @xmath164 @xmath157 at the biological shield exist to @xmath165 @xmath157 in the spectrometer decay trap during runs in 20082009 .",
    "the decay trap consisted of a 300-cm long , 12.4-cm diameter electropolished cu tube situated along the warm bore axis of the 1.0-t solenoidal electron spectrometer .",
    "the vacuum pressure in the ucn guides downstream of the zr foil in the ppm and in the decay trap was typically @xmath166 torr .",
    "the ends of the decay trap were closed off with variable thickness mylar end - cap foils , whose inside surfaces were coated with 300 nm of be ( nominal 252 nev potential ) which served to increase the ucn storage time in the decay trap ( and , hence , the @xmath0-decay rate ) . an additional important feature of the end - cap foils is that they eliminated the possibility for neutron @xmath0-decay events in the region of the spectrometer where the field is expanded from 1.0-t to 0.6-t ( discussed later in section [ sec : experiment_electron_spectrometer_scs ] ) .",
    "collimators with inner radii of 5.84 cm mounted on the two ends of the decay trap suppressed events originating near the decay trap walls and also functioned as mounts for the end - cap foils . as discussed in more detail later , the thicknesses of the mylar end - cap foils were varied from 0.7 @xmath149 m to 13.2 @xmath149 m to study key systematics related to electron energy loss in , and backscattering from , these foils .",
    "the ucn density in the decay trap was monitored by a @xmath159he ucn detector coupled to a small ( 0.64-cm diameter ) hole in the bottom of the decay trap center , as indicated schematically in fig.[fig : ucna_schematic ] .",
    "a detailed description of the 7.0  t polarizing magnet and the afp spin - flip system is given elsewhere @xcite ; therefore , we provide only a brief description of this system here .",
    "the solenoidal superconducting magnet which serves as the primary ucn polarizer ( the afp magnet ) and provides the requisite environment for an adiabatic fast - passage ( afp ) spin flipper was designed by american magnetics using a cryostat supplied by ability engineering .",
    "it possesses a 194.9  cm long , 12.7  cm diameter warm bore and provides both a peak field of 7.0-t near the entrance as well as a 44.5-cm long precision gradient spin - flip region with an average field of 1.0 t , chosen to reduce neutron spectral differences between the flipped and unflipped spin states in the electron spectrometer decay trap volume .",
    "when energized to 96.45  a , the main coil of this magnet produces both the maximum polarizing field as well as the 1  t field , with an average gradient of @xmath167 t cm@xmath121 through the latter .",
    "ten superconducting shim coils centered on the uniform field region and spaced every 5.1  cm provide the ability to further tailor the uniform field in order to optimize performance of the spin flipper .    due to the high field in the spin flip region , the spin flipper was constructed using an efficient high - pass birdcage resonant cavity geometry @xcite . for the ucna experiment , this configuration was realized with eight cu tubes ( rungs ) arranged in a cylindrical geometry and connected at the top by 820  pf american technical ceramics chip capacitors and at the bottom by a sliding cu tuning ring whose position determined the inductance presented by the cu tubes . when excited by an r.f .",
    "signal such a geometry is resonant , with the fundamental mode corresponding to a discretized sinusoidal distribution of current in the rungs .",
    "this current distribution provides a transverse r.f .",
    "field , one rotating component of which is utilized for afp spin flipping , providing efficient spin reversal over a wide band of neutron speeds @xcite .",
    "the specific operation frequency was adjusted by moving the tuning ring , and the cavity formed after tuning the spin flipper to operate at @xmath169  mhz was @xmath170  cm long ( 8.74  cm diameter ) , coaxial with a 7  cm diameter dlc - coated quartz ucn guide .",
    "the ucna spin flipper was typically operated with 40  w of input power , which necessitated an impedance - matching system comprised of a calculated length of drive line and three jennings vacuum variable capacitors .",
    "water cooling was also required , and was accomplished by flowing chilled , filtered tap water serially through the rungs . in order to provide for stable electrical operation and to prevent r.f.radiation from inducing noise elsewhere in the experiment ,",
    "the birdcage cavity was driven in a balanced mode and electrically shielded by a grounded al cylindrical enclosure which also provided a vacuum seal around the dlc - coated quartz guide .",
    "the interior of this enclosure connected through four bellows to the outside of the afp magnet so that the actual r.f .",
    "cavity remained at atmosphere while the afp magnet bore and the guide system were under vacuum .",
    "this arrangement also provided feedthroughs for the r.f .",
    "drive line , water cooling lines , an rtd temperature sensor , and an r.f .  field sensor loop",
    ".    initial characterization of the spin flipper was performed in a crossed polarizer analyzer geometry as described in @xcite , which determined the average spin flip efficiency to be @xmath171 . during the actual running of the ucna experiment during the years 20082009 , tuning of the spin flipper , as well as run - to - run monitoring of its performance ,",
    "was accomplished using a @xmath159he ucn monitor located just downstream of the afp magnet , @xmath165  m below a @xmath172  cm hole in the bottom of the guide ( the location of this ucn monitor is indicated schematically in fig.[fig : ucna_schematic ] ) .",
    "this detector had a magnetized fe foil covering the detector acceptance which provided for spin state selection .",
    "the electron spectrometer system , consisting of a 1.0-t superconducting solenoidal magnet and a multiwire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) and plastic scintillator electron detector package , is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for completeness , we discuss the primary components of this system here .",
    "as described below , the electron spectrometer system was designed both to suppress the total electron backscattering fraction and to reconstruct low - energy - deposition backscattering events .",
    "the primary components of the two identical mwpc and plastic scintillator detector packages are shown in fig.[fig : mwpc_scintillator_schematic ] .",
    "the spectrometer magnet @xcite is a warm - bore 35-cm diameter , 4.5-m long superconducting solenoid ( hereafter , scs magnet ) .",
    "the coil , which was designed and fabricated by american magnetics , inc . , consists of a main coil winding with a single persistence heater switch , 28 shim coil windings ( each with individual persistence heater switches ) , and three rectangular 7-cm @xmath160 4-cm radial penetrations ( two providing horizontal access , and one providing vertical access , to the warm bore ) .",
    "these penetrations are located at the center of the coil .",
    "the magnet s 1600-l capacity liquid helium cryostat was designed and fabricated by meyer tool and manufacturing , inc .",
    "the magnet s full energized field strength of 1.0 t requires a current of 124  a in the main coil winding .",
    "note that the magnet s shim coils were not energized during the data - taking runs reported in this article .",
    "an important feature of the scs magnet design was that the field is expanded , as indicated schematically in fig.[fig : ucna_schematic ] , from 1.0 t in the decay trap region to 0.6 t at the location of the mwpc and plastic scintillator electron detectors , to suppress large - pitch - angle backscattering .",
    "in particular , the field - expansion ratio of 0.6 maps pitch angles of @xmath173 in the 1.0-t region to pitch angles of @xmath174 in the 0.6-t region",
    ". another important feature of the magnet design concerned the field uniformity in the decay trap region .",
    "electrons emitted with momentum @xmath175 , with @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) the initial transverse ( longitudinal ) momentum component , in some local field @xmath75 will be reflected from field regions @xmath69 if @xmath178 , thus contributing to a false asymmetry . by this same process",
    ", electrons emitted at large pitch angles in the vicinity of a local field minimum will be trapped .    the scs field profile measured during the data - taking period reported in this article",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scs_field_uniformity ] . as can seen there ,",
    "the field was uniform to the level of @xmath179 over the decay trap length , but included a @xmath180  t `` dip '' near the center of the decay trap .",
    "note that the field uniformity shown here was degraded from that originally published in @xcite ; this was the result of damage to the shim coil persistence heater switches during multiple magnet quenches .",
    "the impact of this field non - uniformity on the measured asymmetry is discussed later in this article .",
    "some of the most important features of the mwpc @xcite are as follows .",
    "first , because an mwpc is relatively insensitive to gamma rays , requiring a coincidence between the mwpc and the scintillator greatly suppressed gamma - ray backgrounds , a dominant background source in previous experiments ( see , e.g. , background spectrum in @xcite ) .",
    "second , the mwpc permitted reconstruction of an event s transverse @xmath181 position .",
    "this permitted the definition of a fiducial volume and the subsequent rejection of events occurring near the decay trap walls .",
    "such electrons can scatter from the decay trap walls , leading to a distortion in the energy spectrum and/or a bias to the asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath181 position information from the mwpc also permitted a characterization of the scintillator s position - dependent response , as the scintillator was viewed by four photomultiplier tubes ( discussed in the next section ) .",
    "the 64-wire anode plane was strung with 10-@xmath149 m diameter gold - plated tungsten wires , and the two cathode planes ( oriented at @xmath173 relative to each other ) were each strung with 64 50-@xmath149 m diameter gold - plated aluminum wires .",
    "the wire spacing on both the anode and cathode planes was 2.54 mm , yielding an active area of @xmath182 @xmath183 .",
    "this area in the 0.6-t field - expansion region mapped to a @xmath184 @xmath183 = @xmath185 @xmath183 square in the 1.0-t region , thereby providing full coverage of the 12.4-cm diameter decay trap volume .",
    "as demonstrated previously @xcite , the center of the event ( i.e. , the center of the charge cloud resulting from the electron s larmor spiral in the mwpc gas ) could be reconstructed with an accuracy of better than 2 mm , sufficient for the definition of a fiducial volume .",
    "third , to suppress `` missed backscattering events '' ( i.e. , those events depositing no energy above threshold in any detector element along the electron s trajectory prior to backscattering ) , the entrance window separating the mwpc fill gas from the spectrometer vacuum was designed to be as thin as possible .",
    "fourth , because of this thin entrance window requirement , the fill gas pressure was required to be as low as possible .",
    "the chosen fill gas , c@xmath186h@xmath187 ( 2,2-dimethylpropane , or `` neopentane '' ) , a low-@xmath188 heavy hydrocarbon , was shown to yield sufficient gain at a pressure of 100 torr and a bias voltage of 2700 v. at this pressure , the minimum window thickness ( over the mwpc s 15-cm diameter entrance and exit windows ) shown to withstand this 100 torr pressure differential with minimal leaks from pinholes was 6 @xmath149 m of aluminized mylar . note that the front window was further reinforced by kevlar fibers .",
    "the plastic scintillator detector was a 15-cm diameter , 3.5-mm thick disk of eljen technology ej-204 scintillator .",
    "this 15-cm diameter mapped to a 11.6-cm diameter disc in the 1.0-t decay trap region , providing nearly full coverage of the decay trap volume .",
    "the range of an endpoint energy electron in the plastic was 3.1 mm ; therefore , the 3.5-mm thickness was sufficient for a measurement of the full @xmath0-decay energy spectrum , while minimizing the ambient gamma ray background rate .    with the scintillator located in the 0.6-t field - expansion region at a distance of 2.2 m from the center of the scs magnet , light from the disc",
    "was transported over a distance of @xmath165 m along a series of uvt light guides to photomultiplier tubes which were mounted in a region where the magnetic field was @xmath189 t. the light guide system , shown schematically in fig.[fig : mwpc_scintillator_schematic ] , consisted of twelve rectangular strips ( 39-mm wide @xmath160 10-mm thick uvt ) coupled to the edge of the scintillator disc with optical grease .",
    "these twelve rectangular strips were then bent through @xmath173 over a 35-mm radius , transported over a distance of @xmath165 m away from the scintillator , and then adiabatically transformed into four @xmath190 mm@xmath191 rectangular clusters , with 5.08-cm diameter burle 8850 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) glued to each of these four rectangular clusters .",
    "therefore , each pmt effectively viewed one @xmath192 quadrant of the scintillator face .",
    "the magnetic shielding for each of the pmts consisted of an array of active and passive components , including ( moving from the outside to inside ) steel and medium - carbon - steel shields , a bucking solenoidal coil wound on the surface of a thin @xmath149-metal foil , and a @xmath149-metal cylinder .",
    "magnetic end caps were not required .",
    "the vacuum housing enclosing the scintillator , light guides , and pmts was maintained at @xmath193 torr of nitrogen , and was separated from the mwpc volume ( with its 100 torr of neopentane gas ) by the mwpc exit window .",
    "the nitrogen volume pressure was maintained at a somewhat lower pressure than the mwpc pressure to ensure that the mwpc exit window bowed out , or away , from the mwpc interior , to avoid contact with the mwpc wire planes .",
    "the scintillators were calibrated periodically with conversion electron sources , including commercially - available @xmath194cd ( 63 kev , 84 kev ) , @xmath195ce ( 127 kev , 160 kev ) , @xmath196sn ( 364 kev , 388 kev ) , @xmath197sr ( 499 kev ) , and @xmath198bi ( 481 kev , 975 kev , 1047 kev ) conversion - electron sources , and a custom - prepared @xmath199 in ( 162 kev , 186 kev , 189 kev , 190 kev ) conversion - electron source ( via implantation of @xmath196 in onto an al substrate and subsequent irradiation in a reactor @xcite ) .",
    "these calibrations were conducted _ in - situ _ using a vacuum load - lock source insertion system which permitted insertion and removal of calibration sources with the electron spectrometer under vacuum .",
    "the insertion point for these sources was through one of the superconducting solenoid magnet s horizontal rectangular penetrations at the center of the coil .",
    "note that this source insertion system permitted the sources to be positioned only along the horizontal axis of the decay trap s circular geometry ; however , as described later , the position dependence of the energy calibration over the full circular geometry was achieved by comparing the reconstructed neutron @xmath0-decay endpoint in a large number of binned positions over the scintillator face .",
    "the pmt gains were monitored on an approximate daily basis with a @xmath196sn source using this source insertion system .",
    "fits to the minimum - ionizing peak of cosmic - ray muons served as a run - to - run gain monitor .",
    "the electron spectrometer was surrounded with a cosmic - ray muon veto system which consisted of the following components .",
    "first , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwpc_scintillator_schematic ] , a 15-cm diameter , 25-mm thick plastic scintillator ( the `` backing veto '' ) was located immediately behind each of the spectrometer scintillators .",
    "second , a large - scale plastic scintillator and sealed drift tube veto counters @xcite surrounded the electron spectrometer magnet .      the frontend electronics for the experiment consisted of a vme - based system for the event trigger logic ( via discriminators and programmable logic units ( plus ) ) and for the readout of scalers , analog - to - digital convertors ( adcs ) and time - to - digital convertors ( tdcs ) . a nim - based system coupled to the vme system was employed for the implementation of a `` busy logic '' , which served to veto event triggers arriving during adc / tdc conversion times ( i.e. , during these modules busy states ) .",
    "this busy logic also prevented re - triggering by correlated scintillator afterpulses ( mostly occuring over a @xmath165 @xmath149s window @xcite ) , and was implemented with a lecroy 222 gate generator in latch mode .    a simplified schematic diagram of the trigger logic is shown in fig.[fig : trigger_logic_schematic ] .",
    "for each detector package , a trigger was defined by a two - fold pmt coincidence trigger above the discriminator threshold for each pmt ( nominally , set at 0.5 photoelectrons ) .",
    "the resulting two - fold pmt trigger rate in each scintillator was @xmath200  s@xmath121 ( primarily from low - energy background gamma rays ) ; the singles rates in each pmt as determined by counting in scalers were typically @xmath2011000  s@xmath121 ( from both dark noise and low - energy backgrounds ) .",
    "the main event trigger was then defined to be the ` or ` of the two detectors two - fold pmt triggers and other experiment triggers ( e.g. , from the @xmath159he ucn monitor detectors ) .",
    "the logic for the two - fold pmt coincidence triggers and the main event trigger was performed with caen v495 dual plus .",
    "those main event triggers not vetoed by the busy logic then triggered gate / delay generators for the readout of the adcs , tdcs , and scaler modules .",
    "the total number of two - fold pmt coincidence triggers were counted in scalers as a monitor of the daq dead time .",
    "caen v775 tdc modules were used for the relative measurement of the time - of - flight between the two detectors two - fold pmt coincidence triggers . this relative timing information provided for the identification of the detector with the earlier arriving trigger , important , as discussed later , for the assignment of the initial direction of incidence for electron backscattering events triggering both scintillators .",
    "these tdcs were also used to record the timing information from the plastic - scintillator - based muon veto detectors .",
    "a global event - by - event time stamp was defined by the counting of a 1 mhz clock in a caen v830 scaler .",
    "caen v792 charge - integrating adc ( qadc ) modules , triggered for readout by a @xmath202 ns gate from a caen v486 gate / delay generator , provided a measurement of the total charge measured in each pmt .",
    "the analog signals from the cosmic - ray muon backing vetos were also read out by these qadc modules .",
    "peak - sensing caen v785 adc ( padc ) modules , triggered for readout by a @xmath203 @xmath149s gate from a caen v462 gate generator , digitized the mwpc anode and cathode - plane signals . note that the anode signal that was read out was the summation ( i.e. , single channel per anode plane ) of the signals on all 64 of the wires comprising the anode plane .",
    "the 64 wires on each of the two cathode planes were read - out in groups of four ( i.e. , 16 channels per cathode plane ) ; hereafter , we will simply call each of these four - wire groups a `` wire '' .",
    "analog signals from the @xmath159he ucn monitors and the drift tube cosmic - ray muon veto counters were also read out with padcs .",
    "the data acquisition ( daq ) system was based on the ` midas ` package @xcite , with a dedicated linux - based workstation for implementation of the frontend electronics acquisition code and a separate dedicated linux - based workstation for run control and online analysis .",
    "the frontend acquisition code accessed the vme crate via a struck pci / vme interface .",
    "the ` midas ` raw data banks were subsequently decoded into ` cernlib ` ` paw ` @xcite and ` root ` @xcite file formats for data analysis .",
    "a separate data acquisition system , based on the ` pcdaq ` software package @xcite was used to monitor the proton beam charge incident upon the ucn source s tungsten spallation target and to asynchronously monitor environmental variables in the experimental area .",
    "the incident proton flux was measured using an integrating current toroid mounted around the proton beam line 8  m upstream of the tungsten target , just before the proton beam entered the biological shield .",
    "as noted earlier in section [ sec : experiment_source_guides ] , each proton beam pulse consisted of five 625 @xmath149s beam bursts separated by 0.05  s , with 5.2  s between each pulse s leading edge burst .",
    "the proton charge integrating system measured only the charge of the first of the five beam bursts in each pulse ; the resulting value was then scaled by five to yield the total proton charge delivered during each of the 0.2 hz beam pulses .",
    "the environmental monitoring system asynchronously read and stored up to 96 variables , on a typical time scale of 0.2 s to 1.0 s between readings .",
    "variables measured included cryogenic temperatures in the ucn source ( read by lakeshore 218 temperature monitors ) , pressures in the different segments of the ucn guide system ( read by capacitance manometer , thermocouple , and cold - cathode ion vacuum gauges ) , ambient temperature in the experimental area , and liquid helium levels and gas pressures throughout the cryogenic systems .",
    "the environmental data were time - stamped for later comparison to the @xmath0-decay data acquired with the main data acquisition system .",
    "in this section we provide a detailed description of our measurement procedures for @xmath0-decay and ambient background runs ; the various geometrical configurations of the experiment during our @xmath0-decay runs ; and our procedures for , and results from , measurements of the neutron polarization .",
    "the data taking during normal @xmath0-decay production running was organized into octets , each consisting of a- and b - type quartet run sequences .",
    "the structure of these quartet and octet run sequences , shown in table [ tab : octet_structure ] , was such that the neutron spin state ( hereafter designated @xmath205 or @xmath206 , with @xmath205(@xmath206 ) corresponding to the loading of ucn with afp - spin - flipper - on ( -off ) spin states into the electron spectrometer ) was toggled according to a @xmath207 spin - sequence ( for octets in which a - type runs preceded b - type runs ) or a @xmath208 ( i.e. , complement ) spin - sequence , with the order of @xmath0-decay and ambient background run pairs toggled for a particular spin state within each a - type or b - type run sequence . within each octet ,",

    "nearly all dead time effects cancel in the super - ratio technique . indeed , in order for there to be any bias to the asymmetry resulting from dead time effects in the background - subtracted @xmath0-decay rates , there must be a difference in the two detectors dead times , and there must be a difference in a particular detector s dead time for the two neutron spin states .",
    "thus , these effects are expected to be quite small .    nevertheless , as previously noted in section [ sec : experiment_electronics ] , the dead time of the daq system was monitored by counting , in scalers , the total number of detector two - fold pmt triggers , including those that were vetoed by the daq `` busy logic '' during the @xmath203 @xmath149s readout gates for the padc modules . however , to avoid spurious ( and correlated ) trigger chains from scintillator afterpulses ( as noted earlier in section [ sec : experiment_electronics ] ) distorting the determination of the dead time , the dead time was determined only from the scaler counts of detector triggers that occurred during triggers from the opposite - side detector or from other experimental triggers , such as the ucn monitors .",
    "the dead time , as extracted from the correlation between the daq trigger rate and the fraction of these `` missed triggers '' , was found to be @xmath227 @xmath149s , which is consistent with the nominal @xmath203 @xmath149s system dead time ( associated with the gate for the padc readout ) .",
    "further , the difference in the fraction of `` missed triggers '' for ( up to ) a 20 s@xmath121 trigger rate difference between the two spin states is no larger than @xmath189% . considered together , any possible bias to the asymmetry was no greater than 0.01% , which is the error we quote in table [ tab : systematic_corrections_uncertainties ] .",
    "alternatively , another possible way dead time effects could bias the asymmetry is in the background subtraction procedure , resulting from differences in the daq total trigger rates during @xmath0-decay and background runs .",
    "however , these effects tend to cancel in the super - ratio , as the four background - subtracted @xmath0-decay rates appearing in the super - ratio would be expected to be biased in the same direction .",
    "further , the effect is minimized as the signal - to - background ratio increases . under the conservative assumption of a 200 s@xmath121 daq trigger rate difference ( e.g. , from differences in the scintillator trigger rates , ucn",
    "monitor trigger rates , etc . ) for @xmath0-decay versus background runs , and a signal - to - background ratio greater than 5 , any such systematic bias to the asymmetry from dead time effects is @xmath228% .",
    "figure [ fig : energy_reconstruction_error_envelope ] showed the error envelope for the uncertainty in the visible energy calibration . to estimate the systematic error associated with possible errors in our energy calibration , we generated a large number ( 200 per geometry ) of random error curves that were constrained to fit within the limits of this error envelope .",
    "we then extracted from these error curves their contributions to an error in the asymmetry , resulting from an incorrect reconstruction of the electron energy , and hence @xmath229 . from these calculations we concluded that the maximum ( i.e. , worst case ) error , resulting from the case where the error curves for the two detectors are identical , is a fractional 0.47% uncertainty in the asymmetry for the analysis energy window of 275625 kev . as a conservative estimate of the systematic uncertainty associated with our energy calibration , we then assign this worst - case error of 0.47% to be the systematic uncertainty associated with possible errors in our energy calibration .    as discussed earlier in section [ sec : analysis_initial_energy_reconstruction ] , the default @xmath230 parametrization we employed was based on a fit to the scintillator visible energy @xmath231 only ; by constrast , an alternative @xmath230 fit included both @xmath231 and the calibrated mwpc energy @xmath232 . to study the sensitivity of the reconstructed asymmetry to these two different @xmath230 parametrizations , we extracted values for the energy - corrected asymmetry @xmath233 for these two different fits .",
    "the difference between these two methods , averaged over the entire data set , was 0.2% .",
    "this is small relative to the 0.47% systematic uncertainty associated with the energy calibration , and we also noted in section [ sec : analysis_initial_energy_reconstruction ] that this alternative @xmath230 parametrization based on both @xmath231 and @xmath232 is subject to ( uncorrectable ) overflow of the mwpc anode readout .",
    "another source of a systematic error resulting from the energy reconstruction as discussed in detail in section [ sec : asymmetry_endpoint_distributions ] ( and shown in fig.[fig : kurie_fit_distributions ] ) was the observed systematic @xmath23414 kev difference between the fitted endpoints and the monte carlo prediction .",
    "we investigated the systematic uncertainty to the extracted asymmetry due to this systematic difference by extracting a `` stretching factor '' , @xmath235 , where @xmath236 denotes the monte carlo predicted endpoint and @xmath237 the fitted endpoint , for each run .",
    "the data were then re - analyzed by applying on an event - by - event basis this `` stretching factor '' to the reconstructed energy @xmath230 , thus effectively forcing the fitted endpoints to match the monte carlo predicted endpoints .",
    "the asymmetries extracted from the `` streched '' data differed by @xmath238% from the ( original ) `` unstretched '' data which , again , is much less than the 0.47% error associated with the energy calibration .    finally , to account for a slight mismatch ( @xmath150 kev ) between the monte carlo and measured energy spectra ( this is visible in the final @xmath230 spectrum later in fig.[fig : final_spectra_asymmetries ] ) we fitted the monte carlo visible energy spectra to the measured visible energy spectra , and then extracted values for the asymmetry assuming these modified values for the visible energy .",
    "the bias to the asymmetry was @xmath239% averaged over all four geometries which , again , is much less than the 0.47% the energy calibration uncertainty .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : analysis_position_cuts ] , we required backscattering events to satisfy a default vertex cut of @xmath240 mm .",
    "we studied the impact of this cut on the asymmetry by varying this cut from 10 mm to 40 mm ; the effect on the asymmetry was @xmath241% , indicating a negligible systematic effect .    as was also discussed there , our fiducial cut required the position ( radius ) of the event on the primary triggering scintillator side to satisfy @xmath242 mm . to examine whether there was any position bias , we extracted the asymmetry in successive annuli via cuts on @xmath243 in six different annular bins , ranging from [ 0,400 ] mm@xmath191 to [ 2025,2500 ] mm@xmath191",
    "the asymmetries in all of these annuli were in statistical agreement , with no statistical evidence for any systematic difference with position .",
    "recall also in section [ sec : analysis_position_cuts ] we noted the possibility for the definition of four different coordinate systems . to determine whether there was any bias resulting from the choice of the coordinate system ( for example , a consideration could be whether there were any systematic variations in the backscattering fractions in the vicinity of the fiducial cut ) , we studied the variation of the asymmetry with the choice of coordinate system , and for fiducial volume radius cuts of 45 mm and 50 mm .",
    "the rms spread in the asymmetries for the different coordinate system choices was 0.24% for the 45 mm radius cut and 0.21% for the 50 mm radius cut .",
    "although the rms spread for the 50 mm radius cut was actually somewhat smaller ( suggesting that employing a larger fiducial volume would have introduced no bias to the asymmetry ) , we nevertheless chose the 45 mm radius cut as our ( conservative ) definition of the fiducial volume , and thus assigned a 0.24% systematic uncertainty to the definition of the fiducial volume .",
    "as noted in section [ sec : experiment_calibration_gain ] , the pmt gains were monitored on a run - to - run basis using the minimium - ionizing peak from cosmic - ray muon events .",
    "nevertheless , any residual uncompensated run - to - run gain fluctuations could bias the asymmetry on a run - to - run basis ; however , any such short - term run - to - run fluctuations will average away according to the usual @xmath244 statistics assuming the long - term gain corrections are accurate .",
    "we estimated the level of any such run - to - run residual gain errors by extracting the level of fluctuations in the run - to - run fitted values for the @xmath0-decay spectrum endpoint .",
    "these were typically of order @xmath245% in each detector , with the gain fluctuations in the two detectors only slightly correlated relative to each other .",
    "[ correlated gain fluctuations are significantly more problematic than are anti - correlated gain fluctuations . ] conservatively assuming the worst - case sensitivity for gain fluctuations in one of the geometries to be representative of the entire data set , we quote a systematic uncertainty of 0.20% for uncompensated gain fluctuations .",
    "the detector rates ( and , hence , asymmetries ) were ultimately calculated from the number of events passing the analysis cuts normalized to the detectors respective live times ; the concept of the detector live time was discussed in detail previously in section [ sec : analysis_data_quality_cuts ] . as discussed there , we defined a run s live time to be the fraction of that run surviving all of the global data quality cuts .",
    "however , as we noted there , it was necessary to apply a correction for the geometry b live times due to the large fraction ( up to @xmath246% ) of events suffering from an event - by - event tdc event counter problem .",
    "the correction factors for each run were determined using events identified as gamma rays , which were statistically independent of the neutron @xmath0-decay events and also provided higher statistics ( event rates up to 100 s@xmath121 in each detector ) than the neutron @xmath0-decay events themselves for the calculation of the correction factors .",
    "the resulting correction factors , defined to be the ratio of the number of gamma ray events surviving the event - by - event tdc event counter cut to the total number of gamma ray events , were then computed on a run - by - run basis for each detector .    only the geometry b live times were corrected according to this procedure . nevertheless , to assess the systematic error associated with our definition of and calculation of the live time , we extracted values for the asymmetries for all four geometries with and without application of these live time correction factors ( the correction factors for geometries a , c , and d were small , with the values for the asymmetries differing by @xmath247% under the two scenarios ) .",
    "averaged over all four geometries , the difference between the asymmetries extracted under these two different scenarios was 0.24% , which is the value for the systematic uncertainty associated with this effect we quote in table [ tab : systematic_corrections_uncertainties ] .",
    "our monte carlo calculations of the corrections for backscattering and the @xmath248 acceptance discussed in section [ sec : corrections_overview ] assumed a uniform magnetic field in the decay trap region .",
    "we studied the impact of the actual measured nonuniformity in the spectrometer magnetic field shown previously in fig .",
    "[ fig : scs_field_uniformity ] in monte carlo .",
    "qualitatively , the impact of the @xmath246 gauss `` field dip '' in the central decay - trap region is such that electrons from decays occuring in this `` field dip '' region are either reflected ( analogous to backscattering ) or are trapped ( for large pitch angles ) .",
    "we studied these effects in our ` geant4 ` monte carlo simulation program by implementing the magnetic field profile shown in fig.[fig : scs_field_uniformity ] directly in the simulation .",
    "neutron @xmath0-decay events were then generated uniformly along the length of the decay trap .",
    "in the monte carlo , @xmath249% of the events incident initially on one of the two detectors were reflected from the field dip , with an average @xmath250 of @xmath251 . because this small fraction of events carries little @xmath248 `` analyzing power '' , the resulting bias to the asymmetry is negligible .",
    "the fraction of electrons trapped by the field dip was @xmath252% , again with an average @xmath229 of @xmath251 .",
    "the remaining 97.1% of the events were not impacted by the field dip .",

    "we estimated the effect of a possible systematic uncertainty resulting from fluctuations in the muon - veto efficiency by extracting values for the asymmetries with and without application of the muon - veto detector cuts .",
    "averaged over geometries , the variations in the asymmetry were at the 0.3% level .",
    "we note that the assignment of this 0.3% uncertainty is quite conservative .",
    "a linear drift in the muon veto cut efficiency would be equivalent to a linear drift in the backgrounds , and as discussed in section [ sec : asymmetry_asymmetry_extraction ] , linear background drifts cancel under the octet - based super - ratio asymmetry structure .",
    "as already dicussed in detail , ambient backgrounds were measured and subtracted on a run - by - run basis . however , a possible source of irreducible backgrounds was neutron capture on materials near the electron detectors , generating prompt gamma rays with energies up to 7.9  mev , 7.1  mev , 6.8  mev , 4.9  mev , or 8.2  mev for capture on @xmath271cu , @xmath272cu , @xmath273be , @xmath274c , or @xmath275c , respectively , the elements of which the decay trap and end - cap foils were primarily composed .",
    "such backgrounds can not , of course , be subtracted .",
    "this background was expected to be significantly suppressed in the ucna experiment as compared to previous cold neutron beam experiments because , as discussed earlier in section [ sec : experiment_overview ] , the fraction of neutrons present in the apparatus which contribute to the decay rate is orders of magnitude larger in the ucna experiment than in previous cold neutron beam experiments , and also because of the small probability for capture and upscatter by ucn stored in the decay trap .",
    "we carried out three different approaches to our assessment of the contamination level from any such backgrounds .",
    "the idea of our first approach is as follows . if a gamma ray emitted from a neutron capture subsequently interacted with the scintillator , the mwpc should not have recorded any energy deposition if the gamma ray forward compton scattered in the scintillator .",
    "further , as calculated in simulations , there is a factor of 1020 suppression in the fraction of gamma ray events incident on the electron detectors triggering both the scintillator and mwpc as compared to those triggering only the scintillator .",
    "therefore , any such neutron - generated backgrounds should appear as non - zero residuals in a comparison of background - subtracted scintillator spectra [ i.e. , ( @xmath0-decay run @xmath206 background run ) spectra ] formed with and without application of a mwpc - scintillator coincidence cut . in particular",
    ", an excess would be expected in the background - subtracted spectrum constructed without the requirement of a mwpc - scintillator coincidence cut as compared to the background - subtracted spectrum obtained with the requirement of a mwpc - scintillator coincidence cut .",
    "now consider the following model .",
    "under application of a mwpc coincidence cut , let @xmath276 where @xmath277 denotes the resulting background - subtracted scintillator event rate , @xmath278 and @xmath279 denote , respectively , the underlying @xmath0-decay + background and background event rates , respectively , and @xmath280 denotes the mwpc cut efficiency .",
    "we then write a similar expression for the background - subtracted scintillator event rates obtained without application of a mwpc cut as @xmath281 where now @xmath282 and @xmath283 denote the signal and background rates during the @xmath0-decay and background runs from gamma ray events which would otherwise fail the mwpc cut . note that in the absence of any neutron - generated gamma rays , the statistical averages of @xmath282 and @xmath283 should be identical .",
    "the difference between @xmath284 and @xmath277 is then @xmath285 where @xmath286 and @xmath287 denote , for gamma ray and neutron @xmath0-decay events , respectively , the difference between the background - subtracted scintillator rates with and without application of a mwpc coincidence cut .",
    "thus , this model then requires an estimate for the mwpc cut efficiency .",
    "we extracted a value for our mwpc cut efficiency by examining the mwpc anode spectrum for @xmath196sn source calibration data . after placing a fwhm cut on the scintillator visible energy spectrum , we then fitted the resulting mwpc spectrum ( such as shown , for example , in fig.[fig : anode_cathode_spectra ] ) to a landau distribution , and its pedestal to a gaussian .",
    "we then calculated the fraction of the landau distribution falling below the cut line , which should provide an estimate of the mwpc cut efficiency .",
    "these values were found to be 99.93(3)% and 99.95(3)% for the east and west detector , respectively .",
    "we do note that this provides for an estimate of the mwpc efficiency only at the @xmath196sn energy .",
    "the residual @xmath288 ( no mwpc cut @xmath206 mwpc cut ) rates integrated over the analysis energy window ( and after all analysis cuts ) ranged from @xmath289 s@xmath121 to @xmath290 s@xmath121 for the two detectors and two spin states for all four geometries , representing @xmath291 of the @xmath0-decay rates . after accounting for the factor of 1020 supression for the fraction of events which would trigger both the scintillator and mwpc , the estimated contamination fractions for the actual @xmath0-decay analysis employing the mwpc - scintillator coincidence cut are then on the order of @xmath292 .",
    "propagation of the measured contamination fractions ( for each detector and spin state ) through the super ratio then led to a systematic bias to the asymmetry of order @xmath251% .    in our second approach",
    ", we extrapolated the residual background ( i.e. , after background subtraction ) above the @xmath0-decay endpoint into the signal region . above the endpoint ,",
    "the residual background - subtracted rates in the 25 kev @xmath230 bins were typically of order @xmath292 s@xmath121 or less . under the assumption that the neutron - generated background is independent of energy ( e.g. , as was employed in the analysis of @xcite )",
    ", we then extrapolated these above - the - endpoint rates into the analysis energy window .",
    "the resulting contamination fractions , @xmath293@xmath294 , were similar to the analysis in our first approach comparing background - subtracted scintillator spectra obtained with and without a mwpc cut .",
    "these contamination fractions were again propagated through our super - ratio asymmetry analysis , and the systematic bias was again found to be of order @xmath251% .    finally , in our third approach , we carried out a `` beta - blocker '' measurement in which a 6.35-mm thick piece of acrylic was placed between the decay trap and the mwpc in the field - expansion region of the spectrometer , as indicated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_blocker_schematic ] .",
    "the idea for this measurement was two - fold : ( 1 ) the acrylic was sufficiently thick to stop the endpoint @xmath0-decay electrons , thereby `` blocking '' the @xmath0-decay signal of interest ; and ( 2 ) the acrylic then served as a `` source '' of compton - scattered electrons , resulting from interactions of neutron - generated gamma rays with the acrylic .",
    "measurements were conducted with this piece of acrylic at two different positions , a and b , as shown in fig.[fig : beta_blocker_schematic ] , in front of one of the detectors .",
    "the motivation for doing so was that a comparison of the results from positions a and b should , in principle , permit a decomposition of the measured detector signal into contributions from compton - scattered electrons originating in this acrylic piece ( the solid angle for which was clearly smaller in position b as compared to position a ) , and direct neutron - generated gamma - ray interactions in the plastic scintillator detector ( which should not have varied with the position of the acrylic piece ) .    note that this measurement is subject to some model dependence , including an assumption for the source positions along the decay trap of the neutron - generated backgrounds ( which determines the ratio of the solid angles for positions a and b ) .",
    "our resulting estimates for the contamination fraction , as extracted from our measurements of the residual ( background - subtracted ) rates with the acrylic piece located at both positions a and b ( under the assumption that the ratio of the a and b solid angles for production of compton - scattered electrons was 20:1 ) , were of order @xmath294 .",
    "then accounting for the factor of 1020 suppression for gamma ray events triggering both the scintillator and mwpc ( in the actual geometry ) leads to an estimate for the contamination fraction on the order of @xmath292 , consistent with the other two approaches .",
    "the ucn polarization systematic was discussed earlier in section [ sec : measurements_polarization ] .",
    "because the measured depolarization was consistent with zero at the @xmath295 level ( i.e. , @xmath296 ) , we did not apply a correction for the polarization , and instead quote a one - sided systematic uncertainty in @xmath1 of @xmath297 resulting from the constraint @xmath298 .      a potential systematic effect",
    "would arise from any spin - state - correlated systematic gain shifts , such as from rate - dependent gain shifts .",
    "however , any such gain shifts shared by both detectors cancel to first order in the super ratio asymmetry and are thus expected to be small . as noted earlier in section [",
    "sec : experiment_source_guides ] , during the operation of the experiment , the total daq recorded data rates ( i.e. , the `` online '' @xmath0-decay rates integrated over all energies with few cuts ) during @xmath0-decay runs for the non - flipped spin state were typically @xmath299 s@xmath121 greater than those recorded during measurements of the flipped spin state . by taking data with calibration sources with different activities",
    ", we were able to bound any such rate - dependent gain shifts to then be @xmath300%/(@xmath299 s@xmath121 ) , which corresponds to a systematic uncertainty in the asymmetry of @xmath301% .",
    "our working assumption was that application of the @xmath304 and @xmath305 scale factors to the ` geant4 ` backscattering distributions calibrated our monte carlo calculations of our @xmath212 backscattering corrections to the asymmetry . to estimate the uncertainty in these now - calibrated corrections , we compared the ` geant4 ` results for the @xmath212 backscattering correction with the ` penelope ` results .",

[ fig : asymmetries_analysis_choice_geometries ] ) .",
    "we have taken a conservative approach to our estimate of the systematic uncertainty in our backscattering corrections , and quote a 30% relative uncertainty in the @xmath212 backscattering correction ( and , thus , in the asymmetry ) for all of the geometries .    to estimate the systematic uncertainty in the @xmath217 angle effect correction , we varied the thickness of the decay trap end - cap foil thicknesses in the monte carlo . assuming 0.5 @xmath149 m to be a reasonable uncertainty in the foil thickness , the relative uncertainty in @xmath217 was found to be no larger than 25%",
    "further , we note that the ` geant4 ` and ` penelope ` results for @xmath217 agreed to better than @xmath162% for all of the geometries .",

    "figure [ fig : delta2_delta3_error_bands ] shows the resulting energy - dependent error bands for the combined @xmath212 and @xmath217 corrections for each of the geometries .",
    "the analysis energy window of 275625 kev referenced earlier in section [ sec : corrections_analysis_energy_window ] was chosen such that the total error in @xmath1 resulting from integration of these error bands over some energy window combined with the statistical error within that energy window was a global minimum .",
    "as discussed earlier in section [ sec : analysis_mwpc_efficiency ] , the `` standard '' mwpc cut for the separation of gamma rays and charged particles was a cut on a fixed padc channel number .",
    "however , as shown there , the mwpc exhibited a strong position - dependent response .",
    "therefore , for some particular energy deposition in the mwpc , employing such a standard cut resulted in a position - dependent efficiency for the identification of an event as either a gamma ray or charged particle event .",
    "we investigated the impact of this position - dependent efficiency on the asymmetry by comparing results for the asymmetry extracted from analyses employing the standard padc channel number cut with those obtained with fixed mwpc energy cuts ranging from 0.10.7 kev .",
    "the error bounds from this analysis appear as the mwpc efficiency systematic uncertainties in table [ tab : systematic_corrections_uncertainties ] . note that this effect is largest for geometry d , for which the differences between the two mwpcs efficiency curves was greatest , as shown previously in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwpc_efficiency_energy_deposition ] .",
    "our final results are shown in fig.[fig : final_spectra_asymmetries ] , where we compare the background - subtracted @xmath0-decay @xmath230 spectrum , summed over both detectors , averaged over the two neutron spin states , and averaged over all four of the geometries , with the monte carlo predicted @xmath230 spectrum .",
    "there , we also show our geometry - averaged energy - binned values for the @xmath0-asymmetry @xmath1 , and the final statistical result of @xmath306 .",
    "note that the central value for @xmath1 was insensitive to the choice of analysis energy window , with the variation less than 15% of the statistical uncertainty for other windows between 150 and 750 kev .",

    "the statistical errors for each of these geometries were , of course , independent . however , three of our dominant systematic uncertainties ( energy reconstruction , backscattering , and angle effects ) were all correlated .",
    "for example , a mistake in the decay trap end - cap window thickness would have biased the angle effects correction for all of the data sets .",
    "therefore , we assume all three of these systematic uncertainties are 100% correlated across the four different geometries .    under this assumption , we then combined the results from the four geometries according to the following procedure which incorporates correlations properly in the construction of a global @xmath307 @xcite .",
