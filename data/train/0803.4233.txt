    "the purpose of this paper is to give a bijective proof of a fact that was discovered unexpectedly and connects two seemingly different branches of combinatorics .",
    "one of the branches is the study of matchings and set partitions and , more specifically , the statistics crossings and nestings .",
    "the other one is the study of directed paths in the plane .",
    "based on touchard s work  @xcite , riordan  @xcite derived a formula for the number of matchings with @xmath1 crossings . since then , a lot of results connected to this topic have been obtained .",
    "we mention a few .",
    "m.  de sainte - catherine in  @xcite bijectively shows that the number of matchings with @xmath1 crossings is equal to the number of matchings with @xmath1 nestings .",
    "this bijection also implies symmetric joint distribution of crossings and nestings .",
    "more than two decades later , kasraoui and zeng , in  @xcite , extended this bijection to show that the same result holds for set partitions .",
    "martin klazar  @xcite studied the distribution of these statistics on subtrees of the generating tree of matchings , and the same questions for set partitions were studied in  @xcite .    in another line of work , prellberg et al . in",
    "@xcite worked on founding a generating function of self - avoiding partially directed paths in the wedge @xmath3 consisting of east , north and south steps . using the kernel method they were able to derive explicitly the generating function for the case @xmath4 .",
    "the generating function revealed that the number of such paths which end at @xmath5 with @xmath1 north steps is the same as the number of matchings on @xmath2 $ ] with @xmath1 nestings .",
    "for a nice survey of the history of the problem and how this fact was discovered see  @xcite .",
    "a matching on the set @xmath2=\\{1,\\dots,2n\\}$ ] is a family of @xmath6 two - element disjoint subsets of @xmath2 $ ] . in particular , it is a set - partition with all the blocks of size two .",

    "we say that two edges @xmath9 and @xmath10 form a crossing if @xmath11 ( i.e. if the cross ) and they form a nesting if @xmath12 ( i.e. if one covers the other ) . if they are neither crossed nor nested we say they form an alignment .",

    "however , our bijection is different from rubey s , as illustrated in example [ t : phi ] . in particular",
    ", @xmath25 may be of special interest in the study of matchings because a key part of it is a bijection on matchings which , unlike the other bijections used in the literature , does not preserve the type of the matching , i.e. , the sets of minimal and maximal elements of the blocks .",
    "this may give further insight into the interaction between matchings of different type when various statistics of matchings are studied .",
