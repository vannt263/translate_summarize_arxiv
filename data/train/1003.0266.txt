    "optically carried microwave signals are of special interest in a large field of applications , from optical communication to opto - electronics techniques for detection such as lidar - radar  @xcite , and to fundamental metrology and spectroscopy .",
    "for instance , time and frequency dissemination at long distances by optical fibres has shown extremely high performances  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this principle is also widely used in atomic physics . as an example",
    ", it is at the basis of the coherent population trapping ( cpt ) clocks  @xcite , which benefits from the reduction of size compared to standard microwave clocks .",
    "this method is also used in most of the atom interferometers to generate raman lasers for manipulating atomic wave - packets  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it enables reduction of the propagation noise over the laser paths and systematic errors .",
    "the signal is composed of two optical frequencies separated by a frequency in the microwave range .",
    "this can be achieved by different means : directly from a two frequency laser  @xcite , by a single sideband electro - optic modulator  @xcite , by filtering two sidebands from an optical comb  @xcite or from a phase - lock between two independent lasers  @xcite , as used in this work . in most of the applications ,",
    "these sources are not powerful enough and would benefit from being amplified without adding extra sidebands or extra phase noise onto the microwave signal .    in this paper , we report a study of the influence of a semi - conductor tapered amplifier on a two frequency laser system .",
    "this setup is dedicated to the generation of a pair of raman lasers at @xmath0  =  852  nm , with a fixed frequency difference close to 9.192  ghz for further use in an atom interferometer  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup is described in section ii .",
    "sections iii and iv are dedicated to the characterization and measurement of the optical spectrum and to the analysis of the spurious sideband generation due to non - linear effects in the gain medium  @xcite .",
    "then we measure the extra noise added by the amplifier on the microwave signal in section v. finally , the impact on our atom interferometer is quantified in section vi .",
    "the laser setup consists of two external - cavity laser diodes using sdl  5422 chip .",
    "these sources are based on an intracavity wavelength selection by an interference - filter  @xcite and benefit from a narrow linewidth ( 14  khz ) and a wide tunability ( 44  ghz ) .",
    "the diodes are regulated around room temperature and supplied by a current of 80  ma to provide an optical output power of 45  mw .",
    "the frequency locks are achieved with a feedback to the diode current and the length of the external cavity .",
    "the first laser l1 ( fig .",
    "[ bancraman ] ) , is used as an absolute frequency reference .",
    "it is locked 300  mhz red detuned from the atomic transition between the @xmath1 and + @xmath2 states of caesium ( d2 line ) using a frequency modulation spectroscopy technique  @xcite .    the phase difference between l1 and l2",
    "is locked with the method described in  @xcite and summarized in the following .",
    "small amounts of light of l1 and l2 are superimposed on a fast photoconductor ( phd@xmath3 , hamamatsu g4176 , bandwidth : 15  ghz ) . the beat note at @xmath4  =  9.192  ghz is then mixed with a reference signal , given by a microwave synthesizer  @xcite .",
    "the output signal is sent to a digital phase and frequency detector ( dpfd , mch  12140 ) which derives an error signal proportional to the phase difference between the two lasers . after shaping and filtering ,",
    "this output signal is used to generate the feedback allowing to phase - lock the laser l2 on l1 . in this way",
    ", the features of the microwave reference is mapped on the optical signal with a bandwidth of 3.5  mhz .    in order to provide sufficient optical power ,",
    "the output signals of l1 and l2 are injected with the same linear polarization in a gaas tapered semiconductor waveguide amplifier ( ta , eyp - tpa 0850 - 01000 - 3006 cmt03 ) pumped by a current of @xmath5  =  2  a and stabilized to room temperature .",
    "a half - wave plate and a polarizing cube allow the power ratio between the two lasers to be adjusted at the input of the ta . in a normal operation ,",
    "11.2  mw of l1 and 16.2  mw of l2 are injected in the ta , which runs in a saturated gain regime .",
    "then the output beam ( with a power of 770  mw ) passes through an acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) , driven at 80  mhz , from which the first output order is coupled to a polarizing fibre .",
    "this scheme enables the laser light to be pulsed on the atomic system by switching the rf signal of the aom .",
    "in this part , we study the sideband generation due to simultaneous phase and amplitude modulation in the gain medium . as two closely detuned optical frequencies are injected in the ta",
    ", it is crucial to determine the spectral impact of potential non - linear effects in the semiconductor during the amplification process .",
    "indeed , the beat note at @xmath6 9.192  ghz between l1 and l2 induces a strong modulation of the power through the ta which affects the gain and the optical index in the semiconductor  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the resulting sidebands could cause undesirable effects on our experiment : for instance detuned excitations can shift the energy levels of our atomic system , called light shift  @xcite , or it could drive unwanted raman transitions . for this reason , we conducted simulations which were compared to experimental measurements .",
    "the total electric field propagating through the ta can be described by ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the wave envelope which varies at the microwave frequency , @xmath9 is the wave vector , and @xmath10 is the optical carrier frequency . by referring @xmath11 to the envelope power ( @xmath12 is its phase ) , we obtain at the ta input the modulation profile ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the nominal modulation power , @xmath15 is the modulation factor and @xmath16 is the phase difference between l1 and l2 ( see appendix [ equations_interactions ] ) . in our case , we have @xmath17  mw and @xmath18 .",
    "the amplifier is then driven between a saturated state and a non - saturated state at the frequency @xmath19 . in order to calculate the sideband generation expected from the amplification process , we write , as for any amplification medium , the interaction between the carriers and the light field equations .",
    "this was widely described in reference  @xcite for the case of a constant cross section amplifier .",
    "taking into account the amplifier splay ( see appendix  [ equations_interactions ] ) , these equations become ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the carrier lifetime in the semiconductor ,",
    "@xmath22 the saturation energy for the initial amplifier cross section , @xmath23 is the amplifier splay factor , @xmath24 the linewidth enhancement factor and @xmath25 is the wave group velocity .",
    "@xmath26 refers to the linear gain and the small - signal gain @xmath27 is defined as ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the current and carrier density required for transparency , @xmath31 the gain coefficient and @xmath32 the confinement factor ( see appendix  [ equations_interactions ] ) .",
    "the sideband generation is due to a phase and an amplitude modulation resulting from a non - linear gain modulation .",
    "this gain modulation depends on the field amplitude along the amplifier and lead to a non - linear distortion of the signal at the output of the ta .",
    "a modification of the optical index  ( [ equation_systeme_phi ] ) induces an optical phase modulation .",
    "indeed , an increase of the gain modulation exacerbates the phase and the power modulation distortions at the same time .",
    "the evaluation of this effect requires the set of equations ( [ equation_systeme_p]-[equation_gain_g ] ) to be solved .",
    "since the relaxation time @xmath33 and the excitation characteristic time @xmath34 are of the same order of magnitude , the usual adiabatic approximation ca nt be used .",
    "therefore , the system has been numerically solved to obtain the steady state electric field at the output of the ta for comparison with experimental measurements .",
    "due to the weak power expected in each sideband , usual methods to measure optical spectrum such as the transmission through a perot - fabry cavity or the diffraction on a high resolution grating are not suitable .",
    "instead , we use the beat note with a close known optical frequency in order to achieve the precise measurement of the different components of the laser beam .",
    "the output signal of a beat note contains a frequency component corresponding to the difference between the two mixed frequencies .",
    "it can be measured with a fast photodetector .",
    "the power of the beat note is then proportional to the product of the fields of the two components .    in order to realize a spectrum measurement",
    ", we set up a probe laser l4 .",
    "as shown on fig .",
    "[ lasersonde ] , the frequency of l4 can be adjusted around the cesium d2 line by the comparison to a reference laser l3 .",
    "this frequency lock is achieved by measuring the beat note of the two lasers , through a frequency to voltage converter ( fvc ) .",
    "a reference dc voltage ( vc4 ) allows the frequency detuning between l3 and l4 to be set around 8.6  ghz . as a result",
    ", l4 is detuned from l1 by @xmath35 = 8.3  ghz ( fig .  [ beatnote]a ) .",
    "the optical frequency spectrum of the phase - locked lasers ( l1+l2 ) can be analyzed by superimposing the probe beam l4 on the photoconductor phd@xmath3 , which exhibits the microwave components of the beat note between l1 , l2 and l4 . as explained before ,",
    "mixing three optical frequencies on a photodetector gives rise to three frequencies in the microwave domain . in this setup , l2 and l4 are sufficiently close that the beat note between these two lasers  ( 950  mhz ) is filtered out by the detection bandwidth .",
    "thus , we verify that before optical amplification , the microwave spectrum of the phd@xmath3 signal is composed of a component at @xmath19 of power @xmath36 and a component at frequency @xmath35 of power @xmath37 . in order to investigate impact of the amplification on the spectral content ,",
    "the same beat note is measured again at the output of the polarizing fibre and displayed on  fig .",
    "[ beatnote]b . compared to the expected microwave spectrum , containing the two previous frequencies ( @xmath19 and @xmath35 )",
    ", it exhibits an additional signal at @xmath38  =  10.142  ghz of power @xmath39 which is related to the beat note between l4 and an additional sideband detuned by 9.197  ghz from l2 .",
    "another symmetric sideband at 9.192  ghz above l1 leads to a beating signal with l4 out of the bandwidth of detection .",
    "small spurious sidebands around @xmath19 are generated by the acousto - optic modulator  ( aom ) at 80  mhz and can be ignored in the following .",
    "the ta characterization requires the determination of the set of parameters ( @xmath40 ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we perform three measurements , which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ measure ] .",
    "first , we measure @xmath36 as a function of the total optical input power  ( fig .",
    "[ measure]a ) .",
    "then we record the two magnitudes @xmath37 and @xmath39 as a function of the total input optical power  ( fig .",
    "[ measure]b ) and the current  ( fig .",
    "[ measure]c ) . from @xmath41 ,",
    "we deduce the ratio between the fields of l1 and the sideband .    using ( fig .",
    "[ measure]a ) and ( fig .  [ measure]b ) , we infer @xmath42  m@xmath43 , @xmath44  pj and @xmath45 , which are in agreement with the values indicated in reference  @xcite . from @xmath22 , we get @xmath46  @xmath47 .",
    "then , we use ( fig .",
    "[ measure]c ) to work out @xmath48  a and @xmath49  m@xmath50 .",
    "it gives the active volume @xmath51  m@xmath52 , in good agreement with the geometrical calculation @xmath53",
    "m@xmath52 .    in normal operation",
    ", the ratio ( @xmath41 ) of the micro - wave power is of -22  db , corresponding to an optical power ratio between the sideband and l1 of @xmath54 . as expected , increasing the current or the input power leads to an increase in sideband generation .",
    "finally , we work out from the simulation that the index modulation is responsible for 90 percent of the sideband generation and the amplitude modulation is responsible for the last 10 percent .",
    "the residual phase noise between the two lasers is crucial for the sensitivity of our experiment .",
    "indeed , the laser phase difference is imprinted on the atom wave - function during the stimulated raman transitions  @xcite .",
    "the effective phase noise affecting the interferometer is the sum of different contributions : the noise induced by the microwave frequency reference  @xcite , the residual noise in the phase - lock loop  @xcite and the noise added along the propagation through the ta and the fibre .",
    "the present study is focused on the characterization of these two last terms .",
    "the additional phase noise is measured by mixing the beat notes of the two lasers ( l1 and l2 ) before and after the propagation along the ta and the fibre .",
    "the two microwave signals are then amplified and combined together on a mixer  ( zmx-10 g ) .",
    "their relative phase @xmath55 is adjusted with a phase - shifter and set around @xmath56 to reach the optimal phase sensitivity at the mixer output . after filtering the high frequency components ,",
    "the output signal is given by ,    @xmath57    where @xmath58 represents the scaling factor ( 0.3  v / rad ) between the phase shift and the output level of the mixer .",
    "@xmath59 is the phase noise between the two beat notes .",
    "the measurement of the power spectral density of phase noise @xmath60 is obtained with a fft analyzer and displayed on fig .",
    "[ phasenoise ] .",
    "it exhibits the phase noise contribution induced by the ta and the fibre .",
    "the measurement is compared to the detection noise , which is obtained using the same signal in both inputs of the mixer .",
    "this detection noise represents the lower limit of the phase noise which can be detected by this setup .",
    "no significant additional phase noise from the ta and the fibre is measured above 1  hz .",
    "raman transitions enable the manipulation of atomic wave - packets by coupling two internal states of an atom using a two photon transition  @xcite . in order to drive these transitions , two lasers with a difference of frequency in the microwave range",
    "are needed .",
    "this laser setup is implemented to realize the functions of mirrors and beam splitters for atoms  @xcite in a six - axis inertial sensor  @xcite . a sequence of three optical pulses ( @xmath56 , @xmath61 , @xmath56 ) of duration @xmath62 , separated by free propagation time  @xmath63 is used to create the equivalent of a mach - zehnder interferometer  ( fig .  [ interferometer ] ) for atoms  @xcite . here",
    ", we estimate the possible limitations induced by the common amplification of the two raman lasers in our specific device which come from unwanted raman transitions due to the sideband generation or additional phase noise in the ta .",
    "first , the sideband generation in the ta is small enough to not give rise to significant raman transitions between laser l1 or l2 and one of the sidebands .",
    "the diffraction process is characterized by the effective rabi frequency  @xcite which scales as the product of the fields of the two lasers and the inverse of the raman detuning .",
    "the amplitude of the sideband is 22  db smaller and 9  ghz further detuned than the main optical fields .",
    "therefore the corresponding rabi frequency is reduced by almost four orders of magnitude .",
    "second , we estimate the additional phase shift from the ta .",
    "the phase shift at the output of the interferometer is deduced from the transition probability of the atoms between the two coupled states .",
    "it depends on the inertial forces and on the the phase noise between the two lasers  @xmath64  @xcite , as the phase difference between l1 and l2  ( @xmath65 ) is imprinted on the atomic wave function at the moment of each pulse ,    @xmath66    the transfer function of the spectral power density phase noise simplifies at low frequency ( @xmath67 ) as ,    @xmath68    where @xmath63 , the interaction time , is typically 40  ms . for high frequencies ,",
    "the transfer function decreases as a second order low pass filter with effective cutoff frequency ( @xmath69 ) . the total phase noise added by the ta and the fibre",
    "is given by the integration over the full spectral range of @xmath60 weighted by the transfer function .",
    "it leads to fluctuations on the output atomic phase noise of  0.21  mrad from shot to shot .",
    "this contribution is negligible compared to the noise generated by the present microwave synthesizer ( 2.51  mrad ) , or best frequency synthesizer based on current quartz oscillator ( @xmath70  1  mrad ) .",
    "to conclude , we demonstrate that amplifying optically carried microwave signal with a tapered amplifier induces neither microwave phase noise nor significant spurious optical sidebands",
    ". this setup does not give any additional limitation on the sensitivity of our device , which uses relevant parameters for cold atom interferometer .",
    "the sideband generation has been carefully characterized and shows a good agreement with the calculations .",
    "this effect becomes more significant as the microwave frequency get smaller .",
    "for instance , the model shows that similar results should be found for an interferometer based on rb atoms ( microwave frequency of 6.834  ghz ) , with an increase of the sideband generation as small as 2  db .    to a great extent",
    ", it shows that a powerful optically carried microwave signal can be realized in two stages : one performing the optical carried microwave signal and the other supplying the optical power .",
    "the quality of the amplification does not depend on a particular method to generate the optical signal and should be similar when sideband generation in an electro - optic modulator is used to generate the microwave signal .",
    "this can lead to simplifications of optical systems in atom interferometry  @xcite and of amplification for frequency and time dissemination at long distance .",
    "in addition , this method could simplify atom interferometer experiments in which several separated powerful raman beams are required  @xcite , as they can be amplified independently without special care .",
    "finally , this study has been realized in the steady state regime , and might be extended to the pulsed regime  @xcite which allows for higher laser power .",
    "we would like to thank g. lucas - leclin for fruitful discussions , e. foussier for her contribution to the experimental setup , j. d. pritchard and c. garrido alzar for careful readings .",
    "we also thank the institut francilien pour la recherche sur les atomes froids ( ifraf ) and the european union ( finaqs strep nest project contract no 012986 and euroquasar iqs project ) for financial support . t.l .",
    "thanks the dga for supporting his work .",
    "thanks ifraf for supporting his work .",
    "the theory of self phase modulation in semiconductor amplifiers has been developed for pulse propagation in reference  @xcite to the case where the pulse width @xmath71 is assumed to be much larger than the interband relaxation time @xmath72  ps which governs the dynamics of the induced polarization .",
    "our case concerns the beat note of two lasers , whose frequencies are separated by the beat frequency @xmath19 , and amplified through a tapered semiconductor @xmath73  mm long ( [ amplificateur ] ) . in reference",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the dynamic of a semi - conductor with a constant cross section is given by the set of equations ,                  these equations are inferred from a combination of the electromagnetic field propagation equation , on which the slowly varying envelope approximation has been applied , and the carrier density equation . in the latter ,",
    "the carrier density diffusion has been neglected in the @xmath85 direction ( the carrier diffusion length @xmath86m@xmath87 ) .",
    "however , it tends to make uniform the carrier density in the transverse directions ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the carrier density equation is therefore averaged over the directions @xmath89 and @xmath90 and appears through the factor ,        in the case of a ta , as the amplifier get larger , the carrier diffusion tends to make the carrier density uniform , which distorts the transverse mode .",
    "nevertheless , since the mode is kept guided , the factor @xmath32 remains of the order of 0.9 and is considered constant in the following .",
    "therefore , the set of equation [ [ equation_systeme_p2]-[equation_gain_g2 ] ] is still valid in the case of a tapered amplifier provided we change the last equation to ,        in order to solve the set of equations ( [ equation_systeme_p2],[equation_systeme_phi2],[g_evase ] ) , we consider the amplifier as a succession of equally @xmath95 long subdivisions of fixed transverse cross section . the combination of equation ( [ g_evase ] ) and equation ( [ equation_systeme_p2 ] )",
    "can be analytically integrated over @xmath85 along each subdivision and then numerically solved according to the shifted time @xmath96 .",
