    "one of the major problems in physics is to characterise the different correlations that arise between distant observers performing measurements on physical systems .",
    "the set of valid correlations depends strongly on the theory that one uses to describe such systems .",
    "indeed , such correlations allow one to distinguish in an operational way classical theory , quantum theory and more general probabilistic theories .",
    "for instance , since the work of bell @xcite , it has been known and widely studied that some correlations obtained from measurements on quantum systems can not be simulated by any local and classical theory ( local hidden - variable models ) .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as nonlocality .",
    "it can be seen in an extremely simple scenario consisting of two distant parties performing one out of two possible measurements in each round of the experiment .",
    "extensions to more than two parties have also been studied giving rise to the notion of multipartite nonlocality .",
    "remarkably , nonlocality has also been shown to be useful to perform quantum information tasks without a classical analogue , such as quantum key distribution @xcite and random number generation @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study a new form of correlations : those that arise between distant observers performing a sequence of measurements on their physical systems .",
    "naively , one may think that the sequence of measurements can be cast as an effective unique measurement and that the scenario is not essentially different from the standard one .",
    "however , we show that this scenario is in many ways richer than the one with single measurements per round .",
    "this is already implied by the results of @xcite where it was shown that some quantum states display only local correlations in scenarios with single projective measurements per round , but give rise to nonlocal correlations when a sequence of measurements is performed instead .",
    "this phenomenon was termed  hidden nonlocality \" .",
    "our main goal is to provide a general framework for the study of correlations that arise from a sequence of measurements on classical and quantum systems .",
    "already in the classical case , we show that different sets of correlations arise and hidden nonlocality is only the tip of the iceberg .",
    "first , we study classical hidden - variable models from the point of view of a resource theory .",
    "we establish a set of operations that one can perform on classical systems that do not create nonlocality between distant observers .",
    "this set of operations is determined by the causal structure established given by the sequence of measurements performed by the observers .",
    "relying on this operational framework , we are able to define a notion of  sequential nonlocality \" that contains as particular cases standard nonlocality and hidden nonlocality .",
    "we further investigate a type of hidden - variable models specially suited for scenarios with sequential measurements , in the spirit of time - ordered local models considered in @xcite .",
    "these different notions of classicality for the scenario with sequential measurements are also generalized to the quantum case .",
    "this analysis leaves numerous open problems that we enunciate and motivate for further study .",
    "in the study of correlation scenarios one typically assumes that for every physical system , prepared by a common source , each party chooses one measurement to perform and records the corresponding result before the source generates a new physical system for the next run of the correlation experiment .",
    "the data collected in this way allows the parties when they come together after sufficiently many runs to calculate the joint probabilities .",
    "this work studies a generalisation of this situation where the parties are allowed to perform a sequence of measurements on their part of the system in every run of the experiment .",
    "in general , these scenarios can be formulated for an arbitrary number of parties ; for simplicity , however , we will restrict our study to the case of two parties . as in a usual correlation scenario with a single measurement per party in each round ,",
    "a common source produces a bipartite physical system and sends one subsystem to @xmath0 and the other to @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to the standard situation , each party has now not only one set of possible measurement settings but one set of possible settings for each measurement of the sequence of measurements it is going to perform in each run of the experiment . to keep the notation simple let us start with the case of a sequence of two measurements for each party where we label the @xmath2-th measurement setting and the @xmath2-th outcome with @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( figure [ fig : scenario ] ) .",
    "then , the observed correlations are the collection of joint probabilities @xmath5    clearly , the outcome of the first measurement can not depend on later measurement choices ; but in the present scenario of sequential measurements later outcomes may well depend on the settings and outcomes of previous measurements .",
    "therefore , the correlations @xmath6 should not be viewed as four - partite nonsignalling correlations , but rather as a bipartite distribution , where no - signalling holds with respect to @xmath0 versus @xmath1 but where signalling from the first measurement of each party to the second of the same party is allowed .",
    "formally , the no - signalling condition between @xmath0 and @xmath1 means that a correlation @xmath7 that was obtained from a sequence of two measurements for each party obeys @xmath8 which guarantees that the marginal distributions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath9 are well defined .",
    "furthermore , as later measurements can not influence the outcome of previous ones , the correlations further have to fulfil @xmath10    correlations fulfilling the above conditions are the objects of interest in the study of sequential correlation scenarios .",
    "this notion can straightforwardly be generalised to the case of longer sequences of measurements .",
    "[ dfn : seqscenario2 ] for two parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 that perform a sequence of @xmath11 and @xmath12 measurements respectively , let @xmath13 , @xmath14 denote the @xmath15-th outcome and setting of @xmath0 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 the @xmath15-th outcome and setting of @xmath1 for @xmath19 .",
    "the correlations , given by the collection of the joint probabilities @xmath20 are said to be _ sequential with respect to @xmath21 _ , if @xmath22 is independent of @xmath23 for all @xmath24 and @xmath25 is independent of @xmath26 for all @xmath27",
    ".     notice that conditions and , when taking @xmath28 just express the no - signalling condition between parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "that is , the marginal statistics of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) do not depend on the inputs chosen by @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the remaining conditions obtained for @xmath29 in or @xmath30 in  capture the temporal ordering between the sequence of measurements chosen by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath31 in we arrive at the condition that @xmath32 is independent of @xmath33",
    ". this must be the case as the inputs @xmath33 should not influence neither @xmath1 nor the previous event @xmath34 in @xmath0 .    ignoring the length of the input and output alphabets for each measurement , a sequential correlation scenario is then characterised by @xmath35 specifying the length of the measurement sequence for each party .",
    "before we turn to the study of nonlocality in scenarios with sequential measurements let us review known notions of nonlocality , namely standard bell nonlocality @xcite and ` hidden nonlocality ' first considered by popescu @xcite .    the standard notion of locality is due to bell , who showed that correlations arising from local measurements on a bipartite quantum system can not always be explained by a local hidden - variable model @xcite .",
    "more precisely , consider the situation of two parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 performing local measurements on their share of a bipartite system .",
    "each system can just be seen as a black box that accepts a classical input , @xmath36 for @xmath0 and @xmath37 for @xmath1 , and produces a classical output , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the correlations between the input and output processes among the two parties are then described by the joint conditional probability distribution @xmath40 . the no - signalling principle for this case",
    "states that @xmath41    correlations are said to admit a local hidden - variable model if the probability distribution can be decomposed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a probability distribution of the hidden variable @xmath44 and @xmath45 are probability distributions of the outcomes @xmath46 given the inputs @xmath47 respectively .",
    "there exist different equivalent formulations of the set of assumptions leading to .",
    "for instance , the assumption of local - realism @xmath48 together with the so - called assumption of measurement independence stating that @xmath49 lead straightforwardly to .",
    "for sake of conciseness we incur in an abuse of terminology denoting correlations of the form simply as local .",
    "equivalently , correlations that can not be written as will be termed nonlocal .",
    "the set of all probability distributions that fulfil and define the convex polytope of local correlations @xcite .",
    "any no - signalling probability distribution that does not admit a local hidden - variable model violates at least one of the facet defining inequalities of the local polytope ; these inequalities are called bell inequalities and it is known that every pure entangled quantum state violates a bell inequality @xcite .",
    "while every pure entangled state violates some bell inequality , there are entangled mixed states that do not violate any bell inequality as shown by werner @xcite .",
    "he introduced a class of bipartite mixed states that , for a certain parameter region , are entangled but notwithstanding admit a local hidden - variable model for all possible projective measurements . these _ werner states _",
    "@xmath50 act on @xmath51 and are of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the identity matrix on the @xmath54 dimensional hilbert space , @xmath55 the flip operator , and @xmath56 . for @xmath57 these states",
    "are entangled but do not violate any standard bell inequality .",
    "werner proved this by constructing an explicit local hidden - variable model that reproduces the correlations of these states for arbitrary projective measurements @xcite .",
    "however , as noted by popescu in @xcite , a state like can give rise to correlations that are incompatible with an explanation by local hidden - variables if it is subjected to a sequence of measurements , thereby revealing what he named `` hidden '' nonlocality . to see how this argument works ,",
    "suppose that the system is subjected to a sequence of two projective measurements for each party .",
    "first , each party performs a measurement that corresponds to the projection of that party s subsystem onto a two - dimensional subspace ( or its orthogonal complement ) , i.e. @xmath0 performs the measurement given by the projections @xmath58 and @xmath1 the measurement given by the projections @xmath59 , where @xmath60 now , after recording the outcome of the first measurements the parties choose their measurement settings for the second round of measurements .",
    "when the parties obtained the outcomes corresponding to the projections @xmath7 and @xmath61 respectively in the first round , the post - measurement state is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 the singlet state .",
    "if the parties now choose observables @xmath64 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively that give the maximal value of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) expression @xcite for the singlet state , they obtain the following value @xmath65 that depends on the local dimension @xmath66 . for @xmath67",
    "we have @xmath68 , a violation of the chsh inequality , indicating that in this case the observed correlations can not be explained by a local hidden - variable model .",
    "so , even though a local hidden - variable model can account for all the correlations obtained from werner states with @xmath67 that result from a single round of local projective measurements , no such model could account for the correlations obtained when a sequence of two projective measurements is performed by each party .",
    "the example @xcite gave was concerned with a specific class of quantum states . clearly , those states display some sort of nonlocality but they have a standard local hidden - variable model .",
    "thus , the question naturally arises how to formulate the notion of locality in sequential correlation scenarios .",
    "another example of hidden nonlocality was reported in @xcite where examples of entangled states in dimension @xmath69 were presented that do not violate the chsh inequalities for rounds of single measurements but do so when sequences of generalised measurements , given by positive - operator valued measures ( povms ) , are performed .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , until recently , all known examples of hidden non - locality were derived for states that are local under projective measurements .",
    "therefore , it was open whether the non - locality of these states could simply be detected by allowing general measurements .",
    "in fact , while there exists a local model for general measurements acting on some entangled werner states @xcite , these states do not display hidden non - locality  la popescu .",
    "this question was solved in a recent work , where a class of entangled two - qubit states was presented that have a local model for general measurements ( povms ) for rounds of single measurements , but violate a bell inequality after local filtering operations @xcite .    for",
    "the sake of simplicity let us for now focus on the case considered by popescu , i.e. a sequence of two measurements for each party , where the first measurement by each party is always the same .",
    "we will denote by @xmath70 the measurement settings for the second measurement and by @xmath71 for @xmath72 the outcome of the @xmath2-th measurement of the parties @xmath73 .",
    "obviously , the notion of locality in the current scenario of sequential measurements should include the standard notion of locality in the sense of bell , that the probability distribution should be able to be decomposed as @xmath74 after the discussion of popescu s example it is also clear that another necessary condition for an appropriate definition of locality in sequential scenarios is the absence of hidden nonlocality .",
    "therefore , one will further require that all possible post - selections have a local model as well , i.e. @xmath75 for all values of @xmath76 and where the weights @xmath77 will in general depend on the outputs of the first measurement round .",
    "let us return to the explicit example by popescu .",
    "denote the first measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 by the projectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 ; and the second measurements by @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "then the probabilities read @xmath82    now , for popescu s example the projections of the first and second measurement commute for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the expression can be seen as correlations arising from a single projective measurement on each side and are therefore , due to the explicit hidden - variable model constructed by werner , local in the sense of . on the other hand , they do not fulfil the condition , for the probabilities post - selected on the first outcome of the first measurement , @xmath83 violate the chsh inequality .    as said ,",
    "the first condition is nothing but the standard locality condition in the spirit of bell between the two parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 when the pairs @xmath84 and @xmath85 are seen as one output for @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the remaining conditions through ensure that there is no hidden nonlocality as the correlations that arise from the subsequent measurement can be simulated by a local hidden - variable model whatever results were obtained in the first measurement round . as we will see in the following , these necessary requirements are in general not sufficient to capture the notion of locality in a sequential correlation scenario .",
    "popescu s example already showed that the standard notion of locality is not sufficient to capture the behaviour of correlations that can arise in a sequential correlation scenario .",
    "as said , the correlations obtained from rounds of single measurements are local as they admit a standard local hidden - variable model .",
    "one way to interpret the nonlocality revealed in popescu s example is to observe that the correlations do not fulfil condition . on the other hand ,",
    "the post - selection of the ensemble in is an operation that can be performed by the two parties locally and can thus be seen as a local preparation of a physical resource that is then subjected to a standard bell test .",
    "this way of looking at popescu s example gives rise to an operational definition of nonlocality . in the following",
    "we present a general framework for this operational characterisation of nonlocality adapted to sequential correlation scenarios .",
    "before we turn to the task of characterising nonlocality in operational terms , however , let us examine the lack of a decomposition as in for sequential correlations .",
    "this form of nonlocality of correlations can be understood as not admitting a local and causal hidden - variable model as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "[ dfn : sequentiallocal ] given sequential correlations with respect to @xmath35 , described by the joint probabilities @xmath86 the set @xmath87 of correlations admitting a _ time - ordered local model _ is given by correlations that can be decomposed as @xmath88 where the positive weights @xmath43 sum to unity and the conditional probabilities @xmath89 and @xmath90 are sequential , i.e. for all @xmath44 we have @xmath91 is independent of @xmath23 for all @xmath24 and @xmath92 is independent of @xmath26 for all @xmath27 .",
    "let us illustrate the definition of time - ordered local models for a simple example of @xmath93 . in this case",
    ", a time - ordered local model reads @xmath94 where we demand also that @xmath95 is independent of @xmath96 for all @xmath44 , and equivalently for @xmath97 .",
    "this should be interpreted as @xmath44 carrying information about the local instructions @xmath98 and @xmath97 , which fulfil the condition imposed by the sequential ordering of the measurements : the behaviour of @xmath99 does not depend on the posterior input @xmath96 , and equivalently for bob .",
    "let us compare these models with the standard formulation of local hidden - variable models by bell .",
    "the theorem of bell assumes a certain causal structure between the hidden variable @xmath44 and the events of measurements @xmath47 and outcomes @xmath46 of two separated parties to derive linear constraints , in the form of inequalities , on the joint probabilities @xmath40 .",
    "formally , a _ causal structure _ is a set of variables @xmath100 and a set of ordered pairs of distinct variables @xmath101 determining that @xmath36 is a direct cause of @xmath38 relative to @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "a convenient way to represent causal structures is through _ directed acyclic graphs _ ( dags ) , where every variable @xmath102 is a vertex and every ordered pair @xmath101 is represented by a directed edge from @xmath36 to @xmath38 .    in the standard bell scenario of two parties",
    "there are the observed variables @xmath103 and further the hidden variable @xmath44 , a common cause of both outputs @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , in this case one arrives at the causal structure presented in figure [ fig : causalstruct ] .    as for time - ordered local models let us for definiteness start with the simple case of two parties each performing a sequence of two measurements .",
    "the observed variables in this case are @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 denote the @xmath2-th measurement setting and @xmath2-th outcome for @xmath0 , and @xmath107 and @xmath108 denote the @xmath2-th measurement setting and @xmath2-th outcome for @xmath1 ; further a hidden variable @xmath44 that is a common cause for all outputs is assumed",
    ". clearly , there are direct causal influences from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , from @xmath107 to @xmath108 and from @xmath44 to all outputs .",
    "as we are treating the parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 as separated , we exclude causal influences from inputs of one party to the outputs of the other . later measurement outcomes of one party , however , will in general depend on earlier settings or outcomes of that party .",
    "the response of one party for its @xmath2-th measurement should depend only on the given hidden variable @xmath44 , the first @xmath2 measurement settings and the first @xmath109 measurement outcomes of that party .",
    "the resulting causal structure is shown in figure [ fig : seqstructure ] .",
    "note , any collection of conditional probabilities @xmath110 fulfilling the conditions of and defines via valid bipartite sequential correlations admitting a time - ordered local model for any distribution @xmath43 of the hidden variable . once we fix the causal structure , expressed in the conditions and , no fine - tuning of the model parameter @xmath43 is needed to obtain correlations with the correct causal independence conditions .",
    "the fact that the models defined on the causal structure shown in figure [ fig : seqstructure ] do not require fine - tuning makes them the natural generalisation of local hidden - variable models to sequential correlation scenarios . as already noted in @xcite",
    ", one can easily see that correlations admitting such a model do not display hidden nonlocality .",
    "[ prop : nohidden ] let @xmath7 be sequential correlations with respect to @xmath35 that admit a time - ordered local model .",
    "then all correlations obtained by post - selection admit a time - ordered local model .",
    "consider post - selection on the first measurement of @xmath0 to yield @xmath111 given the setting @xmath112 . given the time - ordered local model for @xmath7 @xmath113 the post - selected correlations are given by @xmath114 and can be written as @xmath115 where we defined @xmath116 and @xmath117 as the resulting correlations admit a time - ordered local model , further post - selections by either party will again result in correlations admitting such a model .    thus , one way to understand the nonlocality revealed by popescu s argument is to observe that the corresponding correlations do not admit a time - ordered local model as in definition [ dfn : sequentiallocality ] .      as said above , however , identifying post - selection as a possible operation that can be performed locally by the parties opens the possibility to characterise nonlocality operationally .",
    "so , instead of defining locality in a given correlation scenario through a specific class of models we set out to define nonlocality in operational terms ; this was done in @xcite for the case of multipartite nonlocality with single measurements in each round .",
    "the general idea within this approach is to interpret nonlocality as a resource , i.e a property of correlations that can not be created by a certain set of allowed operations .",
    "just as one can define entangled states as non - separable states , one can alternatively define entanglement as the resource that can not be created between two distant laboratories by the use of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an analogous operational framework for the resource of nonlocality was developed . in the following",
    "we briefly review the elements of this framework and adapt them to the current scenario of sequential measurements .",
    "the set of objects in the present scenario is the set of sequential correlations described by joint probabilities of the form @xmath118 that , as in definition [ dfn : seqscenario2 ] , can be obtained in a correlation experiment with sequences of measurements . to characterise nonlocality as a resource we need to specify the set of allowed operations in this scenario .",
    "a valid protocol for the two parties consists of two stages , the _ preparation stage _ and the _ measurement stage_.    the first stage takes place before the inputs for the final nonlocality test are provided and allows the parties to perform measurements on their share of the physical system and communicate the corresponding results among each other .",
    "depending on the obtained and communicated results the parties may choose to perform further measurements .",
    "note that classical communication is allowed at this stage ; as the parties have not yet received the inputs for the final bell test , however , this communication can not be used to create any nonlocal correlations .",
    "the second stage starts when the inputs for the final nonlocality experiment are provided ; from this point on no more communication is allowed .",

    "however , the situation described by popescu is special insofar as there is only one setting for the first measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as we show next , in a situation like this the existence of a time - ordered local model for the correlations",

    "if one defines the following linear combinations of correlators @xmath160\\\\ \\label{eq : newb1 } b ' & = \\frac{1}{2 } \\left[(1-b^1_1)b^2_{11 } + ( 1+b^1_1)b^2_{10}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can write one of the facet inequalities of @xmath87 as @xmath161 with this parametrization , this inequality resembles the chsh bipartite bell inequality .",
    "as it turns out , the inequality can be violated by probability distributions from @xmath147 : @xmath162 showing that @xmath163 .",
    "the correlations @xmath164 attaining the maximum in have by definition a standard local decomposition with respect to @xmath148 and do not display hidden nonlocality .",
    "however , the violation of by @xmath165 demonstrates that these correlations can not be explained by a time - ordered local model for sequential correlations .",
    "one may wonder whether such correlations that belong to @xmath147 but lie outside @xmath87 are physical , in the sense that they can be obtained with measurements on quantum states .",
    "we show that this is the case by constructing an explicit example .",
    "we consider a ghz state @xmath166 shared between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the first qubit is sent to @xmath0 while @xmath1 has access to the other two qubits . at each round of the experiment @xmath0",
    "measures one out of two possible observables @xmath167 with @xmath168 .",
    "part @xmath1 first measures one of his qubits according to the observables @xmath169 with @xmath170 .",
    "then , @xmath1 performs a measurement on its second qubit , using one out of eight possible observables @xmath171 that depend on @xmath172 , the outcome @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "for such a configuration , we have numerically found a maximal violation of @xmath175 . to achieve this it is sufficient to consider all measurements to lie in the x - z plane of the bloch - sphere , that is , @xmath176 with @xmath177 and @xmath178 being the usual pauli matrices . setting @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184",
    "we achieve the optimal value of @xmath175 while not violating the usual chsh inequality ( conditioned on any possible values of @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) .",
    "it is surprising that the observables for the first measurement performed by @xmath1 can be the same , its only role is to prepare the state @xmath185 with which the rest of the experiment is to be performed .",
    "now , as correlations from @xmath87 are known to be compatible with our operational definition of sequential locality , the violation raises the question whether there is a sequential wiring that takes @xmath165 to bipartite correlations @xmath123 that are nonlocal in the standard sense .",
    "in fact , we can prove an even stronger result .",
    "[ thm : easyscenario ] consider the bipartite sequential correlation scenario with respect to @xmath186 , where each measurement has binary inputs and outputs . then @xmath187 .    that time - ordered local models are compatible with the operational definition , i.e. @xmath188 , was shown in proposition [ thm : modelscomp ] . to see the converse ,",
    "consider @xmath7 to be compatible with the operational definition .",
    "we have that all post - selections have a local model @xmath189 for @xmath190 and @xmath142 .",
    "further , for all sequential wirings , specified by functions @xmath191 , the wired correlations @xmath192 are local as well .",
    "the conditions and are linear constraints on the probabilities of @xmath7 , so that we can define linear programs @xmath193 for all facet defining inequalities @xmath194 of @xmath87 . in the present case of just one measurement for @xmath0 and two for @xmath1 , these conditions are still tractable and we solved the linear programs using the software yalmip @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath195 for all facet defining inequalities @xmath194 of @xmath87 , which shows that the set of correlations compatible with the operational definition of sequential nonlocality is equal to @xmath87 .",
    "so , for this simple scenario , where @xmath0 performs a single measurement and @xmath1 a sequence of two with binary inputs and outputs for all of them , the time - ordered local models exactly capture the operational definition of locality .",
    "correlations admitting a time - ordered local model are not only compatible with the allowed sequential operations , but having such a model is equivalent to be sequentially local in the operational sense .",
    "this result together with the fact @xmath163 , shown above , implies that apart from popescu s hidden nonlocality there is a new form of nonlocality that can be revealed by studying correlations arising in scenarios of measurement sequences .",
    "formally stated we have the    [ thm : postbiggerop ] in the bipartite sequential scenario with respect to @xmath186 with binary inputs and outputs there exist correlations @xmath149 that are nonlocal in the operational sense , i.e. @xmath196 .    to clarify the interpretation of this result , let us consider an hypothetical scenario where a referee is given a device producing sequential correlations @xmath197 .",
    "the goal of the referee is to infer whether two parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 could use this device to violate a bell inequality , which would make the device potentially useful for quantum key distribution , randomness generation or any other information protocol based on nonlocality .",
    "the first naive attempt of the referee would be to check if the device , without any processing , is capable of violating a bell inequality between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . after concluding that this is not the case and , aware of the notion of hidden - nonlocality by popescu",
    ", he implements a protocol of postselection .",
    "that is , he discards the events in which the input and output of the first measurement of @xmath1 are different from a certain combination @xmath198 .",
    "after doing so , he checks whether this postselected statistics violate a bell inequality .",
    "he finds a negative answer for every combination of @xmath198 and concludes that there is nothing useful in this device as it is producing correlations that are classical in every sense .",
    "the implication of thm .",
    "[ thm : postbiggerop ] is simply that the referee may be mistaken in concluding so .",
    "there exist correlations that may seem useless for such referee s criteria , but that can be turned into nonlocal correlations by simply performing a local processing of information by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the question that naturally arises is : what should have the referee checked to avoid any wrong conclusion ? in this simple scenario of one dichotomic measurement for @xmath0 and two sequential dichotomic measurements for bob , due to thm .",
    "[ thm : easyscenario ] , we know that he should have checked whether @xmath7 had a time - ordered local model",
    ". if the correlations have such a model , then they are useless for such purposes .",
    "if the correlations do not have such a decomposition , then he can be sure that some protocol allows for a bell inequality violation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . whether this last implication holds in a general scenario is an open question that we enunciate , among others , in the next section .",
    "the previous section , in particular theorem [ thm : postbiggerop ] , shows that the study of nonlocality in sequential correlation scenarios does not reduce to the study of standard bell nonlocality ; on the contrary , inequivalent forms of nonlocality must be distinguished in these scenarios . however , a full characterisation of all forms of nonlocality is still elusive . in the following",
    "we will formulate and discuss several interesting questions that remain open .",
    "one of the most interesting open questions with respect to sequential nonlocality concerns the relationship between the set @xmath87 and the set of correlations that are sequentially local in the operational sense .",
    "we know that having a time - ordered local model implies being local in the operational sense , the converse , however , remains an open problem in the case of more general scenarios .",
    "[ prob : toloc ] in a general sequential correlation scenario , @xmath199 or @xmath200 ?",
    "suppose @xmath200 .",
    "then , for any sequential correlation scenario , the complicated set of operationally local correlations can be characterised by the facet inequalities corresponding to the set @xmath87 and all types of nonlocality for this scenario can be detected by these inequalities . if , however , @xmath199 , then , for some scenario , there are sequential correlations that remain local under all protocols involving wirings and post - selection while lacking a time - ordered local model .",
    "another relevant open problem is related to the nonlocality displayed by quantum states .",
    "does this new form of nonlocality open the possibility to detect more quantum states as nonlocal than would be possible with standard bell tests or using popescu s argument of hidden nonlocality ?",
    "due to the result of @xcite we know that there are quantum states with a local hidden - variable model for all projective measurements that display hidden nonlocality ; furthermore @xcite provides a class of entangled states that show hidden nonlocality while having a local model for general measurements ( povms ) . but are there quantum states that do not display hidden nonlocality in a given sequential scenario but nevertheless give rise to correlations that do not have a time - ordered local model ?",
    "this question was also raised in @xcite .",
    "if so , this would correspond to a new form of nonlocality exhibited by quantum states going beyond both standard and hidden nonlocality .",
    "[ prob : quantum ] is there a quantum state @xmath201 acting on a product hilbert space @xmath202 such that the following holds ?    * all correlations obtained from single projective measurements on @xmath201 are local . *",
    "all sequential correlations @xmath7 obtained by measurements on @xmath201 do not display hidden nonlocality .",
    "* for one choice of quantum measurements the sequential correlations @xmath7 do not admit a time - ordered local model .",
    "note that this problem is connected to the open question whether generalised measurements in form of povms offer an advantage over projective measurements for detecting standard nonlocality of quantum states and also to problem [ prob : toloc ] .",
    "assume @xmath200 and further that every quantum state @xmath201 that has a standard local model for projective measurements also has such a model for measurements given by povms .",
    "then the answer to problem [ prob : quantum ] is negative .",
    "we want to show that under the given assumptions the conditions ( i),(ii ) , and ( iii ) of problem [ prob : quantum ] can not be all satisfied .",
    "we assume ( ii ) and ( iii ) and show a contradiction with ( i ) . assuming @xmath200 implies that ( iii ) is equivalent to the existence of sequential correlations obtained from @xmath201 that are sequentially nonlocal in the operational sense . assuming ( ii ) excludes the possibility of hidden nonlocality , therefore only leaving the possibility that there are sequential wirings taking the correlations @xmath7 to some bipartite nonlocal correlations @xmath123 . applying these wirings on the sequential correlations obtained from projective measurements on @xmath201",
    "defines a quantum realisation of the nonlocal correlations @xmath123 with povms for both parties .",
    "now , the assumption that povms do not offer any advantage over projections implies a contradiction with ( i ) .",
    "popescu already mentioned that his argument using projective measurements to reveal hidden nonlocality does not apply to the case of local dimension @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the states found in @xcite in dimension @xmath69 do display hidden nonlocality when sequences of generalised measurements in form of povms are applied , however , these states do not have a standard local model for all measurements , but are only local in the sense that they do not violate the chsh inequality for rounds of single measurements .",
    "the authors of @xcite further presented states in dimension @xmath203 that fulfil conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) of [ prob : quantum ] , but they were not able to conclude whether ( iii ) holds .",
    "based on these findings and the conjecture that entanglement of a quantum state is equivalent to not having a time - ordered local model they also proposed a scheme for the classification of nonlocality . according to this scheme the nonlocality of a quantum state is characterised by two natural numbers @xmath204 , the _ indices of nonlocality . _ the first index @xmath205 denotes the length of the sequences of measurements necessary to reveal the nonlocality , i.e. the smallest number such that the quantum state gives rise to correlations that do not have a time - ordered local model with respect to @xmath206 .",
    "for instance , pure entangled states have @xmath207 and werner states in dimension @xmath67 have @xmath208 ; separable states have @xmath209 . if @xmath210 , then the second index @xmath129 denotes the smallest value of @xmath205 that can be attained by non - trivial measurements .",
    "for the case of werner states in dimension @xmath67 we have @xmath211 , as the post - measurement state has @xmath207 . for states with @xmath212 the second index",
    "is defined as the minimal number of copies of the state needed to reveal its nonlocality .",
    "so far , all the problems that we have tackled in this paper are concerned with locality , classicality and the different definitions and relations that emerge in a scenario with sequential measurements . but",
    "similar questions can be posed by substituting locality or classicality by quantumness .",
    "let us define analogous versions of @xmath87 and @xmath130 for the quantum case .",
    "sequential correlations @xmath7 belong to the set @xmath213 of time - ordered quantum correlations , if there are    * a quantum state @xmath201 on some product hilbert space @xmath202 * measurements on @xmath214 and @xmath215 given by the kraus operators @xmath216 and @xmath217 respectively * and projective measurements @xmath218 and @xmath219 on @xmath214 and @xmath215    such that the correlations @xmath7 can be expressed as @xmath220    just as before one can consider the correlations resulting from some protocol and ask whether there is a quantum realisation for this final bipartite distribution , i.e. whether @xmath221 for some quantum state @xmath201 and measurements @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "thus , analogous to definition [ dfn : sequentiallocality ] one can define the set of operationally quantum correlations .",
    "the set of _ operationally quantum correlations _",
    "@xmath224 is the set of sequential correlations @xmath7 such that for any @xmath129 the product correlations @xmath131 are mapped by any valid protocol to bipartite correlations that admit a quantum realisation .    by a reasoning similar to the one used in proposition [ thm : modelscomp ] it is clear that we have the inclusion @xmath225 . as a quantum version of open problem [ prob : toloc ]",
    "we can then pose the following    are there correlations that are operationally quantum but do not belong to the set of time - ordered quantum correlations ?",
    "that is , more formally , do we have @xmath226 or @xmath227 ?",
    "let us discuss the two possibilities separately .",
    "consider that @xmath228 . in this case",
    ", there are probability distributions that ( i ) do not have a decomposition of the form and ( ii ) result after any valid protocol in correlations with a quantum realisation of the form .",
    "clearly , ( i ) implies that one can not obtain these correlations by performing measurements on quantum states",
    ". however , all the correlations ( in the sense of a probability distribution between distant observers , without any temporal order between measurements ) that can be generated out of them , are quantum .",
    "this implies that if one attempts to characterise the observable statistics valid within quantum theory , it will not suffice to characterise the correlations between distant observers , but also scenarios with sequences of measurements need to be considered .",
    "this would suggest that attempts to define quantum correlations via information principles might leave a non - trivial part of quantum theory aside if they do not consider sequential measurements . on the other hand , if @xmath229 a converse reasoning applies",
    ". it would be striking that both sets are equivalent , since the constraints to define @xmath213 appear to be stronger that the ones of @xmath224 .",
    "note that the decomposition demands a well - defined post - measurement state , whereas the decomposition only requires the validity of the born rule .",
    "therefore , the equality of the two sets would support the idea that the whole set of observable statistics according to quantum theory only depends on the state space and measurements together with the born rule , rather than the transformations of states after measurements .",
    "to summarise , we have studied nonlocality in scenarios where the parties are allowed to perform sequences of measurements .",
    "as we have seen , sequential correlations give rise to inequivalent notions of nonlocality that we summarise in the following .",
    "1 .   @xmath147 : this is the set of probability distributions that are local in the standard bipartite sense studied by bell and that do not show any hidden nonlocality , i.e. the probability distributions after post - selection on the previous measurements are local .",
    "@xmath130 : this is the set of sequential correlations such that any valid protocol takes an arbitrary number of copies of these correlations to standard bipartite local correlations .",
    "these protocols process classical information locally and correspond to the allowed operations in a locality scenario , i.e. nonlocality is the resource that can not be created using these operations .",
    "@xmath87 this is the set of probability distributions that have a time - ordered local model , i.e. a local hidden - variable model that respects the causal structure of the sequential correlation scenario .",
    "we have studied the different relations between these sets and our findings can be summarised as    @xmath230    where we could show the equality @xmath231 in a simple scenario .",
    "we further stated and discussed several interesting open problems , among which the most important one concerns the question whether @xmath232 or @xmath233 in the general case .",
    "furthermore , we presented a quantum version of the different sets leading to analogous questions concerning the quantumness of correlations .",
