    "vacuum polarization and pair production have been issues of continuous concern since the early works by sauter , heisenberg and euler , and weisskopf @xcite , and then by schwinger @xcite ( for a review and references , see ref .",
    "the task of directly computing , without relying on the electromagnetic duality , the effective action in electric field backgrounds , however , has been a challenging problem due to the vacuum instability .",
    "dunne and hall used the resolvent method to directly find the effective action in time - dependent electric fields @xcite . in the previous paper @xcite , employing the evolution operator method , we found the exact one - loop effective actions of scalar and spinor qed at zero temperature in a constant or a pulsed electric field of sauter - type , which satisfy the exact relation @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 for scalar and @xmath2 for spinor ) between the imaginary part of the effective lagrangian density @xmath3 and the mean number of created pairs @xmath4 at state @xmath5 . even finding the pair production rate by time - dependent or spatially localized electric fields is methodologically nontrivial , which has recently been intensively studied @xcite .    to calculate the effective action and",
    "thereby schwinger pair production at finite temperature is another challenging problem in qed . in a constant pure magnetic field",
    "the qed effective action was studied at finite temperature @xcite and at finite temperature and density @xcite . however , the presence of an additional electric field raised schwinger pair production at debate depending on the formalism employed .",
    "some calculations in thermal field theory reported that the effective action in both a constant magnetic and electric field had an imaginary part having dependence on temperature @xcite .",
    "however , in the real - time formalism , no imaginary part was found in the qed effective action in the presence of both magnetic and electric field @xcite .",
    "the recent calculation of effective action in the imaginary - time formalism shows an imaginary part only at two - loop but not at one - loop in both a constant electric and magnetic field @xcite . in nonequilibrium quantum field theory of scalar qed , a calculation in the real - time formalism",
    "shows thermal enhancement of pair production @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", using the evolution operator method , we find the pair - production rate at finite temperature in time - dependent electric fields both in scalar and spinor qed .",
    "the evolution operator , unitarily transforming the particle and antiparticle operators from the ingoing vacuum to the outgoing vacuum , carries all the information of quantum evolution .",
    "in fact , the evolution operator is completely determined by the bogoliubov coefficients .",
    "the advantage of the evolution operator is the readiness to calculate the probability for transitions among multiparticle states .",
    "this allows us to compute the mean number of created pairs at finite temperature in scalar and spinor qed by counting the pairs from the vacuum and the induced production and the stimulated annihilation in a thermal ensemble of bosons and fermions .",
    "we find that the mean number of created pairs is factorized into the mean number of created pairs at zero temperature and the initial thermal distribution for bosons and fermions .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , rewriting the bogoliubov transformation as a unitary transformation by the evolution operator , we find the mean number of created pairs at zero temperature in scalar and spinor qed . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the mean number of created pairs at finite temperature and apply it to the sauter - type electric field .",
    "we first consider scalar qed for spinless charged bosons under an external electric field with the gauge field @xmath7 . the electric field is assumed to be acting on for a finite period of time so that the ingoing and the outgoing vacua are well - defined .",
    "thus , at @xmath8 , before the external electric field being turned on , the scalar field is free and the hamiltonian takes the usual form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the initial frequency at momentum @xmath11 . here",
    ", the gauge is chosen @xmath12 , so that the ingoing vacuum @xmath13 is the minkowski vacuum @xmath14 , annihilated by @xmath15 and @xmath16 for each momentum @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the outgoing vacuum at @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these operators are related through the bogoliubov transformations @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "to express the outgoing vacuum as multiparticle states of the ingoing vacuum , we rewrite the bogoliubov transformations ( [ sc - out - in ] ) as a unitary transformation @xcite @xmath22 here , the evolution operator @xmath23 is factorized into the overall phase factor and the two - mode squeeze operator as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25    from the charge neutrality of the vacuum , equal numbers of particles and antiparticles are produced at zero temperature and they carry the opposite momenta due to the momentum conservation .",
    "the multiparticle state of @xmath5-pairs can be concisely denoted as @xmath26 .",
    "the probability for @xmath5-pairs with momentum @xmath11 to be created from the vacuum is @xmath27 note that @xmath28 and @xmath29 for each @xmath11 .",
    "thus , at zero temperature , the mean number of pairs created from the vacuum for each momentum per unit volume is @xmath30    next , in spinor qed , before the interaction of an external electric field , the spinor field is free without the gauge potential @xmath31 , and has the hamiltonian given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are particle and antiparticle operators in the ingoing vacuum . after the interaction of the electric field",
    ", the ingoing vacuum evolves to the outgoing vacuum , whose particle and antiparticle operator are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the bogoliubov transformations between the ingoing and the outgoing particle and antiparticle operators , @xmath37 , are similarly given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the bogoliubov transformation can be also written as a unitary transformation @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 here , the three parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are determined by the bogoliubov coefficients as @xmath46 note that the pair production on spinor qed is restricted to only one pair of particle and antiparticle for a given quantum number @xmath5 due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "thus , the mean number of pairs created from the vacuum for each state @xmath5 at zero temperature is calculated as @xmath47",
    "we now calculate the mean number of pairs at finite temperature from the probability for each transition , as in the case of zero temperature .",
    "as there is no mode - mixing , we separately calculate the mean number of created pairs for each mode . for an initial thermal ensemble at @xmath49 , which might not be charge neutral , the mean number of produced pairs consists of the vacuum pair production , the induced pair production , and the stimulated pair annihilation as shown in fig . 1 : @xmath50 , \\label{mean - t1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the partition function for the initial ensemble and @xmath52 is the transition probability from @xmath53 to @xmath54 . using @xmath55 , which implies @xmath56 , the mean number of pairs created at finite temperature , eq .",

    "also the approximation scheme of the wkb or worldline instanton method has been developed @xcite . because the sauter - type electric field acts effectively for a finite period of time @xmath81 , the ingoing thermal states are stable and well defined as required in our formalism .",
    "2 shows the mean number of created pairs eqs.([sc - result],[sp - result ] ) at finite temperature with the electric field @xmath73 , the duration @xmath81 and temperature @xmath82 scaled in terms of the critical strength , the compton time and the electron mass , respectively .",
    "the production of scalar pairs is thermally enhanced , while the production of fermion pairs is thermally suppressed as expected by the pauli blocking , which is consistent with the calculation by density matrix method @xcite .",
    "the pure thermal effect on the mean number of created pairs , which is @xmath83 , is given by @xmath84 being the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "for @xmath85 , the distribution @xmath86 approximately equals to the boltzmann factor @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the mean number of created pairs at finite temperature , eqs.([sc - result],[sp - result ] ) , is reduced to the zero temperature result , eqs.([sc - mean],[sp - mean ] ) , for a temperature much lower than the rest mass",
    ".    our result eq.([sp - result ] ) could be compared with the calculation in imaginary - time formalism @xcite , where the thermal effect appears only at two - loop because thermal one - loop fluctuations are on - shell . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ sp - result ] ) , an off - shell calculation , is equivalent to the thermal loop times the vacuum one - loop , in fact , part of two - loops",
    ". one interesting comment to be pointed out is that the momentum integral over the distribution function in @xmath88 leads to the factor @xmath89 in ref .",
    "@xcite , though the momentum integral of the distribution is intertwined with the vacuum pair - production rate . to show rigorously the connection between our result and ref .",
    "@xcite requires calculating the effective action at finite temperature along the line of ref.@xcite , which will be addressed in the future .",
    "in this paper , using the evolution operator method , we found that the mean number of created pairs in state @xmath5 at finite temperature is given by @xmath90 for scalar and spinor qed in external electric fields , the total mean number density of created pairs at finite temperature is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the mean number of created pairs at zero temperature for scalar and spinor qed , respectively .",
