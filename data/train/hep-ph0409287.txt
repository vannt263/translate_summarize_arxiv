    "one of the most intriguing results of the heavy ion program at rhic is the fact that the nuclear modification factor in central @xmath2 collisions , @xmath4 \\big / \\big [ n(b ) { dn^{pp } \\over dyd^2p_t } \\big ] $ ] , is smaller than 1 for all @xmath1 .",
    "that means that the yield of particles produced in @xmath5 collisions at mid - rapidities and large @xmath1 increases with centrality much slower than the number of binary collisions @xmath6 .",
    "this phenomenon is particularly interesting since it is not observed in @xmath3 collisions at rhic at mid - rapidities .    in order to explain these data",
    ", one should take into account two kinds of effects .",
    "on one side , we have the effects that are important at low @xmath1 . in most of the models of multiparticle production , two contributions to the multiplicity are considered : one proportional to the number of participant nucleons , @xmath7 , and a second one proportional to the number of inelastic nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath8 , which is the dominant contribution at asymptotic energies . in order to get the right multiplicities at rhic",
    "it is necessary to lower this contribution .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed , like saturation in high density qcd through the colour glass condensate @xcite or clustering of strings @xcite in the string models .",
    "another possibility is the shadowing through pomeron interaction in the dual parton model @xcite .",
    "all these mechanisms have in common the modification of a multiple scattering pattern in the target rest frame or gluon interaction in a fast moving frame. at very high energies , the shadowing corrections which are non - linear lead , as @xmath9 , to a saturation of the distributions of partons in the colliding nuclei .",
    "these corrections are important for the description of inclusive spectra , for particles with @xmath10 . but with increasing @xmath1 the shadowing corrections decrease and the scaling with @xmath6 is predicted in perturbative qcd ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "so in order to explain the data at large @xmath1 , it is neccessary to consider that for particles with large momentum transfer , there are in general final state interactions jet quenching or jet absorption @xcite. these interactions lead to an energy loss of the large @xmath1 parton ( particle ) in the dense medium produced in the collision .",
    "hadrons loose a finite fraction of their longitudinal momentum due to multiple scattering . from this point of view , it is natural to expect that a particle or a parton scattered at some non zero angle will also loose a fraction of its transverse momentum due to final state interactions with a medium of partonic or prehadronic nature .",
    "the scattered particle does not disappear as a result of the interaction but its @xmath1 is shifted to smaller values .",
    "due to the steepness of the @xmath1 distribution , the effect of suppression at large @xmath1 may be quite large .",
    "moreover , in this case there is also a gain of the yield at small @xmath1 due to particles produced at larger @xmath1  which have experienced a @xmath1 shift due to the interaction with the medium .",
    "this suppression vanishes at low @xmath1 : when the @xmath1 of the particle is close to @xmath12 , its @xmath1 can either increase or decrease as a result of the interaction , i.e. in average the @xmath1 shift tends to zero .",
    "our aim here is to describe the suppression of the yield of pions in a framework based on final state interactions and taking into account shadowing and cronin effect .",
    "our approach contains dynamical , non linear shadowing .",
    "it is determined in terms of diffractive cross sections and it applies to soft and hard processes .",
    "the reduction of multiplicity from shadowing corrections can be expressed by r_ab(b)= d^2s f_a(s ) f_b(b - s ) t_ab(s ) ,  f_a(b)= t_a(b ) 1+a f(s ) t_a(b ) where the function @xmath13 represents the integral of the triple pomeron cross section over the single pomeron one : f(s ) = 4 _ y_min^y_max dy 1 ^p(s ) d^2 ^ppp dy dt|_t=0=",
    "c [ exp ( y_max ) - exp ( y_min ) ] . from this formula",
    "one can observe that for a particle produced at @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the effect of shadowing decreases at large @xmath1 due to the increase of @xmath17 in @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , due to coherence conditions , shadowing effects for partons take place at very small @xmath19 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the nucleon mass and @xmath22 is the radius of the nucleus . partons which produce a state with transverse mass @xmath17 and a given value of feynman @xmath23 , have @xmath24 .",
    "our shadowing applies to soft and hard processes .",
    "nevertheless , for large @xmath1 these effects are important only at very high energies , when @xmath25 satisfies the above condition . at fixed",
    "initial energy @xmath26 the condition for existence of shadowing will not be satisfied at large transverse momenta : in the central rapidity region ( @xmath27 ) at rhic and for @xmath1 of jets ( particles ) above 5(2 ) gev / c the condition for shadowing is not satisfied and these effects are absent .",
    "so for the large @xmath1 partons it is neccessary to include the final state interactions .",
    "the interaction of a large @xmath1 particle with the medium is described by the gain and loss differential equations which govern final state interactions : [ 1e ] d_h(x , p_t ) d^4x = - _ s where @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the space - time density of the medium and of large @xmath1 @xmath0 s , @xmath30 is the interaction cross - section averaged over momenta and @xmath31 represent the cylindrical space - time variables : longitudinal proper time @xmath32 , space - time rapidity @xmath33 , and transverse coordinate @xmath34 .    assuming a decrease of densities with proper time @xmath35 isoentropic longitudinal expansion",
    ", transverse expansion is neglected the above equation transforms into : [ 2e ]  d n_^0(b , s , y , p_t ) d = - n(b , s , y ) where @xmath36 @xmath37 is the density of the medium per unit rapidity and per unit of transverse area at fixed impact parameter , integrated over @xmath1 , and @xmath38 is the same quantity for @xmath0 s at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "if we integrate from initial time @xmath39 to freeze - out time @xmath40 and taking into account the inverse proportionality between proper time and densities , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the density produced in the primary collisions in dpm and @xmath43 is the density per unit rapidity for minimum bias @xmath44 collisions at @xmath45 gev= 2.24 @xmath46 , we obtain the suppression factor @xmath47 of the yield of @xmath0 s at given @xmath1 and at each impact parameter , due to its interaction with the dense medium .",
    "we get : [ 3e ] s_^0(b , y , p_t ) = d^2s  _ ab(b )  n(b , s )  _ ^0(b , s , y , p_t ) d^2s  _",
    "ab(b)n(b , s )  , where the survival probability is given by : [ 4e ] _ ^0(b , s , y , p_t ) = \\ { - n(b , s , y ) n ( n(b , s , y ) n_pp(y ) ) }  . here",
    "@xmath48\\}$ ] , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the profile functions and @xmath51",
    ".    one can estimate which amount of the effect takes place in the partonic phase and which one happens in the hadronic phase .",
    "we can divide our suppression factor in two parts : + partonic , from initial density @xmath52 to @xmath53 , or equivalently from @xmath54 fm to @xmath55 fm , and hadronic , from partonic density @xmath56 to @xmath57 @xmath46 , or equivalently from @xmath55 fm to @xmath58 fm .",
    "we find that @xmath59 of the effect takes place in the partonic phase while only @xmath60 of the effect takes place in the hadronic phase .",
    "in order to perform numerical calculations , we need @xmath30 our free parameter , @xmath61 mb and the @xmath1 distribution of the @xmath0 s . we have proceeded as follows : + in @xmath44 collisions at @xmath45  gev , the shape of the @xmath1 distribution of @xmath0 s can be described as @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64  gev / c .",
    "the corresponding average @xmath1 is @xmath65 = 0.349 gev / c . in @xmath2 collisions",
    "we assume that the @xmath1 distribution of @xmath0 s at each @xmath66 is given by the same shape , @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and changing the scale @xmath67 into @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the average value of @xmath1 measured experimentally at the corresponding centrality . for central @xmath2 collisions ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 is equal to @xmath73  gev / c resulting in a @xmath67 of @xmath74  gev / c .",
    "we take @xmath75 as fixed , since at large @xmath1 the shadowing vanishes and the ratio @xmath76 is independent of @xmath1 . also , the experimental value of @xmath75 in @xmath3 is the same as in @xmath44 within errors .",
    "we can thus compute the ratio @xmath76 in the absence of final state interaction ( colunm i , table 1 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath76 increases with @xmath1 , there is shadowing are low @xmath1 and we have a cronin effect that does not decrease at large @xmath1 .    to these values",
    "we apply the correction due to the suppression factor @xmath77 : first , we neglect the second term -the gain- in eqs .",
    "( 3 - 4 ) ( colunm ii , table 1 ) .",
    "we find a general suppression in @xmath76 , independent of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath76 increases slightly with @xmath1 and agrees with experimental data for @xmath78  gev / c . at lower @xmath1 the result",
    "is significantly lower than the data .    0.3 cm    0.5 cm    [ cols=\"^,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     -0.5 cm figure 1 . left : values of @xmath79 for the 10  % most central collisions ( lower line ) and for peripheral ( 80 - 92  % ) collisions ( upper line ) at mid - rapidities ( @xmath80 ) , using the @xmath1 shift as @xmath81 , ( solid line ) .",
    "the dashed line is obtained using @xmath81 for @xmath82  gev / c and @xmath1 constant for @xmath83  gev / c .",
    "right : values of @xmath84 for minimum bias collsions at mid - rapidities ( @xmath80 ) , using the @xmath1 shift as @xmath81 .",
    "the data are from phenix @xcite . 0.3",
    "cm we turn next to minimum - bias @xmath3 collisions at central rapidity . here",
    "gev / c . with the same value of @xmath75 as above @xmath86",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath87 . calculating the ratio @xmath3 to @xmath44",
    "we obtain the result of fig .",
    "1 . at forward rapidity",
    ", @xmath88 decreases as @xmath33 increases due two effects : + the first effect is basically due to energy - momentum conservation . it has been known for a long time in hadron - nucleus collisions at sps energies",
    "low @xmath1 `` triangle''. its extreme form occurs in the hadron fragmentation region , where the yield of secondaries in collisions off a heavy nucleus is smaller than the corresponding yield in hadron - proton .",
    "this phenomenon is known as nuclear attenuation .",
    "it turns out , that , at rhic energies , this effect produces a decrease of @xmath88 of about 30  % between @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "+ the second effect is the increase of the shadowing corrections in @xmath3 with increasing @xmath91 .",
    "this produces a decrease of @xmath92 between @xmath89 and @xmath90 of about 30  % for pions produced in minimum bias collisions .",
    "therefore , we expect a suppression factor of about 1.7 between @xmath92 at @xmath89 and at @xmath90 , practically independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the brahms results @xcite .    finally , there are some importants remarks to be done :    *   we use jet absorption , which is equivalent to jet quenching .",
    "it points to the existence of a dense system . *",
    "our final interaction takes place at very short times with a medium of partonic or prehadronic nature. this is not a rescattering of fully formed hadrons . *",
    "we have studied the different possibilities of @xmath93 .",
    "this is equivalent to a test on whether the mean energy loss @xmath1 being @xmath94 at @xmath14 is constant with energy which is the bdmps @xcite result for large enough energies. *   our results for @xmath95 gev / c depend little on the form of @xmath93 .",
    "the increase of the ratio with increasing @xmath1 for a constant @xmath93 coincides with jet quenching results when reasonable kinematical constraints are imposed @xcite .",
    "*   in perturbative qcd , @xmath76 should tend to unity at large @xmath1 .",
    "however , this may occur at much larger values of @xmath1 than the present ones . the bdmps energy loss result being energy independent applies for parton energies larger than those available at rhic .",
    "*   we use cronin effect in an effective way .",
    "our cronin does not die at large @xmath1 , and it does not increase with @xmath33 either . *   for the region",
    "in which @xmath19 is small enough , we use shadowing .",
    "it would lead to saturation at very small @xmath19 .",
    "so our shadowing provides a transition between saturation at very small @xmath19 and no shadowing at large @xmath96 ."
