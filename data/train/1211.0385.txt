    "over the past two decades , kohn - sham density functional theory ( ks - dft ) @xcite has been one of the most powerful theoretical methods for the ground - state properties of large electronic systems .",
    "its time - dependent extension , time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite has gradually become popular for the study of excited - state and time - dependent properties .    in ks - dft , the exact exchange - correlation ( xc ) density functional @xmath3 $ ] remains unknown and needs to be approximated .",
    "accurate density functional approximations to @xmath3 $ ] have been successively developed to extend the applicability of ks - dft to a wide variety of systems . despite the recent advances in the orbital - dependent density functional approach @xcite ,",
    "semilocal density functionals remain popular due to their computational efficiency for large systems and reasonable accuracy for applications governed by short - range xc effects @xcite .",
    "however , due to the associated several qualitative failures , semilocal functionals can produce erroneous results in situations where the accurate treatment of nonlocality of the xc hole is important @xcite .",
    "one of the important and long - standing subjects in ks - dft is the asymptotic behavior of the xc potential @xmath4/\\delta \\rho(\\textbf{r})$ ] . for finite systems ,",
    "the exact @xmath5 exhibits the coulombic @xmath0 decay as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , due to the severe self - interaction error ( sie ) @xcite , the xc potential of semilocal functionals fails to describe the correct asymptotic behavior , yielding qualitatively incorrect predictions for the properties sensitive to the asymptote , such as the vertical ionization potentials and high - lying ( rydberg ) excitation energies of atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "currently , perhaps the most successful density functional methods in practice to improve the asymptote of the xc potential are provided by the long - range corrected ( lc ) hybrid scheme @xcite and asymptotically corrected ( ac ) model potential scheme @xcite . for the lc hybrid scheme ,",
    "the nonlocal hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange for the long - range electron - electron interactions is added to a semilocal functional .",
    "therefore , the lc hybrid scheme can be impractical for very large systems due to the inclusion of the long - range hf exchange ( which significantly increases the computational cost relative to the semilocal functional ) .",
    "by contrast , for the ac model potential scheme , an ac xc potential is directly modeled and added to a semilocal functional , maintaining the similar cost as the semilocal functional . in principle , a model xc potential should be a functional derivative of some @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "however , as a number of popular model potentials are found _ not _ to be functional derivatives , several necessary conditions for a functional derivative can be violated @xcite .",
    "besides , as these model potentials are not variationally stable , the associated xc energies are not uniquely defined , and properties obtained from these model potentials need to be carefully interpreted @xcite .",
    "recently , we have examined the performance of the lc hybrid scheme and ac model potential scheme on a very wide range of applications @xcite . despite its computational efficiency",
    ", the popular model potential scheme can exhibit severe errors in the calculated ground - state energies and related properties , due to the lack of @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "on the other hand , for a system of @xmath7 electrons , the fermi - amaldi ( fa ) xc functional @xcite , @xmath8 = -\\frac{1}{2n } \\iint \\frac{\\rho(\\textbf{r})\\rho(\\textbf{r}')}{\\left|{\\bf r } - { \\bf r } ' \\right| } d\\textbf{r}d\\textbf{r}',\\ ] ] which is simply @xmath9 times the hartree energy functional , appears to be the simplest xc functional whose functional derivative has the correct @xmath0 asymptote .",
    "however , there are several problems with the fa model @xcite .",
    "while the fa xc potential is correct in the asymptotic region , it is inaccurate elsewhere .",
    "besides , due to its delocalized xc hole , the fa model is not size - consistent , where the energy of a system composed of two or more well - separated subsystems is _ not _ identical to the sum of the energies of the separate subsystems @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we propose an ac scheme for any system composed of atoms ( e.g. , atoms , molecules , and solids ) , wherein a modified fa xc functional , which is size - consistent in the calculated energy and whose functional derivative has the correct @xmath0 asymptote , can be directly added to any semilocal functional . without loss of accuracy ,",

    "as shown in table [ tab : property ] , the performance of the lfa - corrected pbe functionals is similar to that of pbe @xcite .",

    "in conclusion , we have developed the lfa scheme , wherein an exchange density functional whose functional derivative has the correct @xmath0 asymptote can be directly added to any semilocal density functional .",
    "in contrast to semilocal approximations , the lfa exchange kernel in reciprocal space exhibits the desirable singularity of the type @xmath1 , which is an important feature for the description of excitonic effects in non - metallic solids . applying the lfa scheme to pbe",
    ", the resulting lfa - pbe ( @xmath61 bohr@xmath62 ) has yielded accurate ips and rydberg excitation energies for a wide range of atoms and molecules , while performing similarly to pbe for various properties that are insensitive to the asymptote . without loss of accuracy , two closely related schemes ( rilfa and lfas )",
    "have been developed for the efficient treatment of large systems .",
    "relative to the popular model xc potential scheme , lfa - pbe is significantly superior for ground - state energies and related properties .",
    "it remains to be seen if the lfa - corrected pbe functionals will perform well for properties sensitive to the details of the xc potential ( not just to the asymptote ) , such as quantum defects @xcite .",
    "as with all pure density functional methods ( e.g. , semilocal functionals and model xc potentials ) , some limitations remain . due to the lack of hf exchange , the lfa - corrected pbe functionals may suffer from the sie problems , energy - gap problems , and charge - transfer problems ( e.g. , see the discussions in ref .",
    "nevertheless , the energy - gap problems may be circumvented by the perturbation approach recently developed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although the lc hybrid scheme , which has remedied several qualitative failures of pure density functional methods , could be reliably accurate for a very wide range of applications @xcite , it can be impractical for very large systems due to the expensive computational cost .",
    "by contrast , our lfas - pbe , which has the correct @xmath0 asymptote with essentially no added computational cost relative to pbe , is potentially very useful for the study of the ground - state energies and related properties , frontier orbital energies , valence and rydberg excitation energies , and time - dependent properties of very large systems .",

    "<S> aiming to remedy the incorrect asymptotic behavior of conventional semilocal exchange - correlation ( xc ) density functionals for finite systems , we propose an asymptotic correction scheme , wherein an exchange density functional whose functional derivative has the correct @xmath0 asymptote can be directly added to any semilocal density functional . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to semilocal approximations , our resulting exchange kernel in reciprocal space exhibits the desirable singularity of the type @xmath1 as @xmath2 , which is a necessary feature for describing the excitonic effects in non - metallic solids . by applying this scheme to a popular semilocal density functional , pbe [ j. p. perdew , k. burke , and m. ernzerhof , phys . </S>",
