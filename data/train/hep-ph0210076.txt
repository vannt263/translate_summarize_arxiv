    "lattice qcd provides non - perturbative techniques for the computation of the mellin moments of the structure functions of hadrons from first principles , without model assumptions .",
    "many results have been obtained in the past years from the lattice , and include the calculation of the lowest moments of various structure functions of the quarks : the unpolarized structure functions , the spin - dependent structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the transversity structure function @xmath2 .",
    "lattice perturbation theory is essential for the renormalization of the relevant operators .",
    "perturbative calculations of renormalization factors have been carried out for the lowest three moments of all structure functions , in the case of wilson and also of overlap fermions ( which do not break chiral symmetry ) . for many operators these renormalization factors",
    "are also known in the improved theory .",
    "perturbative renormalization factors have also been calculated for some higher - twist matrix elements ( 4-quark operators ) .",
    "it is not possible to compute a complete structure function directly on the lattice ( which is set up in euclidean space ) .",
    "the reason is that the structure functions describe the physics close to the light cone , and this region of minkowski space shrinks to a point when one goes to euclidean space , where monte carlo simulations are performed .",
    "however , on a euclidean lattice it is possible to compute the moments of the structure functions , using the operator product expansion : @xmath3 the wilson coefficients contain the short - distance physics , and can be perturbatively computed in the continuum .",
    "the matrix elements contain the long - distance physics , and can computed using numerical simulations , supplemented by a lattice renormalization of the relevant operators .",
    "operators of twist two ( twist : dimension minus spin ) dominate the expansion above .",
    "moments of the unpolarized structure functions ( which give the unpolarized distribution @xmath4 ) , of the spin - dependent structure functions @xmath0 ( which gives the helicity distribution @xmath5 ) and @xmath1 , and of the transversity structure function @xmath2 ( which gives the transversity distribution @xmath6 ) are measured by towers of hadronic matrix elements : @xmath7 } \\cdots d_{\\mu_n\\ } }   \\psi \\ ,    |   h   \\rangle \\\\ \\langle ( \\delta x)^n \\rangle & \\sim & \\langle   h   |   \\ , \\overline{\\psi }   \\gamma_5 \\sigma_{\\mu\\{\\mu_1 } d_{\\mu_2 }   \\cdots d_{\\mu_n\\ } }   \\psi \\ ,    |   h   \\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "to obtain physical continuum matrix elements from the lattice , the results of monte carlo simulations need to be renormalized from the lattice to a continuum scheme . to obtain these renormalization factors",
    "one has to compute 1-loop matrix elements on the lattice as well as in the continuum .",
    "the lattice operators at tree level , for @xmath8 , have the same matrix elements as the original continuum operators , so that at 1 loop @xmath9 where for the continuum one chooses the @xmath10 scheme , since the wilson coefficients are known in this scheme .",
    "in general @xmath11 , and the 1-loop renormalization factors on the lattice and in the continuum are different .",
    "the anomalous dimensions are equal , and thus for @xmath12 only a finite renormalization connects the two schemes .",
    "the matching between monte carlo numbers and the renormalized physical results is then @xmath13    since lorentz symmetry is broken on the lattice ( which is invariant under the hypercubic group ) , and for wilson fermions also chiral symmetry , the mixing of operators under renormalization is more complicated than in the continuum theory .",
    "operators multiplicatively renormalizable in the continuum may mix with other operators when they are put on the lattice .",
    "sometimes these mixing coefficients are even power divergent , that is they behave like @xmath14 . in general",
    "then the matching factors @xmath15 are not square matrices .",
    "most calculations are done using the discretization of the ( euclidean ) qcd action proposed by wilson .",
    "wilson fermions however break chiral symmetry , and this causes an additive mass renormalization even for a zero bare mass , and a heavy pion ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "extrapolations to the chiral limit are then needed , and this source of systematic errors has to be controlled .",
    "lattice perturbation theory is quite cumbersome : there are more vertices and more diagrams than in the continuum , the expressions contain a huge number of terms , and the integrals are more complicated .",
    "the wilson quark propagator is @xmath17 ^ 2 } , \\ ] ] which in the continuum limit gives @xmath18 and the gluon propagator ( in covariant gauge ) is @xmath19 .\\ ] ]    the lattice theory has exact gauge invariance at any finite @xmath20 .",
    "this causes the presence in the action of the group elements @xmath21 instead of the algebra elements @xmath22 .",
    "one has then to expand the @xmath23 s in terms of the @xmath24 s , and this generates an infinite number of vertices , of which only a finite number is needed at any given order in @xmath25 .",
    "the quark - quark - gluon vertex is @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 , the momenta of the quarks ) , which for @xmath28 gives @xmath29 , while the quark - quark - gluon - gluon vertex is @xmath30 this is an irrelevant vertex ( is zero in the continuum limit ) , but still gives non - vanishing contributions to feynman diagrams in divergent loops .",
    "also in the pure gauge part there is an infinite number of vertices .",
    "the 3-gluon vertex is @xmath31 which in the continuum limit becomes @xmath32 the 4-gluon vertex is too complicated to be reported here .",
    "furthermore , the gauge measure at order @xmath33 gives a @xmath34 mass counterterm .",
    "finally , using a faddeev - popov procedure one can obtain the feynman rules for the ghost propagator and the ghost interactions .",
    "the effective ghost - gauge field interaction is not linear in the gauge potential @xmath24 , and thus also in this sector new vertices appear that have no continuum analog , like the ghost - ghost - gluon - gluon vertex .",
    "a dirac operator @xmath35 which satisfies the ginsparg - wilson relation @xmath36 defines fermions with maintain an exact chiral symmetry also for non - zero lattice spacing and also keep all other fundamental properties .",
    "one of the possible solutions of the ginsparg - wilson relation is given by overlap fermions . in the massless case",
    "the overlap - dirac operator is @xmath37 , \\qquad x = d_w -\\frac{1}{a } \\rho , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the wilson - dirac operator . for @xmath39 one",
    "has the right spectrum of massless fermions .",
    "additive mass renormalization is then forbidden , and one avoids a source of systematic errors always present using wilson fermions .",
    "the massless quark propagator in the overlap is more complicated than in wilson , and is @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43    the overlap vertices can be expressed in terms of the vertices of the qed wilson action @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which are the vertices ( [ eq : qqg ] ) and ( [ eq : qqgg ] ) without the color matrices , and of the quantity @xmath46 .",
    "for example , the quark - quark - gluon vertex is @xmath47 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quark - quark - gluon - gluon vertex is very long and will not be given here ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "it is very expensive to decrease the errors due to the granularity of the lattice just by reducing the lattice spacing @xmath20 , because the cost would grow like @xmath48 in the quenched theory , and in full qcd it would grow even faster . halving the discretization errors in this way would then be at least @xmath49 times more expensive .",
    "a more effective way is to improve actions and operators .",
    "@xmath50 improvement removes the contributions of order @xmath20 to the systematic error arising from the finiteness of the lattice spacing by adding a counterterm to the fermion action , so that @xmath51 .\\ ] ] for wilson fermions , this is achieved in on - shell matrix elements adding a counterterm whose coefficient @xmath52 has to be exactly tuned . only for its appropriate value , for a given @xmath25 ,",
    "the @xmath50 effects are canceled and one gets a faster convergence to the continuum limit . due to",
    "this action counterterm one has to add to the wilson vertex ( [ eq : qqg ] ) the improved quark - quark - gluon interaction vertex  . ]",
    "@xmath53 where @xmath4 is the difference between the incoming and outgoing momenta of the quarks .",
    "in addition to this , one also has to improve the various operators , that is one must add a basis of higher dimensional ( irrelevant ) operators with the same quantum numbers , with @xmath54 : @xmath55    the @xmath50 improvement for overlap fermions is much simpler . the action is already improved , and thus there is no need of new interactions .",
    "the improved operators are given , to all orders , by @xmath56 ( while for wilson fermions the improvement construction is different for each operator ) .",
    "one thus gets full @xmath50 improvement without tuning any coefficients , and to all orders of perturbation theory . for wilson fermions , instead",
    ", one has to determine the coefficients of the operator counterterms order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "due to the complexity of the calculations , to the possible great number of diagrams , and above all to the huge amount of terms in each diagram , computer codes have to be used . to evaluate the feynman diagrams and obtain the algebraic expressions for the renormalization factors , we have thus developed sets of computer codes written in the symbolic manipulation language form .",
    "these codes take as input the feynman rules for the particular combination of operators , propagators ( wilson or overlap ) and vertices ( wilson , improved , or overlap ) appearing in each diagram , expand them in the lattice spacing @xmath20 at the appropriate order , evaluate the gamma algebra on the lattice , and then work out everything until the final expressions are obtained .",
    "the main difficulty in developing such codes is that the ( euclidean ) lorentz group @xmath57 breaks down to the hypercubic group @xmath58 . a representation which is irreducible under the ( euclidean ) lorentz",
    "group is thus in general reducible under the symmetry group of the lattice .",
    "this gives rise to a whole new class of problems , of which the most serious concerns the einstein summation convention .",
    "the form language has been developed having in mind the usual continuum calculations .",
    "there are therefore many useful built - in features which are sometimes somewhat of an hindrance when one tries to perform lattice perturbative calculations .",
    "a blind use of them would give , for example , @xmath59 one thus needs to develop special routines to cope with the gamma algebra on the lattice .",
    "integrals are done over the first brillouin zone @xmath60 with the rescaling @xmath61 , and in general an expansion in @xmath62 is needed .",
    "form codes become then necessary also because of the huge number of terms arising from the taylor expansions of the fourier transforms of operators , propagators , vertices and covariant derivatives .",
    "the @xmath63-th moment of a parton distribution behaves like @xmath64 because @xmath65 , and thus one has to perform an expansion in @xmath20 to order @xmath63 for every quantity .",
    "for example , the wilson quark propagator to @xmath50 is @xmath66 \\bigg\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the denominator is @xmath67 as a consequence , a huge number of terms appear ( at least in the initial stages of the manipulations ) , and also the gamma algebra becomes quite cumbersome to do by hand .",
    "all this also implies a limitation on the number of moments of structure functions that one can compute .",
    "we have calculated the renormalization in the @xmath10 scheme of several operators measuring the lowest moments of structure functions  @xcite . in some cases for a given moment",
    "we have computed two operators , labeled @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which belong to two different representations of the discrete euclidean lorentz group ( see table  [ fig : renorm ] ) .",
    "all lorentz indices are distinct . ]",
    "operator mixing for overlap fermions is simpler than for wilson fermions : chiral symmetry is not broken and thus it prohibits any mixing with operators of different chirality . mixing coefficients which are power - divergent like @xmath70 in the continuum limit",
    "can be eliminated from the start from overlap calculations if the corresponding operators belong to multiplets with the wrong chirality . in the wilson case , indeed , the operators measuring the moments of the @xmath1 structure function present additional mixings with wrong - chirality operators with power - divergent coefficients .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath71 s of the @xmath63-th moments of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are not constrained to be equal anymore .",
    ".renormalization constants of multiplicatively renormalized structure function operators , for @xmath72 , in the @xmath10 scheme .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > \" , ]     for reasons of computing power , structure functions have been studied mostly in the quenched approximation , and only recently computations in full qcd have become feasible . on the lattice",
    "the grassmann variables have to be analytically integrated , and the partition function @xmath73 - \\overline{\\psi } ( \\not{\\hspace{-0.02cm}d}[u]+m_f ) \\psi}\\ ] ] becomes in the simulations @xmath74+m_f )     { \\rm e}^{-s_g[u ] } , \\ ] ] which is equivalent to use an effective action @xmath75 = s_g[u ] - \\ln   \\det ( \\not{\\hspace{-0.12cm}d}[u]+m_f ) .\\ ] ] quenching amounts to doing simulations with @xmath76+m_f ) = 1 $ ] .",
    "this means that there are no sea quarks : all internal quark loops are neglected .",
    "although it looks quite drastic , it is not a bad approximation for many physical quantities , and apparently ( as it has been understood recently ) also for structure functions .",
    "structure functions in full wilson qcd have been the major progress in the past couple of years  @xcite .",
    "the first studies with dynamical wilson quarks have shown no statistically significant differences between quenched and full qcd results .",
    "previously it had been conjectured that quenching was the cause of the observed discrepancies of lattice results with experiment .",
    "evidently this is not the case , at least for the values of wilson quark masses attainable at present .",
    "the largest discrepancies appear for unpolarized quark distributions .",
    "the spin - dependent @xmath0 and @xmath1 structure functions have also been extensively studied , as well as the axial charge @xmath77 ( which deviates less from experiment ) and the @xmath2 transversity structure function  @xcite , whose lowest moment is the tensor charge @xmath78 .",
    "one limitation of present simulations is given by the difficulty to compute numerically diagrams which are disconnected ( except through gluon lines ) .",
    "the disconnected diagrams are however flavor independent , and do not contribute to the difference between @xmath79 and @xmath80 structure functions ( for @xmath81 degeneracy ) .",
    "this means that quantities like @xmath82 and @xmath83 do not receive contributions from disconnected diagrams .",
    "their lattice results seem also to be closer to the experimental numbers .",
    "the chiral extrapolations of the lattice data linear in @xmath84 could also be responsible for the discrepancies with experiment .",
    "it has been recently suggested that extrapolations using chiral perturbation theory could solve these discrepancies ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , the pion cloud of the nucleon is not adequately described by current lattices .",
    "extrapolation formulae which use chiral perturbation theory look like @xmath85 } \\\\ & & + b_n   ( m_\\pi r_0)^2 + c_n   ( a / r_0)^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is a phenomenological cutoff related to the size of the source generating the pion cloud .",
    "these extrapolation formulae seem able to resolve the discrepancy with experiment .",
    "however , results can be reproduced only with @xmath86 s with a range so wide to have no predictive power , and the currently available lattice data do not even discriminate between linear and chiral perturbation theory fits .",
    "the problems is that the available pions are not sufficiently light . a smaller pion mass ( @xmath87 ) is needed before the parameters of the chiral expansions can be well determined on the lattice .",
    "such calculations require about 8 teraflops for one year .",
    "the next generation of computers , coming in a couple of years , will be able to perform these calculations .",
    "there is no doubt that the pion cloud of the proton is very important . for it to be adequately included in the lattice box and",
    "properly measured in monte carlo simulations , the pion correlation length should be much smaller than the lattice size .",
    "this points to the use of larger lattices .",
    "higher - twist corrections have also been studied  @xcite .",
    "the lattice results for the twist four ( @xmath88 ) corrections are ( in a few particular cases ) quite small .",
    "the renormalization factors of four - quark operators like @xmath89 have been calculated in perturbation theory , and the twist-4 results for the first moment of the unpolarized pion and proton structure functions turn out to be much smaller than the corresponding twist-2 matrix elements computed on the lattice , and also smaller than the phenomenological numbers .",
    "these are not however complete and systematic studies , like the ones concerning leading - twist operators .",
    "only particular flavor and isospin combinations could be considered , to avoid mixing with lower - dimensional operators .",
    "the lattice provides invaluable techniques for investigating moments of structure functions non - perturbatively from first - principles . the matching to the @xmath10 scheme",
    "is done by computing renormalization factors in perturbation theory ( wilson and overlap ) .",
    "simulations with wilson fermions are now also performed in full qcd , but many discrepancies between lattice and experiment remain .",
    "more control on the systematic errors is required .",
