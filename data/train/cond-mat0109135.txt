    "in recent years , there have been a number of theoretical and experimental studies of the manner in which coulomb blockade effects in a metallic particle or semiconductor quantum dot disappear when the conducting island becomes more electrically connected to its environment .",
    "here we focus on a system in which two symmetric quantum dots are defined by applying negative voltages to gate electrodes that lie on the surface of a semiconductor heterostructure above a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "we assume that the dots are joined by a quantum point contact containing a single orbital channel that is almost perfectly transmitting at the fermi energy , but that the dots are isolated from their respective leads by comparatively large tunnel barriers . in this geometry ,",
    "information about the coulomb blockade energy @xmath0 involved in the transfer of electrons from one dot to the other can be obtained by observing the positions of coulomb blockade peaks in the conductance across the entire system ( from one lead to another ) when that conductance is plotted as a function of voltages on gates coupled to each of the dots .",
    "@xcite    previous analyses of the disappearance of the coulomb blockade for two - dot systems  @xcite containing such a partially open point contact have characterized the contact by a number @xmath2 of degenerate one - dimensional ( 1d ) channels and by the dimensionless conductance @xmath3 of each channel ( where @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xcite this characterization is complete in the limit where the electronic transmission amplitude through the contact is independent of energy for electron energies that differ from the fermi energy by no more than an amount comparable to @xmath0 .",
    "the energy independence of the transmission amplitude means that this characterization corresponds to a potential barrier which is sufficiently thin that it can be modeled as a delta function .",
    "because the coulomb blockade energy @xmath0 is much smaller than the fermi energy @xmath11 , working in this `` delta - function barrier limit '' can yield good results even though the product of the barrier width and the fermi wave vector @xmath12 is generally much greater than @xmath8 ( with @xmath12 being the value of the fermi wave vector in the 2deg far from the barrier ) .",
    "nevertheless , it seems important to investigate further the consequences of relaxing the assumption of a delta - function barrier limit .",
    "for one thing , it is possible to generate wider barriers using an appropriate gate geometry , and one would like to understand at what point the delta - function - limit calculations break down . secondly , estimating the corrections due to a barrier s finite thickness provides a valuable check on the delta - function - limit results .",
    "another reason for interest is that recent experiments on transmission through quantum point contacts have shown unexpected structure ( e.g. , an apparent conductance plateau near @xmath13 at intermediate temperatures",
    "@xcite ) whose origin is only poorly understood .",
    "such results suggest that transmission through a point contact may have a nontrivial energy dependence , and such a dependence could well have an effect on the breakdown of the coulomb blockade in the coupled - dot geometry . with the aim of explaining such effects in mind , it is a helpful first step to study theoretically the effects of energy dependences in a simpler situation where the barrier potential is known and many - body effects are reduced to a bare minimum . in this vein",
    "we consider here a model in which the two dots are separated by a parabolic barrier of nonzero width and the electron - electron interaction is taken to be constant for any two electrons located anywhere on the same quantum dot .",
    "this model presents challenges for `` bosonization techniques '' that characterize point - contact constrictions as one - dimensional fermionic seas whose low - energy degrees of freedom can be expressed in terms of bosonic density and phase variables .",
    "@xcite in such `` bosonized '' models , the behavior of incompletely opened channels is commonly studied by introducing a zero - width delta - function barrier at a specific point in the one - dimensional sea .",
    "@xcite by way of contrast , this paper seeks to show how a bosonized model of a one - dimensional system can describe the single - particle effects of replacing a delta - function barrier with a barrier that more realistically corresponds to a finite - length constriction  i.e . , a barrier of nonzero width and therefore nontrivial single - particle transmission properties .",
    "before proceeding , we should describe more fully what is already understood about systems of two symmetric quantum dots connected by a single orbital channel containing degenerate spin modes .",
    "in such systems , an energy scale @xmath0 characterizes the energy cost of moving electronic charges between different segments of the system .",
    "moreover , the system s coulomb blockade behavior reflects the presence of an energy term proportional to @xmath0 that oscillates between one value held when the total number of electrons on the dots is even and another value held when the total electron number is odd .  @xcite    previous work , both experimental and theoretical , has shown that as the conductance of the interdot point contact is increased , the energy scale associated with this even - odd alternation is reduced by a factor of @xmath1 , where @xmath14 goes to @xmath8 when the channel is fully open . when the transmission coefficient for electronic motion within this channel is independent of energy ( i.e. , the delta - function barrier limit ) , the factor @xmath1 takes on a universal value determined solely by the number of point contact channels @xmath2 ( the channels being assumed degenerate and uncoupled ) and the dimensionless conductance @xmath3 of each individual channel ( if @xmath15 is the total conductance of the point contact , @xmath16 . ) .",
    "we refer to the value @xmath14 in the factor @xmath1 as the _ fractional peak splitting _ because it has been measured by observing the relative separation of conductance peaks in a series of coulomb blockade experiments .",
    "this paper studies the corrections to @xmath14 , and therefore to @xmath1 , that result when the assumption of a delta - function barrier limit is relaxed  in other words , when the interdot barrier is more realistically treated as having a finite height and nonzero width .",
    "a prior study of the effects of a nonzero - width barrier concentrated on the limit of weakly coupled dots ( the limit @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xcite this study revealed that , if the one - dimensional channels between two dots , or between a dot and a lead , contain a tunneling barrier of finite height @xmath18 ( in energy units ) and of nonzero width @xmath19 , the behavior of such systems is responsive to another energy scale , @xmath20 , that characterizes the energy range ( for electrons incident on the barrier ) over which the probability of transmission through the barrier varies substantially .",
    "@xcite for relatively large and shallow dots , such as those that have been constructed in gaas / algaas heterostructures at low temperatures ,  @xcite the energies @xmath0 and @xmath20 tend to be much smaller than the fermi energy @xmath11 but much larger than both the single - particle level spacing @xmath21 and the thermal energy @xmath22 . as a result",
    ", such systems are characterized by the following hierarchy of energy scales :  @xcite @xmath23 because @xmath20 is comparable in size to the intermediate energy scale @xmath0 ( which acts as a kind of `` excitation energy scale '' with respect to independent - particle energies ) , effects from the barrier s finite size can be significant and deserve investigation before they are confidently discarded .    our prior study of the weak - coupling limit where @xmath24 found that the finiteness of the barrier leads to an upward correction to the universal @xmath14-versus-@xmath3 curve for a delta - function barrier . in other words , for a given _ small _ value of @xmath3 , the fractional peak splitting @xmath14 is enhanced relative to its value for a delta - function barrier .  @xcite this enhancement occurs because , in a channel containing a barrier with a finite energy height ( as opposed to a delta - function barrier ) , electrons can tunnel from one dot to another through largely unreflected states that have single - particle energies greater than the energy that corresponds to the finite barrier s peak .",
    "@xcite    in order to study the correction to the universal @xmath14-versus-@xmath3 curve , in our prior work we made several basic assumptions about the system of two symmetric dots connected by a single orbital channel .",
    "first , we assumed that the electrons that enter the point contact between the dots are in the lowest energy eigenstate for motion perpendicular to the channel and can therefore be described by a one - dimensional ( 1d ) schrdinger equation with an effective barrier potential @xmath25 .",
    "we assumed that @xmath25 could be treated as parabolic , with a harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath5 associated with the inverted parabolic well .",
    "( in this case , the transmission energy scale @xmath20 is given by @xmath26 . ) in addition , we assumed that , despite the nonzero width of the barrier , the essential nature of electron - electron interactions was still accurately represented by the standard coulomb blockade model , in which the interaction energy of a quantum dot is analogous to that of a classical capacitor ",
    "i.e . , proportional to the charge on the dot squared .",
    "having made these assumptions , we found that , in the limit @xmath17 , the leading behavior of the enhancement to @xmath14 is roughly proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "for the experimental systems with which we are concerned , where @xmath2 is @xmath8 or @xmath28 and where @xmath29 , the size of the enhancement is relatively small .",
    "@xcite    this paper extends study of such finite - barrier corrections to the strong - coupling limit where @xmath30 . in doing so",
    ", we repeat the two assumptions described above .",
    "the assumption of a parabolic form for the imposed barrier potential is likely as good as before .",
    "@xcite however , our simplistic treatment of the electron - electron interactions is likely less firm , given that the point contact is now largely open and therefore much more likely to be occupied by electrons interacting in a way not reflected by the standard capacitive coulomb blockade model . nonetheless , because the barrier region is still small in relation to the larger conducting basins of the two dots , and because the effects from a combination of the coulomb blockade model and the interdot barrier s finite size are themselves sufficiently interesting and complex , in this initial stab at the problem of finite barriers we ignore the effects of interactions specific to the point contact , with the understanding that separate efforts to understand those effects should follow .",
    "thus , the basic parameters for our strong - coupling study are the same as those for the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the @xmath2 degenerate spin channels are assumed to contain effectively identical barriers , and the interdot barrier can be modeled as fully parabolic so long as we are concerned only with energies within a restricted range about the barrier peak .",
    "we therefore describe the single interdot orbital channel as containing the potential : @xmath31 see figure  1 .",
    "as we will later see , our ultimate results are independent of the potential s details away from the barrier peak .",
    "key aspects of the barrier potential are the `` depth '' ( @xmath32 ) of its peak relative to the fermi surface and the harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath33 associated with the inverted parabolic well .",
    "@xcite ( note that @xmath34 , which is assumed to be much less than @xmath8 . )",
    "we use the single - particle eigenfunctions that correspond to the above potential to calculate corrections to @xmath14 . to do so , we incorporate these eigenfunctions in a generalization of a bosonization approach   that was used earlier in the delta - function barrier limit .",
    "we first find the change in the two - dot system s ground state energy as the value of @xmath35 is increased from zero .",
    "this energy shift @xmath36 is a function of @xmath35 and another dimensionless quantity @xmath37 , which represents a linear combination of the gate voltages applied to the two dots .",
    "@xcite when the total number of electrons on the two dots is even , the fractional peak splitting @xmath14 is given by the following formula : @xmath38 by applying this formula , we find that , consistent with our earlier conjecture ,  @xcite for both @xmath39 and @xmath40 the leading finite - barrier corrections _ decrease _ the value of @xmath14 observed for a given value of @xmath3 when @xmath3 is close to @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath41 and @xmath30 , the magnitude of the decrease is proportional to @xmath42 for @xmath6 and to @xmath43 for @xmath7 .",

    "to calculate the corrections due to the interdot barrier s nonzero width , we start with a fermionic formulation of our system of two symmetric quantum dots connected by a single orbital channel containing an arbitrary number @xmath2 of degenerate spin modes .",
    "since this fermionic problem is effectively one - dimensional ,  @xcite we can apply to it a variation of the standard technique of bosonization .",
    "@xcite having `` bosonized '' the problem , we integrate out various bosonic degrees of freedom to obtain a low - energy effective action involving only a single set of scalar fields .",

    "[ eq : nparts ] .",
    "first , we should note that derivation of the above equation for @xmath91 ignores contributions to @xmath92 from integrating over some interior portion of the barrier region in which approximating the single - particle wavefunctions by plane waves , or at least by wkb approximations to plane waves , is no longer valid . hence  because the exact eigenfunctions in the barrier region ( parabolic cylinder functions ) do not `` explode '' in amplitude as one goes further toward the center of the barrier  @xcite  as in our derivation of analogous identities in the limit of weakly coupled dots ,  @xcite we expect additive corrections of rough order @xmath19 to the eq .",
    "[ eq : nparts ] cofactors @xmath93 . consequently ,",
    "to avoid substantial corrections to eq .",
    "[ eq : nparts ] , we must be able to restrict our attention to wave - vectors @xmath94 ( measured from the appropriate fermi wave vector in one dimension ) such that @xmath95 because the exponentially variant function @xmath89 strongly favors values of @xmath96 that correspond to @xmath97 near @xmath98 , the @xmath96 of most interest for calculating corrections to the universal behavior are those for which @xmath99 .",
    "the above restriction on @xmath96 can thus be seen to mean that we need @xmath100 .",
    "for systems ( such as those this paper seeks to model ) in which @xmath101 , the restriction then reduces ( conservatively speaking ) to @xmath102 or , equivalently , @xmath103 . given that the relevant experiments with quantum dot systems  @xcite have generally not resolved @xmath3 to increments of @xmath104 , this constraint is not a serious one .    as a second point regarding eq .",
    "[ eq : nparts ] , it should be noted that , for @xmath102 , this intermediate result ( and therefore those that follow from it ) is insensitive to details of the barrier away from the barrier peak ( e.g. , the slope discontinuities that occur in our barrier potential at @xmath105 ) so long as @xmath19 is large compared to the inverse fermi wave vector @xmath106 ( with the fermi wavelength itself being of the order of @xmath107 , the wavelength associated with the peak barrier energy , @xmath108 ) .",
    "the condition @xmath109 is typically true of the kinds of quantum dots that have motivated these investigations .",
    "@xcite    a third remark about eq .",
    "[ eq : nparts ] is that in deriving @xmath91 , we have ignored a correction involving terms of the form @xmath110 - 1)/(k_2 - k_1 \\pm i \\eta)$ ] .",
    "we ignored similar `` phase - based '' terms in ref .",
    "the basic reason that we ignore these terms here derives from the fact that , because the characteristic excitation energy @xmath0 is less than @xmath87 , the variation of the numerator of these terms over any region of particular interest should be very small . as a result , in the regions that we generally find to be most important ( those regions near the simple poles where @xmath111 and the magnitudes of other contributing terms tend toward infinity ) , these phase - based terms go to zero",
    "thus , we have good reason to expect that the contribution from these phase - based terms is small compared to the contribution from the terms we keep . indeed ,",
    "if we follow the calculation of the lowest - order contribution from these terms further , we would find that , by reasoning parallel to that used in sec .",

    "@xcite thus , to find the leading behavior of the fractional peak splitting as a function of @xmath35 and @xmath9 , we can simply substitute @xmath260 for @xmath262 in the results previously obtained for a delta - function barrier .",
    "as for one - channel systems , we ultimately resort to numerical integration to solve for the fractional peak splitting when the barrier has a nonzero width .",
    "needless to say , it is gratifying that such numerical calculation confirms that , at least through five significant digits , the prefactor @xmath260 converges to the delta - function quantity @xmath262 in the limit @xmath263 .",
    "consequently , in the limit of a narrow barrier , we recover the same result as for a delta - function barrier  @xcite  a good confirmation both of the robustness of our earlier results and of our success in wending through the complications created by the initial assumption of a nonzero - width barrier .",
    "the approach to performing the quadruple integral of eq .",
    "[ eq : zmess ] is very similar to that used to perform the analogous quadruple integral for @xmath6 and therefore will not be described in depth .",
    "we first integrate over @xmath179 and @xmath159 by techniques of complex analysis similar to those used for @xmath6 , once again focusing on the simple poles at @xmath264 , with the understanding that this imposes a constraint that @xmath265 . for various values of @xmath9",
    ", we then do the remaining integrals over @xmath151 and @xmath152 numerically .",
    "the results are shown in figure  3 . as for one - channel systems",
    ", we see that as @xmath177 increases , the strong - coupling end of the @xmath14-versus-@xmath3 curve shifts downward from the zero - width result . once again",
    ", the corrections for the experimentally realized values of @xmath266 are small , a fact which confirms that the previous assumption of a delta - function barrier  @xcite was substantially justified , at least so long as interaction effects peculiar to the barrier region can be ignored .",
    "= 0.9 +    as for the single - channel system , one might inquire about the nature of the leading analytic behavior of these corrections .",
    "the answer is essentially parallel , both in reasoning and substance , to that found at the end of sec .",
    "the constraints on @xmath35 are the same ( i.e. , @xmath267 ) , and the leading finite - barrier corrections to @xmath260 are expected to be roughly proportional to @xmath268 when @xmath41 . in other words , @xmath260 can be expanded as follows : @xmath269 where @xmath270 is a small positive number . because , from prior work ,   the leading corrections to the fractional peak splitting are proportional to @xmath271 at @xmath272 , the leading finite - barrier correction to the fractional peak splitting is roughly proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "the corrections shown in figure  3 follow this predicted behavior quite well : for @xmath273 , the analytic prediction captures the calculated corrections with error margins of about 10% or less for the @xmath35-dependence and of about 20% or less for the @xmath9-dependence .",
    "the numerical results suggest that @xmath270 is slightly less than @xmath274 .",
    "this paper shows that bosonization techniques for studying the behavior of one - dimensional systems need not be abandoned when finite - length barriers ( or constrictions ) are introduced .",
    "the finite - length effects of those barriers can be captured to leading order by a standard perturbative approach , albeit one that requires complicated calculations and a fair degree of care .",
    "thus , bosonization techniques can still be useful when nontrivial behavior in the barrier region is at issue , and the approach presented in this paper may help investigators to distinguish between single - particle and many - particle effects from a barrier s finite length .    with regard to the more particular problem of the coulomb blockade behavior of coupled quantum dots ,",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "this paper shows that at least for one - channel or two - channel systems , the fractional peak splitting @xmath14 of two strongly coupled dots decreases , for a given value of the interdot conductance , as the ratio @xmath9 is increased . for one - channel systems ( @xmath6 )",
    ", the downward correction behaves as @xmath268 in the limit where @xmath41 and @xmath30 .",
    "thus , for @xmath6 , the fractional peak splitting has the following leading - order functional form : @xmath275 where @xmath276 is somewhat less than 0.05 and , as derived in prior work ,  @xcite @xmath277 ( about @xmath278 ) . in two - channel systems ( @xmath7 ) , and in the same limits , the downward correction due to the finite barrier width behaves as @xmath43 , resulting in leading - order behavior of the form @xmath279 where @xmath280 is somewhat less than @xmath281 and , as derived in prior work ,   @xmath282 ( or about @xmath283 ) .",
    "( it should be noted that prior results indicate that , in the @xmath7 equation , the next additive term independent of @xmath9 will equal @xmath284 , where @xmath285 .",
    "@xcite because this term linear in @xmath35 comes from higher - order terms in the effective action than those we have considered here ( see , e.g. , eq .",
    "[ eq : spinactfin ] ) , we have omitted it in our calculations and in the graphs of figure  3 in order to have a truer comparison between the @xmath9-dependent terms and those they directly correct .",
    "if need be , the linear term is easy enough to combine with the result expressed in eq .",
    "[ eq : f2approx ] . )",
    "the above results combine with an earlier study of the weak - coupling regime ( @xmath24 )  @xcite to give a more complete understanding of the @xmath14-versus-@xmath3 curve when one leaves the delta - function barrier limit @xmath263 .",
    "in particular , we come to the nontrivial conclusion that , for the experimentally realized values of @xmath266 ,  @xcite the corrections to the results derived from modeling the barrier as a delta function are not fundamentally substantial ; thus , to this extent at least , earlier theoretical work using a delta - function potential was correct .",
    "in addition to confirming the essential nature of the @xmath14-versus-@xmath3 curve for @xmath41 , this paper has helped us gain a better picture of what happens to the @xmath14-versus-@xmath3 curve for more general values of @xmath9 .",
    "the weak - coupling results suggested that , as @xmath9 is increased , the @xmath14-versus-@xmath3 curve shifts upward for small values of @xmath3 ( i.e. , for @xmath24 ) and becomes flatter for intermediate values of @xmath3 .",
    "the strong - coupling results suggest ( as conjectured ) that , as the same ratio is increased , the @xmath14-versus-@xmath3 curve shifts downward for large values of @xmath3 ( i.e. , for @xmath30 ) and becomes flatter for intermediate values of @xmath3 .",
    "together , the two sets of results suggest that , in the limit of an extremely wide , `` adiabatic '' barrier ( @xmath286 ) , the @xmath14-versus-@xmath3 curve will be essentially flat for values of @xmath3 in an intermediate region between @xmath98 and @xmath8 .",
    "for such an adiabatic barrier , the @xmath14-versus-@xmath3 curve will sit at some essentially constant value of @xmath14 for most of this interval and will turn sharply toward the limiting values of @xmath287 and @xmath288 at the edges .    for the moment ,",
    "the intermediate value at which the `` adiabatic '' @xmath14-versus-@xmath3 curve sits remains a mystery .",
    "the weak - coupling results displayed an antisymmetry around @xmath289 that , if true at higher orders , might aid in solving for the fractional peak splitting when @xmath3 takes on intermediate values .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , the strong - coupling results do not exhibit such a simple symmetry . as",
    "figures  1 and 2 indicate , unlike the weak - coupling results , the strong - coupling results do not reveal a common point of intersection for the leading - order curves that correspond to different values of @xmath9 .",
    "the apparent lack of a common pivot will presumably make solution of the intermediate-@xmath3 problem more difficult .",
