    "cylindrically symmetric space - times , cosmic strings and cosmic cylinders in particular , are an important subclass of the full axial geometries , with a symmetry structure in many ways more complex than the spherically symmetric backgrounds .",
    "although not compatible with asymptotic flatness , cylindrical solutions have been studied in many different physically meaningful contexts .",
    "definitions and structural aspects have been investigated in @xcite . in cosmology and astrophysics",
    "they have been used to model the formation of structure @xcite , gravitational lensing effect @xcite and gamma ray bursts @xcite . in condensed matter",
    ", they appear in the study of superconductivity and topological defects @xcite .    beside formalism issues and phenomenological applications , cosmic strings display a variety of different phenomena .",
    "they are important for the study of einstein general relativity in extreme situations , where the limits of the theory can be explored and information about very new phenomena can be gathered . for example , they have been used to model time - machines @xcite .",
    "cylindrical space - times frequently have cuts in the angular variable . in case",
    "there is a rotation , one can imagine a voyager along the angular direction with an effectively superluminal velocity in a closed space - time path , hence a time machine .",
    "thus , such geometries are generally associated with the possibility of traveling back in time , always a puzzling possibility @xcite .",
    "hence the question whether these space - times are physically feasible .",
    "effective superluminal velocities are not necessarily a pathology .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , it has been shown that in braneworlds a gravitational sign can be sent through the bulk in a way that it can reach a distant point in the brane faster than light propagating in the brane .",
    "however , such signs seem to be irrelevant , because most of them advance , compared to a light sign , by negligibly small amounts .",
    "if we take causality as a fundamental principle , it is reasonable to conjecture that time machines can not be constructed in the real world , although they are possible as exact solutions of einstein equations .",
    "it is expected that these time machines do not survive as physical solutions , but we do not yet know any physical mechanism that prohibits the existence of such backgrounds .    in this work ,",
    "we propose such mechanism , associating closed time - like curves to instabilities in certain cylindrical geometries .",
    "taking the spherically symmetric cases as reference , not much has been stated about the stability of cosmic strings .",
    "this is specially true for rotating cosmic strings , which are relevant for time machine theoretical proposals .",
    "one exception , in the braneworld context , is the well known gregory - laflamme @xcite instability in the black strings .",
    "we have calculated the evolution of a massive scalar field propagating in different cosmic string and cosmic cylinder backgrounds .",
    "the relevant boundary conditions to be satisfied by a massive scalar field are presented .",
    "these conditions will be part of the quasinormal mode definition , which will be calculated considering these backgrounds .",
    "the static cases will be treated in the first place , because the rotating geometries present closed time - like curves ( ctcs ) and in these cases additional analysis is necessary to render the problem tractable . analyzing the behavior of the field and their quasinormal modes we could present evidence of the stability of some of these space - times .",
    "the metric of a stationary and cylindrically symmetric space - time is given by an expression of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 are functions only of the radial coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "all space - times studied here are described by this ansatz .",
    "we start with the static cosmic cylinder background .",
    "it was obtained by gott and hiscock @xcite and its exterior solution is given by @xmath3 where the coordinates range are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",

    "there are at least two possible regular solutions .",

    "in the static cosmic cylinder backgrounds , the space - time is divided in two different regions .",
    "therefore , we need to specify junction and boundary asymptotic conditions .",
    "namely , the scalar field in the interior region @xmath72 must be regular at the origin , the field and its derivative must be continuous on the border @xmath25 of the cosmic cylinder and only outgoing waves can escape to infinity .",
    "hence , these boundary conditions can be summarized as @xmath73 where @xmath47 is a complex frequency of oscillation the scalar field .",
    "when the space - time does not have a regular interior region , as the static cosmic string , only ( [ bcstcs1 ] ) and ( [ bcstcs3 ] ) are used as boundary conditions . in the case of rotating space - times",
    "we need additional conditions to make the quasinormal mode problem well - posed .",
    "the difficulty is related to the fact that the space - times under consideration are not globally hyperbolic .",
    "although this is not an insuperable obstacle , further considerations must be made @xcite .    specifically , there is a region @xmath74 where the temporal coordinate is not globally well defined because the vector fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 are time - like .",
    "a compact temporal coordinate @xmath42 leads to closed time - like curves . to deal with this problem",
    "we follow the approach developed by novikov , thorne , friedman and others , imposing a `` self - consistency principle''@xcite , which roughly states that all events on ctcs influence each other around closed time - like lines in a self - adjusted way .",
    "one implementation of the self - consistency principle in the dynamical systems discussed in this article is done imposing that the propagation of scalar field is periodic in the space - time regions that are identified .",
    "labelling these regions by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we impose @xmath79 . in the case of rotating cosmic cylinder space - times ,",
    "this condition is satisfied in the causal region .",
    "what we need to do is to extent this condition to the non - causal region .",
    "we have @xmath80 with this supplementary condition , the propagation of scalar fields become tractable .      in this section an analysis concerning causality is presented .",
    "the presence of closed time - like curves can be verified analyzing whether @xmath81 somewhere . in our space - times , the non - causal region are infinitely long hollow cylinders .    the @xmath82 components of the static cosmic string and cylinder are always positive - definite if @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the static cases can be declared causally well - behaved .",
    "the rotating cases need to be analyzed one by one .",
    "the rotating cosmic string admits a non - causal region with arbitrary size depending on the constants @xmath11 and @xmath21 . in fig .",
    "[ figomega1 ] one can see how these constants change the size of non - causal region .",
    "there is no restriction for values of @xmath21 but the linear mass density must be bounded .",
    "the other two cases of rotating cosmic cylinders are more complex than the rotating cosmic string . for simplicity , we choose to preserve the interior region , which contains matter , against ctcs , reducing the range of the parameters .",
    "the exterior of the rotating cosmic cylinder may have ctcs . in case of the  flower pot \" model",
    "the interior @xmath82 component is always positive - definite , and therefore there is no ctc . in the exterior , the condition to have ctcs depends essentially on @xmath22 being given by @xmath83 if @xmath84 is large enough @xmath85 resulting in the absence of a non - causal region . in fig .",

    "a general analysis is quite difficult because of the number of free parameters .",
    "each case must be analyzed independently , verifying whether the set of chosen constants satisfies given restrictions .",
    "the causal structure this space - time will depend on the adjustment of three constants @xmath25 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . analyzing the interior @xmath82 component we can see that it can assume negative values . recalling that we do not want ctcs in the interior solution , the set of constants must be chosen such that @xmath82 is positive - definite .",
