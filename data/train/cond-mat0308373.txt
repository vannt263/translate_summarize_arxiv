    "in his pioneering work in 1948 , casimir introduced the notion of fluctuation  induced forces when he showed that quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields can generate measurable long - ranged forces between conducting plates @xcite .",
    "the idea , however , has been subsequently generalized to various cases where : ( i ) the fluctuations are of classical thermal origin , ( ii ) the fluctuating media are complex fluids , and ( iii ) the boundaries are moving @xcite .    in light of the extensive development of the original idea of fluctuation  induced interactions , it may seem quite natural to ask what happens if the fluctuations that cause the interaction are of nonequilibrium nature .",
    "a first attempt towards answering this question was made by g.i .",

    ", taylor has shown that two flagella undergoing wavelike harmonic deformations have a tendency to attract each other , because their undulations introduce ( nonequilibrium ) hydrodynamic fluctuations in the surrounding viscous fluid that could induce an effective interaction between them .",
    "more recently , another generalization has been introduced where localized sources drive the fluctuating medium out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we also note that the idea of depletion forces @xcite , which are also fluctuation  induced in origin , has been generalized to systems driven out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting way of driving a thermally fluctuating system out of equilibrium is by imposing spatial or temporal variations in the temperature profile .",
    "many interesting phenomena are known to appear under such conditions , ranging from anomaly in diffusion to the old problem of thermophoresis or soret effect @xcite . in this effect ,",
    "whose microscopic mechanism is still subject to debate @xcite , solutions of colloidal particles @xcite or polymers @xcite that are placed in a temperature gradient experience separation , which signals the appearance of a net driving force on particles as a result of the temperature gradient .",
    "it has also been recently shown that inhomogeneity in the temperature profile could lead to deviation of the self - diffusion coefficient of a tracer undergoing brownian motion from the simplistic local einstein s relation @xcite .",

    "we consider a near - equilibrium fluctuating system in which we can define local and instantaneous temperature .",
    "we study the dynamics of a classical scalar field governed by a langevin equation , in which the strength of the noise is proportional to the local and instantaneous temperature in the system .",
    "we consider external objects that restrict the fluctuations of the scalar field and calculate the resulting fluctuation  induced stress on these objects .",
    "we concentrate on the examples of a single flat plate as well as two parallel plates , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ onetwo ] , immersed in various temperature profiles . for the case of a single plate , we find that a net force is exerted on the plate due to the imbalance of the fluctuation  induced forces from the two sides , which has a tendency to push it to the colder regions .",
    "we also calculate the casimir force between two parallel plates in nonuniform temperature profiles and find that the two plates experience different forces in violation of the third law of newton .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in secs .",

    "let us consider an equilibrium system described by a scalar field @xmath0 that undergoes thermal fluctuations in a space that is bounded by a number of external objects .",
    "the field could represent a component of the electromagnetic field ( e.g. the electric potential ) in a dielectric medium or vacuum @xcite , an order parameter field for a critical binary mixture or a magnetic system @xcite , a massless goldstone mode arising from a continuous symmetry breaking such as nematic liquid crystals or superfluid helium , an elastic deformation field for fluctuating membranes and surfaces , or the electrostatic potential in charged fluids at very low salt concentrations @xcite . in all of the above systems , it is possible to write down a hamiltonian for the fluctuations around the equilibrium state , which in gaussian approximation reads @xmath1 ^ 2 , \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is an elastic modulus describing the stiffness of the system for the fluctuations around equilibrium state .",
    "we consider the situation where temperature has a slowly varying profile such that thermal equilibrium can be achieved locally .",
    "this means that we have many heat reservoirs locally in contact with our system , which have different temperatures .",
    "the temperature difference between neighboring reservoirs should be sufficiently small so that the condition of local equilibrium is fulfilled .",
    "similarly , we can consider a temperature profile with temporal variations that are sufficiently slow such that instantaneous equilibrium state can be defined .",

    "we consider both the case of a single plate of area @xmath3 , as well as two such parallel plates separated by a distance @xmath4 .",
    "we choose the @xmath5 axis to be the normal direction to the plates , such that the three dimensional position vector can be represented as @xmath6 .",
    "we assume the dirichlet boundary condition , which means that the fluctuating field @xmath7 is restricted to vanish on the plates .",
    "the physical quantity that we would like to calculate for such systems is the pressure or the normal force per unit area exerted on each plate from the fluctuating medium . in the prescribed geometry",
    ", this will be @xmath8the @xmath9 component of the stress tensor . using the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , one can calculate the components of the stress tensor in terms of the two point correlation functions of the field .",
    "for example , the local pressure exerted from the right side on the plate that is located at @xmath10 is given as @xmath11 where the minus sign denotes that this pressure tends to push the plate to the @xmath12 direction .",
    "( note that the normal to plate at this point is in @xmath13 direction . )",
    "a similar definition and expression can be given for the pressure from the left side @xmath14 , and the total normal force per unit area @xmath15 exerted on the plate in the positive @xmath5 direction .",
    "note that due to the translational symmetry of the infinite plates in the parallel directions , the lateral forces are all zero , even for the case where temperature is not uniform .",
    "for calculating the correlation functions in the local and instantaneous near - equilibrium states resulted from a prescribed temperature profile , we use the fact that the such states could be reachable through an equilibrium dynamical relaxation .",
    "we assume a dynamical langevin equation as @xmath16 with the boundary conditions @xmath17 . here",

    "in this section we focus on the example of a single plate that is embedded in a fluctuating background with local temperature .",
    "when the temperature profile is uniform , the stress resulted from the field configurations on the left side cancels completely with the corresponding counterpart coming from the right side , and the plate experiences no net force .",
