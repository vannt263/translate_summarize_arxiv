    "the objective of this research is the formulation of a new algorithm for the graphical reconstruction of unknown surfaces which partition the three dimensional space into disjoint sets .",
    "even if some techniques to prove the existence of invariant sets have already been developed , none of them , except for particular and well - known cases , allows to have a graphical representation of the separatrix manifolds ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we extend previous preliminary studies @xcite , to obtain an algorithm , written as a matlab routine , which is able to reconstruct the boundaries of the basins of attraction of different stable equilibria .",
    "the numerical tools that are involved are : ( i ) a bisection - like routine to detect the points lying on the separatrix manifold ; ( ii ) a reduction scheme to select only the most significant of them , thereby reducing redundancy and incrementing spatial uniformity ; and ( iii ) the interpolation reconstruction based on the partition of unity method .",
    "compactly supported radial basis functions ( csrbfs ) are used for the local approximations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , because they are effective and efficient .",
    "indeed they interpolate accurately and stably large numbers of scattered data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we now briefly illustrate the importance of having such a versatile tool available in applied sciences . in mathematical applications",
    "to real life problems , dynamical systems constitute a powerful modeling tool .",
    "in general , the trajectories in the phase space usually tend to stable equilibrium configurations , although persistent oscillations or chaotic behavior can certainly arise for particular parameter settings @xcite . when these latter regimes do not arise , it is often the case that the model in consideration presents more than one possible stable equilibria for the same parameter values .",
    "the system outcome is in such case determined by its present state . in other words , trajectories with different initial conditions",
    "will possibly converge toward different equilibria , depending on the locations of their respective initial conditions .",
    "the set of all points that taken as initial conditions will have trajectories all tending to the same equilibrium is called the basin of attraction of that equilibrium point .",
    "it is then apparent that , to assess the future system s behavior , it is of paramount importance the accurate determination of these basins .",
    "nearby initial points could indeed lead to completely different system s outcomes .",
    "thus in real life phenomena , a detailed knowledge of the attraction basins allows to assess optimal configurations by bringing the system trajectory into a suitable attraction basin and away from the uncertainty of initial conditions close to the separatrices . in such cases",
    "a graphical knowledge of the attraction basins is therefore essential to check if the initial condition lies in a _",
    "safe _ area .    in this paper",
    "we describe efficient methods for the reconstruction of these domains .",
    "this is achieved by constructing procedures for the determination of the curves ( in 2d ) and surfaces ( in 3d ) that are the boundaries of these basins of attraction .",
    "the paper organization follows .",
    "section [ pu ] describes the basic tools for the approximation scheme , in particular the partition of unity method .",
    "the following section deals with the efficient implementation of the algorithm for the separatrix curves and surfaces . specifically , once we briefly illustrate for convenience of the reader the algorithm used to reconstruct separatrix curves , we present the technique for obtaining the surfaces separating two and three stable equilibria in systems with three differential equations .",
    "we then relate on the numerical results obtained in all these cases .",
    "finally , the concluding section summarizes the findings of the paper and analyzes some crucial steps of the algorithm which need further investigations .",
    "given a set of data , i.e. measurements and locations at which these measurements were obtained , the aim is to find a function @xmath0 which is a _ good _ fit to the given data . in the following our criterion for a good fit",
    "is that the function @xmath1 must exactly match to given measurements at the corresponding locations .",
    "this kind of problems arises in many scientific disciplines , such as physics , engineering , finance , biomathematics and medicine .",
    "typically , in applied sciences , the measurements taken either at different times or from different sensors or viewpoints are not sampled from a regular and uniform grid , but data are irregularly distributed or scattered . therefore , the approximation process of the rule which exactly matches the given measurements from irregular locations or data is commonly known as scattered data interpolation . in order to solve such problem we use meshfree or meshless methods since they allow to work with a large number of points .",
    "furthermore , obviously , they are independent from a mesh and thus they are suited for changes in the geometry of the domain .      in this subsection",
    "we briefly review the partition of unity approximation based on a localized use of rbf interpolants .",
    "given a set @xmath2 of @xmath3 distinct _ data points _ or _ nodes _ in a domain @xmath4 , and a corresponding set @xmath5 of _ data values _ or _ function values _",
    "obtained by sampling some ( unknown ) function @xmath6 , the standard rbf interpolation problem is to find an interpolant @xmath7 of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the euclidean norm , and @xmath10 is a rbf , @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 are determined by enforcing the interpolation conditions @xmath12 imposing the conditions leads to a symmetric linear system of equations @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16^t$ ] , and @xmath17^t$ ] .",
    "in next subsections we will consider @xmath18 strictly positive definite , since it guarantees the interpolation problem is well - posed , i.e. a solution to the problem exists and is unique .",
    "this follows from the fact that , using strictly positive definite functions the interpolation matrix is positive definite and hence nonsingular .",
    "the basic idea of the partition of unity method is to start with a partition of the open and bounded domain @xmath19 into @xmath20 subdomains @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 , with some mild overlap among the subdomains @xcite .",
    "the subdomains covering the domain @xmath19 are usually supposed to be circular patches .",
    "associated with the subdomains we choose partition of unity weight functions @xmath23 ,",
    "i.e. a family of compactly supported , nonnegative and continuous functions subordinate to the subdomain @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 on @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "then , for each subdomain @xmath21 , a local interpolation problem in the form is considered and the global approximant is given by : @xmath28    note that if the local approximants satisfy the interpolation conditions , then the global approximant also interpolates at this nodes since : @xmath29 where : @xmath30 according to @xcite , if we assume to have a @xmath31-stable partition of unity , then the derivatives of the weight functions satisfy @xmath32 is the diameter of @xmath24 and @xmath33 is a constant .    now , after defining the space @xmath34 of all functions @xmath35 whose derivatives of order @xmath36 satisfy @xmath37 for @xmath38 , we have the following approximation theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath39 be open and bounded and @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath42 be a strictly positive definite function .",
    "let @xmath43 be a regular covering for @xmath44 and let @xmath45 be @xmath46-stable for @xmath43 .",
    "then the error between @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the native space of @xmath49 , and its partition of unity interpolant ( [ intg ] ) can be bounded by @xmath50 @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 being the so - called _",
    "fill distance _ , whose definition is given by @xmath54    we require some additional assumptions on the regularity of @xmath24 :    1 .   for each @xmath55",
    "the number of subdomains @xmath24 with @xmath56 is bounded by a global constant @xmath57 ; 2 .",
    "each subdomain @xmath24 satisfies an interior cone condition ( see @xcite ) ; 3 .",
    "the local fill distances @xmath58 are uniformly bounded by the global fill distance @xmath53 , where @xmath59 .",
    "this local approach enables us to decompose a large problem into many small problems , and at the same time ensures that the accuracy obtained for the local fits is carried over to the global fit . in the reconstruction of the attraction",
    "basins the use of compactly supported radial basis functions , since it is well known that they guarantee a good compromise between accuracy and stability , is strongly advised .",
    "moreover usually , it can be highly advantageous to work with locally supported functions since they lead to sparse linear systems .",
    "thus in next subsection some widely used csrbfs will be illustrated .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the most popular families of csrbfs such as wendland s , wu s and gneiting s functions , @xcite .",
    "wendland @xcite found a class of rbfs which are smooth , compactly supported , and strictly positive definite .",
    "they consist of a product of a truncated power function and a low degree polynomial .    here",
    "we list few of the most commonly wendland s functions : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the so - called shape parameter .",
    "the functions are non negative for @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "another class of compactly supported and strictly positive definite functions is the class of wu s functions . similarly to the wendland s ones they are obtained by using the truncated power function . in what follows we report some examples of wu s functions : @xmath63    we conclude this subsection by illustating some examples of the class of the so - called gneiting s or oscillatory functions .",
    "this family can be obtained starting from the wendland s one , ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "as example , the following functions are strictly positive definite and radial on @xmath64 : @xmath65",
    "we remark that our aim is the reconstruction of separatrix surfaces partitioning a 3d phase state into two or more regions . anyway here , for convenience of the reader , we illustrate the basic numerical tools used to approximate separatrix curves . the differences from our previus work , @xcite , in the reconstruction of separatrix curves will be pointed out .",
    "they concern essentially the set of initial conditions used to find the separatrix points and the refinement algorithm .",
    "the latter is employed to find a set of nodes well distributed in the domain in which the separatrix curve is defined .",
    "the models used in our examples are a competition - like model for the 3d case and a dynamical system modeling infectious diseases for the 2d case .",
    "to test the robustness of our algorithm in a 2d dynamical system , when bistability occurs , we consider the following model describing a population affected by a disease , @xcite : @xmath66i , & \\textrm { } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the dimensionless total population that is composed of infecteds @xmath68 and susceptibles @xmath69 , ( see @xcite for further investigations ) .",
    "the allee effect governs the first equation .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are equilibria of the system , while for the study of the endemic steady states see @xcite .",
    "here we omit the analytical study of the model , already outlined in @xcite .",
    "as suggested by @xcite we set @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ; furthermore we fix @xmath77 . with this choice exists exactly one endemic steady state @xmath78 which is a stable equilibrium points .",
    "moreover the origin is stable , @xmath79 is an unstable equilibrium point and @xmath80 is the saddle point partitioning the phase plane domain .",
    "this situation suggests the existence of a curve separating the paths tending to disease - free equilibrium point from the trajectories tending to the endemic steady state .",
    "the separatrix curve divides the phase plane into two subregions , called basins of attraction of each respective equilibrium @xcite .",
    "trajectories originating in each of them tend to the unique equilibrium @xmath81 or @xmath82 which lies within the basin .    at first , to determine the separatrix curve for ( [ model2d_hilker ] ) , we need to consider a set of points as initial conditions in a square domain @xmath83 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath84(in the following we will fix @xmath85 ) .",
    "then we take points in pairs within @xmath83 ^ 2 $ ] and we check whether trajectories from these two points converge to different equilibria .",
    "if this the case , we then proceed with a bisection algorithm along the segment joining these points in order to determine a separatrix point .",
    "once we find a set of points on the separatrix , we perform a refinement of this set , which is then interpolated using a suitable method ( see section [ pu ] ) .",
    "more precisely , in the 2d case we start considering @xmath3 equispaced initial conditions on each edge of the square @xmath83 ^ 2 $ ] and the bisection algorithm is applied with the following initial conditions : @xmath86 @xmath87 in @xcite the set of initial conditions is taken as a grid of points on the square and for each possible couple of points the bisection - like routine is performed .",
    "it is evident that this approach is computationally expensive , compared with the one proposed here which consists in taking points only on the boundary of the square .",
    "moreover in view of performing a similar algorithm in the 3d case such a cheaper ( in terms of computational complexity ) procedure becomes essential .    performing the bisection algorithm ,",
    "a certain number of points is found on the separatrix curve .",
    "the @xmath88 points found by the bisection algorithm are collected in a matrix @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and then refined in order to obtain a smaller set of well distributed nodes on the separatrix curve .",
    "so we define : @xmath92 @xmath93 and we divide @xmath94 \\times [ 0,m_y]$ ] in @xmath95 subintervals",
    ". then we make an average of the separatrix points on each subintervals .    for example",
    ", figure [ figura1 ] ( top ) shows the points found using @xmath96 .",
    "choosing @xmath97 and considering the @xmath98 points picked up on the separatrix curve , the refinement process provides us the @xmath99 points reported in figure [ figura1 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "to this set we add the saddle point @xmath100 .",
    "the refined grid obtained in this way is then interpolated in order to find the separatrix .",
    "+      now we consider the following competition model ( see @xcite ) : @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 denote the three populations , each one competing with both the other ones in the same environment .",
    "we assume that all parameters are nonnegative : @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the growth rates of the three populations , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 denote the competition rates and @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the carrying capacities of @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",

    "<S> in this paper we consider the problem of reconstructing separatrices in dynamical systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , here we aim at partitioning the domain approximating the boundaries of the basins of attraction of different stable equilibria . </S>",
    "<S> we start from the 2d case sketched in @xcite and the approximation scheme presented in @xcite , and then we extend the reconstruction scheme of separatrices in the cases of three dimensional models with two and three stable equilibria . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we construct computational algorithms and procedures for the detection and the refinement of points located on the separatrix manifolds that partition the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the so - called meshfree or meshless methods is used to reconstruct the separatrices .    _ </S>",
