    "the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of closed quantum systems is nowadays a very active field of research ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the central question behind these efforts is to describe the dynamics of an isolated many - body system towards an eventual stationary state after it has been driven out of equilibrium .",
    "of particular interest are the properties of the equilibrium state itself .",
    "if simple correlation functions in this equilibrium state can be reproduced by means of a canonical ensemble the system is said to thermalize , which , interestingly , has been shown not to occur in certain situations  @xcite .",
    "these issues , that lie at the heart of statistical mechanics , have recently received a very strong impulse from the experiments with cold atomic gases .",
    "these systems are almost perfectly isolated from the environment and can remain quantum coherent for a long time compared with typical experiments duration allowing to study _ in situ _ the dynamics of large aggregates of interacting quantum particles  @xcite .    from the theoretical perspective",
    ", the non - equilibrium dynamics of large , interacting many - body systems settles a formidable challenge . among the several theoretical approaches at disposal ,",
    "different kinds of evolution equations for few - body correlations are being widely employed in the contemporary literature ( see , for example  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to numerical methods , which are confined either to small systems or short times , as for instance exact diagonalization or time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( t - dmrg ) , the solution of evolution equations allows to investigate the dynamics of large systems for relatively long times and usually demands a rather modest numerical effort .",
    "however , the deduction of these kind of equations starting from first principles , i.e. , the many - body schrdinger equation or its equivalents , often involves a series of uncontrolled approximations  @xcite that , although routinely utilized , can not be justified in all cases .",
    "on the other hand , the most studied type of evolution equations are kinetic equations , which are markovian , i.e. memoryless , equations for one - particle distribution functions , a typical example being the boltzmann equation . even though the markovian limit is well defined in some situations  @xcite it",
    "may not be always justified . in particular , in situations in which the system is reluctant to loose memory of the initial conditions ( such as integrable models ) markovian kinetic equations may be loosing important features of the relaxation dynamics .    in this work we present a method for constructing evolution equations for few body correlation functions in weakly interacting systems that involves no approximations beyond a series expansion in the small parameter quantifying the strength of the interaction .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are inherently non - markovian .",
    "the approach is based on the projection operator technique ( pot )  @xcite .",
    "we benchmark the method by comparing the solution of the equations with known results from one dimensional ( 1d ) systems .",
    "we consider a system of interacting spinless fermions with hamiltonian @xmath0 with @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are fermionic creation and annihilation operators satisfying canonical anticommutation relations , @xmath4 is the momentum - space matrix element of the interaction , @xmath5 is the dispersion relation , @xmath6 is the number operator and @xmath7 is the strength of the interaction .",
    "our results can be easily extended to the bosonic case .",
    "the hermiticity of the hamiltonian and the symmetry in the sum indices impose @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "furthermore , we will be interested in the special case of a translationally invariant hamiltonian in which the particles interact via a pair potential @xmath10 .",
    "in such case @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fourier transform of the potential and we have written the antisymmetrized version in order to respect the symmetry conditions of the potential .",
    "we are interested in the evolution of the system starting from an arbitrary initial condition given by a density matrix @xmath13 which we leave unspecified until the next section .",
    "our starting point is the liouville equation in the interaction representation ( @xmath14=1 ) : @xmath15=\\alpha l(t)\\tilde{\\rho}(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the interaction representation of the operator @xmath17 and we have introduced the liouville superoperator @xmath18 $ ] . our task is to find approximate solutions to the microscopic dynamics described by the liouville equation .",
    "the pot defines a program for achieving this .",
    "we need to first identify the `` slow '' or `` macroscopic '' variables in our system and then project the dynamics into the subspace of these slow variables . in a weakly interacting system",
    "the occupation number operators emerge as natural slow variables since @xmath19=\\mathcal{o}(\\alpha)$ ] . to perform the projection",
    "we first introduce the `` relevant '' density matrix @xmath20,\\ ] ] where the time - dependent partition function is given by @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath22 .",
    "the lagrange multipliers @xmath23 enforce the relation : @xmath24=\\mathrm{tr}[n({\\bm}{k})\\rho(t)].\\ ] ] in other words , @xmath25 is the density matrix that maximizes the von neumann entropy subject to the constraints  .",
    "we note that although the dynamics of @xmath26 is generated by the liouville equation , the relevant density matrix @xmath25 is time - dependent independently of the representation .",
    "the projection of the dynamics consists in finding an equation of motion for @xmath25 . to this end",
    "we introduce a projection super - operator @xmath27 that projects the relevant density matrix @xmath28 .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the literature to find an explicit expression for @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "it is also useful to define the complementary projector @xmath29 .",
    "following the usual steps  @xcite , from the liouville equation we obtain an equation for the slow dynamics @xmath30 where @xmath31 $ ] is an anti - chronologically ordered exponential . the first term in eq .",
    "is a mean - field term that vanishes due to momentum conservation , the second one is a memory term that can be completely expressed in terms of the past history of the @xmath32 s and the third term is a microscopic noise term that can not be expressed solely as a function of the slow variables .",
    "this last term vanishes if we choose an initial condition that has the same form as the relevant density matrices , i.e. , if @xmath33 , and we shall in the following circumscribe to this case .",
    ".   is equivalent to the liouville dynamics and , in general , as difficult to solve as the original problem .",
    "it sets , however , a good starting point for approximations . to render eq .",

    "this equation , in slightly different versions , has appeared many times in the literature . in ref .  @xcite it was derived using the same tools that we present here but it was used only as an intermediate step to derive the boltzmann equation whereas in refs .  @xcite it was heuristically derived and used to study the dynamics of infinite dimensional models and to derive a quantum version of the boltzmann equation , respectively .",
    "we want to stress that   is valid also for lattice systems in which only quasi - momentum is conserved .",
    "although the approach is clearly perturbative , the results go beyond conventional lowest order perturbation theory because the perturbation expansion is performed inside the integro - differential equations and , therefore , the coupling is involved in a highly non - linear way in the final expressions . to asses",
    "the accuracy of the approximation is thus not a straightforward task .",
    "one possible alternative is to calculate higher order corrections to eq .",
    ", which can be done systematically within the context of the projection operator technique",
    ". then , the error could be calculated as the relative difference between the lowest order and the next - to - leading order solutions  @xcite .",
    "we relegate such error analysis to future work .",
    "an alternative approach is to compare results with other techniques .",
    "for instance , performing a suitable short - times approximation on   ( details can be found in  @xcite ) it is possible to rederive results first obtained by moeckel and kehrein using the flow - equation approach in lowest order perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite it was found that the solution of eq .   compares well on the accessible timescales with dynamical mean - field theory results for the infinite dimensional hubbard model .",
    "below we provide an example for a 1d model in which the solution of the equation   captures highly non trivial features of the short - to - intermediate times relaxation . regarding the validity of the approach for longer timescales than those accessible for current numerical techniques , we should mention that under certain assumptions it can be shown  @xcite that eq .",
    "reduces , for long enough times , to the quantum boltzmann equation , which is expected to successfully describe the thermalization of isolated weakly interacting quantum systems after the system has effectively lost the information about the details of the initial conditions  @xcite .    with respect to implementation details , eq .   can be solved using standard techniques for systems of volterra integral equations  @xcite . a straightforward algorithm for the solution using , for instance ,",
    "the trapezoidal rule to perform the time integral , implies a calculation time that scales as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of times steps and @xmath43 the space dimension .",
    "we have found an algorithm whose execution time scales as @xmath44 allowing us to reach large sizes and times .",
