    "there are two salient properties of neutrinos related to neutrality which distinguish them from other known fermions :    - the possibility to have a majorana mass terms ;    - mix with new fermions which are singlets of the standard model ( sm ) symmetry group .",
    "so it would seem natural to explain unusual properties of neutrinos , such as smallness of masses and large mixing , using these two features .",
    "in fact , the see - saw mechanism  @xcite employs both .",
    "it may happen however that the see - saw mechanism is not enough to explain the pattern of the lepton mixing , especially if quark - lepton symmetry or unification are imposed . in this connection",
    ", we will concentrate on the second feature - the possibility of neutrinos to mix with singlets of the standard model , _",
    "i.e. _ , sterile neutrinos . in general ,",
    "sterile neutrinos may originate from some other sectors of the theory , _",
    "e.g. _ related to supersymmetry breaking or extra dimensions , and not coincide with the right handed components of neutrino fields .    in all , there are two types of effects of the mixing :    * direct effects - when new states can be produced in various processes and participate in neutrino oscillations , _ etc . _ ; * indirect effects - via the modification of the mass matrix of light active neutrinos .",
    "the role and relevance of these effects is determined by masses and mixings of sterile neutrinos . in some ranges of parameters",
    "the cosmological and astrophysical consequences of mixing are more important and the influence on the mass matrix is negligible . in other regions _",
    "vice versa _ : direct mixing effects are negligible - mixing becomes `` invisible '' but the modification of the mass matrix is substantial .    being light , sterile neutrinos can immediately take part in the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations changing the interpretation of experimental results  @xcite .",
    "being heavy and weakly mixed , they do not show up in oscillations and other processes , however their `` invisible '' mixing can strongly modify the mass matrix of active neutrinos and therefore change implications of neutrino results for theory . in particular , in this way , the presence of sterile neutrinos can induce the large or maximal mixing of the active neutrino components  @xcite , or , for instance , produce deviation of the 1 - 2 mixing from maximal  @xcite .    in a range of masses @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the energy release in processes , sterile neutrinos do not decouple since they still can be produced .",
    "they can decouple here in the sense that their direct dynamical effects are negligible due to the smallness of mixing . for bigger masses , @xmath15 , sterile neutrinos decouple , as it happens in the standard see - saw mechanism .",
    "this decoupling generates an additional contribution to the mass matrix of active neutrinos and gives negligible deviation from universality .    from observational point of view till now",
    "there is no clear evidences of existence of sterile neutrinos , though some hints exist .",
    "those include , the lsnd result @xcite and its interpretation in terms of oscillations in the ( 3 + 1 ) or ( 3 + 2 ) neutrino mixing schemes ; large scale structure formation in the universe with the warm dark matter composed of the kev sterile neutrinos @xcite ; high observed velocities of pulsars and their explanation as an asymmetric emission of the kev sterile neutrinos  @xcite ; the early reionization of the universe due to the radiative @xmath16 - decay  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study in details the possible effects of sterile - active mixing on the mass matrix of active neutrinos . we obtain bounds on these induced masses from the direct mixing effects .",
    "we find the impact of the induced matrix may be considerable if @xmath17  ev and @xmath18 or @xmath6 mev and @xmath7 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we determine the mass matrix induced by mixing of active neutrinos with a sterile one .",
    "we study the properties of the induced mass matrix and the possibility to explain certain features of the neutrino mass spectrum and mixing pattern using this matrix .",
    "we find values of mixing ( as a function of the mass of the sterile component ) for which the effect of the sterile neutrino ( i ) explains the dominant structures of the mass matrix ; ( ii ) produces the sub - dominant structures of the mass matrix ; ( iii ) can be neglected , being of the order or below the @xmath19 uncertainties of the present measurements . in sec .",
    "3 , we consider various bounds on masses and mixing of the sterile neutrino and consequently , on the induced matrix , in particular those from astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "we then , in sec . 4 , confront these bounds with regions found in sec . 2 and discuss how they can be improved in the future .",
    "we also comment on new physics scenarios which allow to evade the bounds .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",

    "also variations ( values ) of different elements are strongly correlated .",
    "the mass and mixing patterns in quark and lepton sectors are strongly different .",
    "the difference can ( at least partially ) originate from the active - sterile mixing which is absent in the quark sector .",
    "the shortcoming of this proposal is the coincidence problem : two different contributions to the mass matrix , active , @xmath55 , and induced , @xmath56 , are of the same order or within 1 - 2 orders of magnitude in spite of the fact that they have different , and at the first sight , unrelated origins .",
    "the only argument in favor is that this will be not the only case - we meet the coincidence problem in other areas too .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath57 .",
    "let us consider first the case of one sterile neutrino .",
    "due to the singular ( rank 1 ) character of the induced matrix it can not reproduce the dominant structures of the neutrino mass matrix in the case of the degenerate mass spectrum and inverted mass hierarchy . in the former case @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the scale of neutrino mass . in",
    "the latter - there are two dominant eigenvalues and the determinant of the 1 - 2 submatrix is non - zero .",
    "essentially this means that the matrix induced by one sterile neutrino can be the origin of the dominant block _ only _ in the case of normal mass hierarchy .",
    "this can explain the large ( maximal ) 2 - 3 mixing .",
    "suppose m_s = m_s = m_0 ,  m_es m_0 , [ domblock ] then @xmath60 from ( [ matrdom ] ) we obtain @xmath61 or m_s ^2 _ s = 0.5 25  mev .",
    "[ atm ]    parameters of the 1 - 2 block ( mixing and mass ) should be given by the original active mass matrix .",

    "the induced matrix can be chosen in such a way that the active one has hierarchical structure with small mixings similar to the charged fermion mass matrices .",
    "( partly this case has been studied in @xcite ) .",
    "consider non - universal active - sterile coupling of the type m_s =  ( , a , b ) ,   a ~b .",
    "then the required mass matrix of active neutrinos can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 . for @xmath76 and @xmath77",

    "certain hierarchy among those elements can be obtained for non - zero 1 - 3 mixing and some deviation of the 2 - 3 mixing from maximal .",
    "the overall spread of the values of elements by 2 orders of magnitude can be easily obtained .",
    "another scenario ( essentially considered in @xcite ) is that @xmath80 , so that the induced matrix corrects the 33 element only .",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath81 mev and the final matrix @xmath82 as in the table 1 , we obtain that the original active mass matrix should be like that for normal hierarchy ( table 1 ) but with @xmath83 mev , that is , strongly hierarchical .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the induced matrix can switch the mass hierarchy from normal to inverted and _ vice versa_. indeed , ~ - , where the induced term , @xmath84 , is close to the `` democratic '' matrix with all elements being nearly 1 .",
    "the mass matrix which generates the tri - bimaximal mixing in the normal mass hierarchy case can be presented as @xmath85 it is the sum of two singular matrices .",
    "the sub - dominant ( second ) matrix can be induced by universal mixing with the sterile component m_s = m_0 ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) .",

    "the original active neutrino masses should be very small , _",

    "if not accidental , the quark - lepton complementarity ( qlc ) relation  @xcite can imply that ( i ) there is some structure in the lepton sector which generates the bi - maximal mixing @xmath87 ; and ( ii ) there is the quark - lepton symmetry which `` propagates '' the ckm - type rotations to the lepton sector .",
    "let us consider a possibility that the induced matrix is responsible for the bi - maximal mixing : = * m_bm * = u_bm * m^diag * u_bm^t , whereas the charged lepton mass matrix produces the ckm - type rotation .",
