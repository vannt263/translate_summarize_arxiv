    "the age of globular clusters ( gcs ) has been recognized as being of key importance for deriving the age of the universe . however , up to now , determining the reliable age of gcs has been proven rather difficult .",
    "this is not only because of errors introduced by the observations , but also because of rather subjective way in which the stellar evolutionary models have been selected in some conventional procedures like the isochrone fitting and the way in which observational data has been fit . in this work ,",
    "we present a statistical approach for determining of the age of gcs that overcomes some of theses difficulties .",
    "our method avoids the difficulty in selecting the stellar evolutionary model which best matches the observational data with the stellar model of the cmd .",
    "this is done by determining the likelihood using the saha statistics or _",

    "the observational data consist of v and i photometry of three gcs of the galaxy : ngc 6397 ( dantona 1999 & king 1999 ) , m92 and m3 ( jkt data by rosenberg 1999 ) .",
    "we removed all stars with excessive photometric errors ( 3 @xmath1 in the colour ) and we selected only stars out to a radius of r@xmath2140@xmath3 for m92 and r@xmath2170@xmath3 for m3 .",
    "the number of stars in each sample is given in tab .  1 .",
    "we selected the models computed by bertelli et al .",

    "we chose them as they were published in the theoretical plane and we use the transformations computed by bruzual & charlot 2000 for convert them to the observational plane .",
