    "dislocations are fundamental defects associated with the mechanisms of plastic deformation in solids , playing also a critical role as traps and recombination centers for carriers in semiconductors . in group iv and iii - v semicondutors , under usual regimes of plastic deformation , 60@xmath0 and screw dislocations lying on [ 110 ] directions in \\{111 } slip planes are formed .",
    "experimental evidence suggests these to be dissociated into partials both at rest and in motion  @xcite .",
    "the screw dissociates into two 30@xmath0 partials and the 60@xmath0 dislocation into a 30@xmath0 partial and a 90@xmath0 partial .",
    "a central issue regards bond reconstruction at the dislocation cores , with most , if not all , of experimental and theoretical works to date indicating that reconstruction does take place .",
    "knowledge of the atomic structure of the core , and of the point - like core excitations ( kinks and solitons ) which determine the modes of dislocation motion , is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of plastic deformation at a microscopic level .    here",
    ", we review recent theoretical results leading to the proposal of a new core structure for the 90@xmath0 partial dislocation in homopolar semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "this structure has been called the double - period ( dp ) reconstruction because it involves a doubling of the period along the dislocation direction . in the following ,",
    "we discuss this and the other models of core reconstruction that had been previously considered for the 90@xmath0 partial .",
    "the traditionally accepted single - period ( sp ) reconstructed core  @xcite is compared with the dp geometry  @xcite .",
    "we also give a brief overview on the types of point excitations occurring in the two geometries .",
    "theoretical works on the atomic - structure of dislocations in semiconductors have heavily concentrated on the 90@xmath0 partial dislocation  @xcite . from the displacement field predicted for this dislocation by continuous elasticity theory , one obtains an unreconstructed configuration , with the dislocation core displaying a zigzag chain of threefold - coordinated atoms running along the dislocation direction , with broken bonds lying nearly parallel to the slip plane .",
    "mirror symmetry planes along the dislocation direction are present is this configuration , as shown in figure  [ core](a ) . by allowing relaxation of this core structure , while keeping the mirror symmetry planes ,",
    "one obtains a `` quasi - fivefold '' ( qf ) structure in which the distance between the two zigzag chains is reduced .",
    "the quasi - fivefold denomination is justified since this lead to atomic distances which do not characterize full bond reconstruction  @xcite .    the way for this system to undergo full reconstruction appears straightforward : by breaking the mirror symmetry of the unreconstructed core , reconstructed bonds are formed in the manner shown in figure  [ core](b ) .",
    "note that the lattice periodicity along the line is preserved in this geometry , hence we shall refer to this as the single - period structure .",
    "all dangling bonds have been eliminated , and all the atoms are fourfold coordinated . _",
    "ab initio _ and tight - binding calculations have predicted this structure to be substantially lower in energy ( by about 0.2 ev /  ) than the quasi - fivefold core  @xcite , being thus the one expected to occur in nature .",
    "most theoretical works on the 90@xmath0 partial have addressed the sp geometry .",
    "kinks are fully reconstructed in this structure , with low formation energies , as shown by available theoretical calculations with values ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 ev  @xcite .",
    "kinks are thus seen to introduce little strain on the core of the sp geometry .",
    "since a kink and an antikink exert an attractive elastic interaction on each other , and given the already low formation energies above , results indicating a negligible energy for a kink - antikink pair of minimum separation ( with the kink and antikink occurring in adjacent sites along the core ) should not have been very surprising .",
    "et al . _ reported an energy of only 0.004 ev for this defect , while nunes  @xcite computed a value of 0.01 ev . keating potential calculations on 96-atom supercells of the type employed in our previous works  @xcite",
    "give _ negative _ values ( @xmath10.3 ev ) for the formation energy of the defect .",
    "ldddd & & + & @xmath2 & @xmath3 & @xmath2 & @xmath3 + c + lda & @xmath4235 & 126 + tetb & @xmath4100 & 74 & @xmath476 & 14 + keating & @xmath4121 & 160 + si + lda & @xmath469 & 48 + tetb & @xmath475 & 39 & @xmath457 & 3 + keating & @xmath440 & 67 + ge + lda & @xmath458 & 27 + keating & @xmath412 & 36 +    the full implications of these latter results went unnoticed , however , until it was realized that continuing the process of inserting kink - antikink pairs in the sp core would lead to a new core structure with lower energy than the sp core itself  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the symmetry breaking already present in the sp core , this new structure involves a doubling of the periodicity along the dislocation line , and for that reason it was called the double - period ( dp ) reconstruction . the atomic geometry is shown in figure  [ core](c ) . in the original work ,",
    "the dp core was introduced for silicon , being later extended to diamond and germanium  @xcite . in this latter work , the dp core was found to be the ground - state in all three materials , as shown by the _ ab initio _ and tight - binding total energy ( tbte ) results in table  i  @xcite .",
    "recently , blase _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that the dp core is more stable in diamond over a broad range of stress states , by means of _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "examination of bond lengths and bond angles of the sp and dp structures suggest that the dp core is able to `` pack '' the atoms more efficiently , as indicated by the smaller average bond - length deviations , at the expense of larger bond - angle deviations .",
    "the balance between bond - bending and bond - stretching forces leads to the preference of the three materials for the dp core .",
    "the difference is rather subtle , though , as seen by the small differences in maximum bond - length and bond - angle deviations in the two cores , as given in table  ii  @xcite .",
    "so far , no clear experimental evidence can decide between the two structures .",
    "both geometries are fully reconstructed , hence neither gives rise to deep - gap states which would show an epr signal .",
    "it seems to be safely established by measurements that a rather small density of dangling bonds is to be expected in the core of 90@xmath0-partial dislocation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , both cores consist entirely of fivefold , sixfold , and sevenfold rings , both being consistent with images produced by transmission electron microscopy , at the current level of resolution of this technique  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental work by batson  @xcite indicates a dp - derived structure ( called the `` extended dp structure '' by this author ) to be more consistent with stem and eels experiments .",
    "kinks and two types of kink - soliton complexes . referring to figure  [ sp - def](a ) ,",
    "the reconstruction will be said to tilt to the ` left ' and to the ` right ' on the left and right sides of the kink , respectively .",
    "hence , we call this a left - right ( lr ) kink , the notation following accordingly for the other kinks . in our terminology , we call kinks the stable , fully reconstructed excitations shown in figures  [ sp - def](a ) and ( b ) , while kink - soliton complexes are those containing a three - fold coordinated atom in their center , as shown in figures  [ sp - def](c ) and  [ sp - def](d ) .",
    "being fully reconstructed , the former have low formation energies ( we obtained a value of @xmath50.12 ev in  @xcite ) , while the latter are unstable against the emission of a soliton , in reactions of the type @xmath6 , as we have previoulsy discussed  @xcite . a detailed study of the structure and energetics of these excitations is given in our previous works  @xcite .",
    "the period doubling of the dp geometry , combined with the mirror symmetry breaking common to the two structures , gives rise to an even richer structure of core excitations for the dp core .",
    "four equivalent ground states are present(``dnqu '' , `` qudn '' , `` pnbu '' , `` bupn '' in the notation of bennetto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) related to each other by ( 110 ) mirrors and by single - cell translations .",
    "an antiphase defect occurs at a translational domain boundary between core segments ; being referred to as a `` phase - switching defect '' ( psd ) [ figure  [ dp - def](a ) ] .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ dp - def](a ) , a psd can be regarded as a short segment of the sp structure inserted into the dp one .",
    "being free of dangling bonds , the psd is expected to be a low - energy structural excitation .",
    "a second class of defects results from a reversal of the mirror symmetry - breaking .",
    "these are termed `` direction - switching defects '' ( dsds ) ; they can be classified by the direction of switching , among other factors .",
    "two examples are shown in figures  [ dp - def](b ) and  [ dp - def](c ) , respectively .",
    "a dsd will necessarily contain a dangling bond or an over - coordinated atom , so the dsds are expected to have higher energies than the psds .",
    "( the malcoordinated atoms do not appear in figure  [ dp - def ] as they are located just above or below the plane of the figure . )    finally , turning to the kink structures , because there are four degenerate core structures to choose between on each side of the kink , there should be at least 16 distinct kinks .",
    "however , each of these is paired with another into which it can be converted by displacing the center of the kink by one lattice constant along the dislocation  @xcite .",
    "altogether , 8 topologically distinct families of kinks are found in this structure .",
    "furthermore , most of these families may be classified as `` kink - defect complexes '' incorporating either a dsd , or psd , or both , which may or may not be energetically bound to the kink .",
    "those including a dsd will retain a malcoordinated atom , and will have no reversal of the mirror symmetry - breaking across the kink ; those not including a dsd will be fully reconstructed and will show a reversal of the mirror symmetry - breaking .",
    "an example of the latter kind is shown in figure  [ dp - def](d ) .",
    "much work remains to be done to characterize the point excitations of the dp core .",
    "some initial results on kink formation energies were given in bennetto _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , but soliton and kink migration barriers , as well as stability of soliton - kink complexes in this geometry , are crucial aspects determining the mechanisms of dislocation motion , which remain to be addressed .",
    "the role of solitonic defects in the nucleation of kink - antikink is also an interesting possibility , to be explored in future studies .",
