    "neutron stars are objects with a very complicated , many - component and many - layered structure .",
    "the surface layer of such objects consists of an ordinary matter with atomic and molecular structure . in the inner layers of different depths , the conditions both for the rearrangement of the structural formations and for the creation of new constituents of matter are satisfied . in the central region of neutron star",
    "the density of matter reaches such high values that makes possible the appearance of various exotic particle species and phases such as hyperons , deconfined @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 quarks and @xmath5 , @xmath6 meson condensates .",
    "the existence of compact stars consisting of matter in a deconfined quark phase was predicted long ago@xcite@xcite . over the past few decades",
    "many researchers had been intensively studied various aspects related to the formation of exotic degrees of freedom in neutron stars and clarification of the observationally testing of dynamic processes , confirming the existence in the interiors of stars such constituents ( for review see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "phase transitions accompanied by discontinuities of the thermodynamic potentials are the most interesting because it leads to a dynamical rearrangement of neutron stars .",
    "depending on the value of surface tension @xmath7 , the phase transition of nuclear matter into quark matter can occur in two scenarios@xcite : either ordinary first order phase transition at constant pressure with a density jump ( maxwell construction ) , or formation of mixed hadron - quark matter with a continuous variation of pressure and density ( glendenning construction)@xcite .",
    "the question of whether the formation of a mixed phase is energetically favorable , given the finite dimensions of the quark structures inside nuclear matter , the coulomb interaction , as well as the surface energy , has been examined in refs .  .",
    "it was shown that the mixed phase is energetically favorable for small values of the surface tension between the quark matter and the nuclear matter .",
    "uncertainty of the surface tension values makes it impossible to determine the phase transition scenario which actually takes place .",
    "an important manifestation of the hadron - quark phase transition in the compact stars is a dynamical process of accretion of matter onto the surface of neutron stars with the hadron structure , which leads to fulfillment of conditions for the formation in the center of the star a new phase containing deconfined quarks .",
    "this type of transition can also occur in case of a rotating neutron star that is slowing down when the pressure in the center rises and exceeds the threshold value .",
    "the process of catastrophic rearrangement with formation of a quark core of finite radius at the star s center will be accompanied by release of a colossal amount of energy comparable to the energy release during a supernova explosion .",
    "these features of accreting neutron star near the critical configuration make it a potential candidate both for the gamma - ray bursts ( grbs)@xcite and for the gravitational wave ( gw ) emission sources@xcite .",
    "note that a similar process of both restructuring and energy release takes place also in the case of pion condensation in the cores of neutron stars@xcite@xcite .",
    "recent series of our articles@xcite@xcite were devoted to a detailed investigation of quark deconfinement phase transition of neutron star matter , when the nuclear matter is described in the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory with the scalar - isovector @xmath0-meson effective field .",
    "the calculation results of the mixed phase structure ( glendenning construction ) are compared with the results of a usual first - order phase transition ( maxwell construction ) .",
    "this article is a continuation of this series . here",
    "we aim to investigate the energy release and the change of integral parameters of compact stars due to the quark phase transition in the two alternative scenarios and to identify possible differences in the manifestations of this phenomenon .",
    "we use the eos of baym - bethe - pethick ( bbp)@xcite for description of hadronic phase in the lower density region , corresponding to the outer and inner crust of the star . in nuclear and supranuclear density region",

    ", we can calculate the physical parameters of the phase transition as in case of glendenning construction where these phases satisfy the gibbs condition , are electrically charged separately , but lead to the global electrical neutrality of the system , as well as in the case when both phases are separately neutral and transition is a usual first - order phase transition corresponding to the well - known maxwell construction .",

    "it was shown@xcite that for an ordinary first order phase transition , the density discontinuity parameter @xmath69 plays a decisive in the stability of neutron stars with arbitrarily small cores made of the denser - phase matter . here",
    "@xmath70 is coexistence pressure of two phases , and @xmath71 are the energy density of normal and superdense phases , respectively . paraphrasing the conclusions of that paper , in case of a hadron - quark first order phase transition , we get the following stability criterions : if @xmath72 , then the neutron star with an arbitrarily small core of strange quark matter is stable , and if @xmath73 , neutron stars with small quark cores are unstable . in the latter case , for a stable star there is a nonzero minimum value for the radius of the quark core .",
    "note that in the maxwell construction case of deconfinement phase transition discussed in this article the value of jump parameter is @xmath74 .",
    "using the neutron star matter eoss obtained in previous section , we have integrated the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations@xcite and obtained the gravitational mass @xmath75 , radius @xmath76 and baryonic mass @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the nucleon mass and @xmath79 the total number of baryons ) of compact stars for the different values of central pressure @xmath80 .    in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we show the @xmath81 dependence of compact stars for different quark deconfinement phase transition scenarios .",
    "open circles denote the critical configurations while solid circles denote the stable stars with minimal mass in the center of which there are deconfined quarks .",
    "moreover , in the case of maxwell construction this core is consisted of a quark - electron plasma , while in the glendenning construction case it is consisted of a mixed quark - hadron matter .",
    "we can see that in both cases of phase transition scenarios considered here there are unstable star branches between critical and minimum - mass configurations ( dot - dashed line segment ) .",
    "the fact that in the case of maxwell construction the @xmath82 relation has such a behavior is not surprising , since according to the seidov criterium@xcite the infinitesimal core of denser matter in ordinary first order phase transition is unstable when @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding eos of neutron star matter considered here satisfies this condition . with regard to the case of glendenning construction",
    ", the appearance of the unstable branch of compact stars with infinitesimal core consisting of a mixed hadron - quark matter , is not the standard case .",
    "the fact that in this scenario , the energy density is a continuous function of pressure and in most cases leads to a monotonic increase of stars mass at the lower boundary of the mixed phase , means that the configurations with an infinitesimal core of the mixed phase in many cases are stable .",
    "the case of the equation of state with a mixed phase , leading to a similar behavior of the stellar mass as a function of the central pressure was examined in the article@xcite .",
    "in contrast to our case , in this article the unstable branch of compact stars appears near the upper threshold of the mixed phase and catastrophic transition from hybrid star with a smaller core of mixed phase to the hybrid star with a large core of the mixed phase is realized . in case of glendenning construction considered here",
    "the branch of unstable compact stars appear near the lower threshold of the mixed phase . in this case",
    "the accretion of matter onto the surface of an ordinary neutron star located below the critical configuration , the baryonic mass of the star increases , the star is reached a critical configuration and the transition to the configuration with deconfined quark phase is takes place .",
    "it is worth noting that the maximum mass of stars , containing deconfined quarks is @xmath83 for the case of glendenning construction and @xmath84 for the case of maxwell construction .",
    "since the transition of ordinary neutron star to a star containing quark matter occurs at a constant baryon number , then the characteristics of the star is conveniently to represent as functions of baryonic mass @xmath85 .",
    "the binding energy @xmath86 of compact stars as a function of baryonic mass @xmath85 for maxwell and glendenning hadron - quark phase transition scenarios is shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] .",
    "accretion of matter onto the surface of the critical configuration @xmath87 will lead to a jumpwise transition to the configuration @xmath88 , having a finite - size core consisting the deconfined quark matter",
    ". this transition will be accompanied by an enormous release of energy determined by the difference in binding energies of these configurations : @xmath89    in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we plot the total energy release as a function of baryonic mass of star .",
    "one can see that in both cases of phase transition constructions the released energy increases with the increase of baryonic mass @xmath85 .",
    "for a fixed value of the baryonic mass @xmath85 of star the conversion energy in the case of glendenning construction more than in the case of maxwell construction .",
    "in addition , the minimum required baryonic mass for the catastrophic rearrangement of the neutron star and the formation of a quark core in the center of the star greater in the case of the maxwell construction compared to the glendenning construction case . in the case considered here , the quark deconfinement phase transition in the neutron star interior leads to the energy release of the order @xmath90  erg .",
    "[ f5 ] shows the changes of stellar radius @xmath91 due to the quark deconfinement phase transition as a function of baryonic mass @xmath85 of a compact star in both glendenning and maxwell construction cases .",
    "it is seen that in both cases the compact stars radii decrease .",
    "in addition , the behavior of changes @xmath92 for the two alternative scenarios are strongly distinguished .",
    "in this article we have studied the changes of the internal structure and observable characteristics of the near - critical configurations of compact stars and associated energy release due to the quark deconfinement phase transition . for description of isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter",
    "we use the rmf theory , including a scalar - isovector @xmath0-meson effective field .",
    "the quark phase is described in frame of the improved version of the mit bag model . using the obtained characteristics of hadronic and strange quark matter phases , we calculate the neutron star matter eos with quark - deconfinement phase transitions , corresponding to the maxwell and glendenning scenarios .",
    "we show that for a fixed value of the baryonic mass @xmath85 of star the conversion energy in the case of glendenning construction more than in the case of maxwell construction .",
