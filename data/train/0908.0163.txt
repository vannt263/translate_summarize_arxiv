    "the relay channel , originally proposed in @xcite , models a communication scenario where there is a relay node that can help the information transmission between the source and the destination , as shown in fig .",
    "two fundamentally different relay strategies were developed in @xcite , which , depending on whether the relay decodes the information or not , are generally known as _ decode - and - forward _ and _ compress - and - forward _ respectively .",
    "the compress - and - forward relay strategy is used when the relay can not decode the message sent by the source , but still can help by compressing and forwarding its observation to the destination .        in the compress - and - forward coding scheme developed in @xcite ,",
    "the relay first compresses its observation @xmath0 into @xmath1 , and then forwards this compressed version to the destination via @xmath2 .",
    "this compression is generally necessary since the destination may not be able to completely recover @xmath0 .",
    "instead , the compressed version @xmath1 can be recovered , as long as the following constraint is satisfied : @xmath3 then , based on @xmath1 and @xmath4 , the destination can decode the original message @xmath5 if the rate @xmath6    in this paper , we propose a modification of this compress - and - forward coding scheme by realizing that it is not necessary to recover @xmath1 since the original problem is to decode @xmath5 only ; and even if @xmath1 is to be decoded , it can be done by jointly decoding @xmath1 and @xmath5 , instead of successively decoding @xmath1 and then @xmath5 .",
    "we will show that without decoding @xmath1 , the constraint is not needed , and the achievable rate is more generally given by @xmath7 obviously , any rate satisfying - also satisfies .",
    "however , it remains a question whether there are interesting channel models where is strictly larger than - .",
    "this problem will not be addressed here .",
    "instead , we point out an immediate advantage of over - . for - , the relay needs to know the value of @xmath8 in order to decide on the appropriate compressed version @xmath1 to choose .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the channel dynamics from @xmath5 to @xmath4 , which may be difficult to obtain for the relay , e.g. , in wireless communications .",
    "however , this is not necessary for , where the relay can choose any version @xmath1 that is sufficiently close to @xmath0 , since @xmath1 is not to be decoded .",
    "what if we also want to decode @xmath1 ?",
    "it turns out that by jointly decoding @xmath1 and @xmath5 , the constraint is not necessary ; instead , we need a less strict inequality as the following : @xmath9 where , obviously , the difference from is the additional information provided by @xmath5 .",
    "formally , the single - relay channel depicted in fig . [ fig1 ] can be denoted by @xmath10 where , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the transmitter alphabets of the source and the relay respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the receiver alphabets of the destination and the relay respectively , and a collection of probability distributions @xmath15 on @xmath16 , one for each @xmath17 .",
    "the interpretation is that @xmath18 is the input to the channel from the source , @xmath19 is the output of the channel to the destination , and @xmath20 is the output received by the relay .",
    "the relay sends an input @xmath21 based on what it has received : @xmath22 where @xmath23 can be any causal function .",
    "note that a one - step time delay is assumed in to account for the signal processing time at the relay .",
    "[ th1 ] for the single - relay channel depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , by the modified compress - and - forward coding scheme , a rate @xmath24 is achievable if it satisfies @xmath25 for some @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , the compressed version @xmath1 can be decoded if @xmath27    in the modified scheme , the codebook generation and encoding process is exactly the same as that in the proof of theorem 6 of @xcite .",
    "the modification is only on the decoding process at the destination : i ) the destination finds the unique @xmath5 sequence that is jointly typical with the @xmath4 sequence received , and also with a @xmath1 sequence from the specific bin sent by the relay via @xmath2 ; ii ) if the @xmath1 sequence is to be decoded , the destination finds the unique pair of @xmath5 sequence and @xmath1 sequence from the specific bin that are jointly typical with the @xmath4 sequence received .",
    "an extension of cover / el gamal s compress - and - forward coding scheme to multiple relays was presented in @xcite .",
    "we can also extend the modified scheme to multiple relays .",
    "a multiple - relay channel is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which can be denoted by @xmath28 where , @xmath29 are the transmitter alphabets of the source and the relays respectively , @xmath30 are the receiver alphabets of the destination and the relays respectively , and a collection of probability distributions @xmath31 on @xmath32 , one for each @xmath33 .",
    "the interpretation is that @xmath18 is the input to the channel from the source , @xmath19 is the output of the channel to the destination , and @xmath34 is the output received by the @xmath35-th relay .",
    "the @xmath35-th relay sends an input @xmath36 based on what it has received : @xmath37 where @xmath38 can be any causal function .        before presenting the achievability result",
    ", we introduce some simplified notations .",
    "denote the set @xmath39 , and for any subset @xmath40 , let @xmath41 , and use similar notations for other variables .",
