    "this article is a study of the asymptotics of the wigner @xmath0-symbol from the standpoint of semiclassical mechanics , that is , essentially multidimensional wkb theory for integrable systems .",
    "the principal result itself , the leading asymptotic expression for the @xmath0-symbol , has been known since ponzano and regge ( 1968 ) .",
    "nevertheless our analysis presents several novel features .",
    "one is the exploration of lagrangian manifolds in phase space that are not tori ( the usual case for eigenstates of integrable systems ) . instead , one of the states entering into the @xmath0-symbol is supported semiclassically on a lagrangian manifold that is a nontrivial 3-torus bundle over @xmath1 .",
    "this manifold can be quantized by generalized bohr - sommerfeld rules , whereupon it yields the exact eigenvalues required by the quantum @xmath0-symbol , as well as the correct amplitude and phase of its asymptotic form .",
    "this unusual lagrangian manifold arises because the quantum state in question is an eigenstate of a set of noncommuting operators .",
    "other novel features include the expression of the asymptotic phase of the @xmath0-symbol in terms of the phases of schwinger s harmonic oscillators and the determination of stationary phase points by geometrically transparent operations on angular momentum vectors in three - dimensional space .",
    "yet another is the representation of multidimensional amplitude determinants as matrices of poisson brackets .",
    "representations of this type have been known for some time , but they are generalized here to the case of sets of noncommuting operators .",
    "the final result is a one - line derivation of the amplitude of the asymptotic form of the @xmath0-symbol .",
    "similarly brief derivations are possible for the amplitudes of the @xmath2- and @xmath3-symbols .    in addition our analysis of the @xmath0-symbol",
    "may prove to be useful for the asymptotic study of the @xmath4-symbols for higher @xmath5 .",
    "the leading order asymptotics of the @xmath2-symbol were derived by ponzano and regge ( 1968 ) , but the understanding of the asymptotics of the @xmath3-symbol is still incomplete .",
    "these symbols are important in many applications in atomic , molecular and nuclear physics , for example , the @xmath3-symbols are needed in atomic physics to convert from an @xmath6-coupled basis to a @xmath7-coupled basis .",
    "these symbols are all examples of closed spin networks , of which more elaborate examples occur in applications , each of which presents a challenge to asymptotic analysis .",
    "moreover in recent years new interest in this subject has arisen from researches into quantum computing ( marzuoli and rasetti , 2005 ) and quantum gravity , where new derivations of the asymptotics of the wigner @xmath2-symbol have been produced as well as generalizations to other groups such as the lorentz group .",
    "the @xmath4-symbols and their asymptotics have also been used recently in algorithms for molecular quantum mechanics ( de  fazio  2003 and anderson and aquilanti , 2006 ) , which exploit the connections with the theory of discrete orthogonal polynomials ( aquilanti  1995 , 2001a , b and references therein ) .",
    "the asymptotic formula for the @xmath0-symbol is closely related to that for the @xmath2-symbol , being a limiting case of the latter .",
    "these were first derived by ponzano and regge ( 1968 ) , using intuitive methods and building on wigner s earlier result for the amplitude of the @xmath2-symbol ( wigner , 1959 ) .",
    "later neville ( 1971 ) analyzed the asymptotics of the @xmath0- and @xmath2- symbols by a discrete version of wkb theory , applied to the recursion relations satisfied by those symbols , without apparently knowing of the work of ponzano and regge .",
    "his formulas are not presented in a particularly transparent or geometrical manner , but appear to reproduce some of the results of ponzano and regge .",
    "the formula for the @xmath0-symbol ( in the form of clebsch - gordan coefficients ) was later derived again by miller ( 1974 ) , who presented it as an example of his general theory of semiclassical matrix elements of integrable systems .",
    "miller called on the fact that the phase of the semiclassical matrix element is a generating function of a canonical transformation , and used the classical transformation that most obviously corresponds to the quantum addition of angular momenta to reconstruct the generating function .",
    "the method leads to a difficult integral , which , once done , yields the five terms in the phase of the asymptotic formula for the @xmath0-symbol .",
    "somewhat later schulten and gordon ( 1975a , b ) presented a rigorous derivation of the ponzano and regge results for the @xmath0- and @xmath2-symbols , using methods similar to those of neville but carrying them out in a more thorough and elegant manner .",
    "schulten and gordon also provided uniform approximations for the transition from the classical to nonclassical regimes , work that has recently been reanalyzed ( geronimo , 2004 ) and extended to non - euclidean and quantum groups ( taylor and woodward , 2005 ) .",
    "somewhat later biedenharn and louck ( 1981b ) presented a review and commentary of the results of ponzano and regge , as well as a proof based on showing that the result satisfies asymptotically a set of defining relations for the @xmath2-symbol .",
    "more recently the asymptotics of the @xmath0-symbol was derived again by reinsch and morehead ( 1999 ) , working with an integral representation constructed out of wigner s single - index sum for the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "about the same time , roberts ( 1999 ) derived the ponzano and regge results for the @xmath2-symbol , using methods of geometric quantization .",
    "finally , freidel and louapre ( 2003 ) presented a derivation of the asymptotic expression for the square of the @xmath2-symbol , based on an analysis of an @xmath8 path integral .",
    "this work was part of a larger study of generalizations of the @xmath2-symbol to other groups ( for example , the @xmath9-symbol ) that are important in quantum gravity .",
    "see also barrett and steele ( 2003 ) and baez , christensen and egan ( 2002 ) .",
    "there are many variations on the calculation of the asymptotic forms of the @xmath4-symbols that have been considered by different authors .",
    "there are asymptotic forms inside and outside the classically allowed regions ; uniform approximations connecting two or more of these regions ; asymptotic forms when only some of the quantum numbers are large and others small ; and higher order terms .",
    "ponzano and regge ( 1968 ) covered many of these issues , while reinsch and morehead computed some higher order terms .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ scwfis ] we review the semiclassical mechanics of integrable systems in the generic case that one has sets of commuting observables , drawing attention to an expression for the amplitude determinant in terms of poisson brackets . in sec .",
    "[ schwingermodel ] we review the schwinger model for representing angular momentum operators in terms of harmonic oscillators .",
    "this model allows us to express angular momentum eigenstates in terms of wave functions on @xmath10 , which we use in sec .",
    "[ 3jschwinger ] to express the @xmath0-symbols in terms of scalar products of such functions . in sec .",
    "[ cmschwinger ] we study the schwinger model from a classical standpoint , in which an important element is the reduction of the schwinger phase space ( the `` large phase space '' ) by the torus group @xmath11 , producing the poisson manifold @xmath12 ( `` angular momentum space '' ) and the reduced phase space @xmath13 ( the `` small phase space '' ) . in secs .",
    "[ jmtori ] and [ wignermanifold ] we study the two lagrangian manifolds that support the states whose scalar product is the @xmath0-symbol .",
    "one is a conventional invariant torus ( the `` @xmath14-torus '' ) , but the other , what we call the `` wigner manifold , '' is compact and lagrangian but not a torus .",
    "this manifold supports wigner s state of zero total angular momentum that enters into the definition of the @xmath0-symbols . in secs .",
    "[ intersections ] we study the intersections of the @xmath14-torus and the wigner manifold , which are the stationary phase points of the @xmath0-symbol , and show how these can be found by elementary geometrical considerations in three - dimensional space ( that is , by rotating angular momentum vectors ) .",
    "the intersection of the two manifolds turns out to be a pair of 4-tori . in sec .",
    "[ actionintegrals ] we compute the action integrals along the respective lagrangian manifolds to points on the two 4-tori , whose difference is the ponzano and regge phase of the @xmath0-symbol . in sec .",
    "[ bsquant ] we apply generalized bohr - sommerfeld quantization to the @xmath14-torus and the wigner manifold , a standard procedure for the @xmath14-torus , although it leads in an interesting way to the extra @xmath15 in the classical values representing the lengths of the angular momentum vectors .",
    "this extra @xmath15 was guessed by ponzano and regge and miller and derived systematically by schulten and gordon , reinsch and morehead and by us , although it is missing from the results of roberts . in our work",
    "it is essentially a maslov index . in sec .",
    "[ ampdet ] we generalize known expressions for the amplitude determinant of semiclassical matrix elements of integrable systems in terms of poisson brackets to the case of collections of noncommuting observables ( whose level sets nevertheless are lagrangian ) .",
    "the result allows us to compute the amplitude of the @xmath0-symbol as a @xmath16 matrix of poisson brackets .",
    "we then put all the pieces together to obtain the final asymptotic form .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we present some comments on the work , prospects for further work , and conclusions .",
    "the semiclassical mechanics of integrable systems is well understood ( einstein , 1917 ; brillouin , 1926 ; keller , 1958 ; percival , 1973 ; berry and tabor , 1976 ; gutzwiller , 1990 ; brack and bhaduri , 1997 ; cargo , 2005a , 2005b ) . here",
    "we summarize the basic facts , some of which require modification for our application .",
    "we consider the quantum mechanics of a particle moving in @xmath17 ( with wave function @xmath18 and hilbert space @xmath19 ) .",
    "we speak of an integrable system if we have a complete set of commuting observables @xmath20 acting on this hilbert space .",
    "we use hats to distinguish quantum operators from classical quantities with a similar meaning .",
    "sometimes the hamiltonian is one of these operators or a function of them , but in our application there is no hamiltonian , or , rather all the @xmath21 s are hamiltonians on an equal footing .",
    "these operators may be converted into their classical counterparts by the weyl transform ( weyl 1927 , wigner 1932 , groenewold 1946 , moyal 1949 , voros 1977 , berry 1977 , balazs and jennings 1984 , hillery  1984 , littlejohn 1986 , mcdonald 1988 , estrada  1989 , gracia - bonda and vrilly 1995 and ozorio de almeida 1998 ) .",
    "the weyl transforms ( or weyl `` symbols '' ) of these operators are functions on the classical phase space @xmath22 , that is , functions of @xmath23 .",
    "they are normally even power series in @xmath24 , as we assume , of which the leading term is the `` principal symbol . ''",
    "we denote the principal symbols of @xmath25 by @xmath26 ( without the hats ) . in view of the moyal star product representation ( moyal 1949 ) of the vanishing commutators @xmath27=0 $ ] , the principal symbols poisson commute , @xmath28 , thus defining a classically integrable system ( arnold 1989 , cushman and bates 1997 ) .",
    "( we use curly brackets @xmath29 both to denote a set and for poisson brackets . ) then according to the liouville - arnold theorem ( arnold 1989 ) , the compact level sets of @xmath26 are generically @xmath5-tori .",
    "the hamiltonian vector fields generated by the @xmath30 are commuting and linearly independent on the tori ; thus the tori are not only the level sets of the @xmath30 , they are also the orbits of the abelian group generated by the corresponding hamiltonian flows .",
    "one can define an action function @xmath31 on a torus as the integral of @xmath32 relative to some initial point ; it is multivalued because of the topologically distinct paths going from the initial to the final point , but otherwise is independent of the path .",
    "let @xmath33 be one of these tori ( @xmath30 are the functions , @xmath34 the values ) .",
    "the torus has a projection onto configuration space defining a classically allowed region in that space ; the inverse projection is multivalued .",
    "the function @xmath31 may be projected onto configuration space , defining a function we shall denote by @xmath35 ( where for brevity @xmath36 and @xmath37 stand for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , etc ) . here",
    "@xmath40 labels the branches of the inverse projection ; function @xmath41 has an additional multivaluedness due to the choice of contour connecting initial and final points on the torus .",
    "then as explained by arnold ( 1989 ) , @xmath42 is the generating function of the canonical transformation @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the set of angle variable conjugate to the conserved quantities @xmath45 .",
    "action variables may be defined in the usual way as @xmath46 around the independent basis contours on the torus ; these are functions of the @xmath30 and their conjugate variables are the angles that cover the torus once when varying between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "sometimes however it is more convenient to work with the @xmath30 instead of the actions ( the @xmath30 are not necessarily actions , and their flows are not necessarily periodic on the torus ) .",
    "tori are quantized , that is , associated with a consistent solution of the simultaneous hamiltonian - jacobi and amplitude transport equations for the operators @xmath21 , only if they satisfy the bohr - sommerfeld or ebk quantization conditions , discussed in sec .",
    "[ bsquant ] . associated with a quantized torus is a semiclassical wave function in configuration space , which in the classically allowed region is given by @xmath49\\}. \\label{scpsi}\\ ] ] the meaning of this formula is the following .",
    "first , here and below we set @xmath50 .",
    "next , given the point @xmath36 in the classically allowed region , its inverse projection onto the quantized torus is a set of points indexed by @xmath40 .",
    "we assume the projection is nonsingular at these points ( we are not at a caustic ) .",
    "the phase @xmath35 is the integral of @xmath51 from a given initial point on the torus to the @xmath40-th point of the inverse projection , and @xmath52 is the maslov index ( maslov 1981 , mishchenko  1990 , de gosson 1997 ) of the same path .",
    "the amplitude determinant @xmath53 is given by @xmath54^{-1 } , \\label{ampldet}\\ ] ] where in the second form the poisson brackets are evaluated on the @xmath40-th branch of the inverse mapping from @xmath36 to the lagrangian manifold .",
    "the amplitude determinant is a density on configuration space ( to within the semiclassical approximation , the probability density corresponding to a single branch ) , which is the projection onto configuration space of a density on the torus .",
    "the latter density is required to be invariant under the hamiltonian flows generated by the @xmath30 ( this is the meaning of the amplitude transport equations for the @xmath30 ) ; in terms of the variables @xmath55 conjugate to the @xmath30 this means that the density is constant ( it is the @xmath5-form @xmath56 ) .",
    "finally , the quantity @xmath57 in ( [ scpsi ] ) is the volume of the torus , measured with respect to this density . if the @xmath30 are action variables , then @xmath58 .",
    "the overall phase of the wave function ( its phase convention ) is determined by the choice of the initial point on the torus .",
    "now let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be two complete sets of commuting observables , with principal symbols @xmath30 and @xmath61 , conjugate angles @xmath55 and @xmath62 and action functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and let @xmath37 and @xmath65 refer to two quantized tori ( an @xmath66-torus and a @xmath67-torus ) .",
    "we assume initially that the two sets of functions @xmath30 and @xmath61 are independent .",
    "we compute @xmath68 as an integral of the wave functions over @xmath36 , evaluated by the stationary phase approximation .",
    "the stationary phase points are geometrically the intersections of the @xmath66-torus with the @xmath67-torus . generically the two tori intersect in finite set of isolated points that we index by @xmath40 , denoting the corresponding @xmath69 and @xmath70 values by @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "( for given @xmath40 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 refer to the same point in phase space . )",
    "then the result is @xmath73\\}. \\label{abmatrixelement}\\ ] ] here @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the volumes of the respective tori , as in ( [ scpsi ] ) , and the actions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are considered functions of the @xmath69 or @xmath70 coordinates on the respective tori .    as shown by littlejohn ( 1990 ) , the amplitude determinant @xmath53 can be written in terms of the poisson brackets of the observables @xmath30 and @xmath61 , @xmath78^{-1}. \\label{pbdet}\\ ] ] the maslov index @xmath52 in ( [ abmatrixelement ] ) is not the same as in ( [ scpsi ] ) .",
    "another case considered by littlejohn ( 1990 ) is the one in which some of the @xmath30 are functionally dependent on some of the @xmath61 . for this case",
    "it is convenient to assume that the first @xmath79 of the two sets of variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 are functionally independent , while the last @xmath80 are identical , so that @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    ". then the stationary phase points are still the intersections of the two @xmath5-tori , but now the intersections are generically a finite set of isolated @xmath83-tori , upon which linearly independent vector fields are the hamiltonian vector fields associated with the @xmath84 .",
    "such an @xmath83-torus is the orbit of the abelian group action generated by the corresponding hamiltonian flows . in this case",
    "we find @xmath85\\ } , \\label{abmatrixelement1}\\ ] ] where now @xmath86 is the volume of the @xmath40-th intersection ( an @xmath83-torus on which the volume measure is @xmath87 ) , and where now the amplitude determinant @xmath53 is still given by ( [ pbdet ] ) , except that it is understood that only the first @xmath79 of the @xmath66 s and @xmath67 s enter ( thus , it is an @xmath88 determinant instead of an @xmath89 one ) .",
    "the phase difference @xmath90 for branch @xmath40 can be evaluated at any point on the @xmath83-torus which is the intersection , since the integral of @xmath51 back and forth along a path lying in the intersection vanishes .",
    "the schwinger ( or @xmath8 or boson ) model for angular momenta is explained well in schwinger s original paper ( reprinted by biedenharn and van dam ( 1965 ) , the original 1952 paper being unpublished ) , and reworked in an interesting way by bargmann ( 1962 ) .",
    "for further perspective see biedenharn and louck ( 1981a ) and smorodinskii and shelepin ( 1972 ) .",
    "introductions are given by sakurai ( 1994 ) and schulman ( 1981 ) .",
    "here we define the notation for the schwinger model and emphasize some aspects that will be important for our application .    in the schwinger model each independent angular momentum vector is associated with two harmonic oscillators .",
    "we shall refer to the @xmath91- , @xmath0- , etc models , depending on how many independent angular momenta there are .",
    "the number of @xmath92 s in the model is not necessarily the number of @xmath92 s in the wigner symbol ; for example , miller ( 1974 ) used a @xmath93-model to study the clebsch - gordan coefficients , essentially the @xmath0-symbols .",
    "we start with the @xmath91-model , for which there are two harmonic oscillators indexed by greek indices @xmath94 .",
    "( these are just labels of the two oscillators ; sometimes other labels such as @xmath15 , @xmath95 are more suitable . )",
    "the wave functions are @xmath96 and the hilbert space is @xmath97 .",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath100 are @xmath101 , with @xmath102 , and energy level @xmath103 is @xmath104-fold degenerate .",
    "we introduce usual annihilation and creation operators @xmath105 , @xmath106 , omitting the hats on the @xmath37 s and @xmath107 s since these will always be understood to be operators .",
    "we define operators @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the @xmath111-th pauli matrix . here and below we use indices @xmath112 ( or @xmath113 if that is more clear ) to denote the cartesian components of a 3-vector .",

    "we discuss only the simultaneous rotation of all oscillator degrees of freedom by the same element of @xmath8 , which is generated by the total angular momentum , but partial rotation operators can also be defined and are useful .",

    "the rotational action vanishes .",

    "( [ jmaction])([phi12def ] ) .",
    "this is the phase function determined previously by ponzano and regge , miller , and others , and we see that it is essentially a simple combination of the phases of the schwinger oscillators .",
    "we have , however , determined this phase function entirely within a classical model , that is , without imposing any quantization conditions on the manifolds .",
    "we do not need bohr - sommerfeld approximations to the eigenvalues of the operators involved in the @xmath0-symbols because those eigenvalues are known exactly .",
    "we must , however , quantize the @xmath14-torus and the wigner manifold , to obtain the wave functions whose scalar product is the @xmath0-symbol .",
    "we also need the bohr - sommerfeld rules to make the connection between the contour values for various classical functions and the standard quantum numbers of the associated operators .    to quantize a lagrangian manifold we must first find the generators of the fundamental or first homotopy group of the manifold ,",
    "that is , a set of closed contours in terms of which all closed contours can be generated by concatening curves . in the following",
    "we shall call these generators `` basis contours , '' although technically the fundamental group , even when abelian , is a group and not a vector space . for example , in the familiar case of the invariant @xmath5-tori of integrable systems of @xmath5 degrees of freedom , the fundamental group is @xmath538 , that is , an arbitrary closed contour is expressed as a `` linear combination '' of the @xmath5 basis contours with integer coefficients .",
    "the @xmath5 basis contours themselves go around the torus once in the @xmath5 different directions .    after finding the basis contours ,",
    "we compute the total phase associated with each of them , the sum of an action , the integral of @xmath539 around the contour , and a maslov phase , which is @xmath540 times the maslov index of the loop . both these phases are topological invariants and are additive when loops are concatenated .",
    "then we demand that the total phase be a multiple of @xmath48 ; this is the consistency condition on the semiclassical wave function that selects out certain manifolds as being `` quantized . ''",
    "the lagrangian manifolds we are interested in are level sets of a set of classical functions that are the principal symbols of a set of operators , which in our application need not commute . quantized lagrangian manifolds support wave functions that are approximate eigenfunctions of the set of operators .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are the contour values of the principal symbols , to within errors of order @xmath541 .      in the case of the @xmath14-tori ,",
    "whose fundamental group is @xmath542 , we are dealing with the eigenfunctions of a set of independent harmonic oscillators , so the problem could not be more elementary from a semiclassical standpoint .",
    "there are , however , interesting issues that arise .",
    "let the complete set of commuting quantum observables be @xmath543 , @xmath334 , defined in ( [ irdef ] ) and ( [ jridef ] ) .",
    "let us denote the weyl symbol of an operator @xmath544 by @xmath545 .",
    "then we have @xmath546 where @xmath296 and @xmath333 ( the classical functions ) are defined by eqs .",

    "the operator @xmath547 violates our assumption in sec .",

    "our assumption is valid for the harmonic oscillators @xmath548 , but in defining @xmath549 in ( [ irdef ] ) we have subtracted the zero point energy , a constant of order @xmath24 , @xmath550 , so that the eigenvalues of @xmath549 would be the conventional quantum numbers @xmath339 for an angular momentum , and so that the identity ( [ jiidentity ] ) would have a familiar form . in the following",
    "we shall take the principal symbol of @xmath549 to be the whole symbol , including the @xmath95 .",
    "this achieves the same results we would have had if we had worked with @xmath551 instead of @xmath549 and defined the principal symbol as the leading term in @xmath24 , as in sec .",
    "[ scwfis ] , since @xmath552 .",
    "we must be careful , however , since the principal symbol of @xmath549 is not @xmath296 . for most of the other operators we shall use , the principal symbol is obtained simply by removing the hat ( for example , @xmath333 above ) .",
    "the basis contours on the @xmath14-torus are most easily expressed as the contours on which each of the angles @xmath345 is allowed to go from 0 to @xmath244 while all other @xmath345 s are held fixed .",
    "we may also use any linear combination of these contours with integer coefficients and unit determinant . in terms of the angles",
    "@xmath309 , @xmath356 , given by ( [ psiphict ] ) , a convenient choice is to take one basis contour as the path on which one @xmath309 goes from @xmath47 to @xmath244 while all others @xmath309 s and all @xmath356 s are held fixed ; this is following the @xmath296-flow for elapsed angle @xmath553 .",
    "a second basis contour may be taken to be the path on which @xmath309 goes from 0 to @xmath48 , and then @xmath356 goes from 0 to @xmath48 ; the two legs involve following the @xmath296-flow and then the @xmath333-flow , each for elapsed angle @xmath48 .",
    "doing this for @xmath334 gives us six basis contours on the @xmath14-torus .",
    "the action along the first basis contour is computed as in ( [ irmucontrib ] ) .",
    "hamilton s equations for @xmath296 are @xmath554 , so we obtain @xmath555 , where @xmath556 refers to the action along the first basis contour . for the second basis contour , the first leg contributes an action @xmath557 , while the second leg , which follows the flow generated by @xmath333 , is a rotation whose action may be computed as in ( [ rotaction ] ) , but with @xmath266 replaced by @xmath307 since we do not sum over @xmath79 .",
    "thus the final answer does not vanish ( @xmath558 is nonzero on the @xmath14-torus ) , and the contribution from the second leg is @xmath559 , or @xmath560 .",
    "altogether , we have @xmath561 where the 1 and 2 refer to the first and second basis contours associated with a particular value of @xmath79 , and where we have replaced @xmath296 and @xmath333 by their contour values @xmath339 and @xmath340 on the @xmath14-torus .",
    "next we need the maslov indices along the two basis contours . here",
    "we follow the computational method described in littlejohn and robbins ( 1987 ) , which uses the determinant of complex matrices and which is based ultimately on arnold ( 1967 ) .",
    "similar techniques are discussed by mishchenko  ( 1990 ) .",
    "the method works for finding maslov indices along closed curves on orientable lagrangian manifolds in @xmath22 . to describe the method",
    "we adopt a general notation , in which global coordinates on phase space are @xmath562 .",
    "we suppose that there exists a set of @xmath5 vector fields on the lagrangian manifold , linearly independent at each point , so that they span the lagrangian tangent plane at each point . in our applications , these are the hamiltonian vector fields associated with a set of functions @xmath45 .",
    "we consider the rate of change of the quantities @xmath563 along the @xmath92-th vector field , which is the poisson bracket @xmath564 .",
    "the set of these poisson brackets forms an @xmath565 complex matrix @xmath566 that is never singular , so @xmath567 traces out a closed loop in the complex plane without passing through the origin when we go around a closed loop on the lagrangian manifold .",
    "then the maslov index @xmath346 associated with this loop is given by @xmath568 where wn refers to the winding number of the loop in the complex plane , reckoned as positive in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "the winding number is invariant when @xmath566 is multiplied by any nonzero complex constant ( or constant matrix ) , so such constants can be dropped in the calculation .    for the @xmath14-torus , we identify the @xmath225 s and @xmath116 s with the coordinates @xmath349 and @xmath350 , and the @xmath66 s with the functions @xmath569",
    ". then we can replace @xmath570 by @xmath571 , dropping the @xmath572 .",
    "the needed matrix elements are @xmath573 we drop the constant @xmath574 on the right hand side , and choose the ordering @xmath575 for the functions",
    ". then the @xmath576 matrix block diagonalizes into three @xmath165 blocks , and we find @xmath577 to within a constant .    along the flow of one of the @xmath296 s we have @xmath578 , or @xmath579 .",
    "therefore when the given @xmath309 goes from 0 to @xmath244 , the other @xmath309 s being held fixed ( this is the first basis contour ) , @xmath567 circles the origin twice and we have @xmath580 . along the flow of one of the @xmath333 s , however , we have @xmath581 and @xmath582 , or @xmath583 . therefore along the second basis contour the @xmath296-flow takes @xmath567 once around the origin ( elapsed parameter @xmath584 ) , while the @xmath333-flow does nothing .",
    "therefore the maslov index of the second basis contour is @xmath585 .",
    "there are easier ways to find the maslov indices of harmonic oscillators , but this calculation is useful practice for the case of the wigner manifold that we take up momentarily .",
    "now we apply the quantization conditions . for the first basis contour",
    "the total phase is @xmath586 , which we set to @xmath587 where @xmath588 is an integer .",
    "thus the quantized tori must satisfy @xmath589 .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath588 are determined by the fact @xmath590 is impossible in view of the fact that @xmath296 is nonnegative definite , and @xmath591 corresponds to a torus of less than full dimensionality ( six ) , so the wave function ( [ scpsi ] ) is not meaningful .",
    "thus we must have @xmath592 .",
    "the @xmath339 in these formulas , and throughout all of the classical analysis from sec .",
    "[ cmschwinger ] up to this point , has referred to a contour value for the function @xmath296 ; the only difference now is that we are restricting the value of @xmath339 in order that the torus be quantized .",
    "this @xmath339 , however , is not value of the principal symbol of the operator @xmath549 ( see eq .",
    "( [ ijsymbols ] ) ) , so the bohr - sommerfeld or ebk quantization rule gives the semiclassical eigenvalue of @xmath549 , call it @xmath593 , as @xmath594 the semiclassical eigenvalues of @xmath549 are nonnegative integers or half - integers , the exact answer ( not surprising in view of the fact that semiclassical quantization of quadratic hamiltonians is exact ) .",
    "if we use the operator identity ( [ jiidentity ] ) to find the eigenvalues of operators @xmath595 , these are also exact .",
    "equation  ( [ jrquant ] ) shows that the classical level set corresponding to quantum number @xmath593 is @xmath596 .",
    "the extra @xmath15 in this formula has caused some discussion in the past and merits a little more now .",
    "ponzano and regge ( 1968 ) used intuition and numerical evidence to argue for the presence of the @xmath15 .",
    "miller , without knowing about ponzano and regge , also included the @xmath15 , referring to the `` usual '' semiclassical replacement for angular momenta .",
    "presumably he was referring to the similar replacement that occurs in the treatment of radial wave equations ( the langer modification , see berry and mount ( 1972 ) , morehead ( 1995 ) ) .",
    "it is not obvious to us what the langer modification has to do with the @xmath15 that occurs in the present context , nor are we aware of any general rules about when in the asymptotics of angular momentum theory it is correct to replace a classical @xmath92 by @xmath597 ( instead of @xmath598^{1/2}$ ] or something else ) .",
    "schulten and gordon ( 1975b ) and reinsch and morehead ( 1999 ) obtain the @xmath15 as a part of their proper semiclassical analyses .",
    "biedenharn and louck ( 1981b ) also speculate on the significance of the @xmath15 .",
    "roberts ( 1999 ) derivation of the asymptotics of the @xmath2-symbols does not produce the @xmath15 .",
    "he argues that in the asymptotic limit there is no confusion about whether a given point lies in the classically allowed or forbidden region , whether the @xmath15 is included or not .",
    "the omission of the @xmath15 does , however , cause an error in the phase function that is of order unity , so the oscillations are not even approximately represented ( this point was also made by biedenharn and louck , 1981b ) .",
    "we suspect that a modification of roberts method would produce the @xmath15 s . according to girelli and livine ( 2005 ) , different choices for the semiclassical replacement for the quantum number @xmath92 have been made by various researchers in the field of quantum gravity .",
    "here we have shown that the extra @xmath15 is a necessary consequence of standard semiclassical theory .",
    "we remark in addition that with the inclusion of the @xmath15 , the quantized spheres in angular momentum space are those with an area of @xmath599 , that is , they contain a number of planck cells exactly equal to the dimension of the irrep , obviously a form of geometric quantization .",
    "in particular , the @xmath368-wave @xmath600 is represented by a sphere of nonzero radius , a case for which the replacement @xmath601 is declared by biedenharn and louck ( 1981b ) to be `` clearly invalid . ''    for the second basis contour on the @xmath14-torus , the quantization condition is @xmath602 , where @xmath603 is an integer . with ( [ jrquant ] ) , this implies @xmath604 .",
    "combined with the classical restriction ( [ jmranges ] ) , this gives the usual range on magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "again the semiclassical quantization is exact . in the case of @xmath333 ,",
    "the eigenvalue of the operator is equal to the classical contour value @xmath340 on the quantized torus ( without any correction such as we see in ( [ jrquant ] ) ) .",
    "we begin the quantization of the wigner manifold by guessing the basis contours of the fundamental group by inspection of fig.[wman ] . taking the base ( initial ) point of the loops to be point @xmath37 in the figure , we get three independent basis contours ( call them @xmath605 , @xmath606 , @xmath450 ) by going around the 3-torus @xmath420 in the three different directions . a fourth contour ( call it @xmath607 )",
    "is created by following an @xmath8 rotation about some axis by angle @xmath48 , taking us along the path @xmath608 , which puts us half way around the torus @xmath420 from the starting point , and then by applying half rotations along each of the three directions on the torus , taking us down along @xmath420 in the diagram back to the starting point @xmath37 .",
    "these four contours are not independent , since @xmath609 where addition of contours means concatenation , but they are convenient for studying the quanitzation conditions since a minimal set of three contours ( not @xmath610 , but for example @xmath611 ) is less symmetrical .",
    "the fundamental group is @xmath612 .",
    "we may show the correctness of this guess by a topological argument .",
    "first , the wigner manifold is the orbit of a @xmath613 group action on the large phase space .",
    "let @xmath614 be coordinates on @xmath11 , where @xmath615 .",
    "the action of @xmath616 on the large phase space is to multiply each spinor by @xmath169 and then by @xmath303 .",
    "the isotropy subgroup of this action consists of the identity @xmath617 and the element @xmath618 , a normal subgroup isomorphic to @xmath619 .",
    "thus the wigner manifold is diffeomorphic to @xmath620 , itself a group manifold , of which the original group @xmath621 is a double cover .",
    "this cover is topologically simple since @xmath8 is simply connected ( we can go to the universal cover if we wish by replacing @xmath11 by @xmath263 ) .",
    "therefore the homotopy classes on the wigner manifold are in one - to - one correspondence with classes of topologically inequivalent curves that go from the identity in @xmath613 to one of the elements of the isotropy subgroup . since @xmath8 is simply connected , such paths are characterized by choice of the end point ( the element of the isotropy subgroup ) , and the winding numbers around the torus @xmath11 .",
    "they are thus all `` linear combinations '' of the four contours @xmath622 defined above . because of the relation ( [ homotopyrelation ] ) , however , the fundamental group is not @xmath623 , but only @xmath612 .",
    "it is easy to compute the action along these contours .",
    "contours @xmath624 , @xmath334 follow the flows of the @xmath296 s , and the action is the same as on the @xmath14-torus , namely , @xmath625 .",
    "along contour @xmath607 the spinor rotation makes no contribution to the action while the half rotation around the torus in all three angles gives the action @xmath626    as for the maslov indices , we compute the complex matrix of poisson brackets whose rows are indexed by the functions @xmath407 , and whose columns are indexed by @xmath627 . to within a multiplicative constant that we drop ,",
    "the determinant is @xmath628 the final product of determinants is interesting , since these are the @xmath8 invariants that schwinger ( biedenharn and van dam , 1965 ) used to construct the rotationally invariant state @xmath629 ( with @xmath571 replaced by @xmath146 ) .",
    "bargmann ( 1962 ) and roberts ( 1999 ) make use of the same invariants . for our purposes we need the winding number of the loop traced out in the complex plane by the product of the three determinants as we follow the four basis contours on the wigner manifold .",
    "proceeding as we did on the @xmath14-torus , we find that the maslov indices along the contours @xmath630 are 4 .",
    "for example , along the @xmath631-flow @xmath632 and @xmath633 get multiplied by @xmath634 , which causes two of the three determinants to be multiplied by the same factor , so the product gets multiplied by @xmath635 , which has winding number 2 and hence maslov index 4 when @xmath636 goes from 0 to @xmath244 .",
    "this is the same answer we found along the @xmath296-flows on the @xmath14-torus ; this was not exactly a foregone conclusion , even though the contours are the same , because the tangent planes are different .",
    "on the other hand , in both cases we find the result ( [ jrquant ] ) for the eigenvalues @xmath637 of the operators @xmath549 , which of course must not depend on how we compute them . as for contour",
    "@xmath607 the first leg , a rotation by angle @xmath48 about some axis , leaves all three @xmath165 determinants in ( [ 2zmi ] ) invariant , so the big determinant in the complex plane does not move . as for the second leg , since each @xmath309 only goes from 0 to @xmath48 we get a winding number of 1 along each @xmath296-flow , but since there are three of them the total winding number is 3 and maslov index is 6 .    combining this result with ( [ 2zaction ] )",
    ", we obtain the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition for contour @xmath607 in the form @xmath638 or , with ( [ jrquant ] ) , @xmath639 this is precisely the condition that the three quantum angular momenta must satisfy , in addition to the triangle inequalities , that they may add up to zero .",
    "it emerges in a semiclassical analysis because the wigner manifold is not quantized otherwise .    in conclusion",

    "it also allows us to identify the classical manifold ( that is , its contour values ) with a given set of quantum numbers .",
    "the generic semiclassical eigenfunction of a complete set of commuting observables is given by ( [ scpsi ] ) , with the amplitude determinant expressed in terms of poisson brackets by ( [ ampldet ] ) .",
    "these formulas apply in particular to the state @xmath640 on the left of the matrix element ( [ 3jdef ] ) , which is supported by the @xmath14-torus in the large phase space .",
    "the state on the right , @xmath641 , however , which is supported by the wigner manifold , is an eigenfunction of observables that do not commute .",
    "therefore we must rethink the derivation of eqs .",

    "( [ scpsi ] ) and ( [ ampldet ] ) , with the ( now noncommuting ) observables used in the amplitude determinant .",
    "in addition , there is a certain understanding about how the volume @xmath57 in ( [ scpsi ] ) is computed , since the angles @xmath69 conjugate to the @xmath66 s are no longer meaningful .",
    "once this is done , we must evaluate the scalar product of the two wave functions by stationary phase .",
    "if both states were eigenstates of complete sets of commuting observables , then the answer would be ( [ abmatrixelement1 ] ) with amplitude determinant ( [ pbdet ] ) , but again we must rethink the derivation of this result since the observables for one of the wave functions do not commute .",

    "the condition ( [ atwm ] ) is equivalent to @xmath674 .    to prove ( [ sigmasoln ] ) in coordinates we substitute it into ( [ atwm ] ) and expand out the derivative , obtaining an expression proportional to @xmath675 using commas for derivatives .",

    "thus ( [ intqty ] ) becomes simply @xmath680 , which vanishes since for the group in question the structure constants are completely antisymmetric .    finally to normalize the semiclassical eigenfunction supported by the wigner manifold we use the stationary phase approximation to compute the integral @xmath681\\right|^2 ,      \\label{wignorm}\\ ] ] where the sum is over branches and the branch index",
    "is suppressed .",
    "cross terms do not contribute , and when the integral is lifted to the wigner manifold it just gives the volume of that manifold with respect to the haar measure , @xmath682 where @xmath683 is given by ( [ wignervolume ] ) .",
    "now we write the @xmath0 matrix element ( [ 3jdef ] ) as @xmath684 , where @xmath685 and @xmath686 .",
    "actually this is not the most convenient form , since @xmath282 in the @xmath66-list is a function of the @xmath333 in the @xmath67-list .",

    "the linear transformation in the angles has unit determinant , so the volume of the @xmath14-torus is still given by ( [ vjm ] ) .",

    "an integral like this was evaluated by littlejohn ( 1990 ) , using the angles conjugate to the @xmath66 s and @xmath67 s , but those do not all exist in the present circumstances and we must evaluate the integral in a different way .",
    "let us write @xmath697 and @xmath698 , where @xmath699 are the four observables in common in the @xmath66- and @xmath67-lists , and where @xmath700 and @xmath701 are the two pairs of observables that are distinct .",
    "the stationary phase set of the integral ( [ abintegral ] ) consists of points @xmath36 where @xmath702 , that is , it is the projection onto configuration space of the intersection of the @xmath66-manifold and the @xmath67-manifold .",
    "that intersection , which we denote by @xmath238 , was studied in sec .",
    "[ intersections ] ( it is a 4-torus ) .",
    "it is the simultaneous level set of all of the @xmath66 s and @xmath67 s , and at the same time the orbit of the commuting hamiltonian flows generated by the @xmath323 s .",
    "its projection onto configuration space is a 4-dimensional region .",
    "we introduce a local coordinate transformation in configuration space @xmath703 where the four @xmath442 s are coordinates along the stationary phase set and the two @xmath222 s are transverse to it .",
    "we let the stationary phase set itself be specified by @xmath704 .",
    "we let @xmath705 be the momenta conjugate to @xmath706 .",
    "then the two amplitude determinants in ( [ abintegral ] ) may be combined with the jacobian of the coordinate transformation to result in the square root of the product of two determinants , one of which is @xmath707 and the other of which is the same but with the substitutions @xmath708 , @xmath709 .",
    "but since the @xmath323 s generate flows along @xmath238 , we have @xmath710 , and the lower left block of the two matrices vanishes .",

    "the @xmath222-integration gives @xmath714 the determinant in this result must be multiplied by the determinants of the matrices ( [ zdzepbs ] ) to get the overall determinant in the denominator after the @xmath222-integration .",
    "the product of these three determinants is the determinant of the matrix @xmath715      \\left(\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial v}\\right)^t ,      \\label{3matrixprod}\\ ] ] where it is understood that a partial derivative stands for a matrix whose row index is given by the numerator and column index by the denominator , unless the matrix transpose or inverse is indicated , in which case the rule is reversed .",

    "in the two middle matrices in ( [ 3matrixprod ] ) , the variables held fixed amount to differentiating @xmath716 with respect to @xmath222 along the @xmath66- and @xmath67-manifolds , respectively , since @xmath717 and @xmath718 .",
    "notice that these two matrices are symmetric .",
    "now we express the two matrices in the middle of ( [ 3matrixprod ] ) purely in terms of partial derivatives computed in the canonical @xmath712 coordinates .",
    "we do this by writing out the jacobian matrix @xmath719 and the inverse jacobian @xmath720 , multiplying the two together to obtain a series of identities connecting the forward and inverse jacobian blocks , and then solving for the inverse jacobian blocks in terms of the forward ones .",

    "the integral ( [ abintegral ] ) becomes @xmath732 where the branch sum runs over all branches of the projection of @xmath238 onto configuration space as well as the two disconnected components of @xmath238 ( the two 4-tori discussed in sec .",

    "we have also dropped an overall phase , and we are not attempting to compute the maslov indices in detail . the amplitude determinant has been reduced to a @xmath16 matrix of poisson brackets of the observables in the @xmath66- and @xmath67-lists that differ , exactly as in ( [ pbdet ] ) . calculating this matrix explicitly , we find @xmath735      & = |j_{x1 } j_{y2 } - j_{x2 }",

    "this quantity is invariant under rotations about the @xmath222-axis , that is , it poisson commutes with @xmath282 .",
    "it also poisson commutes with the other three variables in the @xmath323-list , @xmath737 , and so is constant on the intersection @xmath238 and can be taken out of the @xmath442-integral .",
    "the same applies to the phase factor , since @xmath733 is also constant on the @xmath238-manifold .",
    "then the @xmath442-integral can be done , since @xmath738 is just the jacobian connecting @xmath442 with the angle variables conjugate to @xmath739 , denoted above by @xmath479 .",
    "thus the @xmath442-integral just gives the volume @xmath740 of the intersection @xmath238 with respect to these angles , see ( [ videf ] ) .",
    "in fact , had the variables @xmath323 not been commuting , but if they had formed a lie algebra , then @xmath740 would be the volume of @xmath238 with respect to the haar measure of the corresponding group .",
    "this circumstance arises , for example , in a similar treatment of the @xmath2-symbol .    as a result of these rather lengthy manipulations of amplitude determinants ,",
    "we obtain the final , simple result , @xmath741 where the branches now run over just the two disconnected pieces of the intersection @xmath238 .",
    "this is a version of ( [ abmatrixelement1 ] ) , with the right understanding of the volume measures , generalized to the case at hand in which the observables do not commute .",
    "the actual calculation of the final amplitude determinant takes just one line , eq .",
    "( [ 3jampldet ] ) .",
    "in fact , for our application the volume @xmath740 and the remaining amplitude determinant are the same for both branches and can be taken out of the sum .",
    "the relative maslov index between the two branches is 1 ; we will not belabor this point since the answer is already known .",
    "we simply note that by splitting the maslov phase @xmath742 between the two branches and subsitituting @xmath743 , @xmath744 , we obtain to within an overall phase the result of ponzano and regge , @xmath745",
    "in many ways the @xmath0-symbol is not as interesting as the @xmath2-symbol , of which it is a limiting case .",
    "we intended our work on the @xmath0-symbol as a warm - up exercise , expecting a routine application of semiclassical methods for integrable systems .",
    "the nongeneric lagrangian ( wigner ) manifold was a surprise .",
    "similar nongeneric lagrangian manifolds occur also in the semiclassical analysis of the @xmath2- and @xmath3-symbols .",
    "if all one wants is a derivation of an asymptotic formula , then there are many ways to proceed .",
    "for example , one can simply take the expression for the symbol due to wigner ( @xmath0 ) or racah ( @xmath2 ) as a sum over a single index , and apply standard asymptotic methods ( stirling s approximation , poisson sum rule , etc ) .",
    "but if one wants a derivation that reveals the geometrical meaning of the classical objects that emerge ( the triangle , the tetrahedron , etc ) , then an approach such as ours may be preferable .",
    "our approach is more geometrical than earlier ones , and in that respect is closer in spirit to the work of roberts ( 1999 ) , freidel and louapre ( 2003 ) and later authors .",
    "it is likely that at some deeper level all these methods are the same , although superficially we see only a little similarity between our work and these others .",
    "one may also desire a method that makes the symmetries of the symbol manifest .",
    "our analysis does not do this for the @xmath0-symbol , but those symmetries are not manifest in wigner s definition of the @xmath0-symbol that we employ as our starting point , either . to bring the symmetries out",
    "it seems necessary to employ some construction related to schwinger s generating functions , which involve lifting the definitions into higher dimensional spaces .",
    "our method of calculating amplitude determinants in terms of poisson brackets may have computational advantages in other applications , as well .",
    "the method can be remarkably easy to use .",
    "for example , the @xmath2-symbol can be defined as a matrix element , @xmath746 which is the unitary matrix in @xmath747 defining a change of basis in the subspace in which four angular momenta of given lengths add up to zero ( @xmath200 means @xmath748 ) . in this case",
    "there are eight observables on each side of the matrix element , of which seven are common and one is different .",
    "thus the amplitude of the @xmath2-symbol is the inverse square root of the single poisson bracket , @xmath749 as follows immediately from ( [ njliepoisson ] ) .",
    "one sees immediately that it is proportional to the volume of the tetrahedron .",
    "a similarly easy calculation is possible for the @xmath3-symbol .",
    "it is harder , however , to express these amplitudes in terms of the quantum numbers ( the magnitudes @xmath339 ) , that is , to translate these magnitudes into vectors @xmath307 that lie on the stationary phase set .",
