    "the second section contains an introduction to lefschetz fibrations and motivation for the material of this paper , but we collect the main results here . recall that all integral symplectic 4manifolds admit lefschetz fibrations which in turn are equivalent to isotopy classes of maps from a 2sphere to the moduli space of stable curves @xmath0 ( satisfying appropriate conditions ) .",
    "once the genus is sufficiently large the isotopy class of the sphere becomes a symplectic invariant of the 4manifold .",
    "if the 4manifold is khler and the lefschetz fibration is holomorphic the rational curve in @xmath0 is a khler subvariety and in particular the weil - petersson form @xmath1 is positive on the sphere .    for any symplectic lefschetz fibration @xmath2 inducing @xmath3 we have @xmath4 , [ \\phi_f({\\mathbb{s}}^2 ) ] \\rangle > 0 $ ] .",
    "the statement has geometric content ; the cohomological conditions on the sphere @xmath5 do not alone imply the result .",
    "the result is a consequence of the following more general result which extracts topological information on the 4manifold from the geometry of the sphere in moduli space .",
    "[ maintheorem ] with the notation as above , the signature of @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 \\rangle - \\delta\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes the hodge bundle and @xmath9 is the number of critical fibres of the fibration .",
    "a sketch of the proof can be found at the end of section two .",
    "this formula is a generalisation of one due to atiyah for smooth fibrations , and related work by meyer , wolpert and others is well known though in the sequel we shall usually leave the modifications to the reader . ] . in the algebraic case",
    "the theorem follows from standard chern class equalities ; nonetheless i have not seen the particular formula either applied or appear in the literature ; and the extension to general symplectic fibrations ( whilst unsurprising ) seems new .",
    "the signature theorem has various implications for the geometry of lefschetz fibrations :    * there are no lefschetz fibrations with monodromy group contained in the torelli group .",
    "* let @xmath10 be a genus two fibration with @xmath11 non - separating vanishing cycles and no others .",
    "then @xmath6 is naturally a double cover of @xmath12 , where @xmath12 denotes @xmath13 if @xmath14 is even and the non - trivial sphere bundle over the sphere if @xmath14 is odd .",
    "after earlier drafts of this work were distributed alternative proofs of the first corollary due to li and stipcisz also appeared .",
    "the author s proof also forms an appendix to a preprint of amoros , bogomolov , katzarkov and pantev @xcite who formulated the statement as a conjecture .",
    "the existence of the double covers in the second corollary has been obtained , by different methods , by numerous authors but the identification of the base of the cover in terms of @xmath14 seems to have gone unnoticed .",
    "( the more general statement including reducible fibres is given in the text .",
    "we also give the classification of complex genus two lefschetz fibrations without reducible fibres ( [ classify ] ) ; this result , due to chakiris , was rediscovered independently by the author , and to the best of his knowledge there is no published proof . )    * * acknowledgements**the material presented here is taken from @xcite ; i am grateful to my supervisor simon donaldson for conversations on these and related topics",
    ". versions of most of this work have circulated informally and i apologise for the delays and duplications in its independent appearance .",
    "we begin with a lightning review of the concepts underlying the rest of the paper ; a more leisurely tour of this material is taken in @xcite amongst other sources .",
    "recall that a lefschetz fibration of a smooth 4manifold @xmath6 comprises a surjection to @xmath15 , a submersion on the complement of finitely many points @xmath16 in distinct fibres , at which there are local complex coordinates ( compatible with fixed global orientations on @xmath6 and @xmath15 ) with respect to which the map takes the form @xmath17 .",
    "we always assume that the fibres contain no @xmath18spheres ( `` relative minimality '' ) so in particular the fibre genus is always strictly positive . the existence of a lefschetz fibration guarantees that @xmath6 is a symplectic 4manifold , whose topology is determined by a monodromy homomorphism @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the mapping class group of a closed oriented genus @xmath21 surface . the map @xmath22 maps the generators of the fundamental group which encircle a single critical point once in an anticlockwise fashion to positive dehn twists in the mapping class group .",
    "these dehn twists are about _ vanishing cycles _ ; real circles in a fixed fibre which shrink along some given paths to the nodal points of the singular fibres .",
    "thus the topology is completely encoded in an algebraic piece of data which is a word in such twists in the mapping class group , called a _",
    "positive relation_. we shall often refer to the values @xmath23which are the critical values of @xmath24by the set @xmath25 . the intrinsic symplectic form takes the shape @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a closed form which is symplectic on the smooth fibres , and @xmath28 is symplectic on the base @xmath29 .",
    "the form is symplectic for sufficiently large @xmath30 , and this `` inflation '' of the horizontal directions ensures that any local section ( and hence multisection ) of the fibration with suitable orientation can be made symplectic .",
    "the importance of the concept for us comes from    ( donaldson)let @xmath31 be a symplectic 4manifold for which @xmath32 is the lift of an integral class @xmath33 $ ] . for sufficiently large integers @xmath34 the blow - up @xmath35 of @xmath6 at @xmath36 ^ 2 $ ] distinct points admits a lefschetz fibration over @xmath15 ; each connected fibre , pushed back down to @xmath6 , is poincar dual to @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "the resulting lefschetz fibration will be relatively minimal .",
    "we can always choose a compatible almost complex structure on @xmath35 such that    * the projection map to @xmath15 is pseudoholomorphic ; * the structure is integrable in a sufficiently small tubular neighbourhood of each singular fibre .",
    "note that the exceptional sections are symplectic submanifolds of the blow - up @xmath35 .",
    "the fibres of the fibration `` downstairs '' in @xmath6 before blowing - up form a _ lefschetz pencil _ with finitely many _",
    "base points_. once we have constructed a lefschetz fibration on a symplectic manifold there is a natural symplectic form already given to us , without the existence result mentioned in the topological context above ; the given form and the constructible form are deformation equivalent .",
    "note that the canonical class of a symplectic manifold  which is uniquely defined  is independent of scalings of the symplectic form .",
    "the choice of compatible almost complex structures or metrics with a fixed symplectic form on @xmath35 is contractible .",
    "given one such choice , the smooth fibres of the fibration become metric , hence conformal and complex manifolds , that is riemann surfaces of genus @xmath21 .",
    "we therefore induce a map @xmath38 of a punctured sphere into the moduli space of curves . by the hypotheses of good local complex models , the singular fibres of the lefschetz fibration are naturally stable curves ( with a unique node in each ) and the map completes to a map of the closed sphere into the deligne ",
    "mumford stable compactified moduli space @xmath0 .",
    "this map is then defined up to isotopy independent of the choice of metric or almost complex structure .",
    "the singular fibres correspond to the intersections of the sphere with the compactification divisor , and fall into two classes : irreducible fibres , where we collapse a non - separating cycle in the riemann surface , and reducible fibres given by the one - point union of smooth riemann surfaces of smaller genera .",
    "we shall see that the two kinds of singular fibre often play a somewhat different role in the sequel ; each kind is counted by the intersection number of the sphere @xmath39 with the relevant components of the compactification divisor .",
    "note also that the following four stipulations are geometrically equivalent :    * the local complex coordinates at the @xmath40 all match with fixed global orientations ; * the monodromy homomorphism @xmath22 takes each of the obvious generators of the free group @xmath41 to a standard _ positive _ dehn twist ; * the intersections of the sphere @xmath42 with the compactification divisor of stable curves are all locally positive ; * there is a symplectic structure on the total space @xmath35 which restricts on each smooth fibre to a symplectic form .    note that from the point of view of the moduli space of curves , holomorphic spheres in @xmath0 correspond to khler lefschetz fibrations whilst smooth spheres give rise to more general symplectic 4manifolds .",
    "one can make sense of lefschetz fibrations over an arbitrary base curve @xmath43 and _ mutatis mutandis _ all the above comments apply .",
    "a natural question to ask is how the algebraic topology of a 4manifold is encoded in a lefschetz description .",
    "by van kampen s theorem it is easy to see that once a set of paths and vanishing cycles are chosen , the fundamental group of @xmath6 is just the quotient of @xmath44 by the classes generated by the vanishing cycles .",
    "this in turn gives the same description for the first homology group .",
    "in fact all the homology groups of @xmath6 are given by a pretty ( short ) chain complex essentially due to lefschetz and presented in modern notation in @xcite ( see in particular mumford s appendix to chapter vi ) .",
    "to recall this , fix a set of paths in the base of the fibration and associated vanishing cycles @xmath45 .",
    "we have @xmath46 for @xmath47 a fixed smooth fibre and @xmath48 .",
    "we define the picard ",
    "lefschetz twist map @xmath49 by @xmath50 this is the effect of the dehn twist about the cycle @xmath51 on the homology of the fibre @xmath52 , and @xmath53 denotes the intersection product . because the composite of the monodromies in a lefschetz fibration around a loop encircling all the critical values is trivial , we have the relation    [ definer ] t_r t_r-1 t_1  =  .    the maps in the sequence are defined by @xmath54 @xmath55 the relation ( [ definer ] ) ensures that the composite @xmath56 is zero and hence the sequence does indeed give a complex .",
    "the cokernel of @xmath57 is precisely the first homology group from the remarks above .",
    "moreover the middle homology of the complex gives the group @xmath58 , [ { \\mathrm{section } } ] \\rangle$ ] .",
    "to see this , note that any element of @xmath59 in the complement of the subspace spanned by fibres and sections projects to some graph in the base @xmath60 whose endpoints are all critical values of the fibration ; such an element is closed if and only if it arises from a union of vanishing discs bounding some homologically trivial cell in a fibre .",
    "thus @xmath61 is indeed a quotient of @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , every 3cell on @xmath6 defines on intersection with the fibres a 1cell , and hence the third homology of @xmath6 can be computed by sweeping 1cycles in fibres around the manifold via the monodromy maps .",
    "it follows  again recalling the relations given by ( [ definer])both that the relations in @xmath61 are given by the image of @xmath63 whilst the group @xmath64 computes @xmath65 .",
    "thus the word in vanishing cycles leads to an easy computation of the homology  both betti numbers and torsion  for the manifold @xmath6 .    following this success , we ask for an expression for the signature of @xmath6 .",
    "this is less straightforward . in principle",
    "one can compute the intersection matrix from the vanishing cycles via the sequence above , but the formulae are highly unmanageable .",
    "ozbagci @xcite has shown that using wall s non - additivity formula  a souped up version of the novikov additivity which gives the signature of a 4manifold in terms of signatures of pieces resulting from cutting along a three - manifold ",
    "one can find an algorithm for computing signature from a word in vanishing cycles which can be fed to a computer .",
    "in this note we present a different formula which has the advantage of being elegant and in closed form but which has the disadvantage of starting not from a word in vanishing cycles but from a sphere in the moduli space @xmath0 .",
    "nonetheless we shall see that the formula readily lends itself to certain applications to the topology and geometry of lefschetz fibrations . before giving the proof it will be helpful to assemble some facts on signature cocycles and on the moduli space of curves .",
    "the natural order in which to recall these does not really suit the proof of ( [ maintheorem ] ) and for the reader s convenience we give here the skeleton of the argument .",
    "* a sketch of the proof *    1 .   as with the mayer ",
    "vietoris sequence in homology , signature can be computed from the pieces of a decomposition of a manifold ; we will cut a lefschetz fibration into its smooth part and neighbourhoods of critical fibres .",
    "2 .   by the index theorem for manifolds with boundary",
    ", the signature of the smooth part can be expressed in terms of @xmath66invariants of the boundary fibrations and the first chern class of a determinant line bundle down the fibres .",
    "( this is precisely the hodge bundle . )",
    "the determinant line bundle and @xmath66invariant terms can be identified with a relative first chern class of a topological line bundle defined by a signature cocycle in the group cohomology of the symplectic group .",
    "thus the signature of the smooth part of the fibration is computed by a symmetric function on the symplectic group whose arguments are the monodromies around the boundary circles .",
    "4 .   by naturality properties of the cocycle and",
    "the above , the difference between evaluating the first chern class of the hodge bundle on a surface in @xmath0 and the relative first chern class on a surface with boundary in @xmath67 is entirely determined by the conjugacy classes of the monodromies in @xmath68 ; since these are all equal for a lefschetz fibration , the discrepancy is measured by a single integer for each genus .",
    "this integer is fixed by determining the theorem for at least one fibration at every genus ; a riemann  roch theorem gives the theorem for all projective fibrations , completing the proof .",
    "much of the material here is drawn from atiyah s pretty discussion in @xcite .",
    "we start with novikov s additivity formula , which states that if we decompose a 4manifold @xmath69 along an embedded 3manifold @xmath70 , then @xmath71 where the left hand side denotes the signature of @xmath6 and for a manifold with boundary @xmath72 the relative signature @xmath73 denotes the difference between the number of positive and negative eigenvalues on the intersection form in the middle cohomology of @xmath74 ( but this form is no longer non - degenerate ) .",
    "alternatively , on the image of the relative cohomology @xmath75 the intersection form is non - degenerate and we take the signature of the form restricted to this subspace .",
    "let @xmath76 be a lefschetz fibration .",
    "if we decompose @xmath6 into tubular neighbourhoods of the various singular fibres and a swiss cheese then by novikov additivity we write the signature as the signature of the fibration over @xmath77 corrected by the sums of the local signatures .",
    "an easy computation , noting that the total space of such a tube retracts to the singular fibre , gives that    * @xmath78 for a neighbourhood of a reducible singular fibre ( separating vanishing cycle ) * @xmath79 for a neighbourhood of an irreducible singular fibre ( non - separating vanishing cycle ) .",
    "thus we know @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the number of separating vanishing cycles and @xmath82 is the preimage @xmath83 , @xmath84 a neighbourhood of the set of critical values",
    ". following @xcite it is now natural to introduce the notation @xmath85 for the signature of the 4manifold @xmath74 which is a fibration by genus @xmath21 curves over a sphere with @xmath86 ordered open discs deleted , and for which the monodromies around the first @xmath87 boundary circles are given by elements @xmath88 .",
    "it follows of course that the monodromy about the last boundary circle is just the inverse of the ordered product of these matrices , for the fundamental group of the base is free .",
    "write @xmath89 .",
    "the topology of @xmath74 is determined by a representation @xmath90 which may be composed with the standard representation @xmath91 ; this gives a flat vector bundle @xmath92 over @xmath93 with fibre the first complex cohomology of the fibre . on this vector bundle",
    "there is a non - degenerate skew - symmetric form given by the cup - product @xmath94 on @xmath95 . combining this skew form with the cup - product on classes from the base we obtain an indefinite hermitian structure on the single vector space @xmath96 given by the cohomology with local coefficients in @xmath92 .",
    "@xcitethe signature @xmath97 of @xmath74 is the signature of the hermitian form defined above on the cohomology group with local coefficients @xmath98 .",
    "the proof amounts to a careful application of the leray - serre spectral sequence for a fibration .",
    "that only the homologically non - trivial monodromies enter is unsurprising ; signature after all is a homological invariant .",
    "it follows that the signature of a lefschetz fibration is completely determined by the number of separating vanishing cycles @xmath81 and the value of the function @xmath99 where the @xmath100 can now be taken to be the symplectic matrices corresponding to the monodromies about homologically essential vanishing cycles .",
    "applying the novikov property to this symmetric function on the symplectic group gives the following critical relation : @xmath101 and hence , splitting the sphere with four holes in two distinct ways , @xmath102 this last formula is exactly the _",
    "2cocycle _ condition in group cohomology , and it follows that we have defined an element @xmath103 \\in h^2 ( sp_{2g}({\\mathbb{r } } ) ; { \\mathbb{z}}))$ ] .",
    "such group cohomology elements correspond ( cf lemma ( [ perfect ] ) ) to central extensions of the group by the integers and we have an associated sequence @xmath104 moreover again by standard properties of group cohomology @xcite there is a section to the last map @xmath105 with the properties that    * the product @xmath106 gives a well - defined element of the central factor @xmath107 for any @xmath108 , * @xmath109 for any @xmath108 .",
    "the central point is that this section @xmath110 has an interpretation in terms of a line bundle .",
    "recall that the cohomology groups down the fibres of @xmath111 formed a flat vector bundle @xmath92 with a symplectic structure . if we complexify @xmath92 then the form @xmath112 is hermitian of type @xmath113 and we can choose a splitting @xmath114 into maximal positive definite and negative definite subspaces . such splittings correspond to reducing the structure group of @xmath115 from @xmath116 to @xmath117 ; the quotient homogeneous space is contractible so such splittings necessarily exist and are unique up to homotopy .",
    "[ number1]@xcitelet @xmath118 be the line bundle @xmath119 .",
    "the section @xmath110 defines a homotopy class of trivialisations of @xmath120 over any loop @xmath121 and hence a relative first chern class @xmath122 . then working over a sphere with three discs deleted @xmath123 for any @xmath124 .",
    "since we have novikov additivity for @xmath99 and relative chern classes behave well with respect to connected sums , it follows that for any fibration @xmath111 we have    [ identity ] ( z , z )  =  ( \\ { a_i } )  =  c_1 ( l^2 ; c^ ) .    therefore to understand the signature of a lefschetz fibration we need",
    "only understand this relative first chern class and its trivialisation over loops as defined by @xmath110 . before turning to this we recall one well known observation which is relevant both above and in the sequel . the section @xmath110 is in fact unique , since the difference between any two choices would give a homomorphism from the group @xmath125 to the integers .",
    "but no such homomorphisms can exist ; for there is a canonical homomorphism from the mapping class group @xmath20 onto @xmath125 and    [ perfect ] the mapping class group @xmath20 is perfect for @xmath126 and has finite cyclic abelianisation for @xmath127 .",
    "this result is well known ; @xmath128 whilst @xmath129 .",
    "for @xmath126 the usual proof simply writes a generating dehn twist as an explicit product of commutators .",
    "more in line with our thinking is the following geometric sketch .",
    "it was shown by wolpert @xcite that for genus @xmath126 the second cohomology of the moduli space of stable curves is generated by a khler class and the divisors given by the components of the compactifying locus of stable curves . by poincar duality",
    "it follows that there are homology elements @xmath130 $ ] which have algebraic intersection @xmath131 with the @xmath132-th component of the compactification divisor and @xmath133 with all others .",
    "we can represent these classes by embedded surfaces ; since the moduli space is of high dimension ( and the orbifold loci of high codimension ) we can tube away excess intersections , at the cost of increasing genus , and even find representing surfaces @xmath134 with geometric intersection numbers with the stable divisor the same as the algebraic intersection numbers .",
    "but the fundamental group of a surface of genus @xmath21 with one boundary circle admits the presentation @xmath135 = \\partial \\rangle.\\ ] ] thus in the fibration of curves over the surface @xmath134 defined by the universal property of the moduli space , the monodromy about the unique singular fibre  a standard positive dehn twist  is expressed as a product of commutators .",
    "since we can do this for any isotopy class of dehn twist the result follows .",
    "to warm up we will treat the case of a projective fibration @xmath136 and introduce some of the objects that appear in the final statement of the main theorem .",
    "( in fact the proof of ( [ maintheorem ] ) will not crucially rely on a separate treatment for the projective case but some aspects are simplified by giving such an argument , and it gives some structure to the theory of the hodge bundle we want to quote . )",

    "thus as a topological bundle the determinant line bundle is isomorphic to the bundle given by taking only the zero - eigenvalue spaces ( of harmonic forms in @xmath202 in our case ) :    [ number2 ] _  _  ( h^- ) ( h^+)^-1 .",
    "the line bundle @xmath211 is topologically the dual of the line bundle @xmath214 defined from the signature cocycle .",
    "moreover the trivialisations of @xmath215 and @xmath216 ( defined by @xmath66invariants and @xmath110 respectively ) coincide .    that the line bundles are dual amounts to an identification of the positive and negative harmonic forms of @xmath217 with the positive and negative eigenspaces for the hermitian form @xmath218 ; then compare the formulae defining @xmath118 in ( [ number1 ] ) and ( [ number2 ] ) .",
    "but by definition the @xmath202 are defined to be eigenspaces for an operator whose index is signature and the @xmath219 comprising @xmath118 are the definite subspaces for the hermitian form arising from the symplectic signature pairing . that the trivialisations agree is a consequence of the lemma ( [ perfect ] ) . for",
    "if the two trivialisations differed then their difference would define a map from the set of components of the boundary @xmath212 to @xmath107 depending only on the particular monodromies associated to these components .",
    "moreover since we know that there are identities ( [ identity ] , [ secondtime ] ) for all fibrations @xmath111 we always know that @xmath220 since the values of the trivialisations on loops depend only and naturally on the monodromies , this difference map defines @xmath221 which ( taking the above relation for @xmath93 a sphere with three discs removed ) is a homomorphism . but by ( [ perfect ] ) we know the mapping class groups admit no such non - trivial homomorphisms .    assembling our various identifications we have proven @xmath222 \\rangle\\ ] ] where we interpret the right hand side with respect to the @xmath66trivialisation still ( and recall @xmath81 is the number of separating vanishing cycles ) . to produce the final formula ( [ maintheorem ] ) we now need to understand the exact nature of the holonomy term for one of the dehn twist monodromies in a lefschetz fibration .",
    "atiyah gives the precise formula which shows the sense in which the @xmath66invariant gives a canonical logarithm for the holonomy of the quillen connexion : @xmath223 here in the final term , which is an integer , @xmath224 is the `` topological determinant bundle '' @xmath225 .",
    "the monodromy denotes the particular element of @xmath68 corresponding to the fibration over a given boundary circle , and @xmath226 denotes a choice of logarithm for this monodromy given by the explicit signature cocycle we began with .",
    "the final answer can therefore be given by a direct computation with this cocycle .",
    "more simply , given the work at the start of the section and the naturality properties of the signature of manifolds ( and hence the cocycle ) , we know that the answer depends only on the conjugacy class of the monodromy in the mapping class group . since all our monodromies are positive dehn twists about non - separating vanishing cycles , we are interested in a single integer for each genus @xmath21 .",
    "this is then determined by the computation of the signature for a single lefschetz fibration with genus @xmath21 fibres .",
    "but we already know the answer for projective fibrations : writing @xmath227 for the number of non - separating vanishing cycles , @xmath228 \\rangle\\ ] ] which is just as we require .    note that from this point of view the singular fibres enter the formula from naturally different perspectives ; the separating ones because they affect @xmath229 and invoke a local contribution to signature , the non - separating ones because they affect @xmath230 and hence the global monodromy which detects the extent to which the manifold is not homologically a product .",
    "in the last sections we give some applications of the signature formula and digress into some of the topics we encounter .",
    "the moduli space of genus two curves is in fact globally _ affine _ , and the ample divisor given by @xmath231 , for @xmath32 the dualising sheaf of the universal curve , is empty on @xmath232 and a linear combination of boundary divisors on the compactification .",
    "mumford @xcite has calculated precisely that at genus two @xmath233 where @xmath234 are respectively the irreducible components of @xmath235 corresponding to curves which are generically irreducible or a union of two elliptic curves respectively . from the signature formula",
    ", we therefore see that the signature for a genus two lefschetz fibration is determined completely by the numbers of non - separating and separating vanishing cycles @xmath227 and @xmath81 :    [ fracsign ] ( x )  =  - n - s.    this `` fractional signature formula '' was first established by matsumoto @xcite by related but different means .",
    "we can now compare the two different formulae for signatures of genus two fibrations to some effect . recall that @xmath236 and hence for any genus two fibration we have @xmath237 .",
    "let @xmath238 be a genus two lefschetz fibration with @xmath239 .",
    "write @xmath12 for the product @xmath240 if @xmath14 is even and for the non - trivial sphere bundle over the sphere if @xmath14 is odd",
    ". then @xmath241 the blow - up of @xmath6 at @xmath81 points admits a smooth double cover over the blow - up of the relevant sphere bundle over a sphere at @xmath242 points , ramified over a smooth surface @xmath143 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath6 is given by blowing down @xmath18spheres in the fibres of a fibration arising from double covering a non - minimal rational surface over a curve @xmath143 which is the canonical resolution of singularities of a curve @xmath243 containing @xmath81 infinitely close triple points .",
    "( such a point is given by the singularity at the origin of @xmath244 ; the curve has @xmath245 sheets meeting mutually tangentially at this point , and the sheets are separated by two successive blow - ups . )",
    "thus if @xmath6 has no reducible fibres then it has @xmath246 singular fibres for some @xmath14 , and @xmath6 double covers the sphere bundle with `` parity '' the same as the parity of @xmath14 , branched over a smooth two - dimensional surface @xmath143 . as a piece of notation ,",
    "recall that @xmath247 denotes the unique complex ( or symplectic ) ruled surface with symplectic sections of self - intersection @xmath248 ; moreover all projective bundles over @xmath15 are the projectivisations of ( not uniquely determined ) vector bundles .",
    "the proof of the proposition is reasonably straightforward and versions due to fuller @xcite and siebert ",
    "tian @xcite have now appeared ( an independent proof was given in @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is simple ; on choosing a metric all the smooth fibres are hyperelliptic riemann surfaces and admit natural double branched covers over spheres",
    ". these can be patched together smoothly except near separating singular fibres .",
    "the point is that the map fibrewise is given by sections of the canonical bundle on the fibre , and the nodal points in reducible fibres are base points of the canonical system on a stable curve ; for smooth or stable irreducible curves the canonical linear system has no base points and the branch locus varies smoothly .",
    "near reducible fibres we can assume the complex structure is integrable and graft in a local holomorphic model .    this argument ( and those of fuller and siebert ",
    "tian ) gives the base of the double cover the structure of a sphere bundle over the sphere but does not identify it beyond that .",
    "the signature formulae allow one to do precisely this .",
    "the ruled surface @xmath249 for suitable rank two @xmath92 and any line bundle @xmath250 . since @xmath251 and @xmath252 , to find the diffeomorphism type of the base from a monodromy equation we need only understand the parity of the first chern class of any suitable bundle @xmath92 above . specifically , in the complex case the map @xmath253 is the map defined by the sheaf @xmath254 and we know @xmath255 and more generally the sphere fibres of the ruled surface are the projectivisations of spaces of holomorphic sections of the canonical bundles down the fibres of @xmath6 . thus for any fibration @xmath6 we can take @xmath256 . from ( [ fracsign ] ) and ( [ maintheorem ] ) we know @xmath257 it follows that the parity of @xmath258 and the parity of @xmath259 coincide , and that is precisely what we require .",
    "we remark for completeness that these branched coverings can be used to give a classification of complex genus two fibrations without reducible fibres . for in these cases",
    "the branch locus is a complex curve and such curves are determined to smooth isotopy by their connectivity and homology class . in the connected case , we can `` canonically '' choose such a curve as follows ; write @xmath260 and @xmath261 for the homology classes of sections of a ruled surface @xmath262 of square @xmath248 respectively and @xmath47 for the homology class of a fibre . for",
    "a curve in a class @xmath263 choose @xmath14 fibres and @xmath87 sections since a genus two curve double covers a sphere over six points ; for the double cover to exist the branch divisor , and hence @xmath14 , will have to be even . ]",
    "meeting in disjoint nodes , giving a curve of @xmath264 components . now under a complex deformation of the fibration",
    "the branch locus will be perturbed to a neighbouring smooth complex curve .",
    "we can clearly arrange for all the fibres to lie over some small complex disc in the base @xmath15 and for all the nodes from intersection points of sections to lie outside the preimage of this disc .",
    "the monodromy of the lefschetz fibration arises entirely from a neighbourhood of the @xmath14 fibres in the branch locus and the other nodes , since these are the only places where we obtain singular fibres upstairs .",
    "smoothing the nodal branch locus over suitably chosen disjoint discs in the base sequentially , we see that the lefschetz fibrations arising from different branch loci coincide according to    rcl | r s_0 + ( 2 m ) f|__k & ~ & |r s_0|__k  # _  | rs_0 + 2mf |__0 + & ~ & |rs_0|__k  # _ m   |rs_0 + 2f|__0 + & ~ & #",
    "_ i=1^k  |rs_0|^(i)__1  # _",
    "j=1^m  |rs_0 + 2f|^(j)__0 .    thus all of the fibrations arising from connected branch loci can be expressed as fibre sums of two basic pieces .",
    "we have not yet considered disconnected branch loci .",
    "suppose then the branch locus is a curve in the class @xmath265 comprising two disjoint smooth components . from standard results on rational surfaces",
    "@xcite it follows that @xmath266 . in order for the class to contain six sections ( and hence yield a genus two fibration ) we are reduced to the case @xmath267 on @xmath268 .",
    "moreover we can write @xmath269 to obtain an even divisor ( as an element of the picard group , necessary for the existence of the double cover ) . again by standard results this class contains no smooth connected curve , and by the fibre summation trick , it is enough to understand the fibration when @xmath270 ; note that we can build a disconnected branch locus from only disconnected pieces , and all the pieces in a fibre sum decomposition will be of this special form @xmath271 in some @xmath272 .",
    "we have reduced all complex genus two fibrations with no reducible fibres to fibre sums of three basic examples .",
    "these can be computed in a variety of ways and we obtain the following classification result ( originally due to chakiris @xcite by similar methods and discovered independently if much later by the present author ) :    ( chakiris)[classify ] assume that a genus two fibration has no reducible fibres and khler total space .",
    "then it is a fibre sum of the shape @xmath273 or @xmath274 where @xmath275 and the basic words @xmath276 are given by :    rcl a  ( _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 5 _ 5 _ 4 _ 3 _ 2 _ 1)^2 = 1 & ~ & x _ 0 |6s _ + 2f| + b  ( _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 5)^6 = 1 & ~ & x _ 1 |6s_0 | + c  ( _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 ) ^10 = 1 & ~ & x _ 2 |5s_0| |s_| .",
    "it follows that if a genus two khler lefschetz fibration contains no separating vanishing cycles , then the total space is simply - connected .",
    "the notation @xmath277 indicates that @xmath6 is a @xmath278fold branched cover of @xmath70 totally ramified along the locus @xmath43 .",
    "the dehn twists @xmath45 are about curves in the `` standard position '' on a riemann surface ( c.f .",
    "@xcite for instance ) .",
    "note also that for the second family of words @xmath274 the monodromy group of the fibration is not full ; but to obtain an exhaustive list it is sufficient to take all fibre sums by the identity diffeomorphism .",
    "the word @xmath279 corresponds to the genus two pencil on a @xmath280 which double covers @xmath281 branched over a sextic .",
    "at higher genera the moduli spaces are not affine , and signature is _ not _ in general determined by the combinatorial equivalence class of the fibration . however ,",
    "for fibrations by hyperelliptic curves the statement is much easier .",
    "recall that in the @xmath282dimensional moduli space @xmath67 there is a distinguished @xmath283dimensional locus of _ hyperelliptic curves _ , which forms a complex analytic subvariety @xmath284 .",
    "we can take the closure of this subvariety in @xmath159 .",
    "the cohomology classes @xmath285}$ ] form a basis for @xmath286 ; here @xmath287 is the irreducible component of @xmath288 corresponding to generically irreducible curves , and the @xmath45 are the components corresponding to curves which generically have one component of genus @xmath132 and the other of genus @xmath289 .",
    "we can restrict these classes to @xmath290 where we denote them by the same symbols .",
    "the following relation seems to be new :        as a more significant application we provide the answer to a conjecture of amoros , bogomolov , katzarkov and pantev @xcite .",
    "the monodromy group of a lefschetz fibration is the subgroup of the mapping class group generated by the dehn twists about the vanishing cycles ; that is , the image of the representation @xmath292 .",
    "recall that the torelli group is the subgroup of the mapping class group comprising elements which act trivially on homology ; thus the monodromy group of @xmath10 is contained in the torelli group if and only if all the vanishing cycles are separating .",
    "( we will sometimes refer to such a fibration as a `` torelli fibration '' . )    for khler fibrations this can clearly never happen ; here is one classical proof . by taking the jacobians down the fibres , a khler fibration gives a map from the smooth locus @xmath293 to the moduli space of principally polarised abelian varieties @xmath294 .",
    "this map is holomorphic , and if the monodromy is trivial on homology groups and hence jacobians , we can canonically complete to a holomorphic map of the _ closed sphere _ into @xmath294 . but",
    "this is possible only if the map is constant , for @xmath294 is well known to be a bounded complex domain , and in particular contains no non - trivial holomorphic spheres .    in @xcite",
    "it is conjectured that in fact there can be no fibrations with monodromy group contained in the torelli group even in the absence of the khler assumption ( used via holomorphicity of the map to @xmath294 above ) .",
    "indeed this is true :      suppose such an @xmath238 exists ; we work by contradiction .",
    "we mentioned before that another approach to signature uses wall s non - additivity ; an easy case of this approach @xcite shows that if a fibration has @xmath9 separating vanishing cycles and no others , then its signature is given by @xmath295 . comparing to the formula ( [ maintheorem ] ) this forces @xmath296\\rangle = 0 $ ] .",
    "we will prove that this quantity is positive .",
    "we have @xmath297 for any lefschetz fibration with @xmath9 singular fibres ; in our case , since all the vanishing cycles are homologically trivial , @xmath298 and hence @xmath299 . now",
    "the number of disjoint exceptional @xmath18spheres in @xmath6 is bounded by @xmath300 since each contributes a new homology class .",
    "the fibre of the fibration has self - intersection zero ; fibre - summing @xmath6 with itself by the identity if necessary , we can see that if any fibration with monodromy group contained in the torelli group exists , then one exists for which a section also has self - intersection even and in particular is not exceptional .",
    "thus the number of @xmath18spheres in @xmath6 may be assumed to be bounded above by @xmath299 .",
    "we invoke a powerful theorem of liu : for any minimal symplectic 4manifold @xmath74 which is not irrational ruled , @xmath301 . in particular , blowing down all @xmath18spheres in @xmath6 , we see that @xmath302 and hence @xmath303 provided @xmath6 is not irrational ruled .",
    "but we also know @xmath304 \\rangle.\\ ] ] rearranging this gives @xmath305 \\rangle > 0 $ ] which is the required contradiction .",
    "that leaves only the case of @xmath6 irrational ruled , but simple topological conditions show that such a manifold can have no torelli fibration . for any torelli lefschetz fibration of @xmath306",
    "has fibres of genus @xmath307 by considering @xmath308 , and then looking at @xmath309 we see that in fact all the vanishing cycles must be nullhomotopic and hence @xmath6 was a trivial product .",
    "there are fibrations over the torus with no critical fibres which have monodromy group contained in the torelli group ; just take @xmath310 for @xmath70 the mapping torus of a dehn twist about a separating curve .",
    "the lefschetz fibrations of these manifolds , however , can not be torelli .    for any lefschetz fibration @xmath6 , @xmath311 .",
    "moreover the sphere @xmath312 defined to isotopy by @xmath6 has positive `` symplectic volume '' ; the symplectic weil  petersson form on @xmath0 evaluates positively on @xmath313 .",
    "the corollary again follows by comparing to ozbagci s work ; for he proves that each critical fibre changes the signature by @xmath314 as you add handles to a trivial bundle over the disc .",
    "since we now know there must be a non - separating vanishing cycle , and his construction allows us to add that handle first and change the signature by a non - negative amount , we obtain the first result .",
    "in particular , it follows that for _ any _ smooth sphere in @xmath159 with correct geometric intersection behaviour at the compactification divisors , the chern class @xmath315 evaluates positively .",
    "the khler weil ",
    "petersson form is not quite a positive rational multiple of this chern class and the boundary divisors ; rather we have the identity ( technically on the moduli stack ) @xmath316 an easy computation , however , shows that @xmath317 and @xmath318 together imply that the weil ",
    "petersson form evaluates positively .",
    "this is made more interesting by the following remark .",
    "wolpert has computed the intersection ring of @xmath159 and it follows from his computation that this is _ not _ a purely homological statement @xcite ; there are two dimensional homology classes which have positive intersections with all the components of @xmath161 but not with @xmath319 . thus the corollary is a kind of `` symplectic ampleness '' phenomenon , reliant on the _ local _ positivity of intersections with the stable locus ."
