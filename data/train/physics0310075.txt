    "over billions of years , a fascinating internal and external complexity evolved in myriads of competing biological species @xcite .",
    "for example , many bacteria and multi - cellular organisms use structure - sensitive proteins to biomineralize nanocrystals @xcite , that form unique nanodevices . these _",
    "cold_-growth techniques @xcite could greatly complement growth methods developed by humans . in general , biosystems and artificial nanosystems can coexist and supplement each other in a number of other directions , in particular , during the release of drugs @xcite .",
    "their coevolution can lead to the formation of new hybrid _ bio - nano _ ( biona ) systems , with unprecedented organizational and functional level .    in this letter",
    ", we discuss possible forms of communication between biona components .",
    "the ( direct )  talk \" from the nanosystem to the biosystem could be realized by controlling catalytic activity of its proteins .",
    "the ( backward )  talk \" could be done by the cells , if they change their local micro - environment or emit ( electromagnetic ) signals .",
    "the direct talk , that we explore here in more details , could be based on electrochemical methods , used in bioelectronics @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these techniques require the presence of electrodes @xcite , that can not be easily applied inside cells .",
    "more promising is thus their combination with _ contactless",
    "_ methods .",
    "optical techniques @xcite are convenient for their selectivity , but the sensitive interior of cells prohibits the use of large optical frequencies that can easily manipulate chemical bonds .",
    "we could thus use the fact that cells are transparent ( up to 5 mm thick samples ) for the _ near - infrared _ ( nir ) radiation ( 0.74 - 1.2@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the activity of biosystems could be manipulated via artificial nanosystems , embedded in them , that absorb in the nir region .",
    "this approach is followed in photodynamic therapies , where tumor cells are destructed chemically , via nir excitation of porphyrin - based molecules with many extended electronic states @xcite .",
    "similar results can be obtained by heating the system locally with ultrasound or microwave radiation or via nir - radiation heated metallic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "silver and gold nanoparticles @xcite , that can be produced biologically @xcite , are naturally excellent candidates for use in bio - control . in order to control tinny cellular sections",
    ", one could also think of using nanotubes .",
    "metallic c nanotubes form sensitive detectors in liquid environments @xcite , and when dressed with bio - molecules , via structure - selective @xcite or less specific hydrophobic coupling @xcite , they can work as sensitive biosensors @xcite .",
    "the bio - control could be elegantly realized by a _ hybrid _ nanotube rope , heated by nir - radiation , that is formed of two adjacent metallic c nanotubes ,",
    "where one is ( peapod ) filled with _ metallofullerenes _ @xcite and the other is empty . in peapods , electrons can be transferred to / from the c@xmath1 fullerenes under electric bias @xcite . in isolated metallofullerenes like dy@c@xmath2",
    ", several electrons are passed from dy to c@xmath2 .",
    "when these are used in a peapod , the transferred electrons can be passed further to the nanotube @xcite . in a double - rope formed by this peapod and a  twin \" ( empty ) nanotube ,",
    "the last would absorb the excessive charge too , so the two would become oppositely charged . this process can be partly _ inverted _ at elevated temperatures @xcite , since the metallofullerenes have levels close to the fermi level @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ biona1 ] , we schematically show the nir - control of protein ( enzyme ) activity , based on this process .",
    "the nir excitation heats the two nanotubes , so that electrons , released in equilibrium from the fullerenes to the peapod @xcite and the twin tube , become transferred _",
    "back_. this transfer is accompanied by recharging of the tubes , and the resulting change of the local electric field causes deformation of proteins @xcite , that are selectively attached to the nanotubes .",
    "their new conformation can have a largely different catalytic activity @xcite .",
    "the system thus works in an opposite way than some biosensors @xcite , where antibodies bind to proteins attached to material surfaces , bend them , and thus change the surface electric parameters .",
    "we can tune the system by using different nanotubes , fullerenes and their filling , and especially proteins , to be controlled .",
    "the attached proteins , that in general could be much bigger than the tubular system , might help to dissolve the hydrophobic nanotubes in water .",
    "we consider that the system is formed by two metallic ( 10,10 ) carbon nanotubes of the radius @xmath3 nm , where _ one _ of them is the peapod . in a double - rope @xcite ,",
    "their centers are separated by @xmath4 nm , which determines the tunneling time , @xmath5 ps , of electrons between the tubes . the fullerenes are separated one from another by @xmath6 nm @xcite , and their charging strongly but locally deforms electronic bands of the peapod @xcite .",
    "we can excite the metallic nanotubes at deliberate nir frequencies .",
    "their absorbtion fits the drude formula for the dielectric function @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 ev is the plasma frequency , @xmath9 and @xmath10 s. the irradiation , needed to induce reabsorbtion of electrons by the fullerenes , would have to heat the nanotubes by several tens of degrees @xcite .",
    "this should not be harmful _ in vivo _",
    ", if we use , for example , short ( few nanometers long ) nanotube _ capsules _",
    "@xcite , and isolate them in liposomes @xcite , that can be delivered to the cells by special techniques .    in the lack of available data ,",
    "we assume here that one electron _ per _",
    "fullerene is reabsorbed during the irradiation , and @xmath11 of those come from the empty tube .",
    "this gives the nir - radiation induced _ recharging _ density @xmath12 nm@xmath13 . from this @xmath14",
    ", we can calculate the change of electric field between the two tubes . if we assume that these two are _ ideal _ metallic cylinders of length l , their electric capacity is @xcite @xmath15 @xmath16 thus , the potential difference between the nanotubes due to the induced charge transfer is @xmath17 where we use the permitivity of water @xmath18 .",
    "similar voltage was used , for example , in manipulation of proteins attached to metals @xcite .",
    "activation of the attached protein by this nir - radiation induced potential can be realized by moving a _ charged tip _ of one of its domains @xcite ( see fig .  [ biona2 ] ) .",
    "we model this process , by evaluating first the potential energy of a charge @xmath19 at the position @xmath20 .",
    "the two cylinders with charge densities @xmath14 and @xmath21 have their centers are at @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the potential energy of the charge @xmath19 is formed by the _",
    "coulombic component @xcite @xmath24 that can be either positive or negative , depending on which of the oppositely charged tubes is closer .",
    "it also has a negative _ screening _ component @xcite , originating in the reflection of the external charge in the metallic tube , that close to the surface of both tubes has the form @xmath25 here , we simply add the screening potentials of the two tubes , neglecting thus multiple reflections .",
    "typically , structural domains in proteins perform _ hinge _ or _ shear _ motion @xcite .",
    "these domains are often formed by ( rigid ) @xmath26-helices , connected by ( flexible ) @xmath27-sheets .",
    "the structures ( conformations ) of deformed proteins in nature are usually close in energies , so that they can be flipped over by room temperature energies k@xmath28 t @xcite .",
    "the conformations of the externally controlled proteins should have different catalytic properties and be more energetically distant , so that they are not changed at room temperatures .    in the present system , where the control of protein s motion is realized via dynamical charging of nanotubes",
    ", we can also consider these two generic ( hinge and shear ) configurations , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ biona2 ] .",
    "since , the tubes are different and become charged in equilibrium , the proteins should be able to _ distinguish _ them and deposit on them _ asymmetrically _ ( see figs .",
    "[ biona1]-[biona2 ] ) . in the bend configuration ( left ) , the trajectory of the controlled protein domain is practically vertical , toward one of the tube s centers . in the shear configuration ( right )",
    ", the trajectory of the domain goes approximately in parallel with the vector connecting the tube s centers of masses .",
    "we assume that the balance of internal forces in the protein , in the presence of equilibrium charging of the tubes , adjusts the charged tip to a position @xmath29 .",
    "the dependence of the protein energy around ( close to ) this position can be considered to be parabolic @xmath30 where the constants @xmath31 , @xmath32 describe rigidity of the deformed protein @xcite .",
    "their values should be such , that the difference in energies @xmath33 between the used conformations is kt@xmath34 kj / mol ( 1 ev ) , where the last value is the lower energy limit required to deform _ individual _ protein domains @xcite .",
    "in order to estimate which of the configurations , in fig .",
    "[ biona2 ] , can be more easily controlled , we calculate the _ distance _ over which the protein domains move during the nir - radiation induced charge transfer . the tip moves from the equilibrium position @xmath35 to a new position @xmath36 , given by the local minimum of the total potential @xmath37      in fig .",
    "[ biona3 ] ( up ) , we search this minimum for the  hinge \" configuration , shown in fig .",
    "[ biona2 ] ( left ) .",
    "the tube centers are located at @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "we present the dependence of the potentials @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 on the @xmath45 distance from the center of the right nanotube , and assume that a unit charge @xmath46 is at the tip of the domain @xcite .",
    "the results are calculated for the ( effective ) charge density @xmath47 e / nm ( equilibrium ) and @xmath48 ( irradiation ) .",
    "we position the domain tip at @xmath49 , @xmath50 and use the rigidity constant @xmath51 ev / nm@xmath52 .",
    "we can see that the _ change _ of the @xmath41 potential energy , due to the induced charge transfer , is small , while @xmath42 is rather large . with the above parameters ,",
    "the @xmath43 potential can _ locally _ compensate the steep @xmath42 , so that close to the tubes their sum is almost flat . then",
    ", the weak @xmath41 potential can control the position of the local minimum in @xmath44 , but the overall motion is quite small ( thin and thick solid line correspond to equilibrium and irradiation , respectively ) .",
    "the magnitude of motion could be enlarged , if we let the @xmath44 potential to loose the local minimum in the _ absence _ of irradiation .",
    "then the domain position would _ fluctuate _ from being adjacent to the tube to being almost at @xmath35 .",
    "such a large motion can be obtained directly in the  shear \" configuration , shown in fig .",
    "[ biona2 ] ( right ) . here , the in - plane ( of the tubes ) components of the screening forces largely cancel each other , and the out - of - plane components are not effective",
    ". thus the system responds more sensitively to the charging given by @xmath41 , as we show in fig .",
    "[ biona3 ] ( down ) .",
    "we use parameters , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ev / nm@xmath52 , so that @xmath43 can _ flatten _ the two - well minima of @xmath42 . in equilibrium",
    ", the tube charging causes that @xmath44 develops a minimum , close to one of the @xmath42 minima . during the irradiation , the charging decreases and the minimum shifts to @xmath56 .",
    "since the two conformations are shifted in energy by @xmath57 mev , they would not flip one to another at room temperatures kt@xmath58 mev .",
    "this domain motion is large enough to control the protein ( enzyme ) activity .",
    "it could open or block pockets on the  back side \" of the protein , that is not exposed to the nanotube , and change the catalytic strength of the proteins .",
    "we have demonstrated that nir - radiation excited hybrid nanotube ropes could control the activity of proteins _ in vivo_. nanotube systems might also _ directly _ activate chemical reactions used in phototherapy @xcite , in particular , if special  porphyrin - like \" defects are formed in the nanotube walls .",
    "_ in vitro _ , one could also bias nanotubes externally in order to control biochemical reactions or use them in other applications on the nanoscale @xcite ."
