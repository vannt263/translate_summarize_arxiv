    "the investigation of the qcd phase diagram is a very important subject both theoretically and experimentally nowadays . the ongoing and future heavy ion experiments such as rhic , and cern / lhc study the low density part of the phase diagram which can also be investigated theoretically by lattice qcd , at cbm / fair the high density part will be studied , which is still not settled theoretically , so it is worth to investigate the phase diagram thoroughly .    our starting point is the ( axial)vector meson extended linear sigma model with additional constituent quarks and polyakov - loop variables .",

    "it is important to note that in the present work we also included in the scalar and pseudoscalar masses the contributions coming from the fermion vacuum fluctuations by adapting the method of @xcite .",

    "in our approach we have four order parameters , which are the @xmath31 non - strange and @xmath32 strange condensates , and the @xmath2 and @xmath33 polyakov - loop variables .",
    "the condensates arise due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking and @xmath34 , while the polyakov - loop variables naturally emerge in mean field approximation , if one calculates free fermion grand canonical potential on a constant gluon background .",
    "the effect of fermions propagating on a constant gluon background in the temporal direction formally amounts to the appearance of imaginary color dependent chemical potentials ( for details see @xcite ) .    at finite temperature / baryochemical potential",
    "we can set up four coupled field equations for the four fields , which are just the requirements that the first derivatives of the grand canonical potential according to the fields must vanish .",
    "as a first approximation we apply a hybrid approach in which we only consider vacuum and thermal fluctuations for the fermions , but not for the bosons .",
    "we use a mean field polyakov - loop potential @xmath35 of a polynomial form with coefficients determined in @xcite . within this simplified treatment",
    "the equations are the following : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 with the modified distribution functions @xmath39",

    "if we set @xmath43 we get @xmath44  gev , which is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "however in this case we get a very high pseudocritical temperature , @xmath45  mev , for @xmath31 , which is much larger than earlier results ( e.g. on lattice @xmath46  mev @xcite ) . now , if we tune @xmath11 to get @xmath47 mev ( which corresponds to the physical particle @xmath48 ) , than @xmath49 goes down to @xmath50  mev , which can be seen in fig .",

    "this finding is in line with the results of @xcite , where they used a similar model , but without vector mesons .",
    "this suggests that in order to get a good pseudocritical temperature we would need a scalar - isoscalar particle with low mass ( @xmath51  mev ) , which is probably not a @xmath40 state according to @xcite .",
