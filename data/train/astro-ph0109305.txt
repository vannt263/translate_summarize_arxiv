    "the swift increase of the number of absorptions ( and the average opacity ) with increasing redshift is the most impressive property of the ly-@xmath4  forest . fig .",
    "[ dndz ] shows the number density evolution of the ly-@xmath4  lines @xcite in the column density interval  has been chosen to allow a comparison with the hst key - programme sample at @xmath5 @xcite for which a threshold in equivalent width of 0.24  was adopted . ]",
    "the long - dashed line is the maximum - likelihood fit to the data at @xmath7 with the customary parameterization : @xmath8 .",
    "the uves @xcite observations imply that the turn - off in the evolution does occur at @xmath9 , not at @xmath10 as previously suggested .",
    "-0.2 cm    the evolution of the @xmath11 is governed by two main factors : the hubble expansion and the metagalactic uv background ( uvb ) . at high @xmath12 both the expansion ,",
    "which decreases the density and tends to increase the ionization , and the uvb , which is increasing or non - decreasing with decreasing redshift , work in the same direction and cause a steep evolution of the number of lines . at low @xmath12 ,",
    "the uvb starts to decrease with decreasing redshift , due to the reduced number and intensity of the ionizing sources , counteracting the hubble expansion . as a result",
    "the evolution of the number of lines slows down .    up to date numerical simulations",
    "@xcite have been remarkably successful in qualitatively reproducing the observed evolution , however they predict the break in the @xmath13  power - law at a redshift @xmath14 that appears too high in the light of the new uves results .",
    "this suggests that the uvb implemented in the simulations may not be the correct one : it was thought that at low redshift qsos are the main source of ionizing photons , and , since their space density drops below @xmath15 , so does the uvb .",
    "however , galaxies can produce a conspicuous ionizing flux too , perhaps more significant than it was thought@xcite .",
    "the galaxy contribution can keep the uvb relatively high until at @xmath9 the global star formation rate in the universe quickly decreases , determining the qualitative change in the number density of lines . under relatively general assumptions ,",
    "it is possible to relate the observed number of lines above a given threshold in column density or equivalent width to the expansion , the uvb , the distribution in column density of the absorbers and the cosmology : @xmath16^{\\beta-1 } h^{-1}(z ) , \\label{eq : dndz}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the photoionization rate and the @xmath18  distribution is assumed to follow a power - law of index @xmath19 , as discussed in the next section .    -0.7",
    "fig .  [ nhi ] shows the differential density distribution function measured by uves @xcite , that is the number of lines per unit redshift path and per unit @xmath18  as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "the distribution basically follows a power - law @xmath20 extending over 10 orders of magnitude with little , but significant deviations , which become more evident and easy to interpret if the plot is transformed in the mass distribution of the photoionized gas as a function of the density contrast , @xmath21 , @xcite : 1 ) a flattening at @xmath22 is partly due to line crowding and partly to the turnover of the density distribution below the mean density ; 2 ) a steepening at @xmath23 , with a deficiency of lines that becomes more and more evident at lower z , reflects the fall - off in the density distribution due to the onset of rapid , non - linear collapse : the slope @xmath19 goes from about @xmath24 at @xmath25 to @xmath26 at @xmath27 and recent hst stis data @xcite confirm that this trend continues at lower redshift measuring at @xmath28 a slope of @xmath29 ; 3 ) a flattening at @xmath30 can be attributed to the flattening of the density distribution at @xmath31 due to the virialization of collapsed matter .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations successfully reproduce this behaviour , indicating that the derived matter distribution is indeed consistent with what would be expected from gravitational instability .",
    "the last ingredient to be determined in eq .  [ eq : dndz ] is the ionization rate . in a recent computation",
    "@xcite we have investigated the contribution of galaxies to the uvb , exploring three values for the fraction of ionizing photons that can escape the galaxy ism , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( the latter value corresponds to the lyman - continuum flux detected by @xcite in the composite spectrum of 29 lyman - break galaxies ) .",
    "estimates of the uvb based on the proximity effect at high-@xmath12 and on the @xmath34 emission in high - latitude galactic clouds at low-@xmath12 provide an upper limit on @xmath35 , consistent with recent results on individual galaxies both at low-@xmath12 @xcite and at @xmath36 @xcite . introducing a contribution of galaxies to the uvb ,",
    "the break in the ly-@xmath4  @xmath13  can be better reproduced than with a pure qso contribution @xcite .",
    "the agreement improves considerably also at @xmath37 . besides , models with @xmath38 describe the flat evolution of the absorbers much better than @xmath39 .",
    "a consistency check is provided by the evolution of the lower column density lines .",
    "for @xmath40 the @xmath18  distribution is flatter , and according to eq .",
    "[ eq : dndz ] this translates directly into a slower evolutionary rate , which is consistent with the uves observations@xcite : @xmath41 .",
    "another diagnostic can be derived from the spectral shape of the uvb and its influence on the intensity ratios of metal lines @xcite .",
    "given the cosmological scenario , the amount of baryons required to produce the opacity of the lyman forest can be computed @xcite and a lower - bound to the cosmic baryon density derived from the distribution of the ly-@xmath4  optical depths .",
    "applying this approach to the effective optical depths measured in the uves spectra , the estimated lower bound @xmath42 is consistent with the bbn value for a low d / h primordial abundance .",
    "most of the baryons reside in the lyman forest at @xmath43 with little change in the contribution to @xmath44 as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "conversely , given the observed opacity , a higher uvb requires a higher @xmath45 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the large escape fraction measured by @xcite would result in an @xmath46 in strong conflict either with the d / h or in general with the bbn or with the ly-@xmath4  opacity measurements .",
