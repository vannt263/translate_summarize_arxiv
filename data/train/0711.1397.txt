    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) are characterized by a dramatic change in the ground state of a many - body system prompted by a change of the parameters @xmath0 specifying the hamiltonian @xmath1 of the system . unlike classical phase transitions , which are driven by thermal fluctuations ,",
    "quantum phase transitions occur at t = 0 and are driven solely by quantum fluctuations . in particular , second order quantum phase transitions are characterized by a gap between the ground state and first excited state that vanishes at criticality @xcite .",
    "+ the analysis of these transitions has benefited from tools of quantum information theory .",
    "the von neumann entropy and fidelity applied to many - body systems can identify phase transitions and reveal different scaling behaviors at different regions of the phase diagram @xcite-@xcite .",
    "more recently it has been shown that the quantum fidelity  a distinguishability measure between quantum states  can identify the quantum phase transition by comparing two ground states corresponding to slightly different values of the coupling constants @xmath0 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this new approach provides an alternative to the study of phase transitions using order parameters and symmetry breaking patterns , which depends on _ a priori _ knowledge of the physics of the problem @xcite . +",
    "another distinguishability measure for density operators was very recently introduced : the quantum chernoff bound @xcite@xcite .",
    "suppose there are @xmath2 copies each of two density matrices @xmath3 and @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and one set has been given to us .",
    "we know what @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , but we do nt know which set we received .",
    "there is always a two - outcome povm @xmath7 that measures and distinguishes one set of @xmath2-copy states from the other such that the probability of making a misidentification , @xmath8 , is minimized . in general",
    ", this probability will depend on the number of copies . in the asymptotic limit of @xmath2",
    "very large , the probability of misidentification has a particularly simple exponential dependence on @xmath2 given by @xmath9 .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is called the quantum chernoff bound .",
    "it is a function of the density matrices only , with @xmath11 .",
    "the classical version of this problem was analyzed for the first time by h. chernoff @xcite .",
    "it took 50 years to prove the quantum version of this problem .",
    "+ the quantum chernoff bound has many interesting properties . among these is monotonicity under cp maps , which makes it a valid distinguishability measure @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath10 has an operational meaning arising from a statistical inference problem .",
    "intuitively , we see that for a fixed probability of error @xmath8 , the larger @xmath10 is the smaller the number of copies of @xmath3 and @xmath4 we will need in order to distinguish them . + in the present work , we apply the quantum chernoff bound as a distinguishability measure to the manifold of gibbs or thermal states associated with the anisotropic xy model in a transverse magnetic field . in the spirit of the information - theoretic and differential geometric approach advocated in @xcite , we will compare states corresponding to hamiltonians with slightly different values of the parameters @xmath0 to derive a metric tensor for the parameter manifold itself .",
    "this metric detects the second order quantum phase transitions of the xy model and shows the influence of finite temperature effects over the zero - temperature critical points .",
    "it is shown that the different regions of the @xmath12 phase diagram of the system above the t=0 critical points can be characterized by the different scaling behavior of the metric tensor with temperature . this paper parallels and extends the analysis reported in @xcite for the bures metric .",
    "while the quantum chernoff bound is associated with quantum state discrimination , the bures metric is related with another natural probabilistic protocol : quantum estimation @xcite .",
    "our findings about the quantum chernoff bound metric show that the same information about the phase diagram of an interacting many - body system can be obtained by using two independent distinguishability measures . + this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the many - body system we analyzed and obtain the corresponding metric tensor in section iii . in section",
    "iv we carry out the thermal analysis of the metric elements . a global property of the metric",
    "is discussed in section v , while conclusions and further research directions are outlined in section vi .",
    "we analyze the quantum phase transitions of the one - dimensional spin chain xy model in a transverse magnetic field given by the hamiltonian    @xmath13    where the total number of spins @xmath14 is odd , @xmath15 is the transverse magnetic field along the z - axis , and @xmath16 $ ] is the anisotropy parameter . for @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "we obtain the ising and xx models , respectively .",
    "this hamiltonian can be diagonalized using jordan - wigner , fourier and bogoliubov transformations @xcite .",
    "the diagonalized hamiltonian is given by @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the quasi - particle energies given by @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "one - particle excitations are created by the fermionic operators @xmath24 acting on the ground state @xmath25 with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "this model exhibits a quantum phase transition at two regions in the parameter space @xmath28 : at critical lines @xmath29 , and @xmath18 for @xmath30 . at those critical regions the system becomes gapless . in general the gap @xmath31 is given by : @xmath32 if @xmath33 ( region a ) ; @xmath34 if @xmath35 ( region b ) .",
    "the quantum chernoff bound ( qcb ) is given by @xmath36 where @xmath9 is the minimum probability of error in distinguishing two preparations @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the limit @xmath37 @xcite@xcite .",
    "defining @xmath38 , the quantity @xmath39 serves as a distinguishability measure between states .",
    "notice that @xmath40 , and @xmath41 if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are orthogonal .",
    "considering two nearby states @xmath3 and @xmath42 , this quantity induces a metric tensor on the manifold of density operators , with the line element given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a spectral decomposition of the density operator .",
    "since we are interested in the finite temperature xy model , we consider thermal states of the form @xmath45 . taking the spectral decomposition of @xmath3 over eigenstates of the hamiltonian",
    ", we can split the metric into two parts so that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 we call the first sum the classical part of the metric since it only depends on the boltzmann weights of the density operator .",
    "we label the second sum the non - classical or quantum part , because it explicitly depends on the states . + in passing",
    "we would like to notice that @xmath48 does not , strictly speaking , define a metric in the parameter space .",
    "indeed one can have curves @xmath49 of density matrices where all the relevant @xmath50 are fixed , e.g. @xmath51 in other terms , the quadratic form defined at each point of the parameter manifold is just positive - semidefinite rather than positive definite and the metric matrix can have zero eigenvalues .",
    "this remark has to be kept in mind when one considers the zero - temperature limit @xmath52 where , as we will see , @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , in this limit @xmath54 is nothing but the fubini - study metric over the projective state space ( the same is obtained by starting from the bures metric ) .",
    "once this latter is pulled back to the parameter space null eigenvectors can appear .",
    "these vectors correspond to directions along which changing the parameters results in indistinguishable states .",
    "+ to evaluate the first sum ( [ dsc ] ) , note that @xmath55 where @xmath56 + summing over states and incorporating the fermion statistics @xmath57 and using the free - fermion property @xmath58 we get the following six components for the 3x3 symmetric metric tensor defined by @xmath59 , @xmath60 @xmath61 in order to find the metric @xmath62 corresponding to @xmath48 we first use the expression for the eigenstates ( [ gs ] ) to obtain @xmath63 differentiating @xmath64 along each of our three parameters gives the metric @xmath62 .",
    "this part of the metric has only three nonzero components , namely @xmath65 notice that @xmath66 vanishes along the line @xmath67",
    "we now proceed to analyze the scaling behavior of the metric elements with temperature , for two characteristic regions in the parameter space @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 : quantum - critical and quasi - classical . for the quantum - critical case",
    "we analyze the scaling at the critical region . for the quasi - classical case",
    "we carry out the scaling analysis away from the critical region , for temperatures small enough so that the system looks effectively gapped , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "we carry out the analysis in the thermodynamic limit , in which @xmath72 , @xmath73 after rescaling @xmath74 .",
    "+      we now find the scaling behavior with temperature for the metric element @xmath75 , in the limit @xmath71 .",
    "the scaling of all other metric elements can be obtained following procedures similar to those illustrated below .",
    "+ since the system is gapped in this region , we have @xmath76 .",
    "this permits us to make the following approximation in the integral expression for @xmath75 : @xmath77 .",
    "then , @xmath75 can be approximated by    @xmath78    the exponential @xmath79 behaves like a sharp peak in @xmath80 centered around the absolute minima of @xmath81 and can be approximated further by expanding @xmath81 to second order in @xmath80 .",
    "the minima of @xmath81 occur at @xmath82 for region a , @xmath83 ; at @xmath84 for region b ; and at @xmath85 for region a , @xmath86 .",
    "+ due to the peak of @xmath79 , the rest of the integrand can be approximated by its value at the minimum of @xmath81 in region b , or expanded until second order in @xmath80 in region a. taking the limits of integration to be from @xmath87 to @xmath88 , this approximation results in gaussian integrals , with the result given by @xmath89    where the exponent @xmath90 of the temperature is equal to @xmath91 for region a , and @xmath92 for region b. each metric element will have a different @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , the classical terms of the metric elements can be approximated by @xmath94    in table [ tab : table1 ] we summarize the scaling in temperature for all the metric elements in the quasi - classical region .",
    ".temperature exponent @xmath90 , for classical and nonclassical terms of the metric elements in the quasi - classical region .",
    "the nonclassical terms follow a behavior given by ( [ nc ] ) , while the classical terms behave like ( [ c ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the behavior of the nonclassical metric elements in the quantum - critical region can be inferred from dimensional scaling analysis as was done in @xcite , for zero temperature . though carried out for the bures metric",
    ", it applies also for the quantum chernoff bound metric .",
    "from @xcite we see that the scaling dimension of the nonclassical metric elements @xmath95 , and @xmath75 is given by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 are the scaling dimensions of the operators that couple to @xmath98 and produce the quantum phase transitions , @xmath99 is the dynamical exponent , and @xmath100 the spatial dimensionality .",
    "the finite temperature in the quantum system transforms into a finite additional length dimension in the classical system so that @xmath101 the findings summarized in table [ tab : table3 ] are consistent with this relation , assuming that : @xmath102 ( 1st column , @xmath103 ) ; @xmath104 ( 2nd column , @xmath105 ) ; @xmath106 ( 3rd column , @xmath107 the condition @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) signals the relevance , in the renormalization group sense @xcite , of the operator weighted by the coupling constant @xmath110 @xmath111 + intuitively , shifting some parameter towards a critical value should result in a significant change in the state of our system .",
    "that is , the direction in parameter space corresponding to maximal distinguishability should be towards or away from the critical regions . indeed we see that the diverging metric element in the gapless quantum critical case corresponds to exactly this direction of maximal distinguishability . as an example , for @xmath112 and @xmath113 only @xmath114 diverges .",
    "changing @xmath115 and keeping @xmath69 constant here corresponds to the direction of maximal distinguishability , which is along the @xmath114 contribution to the line element . in the ising model limit , where @xmath116 , our results for the metric scaling agrees exactly with that of @xcite , where the bures metric was used .",
    "in this brief section we consider the maximum eigenvalue of the metric @xmath117 for each point in parameter space .",
    "since @xmath117 is a symmetric matrix , this corresponds to the matrix norm @xmath118 .",
    "the associated eigenvectors define the field of maximum distinguishability directions .",
    "an analogous analysis for the bures metric has been presented in @xcite . from the inequalities",
    "@xmath119 one immediately sees that the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath117 diverges iff at least one of the matrix elements of @xmath117 diverges . in other words , @xmath120 encodes global information about the metric that one can extract without analyzing each of the matrix elements separately .    shown in figure [ fig : contour ]",
    "is a contour plot of the maximum eigenvalues of @xmath117 .",
    "the critical regions are clearly revealed as those values of the parameters for which some metric elements diverge for small temperature .     for @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "the color scale goes from 0 ( purple ) , to 3 ( white ) .",
    "the critical regions can be clearly identified . ]",
    "in this paper we have employed the metric tensor induced on the parameter space by the quantum chernoff bound to study the finite - temperature phase diagram of the anisotropic xy spin chain .",
    "we have shown that the temperature scaling of the metric elements has a different form in the quasi - classical and quantum - critical cases . in the quasi - classical case , where the temperature @xmath124 is much smaller than the energy gap @xmath125",
    "the metric elements vanish exponentially in @xmath126 in the quantum - critical regime @xmath127 , the behavior is a power law in @xmath124 .",
    "moreover , in the quasi - classical case the specific behavior in temperature depends on the functional form of the gap @xmath31 , and in the quantum critical case the nonclassical metric element which diverges in the limit of @xmath128 is the one corresponding to the relevant parameter driving the qpt .",
    "we would like to notice that , in view of the operational meaning of the quantum chernoff bound metric in quantum state discrimination tasks , these results suggest that quantum criticality may provide a resource for quantum state discrimination protocols .",
    "this connection has been elaborated in @xcite for the related quantum estimation problem .",
    "another problem that is worthy of investigation and has not been touched in this paper is the role of the curvature tensor associated to the metric @xmath129 the preliminary findings for the same quantity in the pure state case @xcite and in the bures metric case @xcite suggest that the curvature might provide additional information about the nature of the critical lines and location of crossover regions .",
    "the analysis reported in this paper for the @xmath130 chain is quite close in spirit and technicalities to the one for the bures metric in the quantum ising model case @xcite . in both cases",
    "the important physical features of the low - temperature phase diagram of the systems , e.g. , quantum - critical to quasi - classical crossovers , can be identified by resorting to a metric with a statistical distinguishability meaning .",
    "this proves that the information - theoretic metrical approach to quantum criticality @xcite is not bound to the use of a special single metric .",
    "different choices of distinguishability measure may provide essentially the same physical information .",
