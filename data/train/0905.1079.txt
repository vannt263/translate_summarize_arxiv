    "the physically relevant degrees of freedom of a large isolated system initially out of equilibrium , are expected to relax to their thermal equilibrium values .",
    "obviously , no relaxation behavior can be observed for the complete quantum state of the system but interesting degrees of freedom can evolve irreversibly in the limit of a large system .",
    "this issue of thermalisation in isolated quantum systems has been principally investigated by considering composite systems consisting of two distinguishable subsystems of very different sizes . for such systems , the smaller subsystem relaxes to thermal equilibrium if the larger one is assumed to be in an equilibrium mixed state @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that a priori thermal averaging is not essential .",
    "the small subsystem can thermalise whereas the whole isolated system is in a pure quantum state @xcite .",
    "an isolated system of identical particles can not be divided into distinguishable subsystems and the relevant degrees of freedom are , in this case , the n - particle reduced distribution functions such as the particle number density .",
    "relaxation behaviors have been obtained for both integrable @xcite and nonintegrable systems @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the system is supposed to be initially in the ground state of a given hamiltonian but its subsequent time evolution is governed by a different hamiltonian .",
    "for example , a gas is considered to be initially confined in a subvolume of a larger accessible space .",
    "the single - particle distributions were always found to relax to asymptotic profiles but which are , intriguingly , not all well described by an equilibrium ensemble .    to better apprehend the thermalisation process in isolated many - body systems , it is necessary not to be limited to ground states and to be able to treat also finite initial temperatures",
    ". as we are concerned with isolated systems , such an initial condition must be represented by a microcanonical mixed state , according to the postulate of equal a priori probabilities , or , equivalently , by a pure state of macroscopically well - defined energy @xcite . in ref.@xcite , the time - dependent particle density of a perfect quantum gas ,",
    "initially in such a state , has been determined .",
    "it was found that this density relaxes from a thermal profile to a non - thermal one . in view of these results ,",
    "one may wonder how two quantum systems , initially independent of each other but at the same temperature , evolve if they are brought into thermal contact .",
    "do their relevant degrees of freedom remain at equilibrium once they are coupled ?    in this paper , we address this issue by considering a free bosonic field in two one - dimensional cavities coupled to each other by one of their ends .",
    "free fields are commonly used to describe the large number of environmental degrees of freedom which give rise to dissipation in a smaller system @xcite . here",
    ", we are interested in two systems of comparable size , neither of them acts as a heat bath for the other one . in section [ m ] , we present our model hamiltonian of two quantum systems in thermal contact .",
    "this model allows to describe from perfectly coupled to completely uncoupled systems .",
    "we show that the considered coupling between the two cavities is thermodynamically small by evaluating the equilibrium total energy and correlation functions . in section [ scc ] ,",
    "we determine how the energy contents of the cavities and the field - field correlations evolve in response to a sudden change of the coupling between the two cavities .",
    "our model is simple enough to obtain exact results for arbitrary values of the coupling strength . in section [ cpg ] ,",
    "we discuss why , though the expressions are formally similar , relaxation behaviors are obtained for a perfect gas but not for the system studied here . finally , in the last section , we summarize our results and mention a few open questions raised by our work .",

    "we remark that the even eigenmodes @xmath17 contribute only to the steady component of @xmath244 , see the discussion after equation .",
    "the expectation values of the single - particle observables of an isolated perfect gas , its particle number density at a given point for instance , are also given by expressions of the form with the single - particle energies @xmath245 @xcite .",
    "consider as an example a one - dimensional perfect gas confined in a box of length @xmath0 . in this case , the single - particle energies are @xmath246 where @xmath154 is the particle mass and @xmath34 an integer .",
    "the frequencies @xmath247 are thus regularly spaced and @xmath244 is periodic with period @xmath248 . however , in the joule expansion studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , for times @xmath249 , the function @xmath250 in the integral expression of the gas density profile , can be approximated as a continuous function plus a term @xmath251 and @xmath244 essentially relaxes from its initial value to @xmath252 .",
    "the situation is radically different for the free field system considered in this paper .",
    "there obviously also exists a @xmath253 contribution to @xmath254 but @xmath244 does not relax .",
    "first of all , we observe that , in the limiting cases of vanishing and large @xmath43 , the function @xmath250 is a sum of equally spaced dirac delta functions and @xmath244 is strictly periodic with period @xmath195 as shown by and . for a finite @xmath43 ,",
    "the frequencies @xmath255 are not exactly equal to multiples of @xmath256 but most of them are close to these values , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre ] .",
    "as it is clear from equation , the spacing between consecutive frequencies @xmath257 varies and goes to zero for @xmath258 where @xmath259 .",
    "we see on fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre ] that @xmath260 in this limit .",
    "time regimes may then exist in which @xmath254 can be approximated as a sum of smooth functions with finite support .",
    "however , these functions clearly vanish at the right end of their support interval but not at the left one .",
    "consequently , their fourier transforms do not vanish fast enough at long times to lead to a relaxation behavior of @xmath244 .",
    "we find similar functions @xmath250 for the energy @xmath224 with the noticeable difference that the coefficients @xmath241 corresponding to the lowest frequencies @xmath261 are dominant in the large @xmath43 limit , giving rise to the sinusoidal behavior discussed at the end of the previous section .",
    "in this paper , we have studied how changing the thermal contact between two quantum systems whose elementary excitations are noninteracting bosons , affects these systems . more precisely , our model consists of two one - dimensional cavities of equal length coupled to each other by one of their ends .",
    "the coupling we have considered is thermodynamically small , as shown by the fact that the equilibrium total energy and correlation functions are practically independent of its strength , and allows to describe from perfectly coupled to completely uncoupled systems .",
    "we have seen that a sudden change of this thermal contact has a considerable impact on the correlation functions of the two cavities .",
    "they do not return to equilibrium but essentially oscillate with a period equal to twice the time required for a signal to propagate from one end of a cavity to the other .",
    "their exact time evolution is mainly controlled by the final coupling strength which determines the reflection and transmission coefficients at the interface between the two systems . we found a similar behavior for the energy content of the cavities .",
    "for weak coupling between them , it varies sinusoidally with a period set by the coupling strength .",
    "the absence of relaxation behavior is not simply a consequence of the fact that the considered hamiltonian is quadratic .",
    "the joule expansion of a perfect quantum gas has , for example , been obtained in ref .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , this difference in behavior comes from qualitative differences in the elementary excitation energy spectrum .",
    "clearly , the simple dispersion relation of our one - dimensional continuous field model , plays a crucial role in the temporal quasiperiodicity obtained",
    ". it would be thus interesting to study higher - dimensional and lattice free field systems .",
    "are interactions between the bosonic excitations necessary to ensure the stability of the thermal equilibrium ?",
    "to evaluate the energy for vanishing and large @xmath43 , we make use of @xmath262 where @xmath34 runs over all integers and @xmath263 is any function .    with this relation , we obtain , for large @xmath43 , @xmath264 where @xmath265 using the expansion @xmath266 and , we find , in the limit @xmath267 , @xmath268^{-2}$ ] for @xmath269 , and @xmath270 . replacing these expressions into leads to with .    for @xmath54 ,",
