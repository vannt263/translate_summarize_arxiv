    "recall from theorem [ thm - kob ] that , for any genus-2 heegaard surface @xmath68 of @xmath50 , @xmath357 ( @xmath108 ) is an essential saturated annulus in @xmath89 and @xmath358 is the 2-bridge sphere of @xmath30 .",

    "hence , @xmath50 admits a unique genus-2 heegaard surface whose hyper - elliptic involution is @xmath73 , a contradiction .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ thm - main ] .",
    "let @xmath0 be a torus link @xmath366 for some nonzero integer @xmath257 , and let @xmath33 , @xmath43 and @xmath367 be the three components of @xmath0 . let @xmath368 be a 3-bridge sphere of @xmath0 .",

    "since @xmath373 consists of two points for each @xmath292 , @xmath374 satisfies one of the following conditions ( see figure [ fig - int ] ) .",
    "* @xmath374 satisfies the condition ( i ) for every @xmath292 .",
    "* two of @xmath377 , @xmath378 and @xmath379 satisfies the condition ( i ) and the other satisfies the condition ( ii ) . * two of @xmath377 , @xmath378 and @xmath379 satisfies the condition ( ii ) and the other satisfies the condition ( i ) . * @xmath374 satisfies the condition ( ii ) for every @xmath292 .",
    "assume that @xmath368 satisfies the condition ( s1 ) .",
    "note that @xmath380 consists of two loops each of which contains one of the two points @xmath373 for every @xmath292 .",
    "suppose there is a loop component , @xmath381 , of @xmath382 other than @xmath383 .",
    "then @xmath381 bounds a disk in the interior of @xmath369 disjoint from @xmath383 for some @xmath292 , and hence , @xmath384 is a trivial 2-component link for each @xmath292 . on the other hand , @xmath381 either bounds a disk in @xmath385 or is isotopic to the core of the annulus component of @xmath385 . in the latter case ,",
    "the linking number of @xmath381 and a component of @xmath0 is @xmath75 ( see figure [ fig - int2 ] ) , a contradiction .",
    "hence , @xmath381 bounds a disk in @xmath385 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath381 is innermost ( in @xmath385 ) , then we can eliminate it from @xmath382 since the union of the two disks described above is a 2-sphere bounding a 3-ball in @xmath254 .",
    "hence , we may assume that @xmath386 .",
    "since @xmath383 cuts @xmath368 into two disks and an annulus , it bounds two disks in @xmath32 and bounds an annulus in @xmath53 .",
    "since such a disk is unique up to isotopy in @xmath387 and an annulus is unique up to isotopy in @xmath388 , @xmath0 admits a unique 3-bridge sphere satisfying the condition ( s1 ) .",
    "( we obtain two 3-bridge spheres when @xmath389 , but it can be easily seen that they are isotopic . )    assume that @xmath368 satisfies the condition ( s2 ) .",
    "note that @xmath380 is a loop containing the six points @xmath390 .",
    "thus any loop component of @xmath374 except @xmath383 bounds a disk in @xmath391 .",
    "this implies that any loop component of @xmath374 can not be a core of the annulus @xmath369 for each @xmath292 , since the linking number of the core of @xmath369 and a component of @xmath0 is @xmath392 .",
    "hence , any loop component of @xmath374 also bounds a disk in the interior of @xmath369 disjoint from @xmath383 , and hence , we can remove all such components by an isotopy .",
    "thus we may assume that @xmath382 consists of only one loop component @xmath383 .",
    "since @xmath383 itself bounds disks in @xmath368 on both sides , it must be an inessential loop on @xmath47 .",
    "we show that this case can be reduced to the case where @xmath368 satisfies the condition ( s1 ) . to this end , let @xmath393 $ ] be the height function such that @xmath394 is a 3-bridge sphere of @xmath0 when @xmath395 , that @xmath396 is a 2-sphere which meets each @xmath107 in one point when @xmath397 , that @xmath396 is a single point when @xmath398 and that @xmath396 is a 2-sphere in @xmath254 otherwise .",
    "moreover , we may assume that @xmath399 and that the restriction @xmath400 of @xmath71 to @xmath47 has at most one non - degenerate singular point at every level .",
    "thus , for every singular value @xmath401 , @xmath402 contains a maximal point , a minimal point or a saddle point .",

    "since @xmath409 cuts @xmath47 into a disk and a 1-holed torus , we may assume that @xmath410 is the disk .",
    "since @xmath411 , we see that @xmath412 contains an essential loop on @xmath47 .",
    "thus , there exists a singular value @xmath413 and a sufficiently small @xmath414 such that @xmath415 does not contain an essential loop on @xmath47 and @xmath416 contains an essential loop on @xmath47 .",
    "note that , if @xmath415 does not contain an essential loop on @xmath47 and the arc representing the singular point at @xmath417 is of type 2 or of type 3 , then @xmath416 can not contain an essential loop on @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the arc representing the singular point at @xmath417 must be of type 1 , and hence , @xmath418 contains a pair of parallel essential loops , say @xmath419 and @xmath420 , on @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath419 bounds a @xmath421-holed disk in @xmath422 disjoint from @xmath423 together with @xmath421 components @xmath424 of @xmath425 for some non - negative integer @xmath421 .",
    "we see that @xmath419 is null - homologous in @xmath36 for some @xmath108 since @xmath424 are inessential loops on @xmath47 .",
    "( by the choice of @xmath417 , all components of @xmath426 except @xmath419 and @xmath420 are inessential on @xmath47 . )",
    "hence , @xmath419 and @xmath420 must be meridian loops of one of the solid tori @xmath32 and @xmath53 .",
