    "outside the inner membrane ( i m ) of bacteria , peptidoglycan forms a covalently - linked mesh that accommodates continual growth while preserving cell - shape and integrity .",
    "the peptidoglycan ( pg ) sacculus of rod - shaped gram - negative ( g- ) bacteria such as _ escherichia coli _ is best understood , and is thought to be composed of approximately one layer of circumferential glycan strands connected by peptide cross - links @xcite .",
    "this thin mesh retains significant osmotic ( turgor ) pressures , ranging from @xmath0 kpa in growth medium to @xmath1 kpa in water @xcite .",
    "there is not yet a compelling model of how rod - shaped bacteria grow longer without growing wider  in order to accommodate a doubling of length before midcell division .",
    "the challenge is that the microscopic structure of the sacculus is disordered , with a broad range of glycan chain lengths that are much shorter than the bacterial circumference @xcite and significant disorder in their alignment visible under cryo - electronmicroscopy ( cryo - em ) @xcite .",
    "this appears to rule out straightforward templating mechanisms in which glycan hoops are copied to accommodate extension ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , recent experiments in both gram - positive ( g+ ) @xcite and g- @xcite bacteria indicates that pg synthesis drives local mreb patches circumferentially around rod - shaped bacteria .",
    "while such circumferential synthesis can explain rod - like elongation , the mechanism of the circumferential orientation remains unknown .",
    "we would expect that local disorder , due to distributions of glycan chain lengths @xcite and to variations in glycan chain orientation @xcite , leads to mesoscopic gaps in the pg sacculus .",

    "rod - shaped bacteria have strikingly anisotropic elasticity and loading .",
    "atomic - force microscopy ( afm ) of g- bacteria consistently obtains an approximately two - fold anisotropy in elastic constants @xcite , with the circumferential ( glycan - chain ) direction stiffer than the axial ( peptide - bond ) direction .",
    "there is also a two - fold anisotropy in the tension within the membrane of rod shaped cells due to their geometry combined with turgor pressure  with twice the tension in the circumferential direction @xcite .",
    "we expect that the anisotropic elasticity and loading would affect the stress concentration around gaps in the pg sacculus .",
    "in this paper we characterise necessary conditions for stable gap propagation due to stress - concentration within the context of an anisotropic elastic model of the pg sacculus .",
    "we find that stress concentration around observed gap sizes is not sufficient to mechanically rupture the pg with normal turgor pressures , and that large gap sizes will mechanically rupture the membrane @xcite before the pg",
    ". nevertheless , the stress - dependent `` smart autolysins '' proposed by koch @xcite could exploit the stress - concentration around pg gaps to propagate gaps without mechanical rupture . similarly , strain - dependent modulation of pg synthesis through the action of outer membrane lipoproteins has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "our results show that stress concentration around small gaps in the anisotropic pg sacculus could both localize and orient stress ( or strain)-sensitive pg degradation and synthesis .",

    ". it also remains to be addressed how pg synthesis could be directed behind gaps to prevent propagating gaps from lengthening .",
    "the recent discovery of outer membrane ( om ) lipoproteins that activate cell - wall synthesis @xcite provides a possible mechanism to couple stress and synthesis , at least for g- bacteria .",
    "gap size will determine a vertical bulge of the bacterial i m @xcite , which could then activate cell - wall synthesis through a transient kissing action of om lipoproteins .",
    "this `` hernia '' mechanism , first proposed in 1993 @xcite may also explain the patchy lipoprotein localization patterns seen in experiment @xcite .",
    "the coupling of mechanical forces and biological activity , generally called mechanobiology , can occur in many ways .",
    "recent experimental studies of externally stressed growing bacteria @xcite indicate that at least some mechanical modulation of cell - wall synthesis is taking place .",
    "our model highlights the potential importance of anisotropic elastic properties of the bacterial sacculus in the growth of rod - shaped bacteria . while the bacterial sacculus is an anisotropic material under anisotropic load , and exhibits anisotropic patterns of growth @xcite and fracture @xcite ,",
    "only one anisotropic parameter ( @xmath111 @xcite ) has been measured , and only for g- bacteria .",
    "we anticipate that the shear modulus @xmath20 , poisson s ratio @xmath35 , as well as non - orthotropic elastic parameters may affect our results , and therefore could be relevant to bacterial biology .",
    "a key parameter governing the stable directions of gap propagation is the toughness ratio @xmath58 , where larger values leads to circumferential propagation .",
    "however , we should interpret @xmath58 as a phenomenological parameter reflecting the effective coupling between anisotropic stress and local pg disruption , which may be challenging to measure directly .",
    "there have been two recent modelling approaches to rod - shaped bacterial elongation that can be usefully contrasted with our model .",
    "the most recent is the dislocation - driven model of amir and nelson @xcite .",
    "like us , they invoke the observed peptidoglycan disorder to infer the existence of defects .",
    "their dislocations are microscopic dislocations , corresponding to the ends of glycan chains , and they interact with each other through elastic stress fields .",
    "they are primarily interested in the interactions between multiple defects as they move around the sacculus .",
    "for simplicity , they work with an isotropic elastic model of the sacculus and build circumferential mobility of defects explicitly into their model .",
    "in contrast , our gaps are mesoscopic and as @xmath112 corresponds to two bound dislocations .",
    "we ignore interactions between gaps , but explicitly include measured anisotropic elasticity and so infer circumferential mobility .",
    "neither amir and nelson , nor us , include disorder in the elastic properties of the sacculus .",
    "in contrast , the microscopic spring approach of huang _",
    "et al _ @xcite has a self - consistent model of static but disordered peptidoglycan structure .",
    "this was extended @xcite to treat sacculus growth but with explicit circumferential glycan insertion .",
    "our approach complements both the dislocation model of amir and nelson and the spring model of huang _",
    "et al_. we show how an explicit anisotropic elasticity might lead to circumferential propagation , while this circumferential propagation is assumed in the other approaches @xcite .",
    "however , we focus on stress concentration around small gaps in the sacculus while amir and nelson consider dislocations . while we expect small gaps to exist in the sacculus to allow for periplasmic structures such as flagella @xcite , and they appear unavoidable with observed glycan strand - length distributions ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the important experimental question is whether gaps correlate with circumferentially propagating mreb patches @xcite .",
    "if so , this would support our gap extension picture .",
    "the emerging field of correlative microscopy @xcite , combining fluorescence microscopy with subsequent electron - tomography , may be able to resolve this question .",
    "since we have no microscopic disorder in our model , beyond the explicit introduction of gaps in the sacculus , we do not recover any dispersion of propagation directions around stable directions .",
    "as such , we can not compare with experimentally determined dispersions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that stable propagation is required for consistent orientation in the face of disorder .",
    "we capture both a stable circumferential regime and an adjacent bistable circumferential / longitudinal regime that we feel may explain the observed stable mreb patch propagation in both g+ @xcite and g- @xcite bacteria .",
    "we propose that the mreb patches are associated with small gaps in the pg , and are steered by stress - concentration in this anisotropic elastic system .",
