    "<S> these results suggest that while the classical system chooses one of the two stable branches ( which branch the system will choose may be unpredictable because of chaos ) , the quantum system can follow both the branches  simultaneously \" as a superposition of two coherent states corresponding to the two branches . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the kpo network can solve the ising problem via quantum adiabatic evolution .    to use a quantum adiabatic evolution for finding a configuration minimizing @xmath45 , the initial state @xmath31 should be the ground state of @xmath57 with @xmath35 . </S>",

    "<S> however , this causes no problem for the following two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , the transition between the two states is prohibited by the simultaneous parity symmetry of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the ground and first excited states have even and odd parities , respectively . ) </S>",
    "<S> second , even if the transition occurs by some accidental errors , we can find a solution correctly because the first excited state is also a superposition of @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( the same as @xmath72 except for a negative relative phase ) .    </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , in the quantum model , a superposition of the two local minima arises from quantum fluctuations , and finally the probability for the global minimum converges to unity via quantum adiabatic evolution [ fig . </S>",

    "<S> , we conclude that quantum superposition and quantum fluctuation work effectively to find optimal solutions in the present computation . </S>",
    "<S> ( a more detailed comparison between the two models may become a new theme in the field of quantum chaos , which is beyond the scope of the present work . )    in conclusion , we have proposed a quantum computer comprising quantum nonlinear oscillators exhibiting a quantum - mechanical bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum computer solves combinatorial optimization problems via quantum adiabatic evolution , where nonlinear terms are increased slowly . </S>",
    "<S> since this mechanism is different from that of conventional adiabatic quantum computation or quantum annealing , where quantum fluctuation terms are decreased slowly , we refer to the present approach as bifurcation - based adiabatic quantum computation . by simulating four - spin ising problems and comparing the results with those for a classical model </S>",
    "<S> , we have concluded that quantum superposition and quantum fluctuation work effectively to find optimal solutions . while conventional quantum computers with qubits and quantum gates @xcite are analogous to current digital computers with bits and logic gates , the present one is analogous to neural computers @xcite , which are also networks of nonlinear components . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the present scheme will lead to the emergence of a new paradigm , which may be called  quantum soft computing , \" in the fields of quantum information science , nonlinear science , and artificial intelligence . </S>"
