    "wireless communications at millimeter wave ( mmwave ) frequencies is one of the major proposals for fifth generation of mobile telephony .",
    "the major benefits coupled with mmwave frequencies is the large unused band ( 30 - 300 ghz ) where ltra ide and ( uwb ) channel setups could easily be realized at different center frequencies .",
    "additionally , higher carrier frequencies also allow design of compact antenna arrays with large number of antenna elements which increase the directional resolution of the system .",
    "both of the above mentioned features allow multi - gigabyte data rate communications at wireless links .",
    "+ very recently , realistic channel sounding campaign  @xcite at 2.4 ghz band focused at the spatial separation of multiple users in a densely populated scenario .",
    "measurements were taken with a circular shaped , dual polarized array with large number of antenna elements at the base station ( bs ) .",
    "results in  @xcite concluded that under the considered massive antenna setup at the bs , users in the cell can indeed be separated .",
    "this is quite intuitive as the dual antenna polarization and circular array geometry capture the multi - path components ( mpcs ) from distinct directions of arrivals ( doa ) which are spatially uncorrelated .",
    "these facts have been verified in  @xcite for centimeter wavelength frequencies . at the mmwave frequencies , measurement results in  @xcite",
    "show that mpcs arrive at the receiver from very few distinct directions known as spatial lobes .",
    "hence , the users located very close to each other will almost see the same channel which may lead to higher inter - user correlation .",
    "therefore , at mmwaves the topic of inter - user channel correlation is more interesting and needs thorough investigations .",
    "it is important to understand the impact of high directional and bandwidth resolution at the spatial separation among users . at the mmwave 60 ghz frequency band",
    ", authors in  @xcite have discussed the mutual orthogonality between the users as a function of inter user distance and the number of co - located users in an open square scenario . in another work",
    "@xcite , spatial separation of users has been discussed as a function of users probability to be in line of sight ( los ) to the bs .",
    "results have shown that user separation is difficult under the scenarios where the los probability is high .",
    "+ from system design perspective , it is well known that transmit precoding and effects of different snr levels also play a vital role in defining the spatial separation among users . from authors",
    "point of view , inter user orthogonality and the channel propagation parameters that define the degree of separation among the users yet needs to be extensively analyzed for different transmit precoding schemes and snr levels . in this paper , we have provided a deep insight of the sum rate analysis by changing the channel propagation parameters e.g , number of multipath clusters , number of bs antennas and bs antennas separation for indoor ( shopping mall ) scenario .",
    "we have used linear zero forcing ( zf ) precoder for the analysis of multi - user system .",
    "although linear digital precoding is not yet realized to be used at mmwave frequencies due to increased hardware complexity in context of required number of rf chains .",
    "therefore , hybrid ( analog+digital ) precoding techniques have received more attention among the wireless communications research community .",
    "these hybrid techniques have shown slight performance losses as compared to fully digital linear procodings .",
    "therefore , fully digital zf precoding just give us a performance upper bound and help to understand the behavior of the channel in a simplistic manner .",
    "additionally , we have used the model in  @xcite for the number of multipath clusters in the mmwave propagation channel .",
    "we have investigated the sum rate improvements if the count of multipath cluster is more than the number defined in model@xcite itself .",
    "consider a downlink multiuser mimo system with @xmath0 antennas mounted at the base station ( bs ) of height @xmath1 and @xmath2 be the number of mobile users ( mu ) each of height @xmath3 .",
    "all the users are closely located in the xy plane of the cartesian coordinate system inside a ring of radius @xmath4 as shown in fig .",
    "[ scenario ] .",
    "the position of users in the ring follows uniform random distribution .",
    "the heights of the bs and mu correspond to z - axis of the coordinate system .",
    "let @xmath5 be the number of multipath clusters with @xmath6 subpaths in each cluster . for simplicity , we assume single bounce multipath clusters .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be azimuth angle of arrival and departure of @xmath9 ray of the @xmath10 cluster respectively . similarly @xmath11 and @xmath12 correspond to the elevation angles of arrival and departure respectively .",
    "let @xmath13 be the number of antennas at each mu , then the channel matrix @xmath14 of a single user mimo link can be written as @xmath15 where ,    * @xmath16 is the channel impulse response matrix of the los component arriving at delay @xmath17 . *",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the transmit and receive antenna array steering vectors .",
    "* @xmath20 is the impulse response at the delay tap @xmath21 of the @xmath9 ray of the @xmath10 cluster . *",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the complex channel gain and attenuation loss of the @xmath9 ray of the @xmath10 cluster respectively .    since each subpath may have different scattering conditions so the subpath phases can be considered as independent identical distribution .",
    "we have assumed constant distance between the antenna array and all the scatterers which belong to the same cluster to simplify the model .",
    "let @xmath24 be the propagation distance between bs and mu via the central ray of the @xmath10 cluster .",
    "the propagation distance of subpaths associated to the @xmath10 cluster is geometrically computed as @xmath25 for the attenuation of the link , we have used the same model proposed in  @xcite @xmath26\\log_{10}\\left ( r_{i , l } \\right ) -x_{\\sigma }   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the path loss exponent , @xmath28 is a system parameter , @xmath29 is the fixed reference frequency ( the centroid of all frequencies represented by the path loss model ) .",

    "it can also be observed that increase in the sum rate is more significant for 10 users .",

    "shows that the sum rate of ten users is significantly higher as compared to two and five users .",
    "this is due to higher multiplexing gains at high snr regime . the analysis of channel condition number @xmath63 from fig .",
    "[ usersclustdeflambdef ] shows that the cdf of two users is more closer to @xmath64 which shows singular value spread is lower for 2 users as compared to 5 and 10 users where it is high enough .",
    "it indicates that the channel correlation among users increases by increasing the number of users so the spatial separation among the users becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "hence , the _ channel hardening _",
    "assumption is increasingly violated with increasing number of users in the ring .",
    "channel hardening refers to the phenomenon where the off - diagonal terms of the @xmath65 matrix become increasingly weaker compared to the diagonal terms as the size of the channel gain matrix @xmath66 increases @xcite .",
    "+ it is generally assumed that with large number of antenna elements at the bs increases the channel hardening factor so that the low complexity match filtering precoder i.e. @xmath67 becomes optimal .",
    "mathematically , it means that @xmath68 is an identity matrix . however , high correlation in fig .",
    "[ usersclustdeflambdef ] shows that @xmath67 may not result in identity matrix that makes match filtering sub - optimal .",
    "so , one can use other linear but relatively more computationally complex precoding schemes such as zero forcing ( zf ) or minimum mean square error ( mmse ) techniques in conjunction with multiuser selection .",
    "user selection techniques are well understood to be an effective way to reduce the computational complexity of the system . while optimal user selection is a np - hard @xcite problem and requires exhaustive search over all possible user combinations .",
    "therefore , sub - optimal greedy incremental and decremental selection strategies are widely used .",
    "+ the linear gain in channel capacity by increasing the number of antennas depends upon the snr scaling and the number of scattering points in the channel . increased number of scatterers give rise to the higher number of multipath components .",
    "therefore , leading towards multipath diversity which in turn results in increased channel capacity . in general , at lower frequencies ( @xmath69 ghz )",
    ", the famous 3gpp channel models e.g. winner / scm @xcite assume that resolvable multipath components are composed of 20 sub - paths so that central limit theorem holds and the amplitude fading of the resolvable paths follows the rayleigh distribution . if the number of multipath components are such high then off - course the high spatial resolution associated with large number of antenna elements in the array may explore more scattering points in the channel and hence may increase the channel capacity .",
    "however , on the other hand mmwave channels could be sparse due to higher propagation and penetration losses from the different objects in the channel .",
    "therefore , it is quite likely that under certain scenarios the number of antenna elements in the mimo array is larger than the number of resolvable multipath components .",
    "in such scenarios , further increase in the antenna elements may not result in linear gain in the channel capacity and in the worst case it could be bottlenecked .",
    "[ nbsdefclusterdefspacingsnr0db ] shows the cdf analysis of the sum rate by changing the number of bs antennas from @xmath70 upa ( 40 antennas ) to @xmath71 upa ( 160 antennas ) for two , five and ten users at 0 db snr .",
    "the sum rate of two users is higher than five and ten users because the multiplexing gain is negligible at 0 db .",
    "however , the change in sum rate is significant for ten users as compared to five and two users by increasing the bs antennas due to exploration of more multipath for more users . the results from fig .",

    "high snr , increasing bs antennas gives rise to multiplexing gain .",
    "+ the separation between the antenna elements explains the channel correlation properties and the exploration of the number of scatterers .",
    "when antenna elements are very close to each other , the channel correlation will be very high and the interference among the users will increase . from fig .",
    "[ spacingnbs160defclustringsnr0db ] , we can see that increasing inter element distance ( ied ) at bs results more change in sum rate for ten users because of reduction in channel correlation .",
    "however , from fig .",
    "[ spacingnbs160defclustringsnr0db ] at 0 db snr , one can see that the even by increasing the ied the sum rate of ten users is significantly lower than five and two users because the diversity gain is high in case of two and five users as compared to ten users .",

    "results show that the mmwave frequencies channels are correlated in space and it is hard to spatially separate users in the dense cellular networks .",
