    "interfaces of magnetic materials with normal metals and superconductors have attracted much attention in recent years because they can strongly influence properties of mesoscopic and nanoscopic systems , and may play important role in compounds with competing magnetic and superconducting ordering .",
    "hybrid superconducting systems involving ferro- and/or antiferromagnets manifest unusual properties associated with spin and orbital effects , and are of both fundamental interest and important for technological applications .",
    "ferromagnetic layers can spin polarize quasiparticle currents and zeeman split surface densities of states , with possible applications in spintronics @xcite .",
    "superconductor - ferromagnet -superconductor ( sc / f / sc ) junctions have been shown to display @xmath2 transitions with varying temperature , width , or orientational structure of the magnetization of the ferromagnetic interlayer @xcite .",
    "there are also many situations of fundamental and practical interest which involve interfaces with antiferromagnets .",
    "in particular , many of the properties of high - temperature superconducting ( hts ) cuprate materials are thought to result from a competition between antiferromagnetic and superconducting order , and there are many naturally occurring situations and possible devices which might involve such boundaries .",
    "these include interfaces of insulating and highly doped cuprates or superconductor - antiferromagnet - superconductor ( sc / af / sc ) junctions@xcite , hts grain boundaries@xcite where antiferromagnetism may play a role as a surface state , and the antiferromagnetism which has been observed in hts vortex cores @xcite . at the same time , there exist only very preliminary results of experimental and theoretical investigations of proximity and josephson effects through various types of antiferromagnetic interfaces @xcite .",
    "below we study theoretically interfaces between itinerant antiferromagnets and normal metals or superconductors .",
    "itinerant antiferromagnets like chromium and its alloys @xcite are metals above the nel temperature . in the antiferromagnetic phase",
    ", however , an energy gap in the quasiparticle spectrum arises either on the whole fermi surface or on parts of it .",
    "similar properties are also manifested in mott antiferromagnets , in particular undoped cuprates .",
    "since they possess strong correlations due to large on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath3 , the mean - field approach of the present paper can not be applied quantitatively to mott systems , whereas it applies well to itinerant antiferromagnets with comparatively small @xmath3 .",
    "we expect , however , that our main conclusions regarding af / s and af / n interfaces can be qualitatively applied also to interfaces with mott antiferromagnets because they are based largely on symmetry properties and general characteristics of antiferromagnets like the doubling of period , nesting conditions and the wave vector of the antiferromagnetic pattern . in itinerant antiferromagnets , the energy gap in the quasiparticle spectrum",
    "is determined by the antiferromagnetic order parameter , i.e. the sublattice electronic magnetization @xmath4 .",
    "this applies both to commensurate antiferromagnetic phases and to phases with spin - density waves @xcite , and is reminiscent of the situation in superconductors , where the energy gap is determined by the superconducting order parameter @xmath5 .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated theoretically that a new spin - dependent channel of quasiparticle reflection , the so - called @xmath6 reflection , takes place at interfaces between itinerant antiferromagnets and normal metals or superconductors @xcite .",
    "parallel to the interface , the momentum component of low - energy normal - metal quasiparticles changes by a wave - vector @xmath7 in a @xmath6 reflection event , where @xmath8 is the wave - vector of the antiferromagnetic pattern . assuming small fermi velocity mismatches and taking into account the nesting condition @xmath9 in itinerant antiferromagnets",
    ", one can see that a normal - metal quasiparticle changes its total momentum by @xmath8 and the respective velocity changes its sign in a @xmath6 reflection event . hence , normal - metal quasiparticles with energies less than or comparable to the antiferromagnetic gap experience spin - dependent retroreflection at antiferromagnet - normal metal ( af",
    "/ n ) transparent interfaces . furthermore , @xmath6 reflection processes generate quasiparticle bound states below the af gap in af / n / af junctions , analogously to the case of subgap states in sc / n / sc systems formed by andreev reflection .",
    "the af / n / af bound states arise from a coherent superposition of electrons with momenta @xmath10 and @xmath11 and almost opposite velocities .",
    "subgap states arise also at af / sc interfaces as a combined effect of andreev and @xmath6 reflections . among a variety of subgap states , low - energy states with energies @xmath12 are of special interest since they can result in low - temperature anomalies in the josephson critical current , as well as low - bias anomalies in the conductance .",
    "low - energy quasiparticle interface states were also predicted to occur on antiferromagnetic - @xmath0-wave superconductor ( af / ssc ) interfaces in the absence of specular reflection , when one can disregard effects of interface potential barriers and fermi velocity mismatches . for an ssc / af / ssc junction ,",
    "these bound states are split due to a finite width of the af interlayer and carry the supercurrent . at af",
    "/ dsc interfaces , low - energy bound states @xmath12 do not exist , at least if the order parameters are small compared with the hopping matrix element ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is contrary to the case of a ( 110 ) surface of a dsc confined with impenetrable potential wall where zero - energy surface andreev states are formed @xcite .",
    "below , we extend the study of effects of @xmath6 reflection processes based on self - consistent solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "this goes beyond the framework of the preceding paper @xcite . in general",
    ", we find excellent agreement with the results by bobkova _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the more general approach of the present paper allows us to study several important new problems .",
    "in particular , we discuss the effects of interface potentials on the dispersive quasiparticle interface states and the ldos . in the presence of potential barriers and fermi velocity mismatches , there exists an interplay of specular and @xmath6 reflections .",
    "we demonstrate that potential barriers on interfaces between af and either @xmath0-wave or @xmath1-wave superconductors can result in new extrema in dispersive quasiparticle spectra and additional associated peaks in the ldos .",
    "we also find new interface quasiparticle states with subgap energies near the edge of the continuum , which arise due to self - consistent suppression of the order parameters near the interface . by studying effects of interface pair breaking at af / sc interfaces",
    ", we find that for the ( 110 ) orientation the self - consistent suppression of both antiferromagnetic and superconducting order parameters near the interface is accompanied by even - odd spatial oscillations .",
    "we show that discrete quasiparticle dispersive levels in af - n - af systems strongly depend on the relative orientation of the magnetizations in the two antiferromagnets .",
    "effects of the misorientation angle turn out to be analogous to the influence of the phase difference on the discrete quasiparticle spectrum in sc - n - sc systems",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the microscopic model used to study various interfaces with antiferromagnets , the bdg equations with a mean - field treatment of both magnetism and superconductivity general enough to study both @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave pairing symmetry , as well as various interface potentials . in section iii , we sketch the derivation of the associated quasiclassical ( andreev ) equations , complemented with boundary conditions , by assuming slow spatial variations of both order parameters . in section iv , we study quasiparticle states at ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) interfaces of both @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave superconductors with antiferromagnets , and compare the results of numerical evaluations of the bdg equations with the predictions of the quasiclassical theory .",
    "we end section iv by showing how the bound state energies can be obtained within a transfer matrix formalism . in section",
    "v , we study the af / n / af junction , and discuss a novel  spin-@xmath14 \" configuration where the relative phase of the staggered magnetization on both sides of the junction can tune the energy of the interface bound states .",
    "conclusions and perspectives for future work are presented in section vi .",

    "we choose a coordinate system where @xmath32 and @xmath33 describe coordinates perpendicular and parallel to the interface , respectively .",
    "for a ( 100 ) interface the @xmath32 and @xmath33 axes coincide with the crystal axes @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "ordering , this should be done by taking into account magnetic crystal symmetry along the boundary .",
    "in particular , the magnetic order parameter @xmath57 oscillates rapidly along the ( 100 ) interface and results in a doubling of the period along the @xmath33-axis .",

    "the factors @xmath77 arise in the nonlocal terms in eqs.([bdg1_ky_100 ] ) , ( [ bdg2_ky_100 ] ) since for the ( 100 ) interface orientation , in accordance with the definitions above , the @xmath33 coordinate of the site @xmath59 is always less by @xmath29 than the coordinate of site @xmath58 in the same cell .    for the ( 110 ) orientation ,",

    "all order parameters are presumed to be identical on links ( or sites ) which can be obtained from each other by magnetic translations along the interface or interlayer .",

    "we will base our numerical calculations on the one - dimensional bogoliubov - de gennes equations formulated above , as well as on the corresponding self - consistency equations .",
    "for an analytical study of superconducting interfaces and junctions involving itinerant antiferromagnets , we present in this section the quasiclassical approach developed in ref . .",
    "as is well known , the quasiclassical theory describes physical quantities which vary slowly in space compared to the atomic scale , and assumes characteristic energies to be much less than the fermi energy @xmath101 .",
    "we consider below two types of superconductor - antiferromagnet hybrid systems to which the quasiclassical approach applies to a different extent .",

    "hence , one can use quasiclassical equations both for superconducting and antiferromagnetic phases and match them at the interface if they are formulated separately for each sublattice .",
    "sublattice equations are coupled with each other via nonlocal terms which contain , for example , hopping matrix elements or @xmath1-wave superconducting order parameter fields . in total , this gives us twice the usual number of coupled quasiclassical equations .",
    "another possible formulation of the quasiclassical approach to the first type of superconductor - itinerant antiferromagnet hybrid systems is not based on the sublattice representation .",
    "instead , one can formulate equations for quasiparticle trajectories , taking into account that the rapidly oscillating antiferromagnetic order parameter @xmath104 couples equations for two trajectories , one for a quasiparticle momentum @xmath105 and the other for @xmath106 .",
    "the approach based on this @xmath107 representation results also in twice the number of quasiclassical equations .",
    "there are no further coupled trajectories , since @xmath108 is assumed to be the reciprocal vector of the nonmagnetic crystal due to the nesting condition .    in the second type of hybrid superconductor - antiferromagnet systems , only the superconducting order parameter satisfies the condition @xmath109 and can be safely described with the quasiclassical equations .",
    "the antiferromagnetic order parameter is taken sufficiently large @xmath110 ( one could also assume @xmath111 within the framework of the approach , if this were relevant ) .",
    "then the effect of the antiferromagnet on the superconductor can be taken into account entirely via modified boundary conditions , which complement quasiclassical equations at abrupt superconductor - antiferromagnetic interfaces .",
    "we begin with the derivation of andreev equations in the sublattice representation .",
    "assume for this purpose that the solution of the bdg equations ( [ bdg1_ky_100])-([bdg2_ky_100 ] ) and ( [ bdg1_ky_110])-([bdg2_ky_110 ] ) can be represented as the following product of rapidly oscillating exponents and a slowly varying andreev amplitude : @xmath112 here , @xmath113 is the @xmath32 component of the quasiparticle momentum on the fermi surface , measured in units of @xmath36 .",

    "<S> we present a detailed theoretical investigation of interfaces and junctions involving itinerant antiferromagnets . by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations with a tight - binding model on a square lattice , we study both the self - consistent order parameter fields proximate to interfaces between antiferromagnets ( af ) and @xmath0-wave ( ssc ) or @xmath1-wave ( dsc ) superconductors , the dispersion of quasiparticle subgap states at interfaces and interlayers , and the local density of states ( ldos ) as a function of distance from the interface . in addition , we present the quasiclassical approach to interfaces and junctions involving itinerant antiferromagnets developed in an earlier paper . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results are in excellent agreement with what we obtain numerically </S>",
    "<S> . strong effects of pair breaking in the presence of low - energy interface andreev states are found in particular for af / ssc interfaces when interface potentials are not too high . </S>",
    "<S> potential barriers induce additional extrema in the dispersive quasiparticle spectra with corresponding peaks in the ldos . </S>",
    "<S> discrete quasiparticle dispersive levels in af - normal metal ( n ) - af systems are found to strongly depend on the misorientation angle of the magnetizations in the two antiferromagnets . </S>"
