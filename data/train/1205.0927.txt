    "energy consumption is a key issue in the deployment of _ green wireless _ communication networks @xcite .",
    "currently , there is a marked increase in the number of multimedia functionalities available at the mobile terminal that require ever higher transmission rates .",
    "this , together with the large screen size of mobile terminals , directly translates into a higher power consumption . on the network side",
    ", the energy - efficiency depends , among other things , on the power transmitted at the base station .",
    "higher transmission rates require more base stations to cope with the increase in data traffic .",
    "however , the gains resulting from heavy cell splitting tend to be severely limited by high inter - cell interference .",
    "moreover , high capex ( capital expenditures ) as well as high opex ( operating expenditures ) associated with high power macro nodes further limits the usefulness of such an approach @xcite .    within this context , the introduction of the multiple - input multiple - output",
    "( mimo ) concept has become instrumental to achieve high spectral and energy - efficiencies @xcite .",
    "mimo employs multiple antenna elements at both the transmitter and the receiver and has attracted extensive attention due to the potential manifold increase in performance it can bring to standardized wireless communication networks , such as , the umts / lte / lte - a , wimax and wifi systems as well as systems beyond these .",
    "indeed , the multiple antennas can be exploited by creating a highly effective _ antenna diversity _ system which combats the effects of fading so as to improve the average signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) or , by _ spatial multiplexing _ of the transmit data , i.e. , the data streams are spatially separated by the multiple antennas at the receiver and the transmitter @xcite .    the energy - efficiency analysis of mimo systems has attracted the attention of the communication research community lately . a survey on energy - efficient communications",
    "can be found in @xcite . as outlined there",
    ", two main research approaches can be identified:(1 ) the _ pragmatic approach _ , which focuses on system specific features such as modulation and coding - decoding schemes as well as electronics and , ( 2 ) the _ information - theoretic approach _ , which focuses on the maximization of channel capacity per unit cost function .",
    "the latter approach has been considered in @xcite where the energy - efficiency is defined as the ratio between the transmission rate and the transmit power .",
    "they show that the optimum energy - efficiency is obtained for transmit power that tends to zero for static and fast - varying mimo channels with informed transmitter and receiver .",
    "this result illustrates the fact that according to the provided energy - efficiency definition the maximum is achieved by transmitting at very low powers . at the same time this requires the system to support very low data rates as , for example , in sensor - networks",
    "however , as they noted in @xcite , this is not a practical result for communication systems where a given data rate is required for satisfactory operation of the wireless network .",
    "hence , a different strategy is required to obtain a non - trivial solution to the energy - efficient communication over mimo wireless channels .",
    "this is what we investigate in this article .",
    "the solution we have found is based on the following observations .",
    "firstly , limiting the maximum _ total transmit power _ while maximizing the energy - efficiency , as we have seen , is not worthwhile .",
    "secondly , we find that the transmit power can still be constrained , though indirectly , by imposing a constraint on the _ total receive power_. this constraint is justified by the fact , that there is a minimum power level ( or signal - to - noise ratio ) required at the receiver for a satisfactory operation of the communication link . below this minimum level , which corresponds to the receiver sensitivity",
    ", the transmit signals can not be decoded properly which leads to unwanted performance degradation .",
    "it turns out that this minimum receive power constraint can be used to obtain the power allocation for a mimo channel that maximizes energy - efficiency .    in this paper",
    "we adhere to the information - theoretic approach outlined in @xcite and find the optimal strategy for energy - efficient transition satisfying a total receive power requirement .",
    "we specialize our analysis to the static and the fast - varying single - user mimo channels leaving the slow varying mimo channel to be considered elsewhere .",
    "we also assume that channel state information is available at both the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized below :    * we derive a energy - efficient water - filling ( eewf ) algorithm that maximizes the ratio of the transmission rate to the total transmit power under total receive power constraint .",
    "this is a novel approach and differs from the customary total transmit power constraint that gives the trivial zero power result @xcite .",
    "* we show that the static isotropic and the static rank-1 mimo channels achieve the shannon capacity if they are power efficient in the sense of the eewf power allocation algorithm .",
    "this is obtained under the assumption of equality of the signal - to - noise ratios used in the eewf and water - filling ( wf ) . here",
    "we show that while the optimum transmit power goes to zero as the number of antennas increases , the transmission rate also increases but to a limit defined by the minimum total received power and the noise variance . *",
    "we show that static siso channels also achieve the shannon capacity under the conditions given above ; however , for the rayleigh fading siso channel this is only observed in the high signal - to - noise ratio limit .",
    "* we derive an upper and a lower bound for the ratio between energy - efficiency corresponding to the eewf and the wf power allocations as well as the ratio of the transmission rate corresponding to the eewf and the shannon siso capacity under the assumption of finite inverse transmit power . *",
    "we illustrate for rayleigh fading mimo channels , based on monte carlo simulations , that the energy - efficiency provided by the eewf algorithm can be more than an order of magnitude greater than the energy - efficiency corresponding to capacity achieving water - filling ( wf ) algorithm ; while the corresponding total transmit power decreases with the number of antennas .",
    "the input - output relationship for a mimo communication system with @xmath0 transmit antennas and @xmath1 receive antennas can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the received signal vector , @xmath4 is the transmit signal vector , @xmath5 is the mimo channel matrix and @xmath6 is the noise ( awgn ) vector with covariance matrix @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the noise variance , @xmath9 denotes expectation and @xmath10 denotes the hermitian transpose operation .",
    "we define the _ total transmit power _ as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the covariance matrix of the transmit vector and @xmath13 denotes trace operation which is the sum of the diagonal elements of matrix @xmath14 .",
    "the _ _ total receive power _ _ is obtained by fixing the channel matrix @xmath15 and is defined for the noiseless case as @xmath16    as shown in @xcite , can be transformed into a stream of @xmath17 parallel channels as follows @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 are unitary and @xmath24 is non - negative and diagonal containing the singular values of the mimo channel matrix , i.e. @xmath25 hence , the transmission rate of the mimo channel equals the transmission rate of the original channel due to the unitary affine transformation and is given by @xmath26 we measure the energy - efficiency as the ratio between the transmission rate and the transmit power ( bps / hz / watt)@xcite .",
    "hence , we divide by and obtain @xmath27    we now formulate our energy - efficiency maximization problem with constrained receive power as follows @xmath28 where we have used with @xmath29 to get the constraint , @xmath30 is the minimum power required at the receiver and we use the mimo channel power normalization @xmath31 .    we further specialize our analysis to the case of equal number of transmit and receive antennas , i.e. , @xmath32 .    recalling that the rate is maximized for independent gaussian zero - mean complex",
    "transmit signal vector @xmath33 with diagonal transmit covariance matrix @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the power allocated to channel @xmath36 .",
    "we can now recast and into the following form @xmath37 where the power channel normalization is @xmath38 .",
    "the optimal transmit powers @xmath39 can now be obtained by solving a nonlinear programming ( nlp ) optimization problem defined by and .",
    "the solution must satisfy the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions @xcite .",
    "we first construct the cost function containing the lagrange multipliers @xmath40 for the inequality constraints and a multiplier @xmath41 for the equality condition @xmath42 the kkt conditions that maximize are @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the gradient operator .",
    "thus , we get from that @xmath45 noticing that the constraint @xmath46 need not be tight we can eliminate the constants @xmath47 since they act as slack variables .",
    "hence , from and we get @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 have been defined above @xmath53 . if @xmath54 then holds if @xmath55 .",
    "hence , we get from , and that @xmath56 . now , if @xmath57 then @xmath58 since @xmath55 can not satisfy and at the same time .",
    "we further see that @xmath59 , i.e. , this constraint is tight which leads to @xmath60 from .",
    "we have proved the following proposition .    * * consider the energy - efficiency of mimo communication systems operating over a static awgn channel and constrained minimum total received power defined according to and .",
    "then , for informed transmitter and receiver the optimum is achieved by a `` water - filling '' power allocation solution @xmath61 with per - channel variable power levels according to @xmath62 where @xmath63 is chosen to meet the receive power constraint , @xmath49 is the maximum energy - efficiency and @xmath64 and @xmath50 are the corresponding transmission rate and transmit power , respectively .",
    "the summation is over @xmath65 channels since the number of actual channels satisfying and may be less than or equal to @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 denotes @xmath68 and @xmath69 denotes the natural logarithm .    as we can see ,",
    "the optimization problem at hand involves finding @xmath61 , @xmath49 and @xmath41 .",
    "finding @xmath41 from leads to finding the roots of a polynomial of at most degree @xmath70 in @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , the solution is given by the largest positive real root as we show in appendix a.    it is worthwhile to note that the transmission rate corresponding to the maximum energy - efficiency always satisfies @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the channel capacity of the static channel achieved by the water - filling ( wf ) algorithm , @xcite . in order to be able to compare different power allocation strategies we need to define a common reference .",
    "in our case we use the transmit signal - to - noise power @xmath73 .    *",
    "* the static siso channel achieves the shannon capacity if it is energy - efficient in the sense of proposition 1 and it satisfies the condition of equal transmit signal - to - noise ratio such that @xmath74 , where , @xmath75 is the channel gain .",
    "the above result is straightforward .",
    "indeed , set @xmath76 into - and compare it with the capacity of the awgn siso channel @xcite for the same transmit signal - to - noise ratio @xmath77 .",
    "we see then that the eewf power allocation policy(clearly there is only one channel ) gives @xmath78 .",
    "hence , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . on the other hand ,",
    "the siso channel capacity is given by @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "hence , @xmath85 .",
    "hence , @xmath86 when @xmath74 .",
    "this result has the following interpretation ( static siso case ) : if the transmit and receive power constraints satisfy @xmath74 , then an increase or decrease of the transmit power will proportionally affect the optimum power allocation into the single link .",
    "this is not true for the general mimo case , since the optimal power allocation in the sense of proposition 1 and that achieving the mimo capacity are not equivalent .",
    "next we exemplify this latter statement by specializing our results to two special cases .",
    "we also look at their asymptotic behavior .    *",
    "_ example 1 : the isotropic static mimo channel . _ *    under the isotropy assumption of the static channel all the eigenvalues of the mimo channel matrix are equal .",
    "hence , the normalization @xmath38 gives @xmath87 for @xmath88 . by further substitution into - ,",
    "we readily obtain the optimal transmit power allocation per channel that achieve maximum energy - efficiency and the corresponding total transmit power and transmission rate : @xmath89 now compare the above with the capacity achieving strategy ( wf ) for the isotropic static mimo channel with transmit power constraint @xmath90 , @xcite .",
    "we have then that @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "hence , we see that energy - efficient channel also achieves the shannon capacity under certain conditions as stated in the following result .    * * the isotropic static mimo channel achieves the shannon capacity if it is energy - efficient in the sense of proposition 1 and it satisfies the conditions of equal transmit signal - to - noise ratio and equal number of antennas such that @xmath95 .    * * a energy - efficient , in the sense of proposition 1 , isotropic static mimo channel with a large number of antennas behaves as follows @xmath96 as we can see , the energy - efficiency increases asymptotically to infinity while the corresponding transmit power goes to zero and the transmit rate goes to a maximum limiting value .",
    "the physical interpretation is that if we constrain the receive power to a certain level , then the energy - efficiency will increase as we increase the number of antennas while the needed transmit power will decrease accordingly .    * _ example 2 : the rank-1 static mimo channel . _ *    under the rank-@xmath97 assumption of the static channel , all the eigenvalues of the mimo channel matrix but one are equal zero",
    ". hence , the normalization @xmath38 gives @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "further substitution into - gives the following results @xmath101    * * the rank-1 static mimo channel achieves the shannon capacity if it is energy - efficient in the sense of proposition 1 and it satisfies the conditions of equal transmit signal - to - noise ratio and equal number of antennas such that @xmath102 .",
    "this result follows by noticing that the capacity achieving strategy for the rank-1 static mimo channel with transmit power constraint @xmath90 @xcite , is equivalent to the transmission rate and transmit power that corresponds to the maximum energy - efficiency and satisfying conditions above .",
    "indeed , we have for the capacity achieving strategy that @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath100 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .    * * a energy - efficient , in the sense of proposition 1 , rank-1 static mimo channel with a large number of antennas behaves as follows @xmath108 as we can see , the energy - efficiency increases asymptotically to infinity at the same time as the corresponding transmit power goes to zero and the transmit rate remains constant and equal to the capacity of the siso channel and is independent of the number of antennas .",
    "we now consider a channel that undergoes rapid fading variations and is ergodic under the transmission duration .",
    "we further assume that the elements of the channel matrix @xmath15 in are now i.i.d .",
    "zero - mean complex gaussian variables , i.e. , the channel is rayleigh fading .    we analyze the energy - efficiency of a time - varying ergodic mimo channel as the maximization of the instantaneous energy - efficiency given by with an instantaneous constraint on the total receive power .",
    "the latter basically defines a power control constraint on the link .",
    "hence , we define the corresponding optimization problem as follows @xmath109 where the expectation @xmath9 is taken over the realization of @xmath51 and the maximization is over @xmath61 .",
    "the power channel normalization is @xmath110 .",
    "we can now construct a cost function and kkt conditions similar to and - , respectively .",
    "we enforce this conditions on the instantaneous realizations of @xmath51 and @xmath61 . clearly ,",
    "we seek find the instantaneous @xmath61 that maximizes the function within the expectation brackets in then we obtain the expected maximum value .",
    "it should be noted that in general @xmath111 .",
    "* * consider the instantaneous energy - efficiency of mimo communication systems operating over ergodic time - varying i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh channels with informed transmitter and receiver , and with instantaneous total receive power constraint .",
    "then , the instantaneous maximum is achieved by the energy - efficient water - filling ( eewf ) power allocation solution with per - channel variable power levels according to proposition 1 .",
    "the expected optimum energy - efficiency , the corresponding transmission rate and the total transmit power are given by @xmath112    where @xmath49 is the maximum of the instantaneous energy - efficiency and @xmath64 and @xmath50 are the corresponding instantaneous transmission rate and transmit power , respectively .",
    "the power allocation is performed dynamically , i.e. , as per channel realization , according to a given total receive power constraint .",
    "this result is straightforward and follows from proposition 1 above .",
    "in addition to we also consider the average of the number of transmission channels @xmath113    the transmission rate corresponding to the maximum energy - efficiency always satisfies @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the ergodic channel capacity of the time - varying i.i.d .",
    "gaussian channel @xcite .    the power efficiency criteria with total receive power constraint for the siso channel implies channel inversion .",
    "hence , the condition for signal - to - noise ratio equality becomes @xmath116 ( observe that in general @xmath117 ) . for the time - varying siso channel",
    "it can be shown that @xmath118 .",
    "however , the dynamic range of realistic channels is seldom as low as null and is often only a few tens or hundreds times larger than the sample average .",
    "moreover , a better form of power control is obtained by only compensating for fading above a certain cutoff fade depth known as truncated channel inversion @xcite .",
    "so we will assume that @xmath119 for our rayleigh fading channels .",
    "* * consider a energy - efficient in the sense of proposition 2 time - varying siso channel .",
    "then , the ratio between the transmission rate corresponding to the energy - efficient transmission @xmath120 and the ergodic siso capacity @xmath115 satisfy the inequalities @xmath121    the corresponding bounds for the ratio between the optimum siso energy - efficiency @xmath122 and the energy - efficiency corresponding to the capacity achieving case @xmath123 are @xmath124 where we have assumed equal transmit signal - to - noise ratio such that @xmath116 , @xmath119 and @xmath125 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds in and are achieved at the high and low signal - to - noise ratio regimes , respectively .",
    "the derivations are given in appendix b.    it is worthwhile to note that if we have an ideal siso rayleigh channel then @xmath126 and the ( average ) total transmit power will therefore also increase infinitely @xmath127 .",
    "in this section we present numerical computations that illustrate the dependence of the average of the optimal energy - efficiency on the signal - to - noise ratio and the number of antennas according to proposition 2 above .",
    "we base our computations on @xmath128 realizations of the entries of the mimo channel matrix @xmath15 generated according to the assumption of i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh fading .",
    "equal number of receive and transmit antennas @xmath66 has been assumed with channel normalization @xmath129 .",
    "the average signal - to - noise ratio is defined as @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the average transmit power .    throughout the ( a)-plots , from figure  [ f1 ] to figure  [ f4 ] , we use the following labeling .",
    "the continuous lines represent the optimum energy - efficiency solution , i.e. , the eewf algorithm with total receive power constraint @xmath132 , while the dashed lines correspond to the power allocation achieving the ergodic mimo capacity , i.e. , the wf algorithm with total receive power constraint @xmath133 .",
    "furthermore , in figure  [ f1](a ) , figure  [ f2](a ) and figure  [ f4](a ) the different curves correspond to a different number of antennas @xmath134 going from the bottom to the top of the plot in increasing order . in figure",
    "[ f3](a ) the different curves also correspond to a different number of antennas but instead the count is going from the top to the bottom of the plot in increasing order . in figure  [ f1](b ) , figure  [ f2](b ) and figure  [ f4](b ) the different curves correspond to different signal - to - noise ratios @xmath135 db also here going from the bottom to the top in increasing order .",
    "figure  [ f1](a ) and figure  [ f1](b ) show the energy - efficiency @xmath122 as a function of @xmath136 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "as we can see , the energy - efficiency increases as a function of both @xmath136 and @xmath66 . increasing the number of antennas at a fixed @xmath136 results in a larger energy - efficiency as compared to increasing the signal - to - noise ratio at a fixed @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , the energy - efficiency corresponding to the eewf algorithm can be more than an order of magnitude greater than the energy - efficiency corresponding to the ergodic channel capacity .",
    "for example , in figure  [ f1](a ) , compare the top continuous line ( eewf ) with the top dashed line ( wf ) for let s say @xmath137 db ; in both cases @xmath138 .",
    "however , for the siso case , the energy - efficiency corresponding to the wf power allocation is larger than the eewf power allocation , which is contrary to the statement of proposition 2 and more specifically of corollary 2.1 . indeed",
    ", as we mentioned above , we have assumed that @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "hence , they do not satisfy one of the conditions of corollary 2.1 since @xmath139 . in this case",
    "we have that @xmath140 .",
    "this follows from as shown in appendix b , where we have assumed @xmath132 for the energy - efficiency maximization and @xmath133 for the system capacity calculation .",
    "hence , the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath141 is given by @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively .",
    "for the mimo case , i.e. , @xmath144 , the optimality of the eewf power allocation comes at the expense of being suboptimal in terms of transmission rate .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ f2](a ) and figure  [ f2](b ) where the average transmission rate @xmath120 is plotted as a function of @xmath136 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines denote the ergodic mimo capacity .",
    "as expected , the transmission rate corresponding to the eewf algorithm is bounded from above by the channel capacity .",
    "the difference increases with both the number of antennas and the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the latter means that the total transmit power corresponding to the eewf must be lesser than or equal to the total transmit power corresponding to the wf .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ f3](a ) and figure  [ f3](b ) , where the total transmit power @xmath131 is shown as a function of @xmath136 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "on one hand , it follows from figure  [ f3](a ) that the total transmit power obtained does not depend on the @xmath136 . on the other hand , the total transmit power corresponding to the eewf decreases with the number of antennas while the total receive power is fixed .",
    "obviously , the total transmit power corresponding to wf shall not change with the number of antennas since it is a given constraint .",
    "figure  [ f4](a ) and figure  [ f4](b ) show the average number of transmission channels @xmath145 as a function of @xmath136 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "as we can see , the number of transmission channels used by the eewf approaches asymptotically the actual number of antennas as the signal - to - noise ratio increases .",
    "however , the convergence speed decreases with the size of the mimo arrays .",
    "the wf algorithm uses all the available channels under the i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh fading assumption .",
    "for the eewf algorithm this is only valid for the siso channel .",
    "as noted above , the maximum energy - efficiency provides a compromise between transmission rate and total transmit power .",
    "the eewf power allocation results in reduced total transmit power at the same time as the achievable transmission rate experiments a loss with respect to the ergodic channel capacity .",
    "this trade - off should be taken into account when designing a wireless systems that aims at providing satisfactory performance in terms of both spectral- and energy - efficiency .",
    "the energy - efficiency of multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) systems with constrained received power establishes a useful trade - off between the transmission rate and the total transmit power .",
    "the proposed energy - efficient water - filling ( eewf ) algorithm provides the optimal power allocation policy that maximizes the instantaneous ratio between transmission rate and the total transmit power given a minimum required total receive power in the single - user mimo case .",
    "studies of the static and the uncorrelated fast fading rayleigh channels show that the eewf provides a non - zero optimal transmit power and non - zero optimal transmission rate . the optimal energy - efficiency as well as the corresponding transmission rate increase with the number of antennas and the signal - to - noise ratio . on the other hand ,",
    "the total transmit power decreases with the number of antennas at the same time as the receive power requirement is satisfied .",
    "future work may include channel correlation as well as the extension to multi - user mimo scenarios .",
    "we can , after some algebraic manipulations , arrive at the following modification of @xmath146 where @xmath147 the variable @xmath148 is related to @xmath41 as follows @xmath149 we can further recast @xmath150 thus , solving is equivalent to finding the roots of the monic polynomial of degree @xmath151 under the assumption that @xmath152 .",
    "now we can expand the product terms into sums @xmath153 where @xmath154 the coefficients @xmath155 are related to coefficients @xmath156 through vieta s formulas @xmath157 where the coefficient @xmath158 is related to a signed sum of all possible sub - products of coefficients @xmath159 , taken @xmath160-at - a - time also known as elementary symmetric sums .",
    "we can apply the same relationships to obtain the coefficients @xmath161 from the coefficients @xmath156 such that @xmath162 .    invoking the fundamental theorem of algebra",
    "we have that there are @xmath151 complex roots that solve .",
    "however , we have to satisfy the condition that @xmath41 is a positive real number . hence",
    ", we choose the solutions that are real positive @xmath163 . furthermore , if there are several candidates we need to choose @xmath41 that actually maximizes the energy - efficiency .",
    "let s assume that we have two solutions @xmath164 and @xmath165 with corresponding energy - efficiencies and transmit powers @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , @xmath169 , respectively . from the conditions of the problem we have that @xmath170 . using this equality together with and after discarding the noise term",
    "since it is asummed equal in both cases we obtain @xmath171 we can set the numerator to zero for each term of the sum and since @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 we obtain @xmath175 now , if @xmath176 and @xmath177 according to the premises of our problem we obtain that @xmath178 must be satisfied .",
    "hence , the largest positive real @xmath41 gives the solution to our problem if it exists .",
    "let s first give the transmission rate to the capacity ratio @xmath179 and the corresponding energy - efficiency ratio @xmath180 in order to show the right hand side of and we need to show that @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the geometric mean ( gm ) of the discrete realizations of @xmath183 , i.e. , @xmath184 , @xmath185 .",
    "let s consider the harmonic mean - geometric mean ( hm - gm ) inequality @xmath186 where @xmath187 is a constant .",
    "hence @xmath188 since the logarithm function is a monotonically increasing function .",
    "the inequality in follows from mahler s inequality @xcite .",
    "finally , we readily arrive at @xmath189 the equality is achieved for infinitely large signal - to - noise ratio , i.e. , @xmath190 , which is obtained straightforwardly by applying the lhospital s rule to , where the derivative is taken with respect to @xmath191 .    to show the left hand side of and we need first to show that @xmath192 but this is readily identified as the bernoulli inequality , where @xmath193 . now , we see that since the logarithmic function is concave function the jensen s inequality for the expected value reads as @xmath194 hence , combining and into and gives the sought - after result .",
    "in this case , the equality is obtained for infinitely small signal - to - noise ratio by following a procedure similar the described above .      c.  han , t.  harrold , s.  armour , i.  krikidis , s.  videv , p.  grant , h.  haas , j.  thompson , i.  ku , c .- x .",

    "<S> we consider the energy - efficiency of multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems with constrained received power rather than constrained transmit power . </S>",
    "<S> a energy - efficient water - filling ( eewf ) algorithm that maximizes the ratio of the transmission rate to the total transmit power has been derived . </S>",
    "<S> the eewf power allocation policy establishes a trade - off between the transmission rate and the total transmit power under the total receive power constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the static and the uncorrelated fast fading rayleigh channels have been considered , where the maximization is performed on the instantaneous realization of the channel assuming perfect information at both the transmitter and the receiver with equal number of antennas . </S>",
    "<S> we show , based on monte carlo simulations that the energy - efficiency provided by the eewf algorithm can be more than an order of magnitude greater than the energy - efficiency corresponding to capacity achieving water - filling ( wf ) algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the energy - efficiency increases with both the number of antennas and the signal - to - noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding transmission rate also increases but at a slower rate than the shannon capacity , while the corresponding total transmit power decreases with the number of antennas . </S>"
