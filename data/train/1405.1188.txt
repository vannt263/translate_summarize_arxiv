    "<S> the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) b - mode polarization , contributed by the primordial gravitational wave , is crucial for understanding the physics of the early universe , especially solidifying our confidence that inflation has ever occurred . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the bicep2 collaboration has declared the detection of the cmb b - mode polarization @xcite . however , it might be wholly or partly due to polarized dust emission @xcite , see also @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath7 implies either new mechanism or non - bunch - davis vacuum is involved during inflation , e.g.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , or the nec is broken , see e.g.@xcite for comments . in past , inflationary model with the nec violation has been also proposed @xcite,@xcite . however , since the almost scale - invariance of the scalar perturbation requires @xmath8 , we generally have @xmath9 during the inflation . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath0 seems be a challenge for the inflationary scenario . </S>",

    "<S> the pre - inflationary evolution may bring signals in tt power spectrum at large angular scale , e.g.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , which mainly imprinted by the primordial scalar perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> besides the evolution of @xmath12 , the scalar spectrum is also affected by the model parameters associated with the field dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> however , the tensor perturbation spectrum only encodes the behavior of @xmath12 , which straightly records the evolution of the primordial universe . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath0 at large scale will be a significant hint of what occurring before inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of a short period of inflation has been studied in ref.@xcite , without a pre - inflationary nec violation . however </S>",
    "<S> , a pre - inflationary evolution with nec violation is interesting , since it helps to solve the initial singularity problem of inflationary universe @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we will propose an inflationary scenario , in which the pre - inflationary evolution of the primordial universe is a slowly expanding genesis phase . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this pre - inflationary genesis will make the primordial tensor spectrum get a large - scale cutoff , i.e. @xmath13 at large scale , while @xmath1 at small scale . </S>",
    "<S> thus this scenario not only may be consistent with the observation , but also predicts a large - scale anomaly in bb power spectrum , i.e. due to the large suppression of tensor perturbation amplitude we will hardly see the reionization bump at @xmath14 , which may be falsified by the upcoming planck polarization data .    </S>",
