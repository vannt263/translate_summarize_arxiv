    "it is well known from experiments that the most prominent feature of supercooled liquids and glass forming systems is the rapid increase of their relaxation time as temperature is decreased  @xcite . since the early eighties ,",
    "computer simulations have become a powerful tool to investigate such systems and hence to increase our understanding of their extraordinary dynamical behavior  @xcite .",
    "however , because of the rapid increase of the relaxation times these simulations are faced with the intrinsic problem that , over a large range of temperature , systems can not be equilibrated , as the simulation time , typically @xmath7s for an atomic system , is smaller than the relaxation time .",
    "this means that on a computer , any system with a longer relaxation time can only be studied under nonequilibrium conditions . in other words , in computer simulations the `` glass transition '' always takes place at temperatures higher than in real experiments .    despite this drawback , it has been shown that computer simulations can provide useful information on the mechanisms than underly the rapid increase of the time scales in supercooled liquids .",
    "one of the most valuable contributions in this direction was the proof that the so called mode - coupling theory  @xcite does indeed provide a quantitative description of this slowing down within the time window explored in the simulation , at least for those simple atomic liquids that are `` fragile glass formers '' , i.e. show a strongly non - arrhenius dependence of the relaxation times as a function of temperature .",
    "the findings from computer simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite have largely confirmed that this theory provides a consistent picture for the dynamical behaviour of such liquids over a relaxation time range that covers several decades , typically @xmath8s .    for larger relaxation times ( lower temperatures ) ,",
    "equilibrium simulations are no longer possible . on the other hand",
    ", one can take advantage of the flexibility of the simulation to explore the _ nonequilibrium _ properties on times scales that would be rather difficult to access in experiments .",
    "this possibility stems from the fact that the simulations allows instantaneous quenches to low temperatures , and a monitoring of the subsequent evolution on a fast time scale .",
    "experimentally , the study of nonequilibrium evolution in glassy systems following a fast quench is a field that has been explored since a long time in the so called `` aging '' experiments @xcite , performed on a time scale of hours or even days .",
    "more specifically , `` physical aging '' consists in a slow evolution of the characteristic properties of glassy systems that do not undergo any changes in their chemical composition . of particular interest is the evolution of response functions ( typically the elastic compliance ) that are usually found , e.g. in polymeric systems , to exhibit a strong slowing down as the _ waiting time _",
    "( i.e. the time elapsed since the quench ) increases .",
    "the recent interest of the physics community in this behavior was aroused when a number of experiments performed on spin glasses showed that a very similar behavior could be observed in these disordered magnetic systems .",
    "in particular it was found that the response to a magnetic field of a system that has been quenched into its low temperature , nonequilibrium spin glass phase , becomes more and more sluggish as the waiting time increases @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a number of theories were put forward to explain this aging behavior of spin glass systems from first principles statistical physics .",
    "a comprehensive review of these theories can be found in reference @xcite . essentially , one is lead to distinguish between phenomenological `` trap models '' , domain growth theories , and mode - coupling or mean field theories .",
    "`` trap models '' describe the evolution of systems as a random walk in a complex phase space , which can under certain conditions give rise to aging .",
    "the domain growth models assume that the aging results from a coarsening process somewhat similar to what can be observed in a ferromagnetic system quenched below its critical temperature .",
    "mean field or mode - coupling theories account exactly for the aging behaviour of some disordered models in the limit of high dimension ( e.g. a particle in a random potential in a high dimensional space ) .",
    "interestingly , these mean field theories give rise to a mathematical structure that is very similar to that of the mode - coupling theory commonly used to describe the dynamical properties of supercooled liquids  @xcite . a major difference",
    ", however , is that high dimensional systems can be shown to have a true transition towards a non - ergodic behavior as the temperature is lowered , whereas it is well known that the transition predicted by the mode - coupling theory of liquids is smeared out and does not give rise to a true singularity . if , however , a true transition is present , a natural consequence is that a system quenched below the transition temperature will display aging behavior .",
    "theoretically , this aging behavior of mean field systems was studied in great detail and is now quite well understood @xcite .",
    "the question arises , however , to what extent this description is relevant to the aging behaviour of real , three dimensional systems .",
    "in particular , in view of the mathematical similarity mentioned above , it is quite natural to inquire whether the nonequilibrium dynamics of those supercooled liquids that are known to be well described by mode - coupling theory can be accounted for by the mean field description of aging .    in an attempt to partially answer this question , we present molecular dynamics simulations of a simple glass forming liquid , whose properties under equilibrium conditions",
    "have been extensively studied in previous work  @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the characterization of the `` aging '' behaviour of such a system on the time scales that can be investigated in molecular dynamics simulations , i.e. a few nanoseconds . once again",
    ", we emphasize that these time scales are very different from those usually investigated in aging experiments on glasses ( although some recent dielectric spectroscopy experiments @xcite investigate relatively high frequency behaviour ) . moreover , the systems under study would , from an experimental viewpoint , be considered as supercooled liquids rather than glasses .",
    "glassy behavior is observed only on the restricted time scale of the computer simulation .",
    "the possibility of exploring such relatively short time scales is nevertheless interesting , as it is precisely on such time scales that mode - coupling theory is successful .",
    "moreover , the simulation offers the opportunity to simultaneously compute time dependent correlation functions , static quantities and response functions . relating these quantities to each other",
    "is an essential achievement in mean field theories of aging behaviour , whose predictions can then be tested in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we recall the main features of our model and describe some technical details of the simulations .",
    "sections iii and iv describe the aging behavior of static properties and of correlation functions , respectively .",
    "section v deals with the aging behaviour of response functions .",
    "preliminary accounts of these results can be found in @xcite .",
    "some closely related studies , on a slightly different system , have been reported in @xcite .",
    "the model we use is a binary ( 80:20 ) mixture of particles , which in the following we will call a and b particles , that interact via a lennard - jones potential , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "the constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 are given by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and the potential is cut off and shifted at a distance @xmath19 . in the following",
    "we will report the results in reduced units , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the unit of length and energy , respectively ( setting the boltzmann constant @xmath22 ) .",
    "time will be measured in units of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mass of the particles .    the simulation was done with @xmath25 particles and at constant volume @xmath26 , with a box length @xmath27 . at this density",
    "the _ equilibrium _ dynamics of the system has been investigated intensively  @xcite and it has been found that at low temperatures , @xmath28 , this dynamics is described very well by mode - coupling theory  @xcite with a critical temperature @xmath29 . although there is evidence that for temperatures @xmath30 the increase of the relaxation times , or the inverse of the diffusion constant , is less strong than the power - law predicted by mct , @xmath31 , with @xmath32  @xcite , the increase is still so strong that at temperatures less than @xmath33 the relaxation time of the system exceeds by orders of magnitude the time scale accessible to a present state of the art computer simulation ( @xmath34 time units ) .",
    "hence for a computer simulation @xmath33 plays the role of the glass transition temperature @xmath35",
    ".    the equations of motion were integrated with the velocity form of the verlet algorithm , with a step size of 0.02 .",
    "the system was equilibrated in the high temperature phase at a temperature @xmath36 and then quenched at time @xmath37 to a temperature @xmath38 .",
    "this quench was done by means of a stochastic heat bath , i.e. every 50 time steps we replaced the velocities of all the particles with ones that were drawn from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution corresponding to a temperature @xmath39 . in order to study the dependence of the relaxation behavior on the initial and final temperature we considered several values of @xmath40 and @xmath39 : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "after the quench we propagated the system for a waiting time @xmath0 after which the measurements of the quantities of interest were started .",
    "in the course of the simulations we realized that there are appreciable sample to sample variations of the relaxation curves .",
    "therefore it was necessary to average for each combination of @xmath40 and @xmath39 over 8 - 10 independent runs .",
    "one - time quantities are observables which in equilibrium are constants , such as the total energy of the system , the pressure or , in a magnetic system , the magnetization . in the non - equilibrium situation",
    "these observables depend on the time which has elapsed since the quench and thus are commonly called `` one - time '' quantities .",
    "it has been shown before , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , that the time dependence of such quantities is relatively weak . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the time dependence of @xmath43 , the potential energy per particle , for various combinations of @xmath40 and @xmath39 . from the figure it becomes evident that this time dependence is rather weak . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that it can be approximated well by a power - law with a small exponent ( 0.14 ) , or alternatively by a logarithmic time dependence .",
    "qualitatively this result agrees with the one of monte carlo simulations of a soft sphere system  @xcite and a polymer model  @xcite in which also power - law dependences have been observed for one - time quantities .",
    "however , the exponents found in these simulations ( 0.7 and 1/3 ) are significantly larger than our , thus indicating that they are not universal quantities .",
    "the large exponent of reference  @xcite might , however , be also due to the fact that in that simulation @xmath40 was infinity and that the runs were rather short , i.e. that the dependence of @xmath44 on time was not the one valid for very long times .    from fig .",
    "[ fig1]a we conclude that at long times the curves do not depend significantly on the value of the initial temperature ( see the curves with @xmath45 ) . for short times , however , such a dependence can be seen , in that , e.g. , the curve with @xmath46 is almost constant and shows only at long times a time dependence which is similar to the one for higher values of @xmath40 ( see also ref .",
    "this time dependence starts to be observable only for times that are comparable with the @xmath2-relaxation time of the system at @xmath40 , which for @xmath46 is on the order of @xmath47 time units  @xcite , since this is the typical time scale that the system needs to find a significantly different configuration .",
    "this estimate is , however , only a lower bound , since the dynamics of the system is given by the temperature @xmath48 , and is hence slower than the one at @xmath40 .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a further discussion of this point .",
    "the figure also shows that there is a significant dependence of the curves on @xmath39 in that the values of @xmath43 decrease with decreasing @xmath39 . in a harmonic solid at a temperature @xmath39 one",
    "expects that the ( equilibrium ! ) potential energy varies like @xmath49 and thus it is reasonable to subtract this `` trivial contribution '' from the curves .",
    "the result of this subtraction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b from which we see that this procedure does indeed make the curves collapse reasonably well .",
    "the most significant exceptions are the curves ( @xmath46 , @xmath45 ) and ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "these deviations can be understood by realizing that during the aging process the system is looking for configurations with low lying energies .",
    "if this search is started at a relatively low temperature , such as @xmath46 , the system will typically be able to find configurations that have a lower potential energy than in the case when @xmath40 is large thus explaining why the curve for @xmath46 is below the other ones .",
    "in addition to this , such a search will be more efficient at a higher temperature @xmath39 than at a low one , since then the system has a better chance to overcome small local barriers .",
    "this explains why the curve for ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) is above the other ones with the same value of @xmath40 .",
    "since also the radial distribution function @xmath52 is a one - time quantity we expect that also its dependence on time is weak . that this is indeed the case is shown in the main part of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where we show @xmath53 , i.e. the partial radial distribution function for the a particles ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for its definition ) for the times @xmath37 ( i.e. before the quench ) , @xmath54 , 100 , 1000 , 10000 , and 63100 time units . from the figure",
    "we see that immediately after the quench @xmath53 changes its shape very quickly in that , e.g. , the first nearest neighbor peak which in the high temperature phase ( curve labeled with @xmath37 ) is not very high , becomes much higher and narrower . for times larger than 10",
    ", the shape becomes essentially independent of time , as expected for a one - time quantity and in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "that the form of @xmath53 _ at long times _ has a significant dependence on @xmath39 is demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we show the main peak for different values of @xmath39 at long times ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "as expected we find that the height of this peak increases with decreasing temperature and that it becomes narrower .",
    "thus we conclude that the typical configurations in which the system is stuck after long times does depend on the final temperature .",
    "very recently latz made the interesting proposition that the typical configurations in which the system is stuck at long times during the aging process share a common property in that all of them are very close to the so - called critical surface of mode - coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite which divides the liquid like phase of the system from its glass like phase  @xcite .",
    "mct predicts that this critical surface can be calculated by using as input the radial distribution function , i.e. a purely _ static _",
    "quantity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore it has been shown that , for simple liquids , the relevant part of this input is related to the area under the first peak in the structure factor  @xcite , or alternatively , to the area under the first peak in @xmath52 weighted with @xmath56 . in order to test the validity of the proposition by latz we have therefore calculated the integral of @xmath57 between zero and 1.406 , the location of the first minimum in @xmath53 .",
    "note that this integral , which we call @xmath58 , is the partial coordination number . the time and @xmath39 dependence of @xmath58",

    "the value of this limiting constant , which we call @xmath60 , increases weakly with increasing @xmath39 but to a first approximation it can be considered as independent of @xmath39 , thus supporting the prediction of latz .    in order to see whether the @xmath39 dependence of @xmath60 is indeed weak it is useful to compare it with the temperature dependence of the area under the first peak @xmath61 _ in equilibrium_. for this we have included in the figure also the value of @xmath58 for temperatures @xmath62 ( filled symbols ) .",
    "( the @xmath53 for the various temperatures are results from other simulations  @xcite . ) in this temperature range the equilibrium value of @xmath58 shows an appreciable temperatures dependence ( which is close to a logarithmic dependence ) which is indeed much more pronounced than the @xmath39 dependence of @xmath60 of the non - equilibrium simulations .",
    "to a first approximation the value of @xmath60 is given by the value of @xmath58 of the equilibrium curve at @xmath63 , where @xmath33 is the so - called critical temperature of mct  @xcite .",
    "for the present system this critical temperature has been estimated to be around @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "due to the problem to equilibrate the system at temperatures close to @xmath33 it is currently not possible to determine the equilibrium value of @xmath58 at @xmath33 and therefore to compare this value with the @xmath60 from the out - of - equilibrium simulations .",
    "however , since the equilibrium value of @xmath58 is expected to show a smooth temperature dependence , it can be estimated quite reliably from the equilibrium data at a bit higher temperatures . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show an enlargement of the region which is marked by a box in the main figure and which encloses the temperature range around @xmath33 . from this inset",
    "we see that the values of @xmath60 for @xmath65 and @xmath45 are indeed very close to an extrapolation of the equilibrium curve to @xmath33 .",
    "hence we conclude that it is indeed possible to calculate from the equilibrium data with reasonable accuracy also certain quantities for the out - of - equilibrium situation .",
    "this point is discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "in equilibrium , time correlation functions between any two observables @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 depend only on the time difference @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath69 , for all waiting times @xmath0 .",
    "for the out of equilibrium situation this equality no longer holds and therefore such time correlation functions depend on two quantities , the time difference @xmath3 and @xmath0 , the time passed since the generation of the non - equilibrium situation .",
    "therefore such correlation functions are called two - times quantities and in this subsection we will demonstrate that such quantities are very well suited to investigate the aging dynamics of out of equilibrium systems .    for liquids in _ equilibrium _ the dynamics",
    "is often studied by means of the intermediate scattering function @xmath70 which is defined by  @xcite    @xmath71    and by the its so - called self part , @xmath72 given by    @xmath73    here @xmath74 are the positions of the particles at time @xmath6 and @xmath75 is the wave vector . for the non - equilibrium situation",
    "these functions are generalized to    @xmath76    and    @xmath77    ( note that these last equations are trivially generalized to multi - component systems . ) for the present system the dependence of @xmath70 and @xmath72 on time and temperature have been discussed extensively in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the time dependence of the corresponding quantities @xmath78 and @xmath79 for different waiting times @xmath0 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 are 0 , i.e. immediately after the quench , and @xmath80 , 100 , 1000 , 10000 , and 63100 time units and the final temperature @xmath45 ( solid lines ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a we show @xmath78 for @xmath81 , the location of the first peak in the partial structure factor of the a - a correlation  @xcite .",
    "we see that the correlation function decays quite quickly as a function of @xmath3 , which in view of the fact that we are at a very low temperature might be surprising",
    ". however , one should realize that the decay of the correlation function to zero does _ not _ imply that the system has relaxed to equilibrium but only that the particle configuration at the end of the measurement is uncorrelated with the configuration at the start . from the figure we see that with increasing value of the waiting time the decay of the curves occurs at longer and longer times .",
    "this observation can be rationalized by realizing that the driving force which leads to the decorrelation of the state at time @xmath3 from the state at time zero decreases with increasing waiting time @xmath0 since in the time between zero and @xmath0 the system had already the possibility to relax .",
    "this @xmath0 dependence of the curves is , however , only observed at long times . for short times",
    "the curves fall onto a master curve and leave this master curve only at a time which increases with @xmath0 ( and is roughly proportional to @xmath0  @xcite ) .",
    "the time regime in which this master curve is observed is usually called `` short time regime '' whereas the time regime in which the curves show a significant @xmath0 dependence is called the `` aging regime '' . in the short time",
    "regime the particles rattle in the cages formed by their nearest neighbors and this type of motion is thus not sensitive on the value of @xmath0 ( if @xmath0 is not too small ) . only for longer times",
    "the particles are able to leave this cage and the typical time scale for this process depends strongly on @xmath0 .",
    "we also mention that the oscillation seen in the curves at @xmath82 originates from the coupling of the system to the heat bath .",
    "since at this time the velocities of all particles are swapped with the ones drawn from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution at temperature @xmath39 , the motion of the particles is , on average , slowed down or even reversed .",
    "hence for a brief period the relaxation is slower than expected and thus the correlation curve decays slower .",
    "this effect is , however , only seen at short times and thus can be disregarded for large values of @xmath3 .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the relaxation behavior of the system in this non - equilibrium situation with the one in equilibrium . in fig .",

    "this curve essentially coincides with the above discussed master curve in the short time regime . for times",
    "@xmath3 larger than 1.0 deviations are observed , which are _ not _ due to the mentioned oscillations .",
    "a careful inspection of the curves shows that the approach of the master curve and the dashed curve to the ( quasi ) plateau at intermediate times is quite different from each other in that the former shows a very slow approach whereas the one of the latter is quite fast .",
    "also at long times we find differences in the relaxation behavior . in equilibrium",
    "it has been demonstrated that the relaxation curves can be fitted very well by the so - called kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) function , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the relaxation time and an exponent @xmath87  @xcite . from the figure",
    "we see that at long times the shape of the equilibrium and non - equilibrium curves are quite different and a more detailed analysis shows that a kww function does not give a good fit to the data .",
    "what seems to be the same , however , ( or at least very similar ) is the height of the plateau , i.e. the so - called edwards - anderson parameter  @xcite or non - ergodicity parameter .    in fig .",

    "as we will see later , it is expected that the quantity @xmath24 depends on the value of @xmath39  @xcite .",

    "[ fig5 ] , it is hard to conclude whether or not such a dependence is indeed present since the choice of the non - ergodicity parameter affects the values of the exponents also .",
    "therefore we have calculated the ratios @xmath119 also for lower values of @xmath39 , @xmath120 and 0.1 , and found that the curves for the different observables do indeed fall onto a master curve also .",
    "more important is the observation that within the accuracy of our data this master curve does not depend on @xmath39 , thus giving evidence that the function @xmath118 is only a weak function of @xmath39 .",
    "we also mention that mean - field calculations lead to the expectation that the quantities @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath24 in eq .",

    "the resolution of this apparent problem is that if we assume @xmath96 to be constant that a decrease of @xmath24 can be compensated by an increase of @xmath95 .",
    "it is , however , simple to see that if @xmath24 is small @xmath95 has to be close to 0.5 and that a variation of @xmath24 can be compensated by a very small change in @xmath95 , i.e. without leading to an appreciable change in @xmath118 .",
    "having analyzed the relaxation behavior of the system in the @xmath1-relaxation regime we now investigate the one of the @xmath2-regime , i.e. the relaxation of the system at long times .",
    "when we discussed the time correlation functions in fig .  [ fig4]a we already mentioned that in this regime the relaxation differs from the one in the equilibrium situation in that the time correlation functions can not be described well by the kww - law . in fig .",

    "we recognize that for all wave - vectors the long time dependence of the functions are compatible with a power - law and that the exponent depends on the wave - vector in that it decreases with decreasing @xmath101 .",
    "since at long times @xmath124 shows a power - law dependence it is not possible to define a relaxation time .",

    "a comparison of the curves for @xmath116 and @xmath128 shows that the time needed to decay to 50% of the initial value differs by almost a factor of 100 , thus much more than the factor of 4 expected for a diffusive process , or the factor found in the relaxation dynamics of supercooled liquids _ in equilibrium_. this shows that during the aging process the relaxation at long times is indeed very different from the one in supercooled liquids .",
    "we now turn our attention to the time and waiting time dependence of the two - time correlation functions at long times . within mean - field theory",
    "it is expected that for systems which show a discontinuous dependence of the non - ergodicity parameter on temperature , which is the case for the structural glass studied here , this dependence can be written ( in the limit of long waiting times ) as    @xmath129    here @xmath130 is the time dependence of @xmath91 at short times which is supposed to be independent of @xmath0 ( in agreement with our findings , see fig .",

    "we see that in these cases the curves for the different waiting times do not collapse nicely at long times .",
    "thus this is further evidence that the function @xmath5 depends on the observable considered .",
    "we also mention that although we have determined the optimal shape of @xmath139 also for the other wave - vectors , it is difficult to compare these different functions with each other .",
    "the problem is , that if @xmath5 is an optimal function that for example also @xmath140 ( with arbitrary @xmath2 ) is an optimal function , i.e. there is no unique representation of @xmath5 .",
    "essentially all the results discussed so far were obtained for a final temperature @xmath45 .",

    "a markedly different behavior in the relaxation is observed for temperatures much lower than @xmath33 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig10 ] , which shows the results for @xmath78 after a quench to @xmath51 .",
    "the values of the waiting times and of the wave - vector @xmath101 are the same as in figure  [ fig4 ] ( @xmath141 . at short times",
    "@xmath3 , the dependences are qualitatively similar for the two final temperatures .",
    "the only difference is the increase in the plateau value when the temperature is lowered .",
    "this increase is easily understood from the fact that the amplitude of the vibrational motion about an equilibrium position decreases when @xmath142 decreases . from harmonic theory",
    "a linear dependence of @xmath143 on @xmath142 at low temperatures can be expected , and such a dependence is indeed compatible with our results .    for large values of @xmath0 and @xmath3 ,",
    "the behaviour for @xmath51 is strikingly different from what was observed at @xmath45 .",
    "instead of decaying rapidly to zero for @xmath144 , the correlators level off and appear to display an additional plateau at a value of @xmath145 smaller than @xmath146 .    in order to get some insight into this surprising behavior ,",
    "we have studied separately the correlation functions obtained for various samples prior to averaging .",
    "looking at the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] for some of the samples , it appears that the decay to this second plateau is triggered by a large amplitude and rather sudden drop of the correlation function , that , depending on the sample , takes place typically @xmath147 to @xmath47 time units after the quench ( see inset of fig .  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "an analysis of the configurations shows that this sudden drop is related to a very collective dynamical event , in which a substantial fraction of the particles ( 10% ) move by a rather small amount , typically 0.1 - 0.5@xmath148 .",
    "such motions can be understood from the fact that a deep quench leaves the system in a highly stressed configuration , so that the relaxation first proceeds through large `` earthquake like '' events , that release the local stress significantly . only at longer times",
    "the aging dynamics crosses over to the very smooth process observed at higher values of @xmath39 .",
    "we emphasize that these events do not seem to be related to the hopping like motion of the particles which is observed in the deeply supercooled state _ above _ the glass transition temperature  @xcite . in that case",
    "only very few ( 2 - 3 ) particles are involved and during the jump these particles move on the order of one nearest neighbor distance .",
    "in contrast to this , the `` catastrophic events '' during the aging are very collective ( 50 - 100 particles ) and the particles move only about 10 - 30 % of the typical nearest neighbor distance ( as can be inferred from the self part of the van hove correlation function ) . a typical event is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] where we show the particles just before the event ( spheres ) and their location after the event ( tip of arrows ) . from this figure",
    "we recognize that in such an event the stress is released along a surface or even a line through the sample and not through the motion of the particles in a ( bulk - like ) three dimensional blob .",
    "obviously , the catastrophic events that cause the decay of the correlations in this situation are rather difficult to average over , and a very large number of samples would be required to obtain a reasonable statistical accuracy .",
    "moreover , it is quite likely that these events correspond to a transient , so that the second plateau we observe is not really representative of the asymptotic behavior .",
    "interestingly , however , rather similar shapes of the time correlation functions were observed by bonn and coworkers @xcite in their dynamical light scattering studies of aging in clay ( laponite ) suspensions . in that case",
    "the height of the second plateau was found to steadily increase with waiting time , confirming the transient nature of the effect .",
    "we also mention that the occurence of these events are related to the fact that the typical configuration at high temperature ( @xmath50 ) are quite different from the ones towards the system evolves to at @xmath39 , thus giving rise to large stresses . since in _",
    "strong _ glass formers ( e.g. @xmath149 ) the structure has a much weaker temperature dependance than in fragil eglassformers such as the present system , it can be expected that in the aging dynamics of the former no such `` catastrophic events '' should be observed .",
    "one of the crucial points that was derived from the solution of the dynamical equations in mean field models of spin glasses is the fact that , in a nonequilibrium system , the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) is violated in a nontrivial way .",
    "we will first briefly recall the main results from mean - field theories of spin glasses , and then discuss how the violation of fdt can be quantified in our system .",
    "let us consider an observable @xmath66 whose normalized autocorrelation function is denoted by @xmath145 .",
    "if @xmath150 denotes a field conjugate to @xmath66 , the response of @xmath66 to @xmath150 is defined as @xmath151 . in an equilibrium system",
    ", this response function is invariant under time translation , i.e. @xmath152 , and is related to the correlation function by the fluctuation dissipation theorem , @xmath153 . out of equilibrium",
    ", this relation does not hold any more , and a `` fluctuation dissipation ratio '' ( fdr ) @xmath154 can be defined as    @xmath155    much attention has been devoted to the asymptotic behavior of this fluctuation dissipation ratio .",
    "in particular , it has been shown @xcite that in the asymptotic limit @xmath156 , the fluctuation dissipation ratio in mean field models of spin glasses , as well as in coarsening systems , becomes a non - singular function of @xmath157 , i.e. @xmath158 .",
    "a direct consequence from this is that the more easily accessible integrated response    @xmath159    can be written as a continuous function of @xmath145    @xmath160    from a practical point of view , the nontrivial consequence of these statements is that a parametric plot of @xmath161 versus @xmath91 ( with @xmath3 as the parameter ) should , for long times , converge towards a master curve , independent of the waiting time .",
    "such a behavior has been observed in a number of spin glass simulations @xcite .    in order to test whether the same property holds in structural glasses",
    ", we have to devise a way of measuring the response function associated to @xmath162 , which is the only correlation function that can be obtained with a reasonable accuracy in the aging regime .",
    "the procedure we use is the following .",
    "a fictive  charge \" @xmath163 is assigned randomly to each particle .",
    "an additional term of the form @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is a small ( @xmath166 external potential , is then added to the hamiltonian .",
    "it is then easy to check that , _ if one averages over several realizations of the random charge distribution _ , the time - correlation function of the observable @xmath167 is the incoherent scattering function @xmath124 . the procedure to generate",
    "the response function associated to @xmath124 is thus straightforward : for a given realization of the random charge distribution , the system is equilibrated at a high temperature ( @xmath50 ) , and quenched at @xmath37 to the desired final temperature @xmath39 .",
    "the evolution is followed with the field @xmath168 off until a waiting time @xmath0 , then the field is switched on and the response @xmath169 is monitored . the same procedure is repeated for several ( 7 to 10 ) realizations of the charge distribution , in order to get the response function .",
    "the quantity we obtain by this procedure is then an integrated response function @xmath161 ( eq .",
    "[ eq18 ] ) , since    @xmath170    we have checked that this procedure indeed yields the correct response function by checking the fluctuation dissipation theorem in an equilibrium system . in that case ,",
    "a slightly different procedure was used , in the sense that we monitored the decay of the response after switching off the field .",
    "the fluctuation dissipation theorem implies that this decay is directly proportional to the correlation function , a result that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] . from this figure",
    "we see that the quality of the response data is significantly poorer than the one for the correlation data .",
    "this is due to the fact that the latter can be averaged over time origins and wave - vector directions , hence improving drastically the statistical accuracy .      for the nonequilibrium case typical results for the integrated response function",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , for @xmath45 , @xmath171 and two values of the waiting time . as expected , the response , like the correlation , gets slower as the waiting time increases . as in the equilibrium case ,",
    "the quality of the response data is poorer than that of the correlation data . in that case",
    ", the average over wave - vector directions in obtaining the correlation data probably explains this difference . despite this noise",
    "it can be seen from the figure that at long times the curve for the response lies above the one for the correlation function , i.e. that the response is smaller than expected from the fdt .",
    "as explained above , mean field theories of spin glasses suggest that interesting information can be obtained from a parametric plot of @xmath172 versus @xmath173 at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "such a plot is shown in figures [ fig14 ] ( a - c ) for three values of the final temperature , @xmath45 , @xmath120 and @xmath51 .",
    "the wave - vector is @xmath171 .",
    "for each temperature , results obtained at different waiting times are shown . in spite of the scatter in the data , the figures are clearly compatible with the existence of a master curve independent of the waiting time .",
    "obviously , the quality of the data does not allow a quantitative analysis of this master curve .",
    "we can nevertheless argue that two different regimes can be distinguished . for high values of the correlation ( @xmath124 close to unity ) ,",
    "the parametric plot is essentially a straight line with slope @xmath174 .",
    "a slope of @xmath174 would be observed in an equilibrium system obeying fdt . at lower values of the correlation , a clear deviation from this fdt slope is observed .",
    "although other fits are certainly possible , we can describe the parametric plot as consisting of two straight lines , one with slope @xmath174 and one with a negative slope @xmath175 .",
    "the reason for choosing such a description and the corresponding interpretation will be discussed in the next section .",
    "a similar analysis was performed for another value of the wave - vector ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "very similar results are obtained , and the slope of @xmath24 of the non - fdt part in the parametric plot seems to be independent of the wave - vector .    before discussing the results , we mention that the results for this parametric plot are very sensitive to the linearity of the response .",
    "hence we always checked carefully that our results were independent of the amplitude of the applied field . in practice , applying a stronger field does not affect the fdt part of the parametric plot , but tends to affect strongly the second part , in that it leads to a decrease in the parameter @xmath24 that describes the non - fdt part of the curve .",
    "the importance of the fluctuation dissipation ratio @xmath177 in glassy systems was first recognized in the context of the mean field theory of spin glasses @xcite , when it appeared that this fdr was intimately related to the nature of ergodicity breaking in the system .",

    ", we have to find which scenario is compatible with the results presented in the last section . from figs .",
    "[ fig14 ] , it would appear that the most likely scenario is that of a system with one step replica symmetry breaking , for which @xmath177 is a stepwise constant function .",
    "in that case the parametric plot consists in two straight lines , one with slope @xmath174 and one with slope @xmath193 ( bold straight lines ) .",
    "obviously the asymptotic nature of the results can be questioned .",
    "however , the fact that we obtained an essentially @xmath0 independent plot is already an indication that we are approaching the asymptotic limit .",
    "it could also be that preasymptotic effects cancel out when the parametric plot is used .",
    "indeed , such a plot is even obtained for @xmath51 , where we have seen that strong `` catastrophic '' events influence the relaxation .",
    "finally , we mention that in systems in which preasymptotic effects have been observed and studied ( mostly domain growth models ) @xcite , they very clearly show up in the parametric plot as a @xmath0 dependence of the crossover region between the fdt part and the non - fdt region .",
    "the overall shape of the parametric plot is not affected much .",
    "such a dependence could then explain the fact that in our data , the crossover between the fdt part and the non - fdt part takes place at a value of @xmath145 _ smaller _ than the plateau value @xmath146 in the correlation function , a feature which contradicts theoretical expectations .",
    "the tendency of the curves to `` overshoot '' in the crossover region , perceptible in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , is reminiscent of the observations made in reference @xcite , and could also be a transient effect . in that paper",
    "it was argued that , e.g. , in a coarsening system with some defects the de - pinning of a domain wall from a defect will give rise to a strong enhancement of the response just after the event . since the `` catastrophic '' events correspond to a violent and , most likely , pre - asymptotic release of the stress , it is reasonable to assume that also in this case the response will be larger than expected .    if we accept that our parametric plots correspond to the one step replica symmetry breaking case , we can extract from the data an estimate for the slope @xmath194 of the non - fdt part .",
    "the resulting slopes are given by : @xmath45 , @xmath195 ; @xmath120 , @xmath196 ; @xmath51 , @xmath197 .",
    "as mentioned above , these results appear to be independent of the wave - vector . within the accuracy of our data",
    ", they are compatible with a linear dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath39 , quite similar to that found by parisi  @xcite for a soft - sphere system .",
    "we also note that the value found for @xmath45 is compatible with the result @xmath198 that was extracted from a scaling analysis of the correlation functions alone .",
    "it is interesting to analyze our results for @xmath24 using the `` effective temperature '' concept introduced in reference @xcite .",
    "( for a different approach to the effective temperature see the papers of nieuwenhuizen  @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "an effective `` fluctuation dissipation temperature '' @xmath199 is defined as @xmath200 , where @xmath142 is the actual external temperature .",
    "crudely speaking , the `` fast '' degrees of freedom ( those that correspond to the rapid decay of @xmath145 to its plateau value ) are at equilibrium with the thermostat at temperature @xmath142 , while the slow degrees of freedom , which govern the aging behavior , are at equilibrium at a higher temperature . then the concept of effective temperature can be thought as a rationalization of the older `` fictive temperature '' concept @xcite . within this interpretation ,",
    "a linear dependence of @xmath201 on @xmath39 corresponds to a constant effective temperature .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to expect first that @xmath201 should be equal to @xmath202 , where @xmath33 is the mode coupling critical temperature , since systems cooled below @xmath33 fall out of equilibrium at @xmath33 .",

    "indeed , the `` ideal '' result @xmath204 can only be expected to hold for systems that would be cooled infinitely slowly , so that they would remain in equilibrium down to @xmath33 , and for which ergodicity restoring hopping processes can be completely neglected . for a system that is cooled with a finite cooling rate",
    ", it is not surprising to find an effective temperature which is above @xmath33 .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a detailed numerical study of the out of equilibrium relaxation ( `` aging '' ) of a simple glass forming system .",
    "the time scales we have investigated are those allowed by the current possibilities of molecular dynamics simulations , typically @xmath205s .",
    "we will now try to briefly summarize the main conclusions that can be inferred from these numerical results .",
    "first , it appears that static quantities are , on these time scales , only very weakly dependent of time . by static ( or `` one time '' ) quantities we mean , as usual , those quantities that can be obtained from the knowledge of a single configuration of the system . in particular , we have shown that the pair correlation functions ( and hence all the derived quantities like the energy or the pressure ) appear to equilibrate very quickly after the quench .",
    "these one - time quantities show some sensitivity to the quench history and to the final temperature and we find that to a first approximation they correspond to configurations which are very close to the critical surface of ( equilibrium ) mode - coupling theory .",
    "hence we have evidence that for this model and within the time span of the simulation the system is not able to penetrate this surface and hence remains in the liquid like part of configuration space .",
    "in contrast to this weak dependence , the two - time correlation functions are very sensitive to the aging time .",
    "when the quench temperature is relatively high ( i.e. still close to the mode - coupling critical temperature that was identified for our system ) , the waiting time dependence of these functions can be described in rather simple terms .",
    "functions obtained for various @xmath0 can be rescaled on a master curve , and an analysis of this curve yields results that are compatible with the predictions of mean field ( `` mode - coupling '' ) theories of the glass transition formulated for the `` @xmath180-spin '' spin glass models .    at lower final temperatures , the behaviour of the two - time correlation functions is much more complex .",
    "the relaxation is largely dominated by `` catastrophic events '' that involve a small , but collective , displacement of a large number of particles .",
    "these infrequent and large events are very difficult to average over , so that the statistical quality of the data for the correlation functions is rather poor . due to the limited time range of the simulations , we do not know whether these events are transients effects releasing some initial stresses due to the quench , or constitute a genuine characteristic of low temperature relaxation .",
    "the flexibility of md simulations allows an independent measurement of the two - time response functions , which at equilibrium would be related to the correlation functions through the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) . a parametric representation of the response versus the correlation allows to clearly distinguish between a `` quasi - equilibrium '' region in which the fdt holds , and a second regime in which it is violated .",
    "an essential feature is that this parametric plot does not ( or , at most , very weakly ) depend on waiting time , so that the `` fdt '' and `` non - fdt '' regimes do not correspond to _ time windows _ but rather to _ correlation _ windows .",
    "this remarkable feature , predicted by mean field theories of spin glasses to hold in the asymptotic limit , is observed here for structural glasses at finite times .",
    "this is likely related to the formal similarities between the mode - coupling theories of structural glasses , which are known to describe quite well the equilibrium behaviour of our system , and these mean field models of spin glasses . as the response / correlation relationship observed for our model",
    "resembles the one observed in spin systems with one step replica symmetry breaking , one may speculate that the phase space structures in both systems are also similar .",
    "if this is the case , a quite appealing scenario for the glass transition can be devised , that reconciles some of the old ideas of the adams - gibbs approach with the more modern mode - coupling scenario , as discussed in detail in reference @xcite .    unfortunately , we presently do not have at our disposal a quantitative theory of nonequilibrium behaviour in structural glasses . the theoretical framework currently provided by mean - field theories of spin glasses",
    "can be considered as a schematic model , and hence does not allow comparisons beyond the qualitative level . at this level",
    ", we find that the general behaviour of our system is in quite good agreement with this schematic model . the agreement ( and disagreements )",
    "are somewhat reminiscent of what is observed when comparing equilibrium data with predictions of schematic mode - coupling theories .    finally , it is natural to inquire about the relevance of a work on aging phenomena based on a method that is limited to time scales smaller than @xmath7s to the aging effects observed on much longer time scales .",
    "the general picture we obtain provides , however , some support for a scenario @xcite that may be of general relevance for much longer time scales . in this scenario ,",
    "the critical temperature @xmath33 of mode coupling theory is associated to the dynamical freezing temperature of mean field spin models . in a purely mean field ( or , in other words , ideal mode - coupling )",
    "situation , the system would be out of equilibrium at all temperatures below @xmath33 .",
    "of course , real systems can still be equilibrated below @xmath33 , as `` hopping processes '' allow a relaxation that is not described by mode - coupling theory ( at least in its ideal version ) . hence in real experiments ( or in our system ,",
    "if we could allow for longer simulation times ) these systems will show only interrupted aging , i.e. aging for short waiting times and no aging at long waiting times .",
    "however , we have shown that if the system was artificially driven into a nonequilibrium situation , its `` short time aging '' can be described reasonably well within the framework of mean - field / mode - coupling theories .",
    "we may here draw a parallel with the fact that , in equilibrium , below @xmath33 , when the @xmath2 ( terminal ) relaxation becomes dominated by hopping processes , the @xmath1 ( intermediate times ) relaxation is still very well accounted for by ideal mode coupling theory @xcite .",
    "it is then quite tempting to speculate that for any `` fragile '' system ( i.e. a system in which hopping processes are not too strong , so that mode coupling theory accounts well for the dynamics close to @xmath33 ) quenched below its glass transition , the mean - field / mode - coupling description will be relevant for a large fraction of the aging process .",
    "this should be particularly relevant in systems where hopping processes are known to be weak , like colloidal suspensions .",
