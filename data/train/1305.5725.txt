    "we investigate the weak convergence in long - time of the following so - called self - stabilizing process :    @xmath0    here , @xmath1 denotes the convolution .",

    "indeed , we remark : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the underlying measurable space .",
    "this kind of processes were introduced by mckean , see  @xcite or @xcite . here",
    ", we will make some smoothness assumptions on the interaction potential  @xmath8 .",
    "let just note that it is possible to consider nonsmooth @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath8 is the heaviside step function and @xmath9 , ( [ eqintroinit ] ) is the burgers equation ; see  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath10 , and without confining potential , it is the oelschlger equation , studied in  @xcite .",
    "the particle @xmath2 which verifies ( [ eqintroinit ] ) can be seen as one particle in a continuous mean - field system of an infinite number of particles .",
    "the mean - field system that we will consider is a random dynamical system like @xmath11 where the @xmath12 brownian motions @xmath13 are independents .",
    "mean - field systems are the subject of a rich literature ; see  @xcite for the large deviations for @xmath14 and  @xcite under weak assumptions on @xmath4 and @xmath8 . for applications ,",
    "see  @xcite for social interactions or @xcite for the stochastic partial differential equations .",
    "the link between the self - stabilizing process and the mean - field system when @xmath12 goes to @xmath15 is called the propagation of chaos ; see @xcite under lipschitz properties ;  @xcite if @xmath4 is a constant ; @xcite or  @xcite when both potentials are convex ;  @xcite for a more precise result ;  @xcite or  @xcite for a sharp estimate ;  @xcite for a uniform result in time in the nonuniformly convex case .",
    "equation ( [ eqintromeanfield ] ) can be rewritten in the following way : @xmath16 where the @xmath17th coordinate of @xmath18 ( resp . , @xmath19 )",

    "as noted in  @xcite , the potential @xmath24 converges toward a functional  @xmath25 acting on the measures .",
    "a perturbation ( proportional to @xmath3 ) of @xmath25 will play the central role in the article .",
    "as observed in  @xcite , the empirical law of the mean - field system can be seen as a perturbation of the law of the diffusion ( [ eqintroinit ] ) .",
    "consequently , the long - time behavior of @xmath26 that we study in this paper provides some consequences on the exit time for the particle system ( [ eqintromeanfield ] ) .",
    "also , the convergence plays an important role in the exit problem for the self - stabilizing process since the exit time is strongly linked to the drift according to the kramers law ( see  @xcite or  @xcite ) which converges toward a homogeneous function if the law of the process converges toward a stationary measure .",
    "let us recall briefly some of the previous results on diffusions like ( [ eqintroinit ] ) .",
    "the existence problem has been investigated by two different methods .",
    "the first one consists in the application of a fixed point theorem ; see  @xcite or @xcite in the nonconvex case .",
    "the other consists of a propagation of chaos ; see , for example ,  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proved in theorem 2.13 in  @xcite that there is a unique strong solution .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the author proved  by using weyl s lemma  that the law of the unique strong solution @xmath27 admits a @xmath28-continuous density @xmath29 with respect to the lebesgue measure for all @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , this density satisfies a nonlinear partial differential equation of the following type : @xmath31 it is then possible to study equations like ( [ eqintropde ] ) by probabilistic methods which involve diffusions ( [ eqintroinit ] ) or ( [ eqintromeanfield ] ) ; see  @xcite .",
    "reciprocally , equation ( [ eqintropde ] ) is a useful tool for characterizing the stationary measure(s ) and the long - time behavior ; see  @xcite . in  @xcite , in the nonconvex case , by using ( [ eqintropde ] ) , it has been proved that the diffusion ( [ eqintroinit ] ) admits at least three stationary measures under assumptions easy to verify .",
    "one is symmetric , and the two others are not .",
    "moreover , theorem  3.2 in  @xcite states the thirdness of the stationary measures if @xmath32 is convex and @xmath33 is linear .",
    "this nonuniqueness prevents the long - time behavior from being as intuitive as in the case of unique stationary measure .",
    "the work in  @xcite and  @xcite provides some estimates of the small - noise asymptotic of these three stationary measures .",
    "in particular , the convergence toward dirac measures and its rate of convergence have been investigated .",
    "this will be one of the two main tools for obtaining the convergence .",
    "convergence for ( [ eqintroinit ] ) is not a new subject . in @xcite , if @xmath4 is identically equal to  @xmath34 , the authors proved the convergence toward the stationary measure by using an ultracontractivity property , a poincar inequality and a comparison lemma for processes .",
    "the ultracontractivity property still holds if @xmath4 is not convex by using the results in  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to conserve the poincar inequality by using the theorem of muckenhoupt ( see  @xcite ) instead of the bakry  emery theorem .",
    "but , the comparison lemma needs some convexity properties .",
    "however , it is possible to apply these results if the initial law is symmetric in the synchronized case ( @xmath35 ) ; see theorem  7.10 in  @xcite .",
    "another method consists of using the propagation of chaos in order to derive the convergence of the self - stabilizing process from the one of the mean - field system .",
    "however , we shall use it independently of the time and the classical result which is on a finite interval of time is not sufficiently strong .",
    "cattiaux , guillin and malrieu proceeded a uniform propagation of chaos in  @xcite and obtained the convergence in the convex case , including the nonuniformly strictly convex case .",
    "see also  @xcite . nevertheless , according to proposition 5.17 and remark 5.18 in  @xcite , it is impossible to find a general result of uniform propagation of chaos . in the synchronized case ,",
    "if the initial law is symmetric , it is possible to find such a uniform propagation of chaos ; see theorems 7.11 and 7.12 in  @xcite .",
    "the method that we will use in this paper is based on the one of @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for the convex case . in the nonconvex case ,",
    "carrillo , mccann and villani provide the convergence in  @xcite under two restrictions : the center of mass is fixed and @xmath36 ( that means it is the synchronized case ) .    however , by combining the results in  @xcite with the work of  @xcite ( and the more rigorous proofs in  @xcite about the free - energy ) , we will be able to prove the convergence in a more general setting .",
    "the principal tool of the paper is the monotonicity of the free - energy along the trajectories of ( [ eqintropde ] ) .",
    "first , we introduce the following functional : @xmath37 this quantity appears intuitively as the limit of the potential in ( [ eqintromeanfield ] ) for @xmath38 .",
    "we consider now the free - energy of the self - stabilizing process  ( [ eqintroinit ] ) , @xmath39 for all measures @xmath40 which are absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "we can note that @xmath27 satisfies this hypothesis for all @xmath30 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after presenting the assumptions",
    ", we will state the first results , in particular , the convergence of a subsequence @xmath41 .",
    "this subconvergence will be used for improving the results about the thirdness of the stationary measures .",
    "then , we will give the main statement which is the convergence toward a stationary measure , briefly discuss the assumptions of the theorem and give the proof .",
    "subsequently , we will study the basins of attraction by two different methods and prove that these basins are not reduced to a single point .",
    "finally , we postpone four results in the annex , including proposition  [ propafm ] which extends the classical higher - bound for the moments of the self - stabilizing processes .",
