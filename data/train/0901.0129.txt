    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of solute - solvent systems in chemistry and biology require accurate computation of electrostatic forces in order to obtain meaningful results . for practical purposes , computational efficiency is also essential , and various formulations exist that strive to achieve a balance between these two requirements .",
    "the explicit solvent methods simulate behaviour of each single solvent molecule which may be prohibitively expensive for a system of reasonable dimensions .",
    "in addition to having high computational costs , explicit solvent methods are usually tailored for reproducing one of the many physical properties of the solvent and therefore may not be well suited for a general description of solute - solvent systems ( see @xcite for reviews and performance analyses ) .",
    "the alternative approach is to treat the solvent as a dielectric continuum , and the solute as a different dielectric object in the solvent .",
    "the dielectric properties of the solvent and the solute usually serve as parameters of the model . in the literature this scheme is known as the implicit or continuum solvent method ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "computations based on these methods are inherently faster while comparable in accuracy with those using explicit methods , at least in the situations when interactions between solute and solvent molecules can be neglected . for reasons of computational efficiency ,",
    "many of the implemented implicit solvent methods make use of assumptions which prevent improvement in accuracy even as computational resources increase .",
    "the so - called generalized born model is a good example of such uncontrolled approximations ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .    to achieve controllable accuracy ,",
    "we have recently proposed a novel scheme @xcite based on determining surface charges satisfying the displacement field boundary condition . with this scheme",
    ", one can achieve any level of accuracy permitted by the available computing power , while remaining computationally more efficient than explicit solvent methods .",
    "the main idea is to treat the induced surface charges at the boundaries as the variables to be solved for .",
    "this makes the potential , expressed directly in terms of the induced surface charge density , continuous at the boundary .",
    "therefore only the displacement field boundary condition remains , and it leads to a set of algebraic equations for the surface charge densities .",
    "the potential is obtained at no additional cost .",
    "one of the seeming oversimplifications in the implicit solvent methods is the assumption of a sharp boundary between the solute and solvent .",
    "it is known , for example , that the solute ( e.g. , proteins ) may strongly interact with the surrounding solvent molecules producing the so - called hydration layer(s ) @xcite . to determine electrostatic forces acting on a protein coated with such hydration layers",
    ", one needs to find induced charges in a spatially varying dielectric medium . in this paper",
    "we develop a rigorous framework , based on functional minimization , for handling spatially varying dielectrics .",
    "functional variation is a powerful approach in modern physics . despite common use in quantum electrodynamics , variational techniques in classical electrostatics",
    "are relatively rare and focus mainly on boundary value problems for linear dielectrics @xcite .",
    "it has long been a textbook fact that the true electrostatic potential minimizes the system s energy for a given configuration of charges @xcite .",
    "a suitable energy functional can be constructed in general for any system of continuous media including systems with inhomogeneous and nonlinear dielectric properties .",
    "for instance , free energy functionals became an important tool in description of electrolyte solutions within the mean - field ( poisson - boltzmann ) approach ( see a recent paper @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "from our viewpoint the electrostatic potential is not the best choice for a minimization variable as it contains information about both the cause and effect , i.e. the source and induced charge densities . moreover constitutive relations must be assumed ( as in @xcite ) . and finally this approach depends on prior knowledge of the green s function with boundary conditions suitable for the given problem .",
    "in contrast , we use the polarization as the fundamental function as was proposed by marcus over fifty years ago @xcite , albeit with a different functional .",
    "the constitutive relations are then obtained as a result of minimization of the energy functional .",
    "the only boundary condition needed is that the potential goes to zero sufficiently rapidly ( like inverse of the distance ) at large distances .    in marcus s formulation @xcite ,",
    "the electric field and electric polarization were strongly motivated as the vectors defining the electric state of the system .",
    "this formulation was aimed at the processes ( charge transfer chemical reactions ) which happen on a much shorter time scale than the molecular rearrangement in response to the changing electric field .",
    "marcus attempted to deal with this problem by dividing the polarization into a fast reacting part that is proportional to the local electric field and slowly reacting part that is not a function of the local electric field . as a result ,",
    "the free energy functional derived by marcus contains several electric fields and polarizations of various origins .",
    "a physically sound free energy functional was proposed by felderhof @xcite in the context of a discussion of thermal fluctuations of the polarization and magnetization in dielectric magnetic media . however",
    ", a free energy of this type seems not to have been adopted for calculation of electrostatic fields until recently .",
    "an example of numerical implementation using felderhof s scheme can be found in @xcite .",
    "there , the polarization vector field was expanded in a plane waves basis set .",
    "the energy functional is then an ordinary function of the expansion coefficients which , in turn , become the variational parameters of a standard multidimensional optimization problem .",
    "fast fourier transforms were used to go from the real space to the reciprocal space representations .",
    "an approach close to felderhof s scheme was also taken in @xcite where a thermodynamic functional was constructed with the polarization as the independent function . however , the techniques used there are suitable for systems with sharp boundaries only ( the susceptibility is not considered to be a function of coordinates , but is rather treated as a piecewise constant ) .    in this paper",
    "we construct an energy minimization scheme suitable for a rigorous treatment of systems with spatially varying dielectric functions , be they linear or nonlinear . in the case of linear dielectrics ,",
    "our functional is equivalent to that proposed by felderhof @xcite . in section [ funda ]",
    "we give the details of the formulation and describe a systematic protocol for obtaining the total charge density . to show the versatility of the scheme",
    "we apply it in section [ examples ] to systems with sharp boundaries for which the exact solutions ( or the exact equations governing the exact solutions ) are known . in section [ numerics ] we present numerical results for the case of two interacting dielectric charged spheres ( solutes ) placed in a dielectric solvent .",
    "we discuss the differences in force and energy between the situations with sharp and smooth boundaries .",
    "finally we conclude with a discussion assessing the usefulness of the method .",
    "electrostatic cgs units are used throughout .",
    "polarization is the response of a dielectric medium to an applied electric field .",
    "the phenomenon is usually visualized as the appearance of an induced dipole moment due to a small shift in the relative positions of the positive and negative charge centers at the atomic scale @xcite .",
    "the shift may be either translational or rotational or both , depending on the quantum mechanical and electromagnetic interactions at the atomic level .",
    "the applied electric fields must be weak enough not to split the atoms or molecules into their constituents .",
    "the system is in a state of equilibrium under the external electromagnetic and the intrinsic restoring forces .",
    "quantitatively , polarization @xmath0 is the density of induced dipole moment at location @xmath1 .",
    "this density in classical electrodynamics is defined through averaging of dipole moments of constituent atoms / molecules in a small volume centered around @xmath1 .",
    "the amount of polarization depends on the applied force and the susceptibility of the medium to such forces .",
    "determination of the susceptibility of the medium ( or rather the intrinsic restoring force in the medium ) is the subject of quantum mechanics rather than classical electrodynamics .",
    "polarization is thus a classical / macroscopic variable summarizing quantum mechanical effects at the atomic / microscopic level .",
    "therefore , we choose the polarization vector field @xmath0 and electric field @xmath2 , in contrast to the more commonly used pair @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as our fundamental variables .",
    "this choice provides a simpler connection to the parameters determined in microscopic physics .",
    "we express the energy as a functional @xmath4 $ ] u[p ] = u_c[p ] + w[p ] , where @xmath5 $ ] is the electrostatic energy of interaction of all charges present in the system , and @xmath6 $ ] is the energy required to create the given polarization vector field @xmath0 .    from simple considerations",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the variation of polarization in the vicinity of a point is equivalent to the presence of an induced charge density @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the total charge density @xmath8 in the medium is a sum of the free charge density @xmath9 and @xmath10 : ( r)=(r ) + ( r ) .",
    "then ; otherwise , we indicate the variable by a subscript . ]",
    "u_c[p ] = d r d r .",
    "[ uc ]    note first that we do not include any separate term for induced surface charges as was done in some of the earlier formulations of functional minimization @xcite .",
    "the volume charge density is the most general form of charge density possible .",
    "secondly , ( [ uc ] ) is the coulomb energy in vacuum and hence quite fundamental as opposed to the form with the dielectric constant of the material in the denominator used in some of the earlier works @xcite .",
    "the work functional @xmath6 $ ] should contain the intrinsic self interaction of the polarization vector field .",
    "here we consider only local contact terms for the intrinsic interactions .",
    "noting that the energy functional is a scalar and assuming @xmath11 symmetry , one can write the general work functional @xmath6 $ ] as a polynomial expansion in even powers of @xmath12 ( or the components @xmath13 ) . thus we may write ,    w[p ] = d r , [ wp ]    where the interaction tensors @xmath14 , @xmath15 , etc .",
    "describe the linear and nonlinear dielectric properties of the media , isotropic or anisotropic ( summation over repeated indices is assumed ) .",
    "the effective dielectric properties of the medium at the macroscopic level are now contained in these quantities .    we emphasize that @xmath4 $ ] is the actual energy functional unlike various other functionals proposed in the literature @xcite which yield the energy or free energy of the system only at equilibrium . the equilibrium distribution of polarization ( as well as induced charge distribution ) can be obtained by minimizing this energy functional with respect to the polarization . for",
    "any given external charge distribution and spatially varying dielectric susceptibilities one can obtain the solution analytically or numerically .",
    "we may truncate the series in ( [ wp ] ) at an order suitable for the problem at hand .",
    "for example , if the field is very weak we can retain only the quadratic term which corresponds to the case of linear dielectrics ( isotropy is also assumed for the sake of simplicity of presentation ) :    u[p ] = u_c[p ] + d r. [ functional ]    performing a functional variation with respect to the polarization vector @xmath12 , we arrive at an integro - differential equation defining the equilibrium polarization + _ r d r = 0 which implies [ key ] p(r ) = ( r ) d r = ( r ) e(r ) .",
    "thus the constitutive relation for a linear dielectric is obtained as a result of functional minimization , with the expansion coefficient @xmath16 turning out to be the dielectric susceptibility . inserting the equilibrium polarization ( [ key ] ) in ( [ functional ] ) results in the well known expression for the total energy of the system : u = ( r ) d r d r .",
    "[ energy ]    keeping two ( or more ) terms in the series ( [ wp ] ) introduces nonlinearity into the problem .",
    "the energy functional in this case is given by    u[p ] = u_c[p ] + d r + d r .",
    "performing a functional variation as above we now obtain    [ key1 ] p(r ) = ( r ) e(r ) - 2 ( r ) .",
    "given that the first term on the right hand side is the dominant one , we can obtain the solution via iteration .",
    "the first approximation would be the same as the result for the linear dielectrics . substituting it back into ( [ key1 ] )",
    ", we obtain at the second order of approximation ,    \\(r ) = ( r ) e(r ) - 2 ( r )",
    ".    one can continue with this to obtain a series of terms with higher and higher powers of @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "this gives the desired result for nonlinear dielectrics .",
    "we should mention once more that this solution is true for weak fields so that the higher order terms are successively weaker . to ensure this condition we require @xmath18 to be true to any order of approximation .",
    "let us now solve ( [ key ] ) for the case of linear dielectrics .",
    "we simplify the analysis by choosing the ( scalar ) induced density @xmath19 as our variable .    using the relation _",
    "r = 4(r - r ) ,    we obtain from ( [ key ] )    p ( r ) = ( r ) dr + 4(r ) which implies [ rho_i ] ( r ) ( r ) = - ( r ) dr - 4(r ) ( r ) ,    where @xmath20 .",
    "equation ( [ rho_i ] ) relates @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we may rewrite this equation as    [ rho_t.1 ] ( r ) ( r ) = ( r ) - ( r ) ( r ) dr or [ rho_t.2 ] ( r ) = ( r ) ( r ) - 1(r)(r ) ( r ) dr    this integral equation is the most general equation for total charge density in linear dielectric media .",
    "note that it is a simple scalar equation for the induced charge @xmath21 , as opposed to ( [ key ] ) , a vector equation for the polarization @xmath23 whose numerical solution also requires calculation of @xmath24 .",
    "once ( [ key ] ) is solved for @xmath25 , the polarization field is straightforwardly obtained by substituting @xmath25 for @xmath26 in ( [ key ] ) .",
    "the advantages of switching to the induced charge persist even in the case of nonlinear dielectrics .    for a system with uniform susceptibility",

    "the second term in ( [ rho_t.2 ] ) generates induced charges due to non - uniformity of dielectric medium . in the case of a sharp boundary , the proper limit of this term gives rise to surface charges .",

    "two charged identical spheres the correction is about 10% .",
    "the formalism has various potential applications in modeling electrostatic interactions between solvated molecules : it enables one to go beyond the widely used simplification of atoms and molecules as dielectric balls immersed in a dielectric solvent , as was first suggested by born in the early twenties of the last century @xcite .",
    "for example , the description of an aqueous solvent as a continuous and homogeneous dielectric medium fails to account for the strong dielectric response of water molecules around charges . normally , charged ions and surfaces give rise to hydration layers by orienting and displacing surrounding water molecules .",
    "these hydration phenomena are very important in many biological processes such as protein folding , protein crystallization , and interactions between charged biopolymers inside the cell . with our formalism",
    "one can now consider arbitrary structures for such hydration layers and arrive at a possibly more realistic and reliable analysis of the molecular mechanisms in bio - chemical interactions",
    ".    applied to md simulations , this formulation is still an implicit solvent scheme , and the position - dependent susceptibility is therefore a model parameter ( indeed , the only one ) . to obtain an estimate of the macroscopic dielectric susceptibility at the molecular level or at the intermolecular boundaries one has to explore physics at the atomic level and introduce some coarse graining .",
    "given that the dielectric susceptibility is related to the charge fluctuations as a response to external perturbations , one can estimate susceptibilites through the study of linear / nonlinear response .",
    "for example , the dielectric susceptibility can be related to the correlations of the net system dipole moment and local polarization density @xcite .",
    "a fully quantum mechanical treatment of solvation of biological systems might be hindered by limits of numerical accuracy @xcite and will demand much more computational power than currently available .",
    "we believe that quantum mechanics , in particular , density functional theory , can in principle be used to calculate the local dielectric susceptibility which in turn should be used as input for the implicit solvent methods , such as the one described in this paper .",
