    "dissipative wave phenomena in nonlinear media with complex parameters are attracting nowadays a great deal of attention .",
    "they appear naturally in optics of active media like , for example cavities , active fibers , etc .",
    "@xcite and in quantum mechanics when inelastic interactions of particles with external forces are accounted  @xcite .",
    "more recently , there has been a particular interest in the dynamics of nonlinear waves in periodic complex potentials due to possible applications to matter waves in absorbing optical lattices  @xcite and to periodic modulations of a complex refractive index in nonlinear optics  @xcite . in this last case special attention",
    "was devoted to the so called @xmath0 potentials ( i.e. complex potentials for which the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation becomes invariant under the parity and time - reversal symmetry)@xcite , whose remarkable linear properties are presently intensively investigated  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that in nonlinear media with @xmath0-symmetric _ linear _ damping and amplifications , stationary localized and periodic states may exist @xcite .",
    "the stability problem of these nonlinear structures is still an open problem .",
    "also , it is not investigated so far whether similar structures with real energies could also exist in a general complex potential , thanks to the balance between nonlinearity , dispersion , gain and dissipation .    in the present paper",
    "we shall address these problems with a twofold aim .",
    "from one side we derive a set of exact soliton solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with complex potentials and show that the nonlinearity management technique of the gain - loss profile can be an effective mechanism for providing stability .",
    "we find exact solutions by adopting an inverse engineering approach , developed in  @xcite for the case of the conservative nls equation with periodic coefficients .",
    "more specifically we assume a specific pattern for the solutions and determine a posteriori the potentials which can sustain such pattern as a solution . using this approach",
    "we determine a general class of potentials which may support dissipative periodic waves and solitons in the form of elliptic functions .",
    "we show that some of these solutions my be stable with respect to small perturbations .    from the other side ,",
    "we show that the derived solutions can be used to explore interesting dynamical behaviors of localized modes of the complex nls equation . to this",
    "regard we investigate stable breather solutions which originate from localized exact solutions when a parabolic trap is switched on as additional real potential . using the strength of the parabolic trap as a parameter",
    "we show the occurrence of a bifurcation from an attractor center , corresponding to a stationary soliton , to a limit cycle , corresponding to a stable breather mode .",
    "the stability of stationary periodic solutions , single hump solitons , and breathers opens the possibility to experimentally observe such waves both in nonlinear optics and in bec with optical lattices in presence of dissipative effects .",
    "we remark that although the determination of the potentials from the solutions is opposite to what usually occurs in practical contexts where potentials are a priori fixed , there are physical situations in which an inverse approach can be experimentally implemented .",
    "an example of this is the case of a bose - einstein condensates nonlinear optical lattices which is produced by means of spatial modulations of the interatomic scattering length . in the mean field approximation",
    "the system is described by the nls equation with spatially modulated nonlinearity of the type considered in this paper . since the modulation of the scattering length ( nonlinearity ) in a real experiment is controlled by external magnetic fields via a feshbach resonance , in principle one can construct arbitrary potentials to support specific prepared states , implementing thus an inverse engineering approach .",
    "another situation , where the potential can be adjusted in accordance with the profile designed a priori , is the nonlinear optics of waveguide arrays , where the thermo - optics effect is employed using heaters producing the temperature gradients properly distributed in space .",
    "this gives the hope that some of the exact solutions reported in this paper could be indeed observed in experimentally contexts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model equation and explain the inverse method used to determine the solutions . in section iii",
    "we apply the method to the case in which there are only linear real and complex potentials . as an example we derive solutions in the potential which has the @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "we show that some of these solutions can be stable , what is confirmed by both the linear stability analysis and by numerical time evolutions of the complex nls equation .",
    "in section iv we do similar studies for the case of nonlinear lattices . in section",
    "v we show an example of exact stable solutions in correspondence of more general potentials , while in section vi we use this solution to numerically show the existence of dissipative breathers in the complex nls equation with additional real parabolic trap .",
    "finally , in section vii the main results of the paper are briefly summarized .",
    "we consider the generalized nls equation with varying in space complex linear potential , @xmath1 , and complex nonlinearity parameter @xmath2 ( hereafter @xmath3re@xmath4 and @xmath5im@xmath4 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 and is introduced in an explicit form in order to facilitate transition to the case of the homogeneous nonlinearity ( just putting @xmath8 ) . in the particular case of the @xmath0 symmetry",
    "the invariance imposes restrictions on the linear and complex potentials : namely @xmath9 must be even and @xmath10 must be odd functions of the space variable , respectively",
    ".    we will be interested in the solutions of the form @xmath11\\right ) , $ ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are real amplitude and inhomogeneous phase of the mode . substituting this ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ sys ] ) we obtain the system of equations @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "let us now assume that linear and nonlinear potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given , and pose the problem of designing dissipative terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 to obtain a given solution @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this choice is only for illustration proposes and any pair of the four functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be chosen as a priori given .    as first step ,",
    "we prove that this is indeed possible , provided that @xmath12 is a bounded function are singular , further investigations are required ] satisfying the condition @xmath22 . indeed , after dividing ( [ sys2 ] ) by @xmath23 we obtain and explicit expression for the velocity @xmath24 as it is clear this equation always has solutions for sufficiently large frequency @xmath25 .",
    "next , substituting ( [ auxil_1 ] ) in ( [ sys3 ] ) we find the expression for the dissipative potentials @xmath26 if we want to consider only nonsingular dissipative terms , then we have to impose one more constrain on the field @xmath23 , which must be considered together with ( [ cond1 ] ) @xmath27 and assume @xmath28 to be a smooth function of @xmath29 .    in what follows",
    "we limit ourselves only by this kind of dissipation .",
    "this allows us to indicate immediately several types of admissible solutions :    * _ type 1 _ : @xmath23 is bounded and has no zeros .",
    "these , for example are functions like dn@xmath30 etc . * _ type 2 _ : @xmath23 is bounded , has no zeros in any finite domain , but decays as @xmath31 .",
    "these are solutions like @xmath32 , @xmath33 , etc",
    ".    for these types of solutions condition ( [ cond2 ] ) is automatically satisfied if we restrict our consideration to bounded conservative potentials .",
    "further , we relax the requirements for @xmath23 allowing it to have zeros but we require that condition ( [ cond2 ] ) holds",
    ". then the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) leads to another type of solutions :    * _ type 3 _ : @xmath23 has zeros which coincide with those of @xmath34 . these are solutions of the type @xmath35sn@xmath36 , etc .",
    "all solutions reported below belong to one of these three types .",
    "we would like to notice here that @xmath23 must not necessarily be taken in the form of elliptic functions .",
    "we choose elliptical functions just as an example representing periodic solutions with a given parameter ( the elliptic modulus ) .",
    "alternatively we could choose the field @xmath23 in the form of , for instance , gaussian function .",
    "another remark we would like to make here is that if @xmath23 is a solution of the homogeneous nls equation , then the coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 are constants and one has to determine @xmath39 from either eq .",
    "( [ sys3 ] ) or ( [ w ] ) for a chosen @xmath40 .",
    "notice , that this procedure implies some freedom , in the sense that one can also think of determining @xmath40 for chosen @xmath39 .",
    "however the latter might require some additional conditions on the linear dissipative potential @xmath39 because @xmath41-like solutions have zeros .",
    "in general terms this case is mentioned in the paper as a solution of type 3 .    in closing this section",
    "we remark that from the above analysis it follows that for all constructed potentials one can define a function @xmath42 such that the nonlinear solutions are also solutions of the _ linear _ problem @xmath43 .",
    "this observation leads to an immediate interesting conclusion .",
    "assume that @xmath44 and choose @xmath45 .",
    "then , for a periodic functions @xmath37 , the solution @xmath23 is nothing but a _",
    "linear bloch function _ of the linear potential @xmath46 . indeed , in this case @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which means that condition ( [ cond2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "according the scheme described above one can design the dissipation of the system in a way to provide the any desired field configuration supported by the given linear and nonlinear conservative potentials .",
    "while the zoo of available nonlinear patterns is not limited , physically the most relevant cases are those corresponding to the stable solutions .",
    "below we present several examples of the stable field distribution , completing the analysis with a contrasting behavior of unstable patterns .    before",
    "going into detail we also notice that the diversity of the physical parameters at hand makes the analysis of particular cases cumbersome .",
    "it turns out , however that at least one of them can be scaled out .",
    "in particular , the amplitude of the nonlinear conservative potential can be scaled out by the renormalization of the amplitude of the solution .",
    "therefore in what follows this value is chosen to be fixed .",
    "we start the analysis of the particular cases with the natural test example where @xmath12 is chosen to be a solution of the standard nls equation , i.e. having constant real linear and nonlinear potentials .",
    "we respectively set @xmath49const and @xmath50 . by means of straightforward algebra one obtains , from ( [ auxil_1 ] ) and ( [ w ] ) , the relation @xmath51 .",
    "as it is clear this relation includes the particular case @xmath52 , which precisely corresponds to the integrable nls equation .",
    "note , however , that the obtained relation allows for a general class of equations , all having the chosen function @xmath12 as a solution and the ratio of the linear and nonlinear complex parts of the potential fixed to @xmath53 .",
    "now we turn to the case where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is a real constant , which will be chosen to be @xmath56 , i.e. to the case where the inhomogeneity is only linear and nonlinear gain or loss are absent .",
    "the first example is a cnoidal wave ( solution of _ type 3 _ according to the classification introduced in the previous section ) @xmath57 embedded in the linear lattice potential @xmath58 with a constant focusing nonlinearity @xmath59 . requiring @xmath60 ,",
    "the respective pattern can be created with only the help of the linear dissipative term @xmath61 as it follows from ( [ w ] ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic velocity of the obtained solution is given by @xmath62 .",
    "the phase is : @xmath63 .",
    "the obtained complex potential @xmath64 is @xmath0-invariant .",
    "as it follows from ( [ case_1a ] ) the nonlinear pattern @xmath12 exists only for the amplitudes above the threshold @xmath65 and grows with the intensity of the dissipative part . if @xmath66 then the solution is periodic . however if @xmath67 then our solution is localized and has no zeros .",
    "so if @xmath67 then the solution belongs to _ type 2_. the typical field distributions for solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "let s now consider the stability of the solutions .",
    "to do this we linearize eq .",
    "( [ sys ] ) around the examined soliton solution .",
    "the solution of the linearized equation can be sought in the form @xmath68 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath69 of the small perturbations has both a continuous part , associated to non - localized eigenfunction and a discrete part associated to localized modes @xmath70 .",
    "the existence of @xmath69 with positive real part means that the corresponding eigenmode will grow exponentially in time and , thus , the examined solution will be unstable . in this paper",
    "we study the stability numerically substituting the spatial derivatives by their discrete analogs ( we used 5-point approximation ) .",
    "then the problem of finding the eigenvalues @xmath69 governing the stability of the solution is reduced to the diagonlization of a matrix .    discussing the stability",
    "we should first notice that if @xmath71 then eq . ( [ sys ] ) is nothing but the standard nls equation .",
    "the spectrum of small perturbation on the background of the schrdinger soliton has two pairs of degenerate zero eigenvalues corresponding to phase and translational symmetries .",
    "the introduction of a nonzero @xmath64 preserves the phase invariance but breaks the translational symmetry . in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we show the evolution of the eigenvalues in the complex plane as the linear potentials are increased with the ratio @xmath72 kept constant .",
    "we see that by increasing the potentials away from zero , the splitting of the zero eigenvalue present at @xmath71 gives a pair of eigenvalues lying in the gap of the continuum which move in opposite directions along the imaginary axis without producing any instability of the solution .",
    "we have therefore that for sufficiently small @xmath73 the soliton solution is always stable . however , when the pair of the eigenvalues reach the border and collide with the continuum they generate a quartet of complex eigenvalues with two unstable modes generating an oscillatory instability of the soliton .",
    "the development of the instability is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the instability of a soliton with the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the instability results in an infinitely growing localized peak in the area where the gain is positive . the formation of this peak is clearly seen on the picture .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the decay of a periodic structure because of the instability present at the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( let us mention that at this parameters localized solution is stable ) .",
    "one can see that the instability is of the same kind and results in the formation of growing peaks in the areas of positive gain .",
    "the solution ( [ cn_focus ] ) is periodic and describes a pattern with spatially alternating currents , such that the average hydrodynamic velocity is zero ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to present an example where a pattern corresponds to a nonzero currents . to this end",
    "we consider the same wave ( [ cn_focus ] ) but now in the potential @xmath78 and require the wave amplitude to be @xmath79 and frequency to be @xmath80 .",
    "this immediately leads to the dissipative part of the potential in the form @xmath81 now the hydrodynamic velocity is given by @xmath82 and the phase is : @xmath83,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind .",
    "the obtained solutions can be either stable or unstable , the potential and field distributions for a stable solutions are shown in fig.[figure4 ] .",
    "let us now turn to the case of defocusing medium : @xmath85 and concentrate on the conservative potential in the form @xmath86 .",
    "a stable wave can be chosen in the form @xmath87 and is induced by the spatial distributions of the dissipation and losses @xmath88 one can see that is solution is of _ type 1_. the frequency of the solutions and the hydrodynamic velocity are given by @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the phase then is readily obtained from the velocity as @xmath91 .",
    "fig.[figure5 ] illustrates the potential and the field distribution for a stable solution of such a kind .",
    "let us now turn to the case where the linear potential is absent , i.e. @xmath92 , and consider spatial dependent nonlinearity .",
    "respectively it is considered that @xmath17 is given and the problem to design the dissipative term inducing the given field pattern is posed .",
    "notice that in general the conservative nonlinear part can not change sign , i.e. the medium can not be focusing in some regions of the domain and defocusing in others .",
    "we consider the case of a defocusing nonlinearity @xmath93 and look for a solution of the type ( [ dn ] ) with @xmath94 ( a solution belonging to _ type 1 _ ) embedded in the potential @xmath95 then the hydrodynamic velocity is given by @xmath96 and imposing the frequency @xmath97 nonlinear dissipative part is computed from ( [ w ] ) to be @xmath98 the profiles of the nonlinear potential , the distribution of the field and the development of the instability for the solution ( [ eq21 ] ) are shown in fig.[figure6 ] .    in the case of",

    ". then , from ( [ w ] ) we get @xmath102 the phase is : @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "finally we consider a more general case when there exists a linear real potential with complex linear and nonlinear inhomogeneous dissipative terms .",
    "we let @xmath85 and consider the pattern ( [ dn ] ) loaded in the linear lattice @xmath104 . then requiring @xmath105",

    "[ figure7 ] .",
    "the solution can be stable in its existence @xmath109 with @xmath110 the amplitude of the real linear potential .",
    "the evolution is shown in panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] .",
    "in the limit of infinite period ( e.g. for modulus @xmath67 ) we have that the potentials in eqs .",
    "( [ eq21])-([eq21a ] ) give rise to a stable localized hump in the sense that any perturbation of it will relax back to the stationary state .",
    "stable solutions of this type correspond to attractive centers .",
    "it is possible to destabilize it into limit cycles and create stable dissipative breathers , by analogy with the bifurcation of a dissipative soliton to a pulsating soliton in the complex ginzburg - landau equation  @xcite ( similar studies can be done with other types of soliton solutions given above ) .",
    "we take this solution as initial condition of the complex nls with a parabolic trap potential added to the real linear potential , e.g. we take @xmath111 , keeping all other potentials the same .",
    "we use the frequency of the parabolic trap as a parameter to induce the transition into a limit cycle .",
    "for @xmath112 small enough the extra potential will act as a small perturbation allowing the solution to relax to a nearby stationary solution of similar shape .",
    "we find , however , that when @xmath112 exceeds a critical value the solution bifurcates from a single hump to a double humps shape which is stable and stationary e.g. it still corresponds to an attractive center . in the panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] we show the shapes of the solutions taken before and after the bifurcation , while in panel ( b ) we depict the relaxation dynamics of the center of the two humps solution toward the new equilibrium center . as we increase the strength of the parabolic trap the relaxation time increases until it becomes a regular periodic oscillation ( see panel ( d ) ) .",
