    "standard discussions of the mott - hubbard transition are generally concerned with lattices of equivalent sites . at zero temperature , the metal - insulator transition develops when the on - site electron - electron repulsion @xmath4 reaches some critical value @xmath5 which , usually , also corresponds to the onset of characteristic magnetic correlations . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the less common case where the system is ionic , encompassing `` anions '' and `` cations '' .",
    "earlier workers , including nagaosa and takimoto@xcite , and egami , ishihara and tachiki @xcite considered the simplest two - site ionic generalization of the hubbard model ( henceforth dubbed ionic hubbard model , ihm ) , which exhibits the transition from a band insulator to a mott insulator .",
    "such a system is , in the absence of electron - electron repulsions , @xmath4 = 0 , a regular band insulator .",
    "as @xmath4 increases above some critical value @xmath5 , a band insulator - mott - hubbard insulator transition is expected to take place . when @xmath4 is sufficiently large , the inequivalence between anion and cation should in fact become irrelevant , and the ground state of a large @xmath4 system of equivalent sites is mott - insulating , with antiferromagnetic correlations . however , owing to the residual inequivalence of the two ionic sites , it will also exhibit other properties , which have only partly been explored so far .",
    "of special interest is the anomalous behaviour of the polarization of the ionic solid across the transition .",
    "a very interesting quantity in this regard is the born effective charge @xmath6 associated with an infinitesimal `` dimerizing '' displacement of the ionic lattice , corresponding to a frozen @xmath7 optical phonon .",
    "resta and sorella @xcite studied the ihm in @xmath2 using lanczos diagonalization and found , by the berry phase method , very striking indications of a polarization anomaly at @xmath0 .",
    "ortiz , ordejn , martin and chiappe @xcite proposed a simple hartree - fock explanation to the anomaly , namely that at a first order magnetic transition between an af insulator and a band magnetic insulator , the polarization may also abruptly jump .",
    "a number of important questions are apparently still open at this stage , in particular    1 .   what is the physical origin of the polarization anomaly at the band - mott transition , and what is its connection with symmetry ? 2 .   what is the nature precisely at @xmath8 , of the `` threshold '' state between the band and the mott insulator ? 3 .",
    "how does the polarization anomaly depend on the dimensionality ?",
    "in particular , will it survive in 2d and 3d , and if so , with what strength ?",
    "4 .   bearing in mind that most experiments measure just only @xmath9 , can we identify a simple experimentally accessible quantity which could signal the @xmath6 anomaly in magnitude and sign ?    in this paper",
    "we set out to discuss principally these questions .",
    "we will do it by studying more closely the same simple ionic hubbard model @xcite , in particular by analysing the symmetry of its possible ground states , by calculating effective charges and excitation spectra , and generally by seeking to understand its properties by exact diagonalizations supplemented when necessary by the simple hartree - fock approximation .",
    "firstly , we find that the mott insulator does , for appropriate boundary conditions , possess odd symmetry under inversion , contrary to the ionic band insulator , which has even parity .",
    "secondly , hartree - fock reveals that one clue to the polarization anomaly lies in an effective reversal of the on - site energy offset ( accompanied with the vanishing of the associated band gap ) , taking place _ for the minority spin species only _ at @xmath5 .",
    "thirdly , in agreement with hartree - fock , exact results suggest that at @xmath5 not only the spin gap , but also the true charge gap vanishes , indicating a _ metallic _ `` threshold '' state poised precisely at the brink between the band insulator and the mott insulator .",
    "fourthly , a fresh study of two different 2d lattices , namely square and honeycomb , shows that a direct band insulator - mott hubbard insulator transition and the associated polarization anomaly may survive in higher dimensions too , particularly in the 2d honeycomb lattice . here , the anomaly is weaker than in d=1 ( a jump instead of a divergence )",
    ". finally , we propose the piezoelectric effect in a non - centrosymmetric lattice , here exemplified precisely by the 2d honeycomb lattice , as the experimentally accessible quantity that will directly and strikingly change sign at the band insulator - mott insulator transition .",
    "the polarization calculations are carried out using the berry phase technique , first introduced by king - smith and vanderbilt @xcite and by resta @xcite , and further extended to a general many - body case by ortiz and martin @xcite , and applied to the ihm by resta and sorella .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the ionic hubbard model and describe briefly the classical limit , @xmath10 , useful for understanding later the full quantum case . in section [ sec : magnetism ] we first present a discussion of the magnetic behavior expected by the model , followed by a more detailed discussion of symmetry , and by a finite - size study of the level crossings connected with the transition at @xmath5",
    ". section [ sec : hf ] contains the hartree - fock theory of the band- mott insulator transition , and of the polarization anomaly .",
    "section [ sec : manybody ] presents the full many - body calculation of the polarization , done by means of lanczos diagonalization plus berry phase , here specialized to the 2d honeycomb case , and finally in section [ sec : discussion ] we give a discussion of the possible detectability of the transition via the piezoelectric effect , followed by our general conclusions .",
    "we consider the hubbard hamiltonian in 1d ( linear chain ) and 2d bipartite lattices ( square and honeycomb lattices ) .",
    "all lattices being bipartite , they are composed of @xmath11 and @xmath12 sublattices . to simulate ionicity , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are made inequivalent by onsite energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively . because of the energy difference @xmath1 between the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 sublattices , the electron population of the @xmath11 sublattice is less than that of the @xmath12 sublattice for @xmath15 ( or viceversa for @xmath16 ) .",

    "when in need to distinguish between the number of spin up and spin down electrons , the ground state energy will be denoted by @xmath38 . unless otherwise specified @xmath39 .",
    "we shall study the charge gap and the spin gap of the system defined respectively as : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "+      it is instructive at the outset to consider what happens when all @xmath42 . as sketched in fig([class ] ) if we set the hopping @xmath43 in the hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) the model is classical .",
    "it has a first order transition at @xmath44 with a change of the macroscopic polarization per unit cell @xmath45 .",
    "both the charge and spin gaps are finite and coincide in the region @xmath46 where they are given by @xmath47 . for @xmath48 the charge gap remains finite @xmath49 while the spin gap vanishes .",
    "note that precisely at @xmath44 , where the transition takes place , both the charge and the spin gap vanish .",
    "this kind of transition s expected to persist for @xmath50 , where it takes a standard band insulator , with a charge and a spin gap , over to an antiferromagnetic insulator , with a charge gap , and gapless spin excitations for large @xmath4 .",
    "in this section we discuss the polarization properties of an electron system close to an antiferromagnetic transition .",
    "as discussed by ortiz and martin antiferromagnetism appears to play a crucial role and remarkably affects the behaviour of the polarization.@xcite    let us consider a finite electron hopping @xmath51 . for @xmath52 ,",
    "one electron per site , the model is in fact described by a completely filled , spin independent band , separated by a finite gap ( @xmath53 , for large @xmath1 ) from the second , empty band . in the opposite limit of large @xmath4 the standard strong coupling analysis of the hubbard model leads to a charge gap @xmath54 , and to the well known heisenberg hamiltonian @xcite @xmath55 for spins : @xmath56 with an antiferromagnetic superexchange coupling @xmath57 .",
    "the mapping to the heisenberg model implies that for large @xmath4 the model has gapless spin excitations . in one dimension",
    "they have been named `` spinons''@xcite , and can be derived from the exact bethe ansatz solution of the 1d heisenberg model.@xcite in higher dimensions , where antiferromagnetic long range order is believed to exist at @xmath58 in 2d @xcite and 3d@xcite , the gapless modes are spin waves .",
    "a band insulator - mott insulator transition should therefore occur at some finite coupling @xmath5 .",
    "of course , @xmath5 will differ from its classical value @xmath59 .",
    "there will be in general the possibility of intermediate metallic phases covering a range of @xmath4 values .",
    "even if the insulator - insulator transition is direct , quantum fluctuations may drive its character , for example from first order to second order , or else may split it into more than one transition @xcite . quantum antiferromagnets with long range order for @xmath60 ( or quasi long range order in one dimension ) can be described at the critical level , by the well known non linear sigma model , with action @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a unit vector describing the local orientation of the antiferromagnetic order parameter , and the coupling constant @xmath63 depends on the microscopic parameters @xmath64 of the model .",
    "this effective model is well known to have a second order transition predicting that a spin gap opens up continuously for @xmath65 , alias @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we will for simplicity assume in the following that the transition is unique and is always second order even though a hartree - fock calculation @xcite in the one dimensional model and our own in the 2d square lattice indicates the opposite .",
    "in fact , the hartree - fock approximation may fail anyway to describe correctly the order of the transition , as it is not appropriate to describe the gapless spin - wave excitations of the model in the ordered phase .",
    "contrary to the linear chain and the square lattice , the hartree - fock method however correctly predicts ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : hf ] ) a second order phase transition in the honeycomb lattice , at least for the parameter values studied here .    the magnetic mott insulator for @xmath67 has a charge gap , and is therefore fully described by the nonlinear sigma model , at least in more than one dimensions .",
    "this model does not present any further phase transition but the one at the critical coupling @xmath68 , which is thus related to @xmath5 .",
    "it is possible however that the charge transition to a band insulator might occur for @xmath4 values different from @xmath5 , as suggested by fabrizio _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "we shall return to this point below .      in a finite system with -say- @xmath69 sites",
    "a level crossing may occur for some particular boundary conditions , if allowed by symmetry .",
    "in particular , in the one dimensional model , it can be easily proved that there exists a finite value @xmath70 at which the ground state undergoes a change in the eigenvalue of the inversion symmetry operator @xmath71 .",
    "inversion symmetry around the site @xmath72 is defined by the following relations : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the electron vacuum state , by definition invariant under inversion symmetry .",
    "the additional relation ( [ inversion ] ) is necessary to completely define the inversion transformation @xmath75 in the whole hilbert space .",
    "inversion does not interchange the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 sublattice and clearly commutes with the hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) for any @xmath4 , provided the boundary conditions are real , namely periodic or antiperiodic ( see sec . [",
    "sec : manybody ] ) .    since @xmath76 , the identity , the inversion has obviously two eigenvalues , @xmath23 .",
    "we will show in the following that the ground state @xmath77 satisfies @xmath78 for @xmath52 , whereas for large @xmath4 there is a change of sign and @xmath79 , so that _ a level crossing must occur at an intermediate coupling _ @xmath80 .",
    "in the non - interacting system the ground state is a direct product of a spin up and a spin down slater determinants , both possessing the same orbitals of the lowest band .",
    "both slater determinants have a definite parity @xmath81 and the inversion eigenvalue of the global wavefunction is given by their product @xmath82 .",
    "hence the band insulating state is even under inversion .    in the large-@xmath4 mott insulator instead",
    "we can use the mapping to the heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ heis ] ) , whose ground state in arbitrary dimensions can be generally written as @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the spin lowering operator at the site @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the ferromagnetic state along the spin - up direction , and the wavefunction @xmath87 is real .",
    "@xmath87 is also subject to the well known ( `` marshall sign '' ) condition @xcite , i.e. the sign of the wavefunction is determined by the number of spin flips in the @xmath12 sublattice ( @xmath85 odd ) : @xmath88 the action of the inversion symmetry @xmath71 on the spin lowering operators can be easily found by applying the definition given in eqs.([inversion],[inversion1 ] ) , namely @xmath89 , and thus @xmath71 maps an element of the basis @xmath90 to another one @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 and can be determined using the canonical anticommutation rules to restore the order of the creation operators @xmath94 after the application of the inversion operator @xmath71 to the ferromagnetic state @xmath95 . since inversion symmetry does not change the marshall sign we arrive to the conclusion that the inversion eigenvalue of the heisenberg wavefunction coincides with the inversion eigenvalue of the ferromagnetic state @xmath95 which is simple to compute .    doing that we find that for @xmath96 , the inversion eigenvalue can change sign depending on the boundary conditions ( b.c . ) :",
    "@xmath97    this finally proves our initial statement ; in particular a level crossing from an even state to an odd one _ has _ to occur in a periodic ring with @xmath98 or in an antiperiodic one with @xmath99 .",
    "on the other hand , there will not necessarily be a level crossing in a periodic ring with @xmath99 and an antiperiodic one with @xmath98 . in summary , we conclude that the demise of the band insulator occurs via a symmetry change , whose finite - size signature is a parity switch from even to odd in the appropriate boundary conditions .      as will be discussed in sec.([sec : manybody ] ) the change of polarization in a many - body system can be obtained using a form of averaging over the boundary conditions .",
    "thus the averaging necessarily include both periodic ( pbc ) and antiperiodic ( apbc ) boundary conditions .",
    "now , in one or in the other , depending on l , a level crossing will necessarily occur at some finite @xmath70 .",
    "> from the theory of polarization a strong variation of the polarization can be expected as a function of @xmath4 around @xmath70 even in presence of a perturbations such as a dimerization @xmath100 ( see sec.([sec : manybody ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , within the hypothesis that there exists only a well defined mott transition at a critical value @xmath5 in the thermodynamic limit , we may expect that : @xmath101 that is , the @xmath4 value where the level crossing occurs for large size is just the critical value of the magnetic transition .",
    "understanding charge and spin excitation gaps is a crucial point .",
    "we have studied these quantities in the d=1 case as a function of @xmath102 , performing calculations on finite rings with pbc or apbc . by considering the sequence of closed shells with one electron per site",
    ", there is no level crossing and a finite size scaling analysis can be safely applied to the charge and spin gaps ( see the end of sec.[sec : model ] for their definitions ) . for a general finite size system ,",
    "the lowest order correction to any gap should be of the form @xmath103 .",
    "we have used a three parameter fit @xmath104 including also a higher order @xmath105 term , to improve the accuracy . in fig .",
    "( [ spinchargecl ] ) we show the finite size calculations of the gaps for the 6 and the 12 site ring , as well as the result extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit with the finite size scaling ( [ fit ] ) . in fig .",
    "( [ spinchargeop ] ) we also present the results for the spin and charge gaps for open shell rings of 6 and 12 sites .",
    "the overall behavior of the gaps for the largest open shell ring ( l=12 ) is in agreement with the infinite size extrapolation of the closed shell rings , supporting the validity of our finite size scaling . starting with the band insulator at small @xmath4 , and increasing @xmath4 , we find that both charge and spin gaps are very close , and decrease together until they appear to close at some @xmath5 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the charge gap turns sharply upwards , while the spin gap does nt . precisely at @xmath106 ,",
    "our fit suggests finite size gap corrections of the form @xmath107 , which implies not only spin , but also charge gapless excitations .",
    "this being the case , the system at @xmath5 is metallic .",
    "the nature of this metal is unknown and deserves further investigation.@xcite    > from our calculations it is hard to say whether charge and spin gaps will vanish at exactly the same @xmath5 , or at two slighly different values , as very recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "nonetheless it is suggestive that large finite size charge gaps and small spin gaps become slightly inverted after extrapolation , which goes precisely in the direction of a charge gap closing at a slightly smaller @xmath4 than the spin gap .",
    "we defer all discussion of the possible two - transition scenario to the work of fabrizio _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and we will not further dwell on it in this paper , where we consider for simplicity a single @xmath5 .      in the previous analysis of a level crossing in the model ( [ hubbard ] ) we did not explicitly use the exact bethe ansatz solution of 1d systems .",
    "in fact the result that the inversion symmetry @xmath71 for large @xmath4 has the same eigenvalue of the corresponding ferromagnetic state @xmath95 remains valid also in d=2 , an so does the evenness of the band insulator at small @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , unlike d=1 , the d=2 inversion symmetry , transforming @xmath108 leaves the ferromagnetic state invariant on a bipartite lattice .",
    "thus , a level crossing can not be argued based on identically the same symmetry argument . as it turns out , however , it is again possible to generalize the argument by using a more elaborate symmetry operator , which changes eigenvalue in going from the @xmath52 state to large @xmath4 state . in the square lattice",
    "this symmetry operator is easily identified .",
    "it is the mirror symmetry across the diagonal of the square lattice @xmath109 with @xmath110 odd ( see picture [ figsquare ] ) . in the honeycomb lattice",
    "one can also find a symmetry operation with the same property .",
    "however , it is much more involved and we will not discuss it in detail here .",
    "we only mention that this symmetry is obtained by a @xmath111 rotation around a site followed by an additional gauge transformation @xmath112 with suitable angles @xmath113.@xcite    based on this analysis , we can therefore conclude that , upon averaging over the boundary conditions , there will be , both in the square and in the honeycomb lattice , a level crossing when the system is in the mott state , but none in the band insulator state .",
    "therefore , we should expect a polarization anomaly , and a metallic state at the transition , also in these two dimensional cases .",
    "however , before moving on to do numerical work and check these expectations in these more difficult problems , it is wise to solve them in simple mean - field which , as the d=1 case demonstrated,@xcite is always very instructive .",
    "we shall consider the hubbard model on the bipartite honeycomb lattice , defined in sec .",
    "( [ sec : model ] ) , and on the simpler square lattice . in the latter case , in order to remove the nesting degeneracy of the non interacting 2d fermi surface",
    ", we have also studied the effect of the next - nearest neighbor hopping .    in the hartree -fock approximation the ground state of the hamiltonian",
    "is approximated by a slater determinant .",
    "we may further assume that this slater determinant @xmath114 is factored in spin space @xmath115 with this choice it is simple to obtain the hartree - fock hamiltonian by linearizing the interaction term : @xmath116 in this way we obtain : @xmath117 where @xmath118 where we have employed a fourier transform in the two sublattices and correspondingly we have defined the complex function : @xmath119 in the square lattice case the presence of the next - nearest hopping implies a further term : @xmath120 with @xmath121 to be added to @xmath122 in eq.([hfham ] ) . for a uniform solution in both sublattices",

    "all the bonding bands @xmath131 by minimizing the total energy we obtain two self consistent equations for the variational parameters @xmath132 : @xmath133 these equations can be easily solved by inserting a trial initial value for @xmath134 and @xmath135 in the rhs and iterating the result until selfconsistency is reached . for small u only a self consistent solution with @xmath136",
    "is possible , with a small charge transfer from the electron - rich site @xmath12 to the electron - poor site @xmath11 .",

    "however for @xmath148 we found a finite @xmath4 interval  between the band insulator at small @xmath4 and the mott - hubbard insulator at large @xmath4  where the bonding and the antibonding bands do overlap in a finite energy range , leading to a fully metallic behavior ( see fig.[hfgaptp ] ) . here",
    "the above analysys should be slightly modified to take into account the gain in energy obtained by occupying some states of the antibonding band .",

    "and although the hartree - fock approximation is by no means exact , it certainly represents a good starting point in dimension larger than one , so that we expect the tt model to have indeed an extended metal phase between the two insulators .    according to hartree - fock ,",
    "the two insulator phases are however still adjacent on the two sides of @xmath5 in the square lattice with first neighbor hopping ( t=0 ) , and in the honeycomb lattice , with any hopping .",
    "in the former , the nesting property of the non interacting fermi surface affects dramatically the hf solution , making it effectively one dimensional , and leading to an unphysical first order transition.@xcite moreover , even beyond hartree - fock , the first - neighbor square lattice model is not generic enough .",
    "an arbitrarily small next neighbor hopping will take it away to a tt , where the two insulators are most likely no longer adjacent .",
    "we conclude that , at least at the hf level , the simplest model which generically possesses a transition between a mott and a band insulator in 2d is the honeycomb lattice . here",
    "i ) the hf transition to a magnetic phase is second order ; ii ) there is no nesting of the non interacting fermi surface , which consists of just two k - points ; and iii ) the hf solution is always insulating ( band or mott ) as a function of @xmath4 with the excep[tion of a point where there is semimetallic behavior . for the above reasons , rather well justified at the hf level , in 2d we shall restrict our study to the honeycomb lattice case .    in the honeycomb hf solution , there is a small difference between the two critical values of @xmath4 , one where magnetism sets in , and the next where a band gap closes , fig .",
    "( [ hfgap ] ) .",
    "bearing in mind the discussion of sec .",
    "[ [ sec : chspgap ] ] , we can not judge whether this difference and its sign is just an artifact of the hf calculation or a real one . because of the crudeness of hartree fock , most likely the second .",
    "the evolution of the full hartree - fock band structure for increasing @xmath4 ( not shown ) is also instructive .",
    "the bands display a full gap both in the band insulator , and in the magnetic insulator .",
    "the presence of a spin gap in the latter is clearly an artifact due to breaking of spin rotation invariance characteristic of hartree - fock . at the upper critical @xmath4 ,",
    "where the charge gap closes , there is linear band dispersion , a point - like fermi surface , and a dirac massless spectrum centered at the 2d zone boundary .",
    "therefore we could expect a semimetallic state to exist at the treshold between the two different insulators .",
    "we argue that close to the point where the effective gap @xmath125 changes sign , the polarization will change dramatically as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "to verify our statement , we make use of the theory of the polarization , in the geometric phase formulation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the hartree - fock case , this amounts to calculate the contribution to the polarization of the spin - polarized band which becomes gapless at the critical point , when one effective gap parameter changes sign . in order to better illustrate that , we consider a model system consisting of spinless noninteracting fermions , described by the hamiltonian ( [ hfham])with a density of 1/2 fermion per site . with periodic boundary conditions",
    ", we can calculate analytically the change of polarization as we vary continuously the fermion energy gap @xmath1 , or alternatively as we introduce a small dimerizing distortion @xmath100 in the hopping . in the linear chain , without any distortion , @xmath149 , the variation of the polarization as a function of the energy difference @xmath1 between anions and cations is described by a step function : @xmath150 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "when we vary @xmath1 without changing its sign , the polarization does not change , while when the sign changes , the polarization jumps by @xmath151 as anticipated . we introduce a dimerizing distortion ( `` optical phonon - like '' ) @xmath100 which amounts to a change of the hopping @xmath152 for electrons hopping to the right and the left respectively of any @xmath12 site .",
    "we can evaluate analytically the `` born effective charge '' , which is the derivative of the polarization with respect to @xmath100 at @xmath153 0 : @xmath154 where @xmath155 , @xmath156 .",
    "@xmath157 and @xmath158 are complete elliptic functions of the first and second kind .    in this model , we have thus recovered the divergent effective charge anomaly discovered numerically in the 1d many - body calculation of resta and sorella @xcite .",
    "the same analysys holds for two dimensional or higher d - dimensional lattices provided that at the transition point @xmath159 the bonding and the antibonding bands touch at a @xmath160 dimensional ( fermi- ) surface , ( nesting ) . that is the case in particular for the @xmath3 square lattice but not for the honeycomb lattice .    in the honeycomb lattice , using the geometric phase technique for the mentioned spinless fermion model , it is straightforward to verify that without any distortion the polarization does not change as we vary @xmath1 . introducing a distortion along the @xmath161 direction : @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164 , @xmath165 @xmath166 , one can then verify that the component of the change in polarization which is orthogonal to @xmath161 vanishes , at least in first order in @xmath100 .    along @xmath161 , it is difficult to derive an analytic expression for the change in polarization .",
    "we can however extract the singular part of the effective charge , in the neighbourhood of the zero of @xmath1 @xmath167 the effective charge has therefore a finite symmetric jump when @xmath1 changes sign .",
    "since this is only the singular part , there will be in addition a smooth background contribution shifting this jump with respect to zero .",
    "( in d=1 , the singularity was infinite , so there the shift was irrelevant ) .    in conclusion",
    ", if the hartree - fock approximate picture were correct , we should expect such a polarization jump to emerge in the full many - body calculation for the 2d honeycomb lattice of the next section .",
    "as it will turn out , the jump is indeed verified , see fig .",
    "( [ z ] ) .",
    "moreover , the quantitative size of the jump is remarkably close to _ twice _ the value we have just obtained analytically .",
    "this result may be understood by assuming that each of the two bands with opposite spins , are forced to close together their single particle gaps , due to the spin rotation invariance of the model .",
    "this also suggests that the jump in the effective charge in 2d , similarly to the jump in the polarization in 1d , maybe due to topological reasons and therefore rather general and weakly dependent on the parameters defining the model .",
    "we now proceed to do proper polarization  or more precisely , effective charge calculation for a 2d interacting case .",
    "we restrict our study of the hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) to the honeycomb lattice ( a sort of 2d hexagonal bn ) , which is slightly more interesting because it does not possess inversion symmetry , and can have , _",
    "e.g. , _ a piezoelectric effect ( see sec.[sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the sites of the @xmath11 sublattice are given by @xmath168 , with @xmath169 , @xmath170 is the lattice constant and @xmath171 , @xmath172 .",
    "the lattice is space periodic under translations @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "the reciprocal lattice vectors are @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "the sites of the @xmath12 sublattice are given by : @xmath177 , @xmath178 where the three vectors @xmath19 which connect neighouring @xmath11 and @xmath12 sites are @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "obviously @xmath182 .",
    "we can also consider , for the purpose of mimicking a uniaxial stress along the @xmath161 direction : @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "the hamiltonian depends parametrically on @xmath100 , @xmath185 . in order to calculate the difference in the polarization of the system as the parameter",
    "is varied between its values 0 and @xmath100 , we consider families of hamiltonians @xmath186 obtained from ( [ hubbard ] ) by introducing a complex hopping and substituting @xmath187 @xmath188 , where the parameter k is given by @xmath189 , with @xmath190 , @xmath191 .",
    "this is equivalent to imposing generalised boundary conditions on the original hamiltonian @xcite : if @xmath192 is an eigenfunction of @xmath193 , then generalized boundary conditions imply @xmath194 , @xmath191 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions correspond to @xmath195 , antiperiodic to @xmath196 .",
    "the polarization difference between two states which are characterised by the initial and final value of the distortion , 0 and @xmath100 is given as an integral over the generalised boundary conditions : @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the unit cell volume , @xmath199 and @xmath200 take alternatively the values 1 or 2 , @xmath201 is the many - body generalisation of the geometric phase : @xmath202 and @xmath203 is the ground state of @xmath186 , which satisfies periodic boundary conditions .    in the numerical calculation",
    ", we adopt a cell with 8 lattice sites ( @xmath204 ) and 8 electrons .",
    "the number of spin - up and spin - down electrons is 4 , and the dimension of the hilbert space is only 4900 .",
    "the system is really very small , but we expect that averaging over the boundary conditions will reduce the finite size effects . in the calculation",
    "we are interested to study the behaviour of @xmath205 , the polarization difference between the undistorted ( @xmath206 ) and the distorted ( @xmath207 ) case , for different values of the onsite interaction @xmath4 .",
    "we use a discretized form to calculate the geometric phase numerically @xmath208 the geometric phase however is only defined modulo 2@xmath209 and an uncertainty in the result for the difference in polarization arises .",
    "there will be an ambiguity in the value of the polarization difference up to a quantum .",
    "however the polarization difference should remain unambiguous for neighboring values of @xmath100 .",
    "we can thus fix the 2@xmath209 uncertainty in @xmath210 by requiring that @xmath210 is continuous in @xmath100 for a given value of @xmath4 .",
    "we may also require that it is continuous for neighboring values of @xmath4 for fixed @xmath100 , so long as we do not cross a point of degeneracy in the electronic spectrum .",
    "+ convergence in the integration with respect to @xmath211 has not been easy and we had to use grids with 150 or 300 points to get reliable results . at the end",
    "we found that in the undistorted case , similarly to the one - dimensional case , there is a critical point @xmath212 , where the geometric phase changes discontinuously by @xmath209 for one @xmath211 in the 2d brillouin zone .",
    "as in one dimension this effect maybe related to the presence of a level crossing as a function of @xmath102 for a particular boundary condition .",
    "introducing next the dimerizing distortion , we found that the effective charge , as in the one - dimensional case , is positive in the region below @xmath212 and negative above . at @xmath212",
    "it is discontinuous , with a finite jump , instead of the one - dimensional divergence . a plot of the effective charge as a function of @xmath102 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ z ] ) .",
    "the transition between an ionic band insulator and a mott - hubbard insulator as exhibited by the prototype model ( eq.[hubbard ] ) is quite interesting .",
    "we have extended existing studies in d= 1 , probing deeper into the transition .",
    "we have also carried out newer investigations in d=2 , where same kind of transition is shown to take place , with some differences between the square and the honeycomb lattice .    with reference to the list of questions presented in the introduction",
    ", we can now formulate the following answers .",
    "the physical origin of the polarization anomaly is connected with the symmetry switch between an even state , typical of the band insulator , to an odd state , typical of the mott insulator .",
    "the symmetry switch , which we@xcite and others@xcite had noted earlier for finite size , is established here for arbitrary size .",
    "moreover , in d=1 , even and odd refer to simple inversion symmetry , in d=2 the pertinent symmetry operation is different and depends on the lattice .",
    "the threshold state between the ionic and the mott insulator , where the polarization abruptly changes sign , is one where the charge gap seems to close , and is therefore metallic .",
    "this result underlines the profound difference between the two types of insulator , and invites further studies , which are now beginning to appear@xcite of this transition .",
    "\\3 . in d=2",
    "the same model has again a band - to - mott insulator transition .",
    "the polarization anomaly is generally weaker , to a degree which depends on the lattice . in one dimension",
    "the effective charge diverges at the transition undergoing an abrupt sign change from @xmath213 to @xmath214 . in two dimensions this sign change persists .",
    "we have shown that in the 2d honeycomb lattice the divergence turns to a jump , again with a change of sign . here",
    "the magnitude of this jump is found to coincide almost exactly with @xmath215 , suggesting that this jump could be an experimentally detectable quantity dependent only on the bulk lattice constant and no other details of the actual material .",
    "the total piezoelectric coefficient @xmath216 might be used to detect the polarization anomaly , because it is sensitive to the sign of @xmath6 .",
    "it is conventionally divided into two contributions : the first , @xmath217 , is purely electronic , and is related to a uniform stress of the solid ( a simple scaling of all distances in the unit cell ) ; the second , more important contribution , is obtained by keeping the unit cell fixed and by changing the distance between atoms . in lattices without inversion symmetry , the piezoelectric coefficient @xmath216 is directly proportional , in magnitude _ and sign _ , to the effective charge @xmath6 , in the form ( we omit here for simplicity tensorial and vectorial indices ) @xcite @xmath218    where the constant @xmath219 represents the internal strain parameter .",
    "an anomaly in @xmath6 will clearly reflect in the piezoelectric coefficient .",
    "piezoelectric measurements could therefore permit the detection of a band - to - mott insulator transition , provided the system does not possess inversion .",
    "the honeycomb lattice which we have studied in d=2 is the simplest one that does not possess inversion symmetry .",
    "our study shows that the transition is not suppressed by piezoelectric strain .",
    "we have not been able to identify , at present , a likely compound where this kind of transition could be experimentally detected .",
    "it would seem possible , nevertheless , that suitable systems could be engineered , especially in the organic world .",
