    "the four of us , with w. paczek , e. richter - was , m. skrzypek and z. was  @xcite , have reported the entirely equivalent conservative theoretical precision tag @xmath7 for the bremsstrahlung correction for the general acceptance of the aleph sical detector .",
    "these results are currently being extended to the other new lep luminometers@xcite .",
    "it is clear that the precision tag on the theoretical prediction of @xmath8 , the slc / lep luminosity cross section , urgently needs further improvement over the @xmath7 level if the theoretical uncertainties are going to be reduced to the required level of one half of @xmath9 , the respective experimental uncertainty , so that they do not obscure the comparison between theory and experiment in the high precision @xmath10 physics tests of the standard model of the electroweak interaction .    from table 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite and from table 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we see that the subleading part of the @xmath2 pure bremsstrahlung correction to @xmath8 remains , at this writing , a dominant part of the outstanding theoretical uncertainty , where it contributes directly to the physical precision and indirectly to the technical precision both at a level @xmath6 itself .",

    "@xcite and @xcite and , in fact , the entire leading log part of the @xmath2 correction to @xmath8 has recently @xcite been incorporated into bhlumi4.0 . what remains to be done rigorously",
    "then is to compute the remaining exact subleading part of the bremsstrahlung correction to @xmath8 and incorporate it into our yfs monte carlo event generator bhlumi4.xx to check precisely the size of this effect in @xmath8 .    in this paper , we present the exact results which are necessary to evaluate this remaining unquantified sub - leading part of the bremsstrahlung correction to @xmath8 with particular emphasis on the acceptances of the new lep high precision luminometers .",

    "more precisely , the lone outstanding contribution from bremsstrahlung processes to @xmath8 which dominates the physical precision part of the error in bhlumi4.0 from @xmath2 bremsstrahlung is the sub - leading part of the virtual correction to the single bremsstrahlung process .",
    "thus , it is this latter process which we shall compute exactly in what follows in a fully differential manner , as is needed for monte carlo event generator applications .",

    "the appendices contain some technical details .",
    "in this section we set our kinematical notation and calculational conventions .",
    "we begin with the kinematics .",
    "the process under discussion is illustrated in fig .",

    "we consider the one - loop corrections to the process @xmath11 in the low angle regime of the slc / lep luminometers , where @xmath12 $ ] if @xmath13 are the cms scattering angles of @xmath14 , @xmath15 in the @xmath10 resonance energy regime .",
    "the kinematics is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : process ] .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that , in this low angle regime , graphs involving the exchange of more than one virtual photon line between different fermion lines are suppressed in the @xmath2 correction to the cross section .",
    "thus , we do not need to calculate these graphs for the @xmath2 corrections of interest to us here .",
    "further , it can be shown that those terms in the cross section involving interference of the radiation from the @xmath14 line with that from the @xmath15 line , in the low - angle bhabha scattering ( labh ) regime , are severely suppressed as well  this is the so - called up - down interference suppression @xcite .",
    "hence , we will only need to calculate the graphs , as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : process ] , where only one photon is exchanged between @xmath14 and @xmath15 lines and in which a virtual correction exists on one of these lines .",
    "there are a total of 36 such graphs , excluding vacuum polarization , and the ten electron - line emission graphs giving non - trivial results in our on - shell renormalization scheme are shown .",
    "the associated positron - line emission graphs must be calculated as well .",
    "the @xmath16-channel exchange graphs will also be calculated for completeness and we will see that they are indeed negligible at the level of accuracy of interest to us here .",
    "for the actual calculation , we rely on two technical tools .",
    "we evaluate the general @xmath17 emission amplitudes using the formulation of the calkul @xcite methods given by xu _",
    "thus , our massless fermion spinors @xmath18 , of helicity @xmath19 , are such that their spinor product is @xmath20 for @xmath21 in an obvious cartesian coordinate notation for the 3-momentum @xmath22  ( i.e. @xmath23 ) , and our corresponding photon polarization vectors are , for helicity @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the photon momentum and @xmath27 is an auxiliary massless 4-vector . as usual ,",
