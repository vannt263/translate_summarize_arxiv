    "the double - exchange ( de ) model is a minimal model which explicitly incorporates the interplay between itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is an annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath3 at site @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the transfer integral for nearest - neighbor sites @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are spin operators of itinerant electron and localized spin , respectively , which are coupled by the hunds - rule coupling @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the density operator , and @xmath11 is the chemical potential .",
    "the localized spins @xmath8 are treated as classical vectors .",
    "the model was originally introduced by zener @xcite , and has been studied for understanding the physics of perovskite manganese oxides @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the rediscovery of colossal magneto - resistance phenomena have stimulated extensive studies for the de systems , including some extensions of the model such as the super - exchange interaction between localized moments , orbital degeneracy of itinerant electrons , and electron - phonon couplings @xcite .",
    "the model ( [ eq : h ] ) is known to exhibit a ferromagnetic metallic state at low temperature ( @xmath12 ) to gain the kinetic energy of electrons by aligning localized moments in parallel .",
    "this is called the de mechanism @xcite .",
    "there have been many efforts to estimate the ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath13 @xcite . for the model on the three - dimensional cubic lattice ,",
    "@xmath13 was determined precisely by a large - scale monte carlo simulation : for example , @xmath14 at the electron density @xmath15 in the limit of @xmath16 @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we present our numerical results for the ferromagnetic transition when the model is defined on the geometrically frustrated lattice structure . among many frustrated lattice structures",
    ", we consider the pyrochlore lattice , which is a three - dimensional network of corner - sharing tetrahedra as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "one of the experimental motivations is found in a family of mo pyrochlore oxides _",
    "r_@xmath17mo@xmath18o@xmath19 : when the ionic size of rare earth element _ r _ is relatively large such as _ r _ = nd and sm , the compounds become ferromagnetic metal at low @xmath12 @xcite , and it was pointed out by the first principle calculations that the de mechanism plays a key role for this behavior @xcite . as a first step toward the understanding of thermodynamic properties of the pyrochlore systems , below we will investigate the ferromagnetic transition by monte carlo calculations for the simplest case , i.e. , the model ( [ eq : h ] ) in the limit of @xmath16 .",
    "we employ a monte carlo method to take account of large fluctuations in the frustrated system .",
    "the method is a standard one in which configurations of classical localized spins are sampled by monte carlo procedure ; the monte carlo weight is calculated by the exact diagonalization of the fermion hamiltonian matrix for a given spin configuration .",
    "the bottleneck of the calculations is the exact diagonalization , which usually limits the accessible system sizes to several hundreds sites .",
    "an improved method based on the polynomial expansion of the density of states was developed by the authors @xcite , but for frustrated systems , in general , the method becomes less efficient because of singular form of the density of states : indeed , in the present pyrochlore case , the density of states exhibits a @xmath20-functional peak due to two flat bands ( @xmath21 ) as well as two van - hove singularities ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) in the non - interacting model as shown in fig .  [ fig1](b ) .",
    "therefore we here employ the standard method .    to enable systematic analysis within the limited system sizes",
    ", we apply a technique of averaging over the twisted boundary conditions @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "a twisted boundary condition is imposed with replacing the transfer integral @xmath5 by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes a magnetic flux and @xmath26 represents the vector connecting the nearest - neighbor sites @xmath6 .",
    "the average is taken by the integral over @xmath27 , which is approximately calculated by the sum over @xmath28 grid points .",
    "it has been shown that the procedure reduces finite size effects originating from the discreteness of the wave numbers .",
    "it is shown for the model ( [ eq : h ] ) that in the limit of @xmath29 , the averaging procedure for a state of a finite size cluster with a given set of spin configurations provides results for the infinite size system which consists of a periodic array of the finite size cluster .",
    "for example , for the perfectly ordered ferromagnetic state , the averaging procedure with @xmath29 for any finite size cluster gives the exact result in the thermodynamic limit . in order to take this advantage",
    ", we apply the averaging procedure to each monte carlo snapshot for calculating the monte carlo weight .",
    "this corresponds to ensemble average over the independent systems with different boundary conditions . in the following calculations ,",
    "we take the average over the grid points with @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) . here , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a linear dimension of the system measured in the cubic unit cell , i.e. , the total number of sites @xmath36 .",
    "we demonstrate here the efficiency of the averaging technique by calculating the electron density @xmath37 as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "we show the monte carlo results at @xmath38 in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] as an example . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we present @xmath28 dependence for two different system sizes . in both cases ,",
    "the results converge onto a single curve as increasing @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , the necessary @xmath28 for the convergence becomes smaller as the system size @xmath39 increases .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows @xmath39 dependence with and without taking averages . in the case without taking averages , the results are largely scattered for different system sizes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "in contrast , as in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , when we take averages over a sufficient number of @xmath28 chosen for each system size , all the results converge onto a single curve and the finite size effects are sufficiently small , even for the rectangular - shaped clusters .",
    "we have checked the efficiency in wide parameter regions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 and confirmed that the averaging procedure is efficient enough to suppress the finite size effects coming from the discreteness of the wave numbers .",
    "we adopt @xmath28 used in fig .",

    "applying the method above , we investigate the magnetic behavior of the model ( [ eq : h ] ) in the limit of @xmath16 at the electron density @xmath15 .",

    "the electron density is fixed at @xmath15 by controlling @xmath11 . ]",
    "the value of @xmath13 is quite similar to that for the cubic lattice model , @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "this is reasonable because the de ferromagnetism is governed by the kinetic energy of electrons , and does not strongly depend on the details of the lattice structure .",
