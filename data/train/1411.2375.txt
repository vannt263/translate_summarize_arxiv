    "the potential success of novel spintronic nanoscopic devices relies on a complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms governing the transport of charge , spin and energy .",
    "in fact , the thermoelectric and thermomagnetic effects have been the subject of research in condensed matter physics for nearly two centuries .",
    "@xcite however , recently one observes a renaissance of interest in the phenomena based on the interplay of transport of charge , spin and energy , especially in nanoscopic systems .     in general , the thermoelectric phenomena in metals , such as the seebeck or peltier effects ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : background_thermoel ] ) , stem from the electron - hole asymmetry .",
    "@xcite whereas the consequences of this fact were well understood for bulk and continuous systems , the experiment of smith _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrating the thermoelectric effect in a tunnel junction ( formed by two metallic electrodes separated by an oxide barrier ) proved that this is valid in principle also for mesoscopic systems consisting of discrete subsystems  each of them being in local equilibrium , but not necessarily in equilibrium with other subsystems .",
    "the idea was further developed by johnson and silsbee ,  @xcite who suggested that if at least one of the electrodes is ferromagnetic and the junction is out of thermodynamic equilibrium , not only do thermally stimulated voltages and heat transport arise , but also electrically and thermally induced magnetization currents can appear .",
    "furthermore , they also predicted the reciprocal effects , i.e. ` magnetically ' stimulated electrical and thermal currents .",
    "independently , a theory of linear electrical and thermal transport between two metallic reservoirs interconnected _ via _ ideal leads to an arbitrary disordered system was developed by sivan and imry .",
    "@xcite    the interest in thermoelectric properties of nanoscopic systems , however , has been only awakened by first experiments involving quantum dots ,  @xcite which have been followed by numerous theoretical works covering the limits of both weak  @xcite and strong  @xcite tunnel coupling between the dot and electrodes .",
    "an important practical aspect accompanying research on thermoelectric effects is their potential significance for harnessing power dissipated as heat , and thus reducing the loss of energy .",
    "@xcite in this respect , a prospective candidate as heat - voltage converters seem to be single molecules .",
    "experiments on molecular junctions employing a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) setup and comprising up to a few molecules  @xcite have shown that such systems remain thermoelectrically responsive at temperatures as high as room temperature , and their specific thermoelectric properties can be to some extent tailored by chemical engineering .",
    "this , in turn , has also triggered a significant interest in theoretical description of thermoelectric transport through molecular junctions .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested that the efficiency of such devices can be improved due to a violation of the wiedemann - franz law occurring as a consequence of the system s energy quantization and coulomb interactions .",
    "@xcite    since electrons  apart from charge  possess also a spin degree of freedom , one should thus expect the interplay between spin and heat currents leading to some interesting thermoelectric phenomena .",
    "@xcite in general , these can be further distinguished into independent electron and collective effects .",
    "@xcite the former group comprises effects which can be explained by a model of two independent spin - channels , and thus it is limited to systems where the spin - flip diffusion length of conduction electrons is sufficiently long with respect to the system s length scale . on the other hand , in the case of the effects belonging to the second group , the spin currents are not simply only due to a particle current but they are also carried by magnon excitations .",
    "@xcite consequently , unlike the independent electron effects which are limited to metallic systems , the collective thermoelectric effects can arise not only in metallic ferromagnets ,  @xcite but also in semiconducting ferromagnets  @xcite or even in insulating magnets .",
    "@xcite    the spin - dependent thermoelectric effects , which are the subject of the present paper , have been experimentally studied in a variety of nanoscopic systems , such as magnetic tunnel junctions ,  @xcite nanopillars ,  @xcite nonlocal spin - valve devices ,  @xcite as well as multilayered  @xcite and granular  @xcite systems . moreover ,",
    "such effects have also been extensively studied theoretically in magnetic tunnel junctions ,  @xcite local  @xcite and nonlocal  @xcite spin valves , quantum dots ,  @xcite wires ,  @xcite wells ,  @xcite or even in single - molecule - magnet junctions .",
    "@xcite interestingly enough , it has been predicted , for example , that spin - polarized thermoelectric heat currents can reverse the magnetization direction of a ferromagnet ,  @xcite which appears due to the spin - transfer torque associated with purely thermal currents .",
    "this effect has been later confirmed by experiment .",
    "@xcite recently , a thermoelectric equivalent of spin accumulation , i.e. spin heat accumulation , manifested as different effective temperatures for the spin - up and spin - down electrons , has been observed in a nanopillar spin valve .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper we focus on spin - dependent thermoelectric effects that can arise in _ linear - response _ transport through a nanoscopic junction in which an impurity of spin @xmath0 is embedded into a barrier .",
    "unlike in the case considered by johnson and silsbee ,  @xcite spins of conduction electrons tunneling through the junction can be reversed owing to scattering on the impurity .",
    "such spin - flip scattering processes lead to exchange of angular momentum between the conduction electrons and the impurity , which in turn allows for the control of spatial orientation of the impurity s spin .",
    "@xcite    in the linear response regime and when no excitations are permitted , the spin exchange processes can result in transitions of the impurity only between degenerate spin states whose angular momentum differs by the quantum of angular momentum @xmath1 . for a _ spin - isotropic _ impurity , where all @xmath2 spin states are degenerate , this means that all these states can in principle contribute to transport .",
    "however , usually a spatial symmetry of a high - spin system is broken by the presence of environment , e.g. , as for a magnetic atom placed on a surface ,  @xcite which renders the system _ spin - anisotropic_. if only the _ uniaxial _ anisotropy exists , the two ground spin states are separated by an energy barrier . at sufficiently low temperatures , i.e. lower than the _ zero - field splitting _ energy between the ground and first excited doublets ",
    "being also the largest excitation energy between two consecutive states , the impurity occupies then only the ground state spin doublet , and no direct transitions are allowed between the doublet ground states . in consequence , in linear response regime only spin - conserving transport processes are possible .",
    "the situation changes when the _ transverse _ magnetic anisotropy is present in the system , as it allows for mixing of states with different @xmath3 numbers .",
    "in particular , for a half - integer spin one obtains a ground state kramers doublet , as follows from time - inversion symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we consider the situation when no energy excitations of the impurity are admitted .",
    "thus , when the impurity is _ anisotropic _ , the temperature is limited to the thermal energies smaller than the impurity excitation energy , and in particular the zero - field splitting energy .",
    "accordingly , only ground state doublet is involved in the linear - response regime . on the other hand , when the impurity is _ isotropic _ , then all impurity states are degenerate and all are involved in transport in the linear - response regime .",
    "thus , the above temperature restriction becomes irrelevant , similarly as in the case of a junction with no impurity . in sec .",
    "[ sec : background_thermoel ] we provide some background on thermoelectric phenomena .",
    "description of thermoelectricity in transport through a junction with spin - impurity in the barrier is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : transport_theory ] .",
    "numerical results and their discussion are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , which is followed by the section comprising final conclusions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "before introducing the model system to be considered in this paper and calculating the thermoelectric parameters of interest , we find it instructive to present some fundamental concepts regarding the conventional thermoelectricity ( for a more detailed discussion see , e.g. , refs .",
    "[ ] ) , and then their generalization to the corresponding spin thermoelectric phenomena . for this purpose ,",
    "let s consider a tunnel junction in which two metallic electrodes ( reservoirs of electrons ) are separated by a tunnel barrier .",
    "first , we consider the case when spin voltage is irrelevant ( conventional thermoelectricity ) , and then we also include the spin voltage ( spin thermoelectricity ) .      when a constant _ voltage _ @xmath4 and _ thermal _ @xmath5 bias is maintained across the junction , it results in a stationary net flow of charge and heat .",
    "@xcite moreover , since charge and energy are in fact both carried by electrons ( we do not consider here energy carried by phonons ) , the corresponding _ charge _",
    "@xmath6 and _ heat _ @xmath7 currents are related , leading to a variety of thermoelectric effects and relations .    in order to reveal relation between charge and heat transport ,",
    "let s first focus on the transport of electrons under isothermal conditions , @xmath8 .",
    "in such a case , the charge current @xmath6 is driven exclusively by a voltage bias @xmath4 , and the relevant transport coefficient is the well - known _ electrical conductance _",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 however , even though @xmath11 , there is a heat current associated with the electrical current , and this phenomenon is referred to as _ the peltier effect_. the relevant relation between heat @xmath7 and charge @xmath6 currents is then described by the _ peltier coefficient _",
    "@xmath12 ,    @xmath13    another limiting situation appears when the heat transfer through the system occurs due to thermal bias in the absence of a charge current , @xmath14 .",
    "the latter condition can be easily achieved when the system is in an electrically open circuit .",
    "the electronic contribution to the _ thermal conductance _",
    "@xmath15 is then defined as @xmath16 although the resultant flow of electrons is now equal to zero , a voltage difference between the two reservoirs appears as a result of thermal gradient .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the _ seebeck effect _ and is characterized by the _ thermopower _ ( _ seebeck coefficient _ ) @xmath17 , @xmath18 note that in order to achieve the condition @xmath19 in an electrically closed system , one needs to apply an external voltage compensating the charge current due to the temperature gradient .",
    "finally , the overall thermoelectric efficiency of a system is described by the so - called _ figure of merit _ , @xmath20 which is a dimensionless quantity expressed in terms of the experimentally measurable coefficients @xmath9 , @xmath15 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that @xmath15 in eq.([eq : zt_def ] ) generally includes also the thermal conductance due to phonons , which is not considered here .",
    "the concepts briefly described above can be further generalized to the transport model based on two nonequivalent spin channels .",
    "@xcite let s note first that charge transport in ferromagnetic conductors is generally associated with a spin current .",
    "second , the electrochemical potentials for spin - up and spin - down electrons can be different in the vicinity of an interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic materials ( i.e. up to distances of the order of the spin - flip diffusion length ) when the rate of electron scattering without spin flip is significantly larger than the spin - flip rate .",
    "this appears as spin accumulation at the interface .",
    "@xcite the spin accumulation ( spin - dependent electrochemical potentials ) , in turn , led to the concept of the so - called _ spin bias _ @xmath22 .",
    "accordingly , the difference in electrochemical potentials of the two electrodes in the spin-@xmath23 channel , @xmath24 , can be written as @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "thus , with the use of electrical and spin bias one can independently control electric and spin currents .",
    "moreover , in certain situations one can drive pure spin current , i.e. spin current which is not associated with any charge current . the occurrence of _ spin _ currents @xmath27 initiated the concept of _ spin _ counterparts of the thermoelectric effects discussed above .    under isothermal conditions both",
    "charge @xmath6 and spin @xmath27 currents can be controlled independently by voltage @xmath4 and spin bias @xmath22 .",
    "hence , one can define a generalized conductance matrix @xmath28 as  @xcite @xmath29         g_\\text{s}^\\text{m } & g_\\text{s}^ { }          \\end{pmatrix }          =          \\begin{pmatrix }          \\left (          \\dfrac{i_\\text{c}}{\\delta v }          \\right)_{\\!\\!\\begin{subarray}{l}\\delta t=0\\\\\\delta v_s=0\\end{subarray } }          &          \\left (           \\dfrac{i_\\text{c}}{\\delta v_\\text{s } }          \\right)_{\\!\\!\\begin{subarray}{l}\\delta t=0\\\\\\delta v=0\\end{subarray } }                      \\\\[6pt ]         \\left (          \\dfrac{i_\\text{s}}{\\delta v }          \\right)_{\\!\\!\\begin{subarray}{l}\\delta t=0\\\\\\delta v_s=0\\end{subarray } }          &          \\left (          \\dfrac{i_\\text{s}}{\\delta v_\\text{s } }          \\right)_{\\!\\!\\begin{subarray}{l}\\delta t=0\\\\\\delta v=0\\end{subarray } }          \\end{pmatrix }          .\\ ] ] furthermore , in addition to the conventional peltier coefficient @xmath12 , one can introduce a _ spin peltier coefficient _",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 the former coefficient describes a heat flow associated with an electrical current in the absence of spin voltage , whereas the latter one represents the heat current associated with a spin current for a zero voltage bias .",
    "note , the definition of the peltier coefficient @xmath12 is equivalent to that given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi_def ] ) providing spin accumulation is disregarded and there is no spin voltage .    the definition of thermal conductivity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa_def ] ) holds also in the present situation , when the additional constraint @xmath32 is imposed , @xmath33 interestingly , if spin accumulation can arise in the system , thermal bias can induce not only an electrical voltage @xmath4 , but also a spin voltage @xmath34 .",
    "the latter effect is referred to as the _ spin seebeck effect_. consequently , along with the conventional thermopower @xmath17 , one can formally define the _ spin thermopower _",
    "@xmath35 ,  @xcite @xmath36 to complete the discussion of spin - dependent effects , we note that a spin analog of the figure of merit @xmath37 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : zt_def ] ) , can be used to characterize the spin thermoelectric efficiency of a system , @xmath38 with @xmath39 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_s_def0 ] ) and the thermal conductivity  @xmath15 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa_s ] ) .    when a system is in an open circuit and there are no spin relaxation processes , then neither charge nor spin current can flow through the system .",
    "thus , one may alternatively define the thermoelectric coefficients for @xmath14 and @xmath40,@xcite i.e. @xmath41 for the charge and spin thermopowers , and also @xmath42 for the heat conductance .",
    "since to have zero spin current one needs to apply a spin voltage , the charge thermopower may be different from that determined from the conventional formula .",
    "note that this difference appears only when spin relaxation is slow . in the following",
    "we will use the definitions ( [ eq : s_s_def ] ) .",
    "the system to be considered in the following consists of two metallic  generally ferromagnetic ",
    "electrodes separated by an insulating barrier .",
    "tunneling of electrons between the electrodes can appear either due to applied voltage ( electric or spin one ) or due to a thermal bias , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) .",
    "experimentally , the system can be either a simple planar magnetic tunnel junction or a setup involving an stm tip as one of the electrodes .",
    "additionally , we assume that a magnetic impurity is embedded in the barrier between the electrodes ,  @xcite which scatters electrons traversing the barrier .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system @xmath43 thus consists of three terms , @xmath44 , representing the impurity , electrodes , and electron tunneling processes , respectively .    here",
    ", we focus mainly on magnetic impurities characterized by a large spin number @xmath21 , @xmath0 , whose behavior is dominated by the presence of magnetic anisotropy . in general , basic features of a large - spin magnetic impurity , represented by a spin operator @xmath45 , are captured by the _ giant - spin _",
    "hamiltonian ,  @xcite @xmath46 where the first and second terms denote the _ uniaxial _ and _ transverse _ magnetic anisotropy , respectively , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 standing for the corresponding anisotropy constants and @xmath49 . since we are interested here in magnetic impurities capable of information storage , we assume an energy barrier for spin reversal , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , also the transverse anisotropy constant can be assumed to be positive , @xmath51 , and the two magnetic anisotropy constants satisfy the condition@xcite @xmath52 .",
    "next , we assume a _ half - integer _ spin @xmath21 .",
    "due to the presence of transverse magnetic anisotropy , each of the @xmath2 eigenstates @xmath53 of the impurity hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham_s ] ) , @xmath54 , is then a linear combination of the eigenstates @xmath55 of the spin operator @xmath3 .",
    "note the notation we use for the eigenstates @xmath53 , with the subscript @xmath56 corresponding to the @xmath3 component of highest weight in the state @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath57",
    ". moreover , the eigenstates @xmath53 are twofold degenerate ( kramers doublets ) and form two uncoupled sets@xcite @xmath58 .",
    "thus , any eigenstate @xmath53 , for @xmath59 , can generally be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the overlap of the state with the eigenstate @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , the eigenstates constituting the ground state kramers doublet take the form @xmath62 from which one concludes that the system s spin can be trapped in one of two distinguishable spatial configurations with respect to the @xmath63th axis , referred to also as the system s _ easy axis_. the ground state would be split even in the absence of an external magnetic field , and as a symmetric admixture of states @xmath64 it would prefer orientation in the plane perpendicular to the system s easy axis . ] in the following , we will use the index @xmath56 only when necessary to avoid any confusion .",
    "electrodes are treated as reservoirs of itinerant and noninteracting electrons , and are described by the hamiltonian @xmath65 with @xmath66 denoting the conduction electron energy in the @xmath67th electrode ( @xmath68 for the left and @xmath69 for the right electrode , respectively ) , @xmath70 standing for a wave vector , and @xmath23 being the electron spin index .",
    "furthermore , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) is the relevant electron creation ( annihilation ) operator for the @xmath67th electrode .",
    "generally , both electrodes are characterized by a _",
    "spin - dependent _ density of states ( dos ) , @xmath73 .",
    "importantly , for the problem under discussion dos of at least one of the electrodes has to be energy - dependent and asymmetric around the fermi level in order to obtain a nonzero thermopower .",
    "the magnetic properties of the @xmath67th electrode will be described by the corresponding _ spin polarization coefficient _ , @xmath74 , defined at the system s fermi level @xmath75 as @xmath76 finally , electron tunneling processes between the electrodes are described by the appelbaum hamiltonian,@xcite @xmath77 in the equation above @xmath78 should be understood as @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) denote the pauli matrices .",
    "the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_t ] ) represents direct tunneling of electrons between the electrodes , while the second term takes into account the fact that during tunneling an electron can interact magnetically with the impurity either _ via _ exchange coupling or direct dipolar interactions ,  @xcite see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b)-(c ) .",
    "the former processes are then described by the tunneling parameter @xmath84 , whereas the latter ones by the exchange parameter @xmath85 , with both the parameters assumed to be real , isotropic , and independent of energy and electrodes spin polarization .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following parameterization for @xmath84 and @xmath85 : @xmath86 and @xmath87 , with @xmath88 being a dimensionless factor quantifying the coupling between the impurity s spin and the @xmath67th electrode , and @xmath89 .",
    "thus , @xmath90 becomes the key , experimentally relevant parameter,@xcite whereas @xmath91 establishes a relationship between the processes of direct electron tunneling and those during which the spin of a tunneling electron can be reversed .",
