    "in the last few years , it has become increasingly clear that supermassive black holes ( bh ) are an essential element in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the key observational evidence of a link between a bh and its host galaxy is provided by the tight correlations between bh mass and luminosity , mass , velocity dispersion and surface brightness profile of the host spheroids ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the link between bh and host galaxy is probably established by the feedback of the accreting bh on the host galaxy itself ( e.g.  @xcite , and references therein ) .    in order to fully understand the implications of bh growth on host galaxy evolution",
    "it is essential to measure bh masses in large samples of galaxies from zero to high redshifts .",
    "since direct bh mass measurements based on stellar and gas kinematics are possible only in the local universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) , less direct estimators have been calibrated following a `` bh mass ladder '' @xcite .",
    "the final rung of this ladder is provided by the virial estimators which allow us to estimate bh masses from the spectra of agn with broad emission lines ( type-1 ) : under the assumption that the broad line region ( blr ) is gravitationally bound and its motions virialized . the bh mass can be expressed as @xmath4 , where @xmath5  is the blr average distance from the bh , @xmath6 is the width of the broad emission line and @xmath7 is a scaling factor which depends on ( unknown ) blr properties . @xmath5",
    "can be estimated with the @xmath8 relation ( @xmath9 , @xcite ) leading to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is calibrated empirically starting from the @xmath0 relation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the basic assumptions of reverberation mapping is that the blr is photoionized @xcite implying that blr clouds are subject to radiation forces arising from ionizing photon momentum deposition . in a recent paper ( @xcite , hereafter m08 )",
    ", we showed that these radiation forces constitute an important physical effect which must be taken into account when computing virial bh masses .",
    "we empirically calibrated a radiation pressure correction of the form @xmath12 , and we showed that it is consistent with a simple physical model in which blr clouds are optically thick to ionizing radiation and have _ average _ column densities of @xmath13 towards the ionizing source .",
    "this value is remarkably similar to that adopted in standard photoionization models to explain observed blr spectra .",
    "recently , @xcite ( hereafter n09 ) proposed a test of the importance of radiation forces on virial bh mass estimates .",
    "he selected two large samples of type-2 and type-1 radio quiet agn drawn from the sdss survey , and covering the same range of redshift ( @xmath14 ) and continuum luminosity ( @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 ) . after eliminating type-2 galaxies classified as liners resulted in a final sample composed of 4197 and 1331 in the type-2 and type-1 objects respectively . by comparing the distributions of  line luminosities he concluded that the two samples were extracted from the same parent population .",
    "after the sample selection , n09 estimated bh masses for the type-2 sample using the @xmath0 relation in the calibration by @xcite .",
    "for the type-1 sample , he estimated bh masses using both the classical virial relation ( e.g.  @xcite ) and the one by m09 with the correction for radiation pressure .",
    "he then compared the distribution of bh masses and @xmath2 ratios finding significantly different distributions between type-2 and type-1 agn under the assumption that radiation pressure significantly affects blr motions .",
    "in particular , while the @xmath2 distribution of type-2 agn is broad , bell - shaped and extends up to @xmath19 , the @xmath2 distribution of type-1 agn with an important radiation pressure correction is strongly peaked at @xmath20 with a sharp cutoff at @xmath21 ( see fig .  3 of n09 ) .",
    "conversely , the distribution of type-1 agn without the radiation pressure correction is in good agreement with that of type-2 agn .",
    "n09 then concluded that radiation forces are not affecting blr motions , which is possible only if blr clouds have extremely large column densities ( @xmath22 ) .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the conclusions by n09 and we investigate the origin of the discrepancies amongst the @xmath2 distributions . the observed discrepancies",
    "do not imply that radiation forces are not important .",
    "they are expected from the physically - justified mathematical expression of radiation pressure corrected virial masses , if the intrinsic dispersion associated to such scaling relations is not taken into account . in particular , to obtain the  true ",
    "@xmath1  and @xmath2 distributions one should take into account the dispersion of the scaling parameters used in the virial estimators . we will not address the issue as to whether outflows affect blr motions ( e.g.  @xcite ) but we will assume that blr clouds are gravitationally bound .    in  [ sec :",
    "eddrat ] we discuss why truncated @xmath2 distributions are expected when using virial mass indicators with the correction for radiation pressure . in ",
    "[ sec : montecarlo ] we use montecarlo simulations to reproduce the results of n09 and we show that similar observed distributions are expected regardless of the importance of radiation pressure .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and draw our conclusions in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section we provide the physical explanation of the expected differences between `` observed '' and `` true '' distributions of @xmath1  and @xmath2 . for a given physical parameter ,",
    "we use `` true '' to denote its distribution of true values which is not actually observable because of measurement errors or uncertainties in adopted scaling relations .",
    "we use `` observed '' to denote the distribution of values obtained from the observations , by direct measurements or by applying scaling relations .",
    "the classical version of the virial theorem which does not take into account radiation pressure provides a mass estimator which can be written as @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath11 is a scaling factor which encodes blr geometry , physical structure and projection effects , @xmath24  is the fwhm ( _ full width at half maximum _ ) of the broad h@xmath25 line ( units of 1000@xmath26@xmath17@xmath18 ) , and @xmath27  is the continuum luminosity at 5100  ( @xmath28 , in units of @xmath29@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 ) . for consistency with n09 we adopt @xmath30 and slope @xmath31 .",
    "when taking into account radiation forces due to the absorption of ionizing photons , the virial mass estimator is modified as follows ( m08 ) : @xmath32 the second term represents the correction of radiation pressure and , in the assumption that blr clouds are optically thick to ionizing photons and neglecting other sources of radiation pressure , it is given by ( m08 ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34  is the agn luminosity in h - ionizing photons , @xmath35  is the total column density of blr clouds ( of both ionized and neutral gas ) towards the ionizing source , @xmath36  and @xmath37  are the bolometric corrections for the ionizing and optical continuum luminosities , respectively ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the empirical calibration performed by m08 , and adopted by n09 , assumed @xmath39 and provides @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; the latter value indicates an average blr column density @xmath42 , consistent with expectations from photoionization models .",
    "the column density of the blr clouds sets the relative importance of the gravitational force ( which depends on cloud mass ) and the radiative force ( which is independent of mass ) .",
    "therefore it is the most critical parameter for the radiation pressure correction and we can outline its effects by writing : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is @xmath35  in units of @xmath45@xmath46@xmath47 .",
    "the eddington ratios with and without radiation pressure correction are therefore : @xmath48^{-1}\\label{eq : edd}\\\\ { \\ensuremath{\\left(\\frac{{\\ensuremath{l_\\mathrm{bol}}}}{{\\ensuremath{l_\\mathrm{edd}}}}\\right)}}_\\mathrm{rad } & = & { \\ensuremath{b_\\mathrm{5100}}}\\left[{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{l}_\\mathrm{edd,\\odot}}}\\left(10^{\\ensuremath{{f_\\mathrm{rad}}}}\\ , { \\ensuremath{v_{h\\beta}}}^2\\ , { \\ensuremath{l_{5100}}}^{\\gamma-1 } + \\frac{10^g}{{\\ensuremath{n_{23}}}}\\right)\\right]^{-1}\\label{eq : eddrad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49  is the eddington luminosity for a 1 @xmath50  object .",
    "the observed distribution of eddington ratios in the pure virial case is determined by the observed distributions of @xmath24  and @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath24  and @xmath27  are log - normally distributed , then so are the eddington ratios .",
    "similarly , the observed distribution of eddington ratios with the radiation pressure correction is determined by the observed distributions of @xmath24  and @xmath27  but with an important additional feature which results from the addition of the radiation pressure correction .",
    "when the radiation pressure correction dominates over the virial term , @xmath51 , the eddington ratio becomes asymptotically constant @xmath52^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the critical luminosity at which radiation forces on blr clouds balance gravitation , and is a function of @xmath35  ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the physical meaning of this behaviour is straightforward : the virial mass estimator with the correction for the radiation pressure is valid only if the blr is gravitationally bound , that is if @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56(@xmath35 ) is always smaller than @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the maximum allowed eddington ratio and any @xmath2 distribution derived from eq .",
    "[ eq : mvircorr ] will be truncated at that value .    at first sight",
    "it might be assumed that the observed distributions of @xmath59 , obtained from eqs .",
    "[ eq : edd ] and [ eq : eddrad ] and depending only on the observed distributions of @xmath24  and @xmath27 , provide a good description of the `` true '' ones . however",
    "this proposition does not take into account the fact that the scaling parameters themselves ( @xmath11 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath37 ) are drawn from their own true   distribution functions and necessarily vary from one object to another . in order to properly represent the true   @xmath59 distribution this dispersion",
    "must be included , and the interpretation of the observed differences between true   and observed @xmath1  and @xmath59 distributions must be modified accordingly . since the scatter in the scaling parameters",
    "is not known and can not be taken into account , the observed @xmath59 distribution in the case of the radiation pressure correction will always present a sharp cutoff at @xmath63 .",
    "this cutoff is smeared away when taking into account the true   distribution of scaling parameters in general , and of blr column densities in particular .",
    "@xcite showed that the r.m.s .",
    "scatter of the @xmath0 relation using virial masses is @xmath64 dex , compared to the @xmath65 dex of the same relation using more direct bh mass measurements from spatially resolved stellar or gas kinematics .",
    "part of this additional scatter is probably explained by a broad distribution of @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) values , which is naturally expected since the physical properties of blr clouds must be characterized by a variance from one object to another ( e.g. , different cloud geometries and spatial distributions , relative orientations of the line of sights , etc . ) . recently ,",
    "fast eclipsing of the x - ray emitting source in the seyfert galaxy ngc 1365 has been unambiguously explained by occultation from fast moving blr clouds @xcite . in particular , these fast eclipses allow us to estimate the column density of blr clouds toward the agn , @xmath35 finding a distribution of values in the @xmath45-@xmath68@xmath46@xmath47  range . the existence of a relatively broad distribution of @xmath35  values in a single object might indicate an even broader distribution of values over the whole agn population .",
    "the @xmath2 distribution plotted in figure 3 of n09 clearly shows the features discussed above .",
    "in particular , the distribution obtained with the correction for radiation pressure is sharply cutoff at @xmath20 which corresponds to the critical value at which the blr becomes gravitationally unbound .",
    "conversely , the @xmath2 distributions for type-2 agn and type-1 agn with classical virial masses are bell - shaped , with a tail beyond @xmath20 .",
    "n09 interpreted these differences in the @xmath2 distributions as an indication that blr clouds have column densities significantly larger than @xmath69 , for which the radiation - pressure force term is negligible .",
    "however , a distribution of relatively small @xmath35  values ( @xmath70 ) with a tail extending to large values could in principle provide an alternative explanation of the existence of type-2 agn with @xmath2 beyond the critical value , without implying that radiation forces are not important in general .",
    "in this section we use montecarlo simulations to analyze the discrepancies observed by n09 and test the importance of radiation forces .",
    "we start from the observed distributions of continuum luminosity and broad line widths which , combined with assumed `` real '' distributions of bolometric correction and blr column densities , allow us to obtain the real distribution of bh mass values and eddington ratios .",
    "we consider two cases in which @xmath1  is obtained with or without important radiation pressure effect . by taking into account the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath0 relation",
    ", we then estimate the observed distribution of stellar velocity dispersion from @xmath1 .",
    "then we repeat the analysis by n09 and compare the `` observed '' distributions of bh mass and eddington ratios derived from the different scaling relations for @xmath1 .    for simplicity , we assume that the distributions of observed quantities and scaling parameters are lognormal . in particular , we assume that the observed distributions of @xmath27  and @xmath24  values can be expressed as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are normally distributed random numbers with zero average and unitary standard deviation .",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 are therefore the averages of the distributions of @xmath76 and @xmath77 values , while @xmath78 , @xmath79 are the standard deviations . after the selection of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 random numbers , we apply the sample selection criteria adopted by n09 ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "the agn are characterized by true   distributions of bolometric corrections and blr cloud column densities : @xmath82 with the same conventions as above .",
    "it is then possible to recover the true  distribution of bh masses from the @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 distributions .",
    "when radiation forces are important : @xmath87 with @xmath88 where @xmath89 represents the variance of the @xmath67 scaling factor and we have assumed , for simplicity , that the variance in @xmath61 is entirely dominated by the variance in the column density .",
    "conversely , in the case where radiation forces are not important , the true   distribution of bh masses is given by @xmath90 the observed distribution of stellar velocity dispersions is obtained , in both cases , from the @xmath0 relation : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is a normally distributed random number like @xmath72 .",
    "thus , it is possible to derive the `` observed '' bh masses and bolometric luminosities as : @xmath94 where @xmath95 or @xmath96 represent the virial estimators with or without correction for radiation pressure .",
    "these provide the observed distributions of @xmath2 and , clearly , these observational quantities do not include the true   distributions of scaling parameter values .     observed and true  distributions of bh masses ( top panels ) and eddington ratios ( bottom panels ) in the case of blr motions affected by radiation forces .",
    "the red line denotes bh masses derived from the @xmath0 relation ( @xmath97 ) , the black line denotes bh masses computed using classical virial relations ( @xmath96 ) and the blue line denotes bh masses computed using virial relations corrected for radiation pressure ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the shaded histograms indicate the true   distributions of bh masses and eddington ratios .",
    "the sharp cutoff in the observed @xmath2 distributions is present even if radiation pressure forces are important . ]     observed and true  distributions of bh masses ( top panels ) and eddington ratios ( bottom panels ) in the case of blr motions not affected by radiation forces .",

    "[ fig : dist1 ] . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist1 ] , we show the results for the case of blr motions affected by radiation forces .",
    "we use the following set of values : 5000 random realizations with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "this set of parameters was chosen to reproduce the @xmath97 and @xmath96 distributions observed by n09 but the actual adopted values do not influence our general conclusions .",
    "our simulated samples nicely reproduces the features of the @xmath95 and @xmath2 distributions observed by n09 : the distribution of bh masses computed with the radiation pressure correction is narrower than that based on @xmath0 and classical virial relations ; the observed distributions of @xmath2 ratios based on @xmath0 and classical virial relations are in nice agreement , while that based on radiation pressure corrected virial masses is sharply truncated at @xmath20 and more sharply peaked .",
    "the true   @xmath1  and @xmath2 distributions are intermediate between those found with and without the radiation pressure correction . for this simulation",
    "we have adopted @xmath103 dex but if we increase that value the true   @xmath1  and @xmath2 distributions will be broader and approaching those observed when using @xmath1  without the radiation pressure correction .",
    "allowing for an intrinsic dispersion in the scaling parameters , especially in @xmath35 , smears the cutoff in the observed @xmath2 distribution which then approaches the true   one .",
    "the comparison between the observed ( blue line ) and true   ( shaded histogram ) @xmath2 distributions shows that a fraction of sources have eddington ratios larger than the critical value at which a blr with @xmath42 becomes gravitationally unbound .",
    "this is possible only because , allowing for a distribution of @xmath35  values , a fraction of the sources have @xmath104 .",
    "then , if the true   distribution of eddington ratios extends to large values , blrs are gravitationally bound only if their average column density increases with @xmath2 ( see also @xcite ) .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist2 ] we show the results for the case of blr motions not affected by radiation forces .",
    "we use the same set of parameters as before , except for @xmath105 to have similar true  distributions of @xmath1  and @xmath2 .",
    "we observe again the same features that prompted n09 to consider radiation forces unimportant , and in particular the sharp cutoff in the observed @xmath2 distribution . in this case the true   distributions of @xmath1  and @xmath2 values are well matched by the observed ones , because the intrinsic scatter of the scaling parameters is small compared to the combined scatter of the observed line widths and continuum luminosities .",
    "the simulations presented in figs .  [ fig : dist1 ] , [ fig : dist2 ] indicate that , when taken at face value , the comparison of the observed @xmath106 and @xmath2 distributions would always lead to the conclusions that radiation forces are not important in determining the motions of blr clouds .",
    "however , we have shown that it is not possible to assess the importance of radiation forces on blr cloud motions on the basis of the _ observed _ @xmath1  and @xmath2 distributions .",
    "the differences between the @xmath2 distribution obtained using the @xmath0 relation and the one based on virial masses with radiation pressure correction can also be explained by neglecting the intrinsic dispersion in the adopted scaling parameters ( e.g.  @xmath60  and @xmath61 ) . in particular , the sharp cutoff at @xmath20 observed by n09 corresponds to the critical luminosity at which radiation forces balance gravitational attraction on blr clouds with the adopted @xmath35  value ( @xmath107 ) but does not indicate that radiation forces are negligible . a broad distribution of @xmath35  values ( e.g.  log - normal with @xmath69 average and @xmath108 dex standard deviation",
    ") will remove such sharp cutoff , fully explaining the observed differences in @xmath2 distributions .",
    "the sources with @xmath109 are then those in the high tail of the @xmath35  distribution .",
    "moreover , at these large @xmath2 , blr clouds can be gravitationally bound only if they have large column densities , e.g.  if @xmath35  increases with @xmath2 . in this scenario ,",
    "the sources with @xmath110 , for which radiation pressure is negligible , constitute a minority of the whole population . in conclusion",
    ", it is not possible to distinguish between the two scenarios in which radiation forces are negligible in all sources or in just a minority of them .",
    "when estimating bh masses using virial mass estimators , one should then always consider the possibility of important radiation forces by using the currently calibrated correction which corresponds to @xmath111 ( m08 ) , until it is possible to assess the possible dependence of @xmath35  on the observed source properties .",
    "finally , the comparison of the @xmath1  and @xmath2 distributions proposed by n09 can still constrain the overall scatter in the scaling parameters used in virial mass estimators . a detailed analysis of this issue",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper but , briefly , after obtaining the true   distributions of @xmath1  and @xmath2 from the observed distribution of stellar velocity dispersions one can match it with the @xmath1  and @xmath2 distributions based on virial masses , convolved with a suitable broadening function .",
    "such a broadening function would then provide the combined variance of blr physical properties in the sample of agn under examination ."
