    "in recent decades , integrable models in one - dimensional strongly correlated electron systems have attracted considerable attention in relation to high-@xmath1 superconductivity . in general ,",
    "integrable models are solvable by means of the bethe ansatz .",
    "the critical exponents of the correlation functions depend only on the @xmath2-matrix of the underlying infinite dimensional symmetry and the geometry of the fermi sea of the ground state ( see the book  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this important fact shows that all integrable models with a given @xmath2-matrix exhibit the same universal critical behavior . on the other hand ( 1 + 1)-dimensional critical phenomena",
    "are connected with conformal field theory ( cft )  @xcite .",
    "the central charge and conformal dimensions are calculated by the scaling behavior of the ground state and the low - lying excitations  @xcite .",
    "the conformal dimensions determine the long distance asymptotics of all correlation functions of any local operators . for integrable models ,",
    "one obtains the conformal dimensions by use of the bethe ansatz in terms of the so called dressed charge function satisfying a linear integral equation .",
    "thus the bethe ansatz together with cft provide a powerful tool to study the correlation functions especially at the critical point @xmath3  @xcite . for finite temperatures",
    "however , one encounters technical difficulties . despite the fact that the models are still solvable even off criticality",
    ", the above powerful methods lose effect due to the collapse of conformal invariance .",
    "qualitatively , we see the long - distance behavior of the correlation functions show exponential decay and calculate the low temperature asymptotics by extension of the conformal mapping ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "however we need another approach for the _ quantitative _ understanding of the correlation functions at finite temperatures . as a totally different approach",
    ", the quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) has been proposed recently to overcome such difficulties  @xcite .",
    "originally the qtm method has been developed as an alternative method to the traditional thermodynamical studies  @xcite . utilizing the trotter mapping , one deals with a two - dimensional classical system instead of the original one - dimensional quantum system . using the underlying integrability ,",
    "one constructs a family of _ commuting _",
    "qtms  @xcite .",
    "the commuting qtms are diagonalized by means of the bethe ansatz .",
    "thermodynamical quantities are expressed in terms of the sole largest eigenvalue .",
    "also , this procedure has remarkable advantages for the studies of correlation functions , which is the main topic of our paper .",
    "explicitly , the correlation lengths can be calculated by taking ratios of the largest eigenvalue and the sub - leading ones  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study a strongly correlated electron system using the approach sketched above . as a result",
    ", we evaluate the six crucial correlation lengths for arbitrary particle densities and finite temperatures : ( i ) the longitudinal and ( ii ) transversal spin - spin correlations , ( iii ) the density - density correlations , ( iv ) the one - particle green function , ( v ) the singlet and ( vi ) triplet superconducting pair correlations .",
    "these are the first quantitative calculations for correlation functions of strongly correlated electron systems off criticality .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model  @xcite on a periodic lattice of size @xmath4 is defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) denotes the fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator at @xmath8th site satisfying the canonical aniticommutation relations @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the number operator , i.e. @xmath11 . the ground state properties and the long - distance behavior of the correlation functions have been studied in  @xcite by the bethe ansatz and cft . due to the massive spin excitations ( @xmath12 )",
    ", the ground state properties are described by a one - component tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( luther - emery liquid ) . for this system",
    "the one - particle green function decays exponentially fast , the density - density and certain pair correlations are quasi - longranged with algebraic decay .",
    "as the model is one - dimensional it does not exhibit off - diagonal long - range order .",
    "however , the crossover behavior from dominant density - density correlations to dominant ( singlet ) pair correlations driven by the density of particles manifests superconducting properties .",
    "more quantitatively , on the basis of scaling arguments and rg concepts we would expect that higher dimensional interactions such as interchain couplings are relevant and may lead to true condensation of cooper pairs .",
    "the model is related to a trigonometric @xmath2-matrix which is a solution to the graded ybe  @xcite associated with the four - dimensional irreducible representation of the quantum superalgebra @xmath0  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for the rational case @xmath13 ) .",
    "the diagonalization of the hamiltonian for general @xmath14 and @xmath15 was done in  @xcite and the diagonalization of the associated row - to - row transfer matrix was done for the rational case @xmath13 in  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics have been investigated by the traditional thermodynamic bethe ansatz based on the string hypothesis in  @xcite and the present approach in  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of correlation functions of this model have been studied so far only for the ground state where a crossover was established from a normal to a `` superconducting '' regime driven by the particle density .",
    "here we want to extend this study to finite temperatures where we are especially interested in the extension of the `` superconducting regime '' in the density - temperature phase diagram . for this purpose",
    "we define the qtm acting on a @xmath16-graded vector space . as a consequence",
    ", the genuine fermionic statistics are built into the qtm algebraically through the grassmann parity @xmath17 $ ] ( see eq .  ) .",
    "regarding the thermodynamical quantities , one might content oneself with the corresponding null grassmann parity model we obtain the null - parity model satisfying the ordinary yang - baxter equation by multiplying the original graded @xmath2-matrix by suitable minus signs .",
    ", because the fermionic statistics does not affect the thermodynamical quantities directly . however , one must be careful to keep track of the fermionic statistics when considering the physical quantities changing the particle number .",
    "as the auxiliary and quantum space are the same graded vector space , we easily obtain the eigenvalues of the qtm by using the results from the algebraic bethe ansatz for the row - to - row transfer matrix .",
    "the resultant eigenvalues can be expressed in the dressed vacuum form ( dvf ) via the bethe ansatz equation ( bae ) .",
    "the difference between the dvf of the qtm and the one of the row - to - row transfer matrix consists only of their vacuum parts .",
    "hence , in the actual calculation to the dvf , one utilizes the methods developed in the finite - size correction problem @xcite . in consequence , all information of the bae is contained in three non - linear integral equations ( nlies ) , which are valid for a system with any trotter number @xmath18 . in this approach",
    ", the limit @xmath19 can be taken _",
    "analytically_. this finite set of nlies allows for highly accurate numerical calculations of physical quantities such as the above mentioned correlation lengths .",
    "in particular , we observe temperature dependent crossover phenomena between regimes dominated by density - density or ( singlet ) superconducting pair correlations , respectively . at low temperatures ,",
    "the three nlies are reduced to only one _ linear _ integral equation , which reflects the one - component tomonaga - luttinger ( luther - emery ) liquid properties .",
    "this linear equation is evaluated analytically and reproduces the predictions from cft .",
    "the formulations in this paper are applicable to various kinds of strongly correlated electron systems which have superalgebra invariance , for example the supersymmetric extended hubbard model ( @xmath20-invariance )  @xcite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we define the commuting qtm constructed by the graded @xmath2-matrix .",
    "the qtm is diagonalized by the algebraic bethe ansatz in analogy to the ordinary row - to - row transfer matrix . in section  3",
    "we study the eigenvalues by introducing certain auxiliary functions .",
    "investigating their analyticity , we determine the nlie for the largest and sub - leading eigenvalues .",
    "we obtain six sets of nlies characterizing the above mentioned correlations .",
    "the numerical results for these nlie are discussed .",
    "section  4 is devoted to the analytical calculation of the low temperature asymptotics of the correlations characterized by gapless excitations .",
    "section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "details of technical calculations are summarized in various appendices .",
    "the model   is solvable under the conditions @xmath21 here the physical region of the two parameters @xmath22 and @xmath15 is restricted to @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( repulsive ) or @xmath25 ( attractive ) .",
    "[ this does not include the pure hubbard model which corresponds to @xmath26 and @xmath27 violating .",
    "note however , that a unified treatment of the @xmath0-invariant generalized hubbard model and the standard hubbard model might be possible on the basis of the work in @xcite . ] several prominent models are comprised as special cases : the supersymmetric @xmath28 model ( @xmath29 ) , the pure correlated - hopping model ( @xmath30 ) and a model of hard core particles of three species ( doubly occupied site , single electron with spin pointing either up or down ) ( @xmath31 ) . for any finite @xmath15 the spinon excitations have a mass gap and so do single particle excitations .",
    "the pair excitations ( singlet ) and the particle - hole type excitations are massless .",
