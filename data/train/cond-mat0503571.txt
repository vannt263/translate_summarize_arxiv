    "a mean - field approximation resulted in the usual criticality , while the inclusion of correlation effects ( in the mean - spherical approximation ) yielded the second transition .",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible to draw a clear conclusion because for three - dimensional lattices the same approach gives the second transition even for the bulk fluid .",
    "a similar dilemma resulted from the theoretical approximations has been reported@xcite for an off - lattice model studied within the ornstein - zernike approach .",
    "recent rigorous results for lgqi model on a bethe lattice@xcite did not give any evidence for the second transition ( at least in the range of parameters the authors have studied ) .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath101 , we can recover the results of ref .",
    "it can be readily checked that the pressure given in eq .",
    "( [ pressure1 ] ) and the density given in eq .",
    "( [ coverage2 ] ) satisfy gibbs - duhem equation , eq .",
    "( [ gibbsduhem ] ) .    from eq .",
    "( [ coverage2 ] ) , we can see why the critical temperature for a confined fluid is lower than in the bulk .",
    "the main reason is that the effective fluid - fluid interaction inside the matrix is weaker because of the decreasing fluid coordination number @xmath102 .",
    "( [ coverage2 ] ) has quite the same structure as eq .",
    "( [ coverage ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can anticipate that the results to be obtained with the model considered in this subsection will be very similar to those in the previous subsection .",
    "it is expected that there exist a region in the parameter space of @xmath103 s ( local number of matrix neighbors ) , @xmath104 s ( concentrations ) and @xmath12 ( fluid - matrix interaction ) in which the double criticality appears . to confirm this",
    ", we carried out numerical calculations again for a bimodal case with two coordinations @xmath105 and @xmath106 , such that the average number of matrix neighbors is , @xmath107 then , eq .  ( [ coverage2 ] ) gives a typical bimodal result with two sublattices .",
    "as in the previous subsection , we can see either one or two phase transitions depending on the specific values of @xmath41 and @xmath55 . the spinodal curve with the double criticality is presented in figure  3 which shows all the characteristic features we have seen already ( lowered @xmath53 s and narrowed coexistence gap ) .",
    "the spinodal curve is again symmetrical with respect to @xmath75 when the sign of the fluid - matrix interaction , @xmath12 , is changed .",
    "however , this does not change the critical temperature ( for both transitions ) . recall that the positive @xmath12 describes a repulsive fluid - matrix interaction . in this case , it is difficult to associate one of the two phase transitions with the wetting phenomenon",
    ".    no double criticality has been found from the rigorous results @xcite for this model on a bethe lattice .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that the effective field distribution found by the authors of @xcite is multimodal and temperature - dependent ( see figures 3,4 in @xcite ) .",
    "the distinction between the main peaks becomes less clear - cut with increasing temperature and site dilution .",
    "we may suppose that the range of parameters explored was out of the threshold , necessary for observing the double criticality .",
    "another important point is that the authors of @xcite have studied the case of fixed field , @xmath108 , which is not the case for our study here .",
    "such a constraint fixes a given thermodynamic path ( pressure , temperature ) along which the state of the fluid is varied . as a result ,",
    "their field distribution changes its degree of asymmetry with the temperature .",
    "it is known that the degree of asymmetry is crucial in observing the double criticality in the rfim language @xcite .    in this subsection , we studied a model which takes into account the presence of matrix particles .",
    "the explicit description of matrix particles introduces two key ingredients which play an important role in the fluid phase behavior , _",
    "i.e. _ , the local fluid coordination and the fluid - matrix interaction .",
    "it is remarkable that the mean - field result of this model is very similar to that obtained in the previous subsection for a model which only embodies the spatial heterogeneity .",
    "so , it is tempting and also looks plausible to consider the space heterogeneity as the key prerequisite of the double criticality .",
    "the real appearance of the double criticality is determined by the strength of the heterogeneity which is described by @xmath109 for both models considered above .",
    "although the numerical values of @xmath109 differs for the two models , the main physics is not altered at all .",
    "the space heterogeneity can have different origins .",
    "for the model considered in this subsection , the double criticality is related to the coexistence of two polymorph liquid phases with different coordination numbers .",
    "this polymorphism is induced by the heterogeneity in the number of matrix nearest neighbors .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that a bimodal matrix distribution may lead either to one or to two critical points .",
    "now , a subtle question one may ask is whether it is possible to observe two phase transitions when the matrix distribution is apparently unimodal ? before answering this question , it is useful to discuss how the pore size distribution is usually determined . even for rigid matrices ,",
    "such a determination is not a straightforward task . for the models frequently used in computer simulations ( _ e.g. _ , matrix of hard spheres )",
    ", the distribution of matrix particles is not related directly to a pore size distribution .",
    "the latter is usually determined through the tessellation@xcite of the void space .",
    "it is to be noted that such tessellation methods do not allow for identifying closed cavities .",
    "the closed pores are inaccessible to the fluid in real experiments or in simulations which mimic the real fluid adsorption . in these cases ,",
    "the matrix distribution seen by the fluid is different from that determined without excluding the closed pores .",
    "recent studies @xcite have demonstrated the importance of the pore blocking and connectivity effects .    in order to analyze the role of closed cavities",
    ", one can assume that the nominal pore size distribution @xmath110 ( _ i.e. _ , that including the contribution of closed pores ) is gaussian with the mean pore size @xmath111 and dispersion @xmath112 .",
    "guassian distributions were indeed found with the tessellation method for the matrix samples used in simulations@xcite .",
    "since the closed pores are generated in the same way as the open ones , it can be reasonably expected that the distribution of the closed pores , @xmath113 , is similar to the nominal one but characterized by @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "if the fluid accessible pores and the closed cavities are uncorrelated , then a non - normalized distribution of fluid accessible pores @xmath116 is given by the product of the nominal distribution and the probability of finding an open pore ( @xmath117 $ ] ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath118.\\ ] ] even when @xmath110 and @xmath113 are unimodal distributions , @xmath116 could be bimodal .",
    "such a situation is shown in figure  4 .",
    "one can see that the effective pore size distribution , @xmath116 , becomes bimodal when there is a significant overlap between the peak of @xmath110 and that of @xmath113 . just as the appropriate combination of @xmath55 and @xmath41 leads to the double criticality , the appropriate combination of @xmath114,@xmath111 , @xmath115 and @xmath112 results in an effective bimodal pore size distribution which can lead to the double criticality .",
    "this might be considered as one of possible explanations of the puzzling results found in the computer simulation @xcite .    from a more general point of view , the pore size distribution can also depend on the fluid state because of the pore blocking effects@xcite or due to the matrix reaction to the fluid adsorption .",
    "this is evident for real world experiments with adsorption in high - porosity materials like aerogels@xcite . upon adsorption ,",
    "such matrices can contract or expand in volume and thus change their pore size distribution .",
    "this effect is not exclusive to relatively soft gel - like matrices but also quite common for various intercalation compounds@xcite .",
    "in fact , the distribution of the pore space effectively seen by a fluid depends on both the matrix preparation and the fluid state . in our language , this is equivalent to say that the distribution is conditional , @xmath119 , which is conditioned by the fluid state characterized here by the fluid density , @xmath27 . for simplicity , we consider explicitly the binding energy distribution but all the conclusions can be easily translated into the porosity language .",
    "as we have seen in the previous sections , the average fluid density can be obtained from that for a particular disorder realization , @xmath120 , through the following relation , @xmath121 now the compressibility becomes @xmath122.\\ ] ] here , the first term is an average over disorder and the second term takes into account the matrix reaction _",
    "i.e. _ , the modification of the matrix distribution induced by adsorbates .",
    "( [ compress ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath123^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath124 in the case of a unimodal @xmath125 ( no double criticality ) , a divergent @xmath126 ( at some density @xmath127 ) corresponds to a phase transition resulting mainly from the intrinsic fluid properties .",
    "the matrix only rescales the critical parameters and the behavior of the confined fluid is somehow bulk - like .",
    "but , under the condition @xmath128 @xmath129 is again singular ( at another fluid density @xmath130 ) .",
    "we observe under this condition a second transition .",
    "this effect is quite similar to the polymorphism in simple fluids with density - dependent pair potentials@xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the matrix reaction , we can see the criticality even if the bulk - like behavior is not critical ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath126 being finite ) .",
    "this offers a possibility for creating a critical state under conditions , different from the bulk critical point",
    ". this possibility might find interesting technological applications .",
    "we would like to emphasize that in fact the pore size distributions measured experimentally are the conditional ones . from the usual techniques ,",
    "the pore size distribution is often deduced by fitting adsorption isotherms@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the results of such measurements depend on the fluid state and on the used probe molecules . from the theoretical point of view , such a distribution naturally appears when the maximum entropy approach @xcite is applied to the determination of the relevant distribution ( for @xmath131 in the case considered here ) from some indirect data @xmath132 ( the over - bar denotes the average over disorder ) .    in this section",
    ", we described a scenario in which a nominal unimodal matrix distribution , found through analyzing the matrix geometry , can behave as an effectively bimodal if the accessibility of the pores to the fluid is taken into account .",
    "alternatively , one can observe the double criticality even for a unimodal distribution , provided that it is sensitive to the fluid thermodynamic state . in this case",
    ", one critical point corresponds to a rescaled bulk - like transition , while the other transition is related to the matrix reaction to the presence of adsobates .",
    "the main question studied in the present work is how the heterogeneity of a hosting system is related to the occurrence of two critical points for a fluid adsorbed in it . for answering this question",
    ", we analyzed in details the role of several relevant factors .",
    "our analysis is based on an analytically tractable lattice model with a bimodal distribution of binding energies or local porosities .",
    "we find that the the bimodality itself does not guarantee the existence of two critical points .",
    "the adsorbed fluid can undergo two phase transitions only when the host heterogeneity is sufficiently strong .",
    "for the models considered here , this is manifested through the existence of a threshold , @xmath109 , for the appearance of the double criticality . for two samples having ( due to the preparation ) the same mean binding energy @xmath133 or mean porosity @xmath134/q$ ] , one can observe either one or two critical points depending on the particular values taken by @xmath41 and @xmath55 .",
    "this provides the criterion for predicting the occurrence of the double criticality for the lattice models considered here .",
    "nevertheless , it does not seem to be straightforward to translate the criterion obtained here to the case of off - lattice models .    within the framework of the models studied here , the two phase transitions correspond to the condensation in the regions of different binding energy or local porosity . in the latter case ,",
    "the nature of the double criticality is related to the coexistence of two polymorph liquid phases with different coordination numbers .",
    "this polymorphism is induced by the heterogeneity in the number of matrix nearest neighbors .",
    "the reduced fluid coordination number ( compared to the bulk ) leads to the well - known effects : lowering of @xmath53 and shrinking of the coexistence density gap .",
    "we argue that in order to give an appropriate analysis of simulation results in terms of a pore size distribution function , one should be aware that the matrix distribution seen effectively by the adsorbed fluid can depend on many factors , _",
    "e.g. _ , presence of closed pores , non rigidity of the matrix etc .. a nominal unimodal matrix distribution , found through analyzing the matrix geometry , can behave as a bimodal in the presence of a fluid if closed pores exist .",
    "this could be a possible explanation of recent puzzling simulation results@xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can observe the double criticality even in the case of an unimodal distribution , provided that it is sensitive to the fluid thermodynamic state . in this scenario",
    ", one critical point corresponds to a rescaled bulk - like transition , while the other transition is induced by the matrix reaction to the presence of the fluid .",
    "this double criticality mechanism is quite similar to the polymorphism in fluids with density - dependent interactions@xcite .",
    "finally , we can wonder also why no more than two phase transitions have been observed from simulations up to now . in principle , we can observe three critical points with the models studied here when a trimodal distribution is considered with @xmath135 and @xmath136 . in the light of the results obtained in this work , we expect to observe three phase transitions only under the conditions that @xmath137 and @xmath138 are different enough . the same argument applies to the matrix coordination differences .",
    "but in this case , the above conditions can not be fulfilled easily because neither @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) nor @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) can exceed the maximal number of nearest matrix neighbors , @xmath1 , which is restricted by the dimensionality of space and by steric effects .",
    "this makes the region of three phase transitions very narrow ( even if it exists in the parameter phase diagram ) .",
    "this is probably why till now only two phase transitions were found .",

    "<S> the phase transition of a fluid adsorbed in a heterogeneous system is studied with two simple lattice gas models within the framework of a mean - field theory . despite the different origin of the heterogeneity ( spatial variation of binding energy or fluid coordination numbers ) , </S>",
    "<S> the fluid can undergo two phase transitions if the hosting system is sufficiently heterogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly shown that such a polymorphism in the confined fluid results from the successive condensations in distinct spatial regions of the host . we have found the precise conditions at which one two phase transitions occur . </S>",
    "<S> the insight gained from the present study allows one to understand better some recent puzzling simulation results . </S>"
