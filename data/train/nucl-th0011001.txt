    "<S> within the framework of an isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics model , the rotational flow in reactions of @xmath0fe + @xmath0fe and @xmath0ni + @xmath0ni at 40 mev / nucleon for different impact parameters is investigated by analyzing the mid - rapidity azimuthal distribution . </S>",

    "<S> the azimuthal distribution in heavy ion collisions ( hic s ) has proved very useful in the study of nuclear equation of state ( eos ) as well as reaction dynamics because of its sensitivity to collective flow@xcite . in particular , the rotational flow may still exist even though the directed flow has disappeared@xcite . with the recent advance in radioactive nuclear beam physics , one can investigate isospin degrees of freedom in nuclear reactions at wide energy ranges for different projectile - target combinations@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> 1 that for low ( target - like ) rapidity region the azimuthal distribution only peaks at @xmath19 while it only peaks at @xmath24 for high ( projectile - like ) rapidity region , which imply that these reaction systems display negative deflections ( corresponding to negative scattering angles ) since the incident energy is below the balance energy@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> , one can see that the rotational flow increases with increment of impact parameter @xmath26 from near central to peripheral collisions and then decreases , and finally disappears in the most peripheral collisions since at such large impact parameter the interaction between the projectile and target is very weak .    in order to see more clearly the rotational flow and its isospin dependence , one can calculate some characteristic physical quantities of the rotation for mid - rapidity nucleons , such as the angular momentum , the moment of inertia , the angular velocity and its rotational energy , with the help of classical mechanics . in the present iqmd model calculations , </S>",
    "<S> we simply consider the nucleon system as a rigid body at every time point and then the angular momentum about the normal of the reaction plane ( @xmath27-axis ) can be calculated as follows ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are components on the reaction plane of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the c.m . system . </S>",

    "<S> the values for @xmath0ni + @xmath0ni have been offset with 2 fm/@xmath44 in the horizontal direction for clarity . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are negative by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) since the reactions display negative deflections . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( a ) , one can see clearly that the increment of angular momentum becomes more slowly after about 125 fm / c and tends to its asymptotic value after a longer time when the reaction system may have not any further interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the moment of inertia reaches its minimum at about 40 fm / c when the reaction systems reach their maximum overlap and then increases with the reaction systems expanding . </S>",
    "<S> the angular velocity peaks at about 50 fm / c when the system has just undergone the strongest exchanges of all kinds of degrees of freedom and then becomes saturate after about 200 fm / c . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath47 has maximum at about 100 fm / c and then becomes saturate after about 200 fm / c . from above analysis </S>",
    "<S> , one can conclude that there actually exists in - plane collective rotational motion for mid - rapidity nucleons at such incident energy and impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the similar results are observed for other impact parameters . </S>",

    "<S> meanwhile , these semiquantative calculations also support the view about extracting the rotational flow from the azimuthal distribution analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the isospin dependence of the rotational flow may be a result of the competition among several mechanisms in the reaction dynamics , such as the symmetry energy , isospin dependent _ n - n _ cross sections , coulomb energy , the surface properties of the colliding nuclei , and so on . here , </S>",

    "<S> 4 ( a ) we use @xmath49 ( no symmetry energy ) and cugnon s _ n - n _ cross section @xmath50 which is isospin independent . </S>",
    "<S> it is indicated that @xmath21 of @xmath0fe + @xmath0fe is slightly less than that of @xmath0ni + @xmath0ni , which may result from the difference of coulomb interaction and surface properties between the two systems . </S>",

    "<S> one can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 that the values of @xmath16 are very small since the transverse momentum disappears at mid - rapidity and meanwhile can find that the symmetry energy enhances the rotational flow ( @xmath21 ) while @xmath52 reduces it more strongly . </S>",
