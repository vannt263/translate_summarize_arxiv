    "<S> we experimentally demonstrated the hong - ou - mandel  ( hom ) interference between two photons after visible - to - telecommunication wavelength conversion . in the experiment , we prepared a heralded single photon by using spontaneous parametric down - conversion and the other photon from a weak laser source at 780 nm . </S>",
    "<S> we converted the wavelength of both photons to the telecommunication wavelength of 1522 nm by using difference - frequency generation in a periodically - poled lithium niobate , and then observed the hom interference between the photons . the observed visibility is @xmath0 which clearly shows the non - classical interference of the two photons . </S>",
    "<S> the high - visibility interference is an important step for fiber - based quantum communications of photons generated from visible photon emitters .    quantum interface for wavelength conversion of photons  @xcite is an important building block for linking quantum information among different kinds of physical systems , and it has been actively studied  @xcite . especially , for optical - fiber - based quantum communication over a long distance with quantum repeaters  @xcite , wavelength conversion of photons entangled with quantum memories to telecommunication bands without destroying their quantum information is required . </S>",
    "<S> many promising quantum memories have resonant wavelengths at the visible range  @xcite , which necessitates a quantum interface for visible - to - telecommunication wavelength conversion .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in order to establish an entanglement between the remote quantum memories through two - photon interference  @xcite , two down - converted telecom photons should be detected by the bell measurement  ( bm ) at the intermediate relay node , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : concept ] . in the bm </S>",
    "<S> , the two telecom photons must be indistinguishable , and cause non - classical interference , i.e. the hong - ou - mandel  ( hom ) interference  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement - preserving visible - to - telecommunication wavelength conversions have been demonstrated in  @xcite , and highly entangled states have been observed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the hom interference at the relay node has never been demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> related experiments have been restricted to the hom interference between up - converted visible photons  @xcite .    in this letter , we present the first demonstration of the hom interference between two light pulses at the telecommunication band after frequency down - conversion , which matches up with fiber - based quantum communication with quantum repeaters . </S>",
    "<S> we initially prepared two pulses at 780 nm , one being a heralded single photon generated from spontaneous parametric down - conversion  ( spdc ) and the other being a coherent light pulse directly from the laser . </S>",
    "<S> their wavelengths were converted to 1522 nm by difference - frequency generation  ( dfg ) using a periodically - poled linbo@xmath1  ( ppln ) waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> we then observed the hom interference between the converted light pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the interference visibility was @xmath0 , which clearly exceeds the maximum value of 0.5 in the classical wave theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison to our theoretical analysis shows that the degradation of the visibility is mainly caused by the multi - photon events from the coherent light pulse , which suggests that the demonstrated frequency down - converter will enable us to achieve a visibility as high as 0.91 .    a conceptual setup of the hom interference after the wavelength conversion in our experiment is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : concept2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the two input visible light pulses are a coherent light pulse and a heralded single photon . </S>",
    "<S> the two pulses have no correlations and they are regarded as prepared from independent sources  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two visible light pulses are frequency down - converted to the telecommunication wavelength , and then they are combined by a half beamsplitter  ( bs ) . when the photons from the two pulses are indistinguishable , they always leave the same output port of the bs . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the photons may appear in both output ports if these are not completely indistinguishable . by measuring the coincidence photon detection between the two output modes of the bs </S>",
    "<S> while changing the time delay @xmath2 between the two light pulses , we observe the hom dip . in the classical wave theory , </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of the visibility of the hom interference is @xmath3 .    the experimental setup for the hom interference is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ]  ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> a pico - second light pulse from a mode - locked ti : sapphire  ( ti : s ) laser  ( wavelength : 780 nm ; pulse width : @xmath41.2 ps ; repetition rate : 82 mhz ) is divided into two beams . </S>",
    "<S> one beam is frequency doubled  ( wavelength : 390 nm ; power : 200 mw ) by second harmonic generation  ( shg ) , and then pumps a type - i phase - matched 1.5mm - thick @xmath5-barium borate  ( bbo ) crystal to generate a vertically(v)-polarized photon pair in modes a and b through spdc . </S>",
    "<S> the photon in mode a is measured by a superconducting single photon detector  ( sspd )  @xcite denoted by @xmath6 for preparing a heralded single photon in mode b. the spectral filtering of the photon in mode a is performed by a bragg grating  ( bg1 ) with a bandwidth of @xmath70.2 nm . the other beam is weakened to an average photon number of @xmath8 by using a glass plate  ( gp ) , and is sent along the same light path as the photon b. time difference between the photon b and the subsequent coherent light pulse is set to be @xmath9 ps which is longer than the temporal resolution @xmath10 ps of the detectors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two light pulses in the visible range are then sent to the frequency down - converter .    in the frequency </S>",
    "<S> down - converter , a v - polarized cw pump laser at 1600 nm with an effective power of 500 mw is combined with the signal beams at 780 nm by a dichroic mirror  ( dm ) . </S>",
    "<S> they are focused on the type-0 quasi - phase matched ppln waveguide  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the length of the ppln crystal is 20 mm and the acceptable bandwidth is calculated to be @xmath110.3 nm . after passing through the ppln waveguide </S>",
    "<S> , the strong pump light is reduced by a high - pass filter  ( hpf ) , and the light converted to the wavelength of 1522 nm is extracted by bg2a and bg2b with bandwidths of @xmath12 1 nm .    the light pulses from the frequency down - converter are split into a short path  ( s ) and a long path  ( l ) by a bs . time difference between s and l is changed by mirrors  ( m ) on a motorized stage . the pulses passing through s and l are mixed by a second bs for the hom interference . the two output beams from the bs are coupled to single - mode fibers followed by two sspds @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    an electric signal from @xmath6 is connected to a time - to - digital converter  ( tdc ) as a start signal of a clock , and electric signals from @xmath13 and @xmath14 are connected to the tdc as stop signals . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ]  ( b ) shows the histograms of the delayed coincidence counts of @xmath6&@xmath13 and @xmath6&@xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the central peak among the observed three peaks in each histogram includes the events where two photons simultaneously arrived at the bs , i.e. , the heralded single photon passed through path l and the coherent light pulse passed through path s. therefore , to see the hom interference , we collect the coincidence events within 300-ps time windows of the two central peaks , which corresponds to the threefold coincidence events among @xmath6 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that while the duration of the converted light pulse is @xmath15 ps , the observed widths of the peaks shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ]  ( b ) are much larger , coming from the timing resolution of our measurement system . </S>",
    "<S> the 300-ps time window was chosen such that the tails of the left and right peaks are negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental result of the dependency of the threefold coincidence counts on the optical delay is shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> each point was recorded for 23 hours . </S>",
    "<S> the observed visibility of @xmath0 at the zero delay point was obtained by the best fit to the experimental data with a gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> the full width at half maximum was approximately @xmath16 mm which corresponds to @xmath17 ps for a delay time . </S>",
    "<S> the high visibility clearly shows the non - classical interference of the two light pulses converted to the telecommunication band .    to see the reasons for the degradation of the visibility </S>",
    "<S> , we construct a theoretical model which takes into account the mode mismatch between the two pulses , and vacuum and multi - photon components in the coherent light pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the emission rate of the photon pair from the spdc is so small that the multiple - pair events are negligible in our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the heralded single photon is assumed to be in a pure state because the narrow - band spectral filtering destroys the spectral correlation between the photon pairs from spdc . under the assumptions , the initial state composed of the single photon in mode @xmath18 and the light in the coherent state in mode @xmath19 , which are shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : concept2 ] , is regarded as a pure state described by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the vacuum state for both paths , @xmath22 is a bosonic creation operator and @xmath23 with complex number @xmath24 is a displacement operator . </S>",
    "<S> the subscripts denote the modes on which the operators work .    in the experiment for the hom interference , </S>",
    "<S> the two light pulses are mixed at the bs and detected by threshold photon detectors which can not distinguish the photon numbers and which have the same quantum efficiency denoted by @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> such a measurement is equivalent to photon detections with unit efficiency after the lights pass through a lossy channel with transmittance @xmath25 and then they are mixed by the bs  @xcite . as a result , by using effective overall transmittance @xmath26 which includes all of the photonic losses in the circuit such as the conversion efficiency of the frequency down - converter and the quantum efficiency of the detector , the input state of the light pulses in modes @xmath27 and @xmath28 to the bs is regarded as @xmath29 with probability @xmath26 and as @xmath30 with probability @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> two light pulses in modes @xmath27 and @xmath28 are mixed at the bs and channeled into paths @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that mode @xmath27 is transformed into modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and mode @xmath28 is transformed into modes @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap between modes @xmath34 and @xmath36  ( @xmath35 and @xmath37 ) represented by @xmath38|^2 = |[\\hat{a}_{y_a } , { \\hat{a } ^\\dagger}_{y_b}]|^2 $ ] depends on the time delay @xmath39 , and it may not be unity even for @xmath40 due to the mismatch in the spectral shapes of the pulses . when the normalized spectral amplitudes of modes @xmath27 and @xmath28 are assumed to be gaussian with variances of @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively , the overlap @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{vw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our experiment , by using @xmath451.2  ps , @xmath460.2  nm , @xmath470.3  nm and @xmath481  nm which are the full widths at the half maxima , and by assuming that all spectral functions are gaussian , @xmath49 is calculated to be larger than @xmath50 .    we also take into account the effect of background noises which include the raman scattering of the cw pump light and the dark counts of the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> while the optical noise caused by the raman scattering may interfere with the pico - second signal photons , such contribution is negligible in the 300-ps time window . </S>",
    "<S> we thus model the effect of these noises as a single parameter @xmath51 , such that each of detectors signals a detection with probability @xmath51 even when no photons are incident . the twofold coincidence probability between the light pulses after the bs is described by @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 represents the vacuum state of path @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 is a unitary operator for the action of the bs , and it satisfies @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . by using @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 under the condition that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are satisfied . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ptau ] ) , we see that the denominator consists of two factors originating from the vacuum component and the multi - photon components in the coherent state . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , there is an optimal value of @xmath67 for minimizing @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ptau ] ) and the observed parameters as @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the optimal value becomes @xmath71 . in our experiment , we chose @xmath72 which implies that the contribution from the multi - photons is larger .    by using our experimental parameters </S>",
    "<S> , we plotted a curve predicted by the theoretical model written in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ptau ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the curve is in good agreement with the experimental result . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> the main reason for the degradation of the visibility is estimated to be the effect of the multi - photons in the coherent light pulse , and thus the demonstrated frequency down - converter is expected to have small adverse effects in the interference . if we replace the coherent light pulse by a heralded single photon prepared similarly to the mode b in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] , the visibility of the two - photon interference will become @xmath73 as a result of the above analysis . such a situation is more compatible with the conceptual setup in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : concept ] .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the hom interference of the two light pulses which are frequency down - converted to the telecommunication wavelength of 1522 nm from the visible wavelength of 780 nm . </S>",
    "<S> we observed a visibility of @xmath0 , which clearly shows the non - classical interference of the two light pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical analysis indicates that the degradation of the visibility is mainly caused by the multi - photons in the coherent light pulse , and the visibility expected when we use heralded single photons for the photon sources is @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the high - visibility wavelength conversion will be one of the key devices for many applications of quantum communication over long distance such as quantum repeaters .    </S>",
