    "all bodies are surrounded by a fluctuating electromagnetic field due to the thermal and quantum fluctuations of the charge and current density inside the bodies . outside the bodies this fluctuating electromagnetic field exists partly in the form of propagating electromagnetic waves and partly in the form of evanescent waves .",
    "the theory of the fluctuating electromagnetic field was developed by rytov @xcite .",
    "a great variety of phenomena such as casimir - lifshitz forces @xcite , near - field radiative heat transfer @xcite , and friction forces @xcite can be described using this theory .",
    "in @xcite we used the dynamical modification of the lifshitz theory to calculate the friction force between two plane parallel surfaces in parallel relative motion with velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the calculation of the van der waals friction is more complicated than of the casimir - lifshitz force and the radiative heat transfer because it requires the determination of the electromagnetic field between moving boundaries .",
    "the solution can be found by writing the boundary conditions on the surface of each body in the rest reference frame of this body .",
    "the relation between the electromagnetic fields in the different reference frames is determined by the lorenz transformation . in @xcite the electromagnetic field in the vacuum gap between the bodies was calculated to linear order in @xmath1 , which give the contribution to the friction force to order @xmath2 .",
    "these relativistic corrections were neglected within the non - relativistic theory developed in@xcite .",
    "the same non - relativistic theory was used in@xcite to calculate the frictional drag between quantum wells , and in @xcite to calculate the friction force between flat parallel surfaces in normal relative motion . in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented a rigorous quantum mechanical calculation using the kubo formula for the friction coefficient .",
    "this calculation confirmed the correctness of the approach based on the dynamical modification of the lifshitz theory , at least to linear order in the sliding velocity @xmath0 . for a review of the van der waals friction",
    "see @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we developed a fully relativistic theory of the casimir - lifshitz forces and the radiative heat transfer at non - equilibrium conditions , when the interacting bodies are at different temperatures , and they move relative to each other with the arbitrary velocity @xmath0 . in comparison with previous calculations@xcite , we did not make any approximation in the lorentz transformation of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this allowed us to determine the field in one reference frame , knowing the same field in another reference frame .",
    "thus , the solution of the electromagnetic problem was exact . knowing the electromagnetic field we calculated the stress tensor and the poynting vector which determined the casimir - lifshitz forces and the heat transfer , respectively .",
    "taking the limit when one of the bodies is rarefied , it is possible to obtain the casimir - lifshits force and friction , and the radiative heat transfer for a small particle - surface configuration .",
    "however , in this approach additional approximations were made which did not allow to make detailed comparison with other theories of friction for the particle - surface configuration in ultra relativistic case .",
    "the problem of friction for a small neutral particle moving parallel to a solid surface ( particle - surface configuration ) was considered by number of authors ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . at present the interest in this problem",
    "is increasing because it is linked to quantum cherenkov radiation @xcite .",
    "recently a fully covariant theory of friction in particle - surface configuration was proposed by pieplow and henkel ( ph ) @xcite and comparison with results of previous authors was given .",
    "the theory presented by ph agrees with relativistic theory proposed by dedkov and kyasov ( dk ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the friction between a particle and solid surface , mediated by evanescent electromagnetic waves , can be extracted from friction acting between two plates assuming that one plate is sufficiently rarefied @xcite .",
    "a fully relativistic theory of friction between two plates in parallel relative motion ( plate - plate configuration ) was developed in @xcite . in the present comment",
    "the friction in particle - plate configuration is calculated from the friction in plate - plate configuration assuming that one plate is sufficiently rarefied .",
    "we compare our results with the results of ref .",

    "* 2 * is at rest while body * 1 * is moving with velocity @xmath16 along the @xmath8 axis .",
