    "each sector contained in @xmath15 is faithfully parametrized by the gelfand spectrum @xmath18 of the centre @xmath19 .",

    "owing to the snag theorem due to the abelianness of @xmath30 , its unitary representation @xmath86 admits the spectral decomposition @xmath87 , corresponding to which @xmath88 has the spectral decompostion given by@xmath89 in the dirac notation , the action of @xmath88 on @xmath90 is given for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , by@xmath93 to understand the physical meaning of the above quantities , we introduce some such vocabularies @xcite as ` probe system ' and ` neutral position ' in measurement processes : the former means the _ microscopic end _ of the measuring apparatus _ at its microscopic contact point _ with the observed system , and the latter the _ initial _ ( _ microscopic _ ) _ state of the probe system corresponding to the macroscopically stable position of the measuring pointer realized when the apparatus is isolated_.    to see clearly the essence of the formulation , we assume that @xmath94 is discrete ( or , equivalently , @xmath30 is compact ) ; then we can plug into @xmath95 and @xmath92 in eq.([eqn : ft ] ) , respectively , the group identity @xmath96 and such an eigenstate @xmath97 as @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) of @xmath40 , which gives@xmath100 namely , corresponding to the eigenstate @xmath101 of @xmath24 found in the observed system , the coupling unitary @xmath88 causes such a state change as @xmath102 in the probe system .",

    "as all what can be realized in this case is known @xcite to be the _ approximate measurements _ , the formula corresponding to eq.([eqn : ft2 ] ) can be given by eq .",

    "the k - t operators are seen to fullfil the necessary tasks for materializing the physical essence of measurements in the mathematical formulation : the k - t operator @xmath72 determines the coupling between the observed and the measuring systems and its fourier transform @xmath88 given by eq.([eqn : ft ] ) establishes the ` perfect correlation ' @xcite .    integrating all the ingredients relevant to our measurement scheme",
    ", we define an instrument @xmath109 as a completely positive operation - valued measure as follows : @xmath110 where @xmath111 s.t .",
    "@xmath112 is an initial state of the observed system , @xmath113 an arbitrary probability measure with respect to which the spectral measure @xmath114 of @xmath70 is absolutely continuous : @xmath115 , and @xmath116 the indicator function of a borel set @xmath117 to which the measured values of @xmath24 belongs .",
    "the spectral measure @xmath114 is just the _ effect _ of the measurement , from which our k - t operator @xmath88 can be reconstructed by @xmath118 . in this sense ,",
    "the _ three notions _ , the k - t operator @xmath88 , the effect @xmath114 and the instrument @xmath119 , _ are all mutually equivalent_. the most important essence of the statistical interpretation in the measurement processes is summarized in this notion of instrument as follows : the probability distribution for measured values of observables in @xmath24 to be found in a borel set @xmath117 is given by @xmath120 and , associated with this , the initial state @xmath121 of the observed system is changed by the read - out of measured values in @xmath122 into a final state given in such a form as @xmath123 @xcite , according to which a process of the so - called ` reduction of wave packets ' is described . incidentally ,",
    "the reason for the relevance of the _ fourier transform _ from @xmath84 to @xmath124 can naturally be understood in relation with the duality between the ( algebra of ) observables and the states : when the group @xmath30 acts on the algebra @xmath21 of the observed system , the corresponding states can be parametrized by  @xmath36 as eigenstates  w.r.t .",
    "the action @xmath70 of @xmath30 , which should also be read out as the measured values .    by means of the instrument @xmath109 ,",
    "a measurement process is described as the process of state changes due to the measurement coupling @xmath73 which transforms an _ initial _",
    "state @xmath121 of the observed system _ decoupled _ from the probe system into _ final _ ones of the same nature , in parallel with the _ scattering processes _ described in terms of the _ incoming _ and _ outgoing _ asymptotic states of free particles .",
    "the algebra describing the composite system is the tensor algebra @xmath125 realized in the _ initial _ and _ final _ stages , respectively , before and after the measuring processes according to the _ switching - on _ and _ -off of the coupling _ @xmath73 . as incoming and outgoing asymptotic fields , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , in quantum field theory",
    "are interpolated by _ interacting heisenberg fields _",
    "@xmath128 , we can consider a similar description of the composite system of @xmath21 and @xmath24 with the coupled dynamics @xmath49 incorporated at the level of the algebra which interpolates the initial and final decoupled system @xmath26 .",
    "this is given by the notion of the crossed products @xmath46 of the algebra due to the action @xmath49 of @xmath30 on @xmath21 , in terms of which the effect of the measuring coupling in the measurement process can be seen in such a form as @xmath129 , in parallel with the scattering processes , @xmath130 . in terms of the k - t operators , the crossed product @xmath131 as an important notion in the fourier - galois duality",
    "is defined on @xmath132 in the following two equivalent ways : either as a von neumann algebra @xmath133 generated by the fourier transform @xmath134 of @xmath21-valued @xmath135-functions",
    "@xmath136 with the convolution product , @xmath137 , mapped by @xmath138 into @xmath139 , or , as a von neumann algebra @xmath140 generated by @xmath141 and by @xmath142 these two versions are related by the mapping @xmath143 , @xmath144 which can be understood as the schrdinger and heisenberg pictures : the former @xmath145 is in the schrdinger picture with _",
    "unchanged _ microscopic observables @xmath146 and with the _ coupling _ @xmath147 _ to change macroscopic states _ , while , in the latter , all the coupling effects are concentrated in the observables @xmath148 in contrast to the _ kinematical changes _ of macroscopic _ states _ caused by @xmath149 .    in the case of the instrument ,",
    "the effects of the measurement coupling @xmath88 are encoded in the form of _ macroscopic state _",
    "_ changes _ recorded in the spectrum of the non - trivial centre @xmath150 of @xmath26 , playing the same roles as the order parameters to specify sectors in the inter - sectorial context . for these reasons , the most natural physical essence of the formalism in terms of an instrument @xmath109 can be found in the _ interaction picture _ , whose _ coupling _ term @xmath151 is responsible for deforming the decoupled algebra @xmath152 into the above crossed product @xmath153 .",
    "to clarify the natural meaning of the above scheme , we note a useful analogy of the duality coupling to the familiar _ complementarity of dna _ between a(denine ) and t(hymine ) and between g(uanine ) and c(ytosine ) , repectively : the role of the coupling between @xmath154 and @xmath155 in the k - t operator @xmath118 is just similar to that of the complementarity of a - t and g - c , as the former implements the _ transcription _ of the data @xmath156 in the object system to the probe system in the form of @xmath157 similarly to the latter case .    at this point",
    ", we note that the above standard description of measurement processes in terms of an instrument implicitly presupposes that the _ quantum_-theoretical processes , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , taking place at the _ microscopic _ contact point of the observed and the probe systems can be directly interpreted as the measured data @xmath156 identifiable with a position of the measuring pointer visible at the _ macroscopic level_. there exist certain mathematical and/or physical gaps between these two levels which need be filled up : to adjust theoretical descriptions to the realistic experimental situations , we need to discuss how these changes of probe systems dynamically propagate into macroscopic motions of the measuring pointer .",
    "this is just the problem of the _ amplification _ processes to amplify the invisible quantum state changes in the probe system into the macroscopic data registered in some visible form of suitable order parameters .",
    "( continuuing the above analogy to the dna , the aspect of amplification can naturally be compared with the process of _ pcr_[= polymer chain reaction ] to amplify the sequential data of dna . ) in the next section , we formulate its general and abstract essence in mathematical terms , by which the notion of the instrument need be supplemented . in view of the inevitable noises in the actual experiment situations , it is also necessary to show how the relevant information survives to reach the macroscopically visible level , which requires the estimates of the disturbance terms in the form of adiabaticity condition as will be done in ",
    "[ example ] .",
    "we note here such a remarkable property inherent in the regular representation of @xmath36 as the mutual quasi - equivalence , @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) , among its arbitrary tensor powers @xmath162 , as seen by the repeated use of the intertwining relation @xmath163 of the k - t operator @xmath164 : @xmath165 on this basis , we can formulate a dynamical process of amplification @xcite in terms of a unitary action @xmath166 of @xmath167 on the tensor algebra @xmath168 with @xmath169defined by @xmath170 which is similar to the formulation of quantum markov chain due to accardi @xcite .",
    "when @xmath36 is discrete , this process can be seen in a more clear - cut way in the schrdinger picture:@xmath171   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is a generic state @xmath92 of the observed system . according to the general basic idea of ` quantum - classical correspondence ' ,",
    "a classical macroscopic object is to be identified with a _ condensed state of infinite number of quanta _ , as well exemplified by the macroscopic magnetization of ising or heisenberg ferromagnets described by the aligned states @xmath172 of ` infinite number ' @xmath173 of microscopic spins .",
    "likewise , the states @xmath174 and latexmath:[$|\\gamma\\rangle^{\\otimes n}:=\\underset { n}{\\underbrace{|\\gamma\\rangle\\otimes|\\gamma\\rangle\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes    interpreted as representing macroscopic positions of the measuring pointer corresponding , respectively , to the initial and final probe states parametrized by @xmath108 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus the above repeated action @xmath176 of the k - t operator @xmath164 describes a cascade process or a domino effect  of ` decoherence ' ,  which , triggered by the initial data @xmath177 of the observed system , amplifies a probe state change @xmath178 of the measuring pointer .    in view of the above aspects , we define a unified version of the instrument combined with the amplification process : @xmath179 in terms of which we can give an affirmative answer to the question posed at the end of the previous section ,  2 , concerning the realistic meaning of the quantity @xmath122 as the actual data to be read out from the measuring pointer . to this end",
    ", we show the equality @xmath180 between the usual and the above instruments as follows : assuming the discreteness of @xmath36 for simplicity , we calculate for @xmath181 , @xmath182 which reduces for @xmath183 to such a familiar result as @xmath184 since @xmath185 gives precisely the probability of finding a _ macroscopic _ state @xmath186 , we have observed just the agreement of the probability distributions between the one arising from the microscopic system - probe coupling and the final result realized through the amplification process .",
    "this fact ensures the pertinence of instruments for the description of measurements , giving a clear - cut version of quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "the unitarity  of the above amplification process is guaranteed by the quasi - equivalence relations among arbitrary tensor powers @xmath187 of the regular representation @xmath188 of @xmath36 .",
    "it can also explain the possibility of the recurrent quantum interference even after the contact of a quantum system with the measuring apparatus when the number @xmath189 of repetition need not be regarded as a real infinity .",
    "this point is evident from eq.([ldp ] ) which is valid independently of @xmath190 .",
    "in general , the problem as to whether the situation is made ` completely '  classical or not depends highly on the relative configurations among many large or small numbers , which can consistently be described in the framework of the non - standard analysis ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in close relation to this",
    ", it is also interesting to note that the above amplification process is related to a lvy process through its ` infinite divisibility '  as follows : similarly to the affine property @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) of a map @xmath193 defined on a convex set following from the additivity @xmath194 , we can extrapolate the relation @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) into @xmath197 , which means the infinite divisibility  @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) of the process induced by the above transformation . in this way",
    ", we see that simple individual measurements with definite measured values are connected without gaps with discrete and/or continuous repetitions of measurements @xcite .",
    "if this formulation exhausts the essence of the problem , the remaining tasks reduce to its physical and/or technical implementation through suitable choices of the media connecting the microscopic contact point between the system and the apparatus to the measuring pointer . in such contexts , we need to examine some aspects concerning the stability of the information transmitted from microscopic to macroscopic levels , as will be seen in the next section .",
    "in this section we apply the scheme developed so far to the experimental situation of stern - gerlach type to check the validity of its general essence and to attain a deeper understanding of it through the concrete example .",
    "we will find also the necessity of some generalization or modification for adapting the scheme to actual situations .",
    "the essence of stern - gerlach experiments @xcite can be found in the coupling between the ( spin and/or orbital ) angular momentum of the quantum particles ( such as atoms or electrons ) and the inhomogeneous external magnetic field , according to which the _ microscopic _ differences in the _ _ quantized directions of angular momentum are amplified into the _",
    "macroscopic _ distance of the arriving points of the particle . for simplicity",
    ", we consider here the spin @xmath200 @xmath201 of an electron ( with spin @xmath202 ) , whose associated magnetic moment @xmath203@xmath200 couples to the magnetic field via the interaction term @xmath203@xmath204@xmath205 : through the @xmath206-dependence of @xmath207 due to its inhomogeneity , this coupling causes the orbital change of the electron according to its spin direction ( _ up _ or _ down _ ) with respect to the defined axis ( see fig.[setting ] in  [ s - g ] ) . thus the magnetic field @xmath207 is seen to play a double role ; the coupling @xmath208@xmath200@xmath209 causes , on the one hand , the _ spectral decomposition _ of the quantum spin @xmath200 , and it causes , on the other hand , the _ amplification process _ through its dependence on @xmath206 . through the process",
    ", we can ` see ' the quantum spin variable of the electron as the separation of its spatial orbits ( or , more directly , the arriving points on the screen ) .",
    "thus the two states @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively , of spin up and down , can be distinguished through the amplification process caused by the stern - gerlach measurement apparatus .    in  [ amplification ]",
    "the amplification process was formulated in its idealized abstract form in terms of the homogeneous repetition by a k - t operator . in the present case of stern - gerlach experiment ,",
    "however , the coupling between the electron and the inhomogeneous magnetic field depends on the position of the moving electron , owing to which the unitary coupling term @xmath212@xmath200@xmath213 $ ] depends on the position @xmath206 of the electron along its trajectory . at the same time , any amplification processes can not get rid of _ noise effects _ to disturb the ideal separations between upward and downward electron beams corresponding to macroscopically distinguishable states @xmath214 and @xmath215 , respectively .",
    "for these reasons , it is necessary to examine whether the possible spin - flips during the travel of electron through the magnetic field can sufficiently be suppressed .",
    "otherwise , frequent spin - flips may destroy the meaningful connection between the spin variables of the electrons and the points on the screen to detect them .",
    "therefore , to ensure the distinguishability and the stability in the separations of final results , some physical conditions need be supplemented to ensure that these ` error probability ' is small enough .",
    "this can be understood as a kind of ` adiabaticity condition ' related with the validity of adiabatic approximation to treat the varying and fluctuating background field .",
    "the standard setting of the stern - gerlach experiment is shown below ( see fig.[setting ] to illustrate the apparatus ) ; we prepare a given type of metal which emits the electron beam through the thermal oscillation .",
    "the thermal electronic beam enters in the inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath207 generated between magnetic poles which covers a spatial region with a length scale of the order of a meter . the orbital motion of each electron",
    "is bent upward or downward according to the directions of its spin coupled to the magnetic field ; the microscopic state determined by the direction of electron spin as an invisible _ internal _ degree of freedom is thus converted into the visible macroscopic form of spatial separations of the spots on the screen caused by the electrons .    from here , we focus on the situation for detecting the spin direction consisting of an electron with spin @xmath202 , mass @xmath216 , charge @xmath217 , magnetic moment @xmath203(@xmath218 with magnetic permeability @xmath219 of vacuum ) and of the external magnetic field whose direction is supposed to be fixed in the @xmath220-axis .        for applying our general scheme",

    "these latter directions can be understood as the ` amplified '  states , @xmath307 and @xmath260 with the upper / lower points on the target screen .",
    "it is remarkable that the coupling unitary @xmath308   $ ] characteristic of the stern - gerlach experiment contains the two kinds of k - t operators , the one , @xmath309 , to couple the quantum observable @xmath200 with the angle variable @xmath310 and the other one , @xmath311 , corresponding to the translations @xmath312 of @xmath220 due to the @xmath220-dependence of @xmath306 , the latter of which is responsible for the direct amplification of the former coupling .",
    "this explains a dynamical mechanism to transcribe the information on the spin direction into the momentum change in the orbital motion of the electron , which allows us to achieve the quantitative estimation as shown above .    aside from the stern - gerlach case ,",
    "a unitary coupling of the similar nature has been found in @xcite .",
    "our focus here is , however , to clarify the universal essence of such couplings _ via external fields _ , which seems impossible without the use of k - t operators .      in the above discussion for deriving the momentum change of the electron , we neglected such secondary effects as the terms come from @xmath313 or @xmath314 .",
    "since these effects are outside the scope of the above _ ideal _ situation of amplification , we need to estimate them as correction terms in the next step . without the necessity to develop the general method for treating these secondary terms ,",
    "we already know some of typical methodology for these estimation ; in some cases ( including the stern - gerlach case ) it would be called ` adiabaticity conditions ' . for stern - gerlach experiment",
    ", this condition can be interpreted as the one under which the effect of _ spin - flips _ caused by the factor @xmath315 remains small enough compared with that of @xmath316 . in this section",
    ", we confirm that the adiabaticity condition surely gives the consistency in the present context by an elementary discussion .    `",
    "adiabatic perturbation '  originally means a coupling of a quantum system with an external force which changes the system slowly enough in comparison to the typical time scales of intrinsic transitions among quantum states but whose changes _ along the direction of condensed order parameters _ can eventually accumulate into a visible size .",
    "the general essence of the adiabaticity can be formulated in such a condition as @xmath317 , in terms of the rate of change of the matrix elements of hamiltonian @xmath272 defined by @xmath318 between the initial and final states with the energies @xmath319 and @xmath320 , respectively .",
    "the physical meaning of the quantity @xmath321 can be understood by the following reformulation of it : @xmath322 with @xmath323 which sets up the standard time scale for the comparison .",
    "the requirement @xmath317 can now be understood as the self - consistency condition for a process to change the values of the order parameters describing a given inter - sectorial structure of the quantum - classical composite system , without destroying the whole sector structure : if the change rate @xmath324 of the hamiltonian is very small , it should be almost perpendicular to the main ` tangential direction '  of the changes caused by the external force in favour of the change in the order parameters .",
    "therefore , @xmath290 can be interpreted as the ` almost intrinsic '  time scale of the microscopic motions of the intra - sectorial quantum system put in a background with slowly changing order parameters , in which @xmath325 can represent , for instance , the frequency of the light emitted in the transition .",
    "then the numerator in @xmath326 is the change @xmath327 of the matrix element of @xmath272 from the initial @xmath328 to final states @xmath193 _ caused by the adiabatic perturbation _ during the time interval @xmath290 , which is to be compared with the denominator @xmath329 given by the energy _ _  _ _ difference _ almost intrinsic to the quantum system_.    going back to the stern - gerlach case , the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath330 the decomposition of the external magnetic field into its @xmath220-component @xmath316 and the remaining @xmath313 can be understood as the one into the directions to preserve and to disturb the sector structure according to the eigenvalues of @xmath257 .",
    "therefore , the dominant term in this hamiltonian to disturb the spin direction due to the spin - flips is identified with @xmath331 the size of the effect due to this term should be estimated to preserve the visibility aspect due to @xmath316 .",
    "as each trajectory of electron can be considered as a smooth curve in @xmath239 parameterized by the _ time _",
    "parameter @xmath332 , the time derivative of @xmath333 is calculated as @xmath334 here we introduce an approximation @xmath335 . in terms of a basis of eigenstates of @xmath257 , we can estimate and obtain a representation of off - diagonal matrix elements@xmath336 under the assumption that the velocity @xmath337 of the electron can be replaced by the typical velocity @xmath338 of thermal electrons .",
    "owing to the first condition for @xmath339 to be adiabatic , the derivative of the external magnetic field can be approximated in the context of the estimate by @xmath340 , where @xmath341 represents the range in which the magnetic field exists .    in terms of the larmor frequency of the thermal electron @xmath342 ,",
    "the changing rate in which we are interested is essentially given by @xmath343 in the use of the rotation - free condition @xmath344 of the magnetic field @xmath345 .",
    "thus the adiabaticity condition @xmath317 can be written down as @xmath346 this inequality is nothing but the condition imposed on the arrangement of external magnetic field in order to guarantee the ideal amplification of spin variables .",
    "in this paper we have formulated a unified scheme of measurement and amplification processes based on the notion of micro - macro duality . in this context , the duality relation ( or , in more general contexts , adjunction ) between @xmath21 as the microscopic system and @xmath25 as the macroscopic observational data controlled by the k - t operator has played the essential role , on the basis of which we have obtained a clear understanding of how microscopic states are amplified into macroscopic level as discussed in  [ amplification ] .",
    "we hope that this essence of amplification processes will shed some new lights on various problems involving different scales or levels ( especially , ` micro ' and ` macro ' ) such as the coexistence of different phases and their boundaries , the problem of emergence of macroscopic structures from microscopic worlds , and so on .",
