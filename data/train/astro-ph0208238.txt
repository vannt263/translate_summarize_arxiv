    "the class of objects referred to as blazars consists of the most extreme examples of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , namely @xmath0-ray loud , flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , and bl  lac objects .",
    "they have been observed in all wavelength bands  from radio through very - high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray frequencies .",
    "more than 65 blazars have been identified as sources of @xmath1  mev emission detected by the egret telescope on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( cgro ) @xcite , and at least 6 blazars have now been detected at vhe @xmath0-rays ( @xmath2  gev ) by ground - based air erenkov telescopes ( for a recent review see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "blazars exhibit variability at all wavelengths @xcite on time scales  in some cases  down to less than an hour @xcite .",
    "the broadband continuum spectra of blazars are dominated by non - thermal emission and consist of at least two clearly distinct , broad spectral components .",
    "a sequence of sub - classes of blazars can be defined through increasing peak frequencies and a decreasing dominance of the @xmath0-ray output in terms of @xmath3 peak flux along a sequence from fsrqs via low - frequency bl  lac objects ( lbls ) to high - frequency peaked bl  lac objects ( hbls ) , which is also correlated with a decreasing inferred bolometric luminosity of the sources @xcite . for recent reviews of the observational properties of blazars",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "although all extragalactic sources detected by ground - based air erenkov telescope facilities to date are hbls , the steadily improving flux sensitivities and decreasing energy thresholds of those instruments provide a growing potential to extend their blazar source list towards intermediate and even low - frequency peaked bl  lac objects .",
    "the detection of such objects at energies @xmath4  100  gev might provide an opportunity to probe the intrinsic high - energy cutoff of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) since at those energies , @xmath5 absorption due to the intergalactic infrared background is expected to be negligible at redshifts of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "such detections should significantly further our understanding of the relevant radiation mechanisms responsible for the high - energy emission of blazars and the underlying particle acceleration mechanisms .",
    "the low - energy component of blazar seds is well understood as synchrotron emission from ultrarelativistic electrons in a relativistic jet directed at a small angle with respect to the line of sight . in the framework of leptonic models ( for a review of the alternative class of hadronic jet models , see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) , high - energy emission will result from compton scattering of lower - frequency photons off the relativistic electrons .",
    "possible target photon fields for compton scattering are the synchrotron photons produced within the jet ( the ssc process ; @xcite ) , or external photons ( the ec process ) .",
    "sources of external seed photons include the uv  soft x - ray emission from the disk  either entering the jet directly @xcite or after reprocessing in the broad line region ( blr ) or other circumnuclear material @xcite  , jet synchrotron radiation reflected at the blr @xcite , or the infrared emission from circumnuclear dust @xcite .",
    "according to the now well - established agn unification scheme @xcite , blazars can be unified with other classes of agn , in particular radio galaxies , through orientation effects .",
    "however , @xcite have pointed out that such orientation effects can not explain the differences between different blazar sub - classes . instead",
    ", it has been suggested that the sequence of spectral properties of blazars from hbls via lbls to fsrqs can be interpreted in terms of an increasing total power input into non - thermal electrons in the jet , accompanied by an increasing contribution of external photons to the seed photon field for compton upscattering @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this may be related to an evolutionary effect due to the gradual depletion of the circumnuclear material being accreted onto the central black hole @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling of blazars in the different sub - classes ( fsrqs , lbls and hbls ) seems to confirm this conjecture ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", blazars tend to exhibit rapid flux and spectral variability .",
    "the variability is most dramatic and occurs on the shortest time scales at the high - energy ends of the two nonthermal spectral components of their broadband seds .",
    "particularly interesting variability patterns could be observed at x - ray energies for those blazars whose x - ray emission is dominated by synchrotron emission .",
    "observational studies of x - ray variability in blazars have so far focused on hbls and , in particular , on the attempt to identify clear patterns of time lags between hard and soft x - rays .",
    "however , such studies have yielded rather inconclusive and often contradictory results ( e.g. , for mrk  421 : @xcite ; or pks  2155 - 304 : @xcite ) . instead , the so - called `` spectral hysteresis '' of blazar x - ray spectral variability may prove to be a more promising diagnostic of the physical nature of acceleration and cooling processes in blazar jets : when plotting the x - ray spectral hardness vs. the x - ray flux ( hardness - intensity diagrams = hids ) , some hbls ( e.g. , mrk  421 and pks  2155 - 304 ) have been observed to trace out characteristic , clockwise loops ( @xcite ) . in terms of pure ssc jet models",
    ", such spectral hysteresis can be understood as the synchrotron radiation signature of gradual injection and/or acceleration of ultrarelativistic electrons into the emitting region , and subsequent radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "however , interestingly , such spectral hysteresis could not be confirmed in a recent series of _ xmm - newton _ observations of mrk  421 @xcite .    in lbls ,",
    "the soft x - ray emission is also sometimes dominated by the high - energy end of the synchrotron component @xcite , so similar spectral hysteresis phenomena should in principle be observable . however , those objects are generally much fainter at x - ray energies than their high - frequency peaked counterparts , making the extraction of time - dependent spectral information an observationally very challenging task ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which may require the new generation of x - ray telescopes such as _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton_. extracting the physical information contained in the rich x - ray variability patterns exhibited by bl  lac objects requires detailed theoretical modeling of the time - dependent particle acceleration and radiation transport processes in the jets of blazars .",
    "previous analyses of these processes @xcite have led to significant progress in our understanding of the particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in hbls , but were restricted to pure ssc models , with parameter choices specifically targeted towards hbls .",
    "consequently , those results may not be directly applicable to intermediate or low - frequency peaked bl  lac objects or even fsrqs .",
    "a notable exception is a recent study by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who included a significant contribution of external compton radiation to the high - energy emission of blazars , and focused on the modeling of photon - energy dependent light curves and time lags between different frequency bands .",
    "they applied their results to the fsrq 3c  279 , and concluded that the correlated x - ray/@xmath0-ray variability of this quasar was inconsistent with x - rays and @xmath0-rays being produced by the same radiation mechanism because otherwise significant systematic time lags between the @xmath0-ray and x - ray flaring behaviour would be expected , contrary to the observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the present paper , we describe a newly developed combined ssc + erc jet radiation transfer code , accounting for time - dependent particle acceleration and injection , radiative cooling , and escape , coupled to the self - consistent treatment of the relevant photon emission , absorption , and escape processes . in  [ model ] we give a brief description of the underlying blazar jet model . the numerical procedure used in our code",

    "the photon spectral index of the time - averaged emission at optical  soft x - ray frequencies remains robust at @xmath69 due to optically thin synchrotron emission from the cooled electron spectrum with injection spectral index @xmath61 .",
    "as the bolometric luminosity ( and the electron cooling ) becomes dominated by the ssc mechanism , one would expect that this changes to the canonical value of @xmath70 , which is a result of the decaying electron cooling rate in an ssc - dominated cooling scenario @xcite .",
    "however , in the situation simulated here , the first - order ssc peak is rapidly ( within @xmath71 ) decaying into the kev energy range and dominating over the instantaneous synchrotron emission at uv  x - ray energies .",
    "this leads to a significant hardening of the time - averaged optical ",

    "( see fig .",
    "[ l_inj_lc ] ) , the more rapid electron cooling with increasing electron injection power manifests itself in an overall increasing amplitude of variability at all energies .",
    "in particular , as ssc cooling becomes more important , even the harder x - rays begin to exhibit significant variability on the dynamical time scale , in contrast to the synchrotron - cooling dominated cases .",
    "furthermore , while for very low injection powers , the synchrotron cooling time scale for optical synchrotron emission is comparable to the injection time scale , resulting in a time delay of @xmath72  a few hr between x - ray and optical emission , the optical light curve peaks at the end of the injection episode for higher injection powers , simultaneously with the x - rays .",
    "however , when ssc cooling becomes dominant , the gradually increasing energy density in the soft photon field during the injection episode actually has the effect that the x - ray light curves are peaking at the beginning of the injection episode , which would , again , lead to a time delay of @xmath73  a few hr between x - ray and optical flares .    fig .",
    "[ l_inj_hic ] illustrates how the tracks in the hids at different x - ray energies are drastically changing for different injection powers . in particular at x - ray energies just below or at the synchrotron cutoff ( @xmath68  kev )",

    "specifically , the local spectral indices at the time of the peak flux are significantly smaller ( harder ) for larger values of the injection power .",
    "obvious changes in the orientation of the spectral hysteresis tracks are not found in these simulations .    as mentioned earlier ( see eq .",
    "[ tau_sy ] ) , in the test cases investigated here , the synchrotron cooling time scale of electrons emitting synchrotron radiation at x - ray energies , is shorter than the dynamical time scale , which is of the same order as the injection time scale . consequently , our results can be qualitatively compared to those of @xcite for the `` short cooling time limit '' , bearing in mind that the parameter values in our simulations have been chosen appropriate for intermediate and lbls , while @xcite focused on the application to the hbl mrk  421 .",
    "in particular the light curves displayed in their figs . 9  11 exhibit the same general trends as we have found in our set of simulations .      in order to investigate the influence of an increasing contribution of external photons to the soft photon field for compton scattering , we performed a series of simulations with increasing values of @xmath32 , from 0 to 1 .",
    "we note that the contribution from direct accretion disk photons to the photon energy density in the emitting region is negligible in our base model .",
    "thus , in the following , the external photons are primarily accretion disk photons reprocessed in the blr .",

    " where @xmath82 is the radius of the inner boundary of the blr in units of 0.2  pc  we can estimate that this happens at @xmath83 . specifically , for @xmath84 , the effect of dominant external - compton cooling results in a reduction of the time - averaged emission around the synchrotron peak  leading to a spectral hardening of the synchrotron emission  , and a suppression of the ssc emission .",
    "the suppression of the low - frequency synchrotron emission can be explained as the combined effect of two causes : first , electrons at energies above the low - energy cut - off are radiatively cooling on a time scale much shorter than the dynamical one ( see eq . [ b_decay ] below ) .",
    "consequently , the particle spectrum of high - energy electrons injected during the flare is rapidly depleted within less than one dynamical time scale from the end of the flaring episode .",
    "however , after this episode , we are still injecting electrons ( although at a much smaller rate corresponding to @xmath85 ) into the blob , which continue to present a high - energy electron population . in the case of the extremely fast cooling rate at @xmath86",
    ", this additional high - energy electron population leads to a significant additional contribution of synchrotron emission at intermediate energies beyond the down - shifted maximum energy of electrons injected during the flare and , consequently , to a hardening of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the second cause of spectral hardening of the low - frequency synchrotron spectrum is related to our parametrization of the magnetic field in terms of an equipartition parameter @xmath21 : for electron injection spectral indices @xmath87 , most of the energy in the electron population is carried by electrons near the low - energy cutoff .",
    "consequently , the co - moving magnetic field will decay on a time scale given by the radiative cooling time scale of the lowest - energy electrons , which is    @xmath88    where @xmath89 . for @xmath90 ,",
    "the time scale ( [ b_decay ] ) is of the order of or shorter than the dynamical time scale .",
    "in contrast , the energy density of the external radiation field remains approximately constant during the evolution of the blob .",
    "consequently , as radiative cooling proceeds and shifts the electron distribution towards lower energies , a steadily decreasing fraction of the electron energy will be converted to synchrotron radiation .",
    "this leads to a spectral hardening of the time - averaged synchrotron spectrum compared to the canonical @xmath91 spectrum above the break frequency @xmath92 of a cooling electron population in a constant magnetic field @xmath93 with @xmath94 . at frequencies below @xmath95",
    ", the time - averaged spectrum would have a slope of @xmath96 in the constant - magnetic - field case .",

    "the additional factor of @xmath0 results from the equipartition prescription , @xmath101 .",

    "the short - dashed curve in fig . [ ext_intspectra ] shows the result of a test calculation in which we held the magnetic field constant , while all other parameters were identical to the @xmath105 simulation , in order to verify that the spectral hardening at radio frequencies is indeed partially a consequence of our magnetic field parametrization .",
    "[ ext_lc ] shows that the impact of a strong external compton component on the optical and x - ray light curves is very moderate .",
    "in particular , the light curves at energies below the synchrotron cutoff remain virtually unchanged .",
    "however , a strong external compton component , dominating the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath84 in our case ) leads to a significantly faster decay of the light curves at x - ray energies beyond the synchrotron cutoff .",
    "just as the light curves , also the x - ray spectral hysteresis characteristics remain virtually unchanged , even in the case of a strongly dominant external compton component , except for a moderate softening of the local spectrum in the decaying phase of the flare at energies beyond the synchrotron cutoff ( see fig .",

    "an interesting qualitative change of the spectral hysteresis can be seen for energies just above the synchrotron cutoff : while for hard electron injection spectra ( @xmath108 ) , the peak flux is reached at a steep local x - ray spectrum ( i.e. the spectrum is dominated by the synchrotron component at the time of peak flux ) , a soft injection spectrum ( @xmath106 ) leads to a hard local spectral index at the time of peak flux ( i.e. the spectrum is dominated by the ssc component at that time ) .      in order to investigate the influence of the duration of the electron injection event causing the flare , we have performed simulations with 3 different values of @xmath110 , where we kept the total energy input during the flare constant ( simulations no . 2 , 11 , and 12 ) .",
    "the time - averaged seds from those simulations are virtually indistinguishable .",

    "the decaying portion of the light curves at optical and x - ray frequencies seems to be virtually independent of the duration of the injection event . in the x - ray spectral hysteresis ( fig .",
    "[ duration_hic ] ) , we find that for longer electron injection events , the rising - flux portion of the track in the hid at x - ray energies below the synchrotron cutoff occurs with increasingly softer local spectra , whereas the decaying portion remains virtually unchanged . at energies above the synchrotron peak ,",
    "the trend concerning the rising portion is opposite : with longer duration of the injection episode , the local spectra are becoming harder .    from an observational point of view",
    ", one should be able to distinguish situations in which the duration of the flaring event is substantially longer than the dynamical time scale , by virtue of the extended high - flux plateaus at energies below the synchrotron peak , which are generally not observed in bl  lac objects in which there is evidence for a substantial contribution from synchrotron emission to the x - ray flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this seems to indicate that the generic situation of @xmath111 might be a realistic assumption .",
    "the step function time profile of the electron injection power during the flare is certainly a rather crude over - simplification of any realistic acceleration scenario . in order to investigate whether this particular choice of the time profile has a significant impact on our results ,",
    "we have calculated an additional set of simulations ( nos .",
    "13  15 ) , with triangular injection profiles . here",
    ", we have introduced a linear rise and decay of the injection power on time scales @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , and have chosen the maximum of the profile to be twice the injection power of the step - function case in order to keep the total injected energy at the same value as in our base model .",
    "the time - averaged photon spectra for all of these cases are virtually identical .",
    "equally , the light curves at energies above the synchrotron cutoff are only marginally affected by the details of the injection time profile ( see fig . [ profile_lc ] ) , while at lower energies the light curves tend to track the injection time profile to a certain extent during the rising portion of the light curves .",
    "the decaying portion of the light curves is generally independent of the injection time profile for all optical and x - ray photon energies .",
    "[ profile_hic ] illustrates that the impact of the detailed injection profile on the x - ray spectral hysteresis characteristics is rather moderate , even for the extreme ( and very artificial ) cases of the time profiles c ( gradual rise over @xmath114 , sharp decay ) and d ( sharp rise , gradual decay over @xmath114 ) illustrated here .",
    "its influence is basically restricted to the flux - rise portion of the hid track and to photon energies below the synchrotron cut - off , where the local spectra tend to be harder for time profiles with maxima closer to the onset of the flare .",
    "the hid tracks for all our test cases show almost identical spectral indices at the time of maximum flux .      at the low - energy end of the electron spectra , particles cooling down from higher energies",
    "will either accumulate and build up a @xmath115 power - law spectrum at energies below @xmath9 , or escape , depending on the value of the escape time scale parameter @xmath116 .",
    "we can define a critical escape parameter    @xmath117    for which the escape time scale for electrons at energy @xmath9 equals the synchrotron cooling time scale . for @xmath118 , the electron distribution will maintain a sharp low - energy cutoff at @xmath9 , while for @xmath119 , a -2 low - energy power law will develop . in order to investigate whether our choice of @xmath120 has a significant impact on our results ,",
    "we have done test simulations with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "we find all relevant aspects  the time - averaged spectra , the monoenergetic light curves , and the spectral hysteresis curves  to be virtually independent of @xmath116 within reasonable bounds .",
    "in the previous subsections , we have discussed the impact of various parameters on the broadband sed and the x - ray variability characteristics of models for intermediate and low - frequency peaked bl  lac objects .",
    "there are still a few more parameters left which we have fixed in our suite of test simulations .",
    "in particular , the choice of the cutoffs of the electron distribution , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the magnetic - field equipartition parameter @xmath21 , the doppler factor @xmath123 , and the size of the emitting region , @xmath7 , may have an impact on the spectral variability characteristics .",
    "however , those parameters can generally be constrained rather well through the observed overall spectral characteristics , and through variability time scale considerations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the values adopted here are representative for typical lbls like bl  lacertae @xcite or w  comae @xcite .",
    "furthermore , significantly different values of @xmath10 , @xmath21 , and @xmath123 would shift the synchrotron cutoff out of the x - ray regime so that the diagnostics developed here may not be applicable to the x - ray variability of bl  lac objects , which is the focus of this paper .",
    "we have presented a detailed parameter study of the time - dependent electron injection and kinematics and the self - consistent radiation transport in jets of intermediate and low - frequency peaked bl  lac objects .",
    "those objects are currently of great interest as the steadily improving capabilities of current and future air erenkov detector facilities might allow the detection of this class of blazars at multi - gev energies in the near future .",
    "at the same time , some of these objects exhibit interesting x - ray variability features which can now be studied in detail with the new generation of x - ray telescopes , in particular _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. furthermore , the glast mission , scheduled for launch in 2006 , is expected to detect many more bl  lac objects at multi - mev  gev energies and bridge the observational gap between the energy ranges previously covered by the egret instrument on board _ cgro _ , and the ground - based air erenkov facilities .    in our study , we have focused on the impact of various specific parameter choices and variations on the broadband seds , optical and x - ray light curves , and the spectral hysteresis phenomena previously observed in several high - frequency peaked bl  lac objects , but also expected to be observable in intermediate and low - frequency peaked bl  lacs .",
    "very important conclusions can be drawn from a comparison of our results concerning @xmath0-ray bright sources dominated by either ssc or external compton emission . for a given level of flux at gev energies , at a level comprable to or exceeding the synchrotron @xmath3 peak flux",
    ", those two scenarios should be clearly distinguishable by virtue of the x - ray variability during flaring episodes : if roughly symmetric flare time profiles at soft x - rays below the synchrotron cutoff are observed , and the local , time - resolved x - ray spectra are soft  consistent with a case with negligible @xmath0-ray emission  the @xmath0-ray emission might be dominated by external - compton emission ( see figs .",
    "[ ext_intspectra ]  [ ext_hic ] ) .",
    "however , if the x - ray time profiles show a clear sign of a very rapid rise and more gradual decay , and the time - resolved spectra are significantly harder than corresponding to a case without strong @xmath0-ray emission , we expect a strong contribution from the ssc mechanism to the @xmath0-ray emission ( see figs .",
    "[ l_inj_intspectra ]  [ l_inj_hic ] ) .",
    "most notably , this diagnostic of the @xmath0-ray emission mechanism does not require a detailed spectral measurement  which will be hard to achieve and require long integration times , even with glast  , but only a rough estimate of the gev flux .",
    "it relies primarily on x - ray variability studies , combined with the type of detailed time - dependent radiation modeling presented in this paper .",
    "we have shown that our results are not significantly impacted by the special choice of poorly determined parameters like the details ( exact duration and time profile ) of the acceleration / injection events leading to flaring activity , or the electron escape time scale parameter . consequently ,",
    "the x - ray variability of the high - frequency end of the synchrotron emission in intermediate and low - frequency peaked bl  lac objects can be used as a very robust diagnostic to unveil the nature of the high - energy emission in this type of blazars .",
