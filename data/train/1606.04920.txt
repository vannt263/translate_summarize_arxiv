    "in this paper we introduce models of macroscopic dissipative systems made of interacting particles which move stochastically in a circuit and exhibit a very surprising behavior . despite the fact that there is no external bias we see , after a transient , an apparently stationary state with a non zero current , with suitably different initial conditions we may select another state with the opposite value of the current .",
    "we speculate that on much longer times there is a `` dynamical phase transition '' with the two states alternating one after the other . to make an analogy with equilibrium phase transitions , consider the 2d ising model in a large but finite box with nearest neighbor ferromagnetic interactions . running the glauber dynamics at a temperature below the critical value",
    "we typically see long time intervals where the magnetization density has approximately the plus equilibrium value alternating via tunneling with those where it is close to the minus equilibrium value .",
    "the analogue of the equilibrium magnetization in our model is the current as we have two states with opposite values of the current .",
    "however we observe our circuit for times long but much smaller than those for tunneling so that we only see one of the two currents ( selected by the initial condition ) which then looks stationary .",
    "our analysis relies mostly on computer simulations , we have theoretical explanations but we miss a mathematical proof .    there is a huge literature on the more general question of existence of periodic motions or oscillations especially in the context of biological systems and chemical reactions , the classical reference is the book by kuramoto , @xcite .",
    "we just quote here a few examples selected with the purpose of introducing what we will be doing in this paper",
    ".    in @xcite p. tass discusses a simple system of rotators which interact attractively with each other and are subject to white noise forces . for small interactions the stationary state is homogeneous and even though each particle rotates",
    "there is no macroscopic change .",
    "however if the interaction increases the rotators form a macroscopic cluster which then moves periodically .",
    "this is a simplified model for neural activities , the angle of the rotator is related to the neuron potential and the crossing from @xmath4 to 0 is interpreted as the neuron discharging its potential ( `` firing '' ) : the appearance of a cluster causes a great potential change when the cluster crosses @xmath4 which could explain some diseases related to anomalous neuron firing .",
    "a quantum analogue of the rotator model has been studied by wilczek in @xcite where it is shown that there are ground states with a localized cluster which rotates , this phenomenon called a `` time crystal '' .",
    "comments on time crystals can be found in @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence of `` time crystals '' are presented in @xcite .",
    "time crystals in a classical ( i.e.  non quantum ) context have been considered in @xcite .    a rotators model is also considered in @xcite where an additional external force is present .",
    "the main point in the paper is to show that for a critical set of values of the parameters there is a cluster which is however blocked ( by the external force ) .",
    "however if the white noise strength is increased then the cluster starts moving and performs a periodic motion , this being a nice example of noise - induced periodicity .",
    "also in our models noise is the fuel which makes the system run .    in the above models each particle by itself",
    "rotates : the macroscopic rotations arise from a `` phase synchronization '' of the rotators .",
    "instead in the fitzhugh nagumo class of models for the firing cycles of a neuron , the appearance of periodic motions is due to a different , more intrinsic mechanism . for what follows it",
    "is convenient to consider a particular model in the class which can and will be read in a statistical mechanics language .",
    "in such a context the model is defined by two ( macroscopic ) variables , the magnetization @xmath5 and the magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath5 is the `` fast '' and @xmath6 the `` slow variable '' as the evolution is defined by the equations : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the `` small parameter '' and @xmath9 the inverse temperature .",
    "it can be seen that has a ( stable ) periodic solution which in the limit @xmath10 becomes the hysteresis cycle : @xmath11 , @xmath12 the positive solution of @xmath13 which exists for @xmath14 , @xmath15 ; @xmath16 , @xmath17 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the transition from the upper curve @xmath18 to the lower one @xmath19 ( and viceversa ) is discontinuous and hence very sharp for @xmath8 small , a fact which catches the main feature of the neuron voltage cycle namely that at the firing the potential changes very abruptly .",
    "observe that @xmath20 is metastable for @xmath21 as well as @xmath22 for @xmath23 , the metastable values of the magnetization will play a fundamental role also in this paper .",
    "dai pra et al . , @xcite , derived similar patterns in a macroscopic limit from a ising spin model with mean field interactions giving nice examples of `` intrinsic '' periodic oscillations in the stochastic ising model . in this paper",
    "we will consider the relaxed version of mean field as defined by kac potentials .",
    "all the above examples can be interpreted in terms of a current in a circuit but in all of them there is a more or less hidden bias because the current can flow only in one direction and not in the opposite one , so that they do not fit in what we are looking for .",
    "however they have all a common feature with our models , namely the presence of a phase transition , responsible in the rotator models for the formation of a cluster and in the fitzhugh nagumo models for the presence of a hysteresis cycle .",
    "the way phase transitions appear in our analysis is the following . in a first order phase transition",
    "there is a spontaneous separation of phases which gives rise to gradients of the order parameter without currents being present .",
    "the fourier law associates to a gradient a current ( in the opposite direction ) so that the phase transition generates `` effective forces '' which prevent the gradients to give rise to currents .",
    "our idea is to exploit such forces to construct a `` battery '' which allows for a non zero current in a circuit .",
    "our battery is a cellular automaton which simulates the kawasaki dynamics in a lattice gas with interactions given by an attractive kac potential which in the lebowitz - penrose limit has a van der waals phase transition .",
    "therefore we can distinguish between stable , metastable and unstable values of the density .",
    "the main and somehow unexpected feature of the system is that if we connect the endpoints of the channel to `` infinite '' ( i.e.  true ) reservoirs which fix the density at values @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 metastable densities we observe numerically a current which goes through the channel from the reservoir with smaller density @xmath27 to the one with the larger density @xmath28 .",
    "we have a theoretical explanation of the phenomenon in terms of properties of the solution of an integral equation obtained from the process in the `` mesoscopic limit '' where the scaling parameter @xmath29 of the kac potential vanishes , but we could verify these properties only numerically .    in @xcite we have presented numerical evidence that the current in the ca flows from the reservoir with smaller density to the one with larger density .",
    "in this paper we present a more complete set of simulations from where a very complex structure emerges for which we have a theoretical explanation , but we miss a complete mathematical proof . the other main point in this paper",
    "is that we can exploit the above to construct a circuit with a self sustained current without an external bias , as claimed in the first sentence of this introduction .",
    "this is obtained by making the reservoirs finite and allowing also particles exchanges among the reservoirs .",
    "we show ( via the simulations ) that for suitable values of the parameters there are initial conditions which give rise to a steady non zero current ( stationary for the times of our simulations ) ; there are also other initial conditions where the current flows in the opposite direction and still others where there is no current at all .",
    "the state with zero current seems unstable while those with a non zero current seem locally stable .    as suggested by a referee ,",
    "similar phenomena have also been studied in other models , e.g. the bunimovich s mushroom billiard model @xcite in which the presence of peculiar transport regimes can be traced back to the lack of ergodicity of the microscopic dynamics ; but we have not yet explored this issue . + the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec.j1 ]",
    "we define two different versions of the ca used in the simulations , namely : one describing a single ( open ) channel in contact with two reservoirs ( hereafter called os - ca ) , and another mimicking the particle dynamics in a closed circuit ( called cc - ca ) .",
    "+ in section [ sec.j1.4 ] we present the results of the simulations obtained by running the os - ca and also explain how to run the cc - ca by exploiting the results first obtained with the os - ca .",
    "+ in section [ sec.j1.1 ] we illustrate the behavior of the particle current in the cc - ca and comment on the dependence of this quantity on the parameters of the model . + in section [ sec.j1.3 ]",
    "we study the continuum ( mesoscopic ) limits of both the os - ca and the cc - ca , which are described by an integro - differential equation ; proofs are deferred to the appendix [ a1 ] . + in section [ sec.j1.5 ]",
    "we discuss the adiabatic limit of the model , and check the consistency of our simulations of the cc - ca with the predicted adiabatic behavior .",
    "+ in section [ sec6 ] we consider the case where the reservoirs have stable densities and in section [ sec7 ] where the densities are not stable .",
    "+ in section [ sec.j9 ] we study the stability of a stationary density profile , referred to below as _ the `` bump '' solution _ , close to the boundary . + concluding remarks are finally drawn in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section we define two cellular automata : the first one , called `` open system cellular automaton '' , os - ca in short , has been first introduced in @xcite and then used in @xcite to simulate a system in contact with reservoirs .",
    "the second one , simply called `` closed circuit cellular automaton '' , cc - ca , is a modification of the first one obtained by making finite the reservoirs and adding direct exchanges between them , so that it simulates a closed circuit .    * the os - ca . *",
    "the os - ca describes the evolution of particles in a  channel \" @xmath30 , @xmath31 a positive integer .",
    "besides moving in the channel particles may also leave from or enter into the channel through @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( we then say that they are absorbed or released from the reservoir @xmath3 if this happens at @xmath32 and from reservoir @xmath2 if it happens at @xmath33 ) .",
    "the two reservoirs are  infinite \" in the sense that they do not have memory of the particles which are absorbed or released .",
    "the ca in the channel is a parallel updating version of a weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process , designed for computer simulations .",
    "the @xmath34 symmetric simple exclusion process is a system of random walks jumping to the right and left with equal probability , the jump being suppressed if the arrival site is occupied .",
    "the weak asymmetry that we add is a small bias to jump in the direction where the density is higher .",
    "if the channel was a torus this would produce a phase separation into a region where the density is higher and another where it is smaller .",
    "but our channel is open as particles may leave or enter into the channel in a setup typical of the fourier law but in a context where phase transitions are present .",
    "let us now go back to the definition of the ca .",
    "the phase space is @xmath35 , particles configurations are functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 denotes the occupation variable at @xmath38 and @xmath39 will be interpreted as a velocity .",
    "@xmath40 denotes the total number of particles at @xmath41 .",
    "we may add a suffix @xmath42 when the occupation variables are computed at time @xmath42 .",
    "the definition of the os - ca involves four more parameters : @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 $ ] . in the simulations presented in this paper we have fixed @xmath46 , @xmath47 , while the length of the channel is set equal to @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath26 are referred to as the density of reservoir @xmath3 , respectively @xmath2 , they are fixed during a simulation but they may be changed in different simulations . in the definition of the ca",
    "we will use the notation @xmath49\\ ] ] where @xmath50 if @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 if @xmath53 ; similarly @xmath54 if @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath55 if @xmath56 .",
    "we want @xmath57 to be the total number of particles to the right of @xmath41 within distance @xmath58 from @xmath41 , however it may happen that if @xmath41 is close to the right boundary then there are not @xmath58 sites in the channel to the right of @xmath41 .",
    "suppose that there are only @xmath59 such sites , we then add fictitiously @xmath60 phase points @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 takes @xmath5 values to be thought as @xmath5 physical sites to the right of the channel .",
    "the occupation number @xmath64 is then set equal to @xmath28 so that the contribution to @xmath57 of the extra @xmath5 sites is @xmath65 , which explains the factor 2 in the definition of @xmath66 .",
    "analogous interpretation applies to @xmath67 .",
    "we are now ready to define how the os - ca operates : the unit time step updating ( from @xmath42 to @xmath68 ) is obtained as the result of three successive operations , we denote by @xmath69 the configuration at time @xmath42 , by @xmath70 and @xmath71 two consecutive updates starting from @xmath69 and by @xmath72 the final update which gives the configuration at time @xmath68 .    1 .   _",

    "we denote by @xmath70 the occupation numbers after the flip .",
    "advection_. after deleting the particles in the channel at @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( if present ) we let each one of the remaining particles in the channel move by one lattice step in the direction of its velocity .",

    "unlike in the os - ca now the total number of particles ( i.e.  those in the channel and in the reservoirs ) is constant in time . in the cc - ca the densities @xmath26 in the two reservoirs are no longer constant but given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 where @xmath93",

    "as already mentioned the os - ca simulates the typical fourier law experiments therefore the physically most relevant quantity is the stationary current @xmath152 : @xmath153 plays the role of the equation of state in a non equilibrium context ( due to the presence of the reservoirs ) and defines the `` non equilibrium thermodynamics '' of the system .",
    "thus our first task is to consider the currents in the ca , since the instantaneous currents defined in are strongly fluctuating , we take averages : @xmath154 in general with @xmath155 we will denote the average of @xmath156 , thus @xmath157 is the averaged current from the channel to @xmath3 .    strictly speaking stationarity is reached as @xmath158 , existence of the limit should follow ( almost everywhere ) from the birkhoff theorem .",

    "we see significant fluctuations around the linear slope @xmath185 , while for @xmath186 $ ] the fluctuations are `` negligible '' .",
    "the most striking feature in the simulations is undoubtedly the fact that the current is positive when @xmath176 so that it flows along the gradient going from the reservoir with smaller magnetization to the one with larger magnetization .",

    "* a heuristic argument .",
    "* let us now imagine to have two channels connected to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , channel 1 is the channel considered so far while channel 2 is some other channel where the fourier law is satisfied ( for instance the os - ca with no bias , @xmath187 , or some simpler connection as the one discussed later ) .",

    "this will go forever because the reservoirs in the os - ca are not changed by what comes and goes ; if instead the reservoirs were realized by large but finite systems ( as in cc - ca ) then after a time which depends on the size of the reservoirs and the difference @xmath192 the magnetization in the reservoirs would change and stationarity would be lost . however if we choose channel 2 so that @xmath193 there is a perfect balance so that what @xmath2 gives to @xmath3 through channel 1 comes back from channel 2 .",
    "we may thus hope that even if the reservoirs are finite ( yet sufficiently large ) this is again approximately true and that there is a non zero current which looks stationary for long times .",

    "we thus have a boundary layer which leads quite abruptly from the imposed values of the magnetization at the boundaries to some metastable value after which the magnetization pattern is smooth and the current flows opposite to the magnetization gradient in agreement with the fourier law .",
    "the strange phenomenon of the current going `` in the wrong direction '' depends on the fact that the magnetization - jump in the boundary layer is more pronounced if it starts from lower values of the magnetization .",
    "such a property , see , follows from the solution ( the bump ) of a non local equation describing the boundary layer , but its solution is obtained only numerically and we do not have a mathematical proof or even a heuristic explanation of why should hold .    we expect that also in the cahn - hilliard equation the graph of @xmath152 has a qualitatively similar shape as in fig . [ fig:2 ] , but we miss a proof .    we imagine that our results extend to more general systems with kac potentials and maybe to physical systems where a van der waals type of phase transition is present . in such cases a metastable interval is well defined and the relevant density ( or magnetization ) patterns in the bulk of the channel should have metastable values . also for short range interactions , as in the n.n .",

    "take the 2d ising model in a squared box of side @xmath32 : in the periodic case for @xmath435 large it is proved that if @xmath306 are the equilibrium magnetizations then for the canonical gibbs measure with average magnetization @xmath436 and @xmath437 small enough the phenomenon of phase separation is absent .",
