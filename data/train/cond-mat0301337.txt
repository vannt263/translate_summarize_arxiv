    "the solvation free energy determines how readily a solute can be dissolved in a given solvent fluid .",
    "this plays an important role in many chemically and biologically important processes , perhaps most notably in hydrophobic interactions in water .",
    "a significant part of the solvation free energy arises from the required expulsion of solvent molecules from the region occupied by the harshly repulsive molecular core of the solute .",
    "these very strong `` excluded volume '' interactions can significantly perturb the local density around the solute and cause simple approaches based on gradient expansions to fail .",
    "these effects can be seen most clearly in the simple model system treated in this paper .",
    "we will calculate the excess or solvation free energy associated with the insertion of a spherical cavity with radius @xmath0 into a hard sphere fluid , whose molecules have diameter @xmath1 . by definition",
    ", the centers of the solvent molecules are completely excluded from the region of the cavity , which thus acts like a hard core external field .",
    "this system has many interesting limits .",
    "when the exclusion field or cavity radius @xmath0 equals @xmath1 , then the cavity acts like another solvent particle and the solvation free energy is directly related to the chemical potential of the solvent .",
    "as the cavity radius tends to infinity it effectively turns into a hard wall and the relevant thermodynamic quantity is the surface free energy or surface tension associated with a hard wall in a hard sphere fluid . a cavity with radius @xmath2 acts like a hard core `` point solute '' of zero diameter .",
    "even shorter - ranged hard core fields or _",
    "`` tiny cavities '' _ with @xmath3 are also of interest , since the induced structure and solvation free energy of a tiny cavity can be calculated exactly .",
    "this limit can thus serve as a nontrivial check on approximate methods .",
    "the most commonly used method today for such problems is weighted density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "here one attempts to describe the free energy directly as a functional of some kind of smoothed or weighted average of the nonuniform and often rapidly varying singlet density .",
    "this has the advantage that the free energy is obtained directly and by construction the associated fluid structure ( obtained by functionally differentiating the free energy ) is consistent with the approximate free energy .",
    "however the choice of appropriate weighting functions is by no means obvious and a number of different and often highly formal schemes have been proposed .",
    "we focus instead in this paper on making direct use of structural information about the nonuniform solvent fluid to obtain the solvation free energy .",
    "we believe this allows physical intuition to play a more central role and we can take advantage of the recent development of a generally very accurate theory relating the structure of a nonuniform hard sphere fluid to the associated external field @xcite .",
    "as we will see below , the free energy can then be calculated by integration , starting from an initially known state ( e.g. , the uniform fluid ) and determining the free energy changes as the solute - solvent interaction ( the hard core external field ) is `` turned on '' , or alternatively , as the density is changed from the initial to the final state .",
    "there exist many possible routes from the initial to the final state , and we will generally refer to them as _",
    "thermodynamic pathways_. if exact results are used for the intermediate values of the structure and associated fields , then all these different pathways will give the same ( exact ) result for the free energy .",
    "in practice , of course , approximations will have to be made and the different pathways will generally yield different results .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as the `` thermodynamic inconsistency '' of structurally based methods @xcite . but this can be viewed more positively as giving one the freedom to choose particular pathways that could be relatively insensitive to the errors that exist in the structural theory , and we will try to use this flexibility to obtain the most accurate results",
    ". moreover , there is an inherent smoothing of the structural information in the integration used to obtain the free energy .",
    "the differences in free energy predicted by different pathways will also give us some indication about the overall quality of the theory .",
    "this approach generally requires the density profiles and associated fields of all the intermediate states along the various pathways , and thus a fast and accurate method for determining these quantities is crucial for computation efficiency .",
    "we will use here the generally accurate _",
    "hydrostatic linear response _",
    "( hlr ) equation @xcite proposed by katsov and weeks .",
    "a different physically motivated derivation of the hlr equation is given below .",
    "we will also examine the alternative free energy predictions that arise from a theory closely related to the hlr equation , the _ gaussian field model _ ( gfm ) developed by chandler @xcite .",
    "for a solute with a hard core the gfm proposes an approximate partition function from which the associated density response can be derived . in the particular case where a rigid cavity is inserted into a hard sphere fluid",
    ", the hlr and the gfm approaches turn out to make identical predictions for the induced structure .",
    "thus structurally based routes to the free energy involving only hard core fields will give the same results .",
    "in addition , one can use the approximate gfm partition function to evaluate the solvation free energy directly .",
    "however , as we will show later , the latter approach tends to produce less accurate results .",
    "this deficiency shows up even more strongly in the tiny cavity limit where the structural predictions of the hlr and the gfm are _ exact _ , and several pathways giving the exact free energy can be found .",
    "this illustrates the advantage of considering a variety of thermodynamic pathways that can make best use of the available structural information .",
