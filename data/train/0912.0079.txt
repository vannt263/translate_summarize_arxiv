    "the realization of long - distance quantum communication schemes should resort to the distribution of entangled states between distant locations @xcite . although photons are the optimal quantum information carriers in long - distance quantum communication as the interaction between them and environment is weaker than others , the polarization degree of freedom of photons is incident to the noise in a quantum channel .",

    "it is well known that the most important application of epps is in constructing quantum repeaters for long - distance quantum communication in a noisy channel @xcite . in order to connect the adjacent nodes",
    ", the two parties in quantum communication should first transmit their photons in a noisy channel and then connect them with quantum entanglement swapping .",
    "usually , the channel noise will degrade the entanglement of photon pairs .",
    "also , the imperfect operations will disturb the entanglement of quantum systems .",
    "now , let us start the explanation of our entanglement purification scheme by discussing an ordinary example . during a quantum - signal transmission ,",
    "polarization degree of freedom suffers from the channel noise as both the spatial degree of freedom and the frequency degree of freedom are more stable than polarization .",
    "the previous experiments showed that the polarization entanglement is quite unsuitable for transmission over distances of more than a few kilometers in an optical fiber @xcite .",
    "for example , naik _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated the ekert protocol @xcite over only a few meters @xcite .",
    "also , they observed the quantum bit error rate ( qber ) increase to 33% in the experimental implementation of the six - state protocol @xcite . for frequency coding @xcite",
    ", for example , the besancon group performed a key distribution over a 20-km single - mode optical - fiber spool .",
    "they recorded a qber@xmath8 contribution of approximately 4% , and estimated that 2% could be attributed to the transmission of the central frequency by the fabry - perot cavity @xcite .",
    "the experiment by min@xmath9 _",
    "@xcite for phase - noise measurements showed that in a realistic environment , the phase in long fibers ( several tens of km ) remains stable , which is an acceptable level for time on the order of 100@xmath10 .",
    "the phase stabilization is relevant for the quantum repeaters in installed optical fiber networks . in simon s protocol @xcite",
    ", they also performed an epp using spatial entanglement to purify polarization entanglement based on the good mode overlap on the pbs and phase stability that were achieved in previous experiments .",
    "in fact , that frequency and spatial entanglement absolutely do not suffer from the noise is only a hypothesis and is unpractical .",
    "here we only use it to show the basic principle for our entanglement purification process .",
    "we also will discuss the entanglement purification under a realistic environment .",
    "moreover , other degrees of freedom , such as time - bin , which is more robust than polarization , can also be used to implement this scheme @xcite . in the discussion section of this article",
    ", we will show that the entanglement purification essentially performs entanglement transformation between different degrees of freedom , that is , transforms robust entanglement in channel transmissions ( frequency and spatial ) into easily manipulatable entanglements ( polarization ) .    under the hypothesis mentioned previously ,",
    "the entanglement purification in the present scheme is divided into two steps , that is , purification for bit - flip errors and that for phase - flip errors .",
    "we discuss them in detail in this section as follows .",
    "after the transmission , the hyperentangled state of eq.([hyperentanglement ] ) will become a mixed one in polarization : @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the mixed part of eq.([hyperentanglement ] ) in polarization .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the four bell states for an entangled photon pair @xmath16 : @xmath17 after the transmission , the initial state becomes @xmath18 with one photon belonging to alice and the other belonging to bob . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we also let @xmath21 and @xmath22 .     and",
    "@xmath23 , respectively , and compare the results via classical communication . if their results are different , they need to perform a bit - flipping operation to correct this error .",
    "otherwise , there are no bit - flip errors .",
    "pbs : polarizing beam splitter.,width=302 ]    there are admixtures of the unwanted states @xmath24 and @xmath15 .",
    "we note that the state @xmath25 becoming @xmath26 is a bit - flip error , becoming @xmath24 is a phase - flip error , and both a bit - flip error and a phase - flip error take place when @xmath25 becomes @xmath27 . from eqs.([polarizationentanglement ] ) and ( [ totalentanglement ] ) , the original state can be seen as a probabilistic mixture of four pure states : with a probability of @xmath28 the photon pair in the state @xmath29 , with a probability of @xmath30 the pair in the state of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in @xmath33 .",
    "the whole task of purification is to correct the bit - flip and the phase - flip errors .",
    "so this scheme includes two steps , one for bit - flip error correction and the other for phase - flip error correction .",
    "the principle of our scheme for bit - flip error correction is shown in fig",
    ". 1 , where @xmath34 represents a cross - kerr nonlinear medium which will make the coherent state @xmath35 pick up a phase shift @xmath36 when it and one photon couple with the medium @xcite . we now consider the combinations @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "let us first discuss the state @xmath39 and @xmath40 obtain the same phase shift of @xmath36 , which can be detected by alice and bob with an @xmath41 homodyne measurement @xcite .",
    "finally , coupled by the two polarizing beam splitters ( pbss ) , they will emit from @xmath42 .",
    "the whole state becomes @xmath43 .",
    "following by the same principle , we can also get the state @xmath43 from @xmath6 if both alice and bob get no phase shifts . in the case of @xmath38",
    ", it never leads to the same phase - shift case .",
    "if alice gets the phase shift of @xmath36 and bob gets no phase shift , it means that the proceeding state is changed to @xmath44 . the photon which belongs to alice is in the mode of @xmath45 , and which belongs to bob is in @xmath46 .",
    "there is another case for alice and bob .",
    "that is , alice gets no phase shift and bob gets @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding state is also @xmath47 , but with the spatial modes of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    by applying our purification procedure , alice and bob",
    "can easily check the bit - flip error as they get different phase shifts with their @xmath41 homodyne measurements on their coherent beams .",
    "the spatial modes are also different , corresponding to the different collapsed states , but which can be completely determined .",
    "therefore , by classical communication , if a bit - flip error occurs , alice and bob will get rid of the bit - flip error by performing a bit - flip operation @xmath50 .",
    "next we show our protocol works for the other cases .",
    "the case of @xmath51 will get the same result with latexmath:[$|\\phi^{+}\\rangle |\\psi_{f}\\rangle    the upper modes @xmath48 and @xmath53 or in the lower modes @xmath45 and @xmath49 . for the case latexmath:[$|\\psi^{-}\\rangle",
    "|\\psi_{f}\\rangle      so far , we have been talking about a bit - flip error for the mixed state in polarization . by correcting this error ,",
    "the initial state in polarization becomes @xmath56 as we know , a phase - flip error can not be purified directly , but it can be transformed into a bit - flip error by hadamard ( h ) operations . in an optical system",
    ", it can be finished by a @xmath57-wave plate ( qwp ) . by performing the h operations on the two photons with two qwps , eq.(6 )",
    "evolves : @xmath58 that is , the initial state becomes @xmath59 it is interesting to find that the entanglement in frequency was not affected during the procedure discussed previously , but the spatial entanglement is consumed for correcting bit - flip errors .",
    "now we focus on the second step of our epp : correcting the phase - flip error . in fig . 2 , two photons in the from of eq.([statestep2 ] ) belong to alice and bob , respectively .",
    "two polarization - independent wavelength division multiplexers ( wdms ) are used to guide photons to different paths , according to their frequencies .",
    "for example , in alice s laboratory , it leads the photon in @xmath4 to the mode @xmath60 and the photon in @xmath61 to the mode @xmath62 .",
    "however , in bob s laboratory , it leads the photon in @xmath4 to the mode @xmath63 and the photon in @xmath61 to the mode @xmath64 .    from eq.([polarizationstatestep2 ] ) , it follows that the original state of the pairs can be seen as a probabilistic mixture of two pure states : with a probability of @xmath65 the photon pair is in the state @xmath66 and with a probability of @xmath67 the pair is in the state @xmath68 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath66 leads to the same phase shift for both @xmath36 and 0",
    ". they will be either in the mode @xmath69 with the state of @xmath70 or in the mode @xmath71 with the state of @xmath72 .",
    "this is the maximally entangled state we need .",
    "however , for @xmath68 , it never leads to the same phase shift .",
    "alice will get @xmath36 while bob will get 0 with the state @xmath73 in the mode @xmath74 or alice gets 0 and bob gets @xmath36 with the state @xmath75 in the mode @xmath76 .",
    "we can perform a bit - flip operation to get rid of the errors .",
    "finally , we will get the entangled state @xmath70 or @xmath72 with a deterministic spatial mode . with quantum frequency upconversion",
    ", we can erase distinguishability for frequency @xcite .",
    "now let us discuss the relationship between this entanglement purification protocol and a nonlocal bell - state analysis ( nbsa ) .",
    "a universal conclusion is that a completely local bell - state analysis with linear optics is not possible and one can get an optimal success probability of only @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "several works have shown that with additional degrees of freedom such as timing and momentum it is possible to distinguish the four bell states locally @xcite .",
    "however , compared with local bsa , nbsa can not be completed with the collective operations and they can only resort to local operation and classical communication ( locc ) . here",
    "we will show that with hyperentangled states and quantum nondemolition measurement ( qnd ) , we can also perform a complete nbsa .",
    "the difference is that we have to need another two degrees of freedom in nbsa , but only one is needed in local bsa .",
    "the initial state is a hyperentangled state with the form @xmath78 or @xmath33 .",
    "the whole protocol is the same as our epp discussed previously .",
    "the first step for nbsa is shown in fig .",
    "if alice and bob get the same phase shift , that is , if both get 0 or @xmath36 , they can decide that the photon pair should be in one of the two states @xmath79 .",
    "subsequently , they add a h operation on each photon and then make the second check of the phase shifts ( shown in fig .",
    "2 ) . if the phase shifts are still the same , the state should be @xmath80 ; otherwise , it is @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82 can be distinguished in the same way . in the first step ,",
    "if their phase shifts are different , it must be one of the two states @xmath82 .",
    "alice and bob perform a bit - flip operation on one of the photons and a h operation on each photon , which will complete the transformation @xmath83 ; otherwise , it is @xmath84 .",
    "in the previous works on entanglement purification , another entanglement of degree of freedom , such as spatial entanglement , has been used to purify the polarization entanglement of photon pairs @xcite . in simon s protocol @xcite",
    ", the spatial entanglement can be used to purify a bit - flip error . after consuming the resource of spatial entanglement , the phase - flip error has to be purified with the conventional method to repeat the same procedure @xcite . with another degree of freedom of photons",
    ", we can accomplish a deterministic entanglement purification .",
    "let us now discuss why our protocol can purify the mixed state completely . from eq.([polarizationentanglement ] ) , we know that there are two kinds of errors in the mixed state , that is , one is a bit - flip error and the other is a phase - flip error .",
    "the conventional epps @xcite are used to purify a bit - flip error .",
    "the phase - flip error can not be purified directly , but can be transformed into a bit - flip error . for the bit - flip purification , alice and bob can check whether one of the pairs has a bit - flip error . for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the error corresponds to the cross - combinations of @xmath85 . in this case",
    ", alice and bob can not pick up these corrupt states , and always keep them in the quantum systems that remain for a next purification .",
    "that is , a bit - flip error can not be purified completely .",
    "neither can a phase - flip error .",
    "they can not make the remaining ensemble reach an indeed pure state . in simon s protocol @xcite",
    ", they revealed that another kind of entanglement can also be used to purify the polarization entanglement state . in their protocol , they can correct the bit - flip error completely as the spatial entanglement state is a maximally entangled perfect pure state and is not effected by the channel noise .",
    "their protocol does not lead to the case that each two - photon pair has bit - flip errors after their purification .",
    "following the same principle , we use the frequency degree of freedom for a phase - flip error correction .",
    "also , we can use another kind of degree of freedom to complete this task if it does not suffer from the channel noise .",
    "locc can not increase the entanglement of quantum systems .",
    "therefore , the process of entanglement purification is essentially the transformation of entanglement . in the previous works @xcite",
    ", the transformation is between the same kind of entanglement , that is , polarization entanglement .",
    "so they need to consume the less - entangled pairs largely",
    ". the previous work of simon @xcite and this protocol show that entanglement can be transformed between some different degrees of freedom .",
    "we let the initial state be a hyperentangled state , and it owns three kinds of degrees of freedom . during the purification step ,",
    "we consume the entanglement in frequency and spatial degrees of freedom to get a pure polarization entangled state .",
    "thus , the whole entanglement purification process does not need to consume the photon pairs but to consume other degrees of freedom of entanglement .",
    "we have discussed our deterministic entanglement purification scheme in the case where there are two degrees of freedom that are insensitive to channel noise .",
    "we use the spatial freedom and the frequency freedom of photons as an example to describe the principle of our scheme .",
    "of course , the main experimental requirement of this scheme is the phase stability if we use the spatial entanglement and the frequency entanglement to purify the polarization entanglement .",
    "this requirement may limit the distance of the quantum communication .",
    "however , this scheme can be adapted to the case of energy - time entanglement , which would allow the two parties inquantum communication to be a father apart@xcite .",
    "now , let us discuss the present entanglement purification scheme with a practical transmission based on the spatial entanglement and the frequency entanglement .    in a practical transmission for long - distance quantum communication ,",
    "the relative phase between two different spatial modes is sensitive to path - length instabilities , which may be caused by the fiber length dispersion , or atmospheric fluctuation in a free - space transmission . in this way ,",
    "not only might part of the polarization of the hyperentangled state become a mixed state shown in eq.([polarizationentanglement ] ) , the entanglement in spatial mode may become @xmath86 after transmission . the relative phase between the different spatial modes is denoted by @xmath87 . here",
    "@xmath88 is the wave vector of the photons and @xmath89 is the path - length dispersion between the two spatial modes with @xmath90 .",
    "that is to say , the spatial entanglement will pick up a phase shift @xmath91 .",
    "approximatively , the frequency entanglement has similar features to the spatial entanglement .",
    "that is , it may become @xmath92 after transmission . here",
    "@xmath93 is the phase dispersion coming from the different frequencies .    after a practical transmission ,",
    "the initial state may become @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 with the first step for the purification of bit errors ( the same as the case where the entanglements in the spatial and the frequency degrees of freedom do not suffer from the phase fluctuation , as shown in fig .",

    "<S> meanwhile , it will be shown that this epp can be used to complete nonlocal bell - state analysis perfectly . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss this epp in a practical transmission . </S>"
