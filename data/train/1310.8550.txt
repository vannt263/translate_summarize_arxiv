    "[ [ section ] ]    macroscopic observables of equilibrium systems typically have narrow distributions characterised by gaussian fluctuations , except at a critical point . in non - equilibrium systems , by contrast , broad distributions and large fluctuations are fairly common @xcite , and can arise in a variety of systems such as self - propelled particles @xcite , granular gases @xcite , passive sliders on fluctuating interfaces @xcite and the burgers fluid @xcite .",
    "some of these systems also exhibit intermittency , which arises from extreme variations over short length or time scales , leading to the breakdown of self - similarity in space or time @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in this paper , we present an analytical study of a simple stochastic model which shows both giant number fluctuations and strong temporal intermittency in steady state .",
    "the system that we study consists of masses on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "these masses diffuse and aggregate on contact to form larger masses which also diffuse , aggregate , and so on , leading to a steady transfer of mass from smaller to larger aggregates .",
    "steady state is maintained by allowing for influx of single particles and outflux of aggregates at the boundaries .",
    "we choose boundary conditions that result in net transport of particles through the system , so there is a current in the steady state .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    we calculate analytically various static and dynamical properties of the system for both diffusive ( unbiased ) and driven ( biased ) movement of particles , and further consider two different kinds of boundary conditions for the diffusive case .",
    "these calculations establish the following results : ( i ) for diffusive movement of particles , the total mass i.e. the total number of particles in the system has a non - gaussian probability distribution and shows _ giant fluctuations _",
    "proportional to system size .",
    "( ii ) for both diffusive and driven movement , the system shows anomalous ( non self - similar ) dynamics , manifested most clearly in _ temporal intermittency _ of the total mass .",
    "intermittency , which is a typical feature of turbulent systems , is quantified in our study by calculating dynamical structure functions of the total mass , in analogy with structure functions of the velocity field in fluid turbulence @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    this model provides a simple case where anomalous scaling exponents of structure functions can be calculated analytically , a task which is generally rather difficult for most turbulent systems .",
    "moreover , unlike other turbulent systems such as the burgers fluid , the structure functions considered here are _",
    "temporal _ structure functions and are related to various dynamical correlation functions of the total mass in the system .",
    "calculation of dynamical quantities can be somewhat difficult and has been done earlier only for the case of aggregation with spatially uniform injection @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    another point of interest is the relevance of the present results to other aggregation models .",
    "the simplest of these models also show non - trivial features such as non - mean - field or fluctuation - dominated behaviour in lower dimensions @xcite , self - organised criticality in the presence of injection @xcite and turbulence - like ( multi - scaling ) properties of mass distributions @xcite .",
    "the present work demonstrates a different sort of turbulence - like behaviour in an aggregation model , which is characterised in terms of temporal intermittency of the total number of particles .",
    "it also suggests the possibility of probing intermittency in other aggregation models by measuring or calculating temporal structure functions of particle number .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    finally , this model represents a special limit of a more general model which also allows for fragmentation of single particles from aggregates @xcite .",
    "the general model was studied using numerical simulations and found to undergo a phase transition from a normal phase to an aggregation - dominated phase characterised by giant fluctuations and temporal intermittency as the fragmentation rate is decreased @xcite .",
    "the zero fragmentation limit of the general model analysed in this paper is an instructive limit , as it exhibits all the features which characterise the full aggregation - dominated phase , but is also simple enough to be analytically tractable .",
    "the analytical approach used in this paper and some of the results for the zero - fragmentation limit were briefly outlined in @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec2.1 ] we define the general model and the various limits of the model that arise on considering different types of bias and boundary conditions . section [ sec : sec2.2 ] summarises the main results of the paper and sec . [",
    "sec : sec2.3 ] contains a brief discussion of related models . in sections [ sec : sec3 ] and [ sec :",
    "sec4 ] , we present detailed calculations of static and dynamical properties for the case with diffusive movement of particles for two different boundary conditions .",
    "section [ sec : sec5 ] contains the analysis of the case with driven ( biased ) movement of particles . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec6 ] , we conclude with a discussion of some issues and open questions .",
    "we study a one - dimensional open system with diffusion and aggregation of particles in the bulk and influx and outflux at the boundaries .",
    "the model is defined as follows : let @xmath0 denote the number of particles on site @xmath1 . starting with an empty lattice of @xmath2 sites at @xmath3 ,",
    "a site @xmath1 is chosen at random , and one of the following moves occurs ( see fig .",
    "1 ) :    [ h ]    1 .   influx : a single particle of unit mass is injected at the first site ( @xmath4 ) at rate @xmath5 : @xmath6 .",
    "2 .   diffusion and aggregation : with rate @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) , the full stack on site i ( i.e. , all particles on the site collectively ) hops to site @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) and adds to the mass already there : @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "3 .   outflux of mass from boundaries : with rate @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) , the entire mass at site @xmath2 ( or site @xmath15 ) exits the system : @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    the model has been defined with general asymmetric diffusion rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 to the left and right . however , in this paper , we consider only the two extreme cases @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these correspond respectively to purely diffusive ( unbiased ) movement and purely driven ( fully biased ) movement of aggregates .",
    "the behaviour of the system with both drive and diffusion is expected to be qualitatively similar to that of the fully driven case .",
    "the other source of variation in this model comes from the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 which control the outflux of aggregates from the two boundaries . in the interest of simplicity",
    ", we consider only two special but representative scenarios : one in which outflux occurs only from site @xmath2 ( corresponding to @xmath22 ) and the other where outflux occurs from both site @xmath15 and @xmath2 at the same rate ( corresponding to @xmath23 ) .",
    "the purpose of considering these two cases is to explore the effect of having influx and outflux at the same boundary as opposed to spatially separated influx and outflux .",
    "these two variations give rise to the following three cases :    1 .",
    "diffusive movement , outflux only from right boundary : @xmath18 and @xmath22 .",
    "diffusive movement , outflux from both boundaries : @xmath18 and @xmath23 .",
    "3 .   driven movement , outflux from right boundary : @xmath19 and @xmath24 .    in all three cases",
    ", the influx is only at the left boundary .",
    "each of these cases is analysed separately in sections [ sec : sec3]-[sec : sec5 ] .",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    the outflux of aggregates of all sizes from the system boundaries allows the total number of particles in the system ( or any part of the system ) to attain a stationary i.e. time - independent distribution at long enough times .",
    "this is quite different from systems with only influx where the total number of particles keeps growing indefinitely @xcite .",
    "in fact , for our system , the total number of particles @xmath25 ( henceforth referred to as the total mass ) turns out to have interesting static and dynamical properties in the stationary state .",
    "in particular , we calculate :    1 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath26 of the total mass @xmath27 in the system in steady state .",
    "equivalently , one can specify the distribution by the moments @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   dynamical structure functions : @xmath29^{n}\\rangle \\label{eq2.1.1}\\ ] ] which monitor time correlations of the total mass @xmath30 at time @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath3 is any arbitrary time instant after the system has attained steady state .",
    "the motivation for analysing structure functions comes from studies of turbulent systems where they are used to quantify the breakdown of self - similarity due to intermittency .",
    "intermittency , here , refers to a behaviour of a system characterised by periods of quiescence ( little or no activity ) interspersed with extreme changes over very short time scales @xcite . for time scales shorter than a typical time - scale @xmath32 ( which characterises the lifetime of the largest structures in the system ) ,",
    "the statistical properties of intermittent signals are dominated by these extreme events .",
    "this is also reflected in the small @xmath31 behaviour of structure functions defined in eq . : for self - similar signals , @xmath33 scales as @xmath34 as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a constant ; structure functions of intermittent signals deviate from this scaling form .",
    "other useful measures of intermittency are the flatness @xmath37 and hyperflatness @xmath38 , defined respectively as @xcite :    @xmath39    @xmath40    note that @xmath37 is just the kurtosis ( upto an additive constant ) of the time - dependent probability distribution of @xmath41 . for intermittent signals ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 diverge as @xmath42 .",
    "we now summarise the main results derived in this paper for the static and dynamical properties of total mass @xmath27 in the three cases ( a)-(c ) :    1 .",
    "_ diffusive movement , outflux only from right boundary _",
    ": + _ statics : _ for injection rates that scale as @xmath43 with system size @xmath2 , we explicitly calculate the distribution @xmath26 and show that it has a non - gaussian tail of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 . in keeping with this",
    ", the total mass has ` giant ' root mean square ( rms ) fluctuations @xmath46 that scale as @xmath47 , implying that @xmath48 is finite even as @xmath49 .",
    "further , the mass in any part of the system also shows a similar non - gaussian distribution tail and giant rms fluctuations .",
    "+ _ dynamics : _ we calculate the structure functions @xmath33 [ defined in eq . ] for @xmath50 and find that they obey the scaling form : @xmath51 .",
    "the functions @xmath52 are proportional to @xmath53 for @xmath54 independently of @xmath55 , thus exhibiting the extreme anomalous scaling associated with strong intermittency .",
    "the flatness [ as defined in eq . ] also diverges as @xmath56 , with the divergence becoming stronger for larger @xmath2 .",
    "2 .   _ diffusive movement , outflux from both boundaries : _",
    "+ _ statics : _ in this case , we are not able to calculate the full distribution , but instead obtain various moments of the total mass and also of mass in any fraction of the lattice .",
    "this model , with @xmath57 injection rates , shows the same scaling of mass moments with @xmath2 as in case ( a ) : in particular , the rms fluctuations are giant , scaling as @xmath2 rather than @xmath58 with system size .",
    "+ _ dynamics : _ we explicitly calculate @xmath59 and show that it behaves as @xmath60 $ ] ( where @xmath61 is a numerical constant ) as @xmath56 . in this case also ,",
    "structure functions show the anomalous time - dependence associated with intermittency . however , their functional form for small @xmath31 is different from that in case ( a ) due to the presence of additional multiplicative log terms .",
    "3 .   _ driven movement , outflux from right boundary : _",
    "+ _ statics : _ in this case , the total system mass has a gaussian distribution and rms fluctuations that scale as @xmath62 .",
    "+ _ dynamics : _ we calculate dynamical structure functions @xmath33 for @xmath50 and find that at short times , @xmath63 , they scale as @xmath64 where @xmath65 as @xmath66 .",
    "thus , this system also shows strong intermittency , but at much shorter [ @xmath67 time scales than the diffusive systems .    the calculations for cases ( a ) and ( b ) are performed in the continuum approximation , wherein we replace recursion relations involving discrete lattice sites with differential equations in a continuous spatial coordinate and retain only the lowest order derivatives in the differential equations .",
    "we check that this approximation is self - consistent , and also find that the resulting expressions for various quantities are in excellent agreement with numerics for the discrete lattice . in case ( c ) , where the continuum approximation is not good , we work with exact recursion relations .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    while the calculations presented in sections [ sec : sec3]-[sec : sec5 ] are somewhat involved , the physical origin of some of these anomalous features can be understood quite simply .",
    "both large fluctuations and intermittency of the total mass have their origin in the exit of large aggregates from the system .",
    "the typical size of the exiting aggregates sets the scale of the rms fluctuations of the total mass : in the diffusive models ( a ) and ( b ) , these aggregates can be macroscopic , with average mass scaling as system size @xmath2 , thus giving rise to @xmath68 fluctuations of the total mass . in the driven case ( c ) , exiting aggregates typically have @xmath69 mass leading to @xmath58 fluctuations of the total mass .",
    "temporal intermittency is also a consequence of the sudden changes in @xmath30 due to the exit of a large aggregate .",
    "this can be seen clearly in figure [ fig2 ] which shows a typical time series @xmath30 for each of the three cases ( a)-(c ) .",
    "the intervals between large exit events sets the characteristic time scale @xmath32 which appears in the scaling of the structure functions .",
    "for the diffusive systems , this is @xmath70 while for driven systems , it is @xmath69 . for @xmath31",
    "much smaller than this characteristic time @xmath32 , higher moments of @xmath71 are dominated by the large crashes in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , giving rise to the anomalous scaling of structure functions at these time scales .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    theoretical studies of aggregation span a variety of models which may be used to address different sorts of questions . the simplest description of aggregation dynamics is provided by the mean field smoluchowski equation which describes the time evolution of the mass distribution of aggregates , ignoring spatial distributions altogether ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it provides a useful framework for studying aggregation phenomena in high dimensions .",
    "however , in low dimensions , it is important to explicitly account for the movement of aggregates in space as fluctuations are strong , leading to non mean field behaviour . in many studies ,",
    "aggregates are assumed to be point objects and the main focus is on studying the kinetics of the aggregation process and distribution of aggregate masses , both with @xcite and without influx @xcite . in some of these studies ,",
    "aggregation is treated as an @xmath72 reaction @xcite while in others , the mass of the reacting aggregates is also taken into account @xcite .",
    "below we present a more detailed discussion of some of these models and their relation to the present work .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    \\(i ) takayasu et al studied diffusion and aggregation with spatially uniform injection of particles @xcite and found that at large times , the interplay of injection and aggregation gives rise to a quasi - stationary state in which the mean mass at any site grows indefinitely , while the mass distribution of aggregates approaches a stationary form with a power law decay .",
    "in 1d , they calculated the power law exponent exactly and found that it is different from the mean field value .",
    "this quasi - stationary phase survives even if the model is generalised to allow for evaporation of single particles from aggregates , as long as the evaporation rate is less than a critical value @xcite .",
    "the model we study in the present paper is quite different in that it has _ spatially localised _ influx and outflux and constant average mass , but it too shows a broad - tailed distribution of aggregate sizes .",
    "however , this distribution is not scale free ; instead it has a characteristic width which diverges with system size @xmath2 .",
    "[ [ section-12 ] ]    \\(ii ) models of aggregation with localised injection have been studied for finite and infinite systems , and different sorts of boundaries @xcite .",
    "these models lack translational invariance and are characterised by position - dependent distributions of mass .",
    "for example , cheng et al considered diffusing and aggregating masses in an infinite system with a source of particles at the origin and explicitly calculated the steady state distribution of aggregate size as a function of distance from the source @xcite .",
    "further , they argued that in the presence of a sink , the distribution of masses exiting the system has an exponential tail which depends on system size .",
    "the present work also considers aggregation on a finite system with a source and a sink and finds that this exponential tail is universal , in that it appears in the mass distribution at all points arbitrarily far away from the sink .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    \\(iii ) in models with localised injection of particles , bias in movement of aggregates can lead to behaviour which is qualitatively different from the unbiased case .",
    "this behaviour was mentioned in @xcite , and studied in detail by jain et al in @xcite and reuveni et al in @xcite , where it was referred to as the asymmetric inclusion process .",
    "these studies analyse various mass distributions of the system and show that their spatial dependence is quite different from that in the unbiased case . in this paper",
    ", we have considered this model again ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sec5 ] ) , but have gone beyond earlier treatments by calculating time - dependent properties and demonstrating temporal intermittency .",
    "[ [ section-14 ] ]    \\(iv ) some studies have investigated the effect of outflux of large masses on aggregation by introducing models where aggregates with mass higher than some cutoff value are removed from the system @xcite .",
    "these systems typically show non - monotonic and , in some cases , even oscillatory time evolution .",
    "by contrast , the system we study in this paper does not have a fixed cutoff scale .",
    "instead , the mass of the exiting clusters follows a broad distribution with a characteristic mass scale that emerges from the interplay of the time taken to form an aggregate and the typical residence time of an aggregate in the system .",
    "[ [ section-15 ] ]    \\(v ) real space condensation @xcite has been studied in several mass exchange models with conserved total mass and periodic boundary conditions , e.g. , the zero range process and its variants @xcite and the aggregation - chipping model @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "when the total mass exceeds a critical value , the excess mass collects into a single macroscopic aggregate or ` condensate ' with a well - defined mean mass and relatively small fluctuations .",
    "the large fluctuations in the open system we study also have their origin in the presence of such a macroscopic aggregate with mean size proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "however , in our case the condensate mass itself has a broad distribution @xcite , resulting in a broad distribution of various quantities including the total mass .",
    "[ [ section-16 ] ]    \\(vi ) the model studied in this paper is a special limit of a more general model which also allows for fragmentation of single particles from aggregates at a constant rate @xcite .",
    "this system was studied numerically in @xcite and found to undergo a phase transition on varying the fragmentation rate . at fragmentation rates lower than a critical value ( determined by the injection rate )",
    ", the system shows all the features of the zero - fragmentation limit , notably , giant fluctuations and temporal intermittency of the total mass .",
    "however , the analytic approach used in this paper can not be extended to this general model with fragmentation .",
    "[ [ section-17 ] ]    \\(vii ) connaughton et al demonstrated that the takayasu model with aggregation and injection shows turbulence - like behaviour in the sense of multi - scaling of @xmath55-point mass - mass correlation functions @xcite .",
    "they calculated these @xmath55-point functions using field theoretic techniques and found that for @xmath73 , these have an anomalous dependence on mass that deviates from the prediction of a kolmogorov - like , self - similarity hypothesis .",
    "the turbulence - like behaviour that we observe in the present work is somewhat different , being related to the temporal intermittency of the total mass .",
    "it may , however , be interesting to explore whether there is a connection between these two characterisations of turbulent behaviour in the context of aggregation .",
    "[ [ section-18 ] ]    dimensionality plays an important role in aggregation phenomena .",
    "most of the models discussed above have an upper critical dimension @xmath74 , below which the system shows diffusion - limited behaviour with spatial ( anti- ) correlations between particles being strong enough to cause deviation from mean field predictions .",
    "this raises the question whether there is an upper critical dimension in the present model too , beyond which there is no intermittency .",
    "we are not able to address this question using the analysis of this paper .",
    "more generally , while several techniques for finding exact solutions of such models exist in 1d @xcite , they can not be generalised to higher dimensions .",
