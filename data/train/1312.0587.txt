    "there is a complete metric space @xmath7 with a contractive family of operators @xmath19 , such that no word in @xmath20 has a fixed point .",
    "furthermore , austin asked if this is possible in a compact space .",
    "does every contractive family of operators on a compact space have a composition with a fixed point ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that even with the additional assumption of compactness , there still need not be a fixed point .",
    "+    [ thm1 ] there is a compact metric space @xmath7 with a contractive family of operators @xmath19 , such that no word in @xmath20 has a fixed point .",
    "we remark that our construction provides the counterexample for any given @xmath10 .",
    "since our construction of the counterexample which proves the theorem  [ thm1 ] is fairly complicated , we provide some motivation for our steps .",
    "suppose that we are in the setting of theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "given any set @xmath21 of points in our space , since @xmath1 is compact , we know that @xmath21 is bounded .",
    "let @xmath22 be its diameter .",
    "then , it is not hard to show that the diameter of one of @xmath23 or @xmath24 is at most @xmath25 . to see this ,",

    "this simple observation leads us to the idea that instead of considering distances between each pair of points in the wanted space , thinking about diameters of sets should be much more convenient in our problem . with this in mind ,",
    "we develop the notion of ` diameter spaces ' , which will play a key role throughout our construction . due to their importance",
    ", we include the proper definition .",
    "+ let @xmath1 be a non - empty set .",
    "given a collection @xmath40 of subsets of @xmath1 , we call @xmath41 a _ diametrisable space _ provided the following conditions are met ,    1 .   given @xmath42 there is @xmath43 with @xmath44 2",
    ".   if @xmath45 and @xmath46 then @xmath47    we refer to elements of @xmath1 as points and elements of @xmath40 as _ diametrisable sets_. further , if a function @xmath48 is such that given @xmath45 with a nonempty intersection , we have that @xmath49 holds , we call @xmath50 the _ diameter _ and @xmath51 a _ diameter space_. we refer to this inequality as the _ triangle inequality for the diameter spaces_. + in a very natural way , one can use a diameter space to induce a pseudometric on the underlying space , by simply finding the infimum of diameters of all the diametrisable sets containing any two given distinct points .",
    "furthermore , by imposing suitable conditions on the diametrisable sets , one can get nice properties to hold for the pseudometric space .",
    "+ in order to continue further , we must first specify the underlying set .",
    "hence , let us look for the space that should , in some vague sense , be the minimal counterexample .",
    "one of the possible ways to approach this issue is to fix a point @xmath52 , and then look what other points can we obtain .",
    "it is not hard to see that completion of the set of all images that one can get by applying @xmath15 and @xmath53 to @xmath52 is itself a compact metric space , and that @xmath54 form a @xmath12-contractive map on this subspace of @xmath1 as well .",
    "now , starting from @xmath52 we must include all the points described , and ( provided we can not get to the same point in different ways ) we can actually biject all these points that are obtained using @xmath54 from @xmath52 with finite words over a two letter alphabet .",
    "therefore , our construction will start from an underlying set @xmath1 of all finite words over @xmath55 , with obvious functions @xmath54 each of which adds one of the characters to the beginning of the word given as input .",
    "then , provided we have a metric on @xmath1 , we will take its completion , and hope that the metric space that we get , along with @xmath54 satisfies all the properties of the theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "this is where diameter spaces come into play .",
    "we will describe the properties of a collection of diametrisable sets @xmath40 on @xmath1 , that guarantee the completion of the induced pseudometric space , along with @xmath54 , ( being the concatenation functions described ) , to be a counterexample .",
    "being a relatively long list , we refer the reader to the corollary  [ sumcor ] to get the idea of what conditions we impose on @xmath40 , which will in fact be a sequence of subsets of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "in this subsection we show how one can obtain a pseudometric space from diameter spaces .",
    "the following proposition tells us how to induce pseudometric on the underlying set .",
    "let @xmath57 ) be a diameter space .",
    "define a function @xmath58 by @xmath59 when @xmath26 and @xmath35 are distinct , where infimum is taken over all diametrisable set that contain points @xmath26 and @xmath35 , and @xmath60 otherwise .",
    "then @xmath61 is well - defined and @xmath62 is a pseudometric space .",
    "firstly , suppose we are given two distinct points @xmath26 and @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath21 , the set of all values that diameter of a diametrisable set containing @xmath13 can take , is non - empty , and bounded from below , so @xmath63 exists , and @xmath61 is well - defined . + to prove that @xmath61 is a pseudometric , we just need to show that the triangle inequality holds , since @xmath64 holds for all points @xmath26 and @xmath61 is symmetric by construction",
    ". therefore let @xmath65 be three points .",
    "if any of these are equal , we are done .",
    "otherwise , given @xmath66 we can find sets @xmath45 such that @xmath44 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 . but",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 intersect hence their union forms a diametrisable set , and further @xmath71 , so @xmath72 .",
    "but this holds for any positive @xmath73 proving the triangle inequality , and therefore the proposition .",
    "the pseudometric that we constructed from the diameter space will be referred to as the _ induced pseudometric _ by @xmath50 .",
    "+ remark that given any metric space @xmath62 we can construct a diameter space @xmath51 by taking diametrisable sets to be the finite subsets of @xmath1 , and the diameter function @xmath50 to have the usual meaning , that is for any @xmath43 , we set @xmath74 to be @xmath75 where maximum is taken over all pairs of points in @xmath69 . then , the metric @xmath61 coincides with the pseudometric induced by @xmath50 .",
    "thus in this way , we can consider every metric space to be a diameter space at the same time .",
    "+ in addition we note that any finite measure space is a diameter space as well .      in the previous subsection",
    "we saw how to obtain a pseudometric space from a diameter space . to construct a counterexample to the conjecture",
    ", we will use this procedure , but as the proposition only guaranties that we get a pseudometric space , we need to add additional properties of a diameter space to ensure that we reach our goal .",
    "first of all , we work with specific underlying set @xmath1 and the diameter function which are consistent with the nature ( or more precisely the geometry ) of the problem .",
    "as we are considering essentially compositions of functions applied to an element of the given metric space satisfying the assumptions of the conjecture , we will work with points of @xmath1 being finite words over the alphabet consisting of two letters @xmath76 , including the empty word .",
    "before we proceed further , let us introduce some notation . + * notation . * if @xmath77 are two words of @xmath1 , we write @xmath78 for the word obtained by writing first @xmath79 then @xmath80 .",
    "say that @xmath79 is a _ prefix _ or an _ initial segment _ of @xmath80 , if there is another word @xmath81 with @xmath82 , and if this holds write @xmath83 .",
    "the _ length _ of a word @xmath79 , denoted by @xmath84 is the number of letters in @xmath79 .",
    "characters are considered to be words of length one simultaneously as being characters .",
    "when @xmath21 is a subset of @xmath1 we write @xmath85 and @xmath86 , when @xmath87 .",
    "given a positive integer @xmath8 and word @xmath79 , write @xmath88 for @xmath89 , where @xmath79 appears @xmath8 times .",
    "the empty word is denoted by @xmath90 .",
    "finally , we allow infinite words occasionally ( although these are not elements of @xmath1 ) , and write @xmath91 to stand for the infinite word obtained by writing consecutive copies of @xmath79 infinitely many times .",
    "+ we will take our functions @xmath92 to be given by @xmath93 and @xmath94 for all words @xmath87 .",
    "then every word is actually the same as the corresponding composition of functions applied to the empty word . on the other hand ,",
    "having in mind the contraction property of the family of the functions that we want to hold , we take @xmath40 to be a sequence of subsets of @xmath1 , namely @xmath95 and set @xmath96 for some fixed @xmath10 .",
    "now , we just need to specify what needs to hold for @xmath40 so that we get a counterexample .",
    "+ let us start with ensuring that @xmath51 is a diameter space .",
    "we accomplish this by requiring the following property : + * a1 .",
    "* for any nonnegative integers @xmath97 if @xmath98 then @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "+ then we see that @xmath41 is a diametrisable space and that given any two diametrisable sets @xmath101 that intersect , we have @xmath102 or @xmath103 so the triangle inequality holds , thus this is indeed a diameter space .",
    "+ consider now @xmath62 where @xmath61 is the induced pseudometric by @xmath50 . to make @xmath61 non - degenerate ,",
    "we introduce another property : + * a2 .",
    "* each point belongs to only finitely many diametrisable sets .",
    "+ since @xmath50 is always positive , and the infimum defining @xmath104 for @xmath105 is actually minimum taken over finitely many positive values , we get that @xmath61 is nondegenerate , and thus a metric . + as far as the compactness is concerned , the fact that we can obtain a compact space from a totally bounded one by taking its completion is what motivates our following step .",
    "hence , another condition is introduced : + * a3 . * for any positive integer @xmath106 , there are integers @xmath107 greater than @xmath106 such that @xmath108 is finite .",
    "+    the completion @xmath109 of the metric space induced by @xmath51 is compact , provided @xmath40 satisfies * a1 * -*a3*.    by the comments from the above , we just need to show that @xmath62 is totally bounded .",
    "let @xmath66 be given , and choose @xmath106 for which @xmath110 holds . by * a3 * , there are @xmath111 for which the union of @xmath112 covers all but finitely many points , denoted by @xmath113 .",
    "then , each @xmath114 is contained in @xmath115 for some @xmath116 and @xmath117 , so @xmath1 is covered by finitely many open balls of radius @xmath73 , and so the metric space is totally - bounded .",
    "say that a cauchy sequence @xmath118 is proper if there is no @xmath106 with @xmath119 .",

    "firstly , we should prove that such extension of @xmath150 is well - defined .",
    "take arbitrary @xmath154 , and thus since @xmath144 is completion of @xmath26 , there must be cauchy sequence in @xmath1 whose limit is @xmath26 .",
    "but image of this sequence under @xmath150 is cauchy as well , so it has limit in @xmath144 , so we just need to show its uniqueness . therefore",

    "merging these two sequence into @xmath156 , where @xmath157 , implies that @xmath156 is cauchy , hence @xmath158 is also cauchy , so @xmath151 and @xmath159 have the same limit , as required .",
    "+ secondly , we should prove that @xmath150 is continuous in @xmath144 .",
