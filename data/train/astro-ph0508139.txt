    "recent observations by type ia supernova(sn ) survey(garnavich et al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et al . 1998 ) and cosmic microwave background(cmb ) anisotropies(de bernardis et al . 2002 , lee et al . 2001 ) strongly show the evidence for a cosmological constant or dark energy . in general case , the dark energy ( or quintessence )",
    "can have a time - dependent equation of state , @xmath6 ( wetterich 1988 , peebles & ratra 1988 ) , which is invoked to explain the coincidence problem .",
    "some researchers have reanalyzed the cosmological data from cmb , sn , large scale structure(lss ) and gravitational lens statistics(bean & melchiorri 2001 , baccigalupi et al .",
    "2001 , hannestad & mrtsell , 2002 , chae et al .",
    "2002 ) , confirming that quintessence is slightly preferred with respect to cosmological constant .",
    "an important class of quintessence models are known as tracking models . by coupling a scalar field to matter one",
    "can obtain tracking solutions ( zlatev et al . 1998 , steinhardt et al . 1999 ) for time dependence of dark energy density so that it always follows the dominant energy density component and fairly independent of initial conditions .",
    "recently malquarti & liddle(2002 ) used stochastic inflation formalism to constrain the initial values of quintessence after inflation .",
    "they have shown that for inverse power - law form of quintessence @xmath2 satisfying current observations , initial @xmath7 was so large that it could not enter tracking regime until the matter - domination epoch .",
    "this has put the tracking behavior in considerable jeopardy for such quintessence models .    in the present paper",
    ", we will study the behaviors of several quintessence models which are singular at @xmath0(dubbed `` small - field quintessence models '' ) affected by inflation .",
    "quintessence being almost massless , one has @xmath8 ( see liddle et al 1993 for details ) after inflation .",
    "the simplest constraint on initial @xmath7 is that its value should be larger than the perturbative part : @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "we shall use this constraint to see when they enter tracking regime , disregarding the details of inflation . in the following section",
    ", we will discuss the tracking behaviors of three quintessence models : inverse power - law potential @xmath2 ( ratra & peebles 1988 ) , the supergravity model @xmath11 and the exponential form of inverse power - law potential @xmath12 .",
    "we shall consider models of quintessence in a flat cosmological background , i.e. @xmath13 . the ratio of energy density to the critical density today is @xmath14 for the @xmath7-field and @xmath15 for the matter density where @xmath16 .",
    "we also define a background equation - of - state @xmath17 , @xmath18 in radiation - dominated epoch and 0 in matter - dominated era .",
    "we use dimensionless units where the planck mass is m@xmath191 .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath7-field is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath23 is the robertson - walker scale factor , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the matter and radiation energy density respectively . early in the radiation - dominated epoch , we have @xmath27 and substituting the form of @xmath28 into eq.(1 ) : @xmath29 assuming @xmath30 to be a constant , we can easily obtain the solution of the equation:@xmath31 , where c is a constant .",
    "so we have @xmath32 the above equation gives the rough evolution of @xmath7-field .",
    "on the other hand we can obtain the @xmath7 energy density in another method . according to the present cosmological density @xmath33 ,",
    "we can write @xmath34 or @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the redshift , the subscript eq denotes the epoch of matter - radiation equality , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the equations of state of q - field during matter- and radiation - domination epochs .",
    "note in the analytical formula eqs.(5,6 ) we ve assumed @xmath37 to be a constant and today is matter - dominant , this has led to considerably uncertainties when compared to the exact numerical case ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "an important function is @xmath39 , whose properties determine whether tracking solutions exist . taking the derivative of the equation - of - motion with respect to @xmath7 and combining with the equation - of - motion itself , we can obtain the tracking equation : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    in the following sections",
    ", we will discuss the tracking behavior of different quintessence models in detail .",
    "and we take the cosmological parameters derived from recent observational constraints throughout , @xmath43 and the hubble constant @xmath44 .",
    "the quintessence models of the pure inverse power - law potentials , as originally introduced by ratra & peebles ( 1988 ) : @xmath2 . for the tracking solution , @xmath45 then @xmath46 . since @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 , according to eq .",
    "( 6 ) , we have @xmath51    for @xmath52 , we then have @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 . taking the approximation @xmath55 , we can obtain the final analytical form : @xmath56    we have also computed the tracking behavior of the quintessence models numerically according to eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . in fig .",
    "1 , the dashed ( @xmath57 ) and dotted ( @xmath58 ) lines show the evolution of @xmath7-field with the different values of @xmath59 .",
    "we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 today . for a smaller @xmath59",
    ", @xmath7 would be smaller earlier in the tracking regime , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "our fit with @xmath43 requires @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in malquarti & liddle(2002 ) ,",
    "their fitting gives @xmath64(68% confidence ) , our result is in agreement with theirs .      in this section",
    "we consider the supergravity version of model considered previously with a superpotential of the form @xmath65 .",
    "we take the potential form @xmath11 ( brax et al 2000 ) , where @xmath66 , and study its tracking behavior .    for tracking solutions",
    ", we have @xmath67 because @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "it is similar with former inverse power - law potentials . for @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    "are expected .    in fig .",
    "1 , the solid line shows the @xmath7-field evolution with the redshift . and in fig .",
    "2 , we also show the evolution of the equation - of - state @xmath30 in both the inverse power - law and the supergravity potentials , taking the same parameter @xmath72 . in the early radiation - dominant epoch",
    ", they have the same equation of state , while later when matter and quintessence dominate , @xmath7 grows larger and the factor @xmath74 takes effect today in the supergravity model , which makes the main contribution to the different behaviors of the two models today . the pure inverse power law form @xmath75",
    "is ruled out for it predicts @xmath76 and can not give an accelerating universe today , meanwhile @xmath77 is still not excluded . in the two models",
    ", we have given the analytical forms for the tracking behavior according the eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ; we have also compared the results of analytical and numerical calculations in the supergravity version in fig.3 .      here , we further consider another kind of inverse power - law potential with the form like @xmath78 . in our case , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "however , since the equation - of - state of the model @xmath30 varies with @xmath81 , it is relatively difficult to obtain the analytical solutions . in fig .",
    "4 we have shown the evolution of the @xmath7-field and the equation - of - state @xmath30 by numerical calculations , the tracking behavior is different from the previous two models discussed above .",
    "the evolution curve of @xmath7 -field always rises with time .",
    "we are able to give some rough estimations since @xmath82 is also satisfied for large @xmath36 .",
    "the form @xmath83 can be expanded to @xmath84 series with @xmath85 , hence @xmath86 .",
    "its early behavior of @xmath7 and @xmath87 can also be explained as @xmath88 , where @xmath7 would be much larger than in the pure inverse power - law models from above analysis .    for the comparison of the three models , we consider the very early behavior of @xmath7-field . in the very early time , the three models take the same form @xmath89 , with @xmath58 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .    in fig . 5 , we show our constraints on the tracking behavior of the quintessence models by taking the initial condition @xmath92 , where @xmath93 .",
    "we take @xmath94 initially .",
    "we do not include the exponential form of inverse power - law model because we have no constraints on it , as can be seen from fig.4 .",
    "the solid line displays the evolution of @xmath7-field in the supergravity model , while the dashed line denotes the inverse power - law model . for @xmath2",
    ", it can only enter tracking regime after @xmath95 .",
    "for the supergravity model @xmath11 , it requires @xmath96 .",
    "we have analyzed the dynamical evolution and tracking solutions of three quintessence models .",
    "we used a simple constraint @xmath97 to study the tracking behaviors , and found that it can also give a strong constraint on the pure inverse power - law model which enters tracking regime at a late stage @xmath3 .",
    "the key fact is that for such a pure inverse power - law model , @xmath59 has to be very small in order to fit current observations . while for the supergravity model and exponential form of inverse power - law model , the exponential form takes a positive effect , rendering them have @xmath98 today and satisfy the cmb and sn constraints , meanwhile they take the pure inverse power - law form with much larger @xmath59 and hence little constraint is exhibited with @xmath99 when entering the tracking regime .    the typical tracking behavior of inverse power - law model begins only at quite a late stage of evolution , well after nucleosynthesis and possibly after decoupling too as presented by this paper and malquarti & liddle .",
    "tracking is the key to solve the coincidence problem , tracking quintessence would lose the significance if it has to enter tracking regime extremely late .",
    "therefore , the supergravity and exponential form of inverse power law model models show better tracking behaviors in our analysis .",
    "we are grateful to mingzhe li , xiulian wang , de - hai zhang , xinmin zhang and yongheng zhao for helpful discussions .",
