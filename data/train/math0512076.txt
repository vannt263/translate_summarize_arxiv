    "it has been known for some time @xcite that two - dimensional _ topological _ field theories are the same as finite - dimensional commutative frobenius algebras over a field @xmath0 .",
    "this correspondence can be extended to so - called open / closed topological field theories @xcite ; the frobenius algebra is then no longer , in general , commutative .",
    "it has also been known for some time @xcite that a subclass of such theories , so called lattice topological field theories , can be constructed from a separable non - commutative frobenius algebra @xmath1 . in this case , the commutative frobenius algebra just mentioned is the centre of @xmath1 , and only the morita class of @xmath1 matters .",
    "intriguingly , an analogous relationship holds in the much more involved situation of two - dimensional _ conformal _ field theory @xcite : the relevant structure is now ( a morita class of ) a symmetric special frobenius algebra in a braided monoidal category .",
    "it is this latter relation that is further investigated in this article .",
    "the appearance of frobenius algebras in two - dimensional conformal field theory ( in _ cft _",
    ", for short ) is based on the remarkable fact that the problem of constructing a cft can be separated into a `` complex - analytic '' and an `` algebraic '' part . here",
    "we are mainly concerned with the algebraic part .",
    "we formulate it ( in section [ sec : algebra ] ) as problem [ prob : lem ] , and show in theorem [ thm : solve ] that indeed a symmetric special frobenius algebra provides a solution .",
    "the purpose of section [ sec : motivate ] is to motivate problem [ prob : lem ] and to explain how it relates to other aspects of cft .",
    "accordingly , sections [ sec : what][sec : open - closed ] contain a brief outline of cft .",
    "the relation between the complex - analytic and the algebraic aspects relies on a number of physical ideas which so far have only partially been cast into a precise mathematical language .",
    "if , however , one accepts those ideas , then solving problem [ prob : lem ] amounts to the construction of a cft with a prescribed rational conformal vertex algebra as its chiral symmetry .",
    "two - dimensional conformal field theory has its origins in several areas of physics . in all of these",
    "it arises as an effective theory , that is , it applies to experiments once a suitable limit is taken , like the limit of large system size or of low energy .",
    "for example , the long range behaviour of two - dimensional statistical systems at equilibrium @xcite is described by a ( full , local ) cft , and the properties of edge states in quantum hall systems ( see e.g   @xcite ) by chiral conformal field theories .",
    "cft is also a basic ingredient in string theory , which is a candidate for a fundamental theory of matter and gravity @xcite .",
    "however , string theory is not yet sufficiently well understood to unambiguously reproduce or contradict known experimental results . in this sense",
    "the only established appearance of cft in physics to date is via effective theories .",
    "nonetheless the strongest incentive for the mathematical development of cft came from its applications to string theory .",
    "there are several versions of two - dimensional cft , such as formulations in terms of nets of von neumann algebras on two - dimensional minkowski space ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , or in terms of correlation functions in the euclidean plane ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the formulation of cft that will be reviewed below has been developed to fit the needs of string theory @xcite .",
    "it has been cast in a more axiomatic language in @xcite ; some recent treatments are @xcite .    in this",
    "setting , a cft is based on two pieces of data : first , a @xmath2-graded complex vector space @xmath3 with finite - dimensional homogeneous subspaces @xmath4 ( `` the @xmath5th energy eigenspace in @xmath3 '' ) .",
    "@xmath3 is called the _ space of states _ of the cft . by @xmath6",
    "we denote the graded dual of @xmath3 . assuming",
    "the existence of a discrete grading is actually a simplification ; there are examples of cfts which lack such a grading , most importantly liouville theory @xcite . a more appropriate name for the class of theories we study here might thus be _ compact _ cfts .",
    "also , in the light of the open / closed cft that will be considered in section [ sec : open - closed ] below , what we are discussing is full ( as opposed to chiral , see section [ sec : chiral - full ] below ) _ closed _ cft , and accordingly @xmath3 is the space of closed cft states .    to describe the second piece of data we need the notion of a _",
    "world sheet_. a world sheet  is a smooth , compact two - manifold with parametrised and labelled boundary components and a riemannian metric ; in this paper we also require that  is oriented .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig : closed - example ] .",
    "the components of the boundary @xmath7 are either ` incoming ' or ` outgoing ' .",
    "we number the components in the two subclasses separately , and denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 the number of incoming and outgoing components of @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "further , every incoming boundary component is parametrised by an embedding @xmath10 of a small annulus @xmath11 , which is is required to be conformal and orientation preserving .",
    "similarly , outgoing boundary components are parametrised by embeddings @xmath12 of a small annulus @xmath13 .",
    "two world sheets  and @xmath14 are _ isomorphic _ iff there exists an isometry which is compatible with the boundary labelling and parametrisations .",

    "correlator _ for .",
    "the assignment @xmath20 has to fulfil a number of consistency requirements . to formulate them",
    "we need the notion of _ cutting a world sheet along a curve_. more precisely , let  be a world sheet , @xmath25 a small annulus , and @xmath26 a conformal orientation preserving embedding",
    ". then the world sheet @xmath27 is defined by cutting along the image of the unit circle , which results in one additional incoming and one additional outgoing boundary component .",
    "for example , from the world sheet  in figure [ fig : closed - example]a ) one can obtain the world sheet @xmath27 shown in figure [ fig : closed - example]b ) .",
    "thus the correlator of @xmath27 is a multilinear map ( cut_f ( ) ) : h h h^h^h^. we also define a partial evaluation ( or ` trace ' ) operation @xmath28 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 as evaluation of the last out- on the last in - component . and then takes the limit @xmath31 .",

    "the number @xmath43 appearing here is called the _ central charge _ of the cft .",
    "a class of examples for closed cfts is provided by two - dimensional topological field theories @xcite ; detailed expositions can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath44 be a finite - dimensional commutative frobenius algebra over @xmath45 .",
    "then a cft in the sense described above is obtained upon setting @xmath46 and constructing @xmath20 by cutting a world sheet into elementary building blocks on which @xmath20 is defined in terms of the defining data of @xmath44 .",
    "for example , consider the world sheets @xmath47 the associated correlators @xmath48 and @xmath49 are then defined in terms of the multiplication @xmath50 of @xmath44 , and by the unit @xmath51 of @xmath44 ( via the map @xmath52 from @xmath45 to @xmath44 ) , respectively .",
    "the pair @xmath53 obeys condition * ( c2 ) * , with @xmath54 , for the trivial reason that @xmath20 does not depend on the metric at all .",
    "independence of the world sheet metric also explains the name _ topological _ field theory . that @xmath44 and @xmath20 obey * ( c1 )",
    "* follows from , and is indeed equivalent to , the defining properties of the commutative frobenius algebra @xmath44 ; this result is due to @xcite and @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the point of view from which open / closed cft is described below is again inspired by string theory , namely from models that include both closed strings , which are circles , and open strings , which are intervals @xcite .",
    "in the physics literature , the study of open / closed cft reaches back to @xcite .",
    "the presentation below is in the spirit of the one given in section [ sec : what ] ; other mathematical approaches along similar lines have recently been developed in @xcite .",
    "an open / closed cft is defined similarly to section [ sec : what ] , but for a wider class of world sheets .",
    "namely , the manifolds are now allowed to have corners , for example    ( 200,141)(0,0 ) ( 40,5 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 18,-7)c - in@xmath55 ( 85,-3)o - in@xmath55 ( 115,-3)o - in@xmath56 ( 20,128)o - out@xmath55 ( 85,132)c - out@xmath56    [ eq : oc - world ] in particular there are now three kinds of boundaries , to which we will refer as _ closed state boundaries _ , _ open state boundaries _ , and _ physical _ ( or _ external _ ) _ boundaries _ , respectively . closed state boundaries occurred already in closed cft in section [ sec : what ] .",
    "they are circles with a parametrised neighbourhood , and they are labelled either as incoming or as outgoing and are numbered .",
    "open state boundaries",
    "are intervals that lie between two corners ; they , too , are labelled either as incoming or as outgoing and are numbered .",
    "in addition they are parametrised by a ( conformal , orientation and boundary preserving ) embedding of a small half - annulus @xmath57 for incoming boundaries and @xmath58 for outgoing boundaries , with @xmath59 the upper half plane .",
    "for example , @xmath60 physical boundaries are not labelled and not parametrised .",
    "they are either circles or intervals between two corners . at each corner ,",
    "a physical and an open state boundary meet .",
    "two open / closed world sheets are isomorphic if they are isometric in a way compatible with labelling and parametrisation .    the basic data for an open / closed cft are two graded @xmath2-graded vector spaces @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( with  homogeneous subspaces ) and a mapping @xmath20 , called again correlator or amplitude , that assigns to an isomorphism class of open / closed world sheets a multilinear map .",
    "for example , to the world sheet a multilinear map ( ) : h_cl h_op h_op h_cl^h_op^ [ eq : corr - as - map ] is assigned .",
    "the conditions for the triple @xmath63 to define an open / closed cft are the same as * ( c1 ) * and * ( c2 ) * in section [ sec : what ] , except that now there are two distinct ways of cutting a surface .",
    "one can either embed a small annulus @xmath64 , in which case cutting along the image of the unit circle results in two new closed state boundaries , or one can embed a small half - annulus @xmath65 , so that cutting along the image of the unit half - circle results in two new open state boundaries .",
    "the dashed lines in show two possible cutting paths .",
    "as there are now two distinct cutting procedures , there are also two partial trace operations @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; the former is the evaluation for the last pair of @xmath61 and @xmath68 , while the latter is the one for the last pair of @xmath62 and @xmath69 . condition * ( c1 ) * is imposed with respect to each of these two operations .",
    "again , two - dimensional topological field theory provides examples for such a structure . in this particular class of theories ,",
    "one considers a finite - dimensional symmetric special frobenius algebra @xmath1 over , and obtains an open / closed cft with @xmath70 ; the results of @xcite take a particularly simple form in this case , and one finds @xmath71 , the centre of @xmath1 .",
    "open / closed 2-dtft has been studied in @xcite and in the detailed work @xcite .",
    "as before , the correlators @xmath20 are constructed by decomposing world sheets into simple building blocks ; we refrain from going into any more detail here .",
    "again , the open / closed cft obtained in this way does not depend on the world sheet metric .    as we will see in section",
    "[ sec : algebra ] , by considering a symmetric special frobenius algebra not in the category @xmath72 of finite - dimensional complex vector spaces , but rather in a more general braided monoidal category , we are able to describe also open / closed cfts that are not topological .",
    "one way to achieve a construction of open / closed cft is to proceed in two steps .",
    "as far as the correlators are concerned , the first step may be stated as    * `` _ find all possible functions consistent with a given symmetry _",
    ", ''    while the second step can be summarised as    * ``",
    "_ among all functions with the correct symmetry , find the correlators_. ''    this approach has proven particularly powerful in what is known ( see below ) as _ rational _ cft ; it has its roots in @xcite .",
    "let us describe the basic ingredients of this approach .",
    "the symmetries of a cft can be described by a conformal vertex algebra @xmath73 . to a tuple @xmath74 of @xmath73-modules and",
    "a complex curve @xmath75 with @xmath76 marked points one can associate a vector space @xmath77 of _ conformal blocks _ , which is a subspace of the space of multilinear maps from @xmath78 to @xmath45 .",
    "this subspace can be constructed explicitly as the space of invariants in the algebraic dual of the algebraic tensor product @xmath79 with respect to the dual of the action of @xmath73 on this tensor product .",
    "is the vertex algebra associated with an untwisted affine lie algebra @xmath80 , the action of @xmath73 on @xmath81 is through the lie algebra @xmath82 , with @xmath83",
    "the finite - dimensional simple lie algebra underlying @xmath80 and @xmath84 the associative algebra of meromorphic functions on @xmath75 that have at most finite order poles at the marked points and are holomorphic everywhere else @xcite .",
    "details for the general case can be found in @xcite . ] for a fixed @xmath76-tuple @xmath74 and fixed genus @xmath36 of @xmath75 the spaces @xmath77 of conformal blocks form a vector bundle @xmath85 over the moduli space @xmath86 of complex curves of genus @xmath36 with @xmath76 marked points .",
    "each such bundle of conformal blocks is equipped with a projectively flat connection .",
    "cft on complex curves , with the associated system of bundles of conformal blocks , is called _ chiral _ cft .",
    "step 1 in the construction of a _ full _ cft , i.e.  of an open / closed cft in the sense of section [ sec : open - closed ] , consists in determining the corresponding chiral cft .",
    "the chiral cft does not fix the correlators uniquely , but it does determine , for each world sheet @xmath87 , a subspace v ( ) ( h_cl h_op^)^ * [ eq : cft - v(x ) ] to which the correlator must belong .",
    "this subspace @xmath88 is given as a space of conformal blocks .",
    "the relevant surface is , however , not the world sheet   itself ( which e.g.  may have a non - empty boundary ) , but rather its complex double , which is a complex curve , having two marked points for each bulk insertion and one marked point for each boundary insertion ( see section [ sec : x - v(x ) ] for the topological analogue of the complex double ) .",
    "@xmath88 is the space of conformal blocks on @xmath89 .",
    "that bulk insertions result in two marked points while each boundary insertion only leads to one marked point is in accordance with the fact that one finds an action of @xmath90 on @xmath61 and an action of @xmath73 on @xmath62 .",
    "the symmetries of the cft , as encoded in the conformal vertex algebra @xmath73 , force the correlator @xmath24 of the full cft to be an element of the space @xmath88 , ( ) v ( ) .",
    "[ eq : corr - in - blocks ] in quantum field theoretic terms , the symmetries give rise to partial differential equations , known as chiral ward identities , that must be obeyed by the correlators ; they can be formulated as the condition on the sections of the bundles @xmath91 to be covariantly constant .    in step 2 of the procedure one constructs a full cft from the chiral cft obtained in step 1 .",
    "the crucial point is now that for achieving this , everything that is needed as input from step 1 is already encoded in the representation category @xmath92 of @xmath73 . under suitable conditions on @xmath73 , @xmath92 is ribbon @xcite and even a modular tensor category @xcite .",
    "we refer to a chiral cft for which @xmath92 is modular as a _ rational _ chiral cft ; it is this class of theories to which the construction in section [ sec : algebra ] applies . carrying out step 2",
    "can then be formulated entirely as an algebraic problem in the modular tensor category @xmath93 , without the need to make any further reference to the complex - analytic considerations involved in step 1 .    that the algebraic problem in step 2 does indeed result in an open / closed cft as defined in section [ sec : open - closed ] relies on several properties of the spaces @xmath88 under cutting of  and under deformation of the metric ( and hence of the complex structure ) on",
    "these are natural from the physical perspective , but a proof that they are indeed fulfilled in any rational cft is still missing , even though some pertinent issues have recently been clarified @xcite . for a more detailed account and references",
    "see e.g.  section 5 of @xcite .    in section [ sec : algebra ]",
    "we formulate the algebraic problem to be solved in the category @xmath93 .",
    "we do so without making any further reference to the underlying chiral cft .",
    "indeed , we do not need to assume that @xmath93 is the category of representations of a vertex algebra .",
    "in this section @xmath93 is a modular tensor category ; its defining properties ( which we take to be slightly stronger than in @xcite ) are e.g.  listed in section 2 of @xcite .",
    "we take the ground ring @xmath94 to be an algebraically closed field @xmath0 .",
    "we define a _ topological world sheet _  in the same way as a world sheet in sections [ sec : what ] and [ sec : open - closed ] , except that   does not come equipped with a metric .",
    "accordingly , the parametrisations are just required to be orientation preserving and continuous , and an isomorphism @xmath95 of topological world sheets is a continuous map compatible with orientations and parametrisations . for @xmath96 or @xmath97 continuous orientation preserving embeddings ,",
    "the cut topological world sheet @xmath27 is defined in the same way as in sections [ sec : what ] and [ sec : open - closed ] , too . from now on we will only consider topological world sheets ; for brevity we will therefore omit the explicit mentioning of the qualification ` topological . '",
    "we denote by @xmath98 the dual modular tensor category of @xmath93 , that is , @xmath93 with the braiding replaced by the inverse braiding , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further , let @xmath99 be the product of @xmath93 and @xmath98 in the sense of enriched ( over @xmath100 ) category theory , i.e.  the modular tensor category obtained by idempotent completion of the category whose objects are pairs of objects of @xmath93 and @xmath98 and whose morphism spaces are tensor products over @xmath0 of the morphism spaces of @xmath93 and @xmath98 . with these concepts , and using mappings @xmath101 , @xmath28 and vector spaces @xmath102 to be defined below , the task of constructing a full cft can be summarised as follows .",

    "once we have chosen @xmath61 , we further select objects @xmath110 and @xmath111 of @xmath93 in such a way that @xmath61 is a subobject of @xmath112 . with the help of these objects we can give a prescription , to be detailed in sections [ sec : x - v(x ) ] and [ sec : trlast ] below , how to obtain from @xmath113 and @xmath62 the quantities @xmath101 , @xmath28 and @xmath102 entering in the formulation of part ( ii ) of the problem ,",

    "let us make a few comments on how problem [ prob : lem ] relates to the discussion in section [ sec : motivate ] .",
    "as the notation suggests , @xmath61 and @xmath62 correspond the spaces of states of an open / closed cft .",
    "but the space @xmath88 in problem [ prob : lem ] does not correspond to the space of conformal blocks on the double of @xmath87 that appeared in the discussion in section [ sec : chiral - full ] ( this would require a complex structure ) , but rather to the space of flat sections in the relevant vector bundle of conformal blocks of conformal blocks over @xmath86 is equipped only with a projectively flat connection , one must consider flat sections in the projective bundle @xmath118 . ] .",

    "in this way the dependence of the correlators on the complex structure on the world sheet is recovered .      to obtain the prescription announced after problem [ prob : lem ] , and to arrive ( in section [ sec : corr ] ) at the solution to the problem",

    "the geometry is more involved .",
    "the proof of property * ( a2 ) * for this case is sketched in appendix [ app : bulk - fact ] .",
    "we have argued in section [ sec : motivate ] that solving problem [ prob : lem ] is equivalent to constructing an open / closed cft whose underlying chiral symmetry is a given rational vertex algebra .",
    "section [ sec : algebra ] was devoted to the precise formulation of problem [ prob : lem ] and to proving that solutions can be obtained from symmetric special frobenius algebras in the relevant modular tensor category @xmath93 . to set these considerations into perspective ,",
    "let us mention a number of issues that we did not address in the discussions above .",
    "+ from a quantum field theoretic point of view it is natural to allow different physical boundary segments to carry different boundary conditions . in the algebraic setting , boundary conditions are left modules of the algebra @xmath1 , see @xcite .",
    "+ we have _ not _ claimed that _ every _ solution to problem [ prob : lem ] gives rise to a symmetric special frobenius algebra in @xmath93 . to address this point",
    "is an obvious next step in our future work . +",
    "another question is whether different symmetric special frobenius algebras in @xmath93 yield different cfts .",
    "one finds that an oriented open / closed cft together with _ all _ its symmetry preserving boundary conditions is encoded not by a single such algebra , but by a _",
    "morita class _ of symmetric special frobenius algebras , or , equivalently , by an appropriate _ module category _ over @xmath93 , see section 4.1 of @xcite for details and references . on the other hand , an oriented open / closed cft with _ one _ preferred boundary condition  the situation discussed in the present article",
    " corresponds to an _ isomorphism _ class of symmetric ( normalised ) special frobenius algebras .",
    "+ we have only treated open / closed cfts on oriented world sheets .",
    "results similar to those discussed here can also be obtained for _ unoriented _ world sheets , in which case suitable equivalence classes of so - called jandl algebras are the relevant algebraic structure , see @xcite and section 11 of @xcite . + in another approach @xcite to the algebraic part of the construction of a cft it is argued that the structure of a weak hopf algebra can be extracted from a rational open / closed cft .",
    "the connection to the present approach is via module categories , see section 4 of @xcite for more details .    as a closing remark ,",
    "let us emphasise the following point .",
    "we have seen that algebras in braided monoidal categories appear naturally in the study of cfts .",
    "various physical quantities on the cft side correspond to a standard construction on the algebraic side .",
    "boundary conditions versus modules over an algebra provide just one example , but there are many more ; see e.g.  the dictionary in section 7 of @xcite .",
    "one can thus try and use cft as a guiding principle in generalising other aspects of algebra from vector spaces to a truly braided setting .",
    "the centre of an algebra @xmath1 provides a nice illustration of this idea . in the braided",
    "setting one must consider two centres , the left centre @xmath252 and the right centre @xmath253 @xcite . both are subobjects of @xmath1 , and they coincide if the braiding is symmetric .",
    "comparing the example at the end of section [ sec : open - closed ] and the statement of theorem [ thm : solve ] , another natural object to consider is @xmath205 , which unlike @xmath1 and @xmath254 is not an object of @xmath93 , but of @xmath99 .",
    "actually this subsumes the notion of left and right centre in the sense that both @xmath255 and @xmath256 are subobjects of @xmath205 .",
    "further , there is a notion of a centre @xmath257 of a monoidal category , which for a modular tensor category @xmath93 is given by @xmath258 @xcite .",
    "thus for a symmetric special frobenius algebra @xmath1 in a modular tensor category @xmath93 , the object @xmath205 is a commutative symmetric frobenius algebra in the centre @xmath259 .",
    "other examples of structures and results arising when generalising algebra to the braided setting , and which become tautological when the braiding is symmetric , can be found in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the issues investigated in @xcite were motivated from problems in cft , too .",
    "in the following we freely use notation from @xcite . we will show that , as objects in @xmath99 , z(a ) c_l ( ( a ) t _ ) , [ eq : za - cl - iso ] where @xmath260 as an object of @xmath99 ( see sections 2.4 and 6.3 of @xcite ) and @xmath261 denotes the left centre . since both @xmath1 and @xmath262 are symmetric special frobenius algebras ,",
    "so is @xmath263 .",
    "then , by proposition 2.37(i ) of @xcite , the left centre @xmath264 is a commutative symmetric frobenius algebra .",
    "together with the isomorphism ( [ eq : za - cl - iso ] ) this proves proposition [ prop : za ] .    to establish the isomorphism ( [ eq : za - cl - iso ] ) we combine propositions 3.14(i ) and 3.6 of @xcite so as to find    l ( c_l((a)t _ ) , u_p ) +   + ( e^l_a ( t _ ) , u_p ) +   + ( ( a ) ^- t _ , ( a ) ^+ ( u_p ) ) +   + _ k ( a ^- u_k , a ^+ u_p ) _ ( , ) .",

    "since @xmath265 are representatives for the isomorphism classes of simple objects of the semisimple category @xmath266 , this shows that @xmath205 and @xmath267 are indeed isomorphic as objects in @xmath99 , and thus completes the proof .",
    "here we present some details of the proof that the construction presented in section [ sec : corr ] solves the requirement * ( a2 ) * also when cutting along a circle , i.e.  for an embedding @xmath159 . to this end",
