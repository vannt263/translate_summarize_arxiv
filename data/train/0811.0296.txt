    "by mazur s theorem @xcite , the order of a nontrivial torsion point on an elliptic curve over the rational numbers must belong to the set @xmath3 conversely , for each @xmath4 , an infinite family of elliptic curves over @xmath5 containing a point of order @xmath1 is exhibited by the parametrizations of kubert @xcite . for @xmath6 .",
    "we consider only the subgroups @xmath7 here . ] over a finite field @xmath8 , these parametrizations provide an easy way to generate universal families of curves whose order is divisible by @xmath1 .",
    "this can accelerate applications that search for an elliptic curve with a particular property , such as a curves with smooth order ( as in the elliptic curve factorization method @xcite ) , or curves with a particular endomorphism ring ( as when computing hilbert class polynomials with the chinese remainder theorem @xcite ) .    to generate an elliptic curve @xmath9 with non - trivial 7-torsion",
    ", for example , one applies @xcite .",
    "pick @xmath10 , then use @xmath11 and @xmath12 to define @xmath13 provided @xmath14 is nonsingular , we obtain an elliptic curve on which the point @xmath15 has order 7 .",
    "by contrast , obtaining such a curve by trial and error is far more time consuming : testing for 7-torsion typically involves finding the roots of a degree 24 polynomial ( the 7-division polynomial ) , and several curves may need to be tested ( approximately six on average ) .",
    "mazur s theorem limits us to @xmath4 , but we can proceed further if we do not restrict ourselves to curves defined over @xmath5 .",
    "reichert treats @xmath16 over quadratic extensions of @xmath5 using @xmath0 , the modular curve that parametrizes elliptic curves with a point of order @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we may be able to realize a curve defined over @xmath17 $ ] in @xmath8 , but only if @xmath18 is a quadratic residue in @xmath8 .    alternatively",
    ", we can use a point on @xmath19 to directly construct @xmath20 containing a point of order @xmath1 .",
    "this applies in any sufficiently large finite field , for all @xmath21 ( see @xcite for @xmath22 ) . for @xmath4 the curve @xmath0 has genus 0 and we simply obtain the kubert parametrizations , but in general we construct @xmath14 from a point @xmath23 on @xmath0 via a birational map that depends on the defining equation we choose for @xmath0 .",
    "for example , to obtain a curve with non - trivial 13-torsion , we use a point on @xmath24 which may be obtained by choosing @xmath25 at random and attempting to solve the resulting quadratic equation for @xmath26 in @xmath8 .",
    "has genus 1 ( @xmath27 ) we may obtain additional points more efficiently using the group operation on @xmath0 ( see section [ section : finitefields ] ) . ]",
    "we then apply the transformation @xmath28 set @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and construct @xmath14 . if we obtain a singular curve ( or if @xmath31 ) we try again with a different point on @xmath32 ( this rarely happens ) .    to apply this method",
    "we require a defining equation for @xmath33 along with a suitable birational map .",
    "for fast computation we seek a plane model @xmath34 that minimizes the degree @xmath18 of one of its variables . for @xmath35",
    "one can derive these from the results of reichert ( and kubert ) .",
    "reichert s method can be applied to @xmath36 , but the  raw \" form of @xmath0 initially obtained is quite large and of higher degree than necessary .",
    "more compact defining equations for @xmath0 are given by yang @xcite for @xmath37 , but these do not minimize @xmath18 .",
    "the minimal value @xmath38 is a topic of some interest @xcite , since we can construct ( infinitely many ) elliptic curves containing a point of order @xmath1 over number fields of degree @xmath18 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "few values of @xmath40 are known ( see sequence a146879 in the oeis @xcite )",
    ".    given a plane model for @xmath0 , we may attempt to reduce its complexity ( degree , number of terms , and coefficient size ) through a judiciously chosen sequence of rational transformations .",
    "this procedure is somewhat _ ad hoc _ , however , and finding an optimal ( or even good ) sequence becomes difficult for larger @xmath1 .",
    "we treat this as a combinatorial optimization problem , applying standard search techniques to obtain a solution that is locally optimal under a relation we define .",
    "we can not claim that the results are globally optimal , but they do yield an upper bound on @xmath41 . for @xmath37",
    "we are able to match known lower bounds for @xmath40 @xcite , including @xmath42 , which we believe to be new .",

    "* iii.2.3 ) , we double the point @xmath15 to obtain @xmath55 , and for @xmath56 compute the point @xmath57 in terms of @xmath58 using @xmath59 we find that the inverse of @xmath58 is @xmath60 if @xmath61 is an @xmath1-torsion point and @xmath62 , then we must have @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath64 this implies @xmath65 , and if @xmath66 we have @xmath67 . for @xmath54 this requires @xmath21 . when @xmath65 either @xmath68 or @xmath63 , and in the latter case @xmath61 is an @xmath1-torsion point .",
    "if we choose @xmath69 and @xmath70 we ensure that @xmath71 , obtaining a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath1-torsion : @xmath72 valid for @xmath21 .",

    "we then remove from @xmath84 any factors prohibited by our assumptions ( namely @xmath50 , @xmath85 , and @xmath51 ) , and also factors corresponding to @xmath86-torsion for any @xmath87 dividing @xmath1 ( such as @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 ) .. in practice @xmath92 is simply the largest irreducible factor of @xmath83 . ]",
    "let @xmath92 denote the polynomial that remains .",
    "we claim that @xmath48 is a defining equation for @xmath0 . by construction ,",
    "any solution to @xmath48 will produce a curve @xmath14 , with @xmath29 and @xmath93 , on which @xmath61 is a point of order @xmath1 , provided that @xmath53 .",
    "conversely , any curve @xmath14 on which @xmath61 has order @xmath76 yields a solution @xmath94 , @xmath95 to @xmath48 .",
