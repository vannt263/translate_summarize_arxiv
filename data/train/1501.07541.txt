    "soliton and black hole solutions of einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory have been studied extensively for over twenty years ( see , for example , ref .   for a review ) .",
    "the first solutions found were spherically symmetric , purely magnetic , asymptotically flat , solitons @xcite and black holes @xcite in four - dimensional @xmath5 eym .",
    "discrete families of solutions were found numerically and their existence was later proven ( see refs .   for some analytic work ) .",
    "the purely magnetic gauge field is described by a single function @xmath7 , which has at least one zero .",
    "the families of solutions are characterized by the event horizon radius @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 corresponding to soliton solutions ) and the number of zeros of the function @xmath7 .",
    "both the soliton and black hole families of solutions are unstable under linear , spherically symmetric perturbations @xcite , with the number of unstable perturbation modes of the solutions being twice the number of zeros of of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "many generalizations of the original spherically symmetric @xmath5 solitons and black holes have been considered in the literature ( some of which are reviewed in ref .  ) .",
    "for example , numerical solutions have been found which retain the spherical symmetry of the original solutions but enlarge the gauge group to @xmath0 ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "the solution space is more complicated with the larger gauge group , but solutions still exist in discrete families .",
    "furthermore , all asymptotically flat , spherically symmetric , soliton and black hole solutions with arbitrary gauge group are unstable under linear , spherically symmetric perturbations @xcite .",
    "the model can also be generalized by considering space - times which are not asymptotically flat or which have more than four dimensions . in four - dimensional space - time , discrete families of spherically symmetric soliton and black hole solutions of @xmath5 eym also exist in asymptotically de sitter space - time @xcite , but , like their asymptotically flat counterparts , they are unstable @xcite .",
    "if one considers higher - dimensional space - times , in order to have spherically symmetric finite mass solutions , the ym action must be modified by the addition of higher - order curvature terms @xcite . with these additional terms , soliton and black hole solutions",
    "have been found in both asymptotically flat and asymptotically de sitter space - times @xcite .",
    "about ten years after the discovery of four - dimensional , spherically symmetric , purely magnetic , asymptotically flat , solitons and black holes in @xmath5 eym , their analogues in four - dimensional asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) space - time were found @xcite .",
    "the purely magnetic @xmath5 gauge field is still described by a single function @xmath7 , but now continuous families of solutions are found , which are indexed by the event horizon radius @xmath8 as before ( including @xmath9 for solitons ) , the negative cosmological constant @xmath1 and the value of the gauge field function on the horizon @xmath10 ( there is an alternative parameter for soliton solutions , which governs the behaviour of the magnetic gauge field function near the origin ) .",
    "one striking feature of the families of solutions is the existence , for sufficiently large @xmath6 , of solutions where the magnetic gauge field function @xmath7 has no zeros .",
    "these solutions where @xmath7 is nodeless are particularly important because at least some of them are stable under linear , spherically symmetric , perturbations @xcite .",
    "the existence , for sufficiently large @xmath6 , of soliton and black hole solutions which are stable under linear , non - spherically symmetric , perturbations has also been proven @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider only four - dimensional , spherically symmetric solutions , but asymptotically ads generalizations to higher - dimensions @xcite or non - spherically symmetric space - times @xcite do exist .",
    "one generalization which has received a great deal of attention in the literature over the past seven years is topological eym black holes in ads , in particular the relevance of black holes with planar event horizons to models of holographic superconductors ( see , for example , the recent review @xcite for more details and references ) .",
    "purely magnetic black holes with non - spherical event horizon topology in @xmath5 eym in ads appeared in the literature soon after their spherically symmetric counterparts @xcite .",
    "unlike the situation in asymptotically flat space - time @xcite , in asymptotically ads space - time @xmath5 eym black holes and solitons can have nontrivial electric and magnetic fields . while spherically symmetric dyonic solutions ( both solitons and black holes ) in @xmath5 eym in ads were found soon after the purely magnetic black holes @xcite ,",
    "topological dyonic solutions have been studied only more recently .",
    "gubser @xcite considered four - dimensional dyonic @xmath5 eym black holes in ads with planar event horizons .",
    "he found a second - order phase transition between the embedded planar reissner - nordstrm - ads black hole and a black hole with a nontrivial ym field condensate .",
    "planar eym black holes in ads have subsequently been widely studied as models of @xmath11-wave superconductors @xcite ( see also refs .   for a selection of work in this area ) .    returning to four - dimensional , spherically symmetric , purely magnetic , asymptotically ads solutions , a natural question is whether the above stable @xmath5 solitons and black holes have generalizations with a larger @xmath0 gauge group .",
    "the answer is affirmative : such solutions have been found numerically for gauge groups @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "for the larger @xmath0 gauge group , the purely magnetic gauge field is described by @xmath2 functions @xmath3 ( see section [ sec : ansatz ] below ) . as in the @xmath5 case , there are continuous families of solutions , parameterized by the negative cosmological constant @xmath1 , the event horizon radius @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 for soliton solutions ) and @xmath2 parameters describing the form of the gauge field functions either on the event horizon or near the origin .",
    "numerically it is found that , if @xmath6 is sufficiently large , then there are solutions in which all the gauge field functions @xmath3 have no zeros . for general @xmath4 , the existence of such nodeless , spherically symmetric , purely magnetic , asymptotically ads , soliton and black hole solutions of @xmath0 eym has been proven for sufficiently large @xmath6 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of whether these soliton and black hole solutions of @xmath0 eym in which all the magnetic gauge field functions have no zeros are stable .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : eym ]",
    "we introduce @xmath0 eym with a negative cosmological constant and the ansatz @xcite for a spherically symmetric gauge potential .",
    "we derive the field equations describing static , purely magnetic , configurations and the perturbation equations for linear , spherically symmetric , perturbations . with an appropriate choice of gauge , the perturbation equations decouple into two sectors : the sphaleronic and gravitational sectors .",
    "these are considered in sections [ sec : sphaleronic ] and [ sec : gravitational ] respectively .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",

    "since we have a negative cosmological constant @xmath1 , it is useful to write the metric function @xmath26 in the form @xmath30 in our later analysis we will also find it useful to define another function @xmath31 such that @xmath32 with this metric ansatz the relevant components of the einstein tensor are : @xmath33 where here and throughout this paper we use a dot to denote @xmath34 and a prime to denote @xmath35 . note that we do not need to consider the @xmath36 or @xmath37 components of the einstein tensor as the field equations involving these components follow from those involving the components in ( [ eq : einsteintensor ] ) by the bianchi identities .",
