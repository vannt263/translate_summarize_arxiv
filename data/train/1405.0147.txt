    "successes in the design and development of nano - machines motivate the study of communication methodologies between such units .",
    "interconnected nano - networks have potential applications in biomedical , industrial and environmentally engineered systems @xcite .",
    "herein , we examine strategies for molecular communication , inspired by biological systems . in particular , we examine a point - to - point communication system via molecular diffusion @xcite ( see @xcite for the motivation of using this type of communication ) . a nano - transmitter releases molecules into the medium which are collected at a receiver .",
    "information can be transmitted by manipulating the number , type , and timing of the molecules . motivated by classical radio communication strategies ,",
    "several molecular modulations have been recently introduced , including concentration shift keying ( csk ) ( _ number _ of molecules ) , molecular shift keying ( mosk ) ( molecule _ types _ ) , molecular concentration shift keying ( mcsk ) ( a combination of the previous two ) @xcite , the timing modulation ( e.g. see @xcite ) and ratio - based modulations using properties of isomers @xcite .",
    "they are appealing because they use simple transmitter and receivers .",
    "due to properties of diffusion , inter - symbol interference can occur ( molecules from previous transmissions hitting the receiver after a long delay ) . by alternating molecule types ,",
    "mcsk has zero interference from the previous symbol at the expense of two molecule types , but still suffers from interference from the other past symbols .",
    "this interference becomes significant at high data rates , corresponding to small symbol transmission periods .",
    "performance degradation due to interference is studied in @xcite . the optimal receiver for a linear time - invariant propagation model",
    "is determined in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these receivers demand high computational and memory complexities , making them impractical for resource limited nano - machines .",
    "maximum likelihood sequence detection is considerd in @xcite as well as sub - optimal and practical detectors .    in this paper",
    "we consider the communication model introduced in @xcite and depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmitterschematic ] , where the transmitter has a storage of molecules .",
    "the storage has an outlet whose size controls how many molecules can exit the storage and diffuse in the environment .",
    "the outlet of the storage can be controlled ; it opens for a short period and the size of the opening in time slot @xmath0 , @xmath1 is specified by the encoder for signaling .",
    "the released molecules diffuse through the environment ( a diffusion channel ) and a subset of the released molecules hits the receiver . the receptors at the receiver make chemical bonds with the received guest molecules and initiate a pre - defined process .",
    "the general block diagram of the receiver is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmitterschematic ] .",
    "the front - end of the receiver is a counter , which tracks the number of received molecules .",
    "the decoder is allowed to read the counter and reset it .",
    "the decoder makes its decision about the transmitted symbols based on the read counts .",
    "transceiver complexity is a significant issue for communication between nano - machines @xcite . as such ,",
    "we restrict our attention to transceiver systems that have simple implementations , exploit limited memory , and as a result a limited decoding delay .",
    "in particular , we assume that uncoded message symbols are transmitted , one - by - one .",
    "the receivers have either zero or one symbol delay , with a @xmath2 of bits of memory , which can store any @xmath2 bit function of the previously decoded symbols .",
    "to justify our assumptions on the transmitter and receiver , we note that    1 .",
    "our assumptions form a restriction on the complexity of the transmitter and receivers thus rendering our proposals practical for implementation in real nano - machines .",
    "in fact , the modulation schemes proposed to date ( csk , mocsk , ppm , etc . )",
    "are of interest due to their associated simple and memorlyess decoders @xcite .",
    "limited decoder memory is equivalent to limited storage , which in turn , implies limited decoding delay to limit the loss of data due to storage overflow .",
    "3 .   while our assumptions are simplifying with regards to complexity , they do not limit our ability to focus on the unique nature of the diffusion channel .",
    "in particular , we have a discrete channel with memory : residual molecules from prior transmissions can be coincident at the receiver with the current molecular transmissions .",
    "since brownian motion is used to model the diffusion channel , and the information is encoded in the _ average _ diffusion rate , the overall channel is non - linear .",
    "in fact , non - linear channels with memory are notorious for their lack of tractability .",
    "we underscore that our assumption of @xmath2 bits of memory at the decoder is not as restrictive as one might think .",
    "we do not specify the form of the bits ; that is , the decoder can store * any * @xmath2 bits of prior information .",
    "the only restriction is that the memory has to be updated sequentially and causally as the receiver obtains a new output symbol .",
    "one of our objectives is to determine what should be stored and understand performance gains as a function of increasing memory .     to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this work is the first one to study the fundamental limits of communication with memory - limited devices ( previously limitations on power , delay , etc have been addressed in the literature of information theory or communication theory ) . in this work ,",
    "we make four key contributions for the two main building blocks of the receiver depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmitterschematic ] .",
    "_ for the decoder block : _",
    "( 1 ) we propose the memory - limited decision aided ( mlda ) decoder which exploits @xmath2 bits of memory ; ( 2 ) we show the near - optimality of the mlda decoder by comparing its performance with the performance of a genie - aided optimal decoder ( without any restriction on the computational complexity or functional form of the stored @xmath2 bits ) . in providing these results , we also study how information ( or the lack thereof ) about the interference affects decoder performance ; ( 3 ) we prove analytical results , some of which provide surprising insights into this problem : for instance , we show that a natural threshold decoder is not optimal for a poisson channel with memory . on the other hand ,",
    "we show in theorem 2 that ml decoder is a threshold decoder for snrs above a threshold ( which we find an analytical lower bound on ) .",
    "_ for the counter block : _",
    "( 4 ) we propose the use of multiple samples during each symbol period ( multi - read system ) and show that this oversampling significantly decreases the probability of error .",
    "in contrast , most previous works had assumed that the counter is read only once every transmission period .",
    "we first show that the associated mlda test statistic is a weighted sum of the samples read within a symbol interval .",
    "we also analytically evaluate the performance of the multi - read receiver using a saddle point approximation as the test statistic distribution does not admit a closed form .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation is verified via simulation .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : com - med ] , a diffusion - based molecular channel is defined .",
    "section [ definition : mlzd ] defines the class of transmitter and receivers that we are interested to study . in section [ sec : simplereciever ] , a particular simple and practical decoder is introduced and its probability of error is analysed . in section [ sec : mrmld ] , the main results of this paper on memory - limited decoders are provided , with the proofs given in appendices a and b. section [ sec : cb ] makes a case for having multiple reads in the counter block of a receiver .",
    "section [ sec : mcsk ] briefly reviews and comments on the mcsk modulation scheme .",
    "application of our main results to mcsk is given in the same section .",
    "finally section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider an arbitrary diffusion - based molecular communication medium , uniform or non - uniform , with drift or without drift , and with physical barriers or in an open space .",
    "the main assumption that we make about environment is that it is stationary , meaning that the diffusion coefficients in each location do not change over time . due to extensive molecule propagation times between transmitter and receiver ,",
    "the effective channel has _ memory _ resulting in interference ,",
    "which will be more fully discussed in the sequel .",
    "we assume that the transmitter has a storage of molecules .",
    "the storage has an outlet whose size controls how many molecules can exit the storage to be diffused in the environment .",
    "since the number of molecules is large and the probability of each exiting the storage is small , the number of molecules that exit from the storage in a given time slot follows a poisson distribution .",
    "this is the poisson model proposed in @xcite ( see @xcite for a poisson model of the environmental noise ) and we adopt it in this work .",
    "we use @xmath3 to denote the number of molecules exiting the storage ( and diffused in the environment ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is called the diffusion rate and is determined by the size of the opening of the outlet .",
    "parameter @xmath4 itself is a random variable that is selected by the transmitter based on the message it wishes to transmit .",
    "thus , we have a doubly stochastic poisson process ; the rate of the poisson is the information signal , which in itself is random due to our models on the information sequence .",
    "we assume that the transmission occurs in time slots of equal duration ; this is called the _ symbol duration _ and is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the transmitter may only set the size of the storage s outlet at the beginning of time slots of length @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the transmitter chooses a diffusion rate of @xmath1 at time slot @xmath0 .",
    "assume that a molecule is released from storage at the beginning of a time slot , and is absorbed the first time it hits the receiver .",
    "the probability that the molecule hits the receiver during the initial time slot of duration @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath6 ; more generally , the probability of hitting during the next @xmath7-th time slot is denoted by @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the values of @xmath8 s depend on the communication medium , which can be in either 1-d or 3-d .",
    "note that we assume that the receiver and the transmitter are synchronous .",
    "generally , the signal is decoded at the receiver based on the total number of molecules received during the individual time slots .",
    "we assume that in a time slot , three sources contribute to the received molecules : ( i ) molecules due to the transmission in the current time slot , ( ii ) the residue molecules due to the transmission in the earlier time slots known as the interference signal , and ( iii ) noise molecules , described below .",
    "we assume that inter - molecule collisions have little effect on the molecule s movement .    within our reception time slot of duration @xmath5",
    ", there is noise due to molecules in the environment that are not part of our transmission but of the same type as the transmitted molecules .",
    "we model the number of noise molecules within a slot of duration @xmath5 as a poisson random variable with parameter @xmath10 .",
    "assume that the transmitter selects a diffusion rate of @xmath1 at time slot @xmath0 .",
    "based on the thinning property of poisson distribution , when we use one molecule type in all time slots , the number of received molecules in the time slot @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath11 , can be written as follows : @xmath12where @xmath13 is the sum of interference and noise at time @xmath0 .",
    "further , we assume @xmath14 for @xmath15 ( i.e. transmission starts at time @xmath16 ) , hence summation is from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "one of our innovations over our prior work in @xcite is that we explicitly consider more interference terms , _",
    "i.e. _ in @xcite , we argued that a large @xmath5 results in negligible @xmath8 for @xmath19 and thus could ignore interference beyond the previous time slot .",
    "a further innovation herein is the consideration of multiple reads ( sampling within a single time slot ) which also results in improved performance .",
    "we consider a simple , practical decoder structure for molecular communication . to this end",
    ", we make two key assumptions about memory and delay .",
    "the first is that the transmitter transmits molecules at rates @xmath1 independently and thus there is no error correction coding at the transmitter .",
    "most generally , we can assume that @xmath20 .",
    "such @xmath21-ary signaling implies a bit rate of @xmath22 . for clarity of exposition",
    "we assume @xmath23 and that @xmath24 or @xmath25 with probability @xmath26 .    to frame our decoder , we observe that in the case of no interference , the maximum a posteriori ( equivalently maximum likelihood due to the equal priors ) receiver is given as follows .",
    "our observation @xmath27 is distributed as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and the associated probability mass functions ( pmfs ) are @xmath30 the optimal detector is of a threshold form where if @xmath31 we select @xmath32 ( and @xmath33 if the observation exceeds the threshold ) , where @xmath34    in the presence of interference , the optimal decoder can not be reduced to a simple threshold structure . however , threshold detectors are simple to implement .",
    "_ memory - limited , zero - delay decoders:_[definition : mlzd ] in the sequel , we introduce a simple decoder design based on the storage of previous decisions . in order to assess the performance of this decoder , we need to ask what can be accomplished with @xmath2 bits of side information .",
    "to formalize this notion , we have the following :    a _ memory - limited _ decoder , with @xmath2 bits of memory , can store a number in the set @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 $ ] as a shorthand ) for future use .",
    "we use random variable @xmath37 to denote the value stored in the memory at time slot @xmath0 for @xmath38 .",
    "we assume that initially at time slot @xmath39 , @xmath40 . at time",
    "instance @xmath0 , the decoder uses the received signal @xmath11 and the memory register @xmath37 to update the memory register @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath41 is constructed as a function ( or stochastic function ) of @xmath37 and @xmath11 .",

    "a memory - limited zero - delay decoder computes the reconstruction @xmath46 as a function of @xmath37 and @xmath11 only , i.e. @xmath47 for some function @xmath48\\times\\mathbb{z}_{+}\\mapsto \\{0 , 1\\}$ ] . a decoder is called a _",

    "given a memory of size @xmath2 , we are interested in finding the optimal memory - limited decoder , and see how its performance behaves with @xmath2 .",
    "we intuitively expect the memory to contain information about the interference , useful for decoding the current symbol .",
    "more precisely , if we denote the interference plus noise at time slot @xmath0 by @xmath56 then given @xmath50 , one can compute the posterior probability distribution of @xmath57 .",
    "the induced @xmath57 and @xmath11 turn out to be sufficient statistics for reconstructing @xmath46 . for different values of @xmath58 .",
    "but this probability is equal to @xmath59 which can be calculated using the conditional pmf of @xmath57 . ]",
    "the minimal probability of error of a _ memory - limited _ and _ zero - delay _ receiver with rate @xmath60 , transmission amplitude @xmath61 and memory size @xmath2 , @xmath62 , is defined as the minimum of the probability of error of all decoders with memory @xmath2 ( specified by update functions @xmath45 and a decoding functions @xmath63 ) .",
    "the minimal probability of error of a _ memory - limited _ and _ zero - delay threshold _",
    "receiver with rate @xmath60 and memory size @xmath2 , @xmath64 , is defined similarly where we restrict to _ zero - delay threshold _ decoders .    by definition @xmath65 .",
    "clearly both @xmath66 and @xmath67 are decreasing functions of @xmath2 , i.e. the more memory , the less probability of error .",
    "in this section , we first provide a simple and practical decoder and then show how performance for the proposed decoder can be easily computed . in order to compare this performance with @xmath62 and @xmath68",
    ", we will later examine a genie - aided decoder .",
    "consider the simple strategy of storing the decoded rates @xmath69 in memory .",
    "these @xmath2 bits are used to estimate the interference rate which is equal to @xmath70 the updating function @xmath45 for this decoder is time - invariant , i.e. @xmath71 , and can be easily implemented using a shift register .",
    "it remains to specify the decoding function @xmath63 which shall also be time - invariant i.e. @xmath72 . to derive the decoder ,",
    "let us assume for a moment that the decoder knows the exact value of interference , i.e. it knows that @xmath73 . to recover @xmath74 we use a map decoder and compute @xmath75 observe that the above equation is an ml decoder rule , which is equivalent to map because @xmath1 is @xmath76 and independent of @xmath77 ( a function of @xmath78 ) .",

    "clearly the value of the threshold would depend on @xmath85 that are stored in the memory .",
    "this simple decoder is of low complexity for implementation on a nano - machine .",
    "note that the decoding rule described above is not necessarily the optimal map decoding rule , but numerical results show this simple decision rule performs quite close to the optimal one .",

    "as the previously decoded symbols are utilized in the current time slot , false decoding in the previous time slots may propagate to decoding in the current time slot .",
