    "the hole momentum @xmath42 and the particle momentum @xmath41 must be close to each other to fulfill energy conservation , i.e. they have to be close to the fermi momentum .",
    "the double sum over @xmath42 and @xmath41 thus gives a phase space suppression on the order of @xmath183 , i.e. the spectrum starts like @xmath184 .",

    "large particle momenta @xmath41 are involved , the suppression due to the fermi sea becomes negligible and the spectrum behaves like @xmath187 , as for a molecule of binding energy @xmath11 .",
    "this is natural as for large momenta , we are probing short - range physics which involves at most two particles , a spin up environment atom and the impurity .",
    "in particular , at rf energies @xmath188 , we recover the @xmath189 behavior of the rf spectrum that is universal for short - range interactions .",
    "since polarons are found to be weakly interacting , they will form a fermi sea filled up to the impurity fermi momentum @xmath124 .",
    "the fact that the dispersion of polarons @xmath190 differs from that of a free particle due to the effective mass @xmath191 leads to broadening of the rf spectra .",

    "the spectral shape is easily obtained : the spectral function at momentum @xmath41 will be dominated by polarons that occupy that momentum state .",
    "the coherent part of the spectral function is thus @xmath194 with @xmath195 relative to the impurity fermi energy .",
    "the coherent part of the spectrum then becomes @xmath196 where the sum extends up to the impurity fermi momentum @xmath124 . with the free , 3d density of states @xmath197",
    ", this is @xmath198 this coherent part of the spectrum starts at the polaron ground state energy @xmath199 , then grows like a square root and jumps to zero when @xmath200 . on resonance ,",

    "this is still smaller than the fourier width of the rf pulse used in the experiment of about @xmath203 .",
    "the size of the jump is given by @xmath204 and reflects the impurity fermi surface in the rf spectrum .",
    "this behavior of the coherent part of the spectrum was found in  @xcite and was discussed recently in  @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing that the sharpness of the fermi surface and its discontinuity should , at least in principle , be observable in the rf spectrum .      in order to extract the quasiparticle residue @xmath10",
    ", we determine the area under the peak that is not matched by the environment s response and divide by the total area under the impurity spectrum ( see spectrum in the inset of fig . 4 in the main body of the paper ) .",
    "due to the fourier width of the probe pulse , the strong response of the environment around zero rf offset ( the resonance for non - interacting atoms ) adds some weight to the environment background at the position of the polaron peak . to remove this effect in the determination of @xmath10 ,",
    "the part of the environment s response at negative frequency offset is folded towards the positive side ( dashed line in fig .",
