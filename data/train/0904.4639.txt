    "the four - fermion interaction models including 4d nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , 3d and 2d gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite are not only ideal theoretical laboratories to research dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite and in recent years , the color - superconductivity @xcite , but also can find many practical usefulness to particle physics and condensed matter physics .",
    "hence it is certainly interesting to conduct some more deepgoing exploration for these field theory models themselves .",
    "+ let @xmath12 denote the fermion ( called as quark ) field and @xmath13 antiquark field .",
    "since in any four - fermion interaction model , the couplings of @xmath6-form and @xmath5-form can always coexist via the fierz transformation @xcite , so once a sufficiently strong coupling of @xmath6-form leads to formation of the diquark condensates @xmath2 , then there will certainly exist interplay between the quark - antiquark condensates @xmath14 and the diquark condensates @xmath9 in the ground state of the system , even in vacuum @xcite . in vacuum condition , despite of absence of net quarks , however , based on the relativistic quantum field theory , it is possible that the diquark condensates @xmath2 and di - antiquark condensates @xmath15 are generated simultaneously .",
    "+ motivated on the above idea , we have researched interplay between the condensates @xmath14 and @xmath9 in vacuum in two - flavor 4d njl @xcite , 2d gn @xcite and 3d gn @xcite models and find that the ratio between the coupling constants of the @xmath5-form and the @xmath6-form plays a key role in determining the property of the ground state .",
    "it should be indicated that some properties of the system in the vacuum could be maintained to the case of finite temperature and density .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that @xcite , in a 3d gn model with the quark s color number @xmath7 , the conclusion derived from the vacuum condition that the model does not contain the phase with coexistence of the condensates @xmath14 and @xmath2 will be kept to the case of finite temperature and finite quark chemical potential .",
    "therefore , the property of a model in vacuum could reflect its some essential characteristic and this fact will make the research on interplay between the two condensates in vacuum be given more theoretical significance .",
    "in addition , a technical advantage is that all the discussions can be made in an analytical way in this case . + in our preceding work , the color number @xmath0 is fixed to be 3 , consistent with phenomenology of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in this paper , we will extend the research to more general case of any @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the large @xmath0 behavior of a four - fermion interaction model is always an interesting problem to deserve to be followed .",
    "+ we will still use the effective potential approach employed in refs.@xcite and obtain the expressions of relevant effective potentials by similar procedures but omit the details of these procedures .",
    "the mean field approximation will be taken . in this case",
    "we will use the fierz transformed four - fermion couplings in the hartree approximation so as to avoid double counting @xcite . in selecting the couplings of the @xmath6-form , we will always simulate the @xmath16 gauge interactions , where two fermions are attractive each other in the antisymmetric @xmath17-plet .",

    "<S> the results show that the @xmath3-@xmath4 ( the coupling constant of scalar @xmath5-scalar @xmath6 channel ) phase diagrams will be qualitatively consistent with the case of @xmath7 as @xmath0 varies in 4d nambu - jona lasinio model and 2d gross - neveu ( gn ) model . however , </S>",
    "<S> in 3d gn model , the behavior of the @xmath3-@xmath8 ( the coupling constant of pseudoscalar @xmath6 channel ) phase diagram will obviously depend on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the known characteristic that a 3d gn model has not the coexistence phase of the condensates @xmath1 and @xmath9 is proven to appear only in the case of @xmath10 . in all the models , the regions occupied by the phases containing the diquark condensates @xmath2 in corresponding phase diagrams will gradually decrease as @xmath0 grows up and finally go to zero if @xmath11 , i.e. in this limit only the pure @xmath1 phase could exist . </S>"
