    "the dm of psr j2021 + 3651 is by far the highest known in the galactic longitude range @xmath48 , which is mainly an inter - spiral arm direction .",
    "using the recent @xcite update to the @xcite dispersion measure model gives a distance of @xmath49 kpc , at the outer edge of the last spiral arm used in the model .",
    "it is possible that there are further contributions from clouds in the cygnus region not included in the model , where there is known to be excess gas at @xmath50  kpc ( j. cordes , private communication , 2002 ) .",

    "the likelihood that psr j2021 + 3651 is unrelated to the x - ray source is extremely small given the rarity of such young , energetic , pulsars and the consistency of the timing position with the @xmath51 positional uncertainty of the _ asca _ source .",
    "however , the high dm is somewhat surprising given the x - ray absorption quoted by rrk ( n@xmath11=(5.0@xmath52  cm@xmath31 ) , where the errors represent the 90% confidence region .",
    "the total galactic hi column density in this direction as estimated from the ftool nh , which uses the hi map of @xcite , is @xmath54  cm@xmath31 .",
    "this should be a good approximation if the source is truly at the far edge of the outer spiral arm .",
    "noting that the _ asca _ image shows faint , softer emission in the region ( figure  [ fig : xray ] ) , and given the likely possibility of either associated thermal x - ray flux from a supernova remnant or a nearby massive star , we fit the _ asca _ spectrum of rrk , adding a thermal component to the absorbed power - law model .",
    "accounting for @xmath55% of the photon flux with a mekal thermal plasma model ( see @xcite and references therein ) of temperature @xmath56  kev in xspec @xcite statistically improves the fit ( _ f_-test chance probability of 2.5% ) .",
    "the best - fit absorption for this three component model is n@xmath11=7.6@xmath57  cm@xmath31 with a 90% confidence region of ( 4.1  12.3)@xmath57  cm@xmath31 , consistent with the total galactic column density .",
    "the best - fit photon index is @xmath58 , still consistent with the 1.47  2.01 range in rrk derived from the simple absorbed power - law model .",
    "hence the x - ray absorption does not force us to adopt a smaller distance than is suggested by the dm and the value of n@xmath11 may be contaminated by thermal emission .",
    "observations of the source may well clarify this .    for a distance @xmath59  kpc , the inferred isotropic x - ray luminosity @xmath60 erg s@xmath5 ( 2  10  kev ) .",
    "the x - ray efficiency @xmath61 is 0.01@xmath62 .",
    "compared to the total pulsar plus nebula x - ray luminosity of other spin - powered pulsars , this is somewhat high , but within the observed scatter @xcite .",
    "upcoming chandra observations will determine what fraction of the x - ray flux comes from a compact nebula , and will allow us to search for x - ray pulsations .",
    "2cg  075 + 00 = 3eg j2021 + 3716 = gev j2020 + 3658 is the 10th brightest galactic source above 1 gev .",
    "it has a hard ( photon index @xmath63 ) spectrum with no sign of a break out to 10 gev , and has low variability , similar to the known @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "psr j2021 + 3651 s position is outside the 99% contour of the 3eg catalog position , but consistent with the 95% contour of both the @xcite gev catalog position and the rrk position .",
    "the only other potential counterpart within any of the error contours is wr 141 .",
    "although such binary systems have the potential for producing @xmath0-rays from colliding winds , no convincing association with a known high - energy ( @xmath64 100  mev ) @xmath0-ray source has yet been made for a wolf - rayet system @xcite . the pulsar s positional coincidence coupled with the high inferred spin - down",
    "luminosity strongly suggests this pulsar emits @xmath0-rays .",
    "unfortunately , confirming this by folding archival _ egret _ data is problematic due to the likelihood of significant past timing noise and glitches , which make the back - extrapolation of the rotational ephemeris uncertain .    assuming the distances given by the @xcite model , the known @xmath0-ray pulsars have @xmath0-ray efficiencies @xmath65 mostly between 0.0001 and 0.03 ( assuming 1 sr beaming ) .",
    "assuming the @xmath0-rays are 100% pulsed , the inferred @xmath0-ray efficiency for psr j2021 + 3651 , @xmath66 in the 100  mev to 10  gev range , would be by far the most efficient @xmath0-ray pulsar .",
    "note however that psr b1055@xmath6752 @xcite has a similar efficiency if one uses the dm distance given by @xcite , instead of the newer @xcite model .",
    "psr b1706@xmath6744 , which has nearly identical spin parameters , has a @xmath0-ray efficiency of @xmath68 , while vela with a similar spin - down energy has a low efficiency of @xmath69 .",
    "even if the pulsar is located within the perseus arm at a distance of 5  kpc , it would still be very efficient .",
    "if it is the @xmath0-ray source , it would further strain the relationship of efficiency to spin - down energy @xmath70 expected from theory @xcite . while there is currently no observational evidence for a closer distance ,",
    "increased dm from an intervening source in this relatively crowded direction would not be surprising .",
    "we note that the dm derived distances for several other young pulsars recently discovered within _ egret _ error boxes , if the true counterparts , also tend to have high inferred @xmath0-ray efficiencies @xcite .",
    "we plan to continue timing observations of this source , which will refine the position , provide a contemporaneous timing solution for future high - energy pulse searches , and allow us to monitor for glitches .",
