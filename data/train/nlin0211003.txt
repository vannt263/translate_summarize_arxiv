    "nonequilibrium systems with similar symmetries often form patterns which appear to be universal in spite of having been formed by different physical mechanisms @xcite . in particular , reduced descriptions of the patterns often quantify the similarities in behavior so that understanding of one system can lead to insights in multiple systems . a class of spatiotemporally chaotic states exhibiting defect - mediated turbulence @xcite has been found in such diverse systems as wind - driven sand , electroconvection in liquid crystals @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite , fluid convection @xcite , and autocatalytic chemical reactions @xcite . in many cases , such systems have been modeled via the complex ginzburg - landau equation @xcite .",
    "these various defect turbulent patterns are characterized by an underlying striped state which contains dislocations ( point defects ) where the stripes dead - end within the pattern .",

    "an example from inclined layer convection is shown in fig .",

    "previous work on defect turbulence has focused both on snapshots of such patterns @xcite and the dynamics and interaction @xcite .",
    "however , there are numerous open questions about defect turbulence : characterization of the defect motions , interactions between the defects , and the extent to which the analogy to turbulence is appropriate .",

    "the stripes contain undulations as well as defects ; both are spatiotemporally chaotic ( further characterization to be published in @xcite ) .",
    "a number of features stand out in the defect trajectories we observe in undulation chaos . as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ d_f_defecttrack ] , the inherent anisotropy ( due to the inclination ) is apparent , with the trajectory meandering preferentially in the transverse direction . occasionally , there is a rapid burst of transverse motion as marked by the black diamonds , corresponding to a tearing of the pattern across the rolls .",

    "we describe how far the system is above the onset of convection via the non - dimensional driving parameter @xmath2 .    at low angles of inclination",
    ", buoyancy provides the primary instability ( analogous to rbc ) and the convection rolls are aligned with the shear flow ( longitudinal ) both at onset and for the secondary transition to undulation chaos @xcite . over a range of intermediate angles ( @xmath3 for prandtl number @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the longitudinal rolls become unstable to undulation chaos above @xmath5 .",
    "it is this defect turbulent state which we investigate ; some of its properties have been previously described in other work @xcite . above @xmath6 , there is a further transition to a state of competing ordered undulations and undulation chaos .",

    "the apparatus used in this experiment is of the type described in de bruyn et al .",

    "a cell of height @xmath13 m and dimensions @xmath14 was used , for which the vertical diffusion time was @xmath15 sec .",

    "all experiments were performed at a fixed inclination of @xmath17 , within the regime of buoyancy - instability .",

    "at least @xmath22 repeats ( up to 600 for the lowest values of @xmath19 ) were performed .",
    "each value of @xmath19 was reached by a quasistatic temperature increase from below .",
    "in addition , a run with quasistatic temperature decreases was performed between @xmath23 and @xmath24 to check for hysteresis , which was not observed .",

    "here we consider only the defects themselves  an ensemble of moving , interacting , charged `` particles ''  and not the underlying pattern . by reducing the data to a set of defect trajectories of known charge , birth , and death",
    "we can observe how these particles move individually and as an ensemble .",
    "single defects may enter or leave through the edges of the system , or be created / annihilated in pairwise events between defects of opposite topological charge @xcite . during their lifetimes , the defects have positions and velocities which may be related both to the underlying pattern and to the presence of other defects .",
    "we examine properties averaged over these effects , and also isolate some effects due to the latter .",
    "the topological defects are located at points where a roll pair ends within the pattern ( see fig .",
    "[ d_f_pic ] ) . at these points",
    ", there is a phase discontinuity and the topological charge is determined from the phase jump along a contour around the defect : @xmath26 the phase field @xmath27 is determined from fourier - demodulated images for which the complex field @xmath28 has been reconstructed .",

    "after the defects were detected in each image , the defect locations were connected to form trajectories .",
    "this was done by matching each defect already on a trajectory to its closest same - signed neighbor in the subsequent frame .",
    "if the reverse process also agreed on the match , then the subsequent defect was added to the list of defects located on that trajectory .",
    "similarly , the ends of positive and negative defect trajectories were matched up to obtain the locations of all pair creations and annihilations .",
    "when the analysis was completed , broken trajectories ( those missing a creation or annihilation ) were rejoined .",
    "since the defect positions were determined only to the nearest pixel , the data was later smoothed to interpolate the coordinates along the trajectory .",
    "each @xmath32 and @xmath33 along a trajectory was replaced with the weighted average of its neighbors , using the gaussian weighting function @xmath34 \\\\   & \\cdot \\exp [ { - \\frac{(y_i - y_j)^2}{2 \\sigma^2_y } } ] \\ ,",
    "\\cdot \\ ,   \\exp [ { - \\frac{(t_i - t_j)^2}{2 \\sigma^2_t } } ] \\label{d_e_weight}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this resulted in a smoothed trajectory with coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( tildes will be dropped hereafter for convenience ) .",
    "the appropriate widths @xmath37 in @xmath38 were determined by examining a range of parameters and finding convergence for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the advantage of this weighting method is that it automatically adjusts the fit length so that along faster - moving segments of the trajectory we average fewer data points than along slower - moving segments .    from the trajectories",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 , we applied a local weighted linear fit ( again using @xmath38 ) at each point along the trajectory to obtain the corresponding velocities @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "these are fundamentally different behaviors : the former adjusts the orientation of the rolls , and the later the wavenumber . as expected , the decomposed motions are found to be poorly correlated with each other , with a linear correlation coefficient @xmath51 for positive defect trajectories and @xmath52 for negative . therefore , we separate all defect positions and motions into their two components and examine each direction independently .",

    "anomalous diffusion is frequently associated with lvy walks / flights , in which the pdfs of the lengths and durations of the flights are power laws and have infinite moments .",
    "since the central limit theorem no longer holds in such cases , the probability of long jumps ( waits ) will enhance ( retard ) the diffusive behavior .",
    "similarly , the power spectrum @xmath66 of the associated velocities will exhibit power law behavior as well .",

    "the exponents of @xmath77 and @xmath78 do not suggest superdiffusion in @xmath72 , and the @xmath47 behavior does not follow a power law .",

    "[ d_f_pic ] , where there is weaker convection along the slopes of the undulations .",
