    "in the beginning there was dark matter and gas but there were no stars .",
    "today some of the gas that was once dispersed has transformed into stars , and we have light . in places the stars are young , hot , and bright while elsewhere the stars are old , cool and faint . in places the stars have been scattered by violent collisions . in places",
    "the gas never coalesced and stars never formed .",
    "we have light , but light in selective places .",
    "it has been pointed out that the abrupt cutoff of the luminosity function at the bright end and the flat slope at the faint end compared with the press - schechter mass function anticipated by the hierarchical clustering scenario suggests that there is a relative deficiency of light at high and low mass extremes compared with the situation at intermediate masses ( yang et al .",
    "2003 , van den bosch et al .",
    "2003 ) . semi - analytic models that follow the transformation of gas into stars lead to similar expectations ( blanton et al .",
    "1999 , somerville et al .",
    "2001 , ostriker et al .",
    "these same results are found directly in observations .",
    "a full discussion of the observational situation is provided by tully ( 2004 ) .",
    "a condensed version is presented here .",
    "two lines of evidence strongly indicate that the ratio of blue light to mass _ decreases by about a factor 6 in progressing from halos of mass @xmath0 to halos of mass @xmath1 .",
    "_      collapsed halos are the sites of groups and clusters of galaxies ( where in some circumstances the ` group ' may be a single object ) .",
    "the relative distribution and motions of the galaxies in a group or cluster provide an indication of the mass of the ensemble .",
    "many groups are relatively young ( crossing times are a substantial fraction of the age of the universe ) so are not expected to be relaxed . as a consequence , mass estimations based on the virial theorem have uncertainties of as much as a factor 2 . nonetheless , bear with this analysis based on the virial assumption because the variances in mass to light with environment that will be demonstrated are much larger than a factor 2 .",
    "a volume limited sample of groups in the local supercluster , extending to @xmath2 mpc ( @xmath3 ) , was assembled by tully ( 1987 : t87 ) , with the individual galaxies in the t87 groups identified in table ii of tully ( 1988 ) .",
    "the base galaxy catalog was considered complete to @xmath4 within this volume .",
    "the group catalog consists of 179 groups of two or more galaxies , 50 with five or more .",
    "the left panel of figure 1 reveals a striking correlation between the virial mass @xmath5 to blue light @xmath6 ratio and the dynamical timescale of groups as measured by crossing time @xmath7 .",
    "there is an increase of an order of magnitude in @xmath8 as @xmath7 decreases from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the right panel of the figure shows a subset of the sample , groups with at least 6 non - dwarf members , distinguished by whether the majority of the members are early or late type .",
    "there is a clear separation : the spiral rich groups have long dynamical times and low @xmath8 values compared with the groups dominated by e / s0 galaxy types .",
    "mass and luminosity are separated in fig .",
    "it is seen that the e / s0/sa dominated groups tend to be the most massive .",
    "two concurrent trends are found : more massive groups tend to have fractionally less blue light , and at a given mass e / s0/sa groups have less blue light than their counterparts dominated by later morphological types .",
    "the properties of groups from the volume limited survey region with only 24 known members are included in fig .  2 in order to explore conditions in a lower mass range .",
    "in these cases the errors in the mass estimates are very large , which accounts for the large scatter .",
    "the 5 data points with error bars in this figure are discussed later .",
    "compatible results have emerged from the reconstruction of galaxy orbits with numerical action methods ( peebles 1989 , shaya et al .",
    "1995 , tully and shaya 1998 ) .",
    "these reconstructions extend dynamical studies to larger scales .",
    "one is considering the dynamical influence of groups on each other and potentially taking into account mass that extends beyond the groups .",
    "for this discussion , no attempt is made to model the complex orbits _ within _ groups .",
    "groups are considered as ensemble halos and it is the orbits of the centers of mass of these ensembles that are reconstructed .",
    "in fact it is not the specific orbits that are reconstructed that we take seriously but rather it is the mass requirements that are found to give good fits .",
    "the reconstruction is constrained by the need to match the angular positions and radial velocities of objects in a catalog . if the cosmology is set with a specified age then the main variable is the mass assignments . with a given set of mass assignments ,",
    "orbits are found which leaves each entity today with 6 specified values in phase space , 3 of which rigorously match the observed boundary conditions .",
    "one of the other 3 phase space values ",
    "the distance  is subject to test .",
    "our model constraint is a @xmath11 comparison of model and observed distances .",
    "the orbits that are found are not unique given the limitations of the catalogs and the poor constraints on the 3 free phase space components , but _ only models within a modest range of mass assignments give good @xmath11 fits to the distance constraints .",
    "_ basically , increasing mass forces objects with a given velocity to be farther removed from the main mass centers .    in the earliest trials",
    "the minimalist assumption was made that @xmath12 values are constant in all environments .",
    "the subsequent best fits were found for @xmath13 . however this modest @xmath12 assignment fails utterly to account for the large infall velocities toward the virgo cluster that are observed .",
    "rather , a value @xmath14 is required for the cluster .",
    "figure  3 attempts to summarize the observational constraints .",
    "the amplitude of the envelope of observed infall velocities is closely governed by the mass of the cluster .",
    "a very high mass of @xmath15 is required to explain the velocity breadth of the infall region . upon assigning the corresponding large mass to light ratio to the cluster ( and other e / s0 dominated groups )",
    "it was found that the mass to light requirement for the remainder of the objects was reduced to @xmath16 .",
    "the mass requirement found by the numerical action method for the virgo cluster is 60% higher than found with the virial analysis , but applies to the cluster on a larger scale .",
    "the overall average @xmath12 requirement of the action modelling is also higher than found via the virial theorem for most groups but again refers to larger scales .",
    "both the virial and action studies suggest that @xmath12 values increase by a factor 57 in proceeding from the environments of spiral galaxies to the virgo cluster environment .",
    "the faint end of the luminosity function of galaxies in low density environments has a substantially flatter slope than the theoretical mass function of hierarchical clustering ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 , moore et al .",
    "1999 ) . during a study of possible variations of the luminosity function with environment ( tully et al .",
    "2002 ) the idea arose that groups with low mass with very little light might be common .",
    "it was recalled that during the construction of the t87 group catalog a number of entities that were called ` associations ' had group - like qualities except in one respect .",
    "these entities had similar , though somewhat smaller , dimensions to loose groups and similar , actually smaller , velocity dispersions .",
    "if considered to be bound , then the inferred masses are low  in the range @xmath17 .",
    "if one ignores the properties of the galaxies and regards them only as test particles probing a potential then one would conclude that these t87 associations are just the low mass end of a continuum of groups conditions .    the outstanding difference with familiar groups with higher",
    "mass is that these low mass entities have _ very little light . _",
    "the candidate members of these groups are all dwarf galaxies",
    ". though the inferred masses are low , the luminosities are _ extremely low _ and @xmath12 values are high  so high that at the time of t87 there was a reluctance to conclude that the entities are bound ( though there was a suspicion that this was the case ! )    today , with greater boldness , it is argued that these groups of dwarfs _ are _ bound .",
    "it is to be noted that candidate groups of dwarfs are not rare . within the restricted domain of 5 mpc , tully et al .",
    "( 2002 ) report 4 good examples .",
    "this number is comparable to the number of established groups within the same distance , and the census of dwarfs is surely incomplete at low galactic latitudes . as discussed by tully ( 2004 ) , there is now a dramatic improvement in knowledge regarding the distances of nearby galaxies .",
    "hubble space telescope observations resolves the brighter stars and permits a distance determination from the magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ( karachentsev et al .",
    "good distances now exist for almost all the dwarf group candidates and it is found that the spatial correlations are equally as good in distance as they were found to be on the plane of the sky and in velocity .",
    "one of the groups of dwarfs turned out to be considerably closer than suspected based on velocities , with all the observed distances concordant at the nearer position .    at this point the evidence very strongly suggests that the groups of dwarfs are bound .",
    "if so , mass estimates suggest @xmath14 for these groups .",
    "the structures are almost surely not virialized because crossing times are a substantial fraction of the hubble time .",
    "consequently , the derivation of masses are subject to large errors",
    ". the uncertainties can easily be a factor 2 and conceivably as bad as a factor 3 .",
    "however , the @xmath12 values that are found are an order of magnitude larger than the values attributed to loose groups of spirals .",
    "there is little doubt that if the groups of dwarfs are bound then they are reservoirs of mostly dark matter .    the mass and light values of the groups of dwarfs",
    "are shown in fig .  2 as the filled triangles with error bars .",
    "in fact , five points are plotted in this manner and one stands apart in terms of luminosity .",
    "this higher luminosity entity is the near side component of what is commonly referred to as the sculptor group , but which is probably two separate bound units .",
    "the near component includes ngc 55 and ngc 300 plus smaller objects .",
    "the dynamical properties ( dimensions and velocity dispersion ) suggest a very low mass for this proposed group , like that of the other 4 groups of dwarfs . however , the two ngc galaxies are intermediate luminosity galaxies , not dwarfs , so the group is not deficient in light .",
    "it is to be concluded that not all group halos in the mass regime @xmath17 lack light .",
    "however in the ensemble there seems to be a cutoff in light proceeding to low mass halos .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "2 is a fit of the equation @xmath18 this equation relates luminosity and mass with 3 constraints : a logarithmic slope at the high mass end , @xmath19 , a low mass exponential cutoff set by @xmath20 , and a normalization , @xmath21 . the fit minimizes a @xmath11 expression with uncertainties in mass .",
    "perhaps a more dramatic presentation of the same information is seen in figure  4 , a plot of @xmath12 vs. mass ( appreciating that the groups with 2 - 4 members represented by the small open circles have very large uncertainties in mass ) .",
    "it is seen that halos in the mass range @xmath22 manifest the most light .",
    "groups with progressively more mass up to @xmath1 have progressively smaller light fractions , with this trend particularly enhanced in the groups dominated by early type galaxies . at the other end of the mass spectrum , below @xmath0 there is an abrupt cut - off , with @xmath12 values becoming very large and perhaps going off to infinity .",
    "one can suppose that there are low mass halos completely devoid of stars .",
    "the census of galaxies within @xmath2 mpc of t87 that lead to the group catalog can be used to construct a halo mass function .",
    "this is seen in the top panel of figure  5 .",
    "the mass function is poorly constrained at the high mass end by the small number statistics in such a restricted volume . at the low mass end ,",
    "the error bars only account for the @xmath23 bin counting uncertainties .",
    "there are much larger horizontal errors associated with the uncertain masses of small groups . in the lowest mass bins",
    "the counts are dominated by individual galaxies outside of groups , in which cases it was assumed that @xmath24 .    admitting that there are considerable uncertainties in this mass function because of the restricted sample and low mass cutoff , perhaps the greater interest is in the lower panel of fig .  5 . here",
    "one see the fraction of the total mass found in the separate mass bins .",
    "the filled part of the histogram is contributed by the e / s0/sa groups , while the open part represents the contribution by the groups dominated by spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "one entity , the virgo cluster , contains @xmath25 of the mass in the survey volume ( although it contains only 15% of the light ! ) .",
    "the groups of early types together contain 60% of the mass .",
    "considering groups of all type , 90% of the mass is in groups with @xmath26 .",
    "the groups of dwarf galaxies have only been discovered within a restricted 5 mpc volume . within this space , though they appear to be numerous , they only contain @xmath27 of the mass associated with luminous galaxies . yet",
    "the luminous groups within 5 mpc lie on the tail of the histogram in fig .  5 just above @xmath0 .",
    "it is concluded that these groups of dwarfs , though they are dominated by dark matter , they make only a minor contribution to the total mass budget of collapsed dark matter halos . from a cosmological perspective",
    ", it is the high mass to light ratios in massive clusters with short dynamical timescales that have greater implications .",
    "the force is with this dark side .",
    "the work involving the numerical action method was done with jim peebles and ed shaya , while the work on the faint end of the luminosity function was with neil trentham .",
    "support has been provided by jpl contract 1243647 , the stsci award hst - go-09162.01a , and the nsf award ast-0307706 .",
