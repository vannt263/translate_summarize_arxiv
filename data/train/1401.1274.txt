    "in this paper , we use a de - identified dataset from a large mobile phone company in a european country  @xcite .",
    "the data consist of approximately 10 million users and four years of cell phone activity , including both voice calls and text messages .",
    "each data entry records the user initiating the call or text ( caller ) and the user receiving it ( callee ) ; the cellular tower that routed the call ; and the date and time when it occurred .",
    "the locations ( longitude and latitude ) of cellular towers are also recorded , allowing us to infer the location of callers whenever they initiate a communication .",
    "hence , given the spatiotemporal localization of an event , these data offers a unique opportunity to quantify the social response of the affected population .    to study real events covered by this mobile phone data , we need to determine their time and locations .",
    "we study the event set identified in previous studies  @xcite , where the authors used google local news ( ` news.google.com ` ) service to search for news stories covering the country and time period of the mobile phone dataset .",
    "keywords such as ` emergency ' , ` disaster ' , ` concert ' , etc .  were used to find potential news stories .",
    "important events such as bombings , earthquakes and concerts are prominently covered in the social media .",
    "study of these reports typically gave the precise time and the locations for these events  @xcite .    to identify the beginning and the end of an event , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ", we adopt the following procedure  @xcite .",
    "first , we scan all calls in the event region during the day covering the event , giving the event day call volume time series ( number of calls per minute ) @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "then , we scan calls for a number of `` normal '' days , those modulo one week from the event day , exploiting the weekly periodicity of @xmath5 . these normal days call volume time series are averaged to get @xmath6 . to smooth the time series , call volumes were binned into @xmath7 minute intervals .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath8 as a function of time is then used to compute @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the call volume change during the event day .",
    "finally , the interval @xmath11 $ ] was the longest contiguous run of time intervals where @xmath12 , for some fixed cutoff @xmath13 . to be consistent with pervious studies  @xcite , we chose @xmath14 for all events .",
    "to extract the contact network between users during an event , we track all outgoing calls in order of occurrence during the event s time interval @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "we therefore identified the individuals located within the event region ( @xmath16 ) , as well as a @xmath17 group consisting of individuals outside the event region but who receive calls from the @xmath16 group during the event , a @xmath18 group that receive calls from @xmath17 , and so on .    to determine how unusual the observed activities are",
    ", we compare the call volume during the event to the average call volumes of a number of `` normal '' days ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dataevents ] ) .",
    "since a temporal contact network can always be constructed from mobile phone dataset , even when no event occurs , it is necessary to design a proper control for normal days to make the call volumes between event day and normal days comparable .    to design a proper control , we study new `` cascades '' generated by the same eyewitness users @xmath16 during the same time interval @xmath15 $ ] for each normal day , and create a different cascade @xmath19 for each normal day .",
    "* @xmath20 are for event period whereas @xmath21 are for normal period . @xmath20 and @xmath21 share the same @xmath0 , that is by definition @xmath22 .",
    "e.g. @xmath23 users are the users who receive cell - phone communication directly from @xmath0 users , @xmath21 users ( @xmath24 ) are the users who receive cell - phone communication directly from @xmath25 users .",
    "*    the number of @xmath20 users will typically be larger than that of @xmath21 users and @xmath20 users may be more active than @xmath21 users , so the normal day s call volume time series , @xmath26 , must be rescaled when compared to the event day s call volume time series , @xmath27 . for this purpose ,",
    "we multiply @xmath26 by a constant scaling factor @xmath28 , @xmath29 where both integrals run over the same `` calibration interval '' @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the start of the selection window . for most events ,",
    "we integrate over a 24-hour period two days before the event window .",
    "the factor @xmath28 was chosen such that the total number of calls during normal time periods for @xmath27 is approximately equal to @xmath32 , equalizing the normal - day time series and removing any biases due to @xmath33 .",
    "this control procedure allows us to investigate call volume patterns of different user groups .    to explore the call volume patterns in different user groups",
    ", we measure the call volume change @xmath34 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 groups as a function of time , where @xmath27 is the call volume in the event day and @xmath35 is the call volume averaged over selected `` normal '' days .",
    "previous work has studied several aspects of communication patterns , and found a spike in the volume of phone call activity during an emergency event  @xcite . yet , by using the control mentioned above , we find the call volume change for different groups such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 exhibits different patterns in different events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vgi ] ) . more specifically",
    ", we observe activity spikes in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 groups for three emergency events , referred to as `` jet scare '' , `` plane crash '' and `` bombing '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vgi]a - c ) . yet in all other events , there is no volume spike for the @xmath1 group , e.g. `` concert '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vgi]d ) .",
    "these results are consistent with previous findings  @xcite , showing that the users in the @xmath1 group are triggered to a higher communication level , characterized by a sharp increase in call volumes , during the emergency events .",
    "yet , it is somewhat puzzling that the call volume change of @xmath17 users have a spike , which is instantaneous and shows virtually no delay to the spike of @xmath0 users. * note the spikes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 users are synchronous qualitatively , and sensitive to the time aggregation ( see supplementary materials ) .",
    "* as the activity spikes of @xmath0 users for emergency events are both temporally and spatially localized , the communication of @xmath1 users becomes the most important means of spreading situational awareness .    to quantify the reach of situational awareness , we focus on @xmath1 and study their communication patterns after receiving a phone call or message from @xmath0 . as an example ,",
    "we choose three @xmath0 users ( diamonds ) and their related @xmath1 users ( circles ) and @xmath36 users ( triangles ) in the bombing event as a sample contact network ( fig .",
    "[ fig : illus]a ) . there are three types of communication behaviors for users in @xmath1 : ( 1 ) call back to @xmath0 user(s ) , which are edges in orange , ( 2 ) call forward to @xmath36 users , edges in purple , and ( 3 ) calls to other @xmath1 user(s ) , edges in green .",
    "we denote these three kinds of communication behaviors with , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "we measure the contributions of these three communication modes to the total activities of @xmath1 users , finding @xmath39 constitutes no more than @xmath40 of the total volume of @xmath1 users communicating activities ( fig .  [ fig : illus]b ) .",
    "the observed low volume of @xmath39 among @xmath17 users during emergencies is somewhat unexpected , given the importance of triadic closure in social communications @xcite .",
    "hence , the spike observed in @xmath17 users in fig .",
    "[ fig : vgi ] is mainly determined by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the existence of different communication modes in @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : illus]a ) raises an important question : what is the temporal contribution of @xmath37 and @xmath38 to the observed spikes in @xmath1 users activities ? to this end , we decompose @xmath41 into @xmath42 and @xmath43 by modifying the rescaling framework @xmath44 for @xmath45 , where * @xmath46 is the call volume from @xmath1 ( @xmath23 ) users to @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) users , and * @xmath47 is a scaling factor modified from eq .",
    "[ eq : ai ] as @xmath48    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vg1i ] , we show @xmath42 and @xmath43 as a function of time .",
    "we find that in all three emergency events , @xmath42 has evident volume spikes during the event period . and , by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : vgi ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : vg1i ] , we find the peaks of @xmath42 are in close temporal vicinity to those of @xmath41 . yet , for concert ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vg1i]d ) , we observed no clear volume spikes .",
    "overall , fig .",
    "[ fig : vg1i ] demonstrates that @xmath37 , as a major contribution to the observed spikes in @xmath1 , indicating the call back actions ( @xmath37 ) in emergencies contribute more to the spike of @xmath49 than the call forward actions ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath1 users prefer to interact back with @xmath0 users rather than contacting with new users ( @xmath36 ) , a phenomenon that limits the spreading of information .",
    "indeed , @xmath37 measures the reciprocal communications from @xmath1 to @xmath0 , representing correspondence and coordination calls between social neighbors .",
    "@xmath38 , on the other hand , measures the dissemination of situational awareness , corresponding to information cascades that penetrate the underlying social network .",
    "hence , the results in fig .  [ fig : vg1i ] indicate that during emergencies both dissemination and call - back response of emergency information are important for information flow , and they together determine the magnitude of @xmath1 users communication spikes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vgi ] ) .",
    "these preceding results indicate that reciprocal communications play a dominant role in social response during emergency , raising an important question : what is the origin of the observed reciprocal correspondence ?",
    "there are two possible mechanisms likely at work here .",
    "first is the heterogeneous nature of reciprocities : social ties are characterized by different reciprocities @xcite , corresponding to different likelihood of reciprocal communications upon receiving a call from others .",
    "therefore , the large increase in reciprocal communications may represent a selection bias introduced by eyewitnesses by communicating with their social neighbors with high reciprocity .",
    "the second possible factor is a behavioral change of social neighbors after learning about the event , corresponding to coordination and providing additional information to eyewitnesses . to quantify the competition between these two factors , we measure the reciprocity of communications between any two individuals , during normal periods .    in an unweighted network ,",
    "a general definition of link reciprocity @xmath50 is to measure the tendency of two nodes to form mutual connections ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 )  @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath53 for a purely bidirectional link , and @xmath54 for a unidirectional one . considering the weighted nature of contact networks@xcite",
    ", we define the reciprocity of communications between @xmath0 and @xmath1 users as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of calls from user @xmath57 to user @xmath58 within a given period , and @xmath59 is the absolute value . with this definition ,",
    "two users have a reciprocity ranging from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 corresponds to reciprocal links , and @xmath54 for non - reciprocal ones .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : recip ] , we show the reciprocity of communications averaged over all pairs of users in @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the four events during event periods .",
    "we find that , for bombing , plane crash and jet scare , the average reciprocity for each emergency event shows a significant increase , deviating by approximately @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 standard deviations from normal days , respectively .",
    "this result indicates that the observed increase in `` call - back '' actions from @xmath1 to @xmath0 during these emergency events correspond to behavior change in communications .",
    "if the increased call - back were entirely random , the distribution of reciprocity over the @xmath1 population would be sufficient to explain the resulting call - back , but we do not observe this .",
    "for concert , we observe a decrease in reciprocity comparing to normal periods , with @xmath66 below the averaged reciprocity of normal days , indicating clear distinctions between emergency and non - emergency events .",
    "to test the consistency of our results , we also study reciprocity for other emergency and non - emergency events . as shown in supplementary materials fig .",
    "s1 , the reciprocities for blackout and earthquake are characterized by only modest increase , well within the range of one standard deviation , reassuring the preceding results on correlations between activity spikes in @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "3a in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and their increase in reciprocity .    finally , to better understand the origin of the observed increase of reciprocity , we measure the contributions to @xmath1 users behavioral change for different demographics . more specifically , we obtained self - reported gender information , available for @xmath67 of users , and consider all communications in which gender information is available for both parties",
    ". there are four kinds of coupled pairs between @xmath0 and @xmath1 users : male - male ( mm ) , male - female ( mf ) , female - male ( fm ) and female - female ( ff ) .",
    "for each event , we compute the reciprocities for the four different kinds of pairs separately .",
    "we also average the reciprocities of the mf and fm pairs as cross - gender pairs ( cg ) , and the mm and ff pairs as same - gender pairs ( sg ) .",
    "interestingly , we find the collective response from different demographics is almost universal ( fig .  [",
    "fig : gender ] ) .",
    "that is , for emergency events with significant increases in reciprocity ( jet scare and plane crash ) , the reciprocities across different gender pairs are all several standard deviations larger than normal periods ( fig .",
    "[ fig : recip ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "taken together , we have studied the cell phone communications during anomalous events , and find volume spikes in @xmath1 s communication compared to normal days in three emergencies . to uncover the possible origin of the volume spikes , we decomposed @xmath1 s communications into call - back ( @xmath37 ) and call - forward ( @xmath38 ) actions . comparing to non - emergency events",
    ", we found that the dominant component of volume spikes is @xmath37 for all three emergency events , indicating the need for correspondence with eyewitnesses is more critical than the dissemination of situational awareness during emergencies .",
    "we further demonstrated such communication patterns correspond to a behavior change in @xmath1 users that can not be explained by reciprocity or demographics .",
    "we believe the empirical findings reported in this paper present relevant information that can be used to benchmark potential models , and will play an increasingly important role as large - scale data flourish and our quantitative understanding human behavior deepens .    1 bagrow , j.  p. , & brockmann , d. natural emergence of clusters and bursts in network evolution .",

    "<S> sensors for human behavior during anomalous events , finding that the occurrence of anomalous events triggers a large spike in the communication activity of those who witnessed the event . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , they found that communication spikes following emergencies are temporally and spatially localized , indicating information flow through the social networks of affected individuals becomes an important means to spread situational awareness and information to the general population .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we quantify the propagation of real - world emergency information through the contact networks of mobile phone users . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the group of users directly affected by an emergency by population @xmath0 , while users they contact during the timespan of the emergency that are not in @xmath0 form the population @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus here on how @xmath1 users change their communication pattern following an emergency . to be specific , we address three questions : first , to what magnitude do @xmath1 users change their communication behavior ? </S>",
    "<S> do they show the same volume spike as previously observed for @xmath0 users  @xcite ? </S>",
    "<S> second , what is the origin of the behavior changes of @xmath1 users ? what is the dominant feature of these changes ? </S>",
    "<S> third , will a @xmath1 user prefer to _ call back _ the @xmath0 user , potentially offering comfort , support and seeking pertinent information ? or will they instead _ call forward _ to propagate their situational awareness to others . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively we expect that @xmath1 users were chosen for contact by the @xmath0 users due to important relationship(s ) between them , and they may communicate with each other more often than with other peers even during normal days . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important for future emergency detection and intervention to know whether or not there is abnormal reciprocal communication during emergencies , compared with ordinary activity levels . </S>"
