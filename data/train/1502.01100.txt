    "nanostructured gas - adsorbent materials ( gam ) are the cornerstones of potentially revolutionary advancements in critical and fast growing technological fields like molecular sensing , energy storage and harvesting , and environmental and sustainability engineering . their exceptional high surface to volume ratio , regular atomic composition , tunable reactivity ,",
    "transport properties , and assembling affinity to form supramolecular systems , have permitted the realization of timely and cost - effective applications like , for instance , the detection and removal of toxic substances from water and air , dense storage of hydrogen and natural gas in solid state matrices , sequestration of carbon dioxide from flue gases generated in electricity production plants , design of high - performance photovoltaic cells , and enhanced long - lasting operation of batteries , to cite just a few examples  @xcite .",
    "popular families of nanostructured gam include zeolites , metal oxides nanocrystals ( e.g. , cao and al@xmath1o@xmath2 ) , carbon - based nanomaterials ( cn , e.g. , nanotubes , sheets , met - cars , graphite intercalation compounds , and frameworks of organic pillared graphene ) , metal hydrides nanoparticles ( e.g. , mgh@xmath1 and libh@xmath3 ) , and covalent- and metal - organic frameworks ( cof and mof ) .",
    "of all these species cn and mof ( see fig .",
    "[ figintro-1 ] ) stand out as some of the most promising gam for energy and environmmetal applications , particularly to what concerns the capture and storage of hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) , carbon dioxide ( co@xmath1 ) , and methane gases  @xcite .    currently reported gam gas - selectivity and storage capacities , however , still remain below the stringent commercial targets set by specialized government bodies and agencies .",
    "for instance , hydrogen storage systems need to achieve an overall capacity of @xmath4  wt% hydrogen with a volumetric ratio of @xmath5  g / l for competitive vehicle applications  @xcite , and capture of the @xmath6  % of the carbon dioxide produced in the generation of electricity must be reached within less than a @xmath7  % of increase in the final costs  @xcite .",
    "the search for optimal gas - adsorption processes and gam , therefore , remains an area of very active scientific and technological research .",
    "a key aspect for potential gam to be successful is to find the optimal chemical compositions and pore topologies to work under specific thermodynamic conditions .",
    "the number of possible stoichiometric and structural gam configurations is tremendously large , hence in practice systematic experimental searches based on trial - error strategies turn out to be cumbersome and very inefficient .",
    "rational engineering of gas - adsorbent interactions at the atomic scale , represents a key notion to achieve success on such a design grand challenge in the short and middle term . in this context ,",
    "computational simulation methods emerge as invaluable theoretical tools for the screening and rational engineering of auspicious gam .",
    "common simulation techniques in the study of gam can be classified into two major categories : `` semi - empirical '' and `` first - principles '' . in semi - empirical approaches ,",
    "the interactions between atoms are modeled with analytical functions , known as force fields or classical potentials , which are devised to reproduce a certain amount of experimental data or the results of high - accuracy calculations .",
    "the inherent simplicity of classical potentials makes it possible to address the study of gam and gas - adsorption processes considering realistic thermodynamic conditions and length / time scales , with well - established simulation techniques like , for instance , molecular dynamics and grand canonical monte carlo  @xcite . with the current computational power and algorithm development , key features in gam which",
    "are directly comparable to observations ( e.g. , adsorption isotherms , elastic properties and diffusion coefficients  @xcite ) can be computed routinely on a standard office computer .",
    "also , the relevance of quantum nuclear effects in gas - adsorption phenomena can be estimated accurately with semi - empirical approaches  @xcite . nevertheless , in spite of the great versatility of semi - empirical methods , classical potentials may present impeding transferability issues in certain situations .",
    "this type of drawbacks is related to the impossibility of mimicking the features of the targeted material at conditions different from those in which the setup of the corresponding force field was performed  @xcite .    in this context",
    ", the outputs of first - principles calculations turn out to be crucial .",
    "as the name indicates , empirical information is not contained on first - principles methods , also known as _ ab initio_. the interactions between atoms are directly obtained from applying the principles of quantum mechanics to the electrons and nuclei .",
    "transferability issues , therefore , are totally missing in _ ab initio _ approaches .",
    "examples of first - principles techniques include , density functional theory and quantum monte carlo , to cite just a few .",
    "although these approaches are very accurate , they can be also very demanding in terms of computational expense .",
    "this circumstance poses serious difficulties to the study of kinetic and thermodynamic effects in extended gam with _ ab initio _ techniques .",
    "common acceleration schemes within first - principles methods entail the use of pseudopotentials  @xcite .",
    "many materials properties can be predicted basing exclusively on the behaviour of the valence electrons , and by employing pseudopotential techniques explicit treatment of the core electrons is avoided in the simulations .",
    "pseudopotentials can actually be the source of potential errors , however they make also the simulation of heavy atoms and medium - size systems feasible .",
    "fortunately , some strategies can be used to minimize the impact of the approximations introduced by pseudopentials like , for instance , the projector augmented wave  @xcite and linearized augmented plane wave methods  @xcite . in the present critical review ,",
    "we will concentrate on analyzing specific aspects of the simulation of gam with first - principles methods , obviating the outcomes of indispensable and physically insightful semi - empirical approaches .",
    "standard density functional theory ( dft ) techniques ( i.e. , based on local and semilocal approximations to the electronic exchange - correlation energy , typically lda and gga ) have become the _ ab initio _ methods of choice in the study and design of nanostructured gam .",
    "these techniques have been demonstrated to reproduce with notable accuracy the interplay of a wide range of interactions in hundreds - of - atoms systems , while keeping within reasonably affordable limits the accompanying computational expense .",
    "however , standard dft methods present some well - known limitations in describing gas - adsorption phenomena occurring in low - coordinated atomic environments ( e.g. , the binding of small molecules to surfaces and cavities ) . for instance , due to the local nature of the employed energy functionals standard dft methods can not reproduce the electronic long - range correlations resulting from instantaneously induced dipole - dipole , dipole - quadrupole , quadrupole - quadrupole and so on interactions .",
    "another common dft fault is the presence of electronic self - interaction errors , which derive from an imperfect cancellation between the auto - correlation ( i.e. , spurious interaction of an electron with itself ) and exchange energies .",
    "this type of errors can alter dramatically the description of charge - transfer complexes , chemical reactions , and electron affinities  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , many developments have been realized during the last two decades which have solved part of these drawbacks ( e.g. , nonlocal and hybrid exchange - correlation energy functionals , see next section ) , permitting so to achieve remarkable agreement between theory and experiments .",
    "nevertheless , a number of critical aspects remain yet challenging to customary dft methods that could be hindering the rational design of gam .",
    "one of such challenges consists in accounting for the long - range electronic correlations while simultaneously amending the electronic self - interaction errors ( see fig .",
    "[ figintro-2]a ) . along with the adsorption of gas molecules on surfaces , regions of significant electron depletion and accumulation",
    "may appear which induce strong electrostatic interactions and the shift of electronic energy levels .",
    "in those conditions , one could expect that by adding a portion of the exact hartree - fock exchange energy to the selected dft functional , in order to lower the electron self - interaction errors to negligible levels , accurate binding energies will follow .",
    "reported evidence , however , suggests that accounting for weak dispersion interactions in charge - transfer processes may turn out to be also decisive  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the causes behind such an unexpected result are not yet totally understood , due in part to the difficulties encountered in the decomposition of dft energies into fundamental portions .",
    "rationalization of this complexity clearly is needed for optimizing the computational load associated to dft modeling of gam ( i.e. , accounting for dispersion interactions normally requires intensive calculations ) , and also for ensuring the reliability of prospective and already published simulation works on the storage and sequestration of gases .",
    "another important dft threat consists in accounting adequately for the screening of bare interactions in periodically extended systems ( see fig .",
    "[ figintro-2]b ) .",
    "many - body energy and coulomb screening effects can be equally important in physisorption and chemisorption phenomena , and the issues encountered in their description are a consequence of the pairwise additivity assumed in the construction of most dft functionals .",
    "essentially , the interaction energy between two atoms remains unaltered no matter what medium separates them or what collective excitations happen in the material  @xcite . in this context , the adiabatic connection fluctuation - dissipation ( acfd ) theorem has been exploited to calculate correlation dft energies that incorporate many - body higher - order terms .",
    "this is the case of the random phase approximation to dft ( rpa - dft )  @xcite and the dft+mbd  @xcite methods ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : dft ] ) , which at present are receiving the highest attention .",
    "nonetheless , the development of many - body dft - based methods are still on their infancy and the associated computational expenses are elevated ( typically ranging from two to four orders of magnitude larger than standard dft ) . the corresponding degree of applicability therefore remains still limited .",
    "most of _ ab initio _ works published to date on the design of gam are based on standard dft calculations ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] for more details ) .",
    "standard dft methods are very effective in dealing with large atomic systems and a myriad of user - friendly dft packages , practically available to everyone nowadays , have facilitated their widespread use .",
    "however , chemical accuracy is generally demanded on gam design ( e.g. , correct binding energies to within @xmath0  ev ) and thus , for the reasons highlighted in the previous section , employing standard dft methods may not always be adequate .",
    "in fact , to carry out dft benchmark tests on the assessment of gam is of paramount importance for rigorously establishing acceptable balances between computational feasibility and predictive reliability . performing computational studies of such a type",
    ", however , is not a trivial task .",
    "first , one has to be familiar with the technical and foundational aspects of highly accurate quantum chemistry methods ( qcm ) like mller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2 ) , the coupled - cluster method with single , double and perturbative triple excitations [ ccsd(t ) ] , and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , to cite just a few .",
    "in those approaches the schrdinger equation of the many - electron system of interest is solved directly by handling the corresponding wavefunction .",
    "many - electron wavefunctions generally are expressed in real space as a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) .",
    "lcao do not fulfill the conditions of bloch functions and thus the simulation of periodic systems like crystals and surfaces , although possible , it is not straightforward with them  @xcite .",
    "consequently , most qcm studies are performed in supercells containing model cluster systems where periodic boundary conditions are not applied .",
    "meanwhile , qcm are inherently complex and the associated computational load in general scales poorly with the number of electrons ( namely as @xmath8 ) .    besides the technical intricacies",
    ", a conceptual problem also arises when performing benchmark studies in model cluster systems : on what grounds is correct to generalize the so - obtained conclusions to realistic extended materials ? to help in answering this question , we show in fig .",
    "[ figintro-3 ] the partial density of electronic states ( pdos ) calculated in graphene , i.e. , an extended one - atom thick carbon surface , decorated with ca impurities , and a coronene molecule doped with a ca adatom ( i.e. , ca@c@xmath9h@xmath10 ) using standard dft methods ( in both systems the ratio of ca impurities to carbon atoms is the same ) .",
    "we note that the coronene molecule is generally considered as a large enough system in which to carry out computational accuracy tests .",
    "however , as it can be appreciated in the figure the pdos computed in coronene differs greatly from the one obtained in the `` equivalent '' graphene - based system ( e.g. , compare the distribution of electronic @xmath11 states around the fermi energy level in the two cases ) . also",
    ", charge - transfer calculations based on bader s theory show that the ca adatom donates about @xmath12  @xmath13 to the coronene molecule ( i.e. , weak ionic interaction ) , whereas in ca - decorated graphene it supplies @xmath14  @xmath13 to the carbon surface ( i.e. , strong ionic interaction ) .",
    "in fact , quantum confinement effects can introduce important differences in the electronic structure of apparently similar extended and cluster systems , thereby leading to completely unlike gas - adsorption behaviours in the two situations  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , long - range electronic exchange and nonlocal correlations , which are ubiquitous in gas - adsorption phenomena , normally turn out to be disguised in model cluster systems .    an obvious solution to overcome these likely scaling problems , affecting most benchmark studies ,",
    "consists in using highly accurate quantum chemistry approaches which , alike to dft , can handle the simulation of periodic systems .",
    "all the necessary benchmark and dft calculations therefore can be undertaken in a same extended simulation cell . in this",
    "regard , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) emerges as one of the most promising family of methods for benchmarking dft . actually , the formalism of many - electron bloch functions has been established within qmc since long time ago  @xcite and several implementations of this approach are already available in open - source packages like , for instance , casino  @xcite , qwalk  @xcite , and qmcpack  @xcite . also , the balance between accuracy and scalability in qmc is among the highest of all quantum chemistry methods ( e.g. , the accompanying computational cost climbs as @xmath15 with the number of electrons  @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that very recent methodological advances have permitted also the implementation of the mp2 and the ccsd approaches in a planewave framework  @xcite .",
    "the availability of this last suite of quantum chemistry techniques however is rather limited at the moment , although it is likely to improve over the next few years  @xcite .",
    ", @xmath16 , and @xmath11 electronic states calculated in a ca - c@xmath9h@xmath10 molecule ( _ top _ ) , and in ca - doped graphene ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the ratio of calcium to carbon atoms is the same in both systems , namely @xmath17 .",
    "calculations have been performed with standard dft methods , and the fermi energy level in both systems has been shifted to zero .",
    "( this figure has been adapted from work .",
    "@xcite . ) ]      the focus of the present critical review is on the assessment of the accuracy of dft methods in the prediction and understanding of nanostructured gam . despite that the number of dft studies published so far on gam applications is enormous , there is not yet a well - established set of best practice principles for meaningful simulation of gas - adsorption phenomena and materials .",
    "the main objective of this review is to assist in defining this , by critically discussing key contributions and unsolved controversies in the field .",
    "also , we identify here the subtle problems found in the interpretation of complex benchmark studies and propose likely solutions for them .",
    "our analysis is constrained to the design of carbon - based nanomaterials ( cn ) and mof for applications in h@xmath1 storage and co@xmath1 sequestration and capture .",
    "the main reason justifying this choice is that these types of gam and problems currently are attracting the highest attention within the community of computational and environmental materials scientists  @xcite .",
    "moreover , by understanding the processes involved in the adsorption of h@xmath1 and co@xmath1 molecules on cn and mof we may infer also those affecting many other substances and materials .",
    "for instance , under normal conditions h@xmath1 and co@xmath1 molecules are both linear and consequently can not sustain any permanent dipole moment ( e.g. , like n@xmath18 ; the predominant electrostatic interactions with the solid sorbent then are of hydrogen bond and quadrupolar type , respectively .",
    "however , when co@xmath1 molecules receive or donate electrons they normally get distorted and become polar . thereby , from an electrostatic point of view co@xmath1 can turn out to be similar to other important molecules like , for instance , water and amonia . on the other hand ,",
    "cn and mof are structurally and electronically alike to boron - nitride nanostructures and covalent organic frameworks ( see fig .",

    ", other important mechanisms exploited in gas storage and sequestration processes ( e.g. , gas binding in bulk chemical form and thermodynamic destabilization of nanocrystals and clusters  @xcite ) and related families of materials ( e.g. , metal oxides and binary and ternary hydride compounds  @xcite ) , will not be discussed exhaustively in the present work .",
    "the organization of this review is as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize the binding energy targets pursued in the design of h@xmath1 storage and co@xmath1 capture and sequestration gam , together with a short description of cn and mof .",

[ sec : discussion ] , we present a discussion on the current tendencies followed in first - principles design of gam and propose a number of new directions to explore in prospective modeling and benchmark studies .",
    "finally , our main conclusions are outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "nanostructured gas - adsorbent materials contain characteristic nanoscale motifs which are periodically repeated along one , two or three directions .",
    "those motifs generally are composed of light atoms which congregate to form atomically sparse complexes .",
    "there are excellent review articles in the literature focusing on the physical properties and prospective implementations of gam ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) , hence we highlight here only the main traits of some representative species ( i.e. , cn and mof ) . also , we explain the basic requirements that potential gam must accomplish for achieving effective storage and sequestration of h@xmath1 and co@xmath1 gases .",
    "the `` hydrogen storage '' and `` carbon dioxide capture and sequestration '' problems have sparked very intense research within the communities of chemists , physicists and engineers in the last past decade .",
    "the discovery of new materials with large gas uptake capacities , robust thermodynamic stability , fast adsorption - desorption kinetics , and affordable production costs , is a key notion to succeed in the encountered gas storage and sequestration challenges  @xcite .",
    "the binding affinities of potential gam are determined by their interactions with the gas molecules , which can be of electrostatic , dispersion , and/or orbital types  @xcite . in turn ,",
    "the strength of the gas - gam interactions depend on the characteristics of the materials and gas species , which in the latter case include electronic structure , atomic shape , polarizability and permanent dipole and/or quadrupole moments .",
    "key quantities in the assessment of gas - adsorbent materials include the alignment between frontier molecular orbitals ( i.e. , the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital -homo- in the adsorbate and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital -lumo- in the adsorbent ) , and the resulting charge transfers and binding energies .",
    "let us have a closer look into the most relevant physical aspects of promising hydrogen and carbon capture gam .      for hydrogen to become the fuel of choice in future environmentally clean vehicles and electricity production plants , large amounts of h@xmath1 need to be stored within relatively small volumes entailing moderate weights ( for a detailed list of related targets see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this context , h@xmath1 adsorption on light solid sorbents through weak and mild molecule - gam interactions emerges as one of the most promising routes .",
    "( dissociative adsorption in solid metal hydrides where molecular hydrogen is dissociated to form a solid solution with the hydride , is also considered as propitious  @xcite ; however , we will not discuss such an interesting gas - storage mechanism or related family of materials in the present review for the sake of focus . )",
    "current estimations of the optimal binding energy for adsorption of hydrogen at ambient temperature and considering safe delivery pressure conditions of @xmath19  bar , amount to @xmath20  ev / molecule  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , kinetic effects may be critical for practical applications ( e.g. , complete h@xmath1 storage - release cycles must be realized within seconds ) and when these are taken into account favourable binding energies turn out to be @xmath21  ev / molecule  @xcite . based on these assessments , the binding energy range that typically is targeted in most _ ab initio _",
    "h@xmath1-storage works is @xmath22  ev / h@xmath1 , which spans from dispersion to moderately covalent molecule - gam interactions ( see table  i ) .",
    "the strength of the h@xmath1-solid sorbent interactions can be tuned by decorating the gam surfaces with transition or alkaline - earth metal atoms , and this normally tends to increase the affinity towards gas binding  @xcite .",
    "the orbital mechanism acting behind this effect is the kubas interaction , which consists in electron donation from the h@xmath1 @xmath23-bonding orbital to the empty metal @xmath11 orbitals and simultaneous electron back - donation from the filled metal @xmath11 orbitals to the h@xmath1 @xmath23-antibonding orbital  @xcite .",
    "a different approach that is promising for gas storage at elevated temperatures , is the spillover of hydrogen onto inert surfaces .",
    "this mechanism implies the chemical activation of h@xmath1 molecules placed on top of transition metal sites through catalysis , followed by the migration of atomic hydrogen onto the surface of the receptor material ( e.g. , activated carbons , cof , and mof ) .",
    "record hydrogen storage capacities of @xmath24  wt .",
    "% have been recently accomplished with this strategy in metal - carbon complexes and mof  @xcite .",
    "carbon capture and sequestration ( ccs ) actions are being implemented in fossil - fuel burning power plants for cutting the amounts of green - house gases which are expelled to the atmosphere .",
    "current ccs means mostly rely on the scrubbing of synthesis and flue gases with amine solvents .",
    "however , solvent - based ccs technologies generally are not cost - effective due to the high energy penalty involved in solvent regeneration and equipment corrosion  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , membranes and solid sorbents do not suffer from these important drawbacks and thus they constitute the core of next - generation ccs technologies .",
    "there are two main types of ccs processes in which gam are highly promising : pre - combustion and post - combustion . in pre - combustion ccs",
    ", the fuel is converted into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases using processes such as `` gasification '' or `` reforming '' .",
    "the usual thermodynamic conditions in pre - combustion ccs are high temperatures and high pressures ( i.e. , above 100@xmath25 and @xmath26  bar , respectively ) , and the concentration of co@xmath1 gas is high . at those conditions , it can be shown that co@xmath1 sequestration turns out to be effective when the strength of the gas - gam interactions roughly amounts to @xmath27  ev / molecule .",
    "for this , consider the inverse calcination reaction , @xmath28 , to be a model of a typical pre - combustion ccs process  @xcite .",
    "the gibbs free - energy balance of this reaction has been approximated by the function @xmath29  ev / molecule , where @xmath30 represents the temperature ( expressed in kelvin )  @xcite .",
    "now , by assuming that the thermal contributions to @xmath31 mostly arise from the entropy of the gas , @xmath32  ev / molecule follows .    in post - combustion ccs , the co@xmath1 gas is separated from the exhaust of a combustion process .",
    "the usual thermodynamic conditions in post - combustion ccs are low temperatures and low partial co@xmath1 pressures . in that case",
    ", it can be shown that the ideal gas - binding energy scale for solid sorbents is @xmath20  ev / molecule . for this , consider that a typical ccs post - combustion process can be described by the generic capture reaction @xmath33 , and that the corresponding gibbs free - energy balance vanishes at temperatures close to ambient ( e.g. , @xmath34 degrees celsius ) .",
    "now , by assuming that the entropy change in the solid sorbent @xmath35 upon adsorption of molecules is practically null and using tabulated thermodynamic data of the co@xmath1 gas ( i.e. , the corresponding entropy is @xmath36  ev / molecule  k ) , @xmath37  ev / molecule follows .    based on these assessments , typical gas - adsorption energies pursued in most _ ab initio _ ccs studies span from @xmath38 to @xmath27  ev / co@xmath1 , and depending on the specific aims one end or the other of this interval is targeted .",
    "as it is shown in table  i , that energy range extends from weak dispersion to strong covalent molecule - gam interactions .",
    "in addition to these binding energy requirements , prospective ccs gam need to display also favorable selectivity features with respect to the adsorption of n@xmath1 , oxygen and water , since those species are also abundant in the generated flue and synthesis gases .",
    "it is worth mentioning that similar electronic orbital processes to the kubas interaction  @xcite explained in the previous section , can be exploited also for enhancing the affinities of gam towards co@xmath1 binding . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kubas - co2 ] , we represent the partial density of electronic states calculated for a carbon dioxide molecule interacting with a pristine carbon surface , and with the same surface decorated with ca atoms .",

    "meanwhile , merging quantum chemistry methods ( e.g. , mp2 ) with periodic dft simulations that incorporate long - range dispersion interactions , appears to be an effective strategy for calculating accurate binding energies in situations where the selected cluster and extended systems are physically alike .",
    "from all the results and explanations presented in sec .  [ sec : assessmentdft ] it can be concluded that standard dft methods ( i.e. , lda and gga ) generally provide results on the fixation of h@xmath1 and co@xmath1 molecules in cn and mof that are correct only at the qualitative level . actually , in the sole analyzed case of hydrogen binding to chemically functionalized mof coherent agreement between dft - gga results and highly accurate quantum chemistry calculations has been reported by several authors ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : mof - h2 ] ) .",
    "however , in that particular case full consistency between dft results obtained in cluster size and periodic h@xmath1-mof systems is still lacking , and further investigations are required for determining the precise role of dispersion interactions . therefore , our general recommendation is to avoid using standard dft methods in first - principles modeling of h@xmath1-storage and ccs materials when pursuing accurate binding energies and geometries . in stark contrast to this our advice ,",
    "most of the computational studies published to date on gas - adsorption topics have relied heavily on the outcomes of dft - lda and dft - gga simulations ( i.e. , about the @xmath76  % of them in the last @xmath77 years ) . in figs .",

    "the solid dots represent the total number of works published in different years intervals , and the boxes the percentage corresponding to each dft variant . ]    in the case of hydrogen storage ( see fig .",
    "[ discussion - h2-storage ] ) , we appreciate an important recent decline in the relative number of modeling studies performed with lda and gga functionals , as compared to the trend observed during the first decade of the present century ( i.e. , a decrease of the @xmath79  % ) . on the other side ,",
    "the relative number of dft works based on dispersion corrected schemes has increased significantly over the same period of time ( i.e. , from @xmath80  % to @xmath62  % ) .",
    "this last datum reflects , on one hand , the improved feasibility of electronic band structure methods incorporating van der waals interactions ( and the increasing availability through commercial packages ) and , on the other , the awareness of the importance of this type of interactions within the community of materials scientists . also , we notice that the popularity of hybrid and meta - gga functionals have grown considerably within the last ten years .",
    "nevertheless , all these trends refer to percentages and the truth is that , since the total number of published articles has grown almost linearly since year @xmath81 , the total number of computational works that are prone to revision ( i.e. , those performed with standard dft methods ) has actually increased during the last years .    as for the modeling of ccs gam ( see fig .  [ discussion - ccs ] ) , we also acknowledge a steady increase in the total number of published works and a significant recession in the percentage of recent lda and gga studies ( i.e. , a decrease from @xmath82  % to @xmath83  % in the last four years ) . meanwhile , the number of dispersion corrected dft works has increased remarkably in the last years , reaching a maximum peak of @xmath84  % recently , while the use of hybrid functionals has been maintained more or less constant around @xmath85  % .",
    "also , meta - gga functionals are becoming increasingly more popular although these are still the least preferred among all the considered dft variants .",
    "the ultimate dft tendencies revealed in both h@xmath1 storage and ccs gam modeling fields are quite similar , namely there is a firm surge in the use of hybrid and dispersion corrected approaches in detriment to those of lda and gga .",
    "this fact shows that the outcomes of complex dft benchmark studies are being assimilated progressively by the community of materials scientists specialized in gam applications . in spite of this positive conclusion ,",
    "the total number of recent gam design works that still rely exclusively on lda and gga calculations is , in our opinion , unjustifiably too large .",
    "approximation ( our estimation relies on data extracted from the `` web of knowledge '' , december 2014 ) .",
    "the solid dots represent the total number of works published in different years intervals , and the boxes the percentage corresponding to each dft variant . ]    in the introduction section of this review we commented on the two main threats that customary dft approaches pose to the design of gam , namely the difficulties in ( i )  accounting simultaneously for the long range electron - electron exchange and correlations , both of which are omnipresent in gas - adsorption phenomena , and ( ii )  reproducing many - body energy effects and coulomb screening in extended systems .    regarding issue ( i )",
    ", we have demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : assessmentdft ] that good agreement with respect to quantum chemistry calculations and experimental data is achieved when well - balanced exchange - correlation functionals are employed that include van der waals interactions , on one hand , and correct to some extent for the inherent electron self - interaction errors , on the other .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the mixed blyp - d3 method which in the co@xmath1/2-methylpyridine system has been shown to perform at the same level of accuracy than ccsd(t)/cbs ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : carbon - gam - ccs ] and work  @xcite ) . also , the so - called @xmath86b97x - d approach , based on a range - separated hybrid and dispersion corrected dft functional ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : hybrid ] ) , has been shown to reproduce correctly the binding energy trends measured for h@xmath1 molecules on metal - btt complexes ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : mof - h2 ] and work  @xcite ) .",
    "we consequently argue that the _ safest _ options for undertaking first - principles computational work on gas - adsorption applications and the design of gam are to use dft functionals which incorporate , either in an exact or approximate way , long range electron - electron exchange and correlations .",
    "the performance of these `` full long range corrected '' ( flrc ) dft functionals has been tested very recently by several authors in standard benchmark data sets , and very promising results have been attained in all the cases ( e.g. , see studies  @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting aspect of flrc functionals is that these can be constructed in principle by taking any pure or long range corrected hybrid dft functional as a start , and subsequently adding the missing nonlocality of the correlation energy in the form of additional @xmath78 terms .",
    "also , the degree of sophistication and computational expense associated to flrc functionals can be chosen almost at wish by adopting simpler or more complex exchange - correlation correction schemes .",
    "for instance , a computationally inexpensive flrc solution may consist in combining the semiempirical dispersion correction approach due to grimme with any hybrid or meta dft functional of one s personal taste ( e.g. , the already employed @xmath86b97x - d , tpss - d3 , m06-d3 , and blyp - d3 functionals ) .",
    "a superior flrc blend , both in terms of accuracy and computational expense , could be achieved by considering full nonlocal functionals like vdw - df or vv10 rather than semiempirical correlation correction schemes ( see for instance work  @xcite ) . in conclusion",
    ", we strongly recommend to use flrc functionals in future _ ab initio _ modeling of gam and to analyze their performance comprehensively in prospective dft benchmark studies .",
    "regarding the second customary dft challenge  ( ii ) mentioned above and explained in sec .  [ subsec : dftchallenges ] , many - body energy and coulomb screening effects can vary considerably the polarizabilities , and consequently the forces , of gas molecules interacting with extended surfaces and other molecules  @xcite .",
    "the rpa - dft and dft+mbd methods emerge as the two dft variants which can deal efficiently with these types of many - body effects ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : rpa ] ) .",
    "in particular , the dft+mbd method is very well suited for studying large periodic systems containing up to few hundreds of atoms  @xcite . nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "neither the rpa - dft nor the dft+mbd method has been applied yet to the simulation of hydrogen storage or carbon capture and sequestration problems , as shown by the lack of such studies in the comprehensive analysis presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : assessmentdft ] .",
    "prospective rpa - dft and dft+mbd works targeting those gam design areas are highly desirable for rationalizing further the causes underlying the discrepancies found between dft - based and quantum chemistry methods [ e.g. , dmc and ccsd(t ) ] , and in general for substantiating the role of many - body effects in the adsorption of gas molecules on atomically sparse environments .",
    "in fact , many - body dft methods themselves present also a number of remaining challenges like it can be the derivation of an analytic expression for the calculation of atomic forces .",
    "( this ingredient is highly sought after for the realization of efficient geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations . )",
    "work on this and other directions have been already initiated  @xcite , thereby we expect that the application of many - body dft methods will become routinary in the near future .",
    "we animate computational scientists to start considering these advanced computational techniques in their planned studies of gam .    concerning the generalization of dft benchmark conclusions attained in cluster systems to realistic materials , we have presented evidence for a number of related issues like are the omission of long range dispersion interactions and the disguise of electronic band structure effects (",
    "see , secs .",
    "[ subsec : benchmarking ] and  [ sec : assessmentdft ] ) . an effective way of getting rid of those potential drawbacks is to recover the translational invariance in the simulations and to perform all the required calculations in a same periodic system .",
    "this possibility naturally points to the suite of _ exact _ ground - state quantum monte carlo methods ( e.g. , diffusion monte carlo -dmc- ) as one of the most promising approaches for undertaking benchmark studies on the performance of dft .",
    "in fact , the formalism of bloch functions is already firmly established within qmc  @xcite and different implementations of this approach are available in several open - source packages ( e.g. , casino  @xcite , qwalk  @xcite , and qmcpack  @xcite ) .",
    "also , the computational cost of qmc calculations is orders of magnitude more favorable than those of other popular quantum chemistry methods . for these reasons",
    ", we envisage that qmc methods will play an increasingly more relevant role in prospective dft benchmark studies of gam .",
    "( actually , the dmc method has already been applied to the study of metal hydrides  @xcite and metal oxides  @xcite , two important families of materials within the context of hydrogen storage and carbon capture . )",
    "it is worth noticing , however , that qmc methods are neither exempt of some important technical problems .",
    "these are essentially related to the tediousness found in the computation of atomic forces  @xcite and the correction of numerical bias introduced by the nodal surface approximation  @xcite .",
    "an alternative to using periodic quantum chemistry methods , which is computationally more feasible but also tentative , may consist in designing model cluster systems which mimic the electronic structure of targeted extended gam ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : carbon - gam - ccs ] ) and where all the hierarchical calculations are subsequently performed . in following this approach , one should correct somehow for the electronic long - range exchange and correlations in the final adsorption energies .",
    "this could be done _",
    "ad hoc _ by carrying out additional calculations in both periodic and cluster systems with a suitable first - principles method ( e.g. , flrc functionals like @xmath86b97x - d and blyp - d3 ) .",
    "such a proposed long - range correction scheme is very much on the spirit of hybrid dft : qcm approaches , which have been demonstrated to be successful on the simulation of extended systems ( e.g. , see sec .",
    "[ subsec : mof - ccs ] and works  @xcite ) .",
    "the reliability of this alternative benchmark approach , however , has not been yet fully assessed hence further work on this direction is certainly needed before claiming any progress .",
    "in this critical review , we have presented abundant evidence showing that both electronic long - range exchange and long - range correlations play a decisive role in the adsorption of h@xmath1 and co@xmath1 molecules on carbon - based materials and mof . even in situations",
    "where the calculated gas binding energies turn out to be large ( i.e. , @xmath87  ev ) , the same conclusion holds to be true .",
    "consequently , dft exchange - correlation functionals employed in the modeling of gam must incorporate features which somehow correct for standard self - interaction errors and simultaneously reproduce dispersion forces .",
    "dft @xmath78 functionals of this class include the brand - new blyp - d3 , @xmath86b97x - d , and vdw - optb88 variants , to cite a few . other similar `` full long range corrected '' functionals can be tailored in principle by combining hybrid and dispersion correction schemes of one s personal taste , producing so a suite of _ safe _ dft approaches which can range widely on versatility and computational expense .    as for standard dft functionals ( i.e. , lda and gga ) , since these",
    "completely disregard electronic long - range exchange and correlations , we recommend not to use them in the modeling of gam and simulation of gas adsorption phenomena in general . in some particular circumstances lda and gga approaches may provide the correct qualitative answers , however this is likely to occur fortuitously as a result of large error cancellations .",
    "regrettably , current trends realized in modeling of gam show that the use of lda and gga functionals is still quite widespread .",
    "we expect to motivate a change on this tendency with the present critical review . also , we appeal to bring into new examination reported standard dft predictions on gam which are in conflict with observations .    concerning prospective dft work , we animate researchers to consider the rpa - dft and dft+mbd methods in future studies of h@xmath1 storage and carbon capture materials .",
    "the reason for this is to substantiate with precision the role of many - body energy and coulomb screening effects on the estimation of gas binding energies and equilibrium geometries .",
    "this is a completely new direction to take in modeling of gam and , despite that the applicability of many - body dft - based approaches remains yet limited , we believe that it will help in understanding further the origins of the discrepancies found between dft and quantum chemistry results .    finally , we recommend to be cautious in generalizing the conclusions of benchmark studies performed in model cluster systems to realistic gam .",
    "in fact , the density of electronic states around the fermi level and the homo and lumo orbitals in chemically similar cluster and extended systems , even when considering medium size model complexes , can be very different .",
    "those circumstances easily can translate into completely different gas - gam governing interactions . also , electronic long - range interactions present in extended materials generally turn out to be disguised in model cluster systems .",
    "the safest strategy for avoiding these potential scaling problems is to consider quantum chemistry methods which , alike to dft , can handle the simulation of periodic systems . in this context ,",
    "quantum monte carlo emerge as one the most effective suite of _ exact _ ground - state methods for computation of gold - standard benchmarks in gam .",

    "<S> with the advent of new synthesis and large - scale production technologies , nanostructured gas - adsorbent materials ( gam ) such as carbon nanocomposites and metal - organic frameworks are becoming increasingly more influential in our everyday lives . </S>",
    "<S> first - principles methods based on density functional theory ( dft ) have been pivotal in establishing the rational design of gam , a factor which has tremendously boosted their development . however , dft methods are not perfect and due to the stringent accuracy thresholds demanded in modeling of gam ( e.g. , exact binding energies to within @xmath0  ev ) these techniques may provide erroneous conclusions in some challenging situations . </S>",
    "<S> examples of problematic circumstances include gas - adsorption processes in which both electronic long - range exchange and nonlocal correlations are important , and systems where many - body energy and coulomb screening effects can not be disregarded . in this critical review , we analyze recent efforts done in the assessment of the performance of dft methods in the prediction and understanding of gam . </S>",
    "<S> our inquiry is constrained to the areas of hydrogen storage and carbon capture and sequestration , for which we expose a number of unresolved modeling controversies and define a set of best practice principles . </S>",
    "<S> also , we identify the subtle problems found in the generalization of dft benchmark conclusions obtained in model cluster systems to real extended materials , and discuss effective approaches to circumvent them . </S>",
    "<S> the increasing awareness of the strengths and imperfections of dft methods in the simulation of gas - adsorption phenomena should lead in the medium term to more precise , and hence even more fruitful , _ ab initio _ engineering of gam . </S>"
