    "for many years , observations of the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) have traced a whole hierarchy of structures on spatial scales @xmath2 pc ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , often attributed to the ism turbulence . however , the extremely small - scale end of this spectrum , reaching down to scales of tens to hundreds of aus , has been largely unexplored . as the kinetic energy cascades from larger to smaller scales",
    ", it is expected that the turbulent spectrum will reach its end at so - called `` dissipation scales . ''",
    "understanding of the dissipative properties of turbulence , such as its scale , efficiency , dissipation rate , and ubiquity , are important since the delicate balance between energy injection and dissipation has a profound impact on the stellar ",
    "ism recycling chain .",
    "however , many questions still await both theoretical understanding and observational constraints .",
    "for example , how is the balance between turbulent energy injection and dissipation maintained ?",
    "what is the efficiency of the dissipation process ?",
    "does it vary with time and galactocentric radius ?",
    "is dissipation located only in pockets of `` active turbulence '' , or it is ubiquitous ? how do dissipative properties vary with galactic environments ?    starting in 1976 @xcite , structure in the diffuse ism has been observed sporadically on scales down to @xmath3 au .",
    "these findings caused much controversy as the observationally inferred properties were not in accord with the standard ism picture . with a typical , observationally inferred , hi volume density of @xmath4 @xmath5 , and the thermal pressure of @xmath6 @xmath5 k ( assuming temperature of @xmath74070 k )",
    ", the au - scale `` tiny '' features appeared significantly over - dense and over - pressured compared with the traditional cold neutral medium ( cnm ) clouds .    since the initial observations",
    ", the au - sized structures came to be rather frequently detected , with claims that up to 15% of the cnm could be in this form @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable progress in recent years in understanding of the ism turbulence and the small - scale structure in the ism , from both theoretical and observational perspectives [ for reviews see @xcite ] .",
    "nevertheless , it remains unclear whether the observed au - scale features represent the dissipation scales of the @xmath2 pc spatial scale turbulence . at the same time , the observational picture has become even more complicated with improved telescope sensitivity , resulting in the detection of new populations of possibly related sub - parsec ism clouds @xcite .",
    "the `` low column density clouds '' observed by stanimirovic & heiles ( 2005 ) have a peak optical depth of only @xmath8 to @xmath9 and an inferred size of 5005000 au .",
    "motivated by the recent theoretical and observational efforts in understanding the nature and origin of the tiny - scale ism structure , we have undertaken multi - epoch observations of the hi absorption against a set of bright pulsars . because of pulsars relatively high proper motion and transverse speeds ( typically @xmath10 au yr@xmath0 ) , pulsar hi absorption profiles obtained at different epochs sample cnm structure on au spatial scales .",
    "in addition , the pulsed nature of pulsars emission allows spectra to be obtained _ on _ and _ off _ source without moving the telescope , therefore sampling both emission and absorption along almost exactly the same line of sight .",
    "@xcite summarized preliminary results from this project for three pulsars , b0823 + 26 , b1133 + 16 and b2016 + 28 . here",
    "we present results for all pulsars with full analysis .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized in the following way .",
    "section  [ s : background ] provides a short summary of the main observational and theoretical results of the au - scale structure in neutral gas . in section  [ s : obs ]",
    "we summarize our observing and data processing strategies .",
    "results from our investigation of changes in absorption profiles _ integrated _ optical depth properties ( c.f .",
    "equivalent widths ) are presented in section  [ s : ew ] , while in section  [ s : results ] we search for hi absorption _ feature _ optical depth variability . to facilitate further data analysis",
    "we derive the spin temperature and hi column density in the direction of all pulsars in section  [ s : gaussian_results ] . in section 7 , we investigate in detail the properties of the ism along lines of sight toward our pulsars . in section  [",
    "s : sig_features ] we study the properties of the most significant au - scale features found in this study .",
    "we discuss our results and compare them with several theoretical models in section  [ s : discussion ] , and summarize our findings in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "while structure on au scales has been observed in neutral , ionized , and molecular flavors of diffuse gas , it is still not clear whether all these features trace a single or multiple phenomena .",
    "our work focuses only on the tiny - scale _ atomic _ structure ( tsas ; heiles 1997 ) and we summarize results from two different observational approaches used to study tsas in the cnm below in  [ s : obstsas - vlbi ] and  [ s : obstsas - psr ] , as well as several theoretical considerations of the tsas phenomenon in  [ s : theorytsas ] .",
    "in addition to observational methods discussed here , tsas in the cnm has been also observed through temporal ( probing scales of @xmath11 to tens of aus ) and spatial ( probing scales of a few thousands of au ) variability of optical absorption lines @xcite . the reader is referred to excellent articles in the asp conf .",

    "365 @xcite for complementary details on optical absorption line studies , or the galactic tiny - scale structure in the ionized and molecular gas . finally , there are also some indications that even damped lyman @xmath12 absorbing systems at high redshift may contain small - scale hi structure on scales of @xmath13 au ( kanekar & chengalur 2001 ) .",
    "single baseline very long baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) observations of the quasar 3c147 by @xcite were the first to infer the existence of a tiny - scale atomic cloud , having a size of 70 au and hi volume density of @xmath14 @xmath5 , based on variations in absorption line profiles in the directions of separate source components .",
    "subsequent vlbi observations by @xcite found evidence for 25-au hi clouds in directions toward 3c138 , 3c380 , and 3c147 .",
    "particularly large variations were noticed in the case of 3c138 .    the first _",
    "images _ of hi optical depth distribution in the direction of extragalactic sources were obtained by @xcite toward 3c138 and 3c147 , using the merlin array and the european vlbi network . @xcite and @xcite used the very long baseline array ( vlba ) to image hi absorption toward seven sources .",
    "significant variations in hi optical depth with @xmath15 of 0.1 and @xmath11 , respectively , were found toward only two sources , 3c147 and 3c138 .",
    "the latest results on 3c138 by @xcite , in a three - epoch series of observations , show clear evidence for spatial variations of @xmath16 on scales of 25 au .",
    "in addition , _ temporal _ changes in hi optical depth have been found over a period of 7 years , with implied transverse velocities of order 20   ( see @xcite for a thorough review of these measurements ) .",
    "some 10% of pixels in their optical depth images have @xmath17-@xmath18 .",
    "assuming that most of the cnm along the line of sight contains small - scale structure , they estimated the volume filling factor of about 1% .",
    "they proposed that tsas is ubiquitous , and that the lower measured levels of variations in the other cases result from a selection effect due to incomplete sampling of the relevant angular and spatial scales .",
    "recently , @xcite used merlin observations of 3c161 and found @xmath191.0 - 1.5 on scales of @xmath20 au . a slightly smaller level of variations ( typically @xmath21 ) was found in the case of 3c147 , on scales of about 10 au @xcite .      in the late 1980s ,",
    "sufficiently accurate and repeated measurements of hi absorption profiles against pulsars began to be made , and it was noticed that pulsar ism spectra changed over time in some cases , suggesting inhomogeneities in the intervening gas .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the hi absorption spectrum of psr b1821 + 05 changed significantly between  1981 and 1988 , with the appearance at the latter epoch of a previously unobserved feature with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite showed that between @xmath24 and 1981 , hi absorption toward b1154 - 62 did _ not _ change significantly ; while toward b1557 - 50 , a variation with @xmath25 was interpreted as a cloud of size in the 1000 au range .",
    "the early pulsar hi results inspired @xcite to undertake a dedicated multi - epoch pulsar hi absorption experiment at arecibo .",
    "six pulsars were observed at three epochs , with time baselines ranging from 0.71.7 yr .",
    "these authors reported the presence of _ pervasive _ variations with @xmath26 , and associated hi column densities of @xmath27 ",
    "@xmath28 @xmath29 ; on scales of 5100 au .",
    "they indicated that 10 - 15% of cold hi is in the tiny structures , and additionally detected a correlation between absorption equivalent width variations and equivalent width itself .",
    "these results appeared to buttress the earlier vlbi findings of tsas , and they provided a strong impetus for further experimental and theoretical work .",
    "the recent era of pulsar tsas experiments began with the parkes observations of @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , these investigators found no significant optical depth variations in their three - epoch , 2.5-yr observations of three pulsars , and were able to place an upper limit on column density variations toward psr b1641 - 45 of @xmath27 @xmath29 , significantly below the @xcite detections .",
    "they showed that the earlier experiment did not fully account for the large increases in noise in absorption spectra at the line frequency , so that some of the apparently significant variations actually were not .",
    "while no significant variations were seen by @xcite during the 2.5 years of their tsas experiment , they detected variations in the spectrum of psr b1557 - 50 when compared with measurements made five years earlier .",
    "this is the same pulsar whose spectrum was noted earlier by @xcite to vary on similar timescales in the late 1970s . in combining the results from four measurements over twenty - five years , @xcite concluded that the cloud causing the variations is @xmath30 au in size , with a density of @xmath31 @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite performed a particularly exhaustive tsas study on psr b0329 + 54 , which is very bright and almost circumpolar at the green bank telescope .",
    "the investigators observed the pulsar continuously for up to 20 hr in eighteen observing sessions over a period of 1.3 yr .",
    "they detected no hi optical depth variations ( @xmath32 in most cases ) for pulsar transverse offsets ranging from 0.00525 au .",
    "we and our colleagues published early results from a new set of multi - epoch arecibo observations @xcite . based on non - detections of tsas in the direction of three pulsars (",
    "b0823 + 26 , b1133 + 16 , and b2016 + 28 ) , we suggested that tsas is not ubiquitous in the ism and could be related to isolated events .",
    "the current work elaborates these themes .",
    "several explanations were proposed to reconcile the observations of tsas with theory .",
    "@xcite proposed that tsas features could be curved filaments and/or sheets that happen to be aligned along our line - of - sight . by combining low temperature and a geometrical elongation",
    ", the apparently problematic volume density and thermal pressure can be significantly reduced .",
    "we discuss this model in some detail in section  [ s : heiles ] .",
    "@xcite suggested that tsas represents the tail - end of the turbulent ism spectrum which exists on larger spatial scales , and showed that the observed optical depth differences are consistent with a single power - law description of the hi optical depth distribution as a function of spatial scale .",
    "it was also pointed out that the over - density of tsas is due to a misinterpretation of observations : the observed variations in optical depth sample the square - root of the structure function of the hi optical depth , not directly the power spectrum of optical depth fluctuations .",
    "if the power spectrum of the hi optical depth distribution in the direction of cas a , with a measured slope of 2.75 @xcite over a range of spatial scales from 0.02 to 4 pc , is extrapolated to au scales then @xmath33 - 0.4 is expected on scales of 50 - 100 au .",
    "we note that this slope was confirmed recently in an independent experiment by @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that optical depth fluctuations seen in multi - epoch pulsar observations are a scintillation phenomenon combined with a velocity gradient across the absorbing hi .",
    "while in the case of @xcite optical depth variations are expected to increase with the size of structure , the scintillation phenomenon predicts maximum variations on the very small spatial scales probed by interstellar scintillation . however , dedicated observations of psr j1456 - 6843 by @xcite failed to detect any scintillation effects on the hi absorption line .",
    "one of the main problems regarding tsas is its over - pressure relative to the traditional thermal pressure of the ism , which suggests that tsas can not persist nor be pervasive .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations of the dynamic and turbulent ism find substantial departures from pressure equilibrium . instead of well - defined thermal phases , gas with a wide range of densities and temperatures",
    "is found in simulations @xcite .",
    "such results are supported by observations of the ci fine - structure lines by @xcite who found evidence for the existence of over - pressured gas ( @xmath34 @xmath5 k ) . while these studies suggest that high - pressure tsas could be a natural product of the highly dynamic ism , the fraction of high - pressure gas in the ism , as well as the physical processes responsible for their formation , vary hugely across simulations .",
    "the only way to constrain tsas properties and abundance is through sensitive observations .",

    "a higher order polynomial was required for the 3rd session data for b2016 + 28 due to ripples in the baseline structure , most likely cased by interstellar scintillation .",
    "psr b0540 + 23 data were heavily affected by interstellar scintillation .",
    "this pulsar s scintillation bandwidth at 1.4 ghz is 0.3 mhz @xcite , which resulted in numerous ripples across our band ( see figure  [ f:0540_1929em ] , left middle panel ) .",
    "we needed to fit and divide by a 15th order polynomial to flatten the baseline for this pulsar ( see bottom panel in figure  [ f:0540_1929em ] ) .",
    "however , as emphasized in section 4.1 , we do not use this pulsar s data for our analysis due to large scintillation effects which presumably led to the unphysically ( @xmath51 ) deep absorption features .",
    "noise and calibration errors in the pulsar absorption spectrum are magnified by a factor of @xmath52 when the absorption spectrum is expressed in terms of the ultimately desired optical depth @xmath53 . with this pulsar",

    "b1929 + 10 data , as shown in figure  [ f:0540_1929em ] ( right , middle panel ) , suffer from the ` ghost effect ' @xcite .",

    "however , if this relationship exists , it is at a much smaller level than suggested by frail et al .",

    "we note that b1133 + 16 has one feature above 3-@xmath18 ( s4-s3 baseline ) at a velocity of @xmath110 , however this likely comes from rfi as is seen in _ emission _ in the absorption spectrum from session 3 .",
    "similarly , b1737 + 13 has a significant variation at a velocity of @xmath111 on 3 baselines , all involving the session 1 absorption spectrum ; this corresponds to an ( unphysical ) _ emission _ feature and is most likely due to rfi .    for three of our pulsars ( b0823 + 23 , b1133",

    "for example , a scaling error of approximately @xmath130 in pulsar strength in a single epoch could result in an erroneous rescaling of optical depths by a similar amount , which would lead to a spurious detection of variation when there is actually none .",
    "for example , in stanimirovic et al ( 2003 ) , we pointed out an apparent case of this type of problem in frail et al s spectra of psr b2016 + 28 .",
    "however , it appears that the more advanced cbr spectrometer is indeed able to measure spectra more accurately , as we anticipated .",
    "for example , we see no evidence of variations in our experiment with psr b2016 + 28 nor with b1133 + 16 , the other particularly bright pulsars in our sample .",
    "( calibration errors would be expected to be most serious in the brighter pulsars , which can easily increase the system temperature by factors of more than two . )",
    "it is notable that b1929 + 10 is the only pulsar in our sample from which we removed a ghost .",
    "then an obvious question is whether our detected variability could be an artefact of the ghost fitting procedure .",
    "we have scrutinized our reduction procedures and remain confident that the variability is real .",
    "spectra for b1929 + 10 were reduced in the same way as for all other sources .",
    "even the ghost fitting procedure was done in exactly the same way ( using exactly the same idl routines ) as the polynomial baseline fitting for other pulsars .",
    "the derived error envelopes reflect additional uncertainties due to this fitting process .    in figure  [ f:1929_4plot ]",
    "we show all four absorption profiles for this pulsar before ( top ) and after ( bottom ) ghost removal .",
    "only the deepest velocity component at 5  shows variability ( both before and after ghost removal ) , while components at @xmath126 and 8  agree extremely well between epochs .",
    "if there were some imperfections related either to a scaling problem or to ghost fitting errors , they would affect _ all _ features .",
    "we have also examined the estimated coefficients used in equation ( 2 ) . in the case of the 1st session spectrum , for example , @xmath131 .",
    "a smaller value for @xmath55 would result in a larger correction and would bring the 1st session absorption spectrum closer to spectra from other sessions .",
    "however , even by taking values within @xmath132 of the best - fit estimate , the observed variations in the difference spectra would still stay significant ( above 3-@xmath18 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the hi emission at 5  is not exceptionally high , resulting in a small ghost correction .",
    "after all these tests , we remain confident that the detected variability in the case of b1929 + 10 is real .      in figure  [ f:2016_6plot ]",
    "we compare all four absorption profiles for this pulsar .",

    "two recent pulsar experiments found variability at this level but at much larger scales ( @xmath135 au ; johnston et al .",
    "2003 and weisberg et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "@xcite presented preliminary results of this experiment , and noted that the unsmoothed hi absorption spectra exhibited several apparently significant optical depth variations , mostly in the form of single - channel fluctuations .",
    "the most prominent ones were in the direction of b1929 + 10 , but there were a few additional variable features toward other pulsars .",
    "for the current study , however , where we have applied hanning smoothing to ensure full independence between velocity channels , only the detections in the direction of b1929 + 10 survive .",
    "could the additional variations in the unsmoothed spectra be real ?",
    "the minimum expected temperature for the cnm in thermal equilibrium is 15k @xcite .",
    "to achieve such a low temperature , dust grain heating of the hi would need to be absent .",
    "at this temperature , the full - width , half - maximum ( fwhm ) of an hi feature will be 0.8 km s@xmath0 even in the absence of turbulent broadening ; for a less extreme 30k the corresponding width is 1.2 km s@xmath0 . using a large sample of cnm clouds",
    ", @xcite deduced a relationship between @xmath136 , the temperature inferred from the measured linewidth , and the spin temperature @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the sonic mach number . for 196 out of 202 cnm components they found that @xmath139 , implying then that @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , even with the minimum expected turbulence , the hi absorption line fwhm would be @xmath7 0.9 km s@xmath0 at @xmath141 k , or 1.3 km s@xmath0 at @xmath142 k. so while we have rejected most of @xcite s variations because unsmoothed data can be misleading , there are also physical reasons to doubt reality of features with fwhm@xmath143 . in contrast , our hanning smoothed resolution appears to match the narrowest plausible tsas features .",
    "in this section we derive the spin temperature and the cnm column density for gas seen in absorption in the direction of our pulsars .",
    "we employ the technique developed by @xcite , which is based on fitting gaussian components to both hi absorption and emission spectra .",
    "the purpose of this section is twofold : ( i ) our further data analysis requires temperatures and column densities of associated cnm clouds ; and ( ii ) since the cnm absorption profiles are often superpositions of several components , our original hope was to search for temporal changes in both the peak optical depth and velocity centroids of all individual velocity components .",
    "unfortunately , since the gaussian decomposition of absorption and emission profiles is not unique ( see discussion in @xcite ) , our second goal was not achievable .    to analyze each pulsar",
    ", we first selected the epoch with the lowest noise level .",
    "the hi absorption and emission spectra were then decomposed into several gaussian profiles .",
    "we note that three of our six pulsars are at high galactic latitudes and have simple line profiles , easily fitted with one or two gaussian functions .",
    "optical depth profiles for low latitude pulsars b0540 + 23 , b1929 + 10 , and b2016 + 28 , ( at @xmath144 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively ) , are more complex but still with several obvious velocity components .",
    "we summarize here very briefly the basic definitions and the procedure , see heiles & troland ( 2003a ) for further details . for each pulsar",
    "we have the hi emission profile , @xmath146 ( note that this is the emission spectrum that would be observed in the absence of the pulsar ) and the hi optical depth spectrum , @xmath147 .",
    "both spectra in general have multiple velocity components .",
    "we first fit @xmath148 with a set of @xmath149 gaussian functions using a least - squares technique : @xmath150 ^ 2 } \\label{eqn : tau}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 is the peak optical depth , @xmath152 is the central velocity , and @xmath153 is the 1/e width of component @xmath154 .",
    "@xmath149 is the minimum number of components necessary to make the residuals of the fit smaller or comparable to the estimated noise level of @xmath54 .",
    "while the optical depth spectrum predominantly reflects the cnm , both the cold _ and _ warm neutral media ( wnm ) contribute to the hi emission spectrum .",
    "consequently we can write the amplitude of the emission spectrum , @xmath146 , as follows : @xmath155 we now write each of the two terms of eq .",
    "[ eqn : tb ] in detail , using the optical depth profile derived from eq .",
    "[ eqn : tau ] .",
    "first , @xmath156 , the hi emission originating from @xmath149 cnm components , can be written as : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the spin temperature of cloud @xmath154 , and the subscript @xmath159 represents one of the @xmath138 cnm clouds that lie in front of cloud @xmath154 .",
    "next , @xmath160 , the hi emission originating from the wnm , is represented with a set of @xmath161 gaussian functions .",
    "the complicating factor here is that a certain fraction @xmath162 of the wnm is located in front of the cnm , while a fraction @xmath163 of the wnm is beyond the cnm with its emissions being absorbed by cnm clouds : @xmath164 \\times t_{0,k}e^{-[(v - v_{0,k})/\\delta v_{k}]^2 } , \\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath165 corresponds to each of the wnm components and a fraction @xmath166 of the wnm cloud @xmath165 lies in front of all cnm components , while a fraction @xmath167 is being absorbed by the cnm clouds . for a given order of cnm clouds along the line of sight and a given set of @xmath166 values ,",
    "the @xmath146 profile is simultaneously fitted for gaussian parameters of the wnm components and the spin temperature of individual cnm clouds .    for each pulsar",
    ", we vary the order of gaussian functions along the line - of - sight ( for @xmath149 cnm components there are @xmath168 possible orderings ) and perform the @xmath146 fit .",
    "we then choose the ordering of cnm components that gives the smallest residuals in the least - squares fit .",
    "unfortunately , the difference in the fit residuals is often not sufficiently statistically significant to distinguish between different values of @xmath166 .",
    "however , @xmath166 has a large effect on the derived spin temperatures .",
    "hence we follow the heiles & troland ( 2003a ) suggestion and estimate the final spin temperatures by assigning characteristic values of 0 , 0.5 , or 1 to each @xmath166 ( among the extreme possible values of 0 and 1 ) , and repeating this for all possible combinations of wnm clouds .",
    "the final spin temperatures are then derived as a weighted average over all trials .",

    "we detail here some interesting properties of the latter three pulsars lines of sight .",
    "psr b1929 + 10 is the closest pulsar in our sample , @xmath254 pc @xcite , and this relatively close distance raises the question of whether the observed fluctuations of hi optical depth are somehow related to the pulsar s proximity to the solar system .",
    "for example , we are embedded near the middle of a low - density , high - temperature region called the local cavity which extends 1 - 200 pc before being bounded by a high density wall in most directions , so a significant portion of the line of sight lies inside it . in",
    "what follows , the `` local bubble ( lb ) '' consists of the local cavity plus the wall .",
    "@xcite mapped the dense neutral gas wall bounding the local cavity via interstellar absorption measurements of stars of known distance .",
    "the updated map of the neutral gas surrounding the local cavity by @xcite confirms that the line of sight from b1929 + 10 enters the wall of the lb at a distance of @xmath255 pc and then pierces the wall for @xmath256 pc .",
    "a lower - resolution interstellar reddening map from @xcite also indicates that the lb boundary is distended significantly toward the pulsar .",
    "furthermore , the b1920 + 10 line of sight appears to be in or near a long extended neutral finger of the lb ( possibly an interstellar tunnel gouged by a supernova ) and may therefore lie in the finger or along its wall for some distance .",
    "the dense finger is most likely associated with the ophiuchus molecular cloud and @xcite found that the co distribution in this region is filamentary and has radial velocities in the range 4.2 - 5.3 ( note that our varying hi component is centered at @xmath217 ) .",
    "in addition to the above , we found that two stars within 3 degrees from b1929 + 10 have been observed in nai : hd178125 is at a distance of 173 pc , while hd180555 is at a distance of only 106 pc .",
    "based on the data presented in @xcite , these stars show nai absorption at an lsr velocity of @xmath257 and @xmath258 , respectively ( velocity uncertainty for these measurements is 1 - 1.5 ) . as our varying pulsar absorption component is centered at @xmath259  ( with a fwhm of 3 )",
    ", it is most likely tracing the same interstellar cloud seen in the direction of the two hd stars .",
    "this would imply that the absorbing cloud is at a distance of @xmath260 pc , as it is seen against hd180555 , and therefore embedded in the local cavity or the lb wall .",
    "the local cavity itself is a region of low scattering ; while most investigations have concluded that there is enhanced scattering at its boundary , implying enhanced turbulence there @xcite .",
    "based on modeling of many nai absorption features , @xcite found that the @xmath257 and @xmath258  absorption components in the direction of hd178125 and hd180555 belong to a plane - parallel flow immersed in the local cavity , the so - called `` flow c '' .",
    "they suggested that flow c could represent gas condensing out of the lb wall .",
    "generally , many diffuse interstellar clouds ( so - called `` local fluff '' ) have been found inside the local cavity itself and have been interpreted as signatures of the development of rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the wall , whereby gas is condensing out of the leading edge of the lb wall and flowing toward the sun @xcite .    to examine lines of sight toward b0823 + 26 and b1133 + 16",
    ", we turn to figure 7 of @xcite which shows neutral gas in vertical planes at fixed galactic longitudes . in the case of b0823 + 26 ( @xmath261 ) ,",
    "about one - half of the line of sight appears to be inside the local cavity and traverses the lb wall over only a short distance . in the case of b1133 + 16 ( @xmath262 ) ,",
    "the line of sight appears to exit the lb through an opening or a chimney of low density material rather than a bounding wall or any other substantially dense neutral material .    in summary , since almost one - half of the line of sight toward b1929 + 10 is associated with the lb and the absorbing gas is likely to be within 106 pc , we hypothesize that our detected tsas clouds along this line of sight are formed or influenced by the lb .",
    "based on the stellar nai absorption lines at similar velocities to those we find in hi toward b1929 + 10 , we conclude that our tsas fluctuations are likely to be associated with the lb wall .",
    "the high spin temperature of the absorbing clouds , as shown in the previous section , may result from the thermally unstable gas due to wall fragmentation ( see also section 9.4 ) .",
    "it is then not surprising that we did not detect tsas in the direction of b0823 + 26 and b1133 + 16 , despite equally good sensitivity , because these lines of sight do not traverse much or any of the wall .",
    "in sections  [ s : ew ] and [ s : results ] we have identified several significant variations in absorption profiles that could be interpreted as tsas .",
    "all of these features are in the direction of b1929 + 10 .",
    "we summarize their observed properties in table  [ t : tsas_sig_features ] .",
    "we measure tsas properties from ew variations , as this is more robust than using difference spectra which have a lower s / n .",
    "we estimate tsas properties from ew variations with @xmath263-@xmath18 .",
    "table  [ t : tsas_sig_features ] lists the following quantities : the time baseline over which the change in ew is observed , the corresponding transverse spatial scale , the absolute value of @xmath95 , the significance of the fluctuation , the hi column density of the tsas ( @xmath264 ) , the inferred hi volume density of tsas ( assuming spherical hi blobs whose radius is equal @xmath89 ) , and the inferred thermal pressure .",
    "some comments are necessary for interpreting these tables .",
    "( i ) our observations do not constrain the exact _ size _ of tsas , but rather its characteristic _ scale_. in measuring the tranverse distance ( @xmath89 ) traveled by the pulsar over a time span exhibiting a variation in hi absorption spectra , we are sampling a spatial scale over which we have sampled the optical depth function .",
    "therefore , even in the case that significant fluctuations are due to discrete blobs of gas , @xmath89 does not necessarily correspond to a physical size of these blobs .",
    "this point has been emphasized by deshpande ( 2000 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the temperature of tsas , needed to estimate @xmath264 , is also not constrained directly by observations .",
    "we have estimated in section 6 the temperature of the parent cnm clouds with which tsas is associated . in the scenario",
    "where tsas results from discrete , elongated objects , such as in @xcite and @xcite , cnm clouds are constituted from tsas and an inter - tsas medium .",
    "the derived spin temperature in this case corresponds to the inter - tsas medium , while tsas could have a much colder temperature of @xmath265 k ( heiles 1997 ) .",
    "there are several interesting results :    1 .",
    "significant fluctuations ( table  [ t : tsas_sig_features ] ) are found on a variety of spatial scales @xmath266 au ( with @xmath267 being a tsas distance ) , suggesting that the cnm in the direction of b1929 + 10 has structure on spatial scales of 550 aus .",
    "our characteristic scales for tsas are similar to results from vlba experiments : brogan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a typical size of 25 au and lazio et al ( 2009 ) found a typical size of 10 au .",
    "if we assume that tsas has the same spin temperature as its parent cnm cloud ( @xmath268 k in the case of b1929 + 10 ) , we estimate a hi column density of @xmath269 @xmath29 .",
    "this is slightly lower than the typical cnm column density of @xmath270 @xmath29 found for the cnm in the heiles & troland ( 2003b ) survey .",
    "all tsas features contribute 10 - 30 percent to the hi column density of their ` parent ' cnm clouds .",
    "4 .   if we interpret tsas as being in the form of spherically symmetric blobs , its observationally inferred hi volume density and thermal pressure are @xmath271 @xmath5 and @xmath272 @xmath5 k , respectively .",
    "these values are more than two orders of magnitude larger than what is typically expected for the ism , in agreement with previous tsas measurements ( see section 2 ) .",
    "5 .   in terms of hi",
    "mass , tsas contains only @xmath273 earth masses .",
    "this is many orders of magnitude below what is required for gravitationally confined clouds .",
    "6 .   in the shaped tsas model ( heiles et al .",
    "1997 ) tsas could be much colder with a temperature up to a factor of 10 lower than what we have used .",
    "this would reduce the derived @xmath264 and @xmath274 by a factor of 10 , and @xmath275 by a factor of 100 .",
    "if an elongation factor @xmath276 is further introduced , the derived thermal pressure can be brought down to @xmath277 @xmath5 k which is close to the traditional hydrostatic pressure ( with some turbulent contribution ) .",
    "however , this could work only for the case of _ both _ low tsas temperature and significant line - of - sight elongation .    in table",
    "[ t : tsas_upper ] we provide upper limits on tsas properties based on non - detections in the directions of four other pulsars .",
    "in the heiles ( 1997 ) scenario , a typical cnm cloud consists of an inter - tsas medium and many discrete tsas features in the form of cylinders or disks , which are homogeneously and isotropically distributed within the cloud .",
    "an arbitrary line of sight samples many cylinders or disks ; however only cylinders seen end - on or disks seen edge - on have sufficient column densities to produce absorption features recognized as tsas",
    ". meanwhile , non - end - on cylinders or non - edge - on disks have very little column density and blend to form a smooth background which contributes very little to the measured hi absorption profile .",
    "the model assumed the following basic parameters for tsas : a cloud size perpendicular to the line of sight @xmath278 au , @xmath279 k , @xmath280 @xmath29 , and @xmath281 for the number of end - on cylinders or edge - on disks along every line of sight .",
    "two values were considered for @xmath282 , the ratio of the cnm to tsas column density : @xmath283 and 100 .",
    "the model predicts the elongation factor @xmath284 and the volume filling factor @xmath285 of tsas required to ameliorate the over - pressure problem , under the assumption that the asymmetric tsas features are uniformly and isotropically distributed throughout cnm clouds . if tsas is in the form of edge - on disks then @xmath286 and they fill about 3.3% of the cnm volume ;",
    "whereas if tsas is in the form of end - on cylinders then @xmath287 and they fill about 3.6% of the cnm volume .",
    "however , the volume filling factor of tsas is directly proportional to the number of end - on cylinders or edge - on disks @xmath288 along any line of sight .    if we assume @xmath289 k for our tsas detections , a geometric factor @xmath290 is required to explain the observed tsas volume density and pressure within the context of the heiles model .",
    "this is in the range proposed by heiles ( 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the tsas hi column density as well as the @xmath282 ratio are similar to values explored in the model .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to compare our estimated volume filling factor of tsas with the model predicted values .    in the case of b1929 + 10 , as the pulsar moves through the ism our hi absorption spectra have essentially sampled a one - dimensional cut across the absorbing cnm cloud ( about 50 au long ) and detected at least two tsas features .",
    "this means that a one - dimensional covering fraction of tsas in this direction is at least 40% , if we assume a 10au plane - of - sky tsas size . we can now estimate the fraction of the line of sight occupied by tsas .",
    "we first estimate the line - of - sight size of the parent cnm cloud .",
    "as this cloud has @xmath291 @xmath29 ( from table  [ t : table_wnm_cnm ] ) , and if we assume a cnm volume density of 100 @xmath5 , this results in a length of about @xmath292 au . assuming a cylindrical tsas with a 10au plane - of - sky size and a geometrical elongation @xmath293 , results in the volume filling factor of @xmath294% in the direction of b1929 + 10 .",
    "the volume filling factor in the case of other pulsars in our experiment is zero .",
    "we note that our sensitivity for b0823 + 26 and b1133 + 16 is equally good as for b1929 + 10 , and all three pulsars probe interstellar environments with a similar optical depth ( peak of @xmath295 , see figures 1 and 2 ) and a similar line - of - sight length . in a similarly sensitive experiment",
    ", @xcite had 18 observing epochs for one pulsar , about 150 trials , and _ no _ detections .",
    "the observationally inferred volume filling factor of tsas in the direction of our pulsars ( 0 or @xmath294% ) is lower than the model prediction ( @xmath296% ) .",
    "more importantly , we observe significant inhomogeneity in the galactic distribution of tsas : no detections toward four pulsars , and a high detection rate toward b1929 + 10 . for the heiles ( 1997 )",
    "model to remain viable , our observations require inclusion of the possibility of different tsas properties ( specifically @xmath91 , @xmath284 and @xmath288 ) along different lines of sight , and/or additional local physical processes which can modify the tsas production rate .",
    "for example , a highly elongated tsas with @xmath91 a million times smaller than the size of its parent cnm cloud would theoretically result in a volume filling factor close to zero .",
    "while in principle this scenario could work , we are still left with the puzzle of what physical processes can produce such tiny clouds and at the same time greatly vary cloud properties across the ism .",

    "we are left with the conclusion that tsas is a sporadic phenomenon .",
    "it is interesting to note that the smallest spatial scale of tsas detections in both interferometric and b1929 + 10 studies is @xmath330 au . two pulsars ( b2016 + 28 and b0329 + 54 ) have probed scales @xmath331 au , however tsas was not detected .",
    "the spatial scales of @xmath330 au for tsas in the cnm are especially interesting , since in the case of hydrodynamic turbulence the cut - off scale of cnm turbulence corresponds to the viscous damping scale of @xmath332 au @xcite . however , in the case of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence , the turbulent spectrum can cascade below the viscous cut - off scale down to the scale set by magnetic diffusion @xcite . in fact ,",
    "magnetic and kinetic spectra can be greatly decoupled , with the magnetic spectrum being much shallower than the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "our pulsar experiment shows only a few significant tsas detections , all in the direction of one pulsar  b1929 + 10 .",
    "this result strongly suggests inhomogeneity in the galactic distribution of tsas .",
    "we have examined two proposed origins of tsas  ( i ) discrete hi blobs elongated along the line of sight ; and ( ii ) fluctuations at the tail - end of the turbulent cnm spectrum ; but our data do not provide support for either of these models .",
    "the principal problem is that we do not find these features to be homogeneously distributed .",
    "meanwhile , recent numerical simulations do generate cnm clouds with a wide range of physical properties , including rare examples of very dense and over - pressured tsas - like clouds ; but the direct comparison between observations and simulated data is not straightforward since simulations probe much smaller ism regions on scales somewhat larger than these experiments .    the most striking result from our examination of specific lines of sight is a possible correlation between the b1929 + 10 fluctuations and nai interstellar clouds inside the local cavity or at the lb wall . as about one - half of b1929 + 10 s line of sight is associated with the lb , and a significant fraction of this length appears to be traversing the lb wall , we suggest that the observed hi absorption fluctuations are most likely sampling small - scale structure in the lb .",
    "numerous observations have indicated that the lb wall is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "many interstellar cloudlets found inside the local cavity are thought to be caused by hydrodynamic instabilities fragmenting the lb wall . through various studies",
    ", it has been shown that these cloudlets have velocities of up to 25  relative to the sun @xcite .",
    "this translates to @xmath333 au yr@xmath0 .",
    "coupled with the transverse speed of b1929 + 10 of 37 au yr@xmath0 , this suggests that our observed tsas could result from the pulsar s line of sight crossing very local cloudlets .",
    "to investigate the origin of interstellar clouds inside the local cavity , we look to 2d hydrodynamical simulations of the wnm compression by supernova explosions and subsequent fragmentation into small clouds @xcite .",
    "they showed that within 0.3 myr a thermally collapsing layer is formed behind the ( supernova ) shock front where cooling dominates heating and temperature monotonically decreases .",
    "as the gas cools it becomes thermally unstable , with a temperature in the range of 300 - 6000 k. within @xmath11 myr this layer starts to fragment into many small ( @xmath334 pc ) cloudlets .",
    "finally , these cloudlets can even reach thermal equilibrium at a temperature of 20 k and density of 2000 @xmath5 . as the ism is frequently compressed by supernova explosions , fragmentation of the shock - compressed medium",
    "can provide a mechanism for the formation of many small cloudlets .    in the @xcite simulation ,",
    "the cloudlets become embedded in the hot high - pressure gas as the shocked layer fragments , leading to a situation similar to what is observed in the lb .",
    "the exact temperature inside the local cavity has been uncertain ( see @xcite for references ) , however it is clear that the cavity is occupied by a warm / hot ionized medium .",
    "the cold cloudlets will eventually evaporate in the surrounding warm / hot medium .",
    "this process has been studied by many authors .",
    "the mass - loss rate in the case of classic evaporation @xcite is slightly lower when cooling is included @xcite .",
    "the mass - loss rate of @xcite who considered both flux saturation effects and radiative cooling is about 100 times lower than the classic evaporation rate .",
    "we continue by assuming the lowest suggested mass - loss rate , which will have the gentlest effect on the cold clouds .",
    "the evaporation timescale depends greatly on the cloud size and the temperature of the surrounding medium . for a cloud size of 30 au ,",
    "@xmath335 - @xmath336 yr , depending upon whether the cloud is surrounded by the hot ionized medium ( him ) or wnm . for a larger cloud with a size of @xmath337 au , @xmath338 ( him ) or",
    "10@xmath339 ( wim ) yr . clearly larger clouds survive longer and can even coalesce to build larger structures , even if surrounded by a hot medium . in about 1 myr",
    "larger clouds could cross a large distance , @xmath332 pc , and may even escape outside of the lb into the ism through various chimneys and tunnels resulting from stellar winds and supernovae , and frequently observed in expanding shells .",
    "this scenario may be able to explain the existence of hi clouds on scales of thousands of au or more in the ism , as observed recently by @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , very small clouds will evaporate quickly and therefore may not be common in the ism .",
    "their short inferred lifetimes indicate that they would usually be found close to their formation sites .",
    "we have used the arecibo telescope to obtain multi - epoch hi absorption spectra in the direction of six bright pulsars , with the goal of searching for structure on au scales in the cnm .",
    "our target sources were observed previously by frail et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who found pervasive tiny - scale hi structure .",
    "we used an advanced spectrometer capable of more accurate measurements in the face of wildly fluctuating pulsar signals , and carefully analyzed noise statistics . to search for variability of hi absorption profiles , which signifies inhomogeneities on au scales in the cnm ,",
    "we have searched for time - variability of the absorption line equivalent widths and of the absorption spectra themselves . while we had excellent sensitivity , significant variations in both ew and absorption spectra",
    "have been found only in the case of one pulsar : b1929 + 10 .",
    "these variations imply tsas on spatial scales @xmath340 au ( where @xmath267 is the distance to the tsas feature ) , with an inferred volume density of @xmath341 @xmath5 and thermal pressure of @xmath342 @xmath5 k.    our study clearly shows the inhomogeneity in the galactic distribution of tsas : the detection rate toward four of our pulsars is zero , while the detection rate toward b1929 + 10 is high .",
    "such inhomogeneity is hard to explain with the model of discrete elongated disks or cylinders being a _ general _ property of cnm clouds ( heiles 1997 ) ; instead large spatial variations of tsas physical properties or abundances must be invoked . while the heiles ( 1997 ) model can help in bringing down the volume density and pressure of tsas , the puzzles regarding its distribution and origin still remain .",
    "our examination of all pulsar and interferometric tsas detections and upper limits does not show a correlation between the level of optical depth fluctuations and the tsas spatial scale , as would be expected if the turbulent spectrum on much larger scales is extrapolated to au - scales .",
    "the detections and non - detections probe an almost continuous range of spatial scales from @xmath343 to 1000 au .",
    "therefore , the large number of non - detections of tsas suggests that the cnm clouds on scales @xmath344 to @xmath336 au are not a pervasive property of the ism .",
    "the sporadic tsas detections on scales of tens of au may indicate occasional local bursts of turbulent energy dissipation , rather than end - points of the turbulent spectrum .",
    "another striking result from our study is a possible correlation between b1929 + 10 s tsas and interstellar clouds observed in nai absorption inside the local bubble .",
    "we find evidence that the tsas is likely to be within 106 pc of the sun , and is sampling the small - scale structure of the lb caused by hydrodynamic instabilities fragmenting the lb wall .",
    "we propose that the line of sight of b1929 + 10 is revealing this recently formed small - scale structure .",
    "similar bubbles and their walls are found throughout the milky way , but the lifetime of a tsas cloud created from them depends strongly on the its size and the temperature of the surrounding medium .",
    "larger fragments ( size @xmath345 au ) survive longer and can travel large ism distances , becoming a more general ism property . on the other hand , the smallest clouds ( size",
    "@xmath13 au ) evaporate quickly close to their formation site , and are therefore not very commonly observed in the ism .",
    "additional processes , such as stellar mass - loss and collisions of interstellar clouds / filaments , probably contribute to the cnm structure formation on somewhat larger ( sub - pc ) scales .",

    "<S> these pulsars have swept across 1200 au over the course of our experiment , allowing us to probe the existence and properties of the tiny scale atomic structure ( tsas ) in the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) . </S>",
    "<S> while most of the observed pulsars show no significant change in their hi absorption spectra , we have identified at least two clear tsas - induced opacity variations in the direction of b1929 + 10 . </S>",
    "<S> these observations require strong spatial inhomogeneities in either the tsas clouds physical properties themselves or else in the clouds galactic distribution . </S>",
    "<S> while tsas is occasionally detected on spatial scales down to 10 au , it is too rare to be characterized by a spectrum of turbulent cnm fluctuations on scales of @xmath1 au , as previously suggested by some work . in the direction of b1929 + 10 , </S>",
    "<S> an apparent correlation between tsas and interstellar clouds inside the warm local bubble ( lb ) indicates that tsas may be tracing the fragmentation of the lb wall via hydrodynamic instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> while similar fragmentation events occur frequently throughout the ism , the warm medium surrounding these cold cloudlets induces a natural selection effect wherein small tsas clouds evaporate quickly and are rare , while large clouds survive longer and become a general property of the ism . </S>"
