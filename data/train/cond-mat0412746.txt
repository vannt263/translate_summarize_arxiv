    "the celebrated phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of superconductivity was introduced in the seminal paper by ginzburg and landau @xcite and has been proving ever since to be one of most fruitful and universal tools in the description basic properties of superconductors .",
    "the examples of its success range from the prediction of the abrikosov vortex state @xcite to the recent advance in understanding the complex vortex phase diagram of the high - temperature superconductors @xcite and the properties of mesoscopic superconducting systems @xcite .",
    "the gorkov s derivation of the gl equations from the bcs theory @xcite that have put the gl theory on a firm microscopic basis and related phenomenological constants to material parameters , completed the construction of the gl theory of superconductors .",
    "the gl theory describes well the properties of almost all superconductors near transition temperature and is successful even when dealing with the superconductors with quite complicated band structures .",
    "the notorious exception from the rule is recently discovered multiband superconductor magnesium diboride ( mgb@xmath0 ) .",
    "as it was shown @xcite , the gl theory applies to mgb@xmath1 only in the very immediate vicinity of the transition temperature , @xmath2 , i.e. within the interval which turns out to be much more narrow than the usual one given by the condition @xmath3 .",
    "the origin of this narrowing of the interval of validity lies in the sophisticated band structure of the material and reflects the specific interplay between its single - electron and superconducting characteristics .",
    "namely , the brillouin zone of mgb@xmath1 consists of the two families of bands : the quasi - two - dimensional @xmath4-bands with the strong superconductivity and the weakly superconducting three - dimensional @xmath5-bands . due to the large difference in anisotropy ,",
    "the c - axis coherence length of the @xmath5-bands , @xmath6 , is much larger than the c - axis coherence length of the @xmath4-bands , @xmath7 .",
    "formation of the global coherent superconductivity with the unique order parameter implies the appearance of the associated unique effective coherence length @xmath8 , which turns out to be much smaller than @xmath6 at almost any temperature . as a consequence ,",
    "the gl applicability interval shrinks to the parametrically narrow range of temperatures where @xmath9 . beyond this temperature range",
    "the system is strongly nonlocal along the @xmath10-axis ; to describe such a nonlocality one has to employ a generalized nonlocal gl model @xcite .",
    "one of the spectacular manifestations of the non - gl behavior in mgb@xmath1 is the strong temperature dependence of the @xmath11 anisotropy close to @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the description of superconducting fluctuations is one of the major fields for the application of the gl theory .",
    "since the standard gl approach turns out to be insufficient for mgb@xmath1 , a generalization of the gl theory is required in order to describe its fluctuation properties .",
    "the variation of the order parameter on the scales smaller than the largest intrinsic coherence length means that the usually assumed local approximation does not hold anymore and the corresponding short - wavelength fluctuations have to be taken into account .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a nonlocal theory of superconducting fluctuations that applies to a strongly anisotropic two - band superconductor @xcite and show that the short - wavelength fluctuations are essential in it near the critical temperature .",
    "we start with the derivation of the microscopic fluctuation propagator for a such two - band model",
    ". then we use it to nonlocal two - band gl functional and the corresponding time - dependent gl ( tdgl ) equations .",
    "this , in particular , allows us to calculate the kinetic and thermodynamic observable quantities including the fluctuational specific heat and conductivity .    as we have already stated , the main source of the non - gl behavior is the nonlocality in the @xmath12 direction , i.e. , the strong wave - vector dependence of c - axis coherence length .",
    "the conventional local form of the gl equations turns out to be valid only within the narrow interval of temperatures , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the relative interband interaction constant which will be specified below . beyond this interval ,",
    "the superconducting correlations in the @xmath5-band become nonlocal and their contribution to the effective coherence length rapidly decreases . far away from @xmath15 the effective c - axis coherence length",
    "is determined only by the @xmath4-band . in other words ,",
    "the effective c - axis coherence diverges for @xmath16 faster than it could be expected from the naive gl extrapolation , @xmath17 , started from high temperatures .",
    "this also leads to the decrease of the effective anisotropy factor @xmath18 . as a consequence , the temperatures dependencies of all fluctuation corrections exhibit the characteristic crossovers between the dominating @xmath4-band regime ( far away from @xmath15 ) and the `` true '' gl regime ( very close to @xmath15 ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath12-axis component of the paraconductivity diverges faster in the immediate vicinity of @xmath15 than one could expect from high - temperature extrapolation using the aslamazov - larkin formula @xcite while the fluctuation specific heat and @xmath19 component of the paraconductivity diverge slower than the corresponding extrapolations .",
    "we will obtain the temperature dependencies of these fluctuation corrections .",
    "the bcs theory was generalized to the case of the two - band electron spectrum long time ago @xcite and has been extended recently to include the specific features of magnesium diboride in refs .  .",
    "we briefly overview this theory rewriting it in terms of green s function formalism .",
    "the two - band bcs hamiltonian is given by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the creation and annihilation field operators in the heisenberg representation for quasiparticle in band @xmath23 with momentum @xmath24 and spin @xmath4 , @xmath25 is the quasiparticle spectrum , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the fermi velocity and momentum of the @xmath23-band .",
    "the matrix nature of the electron - electron interaction @xmath28 in ( [ bcsham ] ) reflects the possibility of the interband interactions .",
    "the free electron green s functions for each band have the usual form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the time - ordering operator . in the matsubara representation , @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the fermionic matsubara frequencies .",
    "now we turn to calculation of the fluctuation propagator @xmath33 which characterizes the properties of fluctuation cooper pairs and their effect on observable quantities of superconductor above @xmath2.@xcite note first of all , that the interband electron interactions do not result in the cooper pairing of the electrons from different bands but rather lead to the transfer of the pairing correlations between the bands .",
    "indeed , the cooper pairing means the appearance of superconducting - type correlations between two similar states obeying the condition of the time reversal symmetry .",
    "this means that pairing is possible only for electrons belonging to the same band , otherwise the electron states are too diverse ( in terms of the plane waves description , their momenta are not the opposite ) and the integral of the product of their wave functions is zero .",
    "thus the formation of unique condensate should be understood as the result of the _ intraband _ electron correlations and subsequent travelof the cooper pair from one band to another due to off - diagonal interaction components @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "hence , in terms of diagrams , the entrance and exit lines of the fluctuation propagator must belong to the same bands ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - dyson ] ) and it can be presented as the @xmath36 matrix @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the bosonic matsubara frequencies . the corresponding dyson equation for fluctuation propagator can be written in the ladder approximation as ( see fig .  [ fig - dyson ] ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the matrix polarization operator which is determined by two green s functions loop @xcite . without interband electron scattering",
    "the only nonzero components of the operator @xmath33 are the diagonal ones .    ) for the fluctuation propagator @xmath33 ( wavy line ) .",
    "the greek letters indicate the band indices .",
    "the black dot represents the coupling - constants matrix @xmath28 , the loop represents the polarization operator @xmath41 , and the shaded triangle represents the scattering vertex @xmath42.,width=326 ]    turning to the role of electron scattering , let us note that at the first sight the short - range impurity potential might lead to the scattering of electrons all over the whole fermi surface which would result in the equalization of all gap values and reduction of @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is well established now that this does not happen in mgb@xmath0 : even in the samples with rather strong intraband scattering , interband scattering remains rather weak .",
    "this property gave possibility to fabricate samples with very high upper critical fields ( up to 50 tesla ) which have transition temperatures only slightly smaller than clean material@xcite .",
    "weakness of the interband scattering has been explained by mazin _",
    "_ in ref .   who argued that different parity symmetry of the @xmath4- and @xmath5- orbitals leads to strong reduction of the impurity scattering matrix element between these bands . for simplicity",
    ", we will completely neglect the interband scattering . in this case",
    "the off - diagonal components of the polarization operator vanish .",
    "the averaging over impurities position will result just in the usual renormalization of the green s functions : @xmath43 ( @xmath44  is the corresponding intraband scattering time ) and to the appearance of the scattering vertex part @xmath45 in the expression for the polarization operator    @xmath46    the scattering vertex part can be calculated in the ladder approximation@xcite . in the case of a dirty metal @xmath47 this gives@xcite @xmath48 leading to the following result for the polarization operator @xmath49   , \\label{polar_expl}%\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the density of states in the band @xmath23 , @xmath51 is the debye frequency and @xmath52 is the digamma - function .",
    "we introduced above the notation for the diffusion - coefficient tensor acting in the momentum and band spaces : @xmath53 the diffusivities @xmath54 determine the band coherence lengths as @xmath55 . for magnesium",
    "diboride the ratio @xmath56 is large , @xmath57 , due to the large difference between the band fermi velocities in the @xmath12 direction @xcite .",
    "this parameter will play an important role in the following consideration .",
    "the inversion of the dyson equation ( [ dyson1 ] ) gives @xmath58 we will use now this general expression to reconsider the main properties of two - band superconductivity and to describe the corresponding fluctuation properties .      the critical temperature of a two - band superconductor is determined by the condition @xmath59 taken at @xmath60 and @xmath61 : @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the euler constant .",

    "the important feature of our approach is that the derived _ nonlocal _ gl functional takes into account not only the long - wavelength fluctuations ( as is the case of the conventional gl theory ) , but also the short - wavelength fluctuations , which enables to significantly extend the range of validity of the gl technique .",
    "this approach not only permits the study of the thermodynamic characteristics of the superconductors , but provides a convenient technique for calculation of transport coefficients .",
    "it is necessary to underline that we succeeded to solve analytically the problem of accounting for short - wavelength fluctuations due to the specific for our model large difference in the intra - band diffusion coefficients @xmath254 .",
    "fortunately , this assumption corresponds to the practically interesting case of magnesium diboride .",
    "one can see that the main qualitative effect that determines the unusual behavior of fluctuations in the anisotropic two - band model consists in globalization of superconductivity in the immediate vicinity of transition temperature ( @xmath255 ) .",
    "it occurs due to the possibility for electrons of both bands to participate in fluctuation pairing and to exchange of fluctuation pairs between them .",

    "the crossover between these two 3d regimes occurs in the narrow interval of temperatures @xmath261 where the boson degrees of freedom corresponding to the pairings in @xmath5-band rapidly freeze out , leading to the fast decrease ( @xmath262 ) of @xmath10-axis paraconductivity .",
    "we want to stress that this temperature dependence appears due to the noticeable contribution of short - wavelength fluctuations in this range of temperatures .    in the case of the in - plane component of paraconductivity and the fluctuation part of heat capacity , the situation is the opposite .",
    "the coherence length @xmath263 appears in the denominator of the corresponding expressions , so @xmath211 and @xmath264 turn out to be suppressed in the vicinity of transition with respect to their extrapolation formulas from the high - temperature behavior .",
    "similar situation occurs in the temperature dependencies of the in - plane upper critical field and of anisotropy of the upper critical field @xcite .",
    "the obtained results coincide with that ones of the diagrammatic approach but the proposed gl description has an advantage of being more physically transparent , economic , and universal . the fact that the results derived via the gl equations coincide with those of our microscopic consideration is a convincing cross - check of the phenomenological description .",
