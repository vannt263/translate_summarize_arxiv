    "the signal available at the output of a radio measurement system is never an entirely accurate indicator of the quantity to be measured .",
    "the accuracy of the measurement depends on the amount of noise compared to the level of signal , or signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "signal noise can result from a variety of causes , both man - made and natural . in most cases , however , it is natural additive noise which is the limiting factor for signal detection .",
    "this may include noise radiation from the sky picked up at the antenna , johnson - nyquist noise and shot noise generated in the circuitry of the receiver , etc .",
    "usually the natural additive noise can be represented mathematically as a gaussian random process , hence the term gaussian noise .",
    "the problems of detecting signals in gaussian noise and of estimating parameters of signals in gaussian noise have been studied by means of detection theory .",
    "there exists an extensive literature on this subject ( see , for example , @xcite for review ) .",
    "our interest in the statistics of random signals in gaussian noise arose from measurements of electromagnetic waves transmitted through random media .",
    "wave transport in the presence of disorder can be characterized by the degree of nonlocal intensity correlation , which reflects the closeness to the anderson localization transition ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of long - range correlation of intensity within a sample leads to enhanced fluctuations of total transmission over the value predicted if correlation of intensity were short range , as is correlation of the field .",
    "the occurrence of enhanced transmission fluctuations can be seen in an ensemble of quasi-1d random samples , in which the sample length is much greater than the diameter of its cross section @xcite . in pulsed transmission measurements , the variance of transmission fluctuations normalized to the ensemble - averaged transmission increases with time delay from an exciting pulse @xcite while the decay rate of the average intensity within the sample decreases @xcite , reflecting two related effects : the increasing impact of localization and the growing weight of long - lived electromagnetic quasi - modes . at long times , however , the decaying transmitted intensity becomes comparable to gaussian noise then affecting the intensity statistics so that the measured variance of total transmission is no longer the localization parameter . to study the dynamics of transport at long time delays ,",
    "the impact of gaussian noise must therefore be determined .    to solve this problem",
    ", we consider the model of a random signal plus noise in which noise is represented by a random phasor sum with circular gaussian statistics .",
    "we find that the addition of complex - valued gaussian noise results in a bessel transform of the probability density of the signal intensity .",
    "depending on the physical problem under consideration , the solution can be used to find the intensity statistics of signal in the presence of gaussian noise , to retrieve the intensity statistics of signal from gaussian noise given the noise intensity , or to determine the noise intensity given the intensity distribution of the signal .",
    "we shall use it to determine the probability density of pulsed transmitted intensity in gaussian noise at long time delays .",
    "more generally , the solution can be applied to a mixture of independent random signals , one of which being a complex - valued gaussian random process .",
    "an important example is the stationary field of a disordered cavity coupled to the environment , which can be represented by superposition of a standing wave ( an eigenstate ) and a traveling wave associated with the energy leaking out of the system @xcite , the former playing the role of ` signal ' and the latter playing the role of ` gaussian noise ' .",
    "we consider the model of a random signal plus gaussian noise , @xmath0 , in which gaussian noise , @xmath1 , is represented by a random phasor sum with circular gaussian statistics @xcite .",
    "the probability density of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , is a gaussian with width @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the moments , @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the average over an ensemble of realizations .",
    "because @xmath8 and @xmath1 are statistically independent , the probability density of the resultant field @xmath9 is simply the convolution , @xmath10 .",
    "finding statistics of the intensity of the resultant field , @xmath11 , however , is more involved .",
    "the gaussian statistics of @xmath2 and @xmath3 results into the exponential probability density of the noise intensity , @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the average noise intensity that we shall denote by @xmath15 .",
    "the moments of the noise intensity follow from ( 3 ) as @xmath16 .",
    "the signal intensity , @xmath17 , can be written as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the moments of @xmath17 are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the probability density of the signal intensity .    to find the probability density of the intensity of the resultant field ,",
    "we first calculate its moments @xmath23 . expressing @xmath24 in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the signal and noise , taking the average and using ( 2 ) , we arrive at @xmath25 from ( 5 ) , the average and the variance are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .    from the moments",
    "@xmath23 the characteristic function and probability density of @xmath28 can be obtained @xcite . here",
    "these are derived using the characteristic function @xmath29 of the signal intensity @xmath17 , @xmath30 the moments @xmath31 can be deduced from ( 5 ) and written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the laguerre polynomial of order @xmath34 . substituting ( 7 ) into ( 6 ) and by making use of a generating function of laguerre polynomials @xcite , we obtain @xmath35 by changing variables , @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( 8) can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the characteristic function of the intensity @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath39 is related to @xmath38 in the usual way , @xmath40 substituting @xmath38 of ( 9 ) into ( 10 ) , we obtain @xmath41 changing the order of integration and integrating over @xmath42 , we arrive at @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a modified bessel function of the first kind of zero order .",
    "( 12 ) is the main result of the paper and represents the transformation of the probability density of the signal intensity in the presence of gaussian noise with the average intensity @xmath15 .",
    "some examples are in order . for a constant signal with intensity @xmath45 , for which @xmath46",
    ", we obtain from ( 12 ) @xmath47 which is in agreement with the result of the model of a constant phasor plus a random phasor sum @xcite . in the case when @xmath8 is itself a random phasor sum , @xmath48 .",
    "then , as may be expected , eq .  ( 12 ) yields @xmath49 , where @xmath26 . finally , in the case of a disordered cavity in the absence of non - proportional damping @xcite , @xmath50 , which is the porter - thomas distribution @xcite .",
    "we then obtain from ( 12 ) the probability density , @xmath51 , in the crossover from closed to open system , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "the equation ( 12 ) can be inverted to yield the probability density of the signal intensity , @xmath54 however , eq .  ( 15 ) is not particularly useful to retrieve @xmath22 from gaussian noise with the average intensity @xmath15 , because it requires a continuation of @xmath39 to negative @xmath28 , which is not available from the measurement .",
    "instead , @xmath22 can be found by solving the equation ( 12 ) . in the next section",
    ", we determine the probability density of pulsed transmitted intensity in gaussian noise at long time delays .",
    "here the results of statistical model of the previous section are used to retrieve the intensity statistics of pulsed microwave transmission through random media from gaussian noise at long delay times @xcite .",
    "accurate measurements of the time - resolved statistics of pulsed transmission are absolutely essential for systematic study of wave transport in the presence of disorder .",
    "spectral measurements of the field transmission coefficient of microwave radiation were made in an ensemble of random dielectric samples , as described in @xcite .",
    "the response to a pulse with a gaussian temporal envelope at carrier frequency @xmath55 is obtained by fourier transforming the product of the field transmission spectrum and a gaussian spectral function of width @xmath56 .",
    "the field of the temporal response is squared to give the intensity @xmath57 for each sample configuration . the average intensity @xmath58 is found by averaging over the ensemble of realizations .",
    "the result is shown on a logarithmic scale as the black solid line in fig .",
    "the noise in the transmitted field manifests itself as a constant background in fig .",
    "1a . the analysis of the probability density @xmath59 in the negative time before the pulse , i.e. , when @xmath60 , shows that @xmath61 is a circular gaussian .",
    "the average pulsed transmitted intensity @xmath62 is then @xmath63 , where @xmath15 is the constant background in fig .",
    "once this background is subtracted ( blue dashed line ) , the dynamic range is significantly enhanced .",

    "the variance of normalized transmitted intensity is expected to increase with time delay from an exciting pulse @xcite as increasingly more of energy within the medium is stored in long - lived localized modes . in fig .",
    "1b , in contrast , the variance of normalized intensity falls at long times to a value of unity , reflecting the increasing impact of gaussian noise .",
    "the variance of transmitted intensity follows from ( 7 ) as @xmath66=\\text{var}[i(t)]-2\\langle i(t)\\rangle d+d^2 $ ] . the evolution with time of the normalized variance , @xmath67 $ ] , is shown as the blue dashed line in fig .",

    ", the probability distribution of the transmitted intensity is increasingly affected by gaussian noise at long times .",

    "are shown as the black solid curves in fig .  2 .",

    "apart from the uppermost curve , each of the curves is displaced by a multiple of two decades for clarity of presentation . in order to find the probability density @xmath72 , eq .",

    "however , the form of @xmath72 is already known @xcite ,    , 364 , and 389 ns , and in the negative time ( @xmath71 ns ) , indicated by the vertical dashed lines in fig .  1",
