    "our aim is to improve belief propagation  ( bp ) decoding methods so that quantum coding is dramatically improved over existing techniques .",
    "specifically our numerical results presented here show that an improved bp method whose heuristical feedback strategies based on exploiting all accessible information from stabilizer measurements , yield a dramatically improved block error rate  ( ber ) for any depolarizing channel .",

    "generally , sparse quantum codes are decoded by using syndrome - based bp decoding algorithms which automatically imply hard - decision decoding .",
    "though there is an equivalence between syndrome - based decoding and a posteriori probability decoding ( signal - based decoding ) under this setting , the syndrome - based decoding results in a serious drawback to bp decoder : the symmetric degeneracy error  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , poulin and chung  ( pc08 )  @xcite propose a solution to the symmetric degeneracy error by using the random perturbation method .",
    "motivated by the soft - decision techniques used in classical settings , which provide extra reliable information on the message nodes thereby yielding a better error correcting capacity  @xcite , we develop a new heuristical feedback adjustment strategy for the standard bp decoder .",
    "when used in decoding sparse quantum codes , our method can on one hand solve the symmetric degeneracy error problem , and on the other hand can provide more useful information to the message nodes .",
    "the difference between pc08 and our approach is that , in pc08 , they feed back only the syndrome of the decoder output to adjust prior error probability distributions for received qubits .",
    "these adjusted distributions are then fed back into the decoder .",
    "we significantly improve this protocol by feeding back not just the syndrome but also the values of the frustrated checks on individual qubits of the code and the channel model ; accordingly we introduce a new adjustment strategy .",
    "specifically , our approach , which is based not only on syndromes but also on frustrated checks obtained from full stabilizer measurements and the channel model , yields a better ber for the case of depolarizing quantum channels .",
    "we provide a detailed description of our basic bp decoder for decoding sparse quantum codes .",
    "the basic bp decoder introduced here is inspired by the strategy used for decoding sparse classical quaternary codes under the bp algorithm . using this strategy",

    "in this section , we briefly reprise the essential elements of bp iterative decoding for sparse quantum codes . in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : bpdecoding ] we discuss the key idea of standard bp iterative algorithms .",

    "consider a @xmath9-bit message that is encoded into an @xmath0-bit codeword , which is then transmitted through a noisy channel .",
    "the received message is an error - prone vector over the output alphabet , and there is no guarantee that decoding will reveal the original codeword .",
    "however , the codeword can be guessed with a high probability of being correct by maximizing the probability for this codeword based on the observed output vector  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately for a linear block code , encoding  @xmath9 information bits into @xmath0 bits allows @xmath10 possible @xmath0-bit codewords , and calculating conditional probabilities for individual codewords is too expensive in practice .",
    "bp algorithms overcome this inefficiency for sparse codes  @xcite .",
    "the strategy is to represent a linear - block classical error - correcting code ( cecc ) by a tanner graph comprising message nodes and check nodes corresponding respectively to received bits and check constraints .",

    "the probabilities from @xmath11 to @xmath12 are computed based on the observed value of the message node and other probabilities passed from the neighboring check nodes to the respective message node .",
    "it turns out that , for decoding sparse codes , the bp algorithm can provide a reasonable trade - off between complexity and performance .    for a linear block cecc",
    ", the code space can be viewed as the orthogonal projection space  ( solution space ) of its check matrix . the sender alice transmits her message as a codeword that is encoded according to a specific check  ( or generator ) matrix through the channel .",
    "when receiver bob obtains the channel output , the received vector may not be the solution vector of the check matrix .",
    "therefore bob needs to apply a smart algorithm to recover the codeword efficiently . as",
    "the check matrix is sparse , bob employs the bp algorithm .",
    "first , bob measures each bit to obtain its posterior probability distribution .",
    "subsequently , he puts these probabilities into the bp decoder , and , based on the constraint that the codeword should be the orthogonal vector of the check matrix , he infers the original message .",
    "this procedure extends naturally to sparse quantum codes .    in the quantum case ,",
    "the stabilizer formalism for a quantum error - correcting code  ( qecc ) is useful .",

    "( [ eq : paulinoisechannel ] ) has occurred based on the noise model and the syndrome , which is effectively a check constraint .",
    "bob redresses the error by applying the same error operation he inferred onto his received codeword to try to recover the quantum code . for pauli channels all errors are @xmath0-fold tensor products of single - qubit pauli operators",
    "hence square to the identity ; thus re - applying the same error should restore the original codeword .    due to the close analogy between ceccs and qeccs as discussed above , it is tempting to extend the bp iterative decoding algorithm to quantum settings .",
    "in fact a qecc can also be represented by a decorated tanner graph  @xcite .",

    "our strategy retains pc08 s capability of breaking the symmetric degeneracy while feeding back more useful information to the bp decoder than pc08 in order to help the decoder determine a valid output .",
    "more useful information comes from retaining full information about the entire stabilizer rather than just a syndrome .",
    "specifically , our feedback adjustment strategy is not solely based on the syndrome but also on the channel model and on the individual values of the entries of the frustrated checks  ( the checks are just the generators of the stabilizer ) .",

    "notably , interesting results appear in the decoding of ea-3 . from fig .  [",
    "fig : eaexample3 ] and  [ fig : averageiteration2 ] we see that pc08 could not significantly improve the standard bp decoder even with high anoi , yet our approach does improve the performance of ea-3 significantly with almost the same anoi as the standard bp decoder excepting the last two nodes .",
    "our algorithm is capable of turning the detectable errors into new outputs whose syndromes are identical with corresponding observed syndromes . we refer to these outputs as _ valid _ outputs can be classified into three cases : ( 1 ) @xmath229 ; ( 2 ) @xmath230 but @xmath231 ; ( 3 ) @xmath232 .",

    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : conventional - proportion ] that most of the detected errors will be turned to correct output but not un - detected errors by using our enhanced feedback bp decoder .",
    "in fact we can take the percentage of detected  ( pod ) errors as an important parameter to appraise the decoding capacity of the decoder , since one detected error indicates a failure of the decoder and undetected errors can be viewed as fundamental limitations of the code in some sense . here",
    "we take the ea-1 as an example and suppose this time  @xmath233 . in this case",
    "our simulation reveals that standard bp decoder fails @xmath234 times when it has simulated @xmath235 blocks , and the number of detected error is @xmath198 so pod@xmath236 .",

    "on the other hand , our enhanced feedback bp decoder fails @xmath234 times for a simulation of @xmath239 blocks , and only @xmath240 errors are attributed to detected errors so pod=@xmath241 .",
    "the pod in our case is much less than for the other two bp decoders .",
    "we have developed an enhanced feedback bp decoding algorithm whose feedback adjustment strategy is not based solely on the syndrome but also on the channel model and on the individual values of the entries of the frustrated checks .",
    "our approach retains the capability of breaking the symmetric degeneracy while also feeding back extra useful information to the bp decoder .",
    "therefore , our feedback adjustment strategy yields a better error correcting capacity with relative less iterations compared to the proposed decoding algorithms for sparse quantum codes . we have considered three cases : the standard bp decoder adapted from classical decoding to decode quantum codes , the superior bp decoder with poulin and chung s random perturbation  @xcite , and the bp decoder with our new feedback adjustment strategy introduced here .",
    "we used the @xmath8 representation of quantum codes to construct our feedback - based algorithm and exploit not just the syndrome but all the measurement resulting from stabilizer measurements .",
    "then we used the block error rate  ( ber ) and average number of iterations ( anoi ) to demonstrate a dramatic better error correcting capacity improvement with relative less iterations .",
    "this result was achieved using new feedback adjustment strategy vs the two alternatives : standard bp decoder and the bp decoder with random perturbation .",
    "as shown in section  v , the net rate for ea-2 and ea-3 are 0 and @xmath242 respectively .",
    "as pointed out by brun , devetak and hsieh ,  in general , net rates for ea quantum codes can be positive , negative , or zero .",
    "the zero rate does not mean that no qubits are transmitted by this code !",
    "rather , it implies that a number of bits of entanglement is needed that is equal to the number of bits transmitted . \"",
    "compared to quantum codes with high net rates , ea quantum codes with zero or negative net rates employ many more physical qubits including a great number of bits of entanglement that being assumed to be error - free , thus these codes can tolerate stronger noise .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that ea-2 and ea-3 greatly increase @xmath4 the cross - over probability of depolarizing channel when compared to quantum codes with similar code length and higher net rates .    for comparison , based on  construction b \"  @xcite ( same as the construction of conventional ) , we construct a quantum code with a similar code length as ea-2 but having a relative higher net rate .",

    "[ fig : ex ] , we see that ex has comparable ber performance to other examples presented in existing literatures which have similar parameters as ex but significantly worse than ea-2 .     for the standard bp decoder and for our algorithm when applied to ex .",
