    "there has been considerable study of correlation functions in high energy and nuclear physics . however , with the exception of source size measurements using identical particle ( hanbury  brown / twiss ) interferometry [ [ rhbt ] ] , the connection between measurements of correlation functions and the physics of particle collisions is tenuous .",
    "for example , it is possible to measure the size of correlation sources ( the number of pions produced ) in high energy collisions [ [ rsizes ] ] , but no other source characteristics are currently identifiable .",
    "this is unfortunate , as the source size is anomalously large in ultra ",
    "relativistic nuclear collisions [ [ rsizes ] , [ ranom ] ] ( the sources decay into at least fifteen pions each [ [ rdrops ] ] ) , and the nature of these sources has not yet been determined .    in this article , we propose to measure the velocities of correlation sources , the objects that make up the intermediate structure of collisions , by using the rapidity , @xmath2 , and azimuthal angle , @xmath3 , correlation functions [ [ rsfms ] ] @xmath4 and @xmath5 where measurements are made over a window from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an integer multiple of @xmath11 .",
    "bin correlation functions are useful for measuring correlations with maximum statistics ( without re  use of data ) .",
    "@xmath0 is closely related to the standard two  particle correlation function : @xmath12 for large @xmath10 , the correlation functions are almost independent of @xmath10 , but in practice it is impossible to make correlation measurements in particle collisions without using a large bin for reference , as the amount of produced matter fluctuates from event to event . the proposed technique is to measure the ratio @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the single  particle distributions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the case of a flat distribution [ @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "it is also possible to measure emission velocities using standard two  particle interferometry techniques ; however , these measurements are somewhat more difficult than the technique proposed here , as they require particle identification .",
    "the technique proposed here has the advantage of being useable even in the absence of particle identification .",
    "we assume isotropic emission and show that , in the non  relativistic limit , @xmath20 depends only on the velocity ratio , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the source transverse velocity , and @xmath23 is the velocity of emitted particles in the source rest frame . in section  [ stpd ] , we calculate @xmath20 for the case of a resonance that decays isotropically into two particles . in section  [ sts ] , we calculate @xmath20 for isotropic decay of a thermal source , finding that the shape is not very different from the first case .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and discuss applications and future work in section  [ sc ] .",
    "suppose that we have an event with a single resonance that decays into two particles , and a flat background of @xmath24 particles in a window of rapidity @xmath10 .",
    "the background contribution to the two  particle density is then constant : @xmath25 adding the contribution from combining one background particle with one particle from the resonance , we obtain the total uncorrelated signal , @xmath26 \\ , / \\ , ( 4 \\ , \\pi^2 \\ , \\delta y^2)~. \\label{er2u}\\ ] ]    given the resonance azimuthal angle , @xmath27 , and the resonance rapidity , @xmath28 , we calculate the laboratory coordinates , @xmath2 and @xmath29 , as functions of the center - of - momentum coordinates , @xmath30 and @xmath3 .",

    "the resonance contribution to @xmath38 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 as we assume flat distributions , the contribution from all bins is the same , so we use only the bin from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , and take @xmath43 the contribution at @xmath44 is @xmath45 } { \\displaystyle \\delta y^2 \\ , \\left[n \\ , ( n-1 ) \\ , - \\ , 2\\right ] \\ , \\left [ ( 1-v_s^2)^{1/2 } \\ , v_{\\pi } \\right ] } , \\label{es2d } \\\\",

    "in fact , @xmath20 is even independent of the number of sources , as before",
    ".    we can not evaluate the relativistic denominator for the thermal source , but we can take the non  relativistic limit as before .",
    "we obtain @xmath77 where @xmath78 it is again clear that , in the non  relativistic limit , @xmath20 depends only on @xmath79 .    in fig .  2",
    ", we display @xmath20 as in the case of two  particle decay .",
    "we find now that @xmath80 and @xmath81 , so the normalization is clearly different from that obtained for two  particle decay .",
    "because the curves are different , there will be some dependence of the measured velocity on the source size .",
    "if the sources are known to emit many pions , as is the case in ultra ",
    "relativistic nuclear collisions , this dependence is weak .",
    "however , any velocity measurement using the proposed technique depends somewhat on knowledge of the source size .",
    "we have demonstrated a new procedure for measuring the ratio of a source transverse velocity to the velocity of emitted particles , using the split ",
    "bin correlation functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we showed the technique for two simple cases : two  body decay , and unconstrained decay . in both cases ,",
    "the technique gives a measurement that is independent of the number of sources , and the background size .",
    "in addition , we find that the measurement is independent of the source size for large sources . we have considered somewhat simple cases for pedagogical purposes , in order to illustrate our technique in a simple , model  independent framework .",
    "the specific issue of contamination by dynamical effects should be addressed separately .",
    "similar techniques could be used to measure many other quantities , so the potential usefulness of this line of enquiry is enormous .",
    "for example , comparison of energy and particle  number correlation functions could provide a relatively simple way to measure the energy distribution of minijets in ultra  relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "these techniques are probably of the most use in high multiplicity collisions , where individual sources often can not be resolved .",
    "we hope that our results will encourage other researchers to investigate new uses for correlation functions .",
