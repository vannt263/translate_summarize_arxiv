    "despite overwhelming evidence of the existence of dark matter , its identity has remained unknown for almost eighty years since its first postulation .",
    "we are only almost certain that dark matter is not a part of the standard model of the elementary particle physics .",
    "therefore , it is one of the most important tasks of modern particle physics to identify the origin of dark matter ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    among various candidates for dark matter ,",
    "thermal relic dark matter is one of the most attractive candidates  @xcite .",
    "the thermal relic dark matter explains the observed dark matter density by its freeze - out from the thermal bath . for the @xmath0-wave annihilation , for example",
    ", the observed dark matter density is reproduced when the annihilation cross section satisfies @xmath1@xmath2s .",
    "the beauty of thermal relic dark matter is that the resultant density does not depend on the initial condition as long as dark matter was in the thermal equilibrium in the early universe .    as an important consequence of thermal relic dark matter",
    ", there is an upper limit on the mass of dark matter from the so - called unitarity limit on the annihilation cross section  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0-wave annihilation cross section of dark matter with a mass @xmath3 is limited from above by unitarity ; @xmath4 combined with the required cross section mentioned above , the upper limit on the dark matter mass turns out to be about a hundred tev .    in this paper , we challenge the unitarity limit on the mass of thermal relic dark matter .",
    "in fact , the above unitarity limit applies when the dark matter is a point - like particle .",
    "if dark matter is a bound state with a large radius compared with its compton length , on the other hand , it may have a geometrical cross section for annihilation  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . with the larger cross section , thermal relic dark matter with a mass much larger than a few hundred tev is possible .",
    "we construct a simple model where bound state dark matter annihilate while they have large radii and hence have a large geometrical cross section .",
    "this mechanism should be compared with the enhancement of the dark matter annihilation cross section by the so - called sommerfeld enhancement  @xcite . in this case , the dark matter itself is a rather point - like particle , and hence , the enhanced cross section does satisfy the unitarity limit of point - like particles ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent discussion ) . in a model discussed in this paper , on the other hand , dark matter itself is a bound state and has an annihilation cross section of a geometrical size with which the number density of dark matter is significantly reduced .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section[sec : model ] , we introduce a model based on a simple strongly coupled gauge theory . in section[sec : relic ] , we discuss thermal history and the relic density of dark matter .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "there , we also comment on a possible application of the present model to explain the excess of the observed flux of extraterrestrial neutrinos in the pev range  @xcite . in the appendices , we also discuss two alternative models .",
    "let us consider an @xmath5 gauge theory with one - flavor of weyl fermions , ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , in the fundamental and the anti - fundamental representations .",
    "we call ( @xmath8 ) the quarks in the following",
    ". the quark does not carry any gauge charges under the standard model gauge groups . for a while ,",
    "we assume that the quark possesses a mass , @xmath9 .    as a special feature of the present model",
    ", we arrange the dynamical scale of @xmath5 , @xmath10 , to be much smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "that is , we take the gauge coupling constant at the renormalization scale around @xmath9 small ; @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fine - structure constant . below @xmath9 ,",
    "the model behaves as the pure - yang mills theory . according to the standard understanding of qcd ,",
    "this theory also exhibits confinement , which has been confirmed by lattice simulations e.g.  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for earlier disucssion ) .",
    "after confinement , the gluons of @xmath5 gauge theory are bounded into light glueballs , @xmath13 s , with masses of @xmath14 .",
    "the heavy quarks are , on the other hand , trapped into quarkonia ( we call mesons , @xmath15 s ) or in heavy baryons , @xmath16 s .",
    "the masses of those heavy mesons and baryons are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "a striking feature of this setup is that the chromo - electric flux tube of @xmath5  @xcite can be stretched much longer than @xmath19 due to the heaviness of the quarks  @xcite .",
    "it eventually breaks - up and creates a pair of a quark and an anti - quark when its length becomes of @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the string tension made by the flux tube .",
    "therefore , the @xmath5 gauge dynamics leads to a rather long - range force even after confinement .",
    "the quarks are stable and can be a dark matter candidate due to a vector - like global @xmath22 symmetry under which the quarks are charged .",
    "we call this symmetry the @xmath23 symmetry .",
    "the quarks , however , do not become dark matter as they are . as noted above , they are confined into hadrons when the temperature of the universe becomes lower than the critical temperature @xmath24 . below the critical temperature ,",
    "the @xmath23 charges of the quarks are inherited to the baryons , and the lightest baryon , @xmath25 becomes dark matter eventually .",
    ", possesses a spin @xmath26 due to the fermi - statistics . ] the mesons ,",
    "on the other hand , do not carry the @xmath23 charges and are not stable .",
    "in fact , the ground state meson , for example , immediately decays into a pair of the glueballs as we will see shortly .    for a successful model of thermal relic",

    "the  axion \" component @xmath35 , on the other hand , obtains a mass from explicit breaking of the @xmath29 symmetry .",
    "when the explicit breaking effects are dominated by the @xmath29 anomaly of @xmath5 , the axion mass is estimated to be @xmath38 which is much smaller than the dynamical scale .    as a portal to the standard model",

    "the lorentz indices of the field strengths @xmath46 ( qcd ) and @xmath47 ( qed ) should be understood .",

    "since the @xmath29 symmetry is not only broken by the qcd but also by @xmath5 which possesses its own @xmath156-term , it is apparently difficult for the axion in this model to solve the strong @xmath112-problem . however , if the @xmath157 can be regarded as a counterpart of the qcd in a mirror copy of the standard model , exchange symmetry between the standard model and the copied sector , which is broken spontaneously . ]",
    "the @xmath156 terms in @xmath158 and the qcd are aligned , so that the axion in the present model might solve the strong @xmath112-problem@xcite .",
    "such a possibility will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "finally , let us comment on a possible phenomenological application of the present model .",
    "in recent years , the icecube experiment  @xcite has reported the excess in the observed flux of extraterrestrial neutrinos in the pev range .",
    "dark matter with a mass in the pev range is considered to be one of the attractive explanation of the excess  @xcite .",
    "for example , the excess can be accounted for by dark matter with spin @xmath159 and a mass @xmath160pev which decays into neutrinos via @xmath161 for @xmath162gev ( corresponding lifetime of dark matter of @xmath163s ) @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath164 and @xmath165 represent the lepton and higgs doublets in the standard model and @xmath166 is dark matter with spin @xmath159 , respectively ,    a serious drawback in the dark matter interpretation of the pev neutrino flux is that its relic density can not be explained by thermal relic density due to the unitarity limit . as we have discussed , however , thermal relic density can be consistent with the observed dark matter even for pev dark matter .",
    "in fact , @xmath166 can be identified with the baryons @xmath94 . )",
    "is provided by a planck suppressed operator of the quarks , @xmath167 is expected to be much larger than @xmath162gev . to provide appropriate @xmath167 , we need further extension of the model at the energy scale much larger than @xmath9 such as the emergence of conformal dynamics .",
    "] therefore , the icecube results can be interpreted by the decay of pev _ thermal relic dark matter _ in the present model .",

    "in the main text , we assumed that the dark matter sector is connected to the standard model dominantly through the axion . in this appendix",
    ", we consider an alternative model to connect the dark matter sector to the standard model sector via the higgs portal .- quarks annihilates not into @xmath27 s but into gluons and/or higgs at the perturbative freeze - out , which does not affect the thermal history after the confinement . ]    for that purpose , we introduce two additional flavors of the fermions in addition to the @xmath6-quarks , and assume that they form the doublet representation of the @xmath168 and have hypercharges of @xmath169 . of the standard model gauge groups .",
    "we call the doublet quark @xmath170 and couple them to the standard model higgs doublet @xmath165 via , @xmath171 here , @xmath172 is taken to be somewhat larger than @xmath9 so that they do not affect the properties of the mesons and baryons discussed in the main text .",
    "we do not need to have a complex scalar field @xmath27 in this model .",
    "@xmath173 s decay into a pair of the higgs doublet and a quark @xmath6 .    by integrating out @xmath173",
    ", we obtain an effective coupling between the higgs doublets and the @xmath5 gauge bosons , @xmath174 the lorentz indices of the field strengths @xmath175 of @xmath5 should be understood .",
    "the advantage of the model with the higgs portal is the efficient decay of the lightest glueballs .",
    "in fact , the above operator leads to an effective operator @xmath176 which leads to a decay width , @xmath177 here , we again use the naive dimensional analysis@xcite . therefore",
    ", the decay width and the corresponding decay temperature of @xmath113 can be as large as the ones in eqs.([eq : gs0 ] ) and ( [ eq : tdglue ] ) for @xmath178 .",
    "thus , in the model with higgs portal , the glueball decays efficiently without requiring @xmath121 .",
    "as another alternative model , we may consider an @xmath179 model with two flavors @xmath180 and @xmath181 where @xmath6 and @xmath182 ( @xmath183 and @xmath184 ) possess @xmath185 charges @xmath186 and @xmath187 ( @xmath188 and @xmath67 ) , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 and @xmath182 have almost the same masses , @xmath189 so that the model possesses an approximate global @xmath190 symmetry .    in this case ,",
    "the light baryon states consist of an @xmath190 doublet baryons , @xmath191 with a spin @xmath192 and an @xmath190 quadruplet baryons , @xmath193 with a spin @xmath159 . due to the spin - spin interaction",
    ", we expect that @xmath194 is heavier than @xmath195 by      furthermore , the neutral baryon @xmath197 is lighter due to the @xmath185 interaction , by , @xmath198 therefore , in this case , the lightest baryon is expected to be @xmath199 in @xmath195 , which is neutral under @xmath185 and can be identified with dark matter .",
    "gauge interactions , the mass of the @xmath182 quark is expected to be smaller than that of the @xmath6 quark . here , we assume that the masses of @xmath6 s and @xmath182 s are finely tuned so that the mass differences between the baryons are mainly given by eqs.([eq : dm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dm2 ] ) . ]    to make unwanted charged particles in the dark matter sector decay , we introduce a light complex scalar field @xmath0 which has a hypercharge @xmath200 and the following coupling , @xmath201 though this interaction , the mesons decay into @xmath0 s ( and glueballs ) and the heavier baryons decay into the lightest baryon by emitting @xmath0 s .",
    "finally , @xmath0 decays into the standard model sector via , for example , @xmath202 where @xmath167 denotes a dimensionful parameter .",
    "is charged under @xmath185 , it should be heavy enough so that the constraints from the collider experiments are avoided . ]",
    "one might be interested in a model where @xmath203 and @xmath204 form the doublets of the @xmath168 gauge symmetry of the standard model with the hypercharges @xmath205 and @xmath206 , respectively . in this case , the dark matter is again expected to be @xmath199 in @xmath195 , although the mass difference between @xmath199 and @xmath207 is much smaller , @xmath208mev@xcite . due to the couplings to the weak gauge bosons ,",
    "the mesons and the heavier baryons immediately decay without introducing @xmath0",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the direct detection experiments , the xenon100 @xcite and the lux @xcite , have put severe lower limit on the dark matter mass , @xmath209 therefore , more suppression on the dark matter density is required for a consistent model ( see fig.[fig : summary ] ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath80 is achieved , we expect further suppression of the dark matter density since the strings dominantly break - up and create a pair of the quarks and anti - quarks , and hence , most of the quarks are expected to be trapped into mesons at @xmath77 .",
    "such a possibility will be discussed elsewhere ."
