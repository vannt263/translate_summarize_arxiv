    "the origin of large - scale magnetic fields observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters still remains unclear .",
    "the most widely accepted theory is the astrophysical scenario in which seed magnetic fields are generated by the battery mechanism in astrophysical phenomena and amplified by the dynamo mechanism in the interstellar or intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "however , there is uncertainty about the efficiency of the dynamo mechanism @xcite .",
    "the recent studies on faraday rotation measurements of high redshift quasars suggest the existence of the @xmath0gauss magnetic fields in high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "the existence of such magnetic fields may also challenge the dynamo scenario .",
    "another candidate for the origin of the galactic magnetic fields is primordial magnetic fields which is generated in the early universe @xcite . if primordial magnetic fields existed , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy suffer the effect of primordial magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , the constraint on the primordial magnetic fields through bbn and cmb anisotropy has been studied by many authors .",
    "after the recombination epoch , primordial magnetic fields generate additional density fluctuations by the lorentz force @xcite and many authors have studied their effects on the evolution of the large scale structures ; the redshift - space matter power spectrum , the epoch of reionization , and 21 cm fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it was found that magnetic fields as small as a few nano gauss can give strong cosmological impacts .",
    "therefore detailed observations planned in near future have the potential to set further constraints on primordial magnetic fields .    in this paper , we study the effect of primordial magnetic fields on the mass function of galaxy clusters .",
    "the additional density fluctuations generated by the primordial magnetic fields enhance the formation of galaxy clusters .",
    "thus , number count of clusters can constrain their amplitude as well as the standard cosmological parameters such as the amplitude of density fluctuations ( @xmath1 ) and energy density of matter ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "specifically we investigate the potential of the cluster number count by x - ray observations and sunyaev - zeldivich ( s - z ) survey .",
    "we can find massive clusters by the observation of the x - ray emitted from the hot intracluster gas .",
    "x - ray - flux - selected cluster samples with the calibration between the x - ray temperature and the cluster mass give the mass function of galaxy clusters .",
    "@xcite and @xcite applied it to give a constraint on the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "the s - z effect is the scattering of cmb photons by the hot intracluster electron gas @xcite and is also a powerful tool for detecting galaxy clusters at high redshifts . combining the s - z galaxy survey with x - ray or optical observations , we can obtain the mass- or redshift - abundance of the number of galaxy clusters .",
