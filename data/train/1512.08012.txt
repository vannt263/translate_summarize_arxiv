    "the problem of gravitational radiation in _",
    "massless-_particle collisions is worth studying in its own right and has attracted the interest of many authors in the past as well as very recently .",
    "apart from its obvious relevance in the context of tev - scale gravity models with large extra dimensions @xcite , it is very important in relation to the structure of string theory and the issue of black - hole formation in ultra - planckian collisions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , complete understanding of all facets of the problem is still lacking .",
    "the emission of radiation in the form of _ soft _ gravitons was computed in@xcite in the context of quantum field theory , but in that computation the contribution of the non - linear graviton self - couplings i.e. the stress part of the energy - momentum tensor , was argued to be negligible .",
    "the result of the quantum computation for low - frequency graviton emission was reproduced by a purely classical computation in@xcite .",
    "more recently , a new approach was put forward for the computation of the characteristics of the emitted radiation @xcite , based on the fraunhofer approximation of radiation theory .",
    "the purpose here is to extend the method used in@xcite to the study of gravitational radiation in collisions of massless particles with center - of - mass energy @xmath3 and impact parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the formal limit @xmath5 ( or equivalently @xmath6 for the lorentz factor ) of the massive case leads to nonsensical answers for the radiation efficiency , i.e. the ratio @xmath7 of the radiated to the available energy , the characteristic radiation frequency @xmath8 , or the characteristic emission angle @xmath9 .",
    "we study classically the gravitational radiation in the collision of massless particles using the same perturbative approach as in @xcite .",
    "this presentation is mainly based on results obtained in@xcite .",
    "the action describing the two massless particles and their gravitational interaction reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the einbein of the trajectory @xmath12 in terms of the corresponding affine parameter @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the summation is over the two particles .",
    "we will be using unprimed and primed symbols to denote quantities related to the two particles .",
    "for identical colliding particles in the center - of - mass frame @xmath15 with @xmath16 the energy of each colliding particle .",
    "thus , the particles move on null geodesics , while variation of @xmath17 leads to the particle equation of motion : @xmath18 and similarly for @xmath19 .",
    "the particle energy - momentum is defined by @xmath20 . at zeroth order in the gravitational interaction , the space - time is flat and the particles move on straight lines with constant velocities , i.e. @xmath21 given that @xmath22 is traceless , the perturbation @xmath23 satisfies for each particle separately the equation @xmath24 whose solution in coordinate representation is the aichelburg ",
    "sexl metric @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath27dimensional fourier transform of @xmath28 : @xmath29 with @xmath30 an arbitrary constant length parameter .",
    "write for the metric @xmath31 and substitute in ( [ peom ] ) to obtain for the first correction of the trajectory of the unprimed particle the equation @xmath32 the interaction with the self - field of the particle has been omitted and @xmath33 due to the primed particle is evaluated at the location of the unprimed particle on its unperturbed trajectory .",
    "integrating ( [ peom1 ] ) one obtains the trajectory in components : @xmath34 which vanish for all .",
    "indeed , the massless particle trajectories should remain undisturbed before the collision .",
    "thus , we reproduce the leading order expressions of the two well - known facts @xcite about the geodesics in an aichelburg - sexl metric , namely : ( i ) the _ time delay _ at the moment of shock equal to @xmath35 ( ii ) the _ refraction _ caused by the gravitational interaction by an angle @xmath36 in the direction of the center of gravity .",
    "the gravitational wave source has two parts .",
    "one is the particle energy - momentum contribution , localized on the accelerated particle trajectories .    the direct particle contribution to the source of radiation",
    "is called  local \" , because it is localized on the particle trajectories .",
    "the first order term in the expansion of @xmath37 is @xmath38 \\delta^4 \\!\\!{\\kern 1pt}\\left(x-\\ ! \\ ! { \\ , ^0\\!}z(\\sigma ) \\right)\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is evaluated at @xmath40 and @xmath41 is evaluated at @xmath42 .    in fourier",

    ".,width=415 ]    * zero - frequency limit .",
    "* in the low - frequency regime ( @xmath55 ) the amplitude @xmath56 dominates and has the form @xmath57 while @xmath58 is finite ( as @xmath59 ) and gives subleading contribution to .",
    "the angular integration leads to @xmath60 , which diverges and implies that our formulae are not valid for @xmath61 close to zero .",
    "we can not trust our formulae in regime i and should repair them .",
    "a quick way to do it , is to impose a small - angle cut - off @xmath62 on the @xmath63integration , so as to obtain for @xmath64 the value computed quantum mechanically in@xcite : @xmath65 which agrees with our expression for @xmath66 thus , in regime ii we use our formula , which is identical to weinberg s .",
    "now for any frequency we have to compare our matter part , which makes the @xmath63integration divergent , with the weinberg s : @xmath67    to leading order in our approximation the scattering process , we are dealing with , is elastic with @xmath68 .",
    "write for the incoming particles @xmath69 and for the outgoing ones @xmath70 , substitute into @xmath71 , and expand in powers of @xmath2 to have @xmath72 , to obtain the tensor which is _ identical _ to the local part @xmath37 we use , at _ any _ frequency .",
    "therefore , it is natural to impose the angular cutoff @xmath73 for all frequencies of the emitted graviton .",
    "* regime vi . * for @xmath74",
    "the two radiation amplitudes read : @xmath75 from which one can obtain an estimate for the frequency distribution of the emitted radiation in regime vi by integrating over @xmath76 and over @xmath77 , namely @xmath78 as well as an estimate for the emitted energy and the corresponding efficiency in regime vi , by integrating also over @xmath79 , @xmath80    * regime iv . * inside the regime",
    "iva the amplitude is damped as in regime vi .",
    "however , near the left border of regime ivb ( with @xmath81 ) one may expand the amplitudes in powers of @xmath82 and obtain ( [ scalampl2dd ] ) . upon integration over regime ivb ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath83 , one obtains @xmath84 thus , for @xmath81 one may approximate @xmath85 by @xmath86 it should be pointed out here that the integral of @xmath87 over @xmath88 receives most of its contribution from frequencies in the neighborhood of @xmath89 in both regimes iv and vi .",
    "thus , one can say that the characteristic frequency of the emitted radiation is around @xmath90 .",
    "* total emitted radiation . * upon integration ( [ scalampl2dd ] ) leads to the angular distribution @xmath91 integration over @xmath92 gives @xmath93",
    "using the same approach as in @xcite , based on standard gr , with the leading non - linear gravity effects taken into account , we studied collisions of massless particles and computed the gravitational energy of arbitrary frequency , which is emitted outside the cone of angle @xmath94 in the forward and backward directions .",
    "the value @xmath95 was obtained for the radiation efficiency , with characteristic frequency @xmath96 .",
    "in fact , this value represents a lower bound of the efficiency , since it does not include the energy emitted inside that cone .",
    "the frequency distribution of radiation in the characteristic angle - frequency regimes is shown in fig.[table ] .",
    "unfortunately , we can not yet confirm the presence of any other characteristic frequency@xcite , such as e.g. @xmath97 , or characteristic emission angle smaller than @xmath2 .",
