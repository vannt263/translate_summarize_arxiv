    "we study here the dynamics of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universes in @xmath1 theories of gravity .",
    "these theories are derived from generalisations of the usual einstein - hilbert lagrangian of general relativity ( gr ) , such that @xmath2 and have been considered extensively in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "specification of the function @xmath1 defines the theory , and gr can be seen to be the special case @xmath3 .",
    "such theories have drawn considerable interest as they found success in early attempts to create a perturbatively re - normalisable quantum field theory of gravity @xcite , as well as turning up more recently in the effective actions of string theory @xcite .",
    "in cosmology these theories have been used extensively in attempts to explain the late - time accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite , cosmological inflation @xcite and the nature of the initial singularity @xcite . for",
    "a recent review see @xcite .    in considering generalised @xmath1 theories of gravity",
    "it is often implicitly assumed that at late times in the evolution of the universe it should be the lowest powers of @xmath0 that dominate the gravitational lagrangian .",
    "that is , at late times we should have @xmath4 , and the universe should behave as if it were governed by a gravitational lagrangian of the form @xmath5 which is often presumed to correspond to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , although other limits have been considered in attempts to address the apparent late - time acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "conversely , the introduction of higher powers of @xmath0 into the gravitational lagrangian has often been assumed to mean that at early times the universe should behave as if governed by the vacuum dynamics of a lagrangian @xmath6 the picture is then one of a universe that starts off at high @xmath0 , dominated by a lagrangian of the form ( [ high ] ) , and that subsequently expands until @xmath0 becomes small and the gravitational dynamics are dominated by a lagrangian of the form ( [ low ] ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to determine the veracity of such assumptions .",
    "this is achieved by studying the dynamical evolution of frw universes , governed by theories with general @xmath1 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the general solution to the friedmann equations is then investigated , and used to evaluate the extent to which the afore mentioned behaviour may be considered generic .",
    "the general solutions of frw cosmologies governed by @xmath1 theories of gravity have been studied previously by a number of authors , in a number of different contexts .",
    "much of this work has made use of the dynamical systems approach , which has been used to study specific classes of @xmath1 in isotropic cosmologies in @xcite , and anisotropic cosmologies in @xcite .",
    "exact analytic expressions have been found for the general frw solutions of some @xmath1 theories in @xcite , and the dynamical systems approach applied to general @xmath1 has been considered in @xcite . for studies of spherically symmetric and weak field solutions",
    "see @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the approach used here is a generalisation of the analysis performed in @xcite , where theories of the form @xmath7 were considered .",
    "we find here that the late - time attractors of frw cosmologies for general @xmath1 have various different forms , and that the asymptote toward which the general solution is attracted depends upon the initial conditions .",
    "some of these solutions correspond to the lowest powers of @xmath1 dominating at late - times , and others to the highest powers . expanding universes with powers of @xmath0 lower than @xmath8 dominating their dynamics",
    "generically appear to exhibit the former behaviour , while universes with powers of @xmath0 greater than @xmath8 dominating appear to generically exhibit the latter . expanding universes with higher powers of @xmath0 dominating their early evolution therefore appear unlikely to evolve to a state where the einstein - hilbert term dominates .",
    "we also find that there usually exist multiple early - time attractors for the general solution .",
    "these can take on different forms , but generically it appears that they either evolve as @xmath9 , toward a big bang singularity in the past , or that they approach a point of inflexion , where the scale factor is constant .",
    "this is in good agreement with the analytic general solutions for @xmath10 found in @xcite .",
    "these results do not mean that a period of inflation can not occur ( as indeed it appears to if @xmath11 ) , but it does mean that the general solution does not generally start off inflating ( even if @xmath11 ) .",
    "it also means that the picture of the highest powers of @xmath0 dominating the earliest stages of the universe s evolution may not be an accurate one .",
    "we begin in section 2 by giving the frw field equations for @xmath1 theories , together with some simple power - law particular solutions that will later appear as asymptotes of the general solution . in section 3",
    "we use a dynamical systems approach to determine the form of the general solution for vacuum cosmologies .",
    "the phase space of the general solution is two dimensional , and the location and stability of critical points in this space is determined . in section 4",
    "we perform a similar analysis for the case of perfect fluid cosmologies .",
    "the phase space of the general solution is now three dimensional , and the location and stability of critical points is again determined . in section 5",
    "we consider the effect of adding higher and lower powers of @xmath0 to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "section 6 provides a discussion of the results , and the appendix gives some special cases that are of particular interest .",
    "replacing the ricci scalar , @xmath0 , in the einstein - hilbert action by a more general function , @xmath1 , gives the lagrangian density @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the lagrangian density of matter fields .",
    "variation of the corresponding action , with respect to the metric , gives the field equations @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter fields , defined in the usual way .",
    "the lagrangian formulation of the theory guarantees the conservation equations @xmath17 .",
    "substituting the frw metric into the field equations , ( [ field ] ) , gives the analogue of the friedmann equations @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scale factor , and here we have assumed the matter fields are well described by a perfect fluid , with barotropic equation of state @xmath20 .",
    "the conservation equations are then , as usual , @xmath21 and the ricci scalar is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the constant curvature of homogeneous spatial 3-surfaces . henceforth ,",
    "unless explicitly stated otherwise , we will be considering only the spatially flat class of models , where @xmath24 .",
    "spatially curved models will be investigated elsewhere .",
    "the field equations ( [ friedmann1])-([ricci ] ) have a number of particular solutions that are of interest .",
    "these solutions often act as attractors , toward which the general solutions can asymptote .",
    "such behaviour will be shown in subsequent sections .",
    "first let us consider the ` vacuum dominated ' solution    [ vacuum ] a ~(t - t_0)^ & &    where @xmath25 is a constant , and @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 that @xmath28constant is a requirement on the theory in order for the solution to exist .",
    "equation ( [ vacuum ] ) represents a cosmology in which the evolution of the scale factor is dominated by the dynamics of the ricci curvature itself .",
    "it is this type of evolution that is often invoked to account for the late - time acceleration of the universe , or its inflation at early times . in the limit that gr is approached , and @xmath29",
    ", this solution reduces to minkowski space .",
    "another solution of interest is the ` matter dominated ' solution    [ matter ] a ~(t - t_0)^. & &    again , this solution exists if @xmath28constant ( not necessarily the same constant as in ( [ vacuum ] ) ) .",
    "this solution , if it exists , is dependent on the matter content of the space - time , as can be seen from the explicit dependence on @xmath30 . as @xmath29 , and gr is approached , this solution reduces to the usual spatially flat , perfect fluid dominated friedmann solution .",
    "the last particular solution of interest is the tolman solution    [ radiation ] a ~(t - t_0)^. & &    this solution is independent of both the matter content of the universe , and of the form of @xmath1 .",
    "we call it the tolman solution as it is identical to the radiation dominated friedmann solution of gr .",
    "however , this solution does not necessarily require the presence of either radiation ( @xmath31 ) , or of an einstein - hilbert term in the action .",
    "we will now proceed to investigate the form of the general solutions to equations ( [ friedmann1])-([ricci ] ) , first for the vacuum case ( @xmath32 ) , and then for the perfect fluid case ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the particular solutions above will often appear as the asymptotic form of the general solution , as @xmath34 or @xmath35constant .",
    "in the case of vacuum cosmologies we have @xmath32 . the field equations ( [ friedmann1])-([ricci ] ) can now be transformed into a system of first - order differential equations , by defining the time coordinate @xmath36 , and the new variables @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the equations ( [ friedmann1])-([ricci ] ) then become @xmath40 with the constraint @xmath41 where primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath42 , and @xmath43sign@xmath44 .",
    "these definitions ensure @xmath42 is always real , and monotonically increasing in @xmath45 .",
    "the two new functionals @xmath46 and @xmath47 are defined by @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "specifying @xmath1 gives @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the system of equations ( [ vac1])-([vaccon ] ) is closed .",
    "however , even before specifying @xmath1 it is possible to determine some generic features of the system above , and hence of vacuum @xmath1 frw cosmologies in general .",
    "the form of equations ( [ vac1])-([vaccon ] ) allow us to treat the problem as a dynamical system , in which the general solutions for @xmath1 vacuum frw cosmologies are given as trajectories in the phase space ( @xmath52,@xmath53,@xmath54 )",
    ". such an analysis will allow insight into the behaviour of these models .",
    "first we note that the surface @xmath55 is an invariant sub - manifold of the ( @xmath52,@xmath53,@xmath54 ) phase space . from ( [ vaccon ] )",
    "it can be seen that @xmath55 corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "equations ( [ vac1])-([vaccon ] ) then give @xmath57 so there are no trajectories in ( @xmath52 , @xmath53,@xmath54 ) that allow @xmath0 to change sign along them .",
    "this justifies our choice of @xmath54 .",
    "it is now convenient to perform a transformation from the infinite plane spanned by ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , to a finite closed space .",
    "this can be achieved by the re - definitions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which give @xmath60 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\cos ( 2 \\theta ) + \\sin ( 2\\theta ) } { 12 bq}}\\\\ z^{\\prime } & = 2 a p \\sqrt{\\frac{b q}{6 \\cot \\theta ( 1+\\cot \\theta ) } } , \\label{r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constraint ( [ vaccon ] ) has been used , @xmath61 is the sign of @xmath53 , and @xmath62 runs from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "it can now be seen that , independent of the value of @xmath65 , there exist stationary points in ( @xmath52,@xmath53 ) at @xmath66 in the limit @xmath67constant or @xmath68 , if this exists , there are two further stationary points in the ( @xmath52,@xmath53 ) plane at @xmath69 the value of @xmath26 , and the existence of these last two points , depends on the form of @xmath1 , and can be straight - forwardly deduced once this function is specified .",
    "various cases will be considered in later sections .",
    "first we will investigate the behaviour of the scale factor at the points @xmath70 , identified above .    from the definitions of @xmath52 and @xmath53 we have , at stationary @xmath71 , that @xmath72 which can be integrated to obtain @xmath73 .",
    "eliminating @xmath74 in equations ( [ friedmann1 ] ) and ( [ friedmann2 ] ) , and substituting for @xmath75 , then gives @xmath76 which , for @xmath77 or @xmath78 , integrates to @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath25 are constants . substituting @xmath71 from points @xmath70 then gives the form of the scale factor as these points are approached .",
    "for the special cases @xmath81 or @xmath78 we instead have @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a constant . for points",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 this corresponds to @xmath86 or @xmath78 .",
    "the stationary points @xmath78 and @xmath87 can now be seen to correspond to @xmath88 , and points @xmath89 and @xmath90 to the tolman solution , ( [ radiation ] ) . for @xmath91 or @xmath78",
    "we find points @xmath84 and @xmath85 correspond to the vacuum dominated solution , ( [ vacuum ] ) .",
    "these results are summarised in table [ table1 ] , where symbols refer to those used in figure [ vacplot ] .",
    ".the evolution of the scale factor , @xmath92 , at the critical points @xmath78-@xmath85 in vacuum @xmath1 cosmologies .",
    "the listed symbols correspond to those used in figure [ vacplot ] . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the general solutions to the friedmann equations ( [ friedmann1])-([friedmann2 ] ) in the presence of a perfect fluid are more complicated than the vacuum case .",
    "the phase space of solutions is now , in general , three dimensional .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible to make progress in understanding the general solution .",
    "as was previously noted , the surfaces @xmath93 ( corresponding to @xmath55 ) are invariant sub - manifolds of the phase space .",
    "this equation has two roots , describing two non - intersecting surfaces that separate the the phase space into three different regions , between which trajectories can not cross .",
    "the shape of these regions depends on the sign of @xmath94 , and is illustrated in figures [ fluidplot1]-[fluidplot6 ] by the grey and white areas .",
    "these plots show the ( @xmath52,@xmath53 ) plane , and some representative trajectories within it , for various values of @xmath30 and @xmath65 . the left - hand plot , ( a ) , in each of these figures corresponds to @xmath95 , and the right - hand plot , ( b ) , to @xmath96 .",
    "a number of parallels can be drawn between the perfect fluid cosmologies , illustrated in figures [ fluidplot1]-[fluidplot6 ] , and the vacuum cosmologies , illustrated in figure [ vacplot ] .",
    "the circle at @xmath97 in figures [ fluidplot1]-[fluidplot6 ] can be seen to be quite similar to the circle in figure [ vacplot ] .",
    "they both have stationary points at @xmath98 and @xmath99 , corresponding to @xmath100constant , and at @xmath101 and @xmath102 , corresponding to @xmath103 ( although the coordinates have different definitions in each case ) .",
    "whatsmore , in both cases these points mark the boundaries of regions between which trajectories can not pass .",
    "a further similarity is in the position of the triangles , which correspond to the vacuum dominated solution , ( [ vacuum ] ) . in both cases , for @xmath104 or @xmath105 , these points exist in what are labelled as region @xmath106 and @xmath107 in figure [ vacplot ] , and for @xmath108 , they exist in regions @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "all of the points at @xmath97 therefore have analogous points in the vacuum cosmology case , and all of these points can be seen to exist for any @xmath30 , @xmath65 and @xmath94 ( as long as @xmath67constant in the case of points @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) .",
    "as @xmath111 increases these perfect fluid cosmologies therefore approach the behaviour of the vacuum cosmologies studied above .",
    "the principle difference between the perfect fluid case and the vacuum case is due to the existence of the extra dimension in the phase space .",
    "points that were previously attractors ( or repellors ) in vacuo , can now be saddles in the presence of a perfect fluid , as they can be unstable ( or stable ) in the extra dimension .",
    "whether these points maintain the attractor / repellor nature they exhibited in vacuo , or become saddles , can be read off from tables [ table4]-[table7 ] .    as well as the points at @xmath97 , there can exist four further points at finite distances in the ( @xmath52,@xmath53 ) plane .",
    "these are points @xmath112-@xmath113 , given by equations ( [ xy12 ] ) and ( [ xy34 ] ) .",
    "they have no analogy in the vacuum cosmologies considered above , and do not exist for all @xmath30 , @xmath65 and @xmath94 .",
    "points @xmath112 and @xmath114 correspond to the tolman solution , ( [ radiation ] ) , and exist on the boundaries between grey and white regions .",
    "points @xmath115 and @xmath113 , correspond to the matter dominated solution ( [ matter ] ) , and can exist in either the grey or white regions .",
    "for @xmath95 they are saddles if they exist in the the white region , and attractor / repellors if they exist in the grey regions . for @xmath96 this behaviour",
    "is reversed .",
    "if both of these sets of points exist then one of them will be a pair of saddle points , while the other will be an attractor / repellor pair .",
    "in general , the existence and stability of these points are functions of @xmath30 , @xmath65 and @xmath94 , the details of which can be read off from tables [ table4]-[table7 ] .",
    "the existence , location and stability of the critical points , in the presence of a perfect fluid , is more complicated than the vacuum case . rather than discuss all possible trajectories",
    ", we will therefore show a number of examples that we consider to be illustrative . in these examples",
    "@xmath65 will taken as a constant .",
    "it should be emphasised that in general @xmath65 is _ not _ a constant . however , for the purposes of illustrating the existence and attractor / repellor nature of the stationary points , for various different values of @xmath65 , it is convenient to take it as so .",
    "figure [ fluidplot1 ] shows the ( @xmath52,@xmath53 ) plane for a universe filled with pressureless dust , @xmath116 , for the case @xmath117 .",
    "such a value of @xmath65 may be expected if @xmath118 , and so may be of interest when higher powers of the curvature are expected to dominate the gravitational lagrangian . here",
    "the points at @xmath97 have locations and stability analogous to the vacuum case .",
    "there are also two points at finite distance , corresponding to the matter dominated solution , ( [ matter ] ) , when @xmath95 , and the tolman solution , ( [ radiation ] ) , when @xmath96 .",
    "these points , however , are both saddles , and asymptotic behaviour in this case is therefore very similar to the corresponding vacuum cosmology .",
    "consider now the effect of lower orders of @xmath0 dominating the gravitational lagrangian .",
    "if @xmath119 dominates then we may expect @xmath120 .",
    "this case , with a dust equation of state , is illustrated in figure [ fluidplot2 ] .",
    "the asymptotes of the trajectories in figure [ fluidplot2 ] can be seen to be very similar to those in figure [ fluidplot1 ] , and again the stability and location of the critical points are analogous to the corresponding vacuum cosmology .",
    "only saddle points are introduced at finite distances in ( @xmath52,@xmath53 ) .",
    "let us now consider some ranges of @xmath65 for which we know the stability properties of the critical points to change .",
    "first consider @xmath65 in the range @xmath121 , say @xmath122 .",
    "this case would be expected from @xmath123 , and is shown in figure [ fluidplot3 ] , for @xmath124 . for @xmath95 the points 3 and 4 , at @xmath101 and @xmath125 , are now no longer attractor / repellors , but saddle points .",
    "trajectories that would otherwise have ended on them are now therefore drawn to points 1 and 2 , at @xmath99 and @xmath98 .",
    "there are no new points at finite distances in this case , and the behaviour is otherwise the same as the corresponding vacuum cosmology . for @xmath96 points 3 and 4",
    "are again saddles .",
    "now , however , all four possible points at finite distances exist .",
    "the points 9 and 10 are now attractor / repellors , and so this case is qualitatively different from the corresponding vacuum cosmology , with new asymptotes possible .",
    "the case with @xmath96 is that which was considered in @xcite .",
    "another range of @xmath65 which we may wish to consider is @xmath126 , which is shown in figure [ fluidplot5 ] for @xmath127 , corresponding to @xmath128 .",
    "the stability of the triangular points , corresponding to the vacuum solution ( [ vacuum ] ) , is now reversed , as would be expected from analogy with the vacuum cosmology . now",
    "the circular points at @xmath99 and @xmath98 are saddles , and the squares again have the attractor / repellor behaviour that would be expected from the corresponding vacuum cosmologies .",
    "the case @xmath95 contains no extra critical points at finite distances , and so again has asymptotics that are otherwise the same as the vacuum case .",
    "for @xmath96 all four points at finite distances are present , and again points 9 and 10 act as attractor / repellors .",
    "these examples have been intended to show some representative illustrations of the ( @xmath52,@xmath53 ) phase plane , for different values of @xmath65 .",
    "the figures shown above do not show all possible behaviours , and should not be considered exhaustive .",
    "it is , for example , quite possible to have points 7 and 8 acting as attractor / repellors , although this was not explicitly the case in any of the examples above .",
    "the reader will be able to find ranges of @xmath65 and @xmath30 where this behaviour occurs , for either @xmath94 , by referencing tables [ table4]-[table7 ] , above .",
    "it is of interest to note that for all but one configurations of @xmath65 , @xmath30 and @xmath94 , there exists in each region of the ( @xmath52,@xmath53 ) plane at least one attractor and one repellor .",
    "this is a necessary condition for there to exist no closed orbits , and for there to be at least one available attractor for each trajectory to end one , and one repellor from which it can begin .",
    "the exceptional case is @xmath96 , @xmath126 and @xmath129 . in this case there",
    "exist regions which are either without an attractor , or without a repellor .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fluidplot6 ] .",
    "the star in the right - hand white region can be seen to act as an attractor , but following trajectories in this region backwards shows that they continue to spiral outwards forever .",
    "such a trajectories therefore has no simple asymptote in the past .",
    "similarly , in the left - hand white region of this plot all trajectories begin on the star , and spiral outwards forever as they are followed forward in time .",
    "let us now consider further the behaviour of the scale factor , @xmath92 , as the critical points are approached .",
    "trajectories approaching the points @xmath78-@xmath85 all have evolutions similar to those approaching the analogous points in the vacuum case .",
    "if condition ( [ range ] ) is met , then expanding trajectories with these points in their past all start with a big - bang singularity . expanding trajectories that asymptote toward these points exhibit power - law behaviour , as @xmath130 .",
    "if condition ( [ range ] ) is not met , then expanding trajectories approaching points @xmath84 and @xmath85 have a big - rip singularity in their future .",
    "the matter dominated points , @xmath115 and @xmath113 , have no analogy in the vacuum cosmologies .",
    "trajectories ending on these points approach the matter dominated solution ( [ matter ] ) .",
    "when @xmath131 these points correspond to a big bang in the past of expanding solutions , and to power - law expansion in their future .",
    "if @xmath132 , for expanding solutions , then there is a big rip in the future , where @xmath133 at finite @xmath45 .",
    "the two remaining points , @xmath78 and @xmath87 , are at @xmath134 , and @xmath135 . in general",
    "it is required to solve the dynamical equation ( [ dyn3])-([constraint ] ) , for some particular @xmath1 , in order to find the form of @xmath92 as these points are approached .",
    "if @xmath136 and @xmath137constant in this limit then ( [ dyn3])-([constraint ] ) give @xmath138 where @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 are constants .",
    "the definition of @xmath142 , ( [ t ] ) , can then be integrated to @xmath143 where @xmath25 is another constant .",
    "the limit @xmath144 can now be seen to be reached as @xmath145 , and hence @xmath146 .",
    "the scale factor can then be found , by integrating @xmath52 , to be @xmath147 for @xmath148 or @xmath149 the scale factor therefore reaches a finite value , @xmath80 , as @xmath150 .",
    "the trajectory must then be matched onto another solution at this point , in order to make a complete history .",
    "if @xmath126 then @xmath151 as these points are approached , and there is a big rip as @xmath150 .",
    "most of the asymptotic behaviours found above correspond to scale factors obeying power laws of the form @xmath152 , where @xmath23 is some constant . in such cases",
    "the ricci scalar is given by @xmath153 solutions approaching these asymptotes , as @xmath34 or @xmath25 , therefore have @xmath4 or @xmath68 .",
    "it is then straightforward to read off the values of @xmath136 and @xmath65 for different @xmath1 .",
    "consider , for example , a theory of the type @xmath154 where the @xmath155 are constants , and the sum is over finite @xmath106 . in this case",
    "the functions @xmath136 and @xmath65 are given by @xmath156 it can then be seen that as @xmath4 , @xmath136 and @xmath65 approach the constant values @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the lowest power in @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , as @xmath159 we have @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the highest power in @xmath1 . in such limits",
    "these theories behave as if @xmath162 , with the lowest power in ( [ powerfr ] ) dominating as @xmath4 , and the highest power dominating as @xmath163 . even in the absence of a highest power in @xmath1 ( that is , for an infinite power series )",
    "@xmath136 and @xmath65 can still approach constant values , a necessary condition to allow the existence of the vacuum dominated solutions , ( [ vacuum ] ) , and matter dominated solutions , ( [ matter ] ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath0 at late times , and hence the possible asymptotic behaviour of @xmath92 , can now be determined from the behaviour of @xmath0 in that limit . if the vacuum dominated evolution ( [ vacuum ] ) is approached , as often is the case , then this behaviour can be read off from condition ( [ range ] ) .",
    "for @xmath164 we have at late times that @xmath150 , which corresponds to @xmath159 and , therefore , the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath92 being dominated by the highest power of @xmath0 in the lagrangian .",
    "this range of @xmath65 corresponds to a power @xmath165 with @xmath166 .",
    "conversely , for @xmath132 or @xmath105 we have that @xmath130 at late times , so that @xmath4 , and there can exist an asymptote in which @xmath92 is dominated by the lowest power of @xmath0 .",
    "these ranges of @xmath65 correspond to @xmath165 with @xmath167 .",
    "if a theory contains a low power of @xmath0 in its lagrangian there can then exist a vacuum dominated asymptote where @xmath4 , and in which the lowest power of @xmath0 dominates .",
    "however , if that same theory contains high powers of @xmath0 in its lagrangian there can also exist an asymptote where @xmath168 , and in which the highest power of @xmath0 dominates .",
    "theories with multiple powers of @xmath0 can therefore have their late - time asymptotics dominated by either the lowest _ or _ highest power of @xmath0 .    to illustrate these points further",
    "will now consider some example theories .",
    "consider adding to the einstein - hilbert action higher powers of @xmath0 , such as @xmath8 and @xmath169 .",
    "such modifications have often been considered as possible uv ` corrections ' to gravity , motivated by attempts to construct a perturbatively re - normalisable quantum field theory of gravity .",
    "it is frequently assumed that these higher - order ` corrections ' to gravity should dominate the earliest stages of the universe s evolution .",
    "let us investigate this possibility in the frame - work that has been constructed above .",
    "figure [ ab1 ] shows the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 when @xmath170 .",
    "the dashed line in this plot is @xmath136 , and the solid line is @xmath65 .",
    "one can see the linear term dominates at low @xmath0 , the quadratic term at intermediate @xmath0 , and the cubic term at high @xmath0 .",
    "consider a trajectory in the ` high - curvature ' regime , @xmath171 , so that @xmath172 . in this case the stability of the various critical points , and their locations , are shown in figure [ fluidplot1 ] .",
    "the only expanding attractor is the vacuum dominated solution , ( [ vacuum ] ) , which in this case corresponds to @xmath173 . as this attractor is approached we have @xmath174 , so trajectories are pushed further into the the high @xmath0 regime , and toward an eventual big rip . for a trajectory at high - curvature to find its way down into the intermediate curvature regime , where @xmath8 dominates , it must therefore be either collapsing , or possibly in the early transient stages before an asymptotic attractor is approached .",
    "now consider a trajectory in the @xmath8 dominated regime , @xmath175 , where @xmath176 .",
    "the ( @xmath52,@xmath53 ) plane looks very similar to figure [ fluidplot1 ] in this case , but with the vacuum dominated points @xmath84 and @xmath85 displaced a little .",
    "again , the only expanding attractor is the vacuum dominated solution , which in this case corresponds to exponential expansion , ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "this point is then semi - stable , in the sense described in appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "here we have @xmath177 , so the vacuum dominated exponential expansion will eventually end with the point becoming a saddle in the phase space .",
    "trajectories can then move to the higher or lower @xmath0 regimes .",
    "the picture of a universe starting off expanding with the highest power in @xmath1 dominating , and moving successively down through lower powers of @xmath0 until @xmath178 is reached does not appear to be a generic situation .",
    "in fact , if a higher power of @xmath0 ( other than @xmath8 ) dominates the gravitational dynamics , then it appears that expanding trajectories are generically forced to higher @xmath0 , rather than lower .",
    "the @xmath8 case is exceptional , and in this case expanding vacuum dominated trajectories do appear able to move to the lower @xmath0 regime , although even in this case it does not seem generic .",
    "consider now a gravitational lagrangian with an einstein - hilbert term , and both higher and lower powers of @xmath0 .",
    "lower powers of @xmath0 have been of interest recently , as they can correspond to cosmologies that accelerate at late times .    in figure [ ab2 ]",
    "we show the form of @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the theory @xmath179 . at high @xmath0 the @xmath169 term dominates , at intermediate @xmath0 the einstein - hilbert term dominates , and at low @xmath0 the inverse power , @xmath180 , dominates . as before , when @xmath169 dominates the only expanding attractor at late times corresponds to increasing @xmath0 .",
    "so again , only contracting solutions , or trajectories in the early transient stages , can make it down to the lower curvature regimes .",
    "a solution in the intermediate curvature regime , @xmath181 , is dominated here by the einstein - hilbert term , with @xmath182 . in this case",
    "the dynamical equations reduce to the usual friedmann ones , and so @xmath0 decreases for expanding solutions , allowing for a transition to the @xmath180 regime , @xmath183 , where @xmath184 .",
    "the stability properties and location of critical points in the @xmath180 regime are shown in figure [ fluidplot2 ] .",
    "in this situation we again have that the only expanding attractor is the vacuum dominated solution , ( [ vacuum ] ) . in this case , however , @xmath185 , so this attractor corresponds to decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "trajectories asymptoting toward this point are then pushed further and further into the @xmath180 dominated regime . if we were to have included",
    "an even lower power of @xmath0 , say @xmath186 , then expanding solutions heading toward the attractor solution would be pushed toward the regime in which this power dominates .",
    "expanding solutions in regimes dominated by the einstein - hilbert term , or lower powers of @xmath0 , generically appear to move to lower and lower @xmath0 as they continue to expand .",
    "the term @xmath8 then acts as a watershed : expanding universes dominated by higher powers of @xmath0 appear to evolve toward higher @xmath0 , while expanding universes dominated by lower powers move to lower @xmath0 . for the case of high @xmath0",
    "this corresponds to divergent expansion toward a big rip , and for low @xmath0 it corresponds to ( possibly accelerating ) eternal expansion .",
    "having considered the case of single higher or lower powers dominating the gravitational lagrangian , let us now consider infinite power series .",
    "there are , of course , very many functional forms that one may choose for @xmath1 to illustrate the case of an infinite power series . here",
    "we consider @xmath187 .",
    "the corresponding functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 are shown in figure [ ab3 ] .",
    "it can be seen that there are three different regimes : low @xmath0 at @xmath188 , where the einstein - hilbert term dominates with @xmath189 , intermediate @xmath0 at @xmath190 , where @xmath169 dominates with @xmath191 , and high @xmath0 at @xmath192 , where the exponential dominates with @xmath193 .",
    "the high @xmath0 regime now corresponds to @xmath194 , which is one of the special cases in appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "the vacuum dominated point @xmath84 is again the only expanding attractor , and now this point corresponds to exponential growth of the scale factor , as in ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "this point is then stable , as @xmath195 , but with @xmath196 . while it can be the case that single higher powers dominate at intermediate regimes ( @xmath169 in the region @xmath197 , here ) , the solutions heading toward the expanding attractor in such regimes are forced to higher @xmath0 .",
    "the highest @xmath0 regime here , however , is at @xmath193 .",
    "the late - time attractor then no longer corresponds to a big rip , but to exponential expansion , with @xmath198constant , instead of @xmath199 .",
    "the behaviour of infinite power series in @xmath0 is therefore qualitatively different to the finite series considered previously .",
    "as before , only collapsing solutions , or possibly those in the early transient stages of their evolution , appear able to make it down to the low curvature regime .",
    "we have considered in this paper the evolution of spatially flat frw universes governed by @xmath1 theories of gravity .",
    "the friedmann equations ( [ friedmann1])-([conservation ] ) were transformed into an autonomous system of first - order differential equations , and a dynamical systems analysis was performed .",
    "the location and stability of all critical points in the phase space were found , for both vacuum and perfect fluid cosmologies , and for general @xmath1 .",
    "it was shown that the simple power - law solutions , given by equations ( [ vacuum])-([radiation ] ) , often act as the early and late - time asymptotes of the general solution .",
    "the general behaviour of @xmath1 frw cosmologies is complicated .",
    "the phase space of solutions is often divided into sub - spaces by invariant manifolds , through which the trajectories describing the general solution can not pass .",
    "the asymptotic past of general solutions can contain points of inflexion , or big - bang singularities that can be approached in different ways .",
    "similarly , future behaviour can be seen to be able to asymptote toward matter dominated expansion , ( [ matter ] ) , vacuum domination , ( [ vacuum ] ) , or various other forms .",
    "whatsmore , the three dimensional phase space of solutions , in the presence of a perfect fluid , allows for the possible existence of strange attractors , and chaotic behaviour .    nevertheless , despite the complicated behaviour exhibited by the general solutions , it is still possible to make statements about the effects of modifying the einstein - hilbert action to more general functions of @xmath0",
    "it can be said that theories that contain lower powers of @xmath0 often have a stable asymptote that corresponds to the expanding vacuum dominated solution , ( [ vacuum ] ) , of that lowest power , and that therefore behave as if governed by a gravitational lagrangian of the form ( [ low ] ) at late times .",
    "however , if a theory contains any higher powers of @xmath0 then there is also often a stable asymptote that corresponds to the expanding vacuum dominated solution , ( [ vacuum ] ) , of that highest power , and that therefore behaves as if governed by a lagrangian of the form ( [ high ] ) at late times . theories containing both higher and lower powers of @xmath0 can then asymptote , at late times , to regimes in which either the lowest _ or _ highest powers or @xmath0 dominate . in either case the consequent evolution is that of a gravitational lagrangian dominated by a single power of @xmath0 .",
    "which solutions asymptote to high @xmath0 domination , and which to low @xmath0 domination , depends on the initial conditions , and the form of @xmath1 . using illustrative examples",
    "we have shown that if a power of @xmath0 higher than @xmath8 dominates at some point then the generic behaviour of expanding solutions is to higher @xmath0 .",
    "if a power of @xmath0 lower than @xmath8 dominates , then the trend is to lower @xmath0 .",
    "a term @xmath8 in the lagrangian is then a special case ; if it dominates then the expanding attractor corresponds to exponential growth , and acts as a separatrix between the higher or lower powers of @xmath0 dominating the future dynamics of the universe . those solutions with low @xmath0 dominating at late - times",
    "expand eternally , while those with high @xmath0 dominating approach either a big - rip singularity , or exponential expansion .",
    "big - rips often occur if there exists a single power of @xmath0 that dominates at late times , and exponential expansion occurs if @xmath200 , as is the case for some infinite power series , such as @xmath201",
    ". this late - time acceleration does not appear to be a good candidate for the apparent acceleration we observe , however , as it can not follow from a period of einstein - hilbert domination in which @xmath4 .",
    "the asymptotic past of the general solutions is similarly complicated .",
    "a variety of behaviours seems possible , including big - bang singularities and bounces , where the scale factor reaches a non - zero minimum .",
    "big - bang singularities are often approached with the scale - factor behaving as in the tolman solution , ( [ radiation ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that even trajectories which undergo an early period of inflation ( such as those solutions in which a power of @xmath8 dominates at some point ) do not generically follow such expansion indefinitely into the past , but rather have a big bang or bounce at some point in their past , prior to the onset of inflation .    while the behaviour found here",
    "is quite complicated , with numerous different asymptotes possible , it is certainly not the most general case that one may consider .",
    "we have limited ourselves here to spatially flat frw universes .",
    "relinquishing the criterion of spatial flatness would lead to more complicated behaviours still , and one may also consider inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic cosmologies , or cosmologies with multiple fluids .",
    "it is not clear whether or not the behaviour identified above would hold in these more general cases or not .",
    "what does seem clear , however , is that the simple picture of the highest powers of @xmath0 dominating at early times , and lower powers dominating at late times , is unlikely to be accurate .",
    "when @xmath204 or @xmath78 the vacuum dominated solutions take an exponential form @xmath205 , instead of the usual power - law form , ( [ vacuum ] ) . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath206 does not diverge to @xmath68 , and so the stability analysis must be modified from the power - law case .",
    "we will investigate the stability of these solutions here .      in the vacuum cosmologies , considered in section 3 ,",
    "points @xmath84 and @xmath85 correspond to exponential expansion when @xmath207 or @xmath78 .",
    "consider first the case @xmath207 .",
    "perturbing @xmath208 and @xmath209 we then have that the evolution equations ( [ theta ] ) and ( [ r ] ) are , to linear order , @xmath210 where the upper branch corresponds to point @xmath84 , and the lower branch to point @xmath85 .",
    "it can now be seen that the eigenvalues to the equations @xmath211 and @xmath212 are given by the two roots of @xmath213 on recognising that these solutions have @xmath214 , it can be seen that if @xmath215 then both points are saddles . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath216 then point @xmath84 is stable , while point @xmath85 is unstable . we will also be interested in the case when @xmath217 .",
    "point @xmath84 is then stable in @xmath62 , while @xmath218 .",
    "small fluctuations ( as one would expect to occur in a thermal de sitter space such as this ) will then gradually shift the value of @xmath54 . unless the theory has @xmath219 for all @xmath54 , there will then come a time at which @xmath220 , after which the point becomes an attractor proper , or a saddle , depending on the sign of @xmath221 .",
    "we will refer to this situation of temporary stability , followed by saddle behaviour , as ` semi - stable ' .",
    "now consider the case @xmath222 .",
    "in this case it is instructive to use the definitions of @xmath136 and @xmath65 to see that @xmath223 for @xmath224 we then have that @xmath222 corresponds to @xmath225 .",
    "perturbing @xmath62 and @xmath54 , as before , we then find that the linearised evolution equations become @xmath226 so that the relevant eigenvalues are given as the roots of @xmath227 again , @xmath214 , so the condition for points @xmath84 and @xmath85 to be saddles is now @xmath228 . if @xmath229 then point @xmath84 is an attractor , and point @xmath85 a repellor . now , if @xmath230 , then point @xmath84 can be semi - stable , depending on the sign of @xmath231 .      in the perfect fluid cosmologies",
    "we also find that the vacuum dominated solution corresponds to exponential expansion when @xmath232 or @xmath78 .",
    "consider first the case @xmath207 . in this case",
    "a perturbative expansion in @xmath233 and @xmath54 gives the evolution equations ( [ dyn4 ] ) , ( [ rprime ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) , to linear order , as @xmath234 where the upper sign is for point @xmath84 and the lower sign for point @xmath85 .",
    "we are now looking for eigenvalues , @xmath235 , such that @xmath236 if both of these eigenvalues are negative , and @xmath237 , then the point is stable .",
    "if they are both positive , and @xmath238 , then the point is unstable . any other combination",
    "we will call a saddle point .",
    "the values of @xmath235 can be seen to be given by the roots of @xmath239 it can then be seen that for @xmath177 both points are saddles , while for @xmath216 point @xmath84 is stable and point @xmath85 is unstable .",
    "@xmath240 again corresponds to point @xmath84 being semi - stable .",
    "the stability properties of points @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the presence of a perfect fluid when @xmath207 are therefore identical to the corresponding points in the vacuum cosmologies , considered above .    finally , consider the case @xmath222 .",
    "equation ( [ ab ] ) shows that in this limit we again have @xmath225 .",
    "the perturbed evolution equations are then given as @xmath241 where upper signs correspond to point @xmath84 , and lower signs to point @xmath85 .",
    "the eigenvalues , @xmath235 , are now given by the roots of @xmath242 for @xmath228 both of points @xmath84 and @xmath85 are saddles , while for @xmath229 point @xmath84 is stable and point @xmath85 is unstable .",
