    "since the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0@xcite many important properties have already been measured , particularly outside the regime where thermal fluctuations dominate .",
    "the observation of thermal fluctuation effects have been limited in conventional low-@xmath14 superconductors because the large correlation volume makes these effects very small compared to the mean - field behavior . by contrast , the high transition temperature @xmath14 and small correlation volume in a variety of cuprate superconductors lead to significant fluctuation effects@xcite . in mgb@xmath0",
    "the correlation volume and @xmath14 lie between these extremes , suggesting that fluctuation effects will be observable .",
    "indeed , excess magnetoconductance@xcite , fluctuation effects in the specific heat@xcite , and fluctuating diamagnetic magnetization@xcite was observed recently in powder samples .",
    "here we report and analyze reversible magnetization data of a high quality mgb@xmath0 single crystal in the vicinity of the zero field transition temperature , @xmath1 k , at several magnetic fields up to @xmath2 oe , applied along the @xmath3-axis . though mgb@xmath0 is a two gap superconductor our scaling analysis uncovers below @xmath14 remarkable consistency with 3d - xy critical behavior , revealing that the order parameter is a single complex scalar as in @xmath4he .",
    "the high quality of the single crystal made it possible to enter this regime .",
    "for this reason the magnetic field induced finite size effect , whereupon the correlation length transverse to the applied magnetic field can not grow beyond the limiting magnetic length @xmath7 , with the magnetic field @xmath5 applied along the @xmath6-axis and @xmath8 , could be verified and studied in detail .",
    "@xmath17 is related to the average distance between vortex lines .",
    "indeed , as the magnetic field increases , the density of vortex lines becomes greater , but this can not continue indefinitely , the limit is roughly set on the proximity of vortex lines by the overlapping of their cores .",
    "this finite size effect implies that in type ii superconductors , superconductivity in a magnetic field is confined to cylinders with diameter @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly , there is below @xmath14 the 3d to 1d crossover line @xmath21 with @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the critical amplitudes of the correlation lengths above ( @xmath12 ) and below ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 along the respective axis .",

    "furthermore , our analysis of the magnetization data of lascialfari _",
    "et al_.@xcite taken on a mgb@xmath0 powder sample also confirms that there is a magnetic field induced finite size effect above @xmath14 as well .",
    "it leads to the line @xmath23 , where the 3d to 1d crossover occurs and the uncondensed pairs are forced to confine in cylinders .    the paper is organized as follows : next we sketch the scaling theory appropriate for a neutral type ii superconductor with a single complex scalar order parameter falling in the absence of a magnetic field onto the 3d - xy universality class .",
    "section ii is devoted to experimental details , the presentation of our magnetization data for @xmath24 , their analysis by means of the scaling theory and the analysis of the magnetization data of lascialfari _",

    "though mgb@xmath0 is a two gap superconductor an effective one gap description appears to apply sufficiently close to @xmath14@xcite .",
    "as we concentrate on the effects of thermal fluctuations in the presence of comparatively low magnetic fields we adopt this effective one gap description .",
    "accordingly , the order parameter is assumed to be a single complex scalar . to derive the scaling form of the magnetization in the fluctuation dominated regime we note that the scaling of the magnetic field is in terms of the number of flux quanta per correlation area .",
    "thus , when the thermal fluctuations of the order parameter dominate the singular part of the free energy per unit volume of a homogeneous system scales as @xcite @xmath26 @xmath27 is a universal constant and @xmath28 a universal scaling function of its argument , with @xmath29 .",

    "they provide the basis to extract from experimental data the doping dependence of the non - universal critical properties , including the transition temperature @xmath14 , the critical amplitudes of correlation lengths @xmath48 , the anisotropy @xmath49 , _",
    "etc_. , while the universal relations are independent of the doping level .    in practice",
    ", however , there are limitations set by the presence of disorder , inhomogeneities and the magnetic field induced finite size effect .",
    "nevertheless , as cuprate superconductors are concerned there is considerable evidence for 3d - xy critical behavior , except for a rounded transition close to @xmath14 @xcite . as disorder",
    "is concerned there is the harris criterion @xcite , which states that short - range correlated and uncorrelated disorder is irrelevant at the unperturbed critical point , provided that the specific heat exponent @xmath50 is negative . since in the 3d - xy universality class @xmath50 is negative ( [ eq3 ] ) , disorder is not expected to play an essential role .",
    "however , when superconductivity is restricted to homogeneous domains of finite spatial extent @xmath51 , the system is inhomogeneous and the resulting rounded transition uncovers a finite size effect @xcite because the correlation lengths @xmath52 can not grow beyond @xmath51 , the respective extent of the homogenous domains .",
    "hence , as long as @xmath53 the critical properties of the fictitious homogeneous system can be explored .",
    "there is considerable evidence that this scenario accounts for the rounded transition seen in the specific heat @xcite and the magnetic penetration depths @xcite . in type",
    "ii superconductors , exposed to a magnetic field @xmath5 , there is an additional limiting length scale @xmath54 with @xmath8@xcite , related to the average distance between vortex lines@xcite . indeed ,",
    "as the density of vortex lines becomes greater with increasing magnetic field , this can not continue indefinitely .",
    "the limit is roughly set on the proximity of vortex lines by the overlapping of their cores . due to these limiting lengths",
    "the correlation lengths can not grow beyond@xcite @xmath55 where @xmath10 .",
    "as the magnetization is concerned the inhomogeneity induced finite size effect is expected to set in close to @xmath14 where @xmath56 approaches @xmath51 , while for a field applied along the c - axis , the magnetic finite size effect dominates when @xmath57 .",
    "accordingly , sufficiently extended magnetization measurements are not expected to provide estimates for the critical properties of the associated fictitious homogeneous system only , but do have the potential to uncover inhomogeneities giving rise to a finite size effect as well . as a unique size of the homogeneous domains is unlikely , the smallest extent will set the scale where the growth of the respective correlation length starts to deviate from the critical behavior of the homogenous counterpart .    to recognize the implications of the magnetic field induced finite size effect , it is instructive to note that the scaling form of the singular part of the free energy per unit volume , ( [ eq1 ] ) , is formally equivalent to an uncharged superfluid , such as @xmath4he , constrained to a cylinder of diameter @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , the finite size scaling theory predicts , that in a system confined to a barlike geometry , @xmath59 , with @xmath60 , an observable @xmath61 scales as@xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the finite size scaling function . as in the confined system a 3d to 1d",
