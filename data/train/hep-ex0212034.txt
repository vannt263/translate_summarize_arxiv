    "new family of radiation detector designs , generally referred to as micropattern gas detectors ( mpgds ) @xcite has emerged during the last fifteen years in response to the demanding needs ( fast counting rate , radiation resistance , high spatial resolution ) of next - generation high energy physics experiments . while the specific design varies , their common principle is a sizeable voltage drop across microstructures immersed in a suitable gas mixture : electrons originating from particle ionization in a conversion volume are multiplied in the microstructures , where amplification gains of up to @xmath2 are obtained .",
    "a popular example of a mpgd is the micromegas design ( micromesh gaseous structure ) , a concept recently put forward by y. giomataris , g. charpak and collaborators @xcite .",
    "this two - stage parallel - plate avalanche chamber consists of a 100 @xmath3 m narrow amplification gap and a large conversion region -tpc volumes are possible- , separated by a gauze - like electroformed conducting micromesh .",
    "electrons released by ionizing particles in the gas - filled conversion region are drifted towards the amplification gap where they multiply in an avalanche process .",
    "detectable signals are then induced on anode elements .",
    "a second example of mpgds are gas electron multipliers ( gems)@xcite , developed at cern by f. sauli and collaborators : small holes ( diameter@xmath4 ) are photolithographically etched on a @xmath5-thick kapton film copper - clad on both sides and a voltage difference of @xmath6 v is generated across the gem .",
    "the high density of electric field lines within the perforations induces the sought avalanche .",
    "an advantage of gems is the possibility of building multi - stage amplification layers @xcite , allowing for very large gains .",
    "the high - efficiency detection of single electrons at gas pressures of up to 20 atm has been achieved in a variety of mpgds @xcite .",
    "the effective energy threshold in these devices is the ionization energy of the gas mixture , i.e. , a few tens of ev .",
    "=    =    the possibility of exploiting some of the features specific to mpgds in a new realm , that of searches for rare - events in neutrino and astroparticle physics has been recently examined @xcite .",
    "the properties of these devices ( background rejection capabilities , demonstrated ability for single - electron detection , versatility and simplicity ) suggest a means to tackle a long - standing experimental challenge , the measurement of _ coherent _ neutral - current neutrino - nucleus scattering . an uncontroversial process in the standard model , the scattering off nuclei of low - energy neutrinos ( @xmath7 few tens of mev , e.g. , reactor @xmath8 ) via the neutral current @xcite remains undetected .",
    "the long neutrino wavelength probes the entire nucleus , giving rise to a large coherent enhancement in the cross section , roughly proportional to neutron number squared @xcite . using this mode of interaction , it would be possible to speak of _ portable _ neutrino detectors : in some experimental conditions the expected rates can be as high as several hundred recoils / kg / day , by no means a `` rare - event '' situation .",
    "however , the recoil energy transferred to the target is a few kev at most even for the lightest nuclei , with only a few percent going into ionization ( ) .",
    "the interest in observing this process is not merely academic : a neutral - current detector responds the same way to all known neutrino types .",
    "therefore , the observation of neutrino oscillations in such a device would be _ direct _ evidence for a fourth sterile neutrino .",
    "these can be invoked if all recently observed neutrino anomalies are accepted at face value @xcite and may play an important role as dark matter @xcite .",
    "separately , the cross section for this process is critically dependent on neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "agreement with the standard model prediction would _ per se _ largely improve on the present experimental sensitivity to @xmath9@xcite .",
    "in addition to this , a measurement of the cross section would constitute a sensitive probe of the weak nuclear charge , testing radiative corrections due to new physics above the weak scale with a sensitivity comparable to atomic parity violation and accelerator experiments .",
    "statistically speaking , this can be accomplished in a nuclear reactor already with a modest detector mass and a short exposure @xcite .",
    "finally , this coherent mechanism plays a most important role in neutrino dynamics in supernovae and neutron stars @xcite , adding to the attraction of a laboratory measurement of this cross section .",
    "in particular , a measurement of the _ total _ ( flavor - independent ) neutrino flux from a nearby supernova using a large enough coherent detector would be of capital importance to help clarify the exact oscillation pattern followed by the neutrinos in their way to the earth @xcite .",
    "=    =    =    until now , no existing device had met the mass and energy threshold requirements involved in this measurement , even though unrealized cryogenic proposals abound @xcite . a considerable fraction of the neutrino signal in a reactor experiment is nevertheless expected above mpgd energy thresholds ( fig .",
    "2 ) . structurally simple mpgd - based coherent neutrino detectors would open the door to more mundane but no less important applications than those listed above ( `` neutrino technology '' ?",
    "@xcite ) : for instance , nonintrusive monitoring of nuclear reactors against illegitimate uses ( e.g. , fuel rod diversion , unauthorized production of weapon - grade material ) with a compact device , potentially improving on existing proposals that rely on standard neutrino detectors and processes @xcite ( fig .",
    "we have recently commenced fabrication and characterization of radioclean mpgds with a first goal of coherent neutrino detection while keeping in mind other possible applications of the same devices , e.g. , weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) searches .",
    "three techniques are currently being pursued in parallel : use of a micromegas backpanel as a proportional - scintillation reflector , multi - stage gas electron multipliers ( gems ) and large electron multipliers ( lems ) .",
    "the last are similar to gems but with all dimensions increased by a factor of ten",
    ". the use of lems may be advantageous in applications like the present one where no spatial information is required and only modest energy resolution is needed . as",
    "a trade - off they offer a larger resistance against discharge - induced damage than gems , due to their reduced capacitance , and the simplicity that comes with their being self - supporting ( no careful mounting and stretching on a frame is needed as in the case of gems ) .",
    "lems have been previously considered in the context of large tpcs and wimp detectors @xcite .",
    "several lem prototypes ranging in thickness from 0.25 to 0.75 mm ( fig .",
    "4 ) have been micromachined at the enrico fermi institute ( efi ) from low - activity materials ( 10 @xmath3 m ofhc copper plated directly onto virgin teflon ) and have undergone satisfactory preliminary tests at purdue .",
    "first measurements on single lems are encouraging : only a modest increase in voltage is needed to produce gains similar to gems ( ) , most probably due to the longer avalanche regions .",
    "they nevertheless exhibit a diminished energy resolution in comparison to gems ( ) . while more detailed studies are underway",
    ", we can hypothesize that this effect is due to a large fraction of primary ionizations taking place within the lem holes ( in these calibrations the conversion volume was small , a 0.5 cm drift distance ) .",
    "if this is the case , the resolution is expected to improve for larger tpc volumes . as expected ,",
    "the rise time of the signal is also slower than in gems , an effect unimportant for most low - counting rate applications ( ) .",
    "it is also observed that the leakage current across these lems is of only a few pa @ 2000 v , whereas typical gems exhibit values in the few na @ @xmath10500 v ( the volume resistivity of teflon is @xmath11 ohm@xmath12 cm while this is @xmath13 ohm@xmath12 cm in kapton ) .",
    "a second production of lems using a polyetheretherketone substrate is underway ( polyetheretherketone exhibits an even lower outgassing than teflon ) .",
    "separately , sixty 16x16  gem panels ( for a total of 1980 gem elements ) have been produced in collaboration with 3 m @xcite using their proprietary reel - to - reel flex technology @xcite ( ) . this is the first instance of gem industrial mass production : until now gems have been available exclusively from cern , generally in small surface areas most suitable for r&d .",
    "two different techniques ( additive and subtractive copper cladding ) have been tested , with a third one under production .",
    "a large variety of finishings and treatments is possible from 3 m s production line : for instance , the periphery of each gem element within a panel can be perforated for easy detachment .",
    "any gem pattern is possible , up to a 12x12  size . at the time of this writing the first batch is undergoing testing at efi .",
    "their characterization will be the subject of an upcoming publication .",
    "@xmath14 a calibration facility to provide monochromatic ( filtered ) neutron @xcite beams able to produce recoils almost identical to those expected from reactor antineutrinos ( ) is to be built at the intense pulsed neutron source ( argonne national laboratory ) .",
    "these measurements will provide not only a convincing proof of the ability of mpgds to detect these low - energy signals , but also a chance to characterize the low - energy quenching factors and thresholds for different gas mixtures as well as the attainable gain as a function of gas pressure .",
    "this information is of the utmost importance for the interpretation of a subsequent neutrino experiment .",
    "the same facility can be later employed to characterize wimp detectors .",
    "a second calibration setup presently under construction uses well - defined monochromatic daughter recoils from the xe(n@xmath15 reaction , ranging in energy from 140 ev to 350 ev ( ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that a careful selection of materials can ensure a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "thermal neutron absorption has been used before to study quenching factors in ge for recoil energies down to 250 ev @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 an interesting intermediate physics result is expected from measurements of intrinsic detector backgrounds , to take place at a depth of 60 m.w.e . in the low - background laboratory at efi .",
    "a four - liter ofhc cu prototype is under construction for this purpose .",
    "this unique combination of shielding against cosmic rays , sizeable target mass ( @xmath16 g ) and ultra - low energy threshold should return an improvement of several orders of magnitude on the present experimental sensitivity to a slow solar - bound wimp population @xcite and to recently proposed non - pointlike dark matter particle candidates @xcite . while the nature of radioactive backgrounds below @xmath101 kev is a true _ terra incognita _ for large devices , experience in wimp detector development indicates that no sudden rise is expected in this energy region from known natural sources .",
    "low - energy neutron recoils and recoiling daughters from ( n@xmath15 can be controlled with layers of moderating and absorbing shielding . degraded @xmath17 and @xmath18 radiations from surfaces can be kept to a minimum using radioclean materials in the detector construction .",
    "similarly , if the need ever arises , it should be possible to reduce spurious single - electron emission from malter and field effects down to a negligible level via surface treatment ( as in accelerating rf - gun cavities ) and rigorous control of gas composition and purity .",
