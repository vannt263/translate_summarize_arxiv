    "we are interested in the following semilinear heat equation : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 denotes the laplacian in @xmath20 , and @xmath4 or @xmath21 if @xmath22 .",
    "it is well known that for each initial data @xmath23 the cauchy problem has a unique solution @xmath24 for some @xmath25 , and that either @xmath26 or @xmath27 in the latter case we say that the solution blows up in finite time , and @xmath28 is called the blow - up time .",
    "in such a blow - up case , a point @xmath29 is called a blow - up point if @xmath0 is not locally bounded in some neighborhood of @xmath30 , this means that there exists @xmath31 such that @xmath32 when @xmath33 .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the blow - up set , that is the set of all blow - up points of @xmath7 .",
    "given @xmath34 , we know from velzquez @xcite ( see also filippas and kohn @xcite , filippas and liu @xcite , herrero and velzquez @xcite , merle and zaag @xcite ) that up to replacing @xmath7 by @xmath35 , one of following two cases occurs :    - case 1 ( non degenerate rate of blow - up ) : for all @xmath36 , there is an orthonormal @xmath37 matrix @xmath38 and @xmath39 such that @xmath40 where @xmath41    - case 2 ( degenerate rate of blow - up ) : for all @xmath42 , there exists an even integer @xmath43 such that @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 if @xmath47 and @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .",
    "+ according to velzquez @xcite , if case 1 occurs with @xmath50 or case 2 occurs with @xmath51 for all @xmath52 , then @xmath53 is an isolated blow - up point .",
    "herrero and velzquez @xcite and @xcite proved that the profile with @xmath50 is generic in the case @xmath54 , and they announced the same for @xmath55 , but they never published it .",
    "bricmont and kupiainen @xcite , merle and zaag @xcite show the existence of initial data for such that the corresponding solutions blow up in finite time @xmath28 at only one blow - up point @xmath53 and verify the behavior with @xmath50 .",
    "the method of @xcite also gives the stability of the profile ( @xmath50 ) with respect to perturbations in the initial data ( see also fermanian , merle and zaag @xcite , @xcite for other proofs of the stability ) . in @xcite and @xcite , the authors prove the stability of the profile ( @xmath50 ) with respect to perturbations in the initial data and also in the nonlinearity , in some class allowing lower order terms in the solution and also in the gradient .",
    "all the other asymptotic behaviors are suspected to be unstable .",

    "the first relevant result is due to velzquez @xcite where the author showed that the hausdorff measure of @xmath8 is less or equal to @xmath57 .",
    "no further results on the description of @xmath8 were known until the contributions of zaag @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite for a summarized note ) . in @xcite",
    ", the author proves that if @xmath8 is locally continuous , then @xmath8 is a @xmath58 manifold .",
    "he also obtains the first singularity description near @xmath53 .",
    "more precisely , he shows that ( see theorems 3 and 4 in @xcite ) for some @xmath59 and @xmath60 , for all @xmath36 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 such that @xmath63 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is defined in ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "moreover , for all @xmath67 , @xmath68 as @xmath69 with @xmath70 if @xmath71 zaag in @xcite further refines the asymptotic behavior and gets to error terms of order @xmath72 for some @xmath14 .",
    "this way , he obtains more regularity on the blow - up set @xmath8 . the key idea is to replace the explicit profile @xmath65 in by a non - explicit function , say @xmath73 , then to go beyond all logarithmic scales through scaling and matching .",
    "in fact , for @xmath73 , zaag takes a symmetric , one dimensional solution of that blows up at the same time @xmath28 only at the origin , and behaves like with @xmath66 .",
    "more precisely , he abandons the explicit profile function @xmath65 in and chooses a non explicit function @xmath74 as a first order description of the singular behavior , where @xmath75 is defined by @xmath76 he shows that for each blow - up point @xmath77 near @xmath53 , there is an optimal scaling parameter @xmath78 so that the difference @xmath79 along the normal direction to @xmath8 at @xmath77 is minimum .",

    "more precisely , for all @xmath61 and @xmath62 such that @xmath63 , @xmath82 for some @xmath14 . note that any other value of @xmath83 in gives an error of logarithmic order of the variable @xmath12 ( the same as in ) . exploiting estimate yields geometric constraints on @xmath8 which imply the @xmath84-regularity of @xmath8 for all @xmath85 .",
    "a further refinement of given in @xcite yields better estimates in the expansion of @xmath0 near @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , some following terms in the expansion of @xmath0 near @xmath81 contain geometrical descriptions of @xmath8 , resulting in more regularity of @xmath8 , namely the @xmath11-regularity .",
    "+ in this work , we want to know whether the @xmath11-regularity near @xmath53 proven in @xcite for @xmath66 would hold in the case where @xmath7 behaves like near @xmath30 with @xmath86 since the author in @xcite and @xcite obtains the result only when @xmath66 , this corresponds to @xmath87-dimensional blow - up set ( the codimension of the blow - up set is one , according to @xcite ) . in our opinion , in those papers the major obstacle towards the case lays in the fact that the author could not refine the asymptotic behavior with @xmath88 to go beyond all logarithmic scales and get a smaller error term in polynomial orders of the variable @xmath12 .",
    "it happens that a similar difficulty was already encountered by fermanian and zaag in @xcite , when they wanted to find a sharp profile in the case with @xmath50 , which corresponds to an isolated blow - up point , as we have pointed out right after estimate .",
    "such a sharp profile could be obtained in @xcite only when @xmath89 ( which corresponds also to @xmath90 ) : no surprise it was @xmath91 , the dilated version of @xmath92 , the one - dimensional blow - up solution mentioned between estimates and . as a matter of fact",
    ", the use of @xmath92 was first used in @xcite for the isolated blow - up point in one space dimension ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) , then later in higher dimensions with a @xmath87 dimensional blow - up surface ( @xmath93 and still @xmath90 ) in @xcite .",
    "the interest of @xmath92 is that it provides a one - parameter family of blow - up solutions , thanks to the scaling parameter in , which enables to get the sharp profile by suitably choosing the parameter .",
    "handling the case @xmath94 remained open , both for the case of an isolated point ( @xmath95 ) and a non - isolated blow - up point ( @xmath96 ) . from the refinement of the expansion around the explicit profile in @xmath97 in",
    ", it appeared than one needs a @xmath98-parameter family of blow - up solutions obeying .",
    "such a family was constructed by nguyen and zaag in @xcite , and successfully used to derive a sharp profile in the case of an isolated blow - up point ( @xmath99 ) , by fine - tuning the @xmath100 parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at using that family to handle the case of a non - isolated blow - up point ( @xmath93 and @xmath101 ) , in order to generalize the results of zaag in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , proving in particular the @xmath102 regularity of the blow - up set , under the mere hypothesis that it is continuous .",
    "the main result in this paper is the following .",
    "[ theo:1 ] take @xmath55 and @xmath103 .",
    "consider @xmath7 a solution of that blows up in finite time @xmath28 on a set @xmath8 and take @xmath34 where @xmath7 behaves locally as stated in with @xmath104 .",
    "if @xmath8 is locally a @xmath58 manifold of dimension @xmath105 , then it is locally @xmath11 .",
    "theorem [ theo:1 ] was already proved by zaag @xcite only when @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the novelty of our contribution lays in the case @xmath107 and @xmath22 .    under the hypotheses of theorem [ theo:1 ]",
    ", zaag @xcite already proved that @xmath8 is a @xmath58 manifold near @xmath53 , assuming that @xmath8 is continuous .",
    "therefore , theorem [ theo:1 ] can be restated under a weaker assumption . before stating this stronger version ,",
    "let us first clearly describe our hypotheses and introduce some terminologies borrowed from @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "according to velzquez @xcite ( see theorem 2 , page 1571 ) , we know that for all @xmath108 , there is @xmath109 such that    @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the orthogonal projection over @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the so - called `` weak '' tangent plane to @xmath8 at @xmath53 . roughly speaking , @xmath114 is a cone with vertex @xmath53 and shrinks to @xmath112 as @xmath115 .",

    "we assume in addition that @xmath53 is not an endpoint in @xmath124 in the sense that @xmath125    this is the stronger version of our result :    * theorem [ theo:1]. * _ take @xmath55 and @xmath103 .",

    "+ let us now briefly give the main ideas of the proof of theorem [ theo:1 ] . the proof is based on techniques developed by zaag in @xcite and @xcite for the case when the solution of equation behaves like with @xmath132 . as in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the proof relies on two arguments :    * the derivation of a sharp blow - up profile of @xmath0 near the singularity , in the sense that the difference between the solution @xmath0 and this sharp profile goes beyond all logarithmic scales of the variables @xmath12 .",
    "this is possible thanks to the recent result in @xcite . * the derivation of a refined asymptotic profile of @xmath0 near the singularity linked to geometric constraints on the blow - up set .",
    "in fact , we derive an asymptotic profile for @xmath0 in every ball @xmath133 for some @xmath36 and @xmath77 a blow - up point close to @xmath53 . moreover , this profile is continuous in @xmath77 and the speed of convergence of @xmath7 to each one in the ball @xmath133 is uniform with respect to @xmath77 . if @xmath77 and @xmath123 are in @xmath8 and @xmath134 , then the balls @xmath133 and @xmath135 intersect each other , leading to different profiles for @xmath0 in the intersection .",
    "however , these profiles have to coincide , up to the error terms .",
    "this makes a geometric constraint which gives more regularity for the blow - up set near @xmath53 .",
    "let us explain the difficulty raised in @xcite and @xcite for the case @xmath136 .",
    "consider @xmath137 for some @xmath60 and introduce the following self - similar variables : @xmath138 then , we see from that for all @xmath139 , @xmath140 under the hypotheses stated in theorem [ theo:1 ] , zaag @xcite proved in proposition 3.1 , page 513 and in section 6.1 , pages 530 - 533 that for all @xmath141 for some @xmath142 and @xmath143 , there exists an @xmath144 orthogonal matrix @xmath145 such that @xmath146 where @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath145 is continuous in terms of @xmath77 such that @xmath149 spans the tangent plane @xmath150 to @xmath8 at @xmath77 and @xmath151 are the normal directions to @xmath8 at @xmath77 , @xmath152 is the weighted @xmath153 space associated with the weight @xmath154 . note that the estimate implies ( see appendix c in @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath106 , in order to refine estimate , the author in @xcite subtracts from @xmath155 a 1-dimensional solution with the same profile .",
    "let us do the same when @xmath156 , and explain how the author succeeds in handing the case @xmath132 and gets stuck when @xmath136 . to this end , we consider @xmath157 with @xmath158 a radially symmetric solution of in @xmath159 which blows up at time @xmath28 only at the origin with the profile with @xmath104 ( see appendix a.1 in @xcite for the existence of such a solution ) . if the @xmath160-dimensional solution @xmath161 is considered in @xmath162 , then it blows up on the @xmath9 vector space @xmath163 in @xmath162 .",
