    "the mbl state undergoes a transition to an ergodic state . across this transition , the distribution of level - spacing statistics of the full spectrum changes@xcite",
    "this implies a need to develop analytical tools that address the full spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "the daunting task of accounting for the behavior of excited states anywhere in the spectrum requires a scheme that extracts the important elements in the hilbert space and the hamiltonian .",
