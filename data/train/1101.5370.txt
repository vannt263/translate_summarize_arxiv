    "it has been argued@xcite that the fundamental length scale of quantum spacetime need not be given by the planck length , @xmath4 , but may correspond to a new fundamental constant of nature , @xmath5 .",
    "this would then suggest that newton s gravitational coupling constant @xmath0 becomes calculable in terms of the fundamental constants @xmath6 ( velocity of light in vacuum ) , @xmath7 ( planck s quantum of action ) , and @xmath5 ( the hypothetical quantum of length ) .",
    "stimulus for a calculation of @xmath0 was provided by the approach of verlinde@xcite to consider the newtonian gravitational attraction as a type of entropic force , with the fundamental microscopic degrees of freedom living on a two - dimensional screen , in line with the so - called holographic principle.@xcite following this approach and using the bekenstein  hawking black - hole entropy@xcite as input , a single transcendental equation can be derived , which fixes the numerical factor @xmath8 entering the @xmath0 expression.@xcite    now , it is possible to make further progress by combining two recent suggestions .",
    "the first is by sahlmann ( last paragraph in ref .  )",
    "that the internal hilbert - space dimension of the `` atom of two - dimensional space , '' corresponding to the `` quantum of area '' @xmath3 , may very well need to be integer and that this places further restrictions on the microscopic theory .",
    "the second is by neto@xcite that the microscopic degrees of freedom on the holographic screen may have a modified energy equipartition law .",
    "such a behavior may result from a generalization of the standard boltzmann - gibbs statistics,@xcite but it may also have an entirely different origin .",
    "( the important role of the equipartition law has previously been emphasized in , e.g. , ref .  .",
    ")    prompted by these two suggestions , a new calculation of @xmath0 is presented in this paper .",
    "in addition , a physical interpretation of the result can be given , which is based on the verlinde approach to the origin of gravity .",
    "this section gives a purely combinatorial calculation of the numerical factor @xmath8 entering the general expression for the gravitational coupling constant : @xmath9 where @xmath3 is considered to be a new fundamental constant of nature with the dimension of area .",
    "incidentally , the notation @xmath10 will be kept for the experimental value of newton s gravitational coupling constant.@xcite    following sec .  4 of ref .  , there are two steps for the combinatorial calculation of @xmath8 .",
    "first , consider the event horizon of a large nonrotating ( schwarzschild ) black - hole and write the number of degrees of freedom on this surface ( with area @xmath11 ) as the product of two dimensionless numbers , @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is interpreted as the number of distinguishable `` atoms of two - dimensional space '' making up the area ( @xmath3 being the quantum of area ) and @xmath1 as the dimension of the internal space of an individual atom :    [ eq : n - atom - d - atom ] @xmath14 \\label{eq : d - atom } d_\\mathsf{atom } & \\equiv & f^{-1}\\,i_{1}^{-1 } \\in \\mathbb{n}_1\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    compared to the analysis of ref .  , there are two new ingredients in : @xmath1 is no longer equal to @xmath15 and @xmath1 is demanded to be a positive integer .",
    "the factor @xmath16 in definition simply parameterizes the difference of @xmath1 and @xmath15 . for the moment",
    ", the origin and meaning of @xmath16 is left open ( one possible physical interpretation will be given in sec .",

    "one such `` atom '' will be said to contribute one `` quantum of area '' @xmath3 to a macroscopic surface .",
    "second , take as input the bekenstein  hawking formula@xcite for the entropy of a large ( macroscopic ) black - hole @xmath17 where has been used in the second step and and in the third step . equating the number of configurations of the distinguishable atoms of space from with the exponential of the bekenstein  hawking entropy gives the following set of conditions : @xmath18\\,,\\ ] ] for positive integers @xmath19 ( there may be significant corrections to the black - hole entropy for @xmath20 ; see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "the infinite set of conditions reduces , for given @xmath21 , to a single transcendental equation for @xmath1 ,    [ eq : datom - transcendental - eq - integer ] @xmath22 in addition , there is still the condition that the dimension of the internal space be a positive integer,@xcite @xmath23    note that has precisely the same form as eq .",

    "second , the required @xmath21 values for @xmath27 and @xmath28 are equal , but it is not clear if this carries over to generalized models ( for example , those of ref .  ) .",

    "the fundamental microscopic theory will have to decide which value of @xmath31 appears in .",

    "the following numerical estimate of the smallest possible quantum of area is obtained : @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "not surprisingly , this particular value of the quantum of area has already been given in an earlier article by t hooft.@xcite here , there is the further result that the dimension @xmath36 is ruled out on physics grounds , leaving @xmath32 as the lowest possible value and allowing for the storage of information ( `` bits '' ) on a holographic screen.@xcite    expression for @xmath0 is the main result of this paper . the crucial eqs .",

    "systems of atoms with @xmath72 have unusual ( most likely , unacceptable ) thermodynamics , with , for example , a convex entropy.@xcite    if the modified equipartition law is indeed due to a form of nonstandard statistics as suggested in the previous paragraph , then the following question arises : how does the nonextensive entropy @xmath68 of a relatively small number of atoms of space combine into the extensive bekenstein  hawking entropy @xmath73 of a macroscopic black hole ?",
