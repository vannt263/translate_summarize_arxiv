    "the x - ray emitting gas in the centre of many galaxy clusters has a cooling time less than the hubble time .",
    "supported by large central concentrations in the surface brightness profile , early models of cluster evolution posited that cooling gas is funneled onto the central galaxy in the form of a cooling flow , ultimately resulting in a cooling catastrophe as more and more gas condenses out of the hot phase ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "however , high - resolution spectra of clusters show a lack of cool gas below a temperature floor of about one third of the virial temperature ( @xmath5  kev ) and a lack of star formation at the levels expected for the early estimates of cooling rates in excess of 100 solar masses per year in powerful cooling flows ( e.g. , peterson et al . 2001 ; fabian et al . 2001 ; kaastra et al .",
    "2001 ; tamura et al .",
    "the most natural interpretation is that some source of heat is preventing the gas from cooling .",
    "the heat source must respond to the cooling rate of the cluster gas in such a way that heating and cooling are balanced , on average , in a self - regulating feedback cycle .",
    "many different mechanisms for heating in clusters have been proposed , including agn outflows , thermal conduction , dynamical friction , gravitational heating , cosmic rays and preheating , each either alone or in combination ( see conroy & ostriker 2008 ; brighenti & mathews 2002 for reviews ) .",
    "however , recent studies have found evidence for agn activity in the central galaxy of nearly all cooling - core clusters ( burns 1990 ; mittal et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the now widely accepted picture is that radio - loud agn inflate bubbles of under - dense , relativistic plasma which displaces the local icm .",

    "2004 ; dunn & fabian 2004 ; rafferty et al .",

    "although it is possible that agn outflows are not solely or primarily responsible for cluster feedback , understanding how agn interact with the cluster environment is still necessary to understand how clusters evolve .",
    "interactions with the cluster environment can have an effect on other types of cluster heating .",
    "recent work by parrish et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and ruszkowski & oh ( 2010 ) has found that turbulence in the cluster above a threshold value can suppress the heat - flux - driven buoyancy instability which would other wise inhibit thermal conduction .",
    "turbulence can , therefore , allow efficient thermal conduction to occur , so it is important to understand the velocity structure of the cluster and how agn alter that structure .",
    "the details of how an agn delivers energy to the cluster are still largely unknown .",
    "simulations of agn jets or hot , under - dense bubble in idealized , spherically symmetric clusters have found that energy is confined to a narrow angle around the jet axis , rather than being spread throughout the cluster ( e.g. churazov et al . 2001 ; reynolds et al . 2001 ; saxton et al .",

    "turbulence produced by rt instabilities has been shown to help in distributing energy and in producing a self - regulated agn jet ( scannapieco & brggen 2008 , brggen & scannapieco 2009 ) .    however , a simulation carried out by heinz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that in a realistic , cosmologically evolved cluster the motion of cluster gas effectively distributed the effects of the agn over a wide angle .",
    "there is also observational evidence for the misalignment of radio jets and x - ray cavities in abell 4059 , presumably due to bulk motions in the icm ( heinz et al .",
    "mhd simulations of clusters with agn and turbulence from star formation ( falceta - gonlaves et al .",
    "2010b ) were able to distribute agn energy isotropically and produce a filamentary structure similar to the observed in perseus .",

    ", we directly investigate the role of cluster weather and jet power , as well as the injection history , on the evolution of radio lobes and x - ray cavities in the icm .",
    "one critical question concerning the effect of jet activity is what the jet duty cycle is , i.e. , what fraction of the time a black hole at the centre of a cool core cluster is actively driving a jet . the average jet power is often used to estimate the amount of agn heating .",
    "however , the heating from a short , powerful period of agn activity could be different from a long - lived , low - luminosity agn that injects the same amount of total power .",

    "2007 ) , virgo ( forman et al . 2007 ) , and abell 262 ( clarke et al .",
    "the duty - cycle inferred from these observations has been taken as evidence for self - regulation between cooling of the central cluster gas and agn activity on timescales of tens of millions of years .",
    "similar arguments have been made on the basis of sound and shock waves observed in deep chandra observations of nearby clusters ( virgo , perseus ) , which associate an agn outburst with every ripple .",
    "as we will argue , the underlying assumption that surface brightness features can be associated one - to - one with activity in the central engine is likely overly optimistic .",
    "sternberg & soker ( 2009 ) have found that multiple sound waves can be excited by a single episode of bubble formation .",
    "falceta - gonlaves et al .",
    "( 2010a ) were able to create multiple bubbles in simulations of a precessing agn jet with a large precession angle .",

    "the paper is arranged as follows : section 2 describes the setup and technical details of our simulations , section 3 presents the results and discusses the implications for cluster heating and observations , section 4 presents a analytic toy model to estimate the characteristic timescale for an individual bubble form and break off from the jet , and section 5 presents a summary of our results and conclusions .",

    "our simulations include gravity from @xmath7 dark matter particles , advanced using a cosmological variable - time - step leapfrog method .",
    "gravity is computed by solving poisson s equation with a multigrid method using isolated boundary conditions .",
    "radiative cooling and star formation are not included in our simulations , but for the relatively short time simulated ( 200 myr ) these should not have a significant effect on the large scale evolution of the cluster and can be neglected .",

    "we find that the interaction of agn jets with the motion of cluster gas is critical for determining the evolution of both the cluster and radio lobes .",
    "in particular , we find that :    * multiple bubbles can be formed from a single period of agn activity with a constant luminosity .",
    "as the agn develops , bubbles can be broken off from the jet by the motion of gas within the cluster , leading to many generation of bubble formation .",
    "these bubbles can be pushed away from the jet axis by cluster weather .",
    "therefore , observations of multiple x - ray or radio bubbles in a cluster does not necessarily give you any information about the duty cycle of the agn or about the past alignment of the agn jet . *",
    "a toy model balancing pressure in an expanding cocoon against ram pressure due to circular motion in the cluster core provides a reasonable estimate for the timescale of bubble breakoff . * energy from the agn is distributed over all angles by large - scale motions in the cluster .",
    "jet material is distributed throughout the centre of the cluster and any information about the original orientation of the jet is lost on a time scale of about 100 myr .",
    "this is not the case in a hydrostatic cluster , where the absence of large - scale flows allows the jets to propagate without being deflected .",
    "* a jet of a given luminosity will create a low - density , high - entropy cavity that expands to a fixed radius and then stops , limited by the interaction with large - scale flows in the cluster .",
    "the radius reached scales approximately as @xmath4 .",
    "the exact radius reached is likely to depend on the detailed velocity and density structure within the cluster , but it does indicate that only high - luminosity agn will be able to directly heat gas at 100 kpc or more from the cluster centre . *",
    "how an agn delivers its energy determines where that energy ends up in the cluster .",
    "lower luminosity agn that are active for long periods are more efficient at heating the inner few 10 s of kpc , while high luminosity agn are necessary to deliver energy to large radii . in our simulations , an agn with a luminosity of @xmath28  erg / s that was active for 90 myr was as effective at removing mass and increasing entropy in the inner 30 kpc of the cluster as a @xmath65  erg / s agn active for 30 myr , despite emitting only 30% as much total power .",
    "however , the effects of the @xmath28  erg / s agn were limited to half the radius of the @xmath65  erg / s agn . * in a hydrostatic cluster , agn evolution is quite different .",
    "a long - duration agn inflates two large bubbles rather than many smaller ones .",
    "jet material remains concentrated near the jet axis and the radius reached by the jet material continues to increase with time beyond the value we find in the dynamic case .",
    "the relationship between jet power and the radius of the jets `` sphere of influence '' has consequences for the impact jets have on clusters .",
    "the strong effect that the motion of cluster gas has on the agn development means that exactly how and where an agn deposits energy will be strongly affected by the inflation history of the jet and the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "low - power agn are more efficient at heating the central cluster , but the heat is confined , implying that an additional heat source may be needed farther from the centre of the cluster .",
    "one possible heat source is conduction of heat from warm gas in the outer cluster to cooling gas toward the centre .",
    "recent work by parrish et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and ruszkowski & oh ( 2010 ) has shown that turbulence can suppress the heat - flux - driven buoyancy instability and allow efficient thermal conduction to occur .",
    "agn activity can act as a source of turbulence , potentially providing a switch that allows conduction to occur when an agn is active .",
    "heinz et al . ( 2010 ) , using some of the same simulations presented here , found an increase in the turbulent velocity dispersion of cluster gas due to agn activity of up to several @xmath66  km  s@xmath67 .",
    "central heating in cooling flows ( where the entropy has to be injected in a relatively small volume ) is more likely to result from continuously operating lower power jet than episodic powerful outbursts .",
    "this is , in a sense , numerical confirmation of the effervescent model , where continuous low - level activity generated multiple generations of bubbles ( ruszkowski & begelman 2002 ) .",
    "however , in our case , the effect of cluster weather is primarily responsible for breaking off bubbles , not necessarily the bubble s buoyant escape .",
    "the initial structure of a cluster will play a large role in determining the specific morphology of an agn outflow .",
    "although we only use one realistic cluster setup for our simulations , it is clear that the assumption of a simple one - to - one correspondence between observations of x - ray cavities or waves and periods of activity from an intermittent agn is not valid .",
    "multiple bubbles could be formed by intermittent agn activity , but it is possible to produce multiple generations of x - ray bubbles from a single , continuously active agn .",
    "the simulations presented here do not include magnetic fields .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields could stabilize the bubbles created by the agn , allowing them to rise farther away from the cluster centre before becoming disrupted ( ruszkowski et al .",
    "observations of an increase in x - ray cavity size with distance from the cluster centre have been interpreted as favoring a current - dominated mhd jet model ( diehl et al .",
    ". however , brggen et al . (",
    "2009 ) argued that pure hydro simulations could produce similar observations .",
    "even if the bubble evolution is not dominated by magnetic fields , the presence of weak magnetic fields will affect the mixing of jet and cluster material and can change where energy is deposited .",
    "future simulations including realistic magnetic fields will assess the effect of magnetic fields on cluster evolution .",
