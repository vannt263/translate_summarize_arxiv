    "there have been also theoretical developments in the context of aging .",

    ", it is shown that the autoresponse function of the class is well described by the logarithmic ( log ) and logarithmic squared ( log@xmath15 ) extensions of the scaling function with local scale invariance for @xmath11 .    in a recent paper @xcite based on @xcite@xcite ,",
    "we have considered log extensions of the two - time correlation and response functions of the scalar operators with the conformal schrdinger and aging symmetries for the spatial dimension @xmath16 and the dynamical exponent @xmath17 , in the context of gauge / gravity duality @xcite@xcite .",
    "the power - law and log parts are determined by the scaling dimensions of the dual field theory operators , the eigenvalue of the internal coordinate and the aging parameter , which are explained below .",
    "interestingly , our two - time response functions show several qualitatively different behaviors : growth , aging ( power - law decaying ) or both behaviors for the entire range of our scaling time , depending on the parameters in our theory @xcite .",
    "we further have made connections to the phenomenological field theory model @xcite in detail .",

    "the natural candidates for the bulk fields , in the holographic dual descriptions of lcft , of the pair of two primary operators forming jordan cell are given by a pair of fields with the same spin and a special coupling .",

    "recently , higher derivative gravity models on ads geometry with dual lcft have got much attention , starting in three dimensional gravity models @xcite-@xcite . in four and higher dimensional ads geometry ,",
    "the gravity models with curvature - squared terms typically contain massless and ghostlike massive spin two fields . when the couplings of the curvature - squared terms are tuned , the massless and massive modes become degenerate and turn into the massless and logarithmic modes @xcite .",

    "this can be explicitly checked in the figure [ fig : negativenus ] .",
    "the early time power scaling behaviors are governed by the scaling dimensions of the dual field theory operators .",
    "in particular , their growth and aging is determined by the sign of the parameter @xmath274 .",
    "the late time behaviors are modified by @xmath276 , the aging parameter . if @xmath286 , the initial behaviors persist without change , which is expected due to its time translation invariance . the turning point between these two time regions",

    "we make some contacts with kim - kosterlitz model @xcite at higher spatial dimensions with an assumptions ( [ azrelationkpz ] ) for some particular dual scalar operators .",
    "although it is not perfect , we consider this as a promising sign for the future developments along the line .",
    "we mention two pressing questions we would like to answer in a near future .",
    "our holographic model is an infinite system , and thus obtaining the roughness exponent `` @xmath322 '' is rather challenging . progresses on this point will provide a big step toward realizing holographic kpz class .",
    "assumption ( [ azrelationkpz ] ) is well understood in the field theoretical models @xcite .",
    "there galilean invariance was a crucial ingredient , which is also important in our holographic model . verifying this relation would be an important future challenge",
