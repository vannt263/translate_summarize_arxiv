    "the very existence of black holes of masses @xmath4 or more in quasars at cosmic redshift @xmath5 @xcite has greatly challenged the theory for the growth of supermassive black holes .",
    "recently , a @xmath6 black hole has also been identified in a quasar at redshift @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the most natural way for the growth of black holes is accretion of gases .",
    "however , as discussed below , it is very unlikely that a black hole can grow to a mass of @xmath4 by redshift @xmath3 by accretion from a standard geometrically thin accretion disk .",
    "an astronomical black hole has two independent parameters , its mass @xmath8 and angular momentum @xmath9 .",
    "a dimensionless spin parameter is defined by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the newtonian gravitational constant , and @xmath12 is the speed of light . according to general relativity",
    ", @xmath13 must have a amplitude smaller than or equal to unity , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "a geometrically thin disk is very efficient in converting mass into radiation and spinning up a black hole .",
    "when the effect of photon recapture by the black hole is included , the maximum spin that a black hole can acquire by accretion from a thin accretion disk is @xmath15 ( the `` canonical '' spin , thorne 1974 ) , corresponding to a disk efficiency @xmath16 ( the efficiency in converting rest mass into radiated energy ; see also li et al . 2005 ) .",
    "when a black hole is spun up from the non - rotating state ( @xmath17 ) to the canonical state ( @xmath18 ) , its mass grows by a factor of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , if a supermassive black hole had been growing by accretion from a thin disk , we would expect that its spin had already been equal to the canonical value from the very early stage , so that during the majority part of the history of the black hole growth the disk efficiency should be close to @xmath20 .",
    "with such a high disk efficiency , for a black hole to grow to a mass of @xmath4 by the redshift @xmath21 through accretion from a thin disk , its initial mass should be @xmath22 ( see sec .",
    "[ eqs ] ) .",
    "this is almost impossible since among the seed black holes that have been proposed , the less exotic ones are in the range of @xmath23 ",
    "@xmath24 @xcite .    for a black hole to grow from a reasonable seed mass to a mass of @xmath25 by @xmath21 through accretion , the disk efficiency has to be very low . although accretion modes with low efficiency exist ( e.g. , accretion through a geometrically thick disk ) , observations have provided stringent constraint on the average accretion efficiency .",
    "@xcite has proposed a simple approach to constrain the disk accretion efficiency in quasars : dividing the observed integrated luminosity density of quasars by the observed local black hole mass density .",
    "based on this approach , @xcite found that the average disk accretion efficiency for black holes in quasars must be @xmath0 , otherwise the accreted mass density of the black holes during quasar phases would exceed the local mass density of black holes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this constraint indicates that the geometrically thin disk accretion phase must have occupied a significant fraction of time during the cosmic black hole accretion history .",
    "recently , disks misaligned with the black hole spin have been revisited by @xcite .",
    "a major discovery is that when the disk angular momentum is less than twice of the black hole spin and the angle between them satisfies certain condition the alignment torque between the black hole and the disk will counter - align the disk to the black hole spin .",
    "then , it is possible that under some favorable conditions accretion is composed of a series of episodes with the disk angular momentum randomly orientated relative to the black hole spin so that spinning - up and spinning - down of the black hole have about equal possibilities .",
    "for example , @xcite have proposed that if the disk is self - gravitating , it may repeatedly collapse producing accretion with a series of random orientations and thus the accretion will result in counter - alignment roughly half of time .",
    "then , if the repeating process happens very frequently , the spin parameter of the black hole will fluctuate around a mean value near zero , indicating a lower efficiency in converting accretion mass into radiated energy than a maximally spinning black hole . for recent review and discussion on misaligned disks and their effects on evolution of the black hole spin ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite argued that within the cosmological framework , where the most massive black holes have grown in mass via merger - driven accretion , one expects that disk accretion tends to make most supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies to have on average higher spins than black holes in spiral galaxies .",
    "they proposed that the evolution of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies are dominated by long and continuous accretion episodes arisen from major mergers so their spins are brought up to very high values . while in spiral galaxies , growth of black holes are probably dominated by random and small accretion episodes ( e.g. , tidally disrupted stars , accretion of molecular clouds ) and hence the black holes on average have low value spins .",
    "they also argued that their models are in agreement with by the discovery that disk galaxies tend to be weaker radio sources than elliptical galaxies @xcite .    even though it is possible that the black hole may not get a large net spin through random accretion , it is still unlikely that accretion through geometrically thin disks is efficient enough to grow the mass of the black hole to @xmath26 by @xmath21 .",
    "as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ eqs ] , for a geometrically thin disk around a non - spinning black hole with a luminosity @xmath20 times the eddington luminosity , to have the black hole mass @xmath27 by @xmath21 the initial mass of the seed black hole must be at least @xmath28 .",
    "growth of supermassive black holes by mergers has also been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , the black hole growth via merging is not expected to be very effective , especially when the recoil speed caused by the emission of gravitational wave is large @xcite .",
    "growth of black holes by super - eddington accretion has been extensively explored @xcite . in particular , with monte carlo simulation @xcite have investigated a model for the early assembly of supermassive black holes by the merger tree of mini - halos , with a stable super - eddington accretion phase at redshift @xmath29 .",
    "they found that even a short phase of super - eddington accretion eases the requirement by the existence of black holes of masses @xmath30 in quasars at redshift @xmath31 .",
    "recent study on the growth of black holes by accretion and super - eddington accretion includes @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "super - eddington accretion , for which the mass accretion rate exceeds the eddington limit but the luminosity does not , is very effective in feeding a black hole but has a very low radiation efficiency .",
    "hence , people have argued against super - eddington accretion by the observational constraint on the average accretion efficiency @xmath0 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we perform an analytical investigation of the growth of supermassive black holes via joint sub- and super - eddington accretion in the framework of coevolution of black holes , quasars , and galaxies .",
    "this framework , in which quasar activity is assumed to be triggered by mergers of galaxies @xcite , has been motivated by the observations that black hole masses in nearby galaxies correlate with some properties of the host galaxies , such as the bulge luminosities and masses @xcite , and the central velocity dispersion @xcite . however , we point out that the arguments in this paper in favor of super - eddington accretion are valid for any mechanism that drives gases rapidly toward the galactic nucleus and fuel the growth of the black hole .",
    "galaxy mergers are only one of such mechanisms , other mechanisms include , for instance , global disk instabilities @xcite .",
    "we assume that super - eddington accretion takes place during a major merger of galaxies , since a major merger is expected to bring a lot of cold gas to the nucleus of the merged galaxy .",
    "we show that , with super - eddington accretion the mass of a black hole grows very rapidly . within a fraction of @xmath32",
    ", the mass of the black hole can grow to an arbitrary large value , provided that there is enough gas to accrete .",
    "we show that if the feedback effect is taken into account , a super - eddington accretion phase will switch to a sub - eddington phase when the mass of the black hole becomes large enough ( @xmath33 ) , then a black hole of mass @xmath4 can easily be produced by @xmath21 .",
    "we argue that , since the super - eddington phase can only take place in favorable conditions ( e.g. , during a major merger of galaxies ) , it can at most occupy a short period of time during the history of a supermassive black hole .",
    "then , the accretion efficiency averaged over the whole accretion history can easily reach a value @xmath0 , consistent with the observational constraint .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ super ] , we present the solution for super - eddington accretion , and show that super - eddington is very efficient for growing the black hole . in sec .",
    "[ twos ] we propose a two - phase scenario for the growth of supermassive black holes : with an initial super - eddington phase and a later sub - eddington phase , the mass of the black hole grows rapidly and the observational constraint on the average accretion efficiency is not violated . in sec .",

    "[ concl ] we draw our conclusions and briefly discuss the observational test of the existence of super - eddington accretion phase in quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "we assume a flat @xmath34cdm cosmology with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 km s@xmath38 mpc@xmath38 @xcite .",
    "let us express the mass of the black hole , the mass accretion rate , and time in dimensionless parameters @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the initial mass of the black hole , @xmath41 erg s@xmath38 is the eddington luminosity , and @xmath42 is the eddington time .",
    "note , our definition of the eddington time , @xmath43 , differs from the salpeter time by a factor @xmath44 , the efficiency of accretion . when @xmath45 , @xmath43 is ten times of the salpeter time .",
    "although the salpeter time is more often used in the literature , we find that @xmath43 is more convenient , at least for the purpose of the current paper .    then , the evolution of the mass and the spin of the black hole under disk accretion is determined by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the specific energy , @xmath48 is the specific angular momentum of a disk particle at the inner boundary of the disk .",
    "the efficiency of the disk in converting rest mass into energy is @xmath49 .",
    "the luminosity of the disk is @xmath50    in the theory of accretion disks it is usually assumed that the luminosity of the disk is bounded by the eddington luminosity .",
    "the arguments are that if the luminosity of the disk radiation exceeds the eddington luminosity , it is expected that the intense pressure of the disk radiation will halt the accretion flow so that steady accretion with luminosity greater than the eddington luminosity is impossible @xcite .",
    "so , we assume that the luminosity is bounded by the eddington luminosity , i.e. , @xmath51 is defined by eq .",
    "[ xi_cr ] ) , the luminosity of the disk is not cut - off abruptly by the eddington luminosity . instead , above the critical mass accretion rate",
    "the disk luminosity varies logarithmically with the mass accretion rate and about @xmath52 can be approached for very high mass accretion rate @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath53    if the disk is geometrically thin , its particles move on keplerian orbits in the equatorial plane .",
    "then , the inner boundary of the disk is at the marginally stable circular orbit , i.e. , @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the disk efficiency is then @xmath55 .",

    "substituting @xmath61 into the inequality  ( [ xi_con ] ) , we get a limit on the mass accretion rate for thin disk accretion : @xmath62 , where @xmath63 hence , a necessary condition for the disk to be geometrically thin is that @xmath64 ( i.e. , the accretion rate must be sub - eddington ) since then the disk luminosity is below the eddington limit .    when @xmath65 , the disk has a super - eddington accretion rate , and the inner region of the disk must be geometrically thick due to the trap of radiation @xcite . in this case",
    ", the inner boundary of the disk is located at a place between the marginally stable orbit and the marginally bound orbit ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) , and its efficiency is smaller than @xmath67 so that the luminosity does not exceed the eddington limit @xcite .    even for a geometrically thick accretion disk , the specific energy and the specific angular momentum of disk particles",
    "are still approximately equal to the keplerian values at the inner boundary of the disk since where the gas and radiation pressure is always negligible , although this is not the case for particles on orbits of larger radii .",
    "thus , we always set @xmath47 and @xmath48 to their keplerian values as though particles on the inner boundary move on a keplerian circular orbit .",
    "the specific energy @xmath68 for particles on keplerian circular orbit in the equatorial plane of a kerr black hole minimizes at the marginally stable orbit @xmath69 , and @xmath70 at the marginally bound orbit @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath44 maximizes when the disk inner boundary is at the marginally stable orbit , and @xmath72 at the marginally bound orbit ( fig .",
    "[ eff ] ) .",
    "for an efficiency between zero and the maximum value @xmath67 , the inner boundary of the disk is at a radius between @xmath60 and @xmath73 . for comparison , in fig .",
    "[ eff ] we also show the efficiency of a newtonian disk , which monotonically increases as the radius of the disk inner boundary decreases .    for super - eddington accretion ( @xmath65 ) , the luminosity is @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the disk efficiency is @xmath75 . in the case of extreme super - eddington accretion with @xmath76 , the efficiency @xmath77",
    "so we must have @xmath78 .",
    "in study of the growth of supermassive black holes , people often assume that the disk is geometrically thin ( so its inner boundary is at the marginally stable orbit ) , and the ratio of the disk luminosity to the eddington luminosity is a constant number smaller than but close to unity .",
    "that is , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . in this case ,",
    "equation  ( [ dmdt ] ) becomes @xmath81    when @xmath82 , the solution to equation  ( [ dmdt0 ] ) is @xmath83 \\ ; , \\label{m_sol0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath84 at @xmath85 . under thin disk accretion",
    "the spin of the black hole will quickly grow to the canonical value @xmath58 and then is saturated at that vale , when the effect of photon recapture is considered @xcite . for a black hole to spin up from a non - rotating state to the canonical state , the mass of the black hole need only increase by a factor of about @xmath86 .",
    "hence , the most natural value for a constant @xmath67 is the efficiency when the black hole is in the canonical state , which is @xmath87 .",
    "then , the solution becomes @xmath88 .    at redshift @xmath21",
    ", the age of the universe is about @xmath89 gyr , and @xmath90 .",
    "thus , since @xmath91 , at @xmath21 we should have @xmath92 . to explain the existence of a black hole of mass @xmath27 at @xmath21 @xcite by thin disk accretion , the mass of the seed black hole would have to be @xmath93 .",
    "this is almost impossible since among the seed black holes that have been proposed the less exotic ones are in the range of @xmath94 @xcite .    for a geometrically thin disk to be a good approximation",
    ", the disk luminosity should not exceed 0.3 times the eddington luminosity @xcite .",
    "take @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( the efficiency for a non - spinning black hole ) , we get @xmath97",
    ". then , to explain the existence of a black hole of mass @xmath27 at @xmath21 by the growth of black holes via the model of a thin disk around an always - non - spinning black hole , the mass of the seed black hole would have to be @xmath98 .",
    "this would also require a quite exotic high - mass seed black hole .",
    "the assumption @xmath99 in the standard treatment may not be correct in reality .",
    "in fact , the mass accretion rate is determined by the boundary condition of the accretion flow .",
    "a widely adopted formula for estimation of the mass accretion rate is given by the bondi rate @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are , respectively , the mass density and the sound speed at infinity , and @xmath103 is a number depending on the state equation of the gas .",
    "the bondi rate was derived from a steady and spherical accretion flow . for the case of disk accretion",
    ", the accretion flow can not be spherically symmetric and steady even at a distance far from the central black hole .",
    "@xcite have shown that the disk accretion flow is highly nonsymmetric and the accretion rate is highly time variable for a given set of conditions in the galaxy at @xmath104 kpc .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that when the gas is in a state of free - fall at the evaluation radius due to efficient cooling and the dominant gravity of the surrounding halo , the bondi model can not give correct estimation of the accretion rate .",
    "they have proposed an expression for the sub - grid accretion rate which interpolates between the free - fall regime and the bondi regime by taking into account the contribution of the halo to the gas dynamics .    if @xmath101 and @xmath102 are constants in time , by the bondi formula we have @xmath105 . since @xmath106 , by the definition of @xmath107 we have @xmath108 .",
    "the formula proposed by @xcite takes into account the gravity of the halo , which results a mass accretion rate that varies with @xmath8 slower than that given by the bondi rate .",
    "therefore , to make the results more general , we assume that @xmath109 where @xmath110 , and @xmath111 is the value of @xmath107 at the beginning of accretion ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the limit of @xmath112 corresponds to the bondi model .",
    "the limit of @xmath113 corresponds to the case that the black hole accretes at a rate given by the eddington rate multiplied by a constant number , which corresponds to a constant ratio of the disk luminosity to the eddington luminosity when the disk efficiency @xmath44 remains a constant .",
    "a value of @xmath114 between 0 and 1 may represent a more realistic case , for instance the model of @xcite .",
    "suppose the black hole is always spun up by accretion , i.e. , @xmath115 does not decrease with time .",
    "then , @xmath67 does not decrease with time .",
    "if at the beginning the accretion is super - eddington ( i.e. , @xmath116 ) , it will remain super - eddington as accretion goes on as long as @xmath117 , until some feedback effect becomes important to reduce the accretion rate , or the fuel is finally exhausted . even if at the beginning the accretion is sub - eddington ( i.e. , @xmath118 ) it will eventually becomes super - eddington if @xmath119 provided that the accretion takes place for a sufficiently long time .",
    "it is under debate how much a fraction of the total inflowing gas is expelled into an outflow when the total mass accretion rate is super - eddington @xcite .",
    "the concept of eddington luminosity was derived by the consideration that when the luminosity exceeds the eddington limit the intense pressure of the radiation on the ionized gas would overcome the gravity of the central object onto which the gas accreted so that the accretion would be halted until the luminosity got below the eddington limit . however , since @xmath120 , the reduce in the luminosity does not necessarily requires the reduce in the mass accretion rate , it can also be realized by reducing the accretion efficiency @xmath44 .    even for spherical accretion , it was found that an intense outflow may not be produced when the accretion rate exceeds the eddington limit @xcite . as the accreting gas falls deep enough in the gravitational well of the central black hole so that the eddington luminosity is approached , a `` trapping radius '' of radiation",
    "is crossed within which the radiation is trapped in the gas and dragged into the black hole by the inflowing gas .",
    "effectively , the accretion efficiency is reduced while the mass accretion rate is not .",
    "( for recent discussion on photon trapping , see wyithe & loeb 2011 . )",
    "the situation is similar for the case of accretion disks @xcite .",
    "when the mass accretion rate exceeds the eddington limit , a `` trapping radius '' is also formed in the inner region of the disk . within the trapping radius",
    "the disk radiation is trapped in the gas and dragged into the central black hole by the accreting gas , the effective accretion efficiency is hence reduced .",
    "in addition to this , general relativity also provides a new possibility for reducing the disk efficiency . because of general relativity , the gravitational binding energy decreases as the inner boundary of the disk moves inward inside the marginally stable orbit , so that the disk efficiency is decreased ( fig .",
    "[ eff ] ) .",
    "as the inner boundary approaches the marginally bound orbit , the disk efficiency approaches zero .",
    "thus , to prevent the growth of the disk luminosity , it is not necessary to reduce the mass accretion rate since it can be realized by the photon trapping effect and/or the general relativistic effect .    the ability of preventing the disk luminosity from exceeding the eddington luminosity by lowering the radiative efficiency without need of reducing the mass rate accreting onto the central black hole leads to the possibility that in the black hole case a highly super - eddington accretion may not necessarily lead to to a large outflow of mass .",
    "therefore , in this paper we ignore the effect of outflows for super - eddington accretion , in which case the inner boundary of the disk will move inward toward the marginally bound orbit to reduce the disk efficiency so that the luminosity does not exceeds the eddington luminosity .",
    "substituting equation  ( [ xi1 ] ) into equations  ( [ dmdt ] ) and ( [ dadt ] ) , we obtain @xmath121",
    "under sub - eddington accretion , the disk is geometrically thin and the inner boundary is fixed at the marginally stable orbit : @xmath122",

    "this is somewhat smaller than the value when the effect of photon recapture is considered , the latter is about @xmath86 @xcite .",

    "the accretion then transits from the super - eddington phase to the sub - eddington phase , the growth of the black hole is slowed down , and finally stops when the fuel is exhausted .",
    "the feedback process produced by the intense disk radiation becomes important when @xcite @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the velocity dispersion of the halo hosting the galaxy , @xmath187 denotes the fraction of the black hole radiation converted to the kinetic energy of the gas .",
    "while in models where the outflowing gas can efficiently cool such that the flow is dominated by momentum , a different relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath186 was obtained @xcite @xmath188 this relation is remarkably close to the observed @xmath189 relation @xcite . no matter which feedback model is more precise",
    ", the important point is that when the mass of the black hole becomes greater than a few @xmath190 the feedback process comes in to halt accretion .",
    "although super - eddington accretion is very efficient in growing the black hole mass , it has a very low efficiency in converting mass into radiation .",

    "[ epsilon_av ] below ) @xmath193 by equation ( [ dmdt3 ] ) , in the limit @xmath76 we get @xmath194 which is @xmath192 .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that the observational constraint @xmath195 is violated .",
    "this is because of the following fact : super - eddington accretion can only happen under very favorable conditions , in an environment with a lot of cold gas around the central black hole , which could happen , e.g. , during a major merger of galaxies .",
    "hence , accretion in super - eddington phase can at most occupy a short transient period ( up to a fraction of the eddington time ) in the whole evolution history of a supermassive black hole .",
    "the rest of the history would be dominated by sub - eddington accretion , which has a high efficiency in converting mass into energy .",
    "gyr , a black hole of @xmath196 starts sub - eddington accretion ( a ; @xmath197 ) . at @xmath198 gyr ,",
    "the black hole enters a phase of super - eddington accretion ( b ; triggered by , e.g. , a major merger of galaxies ) , within a short period of time ( @xmath199 ) its mass grows to @xmath200 .",
    "then , the super - eddington accretion ends ( caused by the feedback effect , presumably ) , and the accretion becomes sub - eddington again ( c ) .",

    "the black hole grew slowly by accreting mass from the surrounding gas .",
    "after a long period of this primary sub - eddington accretion stage , the mass of the black increased to @xmath205 before the surrounding environment of the black hole was changed suddenly caused by a major merger of galaxies .",
    "the merger supplied a large amount of cold gas to the neighbor of the central black hole , and the black hole entered a phase of super - eddington accretion .",
    "the mass of the black hole then grew very rapidly , until it was large enough that the feedback process took place to decrease the mass accretion rate and slow down the growth of the black hole .",
    "the black hole then entered again a phase of sub - eddington accretion .",
    "the super - eddington phase took a very short period of time ( e.g. , @xmath206 if at the beginning of the super - eddington accretion we have @xmath207 ) , but during which the mass of the black hole could inflate by a factor @xmath208 .",
    "after the super - eddington phase ended , the black hole continued growing slowly by sub - eddington accretion .",
    "after a somewhat long time ( e.g. , several to ten eddington time ) , the mass of the black hole increased by a factor @xmath209 , which is of order @xmath210 .",
    "although this second phase of sub - eddington accretion is not very efficient for growing the mass of the black hole , it is crucial for boosting the average efficiency in converting mass into radiation .    for the whole accretion process",
    ", the average efficiency in converting mass into energy is calculated by @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the luminosity of the disk .    for the super - eddington accretion phase which boosts the mass of the black hole from @xmath84 to @xmath213 , by equation ( [ dmdt3a ] )",
