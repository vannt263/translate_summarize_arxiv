    ". the rarity of liners in the 1jy ulirg and sw01 samples may be at least partly due to selection effects .",
    "nearly all of the previously classified ir - luminous liners are starburst / agn composite galaxies in the ke06 classification scheme",
    "the new classification scheme reveals a clear evolutionary scenario for ulirgs from starburst - driven activity in the early merger stages , composite starburst - agn activity intermediate merger stages to agn - dominated emission at late merger stages .",

    "this stage corresponds to the highest @xmath0 in the 1jy ulirg sample . at this stage",
    ", we propose that  ( a ) starburst activity subsides , allowing the agn to dominate the energy budget , and/or   ( b ) dust obscuration surrounding the agn clears , allowing the agn radiation field to ionize the surrounding gas , and/or ( c ) agn activity increases .",

    "theoretical models have shown that the distribution of galaxies on the bpt diagrams are mainly driven by variations of parameters such as metallicity , stellar age , ism pressure and ionization parameter @xcite .",
    "the different sensitivity to these parameters of the four line ratios makes the three bpt diagrams distinct in distinguishing certain branches of galaxies .",
    "@xcite defined @xmath52 on the [ oi]/h@xmath30 diagram because the seyfert and liner branches are most clearly separated on the [ oi]/h@xmath30 diagram . in this case , @xmath52 can be defined separately for seyferts and liners .",
    "the disadvantage of this diagram is that pure star - forming galaxies have to be removed first using the other two diagrams , because star - forming galaxies and starburst - agn composites occupy similar regions on the [ oi]/h@xmath30 diagram .",
    "the advantage of the [ nii]/h@xmath30 diagram is that the star - forming sequence is most tightly formed , giving a better contrast with the starburst - agn branch .",

    "however , in this diagram , seyferts and liners can not be well separated .",
    "we define @xmath52 on the [ nii]/h@xmath30 diagram in fig .",

    "we list the @xmath52 defined on both diagrams in tables  [ tb1]-[tb3 ] .",
    "there is little difference in the two differently defined @xmath52 , however , it is not meaningful to compare the absolute value of @xmath52 . as emphasized in the text ,",

    "in   [ class ] , we use the 2-of-3 criterion to assign a class to our samples , based on agreement between two out of the three standard optical diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the 2-of-3 criterion has two advantages : ( 1 ) the final classification is less sensitive to low signal - to - noise in either [ oi ]  or [ sii ] which may sometimes be weak , and ( 2 ) galaxies without [ sii ]  or [ oi ]  measurements can be assigned a class based on the remaining one or two diagnostic diagrams .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bptamb ] , we show the galaxies in the 3 samples classified using the 2-of-3 criterion on the bpt diagrams .",
    "as outlined in @xcite , the  line ratio is more sensitive to the presence of low - level agn than  or because  is more sensitive to metallicity .",
    "the log ( ) line ratio is a linear function of the nebular metallicity until high metallicities where the log ( ) ratio saturates .",
    "this saturation point causes the star - forming sequence to be almost vertical at log@xmath106@xmath107 .",
    "any agn contribution moves  above this saturation level , allowing the identification of galaxies with even small agn contributions .",
    "the  and  line ratios can not be used to distinguish composite galaxies from pure star - forming galaxies . in the  and  diagnostic diagrams ,",
    "composite galaxies occupy a region that is degenerate with the star - forming galaxy sequence .",
    "this problem is caused by the relationship between  and  and metallicity .",
    "the agn - starburst mixing sequence begins at the high metallicity end of the star - forming galaxy sequence .",
    "the  and  line ratios ( unlike the  ratio ) are double - valued with metallicity over the range of observed  and  ratios in nearby galaxies .",
    "the highest metallicity star - forming galaxies occur at low  and  ratios ( log@xmath106@xmath108 to @xmath109 , and log@xmath106@xmath110 to @xmath111 ) ( see figures in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , a large agn contribution ( @xmath112% ) is required for a composite galaxy to rise above the star - forming galaxy sequence .",
    "the 3-of-3 criterion is a more stringent method of classification that is based on all three diagnostic diagrams .",
    "this method allows ambiguous galaxies to be classified as those galaxies that have one classification in one or two diagrams and a different classification in the remaining diagram(s ) .",
    "the 3-of-3 criterion is suitable for galaxies with high s / n spectra where all five diagnostic emission - lines have @xmath113 ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "<S> , we find that the fraction of liners in ir - selected samples is rare ( @xmath2% ) compared with other spectral types . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of strong infrared emission in liners is consistent with recent optical studies suggesting that liners contain agn with lower accretion rates than in seyfert galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> most previously classified infrared - luminous liners are classified as starburst - agn composite galaxies in the new scheme . </S>",
    "<S> starburst - agn composites appear to  bridge \" the spectral evolution from starburst to agn in ulirgs . </S>",
    "<S> the relative strength of the agn versus starburst activity shows a significant increase at high infrared luminosity . in ulirgs ( @xmath3 ) , </S>",

    "<S> our results are consistent with models for ir - luminous galaxies where mergers of gas - rich spirals fuel both starburst and agn , and where the agn becomes increasingly dominant during the final merger stages of the most luminous infrared objects . </S>"
