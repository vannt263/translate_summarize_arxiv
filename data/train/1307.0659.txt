    "the new x - ray transient ( xrt ) swiftj1357.20933  with galactic coordinates @xmath6=328.702  and @xmath7=+50.004  was detected on 2011 january 28 by the _",

    "@xcite reported the detection of the optical counterpart using the _ gamma - ray burst optical / near - infrared detector _",
    "( grond ) taken on 2011 february 1 .",
    "the images revealed the presence of a star with @xmath8=16.30 inside the x - ray error circle .",
    "a pre - outburst counterpart was detected in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) images with @xmath9mag , and very red colour , which suggested that the companion star was likely a m4 star and lead to a distance estimate of @xmath01.5kpc .",
    "this strongly suggested that swiftj1357.20933  was a short period dwarf nova or low - mass x - ray binary @xcite .",
    "the former scenario can be ruled out though because the _ swift _ x - ray spectrum is consistent with a pure power ",
    "law without a thermal component @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported low resolution optical spectroscopy of the counterpart obtained early in 2011 february which showed a featureless spectrum without any sign of balmer , heii4686 or bowen emission lines , typical of other xrts in outburst .",
    "however , spectroscopy taken a day later did detect a weak h@xmath10 emission line with @xmath11  and @xmath124000@xmath13@xcite and was confirmed by @xcite through high resolution spectroscopy which showed a weak double - peaked extremely broad h@xmath10 profile with velocities characteristic of black - hole x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) . from further optical spectroscopy , the motions of the h@xmath10 emission line wings and the double - peak separation revealed a 2.8h orbital period and a mass function @xmath13.0@xmath4 , implying that the compact object in swiftj1357.20933  is indeed a black hole @xcite .",
    "optical light curves taken during decline from outburst showed unusual , profound dip features that obscure up to 50 per cent of the flux , and have a recurrence frequency which decreases during the outburst decline @xcite .",
    "unexpectedly these optical dips were not present in the x - ray light curves which , combined with the low observed x - ray luminosity @xcite implies that the compact object is hidden from the observer by the accretion disc as expected for a relatively high inclination ( @xmath180 ) accretion disc corona source .    the x - ray outburst was detected for @xmath07 months @xcite and by 2011 august the source was in x - ray quiescence . here",
    "we report on our high - time resolution multi - colour optical observations of swiftj1357.20933  taken during quiescence .",
    "we report on the timing properties of the light curves in quiescence , the short - term variability and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in quiescence and near the peak of the outburst .",
    "multi - colour photometric observations of swiftj1357.20933  were obtained with ultracam  on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope atop la palma during the nights of ut 2012 april 24 and 25 .",
    "ultracam  is an ultra - fast , triple - beam ccd camera , where the light is split into three broad - band colours ( blue , green and red ) by two dichroics .",
    "the detectors are back - illuminated , thinned , e2v frame - transfer 1024@xmath141024 ccds with a pixel scale of 0.3arcsec / pixel . due to the architecture of the ccds",
    "the dead - time is essentially zero ( for further details see @xcite ) .",
    "on ut 2012 april 24 observations ( ut 23:1303:26 ) were taken using the sloan @xmath15- , @xmath16- and @xmath8-band filters , whereas on the 2012 april 25 observations ( ut 21:5803:46 ) were taken using the sloan @xmath15- , @xmath16- and @xmath17-band filters .",
    "an exposure time of 10s was used for the @xmath16- , @xmath8- and @xmath17-bands , however , given the faintness of the target an exposure time of 20s was used in the @xmath15-band .",
    "the conditions were generally good but the median seeing was 1.2 and 1.4  on 2012 april 24 and 25 respectively .",
    "the ultracam  pipeline reduction procedures were used to debias and flatfield the data .",
    "the same pipeline was also used to obtain light curves for swiftj1357.20933  and several comparison stars by extracting the counts using aperture photometry .",
    "the most reliable results were obtained using a variable aperture which scaled with the seeing .",
    "the count ratio of the target with respect to a bright local standard ( which has similar colour to our target ) was then determined .",
    "the magnitude of swiftj1357.20933  was then obtained using the calibrated sdss star ( j135716.43 - 093140.1 ) in the field . as a check of the photometry and systematics in the reduction procedure",
    ", we also extracted light curves of a faint comparison star similar in brightness to the target .",
    "the mean observed magnitudes of swiftj1357.20933  are given in table[log ] .",
    "the quality of the @xmath15-band data is a factor of 3 worse than the other data , which is not surprising given its extreme faintness .",
    "therefore in the analysis that follows we only use the @xmath16 , @xmath8 and @xmath17-band data , ( 0.1 per cent accuracy ) where we can be certain that any variability is real .",

    "therefore , one expects that the line velocity reflects the motion of the compact object .",
    "however , the complex and variable shape of the h@xmath10 line profile makes it difficult to measure a velocity that reliably traces the motion of the compact object .",
    "determining radial velocities using double - gaussian fits to the wings of the line profile which trace the motions of the compact object @xcite should in principle give a systemic velocity ( @xmath29 ) the same as that measured from the secondary star s radial velocity curve .    as outlined in @xcite observations of groj0422 + 32 and a062000",

    "therefore for swiftj1357.20933 , the @xmath29 velocity of 150@xmath13  determined from the wings of the h@xmath10 emission line using double - gaussian fitting during outburst @xcite , most likely does not represent the systemic velocity of the binary .",
    "however , this can only be confirmed by determining the systemic velocity of the binary via a radial velocity study of the secondary star .",
    "[ fig : bh_hist ] shows the current histogram of the orbital periods of black hole transients .",
    "in addition to the dynamical black holes the figure also includes the recently discovered short period black hole transients swiftj1753.50127 @xcite , maxij1659152 @xcite and swiftj1357.20933  @xcite .",
    "the distribution has clusterings at 8 and 50h separated by a gap .",
    "the secular evolution of low - mass x - ray binaries follows two paths , depending on the evolutionary stage of the companion star at the start of the mass transfer . @xcite and @xcite found that there is a bifurcation period between @xmath01d for the initial binary orbital period which separate converging and diverging binaries .",
    "if the orbital period at the beginning of the mass transfer is above the bifurcation period , the evolution of the binary begins when the companion evolves off the main sequence , the mass transfer is driven by the internal evolution of the low - mass ( sub-)giant companion stars and the system will evolve towards large orbital periods . if the orbital period of the system at the onset of the mass transfer is below the bifurcation period , the companion star is relatively unevolved , and the only important mechanism driving mass transfer is systemic angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking and gravitational radiation , which eventually leads to stripped evolved companion stars . for angular momentum loss due to magnetic",
    "braking the secondary star must have a convective envelope @xcite , which implies that the initial mass of the secondary star has to be less than 1.5@xmath4  ( stars above this mass have radiative envelopes ) .",
    "this is the same argument as outlined in @xcite for the evolutionary state of maxij1659152 .",
    "thus swiftj1357.20933  starts out with a secondary star less than 1.5@xmath4  and the evolution of the binary drives the system to shorter orbital periods . @xcite and",
    "@xcite compute the evolutionary history of such types of evolution .",
    "sequence a55 in @xcite , but also see sequence 1 in @xcite , starts out with a 1.5@xmath4  secondary star mass and a 4@xmath4  black hole accretor , which is then evolved to an orbital period of 2.4hr , where the secondary star mass is 0.17@xmath4 , with a central h content of 0.09 , a low mass transfer rate @xmath32@xmath4/yr   and an age of 5.7@xmath33yr .",
    "the secondary stars in swiftj1357.20933   as well as maxij1659152 @xcite and xtej1118 + 480 @xcite are nuclearly evolved stars that have undergone considerable evolution .",
    "@xcite determine the velocity dispersion of black hole x - ray binaries by studying their scale - height distribution and obtain a dispersion of @xmath040@xmath13 .",
    "since the velocity dispersion of black hole progenitors is @xmath020@xmath13 , they estimate an extra velocity of @xmath02040@xmath13  is acquired during the formation of the black hole .",
    "this can be in the form of substantial mass - loss in the formation of the black hole or an asymmetric natal kick .",
    "therefore any kicks received by the black hole affect the binary and its subsequent orbit within the galaxy .",
    "there is evidence for asymmetric natal kicks in the formation of neutron stars ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "proper motion studies of pulsars show that neutron stars receive natal kicks at birth in the range @xmath0200400@xmath13  when they are formed during the core - collapse supernova @xcite .",
    "mechanisms that operate during the core - collapse that lead to the formation of a neutron star are large - scale density asymmetries in the pre - supernova core @xcite or asymmetric instabilites in the rapidly rotating proto - neutron star core @xcite .",
    "these can in principle operate at the time of the black hole formation , in particular if a hot proto - neutron star forms first , later followed by a collapse due to fall - back material .",
    "peculiar velocities as large as a few 100@xmath13  are expected for formation of black holes .",
    "indeed , for the first runway black hole groj165550 there is evidence of a runaway space velocity of 112@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "futhermore @xcite point out that the radial velocity of the binary is comparable to a single neutron star having recieved a natal kick in the range 300700@xmath13 .    xtej1118 + 480 is located at a very high lattitude and an elevation of of 1.5kpc above the galactic plane @xcite and has a high space velocity of @xmath0145@xmath13  relative to the local standard of rest , determined from very long baseline array measurements of the system s proper motion @xcite . from evolutionary calculations and detailed hydronamical simulations",
    "@xcite estimate a value of the natal kick in the range 80310@xmath13 .",
    "more recently @xcite have performed population synthesis calculations for the formatioon of black hole in x - ray binaries , including kicks due to the supernova mass - loss and natal kicks due to the formation of the black hole .",
    "they find that large natal kicks are necessary to reach large distances above the galactic .",
    "however , surprising , they find that black holes receive similar velocity natal kicks as neutron stars upon formation .",
    "given the similaries of swiftj1357.20933  with xtej1118 + 480 ( orbital period , spectral type , possible large scale - height ) we expect the evolution of swiftj1357.20933  to be similar ( see section [ evolution ] ) .",
    "such short - period systems with large galactic scale heights , could be runaway micro - quasars that were simply kicked out of the galactic plane into the halo during the violent supernova explosion .",
    "table [ table : bhs ] lists the current group of short period black hole transients together with their main properties .",
    "the systems tend to display weak x - ray outbursts with hard power ",
    "law dominated x - ray spectrum ( @xmath34 ) and high galactic latitudes .",
    "most of the short orbital period black hole transients are located at @xmath35kpc which is substantially larger than the 0.625kpc dispersion of the distribution of black hole transients around the galactic plane @xcite and places them in the halo .",
    "their peak x - ray luminosities are also significantly lower than 0.1@xmath36 , the critical luminosity defining the transition from the low hard state to the soft state in black hole transients ( @xmath36 is the eddington luminosity ) . furthermore ,",
    "the ratio of the x - ray ( 211kev ) to optical @xmath23-band luminosities is anomaly low in xtej1118 + 480 and swiftj1357.20933 ; x - ray binaries typically have ratios @xmath01001000 , except for the accretion disc corona sources , which have ratios @xmath020 ( because the central x - ray source is hidden ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite has shown that the peak x - ray luminosities in eddington units generally increase with orbital period , with no distinction between black holes and neutron star binaries .",
    "they also noted that xtej1118 + 480 deviates from the trend and conclude that short orbital period @xmath374h black hole transients may be radiatively inefficient with @xmath21 far less than 1 per cent @xmath38 .",
    "table [ table : bhs ] seems to support this conclusion which , as a matter of fact , appears to explain why very few short period black holes have been found thus far .",
    "also their high galactic latitudes suggest a possible selection effect since low @xmath21 transients in the galactic plane are more affected by extinction and hence difficult to detect .",
    "the short period tail in the distribution of black hole transients seems to be finally emerging thanks to the increased sensitivity of new x - ray satellites .",
    "we have presented high time - resolution ultracam  optical and notcam infrared observations of the edge - on black hole x - ray transient swiftj1357.20933 , when the source was at its pre - outburst magnitude i.e. in quiescence .",
    "the quiescent light curves of swiftj1357.20933   do not show the secondary star s ellipsoidal modulation and are dominated by variability with an optical and infrared fractional rms of @xmath035 per cent , much larger than what is observed in other systems .",
    "optical flare events with amplitudes of up to @xmath01.5 mag are observed as well as numerous rapid @xmath00.8mag dip events which are similar to the optical dips seen in outburst .",
    "similarly the infrared @xmath2-band light curve shows flare events with amplitudes of up to @xmath01.5 mag .",
    "we find that the quiescent optical to mid - ir sed is dominated by a non - thermal component with a power ",
    "law index of 1.4 , ( the broad - band rms sed has a similar index ) , most likely arising from optically thin synchrotron emission from a jet , since the lack of a peak in the spectral energy distribution rules out advection - dominated models .    using the outburst amplitude ",
    "period relation for x - ray transients we estimate the quiescent magnitude of the secondary star to be in the range @xmath3=22.7 to 25.6 . then using the distance modulus with the expected magnitude of a m4.5v star",
    "we constrain the distance to the range 0.5 to 6.3kpc .",
    "the high galactic latitude of swiftj1357.20933  implies a scale height in the range 0.4 to 4.8kpc above the galactic plane .",
    "this possibly places swiftj1357.20933   in a sub - class of high-@xmath5 short - period black hole x - ray transients in the galactic halo .",
