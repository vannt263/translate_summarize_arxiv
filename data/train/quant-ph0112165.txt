    "we have studied the one - dimensional locally periodic multibarrier potential of finite range for both finite and infinite number @xmath0 of barriers .",
    "we found @xcite that there is a critical dependence of the transmission coefficient , the cross section and the distribution of poles of the @xmath7-matrix @xcite on the ratio @xmath1 of the total interval between the barriers to their total width . under certain conditions",
    "this model was found to contain signatures of chaotic behaviour @xcite , such as rapid spread of wave packets and wigner type spectral characteristics .",
    "we discuss in this work thermodynamic properties @xcite such as the specific heat and the entropy of an ensemble of such systems and show that they also depend critically upon this ratio in addition to their dependence upon the temperature .",
    "we show that when the number of barriers is not large there are no low - lying energy eigenvalues for small values of the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "these values of @xmath1 depend upon the value of the number @xmath0 of barriers in such a manner that the ranges of @xmath1 in which this part of the energy spectrum is missing increase at first with @xmath0 and then decrease as @xmath0 continue to grow until they disappear entirely for large enough @xmath0 . above the upper boundaries of these ranges are the points where the energy spectrum contains eigenvalue distribution over all energies .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs in the work of fendley and tchernyshyov @xcite on one - dimensional phase transitions , where the seriously disordered phase behaves as if it were at very high temperature , where the effect of interactions is relatively small , i.e , as an almost independent particle model .",
    "this apparently accounts , even for neighbouring values of @xmath1 within these ranges , for large changes in the average energy and all the other statistical mechanics properties , such as specific heat and entropy , derived from it .",
    "for example , the corresponding curves of the specific heat , for these neighbouring values of @xmath1 , as functions of the temperature , differ markedly from each other , as will be shown in the following , when plotting these curves in a single figure .",
    "this sensitivity of the specific heat is largest for intermediate values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in which the curves of the specific heats as functions of the temperature differ to the extent that some of them exhibit double peak phase transitions while other curves , for neighbouring values of @xmath1 , resemble the conventional debye curve @xcite which characterizes the solid crystal . for infinite @xmath0 ,",
    "as will be shown , the double peak phase phenomenon is retained even for large values of @xmath1 . also , we find , for all values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , indication of phase transitions in specific heat at small values of the temperature @xmath8 .",
    "we note that for any @xmath1 , which is greater than some value which depends upon @xmath0 , the system behaves for all @xmath0 , except for a spike form at small @xmath8 , in a manner similar to that of the solid crystals in which the constituent atoms are widely separated , and thus , as we have remarked , are characterized by large values of the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "this is seen on the corresponding graphs of the specific heats as functions of the temperature which have the same form as that of debye ( we do not imply here that our system is analogous to a system of lattice vibrations , but only to the behaviour of the result due to the apparent presence of uncorrelated modes ) .    in section 2 we study the properties of a one - dimensional @xmath0 potential barrier system when @xmath0 is a finite number . in section 3",
    "we discuss the limit of @xmath2 ( in the same fixed interval ) . for both cases",
    "we find abrupt and large changes in the values of specific heat and entropy for small values of the temperature @xmath8 .",
    "these large changes suggest the existence of phase transitions .",
    "in particular , for intermediate @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we find double peaks @xcite in the specific heat curves .",
    "double peak phase transitions appear , especially , for infinite @xmath0 in which it remains effective even for large values of @xmath1 .",
    "tanaka et al @xcite have found double peak structures in anti - ferromagnetic materials , corresponding to magnetic phases , where the external magnetic field seems to play a role somewhat analogous to the parameter @xmath1 in our study .",
    "leung and neda @xcite and also kim et al @xcite have found double peaks in the response curves , apparently associated with dynamically induced phase transitions .",
    "ko and asakawa @xcite have also found a double peak structure in their calculations of the phases of a quark - gluon plasma , where one may think of a large number of interactions in a bounded region .",
    "we do not imply that our model contains an analog of their interacting systems , but suggest that some of the mathematical properties may be common .",
    "we consider a finite @xmath0 barrier system where all these barriers have the same height @xmath9 and are locally periodic in the finite interval . this array is assumed to start at the point @xmath10 and ends at @xmath11 , so that the total length of this system is @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the total width of all the @xmath0 barriers ( where @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 is the total sum of all the intervals between neighbouring barriers ( where @xmath16 ) .",
    "thus , since we have @xmath0 potential barriers the width of each one is @xmath17 , and the interval between each two neighbouring ones is @xmath18 . denoting @xmath19 where @xmath1 is a real number we can express @xmath13 and @xmath15 in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath1 as @xcite @xmath21 .",
    "let us first consider the passage of a plane wave through this system , which has the form @xmath22 .",
    "matching boundary conditions at the beginning and end of each barrier , we may construct a solution in terms of the transfer matrices @xcite @xmath23 on the @xmath24th barrier .",
    "after the @xmath25th barrier we obtain , using the terminology in @xcite , the following transfer equation @xcite @xmath26 = p^{(n)}p^{(n-1)}\\ldots p^{(2)}p^{(1 ) } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_1\\\\ b_1 \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a product of three two dimensional matrices @xcite . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the amplitudes of the transmitted and reflected parts respectively of the wave function at the @xmath25th potential barrier .",
    "@xmath30 is the coefficient of the initial wave that approaches the potential barrier system , and @xmath31 is the coefficient of the reflected wave from the first barrier .",
    "eq ( [ e1 ] ) may be written as @xcite @xmath32=\\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } e^{-ik(a+b-\\frac{a}{2n } ) }   & 0 \\\\0&e^{ik(a+b-\\frac{a}{2n } ) } \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } t_{11}&t_{12 } \\\\t_{21}&t_{22}\\end{array } \\right ] \\biggl ( \\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } e^{\\frac{ikb}{n-1}}&0\\\\ 0&e^{-\\frac{ikb}{n-1 } } \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } t_{11}&t_{12 } \\\\t_{21}&t_{22}\\end{array } \\right ] \\biggr ) ^{n-1 } \\cdot \\nonumber   \\\\   & & \\cdot \\left",

    "note that the transfer equation ( [ e2 ] ) is valid for both cases of @xmath35 and @xmath36 except for the two - dimensional matrix in @xmath8 which , for the @xmath35 case , assumes the form @xmath37 and for the @xmath36 case @xmath38 the @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 of eq ( [ e3 ] ) are @xcite @xmath42 and those of eq ( [ e4 ] ) @xcite @xmath43 . in the numerical part of this work we assign @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "note that the two matrices @xmath8 from eqs ( [ e3])-([e4 ] ) do not depent on @xmath25 .",
    "we find , now , the energy spectrum of this system .",
    "we use the @xmath7-matrix and the periodic boundary conditions at the two remotely placed sides of the system .",
    "that is , we assume that the wave function and its derivative at the far right end of the system , say at @xmath46 where @xmath47 is much larger than the size @xmath12 of the system , are equal to the wave function and its derivative at the corresponding far left end of the system at @xmath48 , so we obtain @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "thus , using the last relation and those between the components of the @xmath7 and @xmath51 matrices @xcite , where @xmath51 is given by eq ( [ e2 ] ) , @xmath52 one may write the following dependence of the outgoing waves @xmath53 and @xmath31 upon the ingoing ones @xmath30 and @xmath54 @xmath55=\\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } s_{11}&s_{12 } \\\\ s_{21 } & s_{22 }   \\end{array } \\right]\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_1 \\\\ b_{2n+1 }   \\end{array } \\right ]      = e^{2ikc } \\left",

    "we show , now , that the high energy part ( @xmath58 ) of the spectrum obtained from eq ( [ e6 ] ) depends only on @xmath47 and may be obtained analytically without using numerical methods . for that matter",
    "we note that when the energy @xmath59 becomes very large we have @xmath60 , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( see the inline equations after eq ( [ e4 ] ) ) obtain the values of 2 and 0 respectively . in that case the components @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the two dimensional matrix @xmath8 from eq ( [ e3 ] ) become zero , and the diagonal elements @xmath63 and @xmath64 become @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "thus , the two dimensional matrix @xmath51 from eq ( [ e2 ] ) becomes much simplified and may be calculated analytically as follows ( using @xmath67 for the very high part of the energy spectrum ) @xmath68 \\left",

    "thus we see that the two dimensional matrix @xmath51 becomes the unity matrix in the limit of large energies @xmath59 . substituting the resulting components of @xmath51 ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) in eq ( [ e6 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath72   = ( e^{2ikc}-1)^2=0 \\label{e8}\\ ] ] the last equation is satisfied for all @xmath73 , but since we are restricted here to the high energy part of the energy spectrum we refer only to the large values of @xmath25 .",
    "as remarked , the previous equations may be applied also for the @xmath74 case except for the correct @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the energy spectrum is composed of three parts : 1 ) the part for the @xmath74 case .",
    "2 ) the part that satisfies @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is some arbitrarily specified large energy ( these two parts are obtained numerically by solving eq ( [ e6 ] ) for both cases of @xmath35 and @xmath74 case with the appropriate @xmath51 ) , and 3 ) all the high energies that are larger than @xmath76 and are obtained analytically using eqs ( [ e7 ] ) , ( [ e8 ] ) and the relation @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is some specified large integer that corresponds to the energy @xmath76 .",
    "now , since the relation between the energy @xmath59 and @xmath33 is @xmath79 ( as remarked , we assign @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) , the high part of the energy spectrum is given by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 . for the numerical part of the calculations we assign the following values for the relevant parameters : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the @xmath74 part of the spectrum is @xmath86 .",
    "the second part is @xmath87 , and the third part is @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath78 that corresponds to @xmath76 is @xmath89 .",
    "the assigned values for @xmath47 and @xmath20 yield a ratio of @xmath90 which ensures that the points @xmath91 are far enough from the region of the potential and so we may assume ( see the discussion after eq ( [ e4 ] ) ) that the values of the wave function and its derivative at @xmath92 are equal to these at @xmath48 . these equalities are needed for obtaining eqs ( [ e5])-([e6 ] ) .",
    "thus , the results of the numerical simulations depend upon the ratio @xmath93 and not upon the specific values of @xmath47 and @xmath20 . the somewhat higher value of the potential @xmath82 ( the value , conventionally chosen for numerical simulations ( see @xcite ) , is from the range @xmath94 ) is especially chosen for the @xmath74 part of the simulations in order to accumulate enough data and thus to obtain a better statistics .",
    "note that the simulated @xmath75 part , where @xmath85 , yields a large amount of data so that in order not to remain with a comparatively small amount for the @xmath74 part we have chosen , as remarked , a somewhat large value of @xmath9 .",
    "the value of @xmath85 is chosen as a limit value beyond which the corresponding terms of the sums @xmath95 and @xmath96 in the following eq ( [ e9 ] ) may be approximated by their simplified analogs obtained using eq ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "thus , the results are not sensitive to these specific values of @xmath47 , @xmath20 , @xmath9 , and @xmath76 .",
    "we want to obtain a formula for the average energy from which we may derive most of the statistical mechanics parameters mentioned above .",
    "this average energy depends upon @xmath1 , @xmath47 , @xmath0 and the temperature @xmath8 ( the dependence upon the temperature is through @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the boltzman constant which is assigned , in our numerical work , the value of unity ) and is given by @xmath99 where the first sum in the numerator and denominator contains the contributions from all @xmath100 . for higher values of @xmath59",
    "the expressions are simpler and we take this into account in the second sum over all integers @xmath101 . the first sum in the numerator and denominator of",
    "eq ( [ e9 ] ) includes the energies from the @xmath74 and the @xmath102 parts of the spectrum .",
    "these parts are obtained numerically from eq ( [ e6 ] ) in which we substitute for the components of @xmath51 from eq ( [ e2 ] ) , using the @xmath8 s of eq ( [ e3 ] ) for the @xmath35 case , and those of eq ( [ e4 ] ) for @xmath74 . from eq ( [ e9 ] )",
    "we obtain an average energy for each specific triplet of values for @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath103 , and from this average energy we may derive the quantities of statistical physics .",
    "we note that the sums over the energies from the range @xmath104 depend upon the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 whereas the sums over the higher energies do not depend upon them ( see eqs ( [ e7 ] ) , ( [ e8 ] ) ) .",
    "the specific heat @xmath105 is obtained as the derivative of the average energy from eq ( [ e9 ] ) with respect to the temperature @xmath8 .",
    "it is found that for large values of the temperature @xmath8 the curves of the specific heats @xmath105 , for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , tend to the constant value @xmath106 .",
    "that is , for these @xmath8 s the curves of @xmath105 become as expected a constant curve as for dulong - petit @xcite .",
    "also , for small @xmath8 s the curves of @xmath105 , for all @xmath1 and @xmath0 , rise rapidly to their maximum values @xmath107 from which they descend either to the asymptotic value of 0.55 for large @xmath8 as noted or to some minimum from which they rise again to a second peak that descends to the value of 0.55 for large @xmath8 .",
    "we note that the @xmath107 s are points at which the derivative appears to be very large and are , therefore , suggestive of the existence of phase transition @xcite .",
    "the values of these @xmath107 , however , as well as the behavior of the specific heat for intermediate values of @xmath8 depend upon @xmath1 and @xmath0 . it has been found that for large @xmath1 the curves of the specific heats , as functions of @xmath8 , are of the debye type @xcite , that is , the rapid approach to maximum @xmath107 for small @xmath8 and the immediate decrease to a constant value as @xmath8 grows . for small @xmath1 , however , the forms of the specific heat @xmath105 for intermediate @xmath8 depart markedely from that of debye , and the range of @xmath8 in which @xmath105 is different depends upon @xmath0 in such a manner that this range increases as @xmath0 grows . for example , when @xmath108 this range is @xmath109 , for @xmath110 it is @xmath111 and for @xmath112 this range increases to @xmath113 .",
    "figure 1 shows 38 curves of the specific heats , for @xmath114 , as functions of the temperature in the range @xmath115 .",
    "each curve is for a different integral value of @xmath1 in the range @xmath116 .",
    "the central and dense part of the figure , where a large part of the curves have the same form , are those graphs that have a large @xmath1 and , therefore , may represent the solid crystals that are characterized by a periodic structure in which neighbouring occupied sites are widely separated . indeed , these curves resemble , except for the sharp peaks , that of debye which represents well the solid crystal . the other curves that differ from the central ones , and that generally have large values for the specific heats at small @xmath8 , are those that have smaller @xmath1 and",
    ", therefore , do not have the behaviour of the specific heat curves of a solid crystal .",
    "these curves may represent some `` soft '' substance @xcite in which the constituent atoms or molecules are closer to one another than in the solid crystal .",
    "these substances have einstein frequencies @xcite smaller than those of the solid crystals by a factor of 10 to 50 @xcite and , therefore , are characterized by higher values of the specific heats .",
    "also , the remarked sharp peaks have a very large value for the derivative and this suggests an existence of phase transitions .",
    "we have , especially , studied the immediate neighbourhood of the region containing rapid variation in specific heat as a function of temperature and the parameter @xmath1 ( i.e , the neighbourhood of a phase transition ) .",
    "we see that there is a very strong and critical dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "this result illustrates the physical mechanism for the formation of such rapid transitions , a resonance - like phenomena controlled by the _ geometry _ of the barrier system .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 2 which shows 15 curves of the specific heat , for @xmath114 , as functions of the temperature @xmath8 and for the following values of @xmath117 .",
    "the central dense part of the figure , which is composed of 9 curves , is drawn for the larger values of @xmath1 whereas the remaining 6 curves are for the smaller @xmath1 s .",
    "note that although the difference in @xmath1 for any two neighbouring curves is only 0.1 nevertheless the upper curves in the figure differ significantly in appearance from each other and from those of the central part .",
    "fendley and tchernyshyov @xcite have discussed one - dimensional phase transitions in systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom per site .",
    "they argue that a singularity of the maximum eigenvalue in the `` transfer matrix '' ( their model considers a set of systems with su(n ) type symmetry ) causes a phase transition .",
    "the @xmath2 limit of @xcite corresponding to an infinite number of degrees of freedom per site is replaced , in our case , by a large ( infinite ) number of barriers in a finite interval .",
    "the transfer matrix that we have introduced connecting neighbouring sites ( barrier - gap structures ) is independent of @xmath103 ( inverse temperature ) , but the eigenvalue of the total transfer matrix of the infinite system has a branch point as we show in section 3 .",
    "this singularity can influence the behaviour of the partition function , resulting , as in @xcite , in the phase transitions that we observe in our numerical study .",
    "figure 3 shows 39 different curves of the specific heat @xmath105 as function of the temperature for @xmath118 .",
    "each curve is for a different integral value of @xmath1 from the range @xmath119 . as in figure 1 one",
    "can see a dense batch of similar curves in the central part of the figure and other 16 curves that are graphed one above the other in the upper part of it .",
    "the dense batch corresponds , as in figure 1 , to the larger values of @xmath1 and so may represent the solid materials that are characterized by a periodic structure ( see the discussion of figure 1 ) .",
    "the other 16 curves correspond to the smaller values of @xmath1 but compared to the former figure ( for @xmath114 ) one can see that these curves demonstrate the double peak appearance found in antiferromagnetic @xcite and superconducting materials @xcite . the first peak may be clearly seen at low temperatures at about @xmath120 and the second higher peak at about @xmath121 .",
    "all the curves of figure 3 , the debye - like singly peaked as well as the doubly peaked curves , merge together for large @xmath8 into one batch that tends to the value of @xmath122 . note that figure 1 also shows the same general form of a central dense batch of debye - like curves and other different graphs in the upper part of the figure .",
    "these graphs , however , show no sign of double peak , even when finely graphed in the neighbourhood of the critical temperature .",
    "thus , one may conclude that the double peak phenomenon is related to the number of barriers so that it is more apparent for the large number of them as seen from figure 4 which shows 39 different curves of the specific heats , for @xmath110 , as functions of the temperature in the range @xmath123 .",
    "each curve is for a different integral value of @xmath1 in the range @xmath124 . as in the former figures the similar debye like curves in the central part of the figure are for large @xmath1 s and the partition function , for these values of the parameter @xmath1 , therefore should contain some mathematical features in common with the partition function for the vibrational modes of solid crystals .",
    "the other curves are for small @xmath1 s and they may correspond , as in the former figures , to `` soft '' substances .",
    "we note that seven of the curves have each a part below the debye - like curves and a part above them and so they resemble , in a more apparent manner than figure 3 , the remarked double peak phenomena @xcite . the second peak , in our case , is obtained at a comparatively large value of the temperature ( @xmath125 ) compared to the values ( @xmath126 ) in @xcite and to the value of @xmath121 in figure 3 .",
    "note also that the maximum values obtained by the curves of this figure are unity , whereas , most of the curves in the former figures have maxima that exceed unity .",
    "all the curves of figure 4 show for small values of @xmath8 , as in the former figures , peaks that are suggestive of phase transitions .",
    "thus , as remarked , the double peak appearance is more pronounced for the larger values of @xmath0 , but we note that as @xmath0 becomes larger the second peak diminishes in height until it disappears entirely for large enough @xmath0 and remains only the first peak for small @xmath8 .",
    "but , as we see in section 3 , for the limit @xmath2 the double peak phase transition is seen for a larger range of @xmath1 than for finite @xmath0 .",
    "we can find the corresponding critical exponent @xcite @xmath127 associated with these phase transitions by noting , after studying and analysing the behaviour of these curves in the immediate neighbourhood of the critical temperature @xmath128 , that we can write an analytical approximate expression for the specific heat , in the neighbourhood of these points , as follows @xcite @xmath129 where @xmath130 . as seen , the first order derivative of this specific heat with respect to the temperature diverges at the point @xmath131 and so , the critical exponent @xmath127 is obtained as @xcite @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the derivative of @xmath105 from eq ( [ e11 ] ) with respect to @xmath134 and the unity value of the first term denotes the order ( which is 1 here ) of the derivative of @xmath105 from eq ( [ e11 ] ) which diverges at @xmath131 , that is , the appropriate critical exponent is @xmath135 .",
    "the conspicuous departure of the curve of the specific heat , for small @xmath1 , from that of debye - like behahiour can be explained by noting that the total number of nondegenerate energies , as in @xcite , that satisfies eq ( [ e6 ] ) varies for different values of these @xmath1 s .",
    "moreover , we find , numerically , for all finite @xmath0 and for small @xmath1 , no energy from the lower part of the spectrum that satisfies eq ( [ e6 ] ) for the @xmath74 case .",
    "that is , solutions of eq ( [ e6 ] ) for this case are found , for small @xmath1 s , only from the part of the spectrum that is close to the value of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , when we sum upon all the allowed energies , in order to calculate the average energy and the specific heat , the summation does not include the lower part of the spectrum .",
    "for example , the number of nondegenerate allowed ( energies ) solutions of eq ( [ e6 ] ) , for @xmath114 , @xmath74 and @xmath136 are only 3 , whereas they amount to 311 for @xmath137 .",
    "that is , for the larger values of @xmath1 we have a larger number of additional ( that may be thousands for large potential @xmath9 ) allowed energies , and this yields entirely different values for the average energy @xmath138 and the specific heat @xmath105 derived from it .",
    "the entropy @xmath7 and the specific heat @xmath105 are related by @xcite @xmath139 .",
    "thus , from the last discussion we infer that also the change of the entropy @xmath7 with the temperature @xmath8 jumps at the same values of @xmath8 in which the specific heat @xmath105 jumps .",
    "that is , the change of the entropy with @xmath8 has also phase transition .",
    "moreover , the entropy @xmath7 and the free energy @xmath140 are related by the equation @xcite @xmath141 , so that , differentiating both sides of the last relation with respect to the temperature @xmath8 and using the relation between the specific heat @xmath105 and the entropy @xmath7 we obtain @xmath142 from the last equation we see that the second derivative of the free energy @xmath140 with respect to the temperature @xmath8 also changes steeply at the same values of @xmath8 in which @xmath105 does so .",
    "when @xmath1 becomes very large we have @xmath143 , so that we may ignore @xmath13 compared to @xmath15 .",
    "thus , writing the trigonometric functions of the components of @xmath8 from eq ( [ e3 ] ) as exponentials , substituting in eq ( [ e2 ] ) , and ignoring , as noted , @xmath13 with respect to @xmath15 we can see that the matrix @xmath51 from eq ( [ e2 ] ) becomes in the limit of a very large @xmath1 the two dimensional unit matrix . in this case",
    "eq ( [ e6 ] ) , from which the energy spectrum is obtained , becomes the same as eq ( [ e8 ] ) from which the energy spectrum has been obtained as @xmath144 .",
    "but we note that whereas eq ( [ e8 ] ) was obtained for the case of high energies only for which the index @xmath25 begins from a large value @xmath78 ( @xmath145 ) , here , in the limit of very large @xmath1 , @xmath25 assumes all integer values of @xmath146 . in this case",
    "the average energy is @xmath147 note that @xmath148 from the last equation does not depend upon the number of barriers @xmath0 .",
    "the specific heat is @xmath149 plotting the curve of the specific heat from the last equation as a function of the temperature ( not shown here ) one can see that at small @xmath8 @xmath150 varies rapidly from zero to 0.52 from which it descends sharply to its asymptotic value of 0.5 .",
    "the curve is not differentiable at the point at which it assumes the value of 0.52 and so this point appears to be a phase transition one .",
    "we discuss , now , the case where the number of barriers @xmath0 tends to the limit @xmath2 .",
    "we may use for this case the equations ( [ e1])-([e2 ] ) derived for the finite @xmath0 case in the previous section , so that taking the limit of a very large @xmath0 one obtains from eq ( [ e2 ] ) for the right hand side of the potential barrier system at the point @xmath11 where @xmath69 @xcite @xmath152=\\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } e^{-ik(a+b ) }   & 0 \\\\0 & e^{ik(a+b ) } \\end{array } \\right ] \\biggl ( \\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } e^{\\frac{ikb}{n}}&0\\\\ 0&e^{-\\frac{ikb}{n } } \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } t_{11}&t_{12 } \\\\t_{21}&t_{22}\\end{array } \\right ] \\biggr ) ^{n } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_1 \\\\ b_1   \\end{array } \\right ] = \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } e^{-ik(a+b ) }   & 0 \\\\0 & e^{ik(a+b ) } \\end{array } \\right](1+\\frac{i}{n}((kb+aq\\frac{\\xi}{2 } )   \\sigma_3+iaq\\frac{\\eta}{2}\\sigma_2))^n\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_1 \\\\ b_1   \\end{array } \\right ] = \\label{e16 } \\\\ & & = \\exp(-ik(a+b)\\sigma_3)\\exp(i((kb+\\frac{aq\\xi}{2})\\sigma_3 + \\frac{iaq\\eta}{2}\\sigma_2 ) ) \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_1 \\\\ b_1 \\end{array } \\right ] \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the middle expression was obtained by expanding in a taylor series the cosine and sine functions and keeping only terms of the order @xmath153 and the last result by using the relation @xmath154 , where @xmath1 is some constant .",
    "the @xmath155 , and @xmath156 are the two dimensional pauli matrices @xmath157 $ ] , @xmath158 $ ] .",
    "the second exponent of the last result of eq ( [ e16 ] ) may be expanded in a taylor series , so that after collecting corresponding terms we obtain @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are defined as @xcite @xmath162 thus , making use of the relation @xmath163 , and defining @xmath164 we obtain from eqs ( [ e16])-([e17 ] ) for the @xmath35 case @xcite @xmath165=\\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } e^{-iz}(\\cos{\\phi}+if\\frac{\\sin(\\phi)}{\\phi } ) & ie^{-iz}d\\frac{\\sin(\\phi)}{\\phi }   \\\\ -e^{iz}d\\frac{\\sin(\\phi)}{\\phi}&e^{iz}(\\cos{\\phi}-if\\frac{\\sin(\\phi)}{\\phi } ) \\end{array } \\right]\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_1 \\\\ b_1 \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] for the @xmath74 case we use eqs ( [ e4 ] ) , and the corresponding quantities @xcite @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 @xmath169 to obtain the following matrix equation equivalent to eq ( [ e18 ] ) . @xmath170=\\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } e^{-iz}(\\cos{\\grave \\phi}+\\frac{i\\grave f\\sin(\\grave \\phi)}{\\grave \\phi } )   & -ie^{-iz}\\frac{\\grave d\\sin(\\grave \\phi)}{\\grave \\phi }   \\\\ ie^{iz}\\frac{\\grave d\\sin(\\grave \\phi)}{\\grave \\phi } & e^{iz}(\\cos{\\grave \\phi}- i\\frac{\\grave f\\sin(\\grave \\phi)}{\\grave \\phi } ) \\end{array } \\right]\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_1 \\\\ b_1 \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] we can , now , find the energy epectrum of the dense system in an equivalent way to the finite @xmath0 case of the previous section . for both cases of @xmath35 and @xmath74 , we obtain equations similar to eq ( [ e5 ] ) , but now the two dimensional matrices @xmath51 are those on the right hand side of eqs ( [ e18]),([e19 ] ) , where their four components are given explicitly .",
    "note that the four components of the two dimensional matrix @xmath51 for finite @xmath0 ( see eq ( [ e2 ] ) ) can be obtained only numerically .",
    "thus , using , for the @xmath35 case , the explicit expression of @xmath51 from eq ( [ e18 ] ) we can write the analogous equation ( for @xmath2 ) to eq ( [ e6 ] ) as @xmath171=\\frac{e^{4ikc}}{q^2_{22}}-\\frac{2e^{2ikc}}{q_{22}}+1 + \\frac{q_{12}q_{21}e^{4ikc}}{q^2_{22}}=\\label{e20 } \\\\   & & = \\cos(4kc)(1+\\frac{d^2\\sin^2(\\phi)}{\\phi^2})+\\cos(2z)(\\cos^2(\\phi)- \\frac{f^2\\sin^2(\\phi)}{\\phi^2})+\\frac{2f\\sin(\\phi)}{\\phi}(\\sin(2z)\\cos(\\phi)- \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\sin(2kc+z))-2\\cos(2kc+z)\\cos(\\phi)+   i(\\sin(4kc)(1+\\frac{d^2\\sin^2(\\phi)}{\\phi^2})+\\sin(2z)(\\cos^2(\\phi)- \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{f^2\\sin^2(\\phi)}{\\phi^2 } ) + \\frac{2f\\sin(\\phi)}{\\phi } ( \\cos(2kc+z)-\\cos(2z)\\cos(\\phi))-2\\sin(2kc+z)\\cos(\\phi ) ) = 0 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath74 case we use the explicit expression of @xmath51 from eq ( [ e19 ] ) to obtain a similar equation to eq ( [ e20 ] ) from which the energy spectrum for the @xmath74 case may be obtained .    defining the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath172 as @xmath173 one can obtain the eigenvalues of either eq ( [ e18 ] ) or ( [ e19 ] ) in the form @xmath174 the eigenvalues of the @xmath35 case are obtained by substituting the correct @xmath175 ( see the inline equation after eq ( [ e17 ] ) ) and those of the @xmath74 case by substituting the corresponding quantity ( see the displayed equation after eq ( [ e18 ] ) ) . from eq ( [ e21 ] ) one can see that the derivatives of the eigenvalues @xmath176 may be singular at certain values of @xmath175 so that they fulfil the condition in @xcite for finding phase transition in a one dimensional system .",
    "this condition is necessary but may not be sufficient .",
    "our numerical results suggest that such a transition occurs .",
    "the energy spectrum is composed from those energies that satisfy the real and imaginary parts of the last equation for the @xmath35 case and the corresponding one for the @xmath74 case .",
    "thus , we may obtain the average energy @xmath177 for each value of @xmath1 as in eq ( [ e9 ] ) ( without , of course the dependence upon @xmath0 ) . from these average energies",
    "we obtain the corresponding specific heats @xmath178 as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "note that although eq ( [ e20 ] ) , from which we derive the average energy @xmath177 and the specific heat @xmath178 , is obtained analytically compared to the corresponding eq ( [ e6 ] ) for finite @xmath0 , nevertheless , these @xmath178 have the same form as those of the finite @xmath0 ( obtained by differentiating eq ( [ e9 ] ) with respect to @xmath8 ) and are therefore difficult to study analytically .",
    "this is true , especially , for small @xmath8 where the phase transitions are generally encountered .",
    "the dependence of @xmath178 upon the temperature @xmath8 , as a function of @xmath1 , is , for small @xmath8 , different from the dependence discussed in the previous section for finite @xmath0 .",
    "that is , it jumps up to its peak value from which it immediately jumps down to rise again to anther higher maximum .",
    "we note that , generally , for finite @xmath0 there is only one peak maximum , and although in figures 3 and 4 we see several curves that have double peaks , nevertheless , this is only for small @xmath1 and that when @xmath1 grows the curves become the same as that of debye as seen in the dense central part of figures 3 - 4 which are for large @xmath1 .",
    "compared to this the double peak appearance of the specific heat curves for infinite @xmath0 is retained even for large @xmath1 as can be seen from figure 5 which is drawn for @xmath179 .",
    "figure 6 shows 30 different curves of the specific heats as function of the temperature .",
    "each curve is for a different value of @xmath1 from the set @xmath180 .",
    "note the large difference in the heights of the two peaks of each curve , and that both are points where the first derivative with respect to the temperature @xmath8 attains a very large value and so they appear to be phase transition points .",
    "a similar discussion to that of the finite @xmath0 case ( see also eqs ( [ e11 ] ) , ( [ e12 ] ) ) yields a critical exponent of @xmath135 for both peaks . that is ,",
    "producing these curves in a fine grained manner in the immediate neighbourhood of the critical temperature @xmath128 we realize , as for finite @xmath0 ( see the discussion before eq ( [ e11 ] ) ) that we may approximate analytically the form of @xmath178 by eq ( [ e11 ] ) with a critical exponent of @xmath181 . indeed , comparing the forms of the curves for finite @xmath0 to those of the infinite @xmath0 in the neighbourhood of the critical temperature @xmath128 one does not find a large differece .",
    "moreover , as @xmath1 grows both kinds of curves show generally , except for the double peak appearance which is retained for the infinite @xmath0 even for large @xmath1 , the same behaviour which characterizes the debye - type curves .",
    "this may be seen from figure 7 which shows 40 different curves of the specific heat as functions of the temperature @xmath8 for integral values of @xmath1 from @xmath182 . comparing these curves to those of figure 6 which are drawn for smaller",
    "@xmath1 one sees that the dense batch of similar curves in the central part of the figure , which characterizes the solid crystals ( as we have encountered in the former figures ) , have appeared also for the infinite @xmath0 case .",
    "this is because of the larger values of @xmath1 , for which figure 7 is graphed , that enable , as for the finite @xmath0 case , a debye - like forms for these curves .",
    "note that this form is absent in figure 6 ( and also in figure 2 ) because all the curves there are drawn for small @xmath1 .",
    "the other curves in figure 7 that are not part of the central dense batch are for the smaller values of @xmath1 and , therefore , they are similar to those of figure 6 . as noted , the difference between the finite and infinite @xmath0 lies , especially , in the double peak phenomenon that is seen in the infinite @xmath0 case even for large values of @xmath1 as can be seen from figure 5 .",
    "when figure 7 is produced in a fine grained manner in the neighbourhood of the critical temperature @xmath128 one can see clearly the double peak for any curve as in figure 5 . as the temperature increases",
    "all the curves tend to the value of 0.55 as for the finite @xmath0 case .",
    "when @xmath1 becomes very large the curves ( not shown here ) of the specific heats become similar to each other and to the debye graph .",
    "we infer from the former results that also the first derivative of the entropy @xmath7 and the second derivative of the free energy @xmath140 , both with respect to the temperature , change in an abrupt manner at the same values of @xmath8 ( see the analogous discussion at the previous section ) .",
    "we have shown that the one - dimensional multibarrier potential of finite range shows signs of phase transitions in specific heat for certain values of the temperature @xmath8 .",
    "these phase transitions depend upon the number of barriers @xmath0 and the ratio @xmath1 of the total spacing to their total width and are demonstrated for both cases of finite and infinite number @xmath0 as shown in figures 1 - 7 and also for small and large values of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , it is seen from the curves of the specific heat as a function of the temperature for @xmath183 and small @xmath1 ( see figure 4 ) and for infinite @xmath0 and a large range of @xmath1 ( see figures 5 - 7 ) that the phase transitions appear in a double peak form .",
    "double peaks have been seen in antiferromagnetic and superconducting materials and are apparently associated with dynamically induced phase transitions @xcite and in the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "we note that we have found @xcite that the one - dimensional multibarrier system discussed here demonstrates also , for large @xmath0 , a unit value for the transmission probability and signs of chaos which may be interpreted in terms of effective decoherence and the space analog @xcite of the zeno effect @xcite in which a very large number of repetitions of the same experiment ( interaction ) , in a finite total time , preserves the initial state of the system .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that a beam of light that passes through a large number of analyzers arrayed along a finite interval of a spatial axis , a configuration which is very similar to the one discussed here , remains after the passage with the same initial polarization and intensity it had before passing .",
    "this kind of preservation of the initial `` state '' by passing through a large number of physical apparatuses , each of them is supposed by itself to change the state of the passing system , has also been shown in the _ classical _ regime @xcite where the initial density of classical particles passing through a one dimensional array of imperfect traps @xcite remains at the same value it had before the passage if the ratio of the total spacing to width ( which corresponds to the ratio @xmath1 here ) increases .    thus , our finding here that when @xmath1 grows the curves of the specific heat , as functions of the temperature @xmath8 , become similar to the known graph of debye @xcite , indicates that the system makes a transition to the physical situation which behaves like the vibrational modes of a solid crystal .",
    "we have found that the critical exponents associated with these phase transitions have the value @xmath135 .",
    "the other statistical parameters associated with the specific heat such as the entropy and the free energy also demonstrate , in the rate of their changes with respect to the temperature @xmath8 , the same type of behaviour at the same values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath8 .",
