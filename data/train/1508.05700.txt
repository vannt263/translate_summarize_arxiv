    "one of the most important issues in many - body physics is to clarify the nature of correlations beyond the independent particle picture . in nuclear physics ,",
    "the pairing correlation has been well recognized as a typical many - boy correlation@xcite , which leads to a characteristic even - odd staggering of biding energy providing an extra binding for even - mass nuclei . a pairing",
    "interaction scatters nucleon pairs from a single - particle level below the fermi surface to those above , and as a consequence , each single - particle level is occupied with a fractional occupation probability .    with the pairing correlation",
    ", one may naively expect that two nucleons forming a pair are located at a similar position inside a nucleus .",
    "a spatial structure of two valence neutrons has in fact attracted much attention in the past .",
    "one of the earliest publications on this problem is by bertsch , broglia , and riedel , who solved a shell model for @xmath0pb and showed that the two valence neutrons are strongly clusterized @xcite .",
    "subsequently , migdal argued that two neutrons may be bound in a nucleus even though they are not bound in the vacuum @xcite .",
    "the strong localization of two neutrons inside a nucleus has been referred to as the _ di - neutron correlation_. it has been nicely demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that an admixture of confiurations of single - particle orbits with opposite parity is essential to create the strong di - neutron correlation .",
    "this implies that the pairing correlation acting only on single - particle orbits with the same parity is not sufficient in order to develop the di - neutron correlation , and the pairing model space needs to be taken sufficiently largely so that both positive parity and negative parity states are included .",
    "although the di - neutron correlation exists even in stable nuclei , it is therefore more enhanced in weakly bound nuclei because the admixtures of single - particle orbits with different parities are easier due to the couplings to the continuum spectra@xcite .",
    "three - body model calculations have revealed that a strong di - neutron correlation indeed exists in weakly - bound borromean nuclei , such as @xmath1li and @xmath2he @xcite .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ density ] shows the two - particle density for the @xmath1li and @xmath2he nuclei obtained with the three - body model calculation with a density dependent contact pairing interaction @xcite .",
    "one can see that the densities are concentrated in the region with small opening angles , that is nothing but the di - neutron correlation .",
    "it has been shown that the di - neutron correlation exists also in heavier neutron - rich nuclei @xcite as well as in infinite neutron matter @xcite",
    ". the di - proton correlation , which is a counter part of the di - neutron correlation , has also been shown to exist in the proton - rich borromean nucleus , @xmath3ne@xcite .    from these studies , the di - neutron correlation seems to have been theoretically established .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to probe it experimentally . in this contribution",
    ", we discuss how one can probe the di - neutron correlation . to be more specific",
    ", we shall discuss the coulomb breakup , the two - neutron transfer reactions , and the two - nucleon radioactivity as possible probes for the correlation .",
    "let us first discuss the coulomb breakup reactions of borromean nuclei , @xmath1li and @xmath2he , for which the experimental data have been available in refs . @xcite .",
    "those experimental breakup cross sections , especially those for the @xmath1li nucleus , show a strong concentration in the low excitation region , reflecting the halo structure of these nuclei .",
    "moreover , the experimental data for @xmath1li are consistent only with the theoretical calculation which takes into account the interaction between the valence neutrons , strongly suggesting the existence of the di - neutron correlation in this nucleus ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the coulomb breakup of borromean nuclei",
    ", one can go one step further , given that the coulomb breakup process takes place predominantly by the dipole excitation .",
    "the coulomb breakup cross sections with the absorption of dipole photons are given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of virtual photons , and @xmath6 is the reduced @xmath7 transition probability .",
    "in this equation , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the wave functions for the initial and the final states , respectively , @xmath10 is the spin of the initial state , and @xmath11 is the operator for the @xmath7 transition . for the borromean nuclei , assuming a three - body structure with an inert core , the @xmath7 operator @xmath11 reads @xcite , @xmath12 where the e1 effective charge is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the mass and charge numbers for the core nucleus . @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the coordinates for the valence neutrons .    using eq .",
    "( [ be1 ] ) and the closure relation for the final state , it is easy to derive that the total e1 strength ( that is , the non - energy weighted sum rule ) is proportional to the expectation value of the center of mass coordinate for the two valence neutrons , @xmath18 , with respect to the ground state , that is , @xmath19 with @xmath20 . even though the @xmath21 strength distribution inevitably reflects both the correlation in the ground state and that in the final state , it is remarkable that one can extract the information which reflects _ solely _ the ground state properties after summing all the strength distribution",
    "this implies that the average value of the opening angle between the valence neutrons can be directly extracted from the measured total @xmath21 value once the root - mean - square distance between the valence neutrons , @xmath22 , is available ( see fig .",
    "[ geometry ] ) .",
    "this quantity is related to the matter radius and @xmath23 in the three - body model as @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass number of the whole nucleus .",
    "the matter radii @xmath26 can be estimated from interaction cross sections . employing the glauber theory in the optical limit , tanihata _ et al .",

    ", we obtain the rms neutron - neutron distance of @xmath31 = 3.75 @xmath28 0.93 and 5.50 @xmath28 2.24 fm for @xmath2he and @xmath1li , respectively . combining these values with the rms core - di - neutron distance ,",
    "@xmath32 , we obtain the mean opening angle of @xmath33 = 51.56@xmath34 and 56.2@xmath35 degrees for @xmath2he and @xmath1li , respectively @xcite . these values are comparable to the result of the three - body model calculation , @xmath33=66.33 and 65.29 degree for @xmath2he and @xmath1li , respectively @xcite , although the experimental values are somewhat smaller .",
    "an alternative way to extract the value for @xmath36 has been proposed which uses the three - body correlation study in the dissociation of two neutrons in halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "the two neutron correlation function provides the experimental values for @xmath31 to be 5.9 @xmath28 1.2 and 6.6 @xmath28 1.5 fm for @xmath2he , @xmath1li , respectively @xcite .",
    "bertulani and hussein used these values to estimate the mean opening angles and obtained @xmath33=83 @xmath37 and 66 @xmath38 degrees for @xmath2he and @xmath1li , respectively @xcite . after correcting the effect of pauli forbidden transitions using the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , these values are slightly altered to be @xmath33=74.5 @xmath39 and 65.2 @xmath40 degrees for @xmath2he and @xmath1li , respectively @xcite .",
    "notice that these values are in a better agreement with the results of the three - body calculation @xcite , especially for the @xmath2he nucleus .    in the absence of the correlations ,",
    "the mean opening angle is exactly @xmath33=90 degrees .",
    "the extracted values of @xmath33 are significantly smaller than this value both for @xmath1li and @xmath2he , providing a direct proof of the existence of the di - neutron correlation in these nuclei .",
    "a small drawback is that this method provides only the average value of @xmath33 and a detailed distribution is inaccessible . in reality",
    ", the mean opening angle is most probably an average of a smaller and a larger correlation angles in the density distribution , as has been shown in fig . [ density ] .",
    "it has been recognized for a long time that two - neutron transfer reactions are sensitive to the pairing correlation@xcite .",
    "the probability for the two - neutron transfer process is enhanced as compared to a naive expectation of sequential transfer process , that is , the square of one - neutron transfer probability@xcite .",
    "the enhancement of pair transfer probability has been attributed to the pairing effect , such as the surface localization of a cooper pair@xcite .",
    "the pair transfer reaction is thus considered to provide a promising way to probe the di - neutron correlation .",
    "however , the reaction dynamics is rather complicated and has not yet been well established .",
    "for instance , it is only with a recent calculation that a theoretical calculation achieves a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data @xcite",
    ". it would therefore be not surprising that the role of di - neutron in the pair transfer reaction has not yet been fully clarified .",
    "one such example is a relative importance of the one - step ( the direct pair transfer ) process and the two - step ( the sequential pair transfer ) process . in heavy - ion pair transfer reactions of stable nuclei ,",
    "both processes are known to play a role @xcite . for weakly - bound nuclei ,",
    "most of the intermediate states for the two - step process are likely in the continuum spectra .",
    "it is still an open question how this fact , together with the @xmath41-value matching condition , alters the dynamics of the pair transfer reaction of neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the cross sections for the pair transfer reaction of the borromean nuclei , @xmath1li and @xmath2he , have been measured recently @xcite .",
    "the data for the @xmath42h(@xmath1li,@xmath30li)@xmath43h reaction at 3 mev / nucleon indicate that the cross sections are indeed sensitive to the pair correlation in the ground state of @xmath1li @xcite .",
    "that is , the experimental cross sections can be accounted for only when the @xmath44-wave component is mixed in the ground state of @xmath1li by 30 - 50% .",
    "another important finding in this measurement is that significant cross sections were observed for the pair transfer process to the first excited state of @xmath30li @xcite , which has made a good support for the idea of phonon mediated pairing mechanism @xcite .",
    "further theoretical studies are apparently necessary in order to understand the connection between the two - neutron transfer process and the di - neutron correlation in borromean nuclei .",
    "this has been left for future investigations .",
    "in the coulomb breakup process discussed in sec .",
    "2 , the ground state wave function of a two - neutron halo nucleus is firstly perturbed by the external electromagnetic field of the target nucleus",
    ". it may thus not be easy to disentangle the di - neutron correlation in the ground state from that in the excited states .",
    "the two - proton radioactivity , that is , a spontaneous emission of two valence protons , of proton - rich nuclei @xcite is expected to provide a good tool to probe the di - proton correlation in the initial wave function",
    ". an attractive feature of this phenomenon is that the two valence protons are emitted directly from the ground state even without any external perturbation .",
    "very recently , the ground state _ two - neutron _ emissions have also been observed , _",
    "e.g. , _ in @xmath45he @xcite , @xmath46be @xcite , @xmath47li @xcite , and @xmath48o @xcite .",
    "this is an analogous process of the two - proton radioactivity , corresponding to a penetration of two neutrons over a centrifugal barrier . since the long range coulomb interaction is absent",

    "the coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 are such that the interference term in the two - particle density , @xmath92 , is positive for @xmath93 while it is negative for @xmath94 so that the two - particle density is enhanced for the nearside configuration with @xmath95 as compared to the far side configuration with @xmath96 .",
