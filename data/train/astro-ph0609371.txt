    "the luminosity function of globular clusters ( gcs ) represents one of the most remarkable features of these stellar systems .",
    "the distribution of gc magnitudes , commonly referred to as the gc luminosity function ( gclf ) , shows a turnover , or peak , at @xmath9 mag , corresponding to a mass of @xmath10 .",
    "observations have shown that this turnover is nearly invariant across and within galaxies , prompting its widespread use as a distance indicator ( see , e.g. , harris 2001 ) .",
    "accounting for this nearly universal mass scale remains an open problem for theories of gc formation and evolution .",
    "it follows that establishing whether or not the gclf as a whole is universal  i.e. , whether its overall form depends on host galaxy properties  can help guide and constrain theories for the formation and evolution of galaxies and gc systems .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we present results from a study of the gclfs of 89 early - type galaxies observed by hst as part of the acs virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs ; ct et al .",
    "we find the clearest evidence to date for a correlation between the width ( i.e. , gaussian dispersion ) of the gclf and the luminosity of the host galaxy ; we also show that there is some downward scatter in the _ mass _ scale of the gclf turnover in galaxies fainter than @xmath8 . focusing on the observed steepening of the gclf at the bright ( high - mass ) end in the faint galaxies ,",
    "we argue that this behavior was probably imprinted at the time of gc formation .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the whole gclf , including the faint ( low - mass ) end and the role that long - term dynamical evolution plays in that regime , is deferred to a subsequent paper ( jordn et  al .",
    "2006 , hereafter j06 ) . that paper presents our data in full and gives details of our analysis techniques , including modeling of the gclfs with a new , non - gaussian , physically motivated fitting function",
    "one hundred early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster were observed in the acsvcs ( ct et  al .",
    "each galaxy was imaged for 750 s in the f475w bandpass ( @xmath11 sloan  @xmath12 ) and for 1210 s in f850lp ( @xmath11 sloan  @xmath13 ) .",
    "reductions were performed as described in jordn et  al .",
    "in what follows , we use @xmath12 and @xmath13 as shorthand to refer to the f475w and f850lp filters .",
    "one of the main scientific objectives of the acsvcs is the study of gc systems , and thus we have developed methods to : ( 1 ) discard foreground stars and background galaxies from the totality of observed sources around each target galaxy in the survey ; and ( 2 ) estimate the level of residual fore- and background contamination in the remaining sources designated as candidate gcs .",
    "these procedures are described and illustrated by peng et al .",
    "( 2006a ; their  2.2 and figure  1 ) , and discussed in detail in the gclf context in j06 . in the latter paper",
    ", we also examine the effects of using alternate selection criteria to define gc samples , and show that the results presented here are fully robust against such subtleties .    of the 100 galaxies in the acsvcs ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to those that have more than five gcs , as estimated by subtracting the total number of expected contaminants from the full list of gc candidates for each galaxy .",
    "we additionally eliminate two galaxies for which we were unable to obtain useful measurements of the gclf parameters .",
    "this leaves a final sample of 89 galaxies which are studied here , and in j06 .    also as part of the acsvcs",
    ", we have measured the distances to 84 of our target galaxies using the method of surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ; mei et  al .",
    "we use these sbf distances to transform the observed gc and galaxy magnitudes into absolute ones whenever possible . for those galaxies lacking an sbf distance",
    ", we adopt the mean distance modulus to the virgo cluster : @xmath14  mag , or @xmath15  mpc ( see mei et  al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "we use an approach similar to that of secker & harris ( 1993 ) to characterize the gclfs : parametric models are fitted to the observed luminosity functions via a maximum - likelihood method that takes into account photometric errors , incompleteness , and the luminosity function of contaminants .",
    "full technical details are given in j06 , where we consider two parametric models for the gclf .",
    "the first , on which this paper will focus , is the standard gaussian distribution , @xmath16\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : gauss}\\ ] ] the second is a simple analytical modification of a schechter ( 1976 ) function designed to account for the effects of cluster evaporation ( two - body relaxation ) on a gc mass function that is assumed to have initially resembled that of the young clusters forming today in local mergers and starbursts .",
    "full details on these two models are given in j06 , where we fit each of them to the separate @xmath12- and @xmath13-band gclfs of our 89 program galaxies .",
    "in this _ letter _",
    "we present only the results of gaussian fits to the @xmath13-band gclfs .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma_b ] shows our main result : gclfs are narrower in lower - luminosity galaxies .",
    "the straight line in this plot of gaussian dispersion against absolute galaxy magnitude shows the least - squares fit @xmath17    it has been reported before that the gclfs in lower - luminosity galaxies tend to show somewhat lower dispersions ( e.g. , kundu & whitmore 2001 ) .",
    "however , the size and homogeneity of the acsvcs dataset make this the most convincing demonstration to date of a continuous trend in gclf shape over a range of @xmath18 in galaxy luminosity .",
    "monte carlo simulations and alternate constructions of gclf samples show that the observed decrease in dispersion is _ not _ an artifact of small - number statistics in the faint galaxies ( j06 ) .",
    "past investigations have pointed to a dependence of the gclf dispersion on the hubble type of the gc host galaxies ( e.g. , harris 1991 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma_b ] includes datapoints at the location of the bulge magnitude and gclf dispersion of the milky way ( large star ) and m31 ( large triangle ) .",
    "since both systems fall comfortably on the relation defined by our data for early - type galaxies , we conclude that the underlying fundamental correlation is one between @xmath0 and @xmath19 , rather than between @xmath0 and hubble type .",
    "a natural question at this point is whether the observed trend in gclf dispersion with galaxy magnitude implies a similar trend in the gc _ mass _ function .",
    "this is not a foregone conclusion , for the following reason .",
    "gc systems are known to have systematically redder and broader ( or more strongly bimodal ) color distributions in brighter galaxies than in faint ones ( see , e.g. , peng et al .",
    "equivalently , gcs in giant galaxies are more metal - rich on average , and have larger dispersions in [ fe / h ] , than those in low - mass dwarfs .",
    "since cluster mass - to - light ratios , @xmath20 , are functions of [ fe / h ] in general , it is conceivable that the average gc @xmath20 could change systematically in going from bright galaxies to fainter ones , and that the spread of @xmath20 values within a single gc system could also vary systematically as a function of galaxy magnitude .",
    "the possibility then exists that narrower gclfs for faint galaxies might result from these systematics in @xmath20 combined with a more nearly invariant spread in gc masses .",
    "we can show easily , however , that this is not the case .",
    "the systematics in @xmath20 vs.  [ fe / h ] just mentioned are also a function of wavelength . in bluer filters , such as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , or @xmath12 , mass - to - light ratios of old stellar systems",
    "do change significantly ( increasing by factors of two or more ) in going from cluster metallicities @xmath23 } \\la -2 $ ] to @xmath23}=0 $ ] , typical of gcs .",
    "but at the much redder wavelengths of our @xmath13-band data ( @xmath24   ; sirianni et  al .",
    "2005 ) , this strong metallicity dependence almost completely disappears . we have used the pegase population - synthesis model of fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1997 ) to compute @xmath25 as a function of metallicity for clusters with a kennicutt ( 1983 ) stellar imf and various fixed ages @xmath26 . for @xmath27  gyr , we find that @xmath28 at an extreme @xmath23}=-2.3 $ ] , decreasing to a minimum of @xmath29 at @xmath23}\\simeq-0.7 $ ] , and then increasing slightly to @xmath30 at @xmath23}=0 $ ] .",
    "in other words , we always have @xmath31 for any of the globular clusters in any of our sample galaxies  no matter how red or blue the clusters are , or how broad or narrow the gc color / metallicity distribution .",
    "comparably small ranges of @xmath25 result if younger gc ages or different reasonable stellar imfs are assumed .",
    "the effect of variations in mass - to - light ratio on the width of the gclf at nir wavelengths is therefore completely negligible . from figure",
    "[ fig : sigma_b ] , we have that @xmath32 in our galaxies , whereas the discussion above implies that @xmath33 for our gcs , such that the dispersion of mass - to - light ratios in any one system is always @xmath34 at an absolute maximum .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion of logarithmic gc _ masses _ , @xmath35^{1/2}$ ] , is thus never more than @xmath36 different from the observed @xmath37 .",
    "we conclude , unavoidably , that the steady decrease of @xmath38 by more than 50% from the brightest giants to the faintest dwarfs in figure  [ fig : sigma_b ] is an accurate reflection of just such a trend in the intrinsic gc mass distributions .",
    "we now turn our attention to the gclf turnover magnitude .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : mu_b ] shows the mean gc absolute magnitude @xmath39 from the gaussian fits to our gclfs , versus host galaxy @xmath1 .",
    "the horizontal line in this plot is drawn at a level typical of galaxies brighter than @xmath40 : @xmath41 . given a typical @xmath42 in these galaxies ( for gc ages 13 gyr and an average @xmath23}\\approx-1 $ ] ) , this corresponds to a cluster mass scale of @xmath43 .",
    "estimates of the @xmath13-band gclf turnovers in the milky way and m31 are shown by the large star and large triangle , as in figure  [ fig : sigma_b ] . in the lower panel of figure [ fig : mu_b ]",
    "we plot the turnover masses @xmath5 obtained from the fitted @xmath39 using pegase model mass - to - light ratios .",
    "as we have discussed , @xmath13-band luminosities are very good proxies for total gc masses , so this graph is essentially a mirror image of the one above it .",
    "figure  [ fig : mu_b ] shows that there is no strong or systematic variation in @xmath39 or @xmath5 to match that seen for @xmath38 ( figure  [ fig : sigma_b ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is a clear tendency for the gclf turnovers of galaxies fainter than @xmath8 to scatter to somewhat fainter ( less massive ) values than is typical of the bright giants .",
    "the difference in mass is a factor of @xmath44 on average , but it ranges apparently randomly , from a factor of 1 ( i.e. , no difference ) up to factors slightly greater than 2 in some cases . note that there is a healthy mix of e and s0 or de and ds0 galaxies at all magnitudes in our acsvcs sample ( see table 1 of ct et al .",
    "we find no tendency for any particular hubble type to scatter preferentially away from @xmath41 or @xmath45 in figure [ fig : mu_b ] .",
    "the lower mean value for @xmath5 at faint @xmath1 clearly can impact the use of the gclf as a standard candle for dwarf galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect is wavelength - dependent .",
    "publicly available codes such as pegase can be used easily to show that in bluer bandpasses such as @xmath12 ( or the closely related @xmath22 , which is more standard for such studies ) , the slight decrease we find for the average gc turnover _ mass _ in fainter galaxies is balanced by a comparable decrease in the typical gc mass - to - light ratio ( because of the lower cluster metallicities ) , so that the mean turnover _ magnitude _ does not vary as in the @xmath13 band .",
    "we have also confirmed this directly from our own acsvcs data . in j06",
    ", we obtain plots analogous to figures [ fig : sigma_b ] and [ fig : mu_b ] from fits to the @xmath12-band gclfs of our galaxies .",
    "the results fully support all of our conclusions here .",
    "it is particularly worth noting that we find a relation identical to equation ( [ eq : sigmaz ] ) for the dependence of @xmath12-band gclf dispersion on parent galaxy luminosity .",
    "an obvious question prompted by figure [ fig : sigma_b ] is whether the correlation between @xmath38 and @xmath1 was established at the time of cluster formation or built up afterwards as gclfs were modified by the dynamical destruction of gcs over a hubble time .",
    "we favor the first interpretation .",
    "star clusters can be destroyed over gyr timescales as a result of mass loss driven by stellar evolution , dynamical friction , gravitational shocks , and internal two - body relaxation ( evaporation )  processes that have been studied in detail by several groups .",
    "recent discussions , centered specifically on how these affect the gclf , can be found in fall & zhang ( 2001 ) and vesperini ( 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "fall & zhang in particular show that , while stellar evolution and gravitational shocks certainly deplete the total number of gcs in a galaxy , they do not significantly alter the overall shape of the gclf .",
    "evaporation , on the other hand , _ can _ change the shape of the gclf , but significantly so only for cluster masses @xmath46-@xmath47 , i.e. , below the typical gclf turnover mass .    in the theoretical treatments of fall & zhang , vesperini , and many others ,",
    "the evaporation rate is independent of cluster mass , which ultimately drives the _ low - mass _ side of the gclf to a universal shape : a simple exponential @xmath48 for the number of gcs per unit magnitude fainter than the turnover ( equivalent to a flat distribution for the number of gcs per unit linear luminosity or mass ) . but",
    "fitting a gaussian model to the gclf , as we have done here , tacitly assumes that the distribution is symmetric .",
    "the results in figure [ fig : sigma_b ] might therefore seem to imply that both the bright side _ and _ the faint side of the gclf become progressively steeper in fainter galaxies .",
    "however , various observational uncertainties make it difficult to determine precisely the form of the faintest tail of the gclf .",
    "thus , in j06 we show that good fits to our gclfs can also be obtained using an alternate model with a universal exponential shape at magnitudes fainter than the turnover  and that the downward scatter in @xmath5 for faint galaxies persists in such a model and so is not an artifact of any assumed gaussian symmetry . here",
    "we concern ourselves only with the brighter half of the gclf , which is observationally better defined .",
    "we have performed maximum - likelihood fits of exponential models @xmath49 ( corresponding to power - law _ mass _ distributions , @xmath50 ) to the gclfs at absolute magnitudes @xmath51 ( cluster masses @xmath52@xmath53 ) in 66 of our galaxies .",
    "such distributions accurately describe the bright sides of giant - galaxy gclfs ( harris & pudritz 1994 ; larsen et al . 2001 ) , and with @xmath54 they also give good matches to the mass functions of young star clusters in nearby mergers and starbursts ( zhang & fall 1999 ) .    figure  [ fig : power ] shows the results of this exercise .",
    "there is a clear steepening in the power - law exponent , from @xmath55 in bright galaxies to @xmath56 in the faintest systems .",
    "however the faint side of the gclf behaves in detail , the bright side alone suggests that smaller galaxies were unable to form very massive clusters in the same _ relative _ proportions as giant galaxies .",
    "a potential complication here is dynamical friction .",
    "a cluster of mass @xmath57 on an orbit of radius @xmath58 in a galaxy with circular speed @xmath59 will spiral in to the center of the galaxy on a timescale @xmath60 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . in the milky way and larger galaxies , @xmath61  gyr for",
    "all but the very most massive clusters at small radii , and thus dynamical friction does not significantly affect their gclfs ( e.g. , fall & zhang 2001 ) .",
    "in dwarfs with low @xmath59 , however , @xmath62 can be interestingly short for smaller gcs at larger @xmath58  suggesting , perhaps , that the process might significantly deplete the bright side of the gclf in small galaxies and contribute to the type of trend seen in figure  [ fig : power ] .",
    "however , vesperini ( 2000 , 2001 ) has modeled the gclf evolution over a hubble time in galaxies with a wide range of mass , and his results strongly suggest that dynamical friction does _ not _ suffice to explain our observations . in particular , the widths of the gaussian gclfs in his models do not decrease , even in dwarf galaxies , to anywhere near the extent seen in the data .",
    "thus , any significant galaxy - to - galaxy variations in the shape of the gclf above the turnover mass probably reflect initial conditions ( see j06 for further discussion ) .    in summary , the gradual narrowing of the gclf as a function of galaxy luminosity  or the steepening of the mass distribution above the classic turnover point ",
    "presents a new constraint for theories of gc formation and evolution .",
    "in our view , it is the cluster formation process in particular that is likely to be most relevant to the observed behavior at the high - mass end of the gclf .",
    "exactly what factors might lead to more massive galaxies forming massive clusters in greater relative numbers , is an open question of some interest .",
