    "in this paper we concentrate on two families of digraphs which are cayley digraphs of the plane crystallographic groups .",
    "namely , we consider the @xmath1 and @xmath0 problems for the so - called new amsterdam and manhattan digraphs .",
    "the first problem consists of maximizing the number @xmath2 of vertices giving the ( maximum degree ) @xmath3 and the diameter @xmath4 , whereas the second one ( somehow dual of the first ) consists of minimizing the diameter for a fixed degree and number of vertices .",
    "our study is based on known results about the same problems of another family , the double - step graphs ( also called circulants or cayley graphs of abelian groups ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath1 problem was already solved by morillo , fiol and fbrega in  @xcite for the new amsterdam digraphs with odd diameter , and also for the manhattan digraphs with even diameter .",
    "although a solution for the other diameters was also claimed in the same paper , the digraphs proposed were not vertex transitive and , as a consequence , the eccentricity from the odd vertices was not the correct one .",
    "here we show that , for such values of the diameter , the number of vertices is much smaller than the theoretical upper ( moore - like ) bounds . for a comprehensive survey on moore graphs and the @xmath1 problem , see miller and sirn @xcite .",
    "in this section we define the different families of digraphs considered and recall the corresponding theoretical ( moore - like ) upper bounds for their number of vertices .      a _ double - step graph _",
    "@xmath5 has set of vertices @xmath6 ( the integers modulo @xmath2 ) and every vertex @xmath7 is adjacent to the vertices @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( arithmetic is always @xmath10 ) , for some different integers @xmath11 called _ steps _ such that @xmath12 . for more details ,",
    "see yebra , fiol , morillo and alegre  @xcite .",
    "then , as is readily seen in that paper , the maximum number @xmath13 of vertices of a double - step graph with diameter @xmath14 is upper bounded by the moore - like bound @xmath15      let @xmath2 be an even integer and let @xmath16 be some odd integers ( @xmath17 ) as before called _ steps _ satisfying @xmath18 then , a _ new amsterdam digraph _ @xmath19 is a bipartite digraph with set of vertices @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and where each vertex @xmath24 is adjacent to the vertices @xmath25 , and every vertex @xmath26 is adjacent to the vertices @xmath27 . see figure  [ fig - new - amsterdam - manhattan ] ( left ) for the plane local pattern followed by the vertices .",
    "since the digraph is regular and bipartite , if it has diameter @xmath14 , its maximum number @xmath28 of vertices is twice the number of vertices in @xmath29 when @xmath14 is odd , or in @xmath30 if @xmath14 is even , at distance at most @xmath31 from vertex @xmath32 .",
    "this leads to the following moore - like bounds ( see morillo , fiol , and fbrega @xcite ) :    n_m_(2,k)= 2(1+_m=1^n 4m)=k^2 + 1 & -.25 cm for odd @xmath33,[moore - na - odd ] + 2_m=1^n ( 4m-2)=k^2 & -.25 cm for even @xmath34.[moore - na - even ]     -9 cm",
    "manhattan digraphs were introduced independently ( in slightly different forms and contexts ) by morillo , fiol , and fbrega @xcite and maxemchuk @xcite .",
    "they are called in this way because locally resemble the topology of the avenues and streets of manhattan ( or _ leixample _ in downtown barcelona ) ; see figure  [ fig - new - amsterdam - manhattan ] ( right ) .",
    "more precisely , given an integer @xmath2 multiple of @xmath35 , the _",
    "manhattan digraph _",
    "@xmath36 has set of vertices @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , each vertex @xmath39 is adjacent to the vertices @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where the steps @xmath42 satisfy @xmath43 @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xmath44 , for @xmath46 , and @xmath47    the number of vertices for such a digraphs are upper bounded by the following moore - like bounds ( see again morillo , fiol , and fbrega @xcite ) :    n_m_(2,k)= 2(k-1)^2 & for odd @xmath33 , [ moore - mh - odd ] + 2[(k-1)^2 + 1 ] & for even @xmath34.[moore - mh - even ]",
    "in this section we show that every double - step graph has associated both a new amsterdam digraph and a manhattan digraph . in each step of this process , while the number of vertices is doubled , the diameter only increases ( at most ) by one .",
    "moreover , the relationships between the steps characterizing the digraphs are easily devised by superimposing the corresponding plane patterns .          where @xmath52 are made clear in figure  [ fig - graf - doble - pas+na+m ] .",
    "there are different possible solutions of these equations .",
    "for instance , we can take @xmath53 and we are lead to the following result .",
    "superimposed on a double - step graph @xmath5 .",
    "right : a manhattan digraph @xmath54 , superimposed on a new amsterdam digraph @xmath55 .",
    "the double - step digraph has grey vertices and its edges are dotted lines , the new amsterdam digraph has black vertices and continuous arcs , and the manhattan digraph has white vertices and discontinuous arcs.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] -9.5 cm      let us first prove that there is a path of length at most @xmath62 between any two given vertices @xmath63 of a new amsterdam digraph @xmath64 . by symmetry ,",
    "it is enough to check the cases @xmath65",
    ". then we must distinguish the cases when @xmath66 is even or odd .",
    "* @xmath67 : since @xmath68 and @xmath69 has diameter @xmath14 , for any @xmath70 there exist integers @xmath71 such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 so , multiplying by 2 and using eqs . @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    ", we have that @xmath76 and , hence , @xmath77 .",
    "* @xmath78 : since in at most @xmath79 steps we reach every even vertex from @xmath32 , by using an additional step @xmath80 , eq .",
    "( [ ( 0,2j ) ] ) yields @xmath81 and we reach every odd vertex in at most @xmath62 steps , @xmath82 . * @xmath83 : by using again eq .",
    "( [ ( 0,2j ) ] ) , we have @xmath84 and , hence , @xmath85 .",
    "* @xmath86 : let us consider the value @xmath87",
    ". by the same reasons as before , there exist integers @xmath88 such that @xmath89 and @xmath90 and , hence , using again eqs .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath91 and , so , @xmath92 .            for understanding where eqs .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 come from , see figure  [ fig - graf - doble - pas+na+m ] ( right ) . again",
    ", there are different possible solutions to these equations .",
    "for instance , we can take : @xmath106      as a consequence of the above results ( [ ds->na ] ) , and ( [ na->mh2 ] ) , the following equalities give the steps of a manhattan digraph from the steps of its corresponding double - step graph : @xmath107",
    "as a consequence , we get the following theorem .      as was shown by dalf , comellas , and fiol @xcite , every manhattan digraph can be seen as the line digraph of a new amsterdam digraph .",
    "then , the result is a direct consequence of theorem [ basic - theo ] and the properties of line digraphs .",
    "namely , if @xmath69 is a @xmath113-regular digraph ( different from a directed cycle ) with @xmath2 vertices and diameter @xmath4 , then its line digraph @xmath114 has @xmath115 vertices and diameter @xmath116 .",
    "see more details about the line digraph technique in fiol , yebra and alegre  @xcite .          as it was shown by bermond , iliades and peyrat  @xcite ( see also beivide , herrada , balczar and arruabarrena  @xcite ) , the pair of steps @xmath117 solves both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 problems for the family of double - step graphs .",
    "indeed , we have the following result .",
    "notice that , for such numbers @xmath2 of vertices , @xmath14 is the smallest possible value of the diameter @xmath4 that solves the @xmath0 problem for these graphs .",
    "moreover , for diameter @xmath57 , the number @xmath120 is the maximum possible number of vertices , so solving the corresponding @xmath1 problem .",
    "@xmath132 when @xmath124 is within the range of @xmath132 , theorems [ bermond - theo ] and [ basic - theo ] yield that the diameter is @xmath133 but , from the moore bounds ( [ moore - na - odd ] ) and ( [ moore - na - even ] ) , @xmath60 is smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "thus , @xmath127 . the same reasoning applies for the case @xmath134 in @xmath135 , giving diameter @xmath131 .",
    "in fact if , in this case , we change @xmath136 for @xmath14 we get the diameter @xmath127 for the order @xmath137 .",
    "this is the lower missing value in @xmath132 to cover all the range @xmath138 with the minimum possible diameter .",
    "@xmath139 when @xmath128 , we have the tiles centered at @xmath32 or at @xmath140 of fig .",
    "[ fig - na - n=52-k=3 ] , which gives diameter @xmath129 , and their corresponding tessellations .",
    "moreover , the distribution of the @xmath32 s yields the equations with solutions @xmath121 and @xmath122 , as claimed ( see morillo , fiol , and fbrega @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath135 although , according to ( [ moore - na - odd ] ) and ( [ moore - na - even ] ) , for the range @xmath142 the minimum theoretical diameter is @xmath129 , a detailed study of the corresponding tiles and tessellations show that this is not attainable and , then , @xmath131 ( a value guarantied again by theorems [ bermond - theo ] and [ basic - theo ] ) .    note that the only missing value in the above interval is @xmath143 . in this case",
    ", computer programming shows that , to obtain the minimum diameter @xmath129 , we need to use other steps different from @xmath121 and @xmath122 . in terms of the diameter @xmath144 of the new amsterdam digraph",
    ", we have the following results :    * for every odd diameter @xmath145 , there is a new amsterdam digraph for any order @xmath146 satisfying @xmath147 to be compared with the theoretical optimal values which , according to the moore bounds ( [ moore - na - odd ] ) and ( [ moore - na - even ] ) , would be @xmath148 * for every even diameter @xmath149 , there is a new amsterdam digraph for any order @xmath146 satisfying @xmath150 to be compared with the theoretical optimal values which , according to ( [ moore - na - odd ] ) and ( [ moore - na - even ] ) , would be @xmath151    notice that , according to the upper bound in ( [ resultsna - odd ] ) , the value @xmath152 for odd diameter @xmath127 solves the @xmath1 problem ( see also morillo , fiol and fbrega  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath153 the new amsterdam digraph @xmath154 is a bipartite moore digraph with degree @xmath155 and diameter @xmath156 .",
    "that is , its order attains the moore bound for a ( general ) bipartite digraph with such parameters .      from the above new amsterdam digraphs",
    ", we also can solve the @xmath0 problem for the manhattan digraphs .",
    "the results are based on the already mentioned fact that , if @xmath69 is a new amsterdam digraph on @xmath124 vertices and diameter @xmath14 , then its line digraph @xmath114 is a manhattan digraph on @xmath96 vertices and diameter @xmath157 .",
