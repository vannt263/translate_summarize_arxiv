    "implementation delays occur naturally in decision - making problems .",
    "many corporations face regulatory delays , which need to be taken into account when the corporations make decisions under uncertainty .",
    "a decision made will be carried out only after certain amount of time elapses , for example , due to regulatory reasons .",
    "the decision involves optimally exercising a _ real option _ or optimally manipulating ( with some associated cost ) a state variable , which is the source of uncertainty .",
    "several problems that fit into this framework can be found in the literature : the work of bar - ilan and strange @xcite constitutes the first study considering how delays affect rational investment behavior .",
    "keppo and peura @xcite consider the decision making problem a bank has to solve when it is faced with a minimum capital requirement , a random income , and delayed ( and costly ) recapitalization .",
    "the bank s problem is to determine when to raise capital from its shareholders and the amount to be raised , given that this transaction requires a heavy preparatory work , which causes delay .",
    "bar - ilan and strange @xcite consider ( irreversible ) sequential ( 2 stage ) investment decision problems given two sources of delay : one due to market analysis in the first stage and the other due to construction of a production facility in the second stage . in each stage",
    "the firm s problem is to decide whether to continue entering into the market ( of that product ) or to abandon it .",
    "see also subramanian and jarrow @xcite who consider the problem of a trader ( who is not a _ price taker _ ) who wants to liquidate her position and encounters execution delays in an illiquid market .",
    "alvarez and keppo @xcite study the impact of delivery lags on irreversible investment demand under revenue uncertainty .",
    "ksendal et .",
    "@xcite , @xcite consider the classical stochastic control of stochastic delays systems .",
    "the problem of finding an optimal decision ( in the presence of delays ) can be characterized as a stochastic impulse control problem or an optimal stopping problem . in the papers cited above the impulse control problem or the optimal stopping problem",
    "were solved by using a system of quasi - variational inequalities .",
    "( see e.g. bensoussan and lions @xcite and ksendal and sulem @xcite for the relationship between control problems and quasi - variational inequalities . ) in a different approach , ksendal and sulem @xcite solve a version of delay problems , in which the controller decides on the magnitude of control at the time of decision - making before any delay ( the decision is implemented after some delay ) .",
    "they convert the optimal impulse control problem with delayed reaction into a no - delay optimal stopping / impulse control problem .",
    "note that choosing the control in this way introduces strong path dependence of the controlled process .    here , we solve the impulse control problems with delays _ directly _ and the magnitude of the impulses are chosen at the time of action , not at the time of decision - making , by providing a new characterization of the _ value function_. the controlled process is a non - markov process in this case , too , since depending on when a point in the state space is reached , it has different roles .",
    "but the controlled process in this case regenerates after a decision is implemented , and the value of the state process during the delay time depends on the past only through the value of the state process at the time of decision - making .",
    "we will only consider the threshold and band policies in this paper , since we expect that the non - markovian structure will make finding the optimal solution much more difficult if we allow more general strategies .",
    "for example , because of the lack of strong markov property , we were unable to prove the concavity properties of the value function when the admissible strategies were a superset of band or threshold strategies .",
    "our results rely on the works of dynkin @xcite , @xcite ( see e.g. theorem 16.4 ) and dayanik and karatzas @xcite , who give a general characterization of optimal stopping times of one dimensional diffusions , and on the work of dayanik and egami @xcite , who characterize the value function of stochastic impulse control problems .",
    "our method is direct , in the sense that we do not have to guess the form of the solution and we do not have to prove that the conjectured solution satisfies conditions of a verification lemma as all the methods in the above literature do .",
    "other works similar in vein to ours that provide different characterizations of the value function of impulse / singular control problems for one dimensional diffusions rather than solving variational inequalities are alvarez @xcite , @xcite ; alvarez and virtanen @xcite ; and weerasighe @xcite .",
    "we give a geometric characterization of the value function , specifically , we find very general conditions on the reward function and the coefficients of the underlying diffusion under which the value function can be linearized ( in the continuation region ) after a suitable transformation",
    ". then the problem of determining the value function is equivalent to determining the slope ( if admissible strategies are threshold strategies ) , the slope and the intercept ( if admissible strategies are band strategies ) from first order conditions . to show the efficacy of our methodology we apply it to an optimization problem of a central bank that needs to carry out exchange rate intervention ( this is the krugman model of interest rates considered , among others , in mundaca and ksendal @xcite ) when",
    "there is delay in the implementation of its decisions .",
    "also , using our methodology we will find optimal hiring and firing decisions of a firm that faces stochastic demand and has to conform to regulatory delays .",
    "other works that deal with labor optimization problems are bentolila and bertola @xcite , and shepp and shiryaev @xcite who model firing and hiring decisions as singular controls .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that an impulse control study when the underlying process is a superposition of a brownian motion and a compound poisson process ( when the jumps are of phase type ) is given by @xcite with management of foreign exchange reserves and labor optimization in mind .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we give a characterization of general threshold strategies with implementation delays and provide an easily implemented algorithm to find the value function and the optimal control . to illustrate our methodology",
    ", we will solve a delayed version of an example from mundaca and ksendal @xcite ( also see ksendal @xcite ) .",
    "a similar problem to the one we consider was solved in @xcite in which the controller decides on the magnitude of control at the time of decision - making before any delay . in section 3",
    ", we work with a band policy . in this section",
    "we work on the specific example of optimal hiring and firing decisions rather than providing a general characterization for the value function .",
    "we again provide an easily implemented algorithm to find the optimal control .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "once the system gets intervened , the point moves from @xmath27 to @xmath28 with associated reward and cost .",

    ", we will use the hints of markovian features to find the optimal _ threshold strategy _ ( see assumption  [ ass : first - assump ] ) .",

    "but the implementation of this decision is subject to a delay of @xmath58 units of time .",
    "note that @xmath59 might be less than @xmath60 .",
    "in that case the impulse applied increases the value of the process .",

    "we will also consider a general characterization of the value function and the optimal controls when the decision delay is not a constant but it depends on the magnitude of the action taken as in @xcite or it depends on the value of the state variable that is controlled as in @xcite .",
