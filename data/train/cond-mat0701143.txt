    "lanthanum cuprate , la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , the parent compound of the high - temperature superconductors , is a layered weakly orthorhombic antiferromagnet ( af ) , with a nel temperature , @xmath5 , of approximately 325 k.@xcite the orthorhombic distortion is associated with a small tilt of oxygen octahedra around each copper ion , which also introduces the antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) superexchange interaction between neighboring spins . because of the dm interaction , each cuo@xmath0 plane acquires a small ferromagnetic moment along the @xmath6-axis , perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the direction of the ferromagnetic moments alternates in adjacent planes , and , therefore , there is no net ferromagnetic moment in the crystal .",
    "the dm interaction , though small , has a strong impact on the magnetic properties of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "it was established that a magnetic field perpendicular to the cuo@xmath0 plane causes a first order weak - ferromagnetic transition ( wft).@xcite the critical field , @xmath7 , of the transition depends on the dm coupling as well as on the interlayer exchange . in a non - stoichiometric sample ( @xmath8 k ) , studied in ref . , the critical field at low temperatures was @xmath9 t. in ref .",
    "the value @xmath10 t was obtained from raman spectrum measurements for a crystal with @xmath11 k , while in a recent paper@xcite a significantly larger transition field of 11.5 t was found from neutron diffraction studies for a sample with @xmath12 k.    another manifestation of the dm interaction in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is the phase diagram in an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the antiferomagnetic staggered moment in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is directed along the diagonal of the cuo plaquette ( @xmath13-axis ) , the in - plane anisotropy being generated by the dm interaction .",
    "a theory @xcite based on the mean - field version of the hamiltonian , which includes exchange and dm coupling between cu spins , as well as an out - of - plane anisotropy term , predicts that in a field along the @xmath13-axis one should observe two phase transitions : a spin - flop transition , at which the staggered moment jumps from the ( b , c ) plane into the ( b , a ) plane ( * a * is perpendicular to * b * and * c * ) at a field @xmath14 , determined by the dm coupling energy , and a second transition at a higher field , when the staggered moment rotates into the @xmath6-direction .",
    "such a phase diagram was indeed observed in ref . .",

    "@xcite used raman spectroscopy measurements to study the influence of a magnetic field on the in - plane spin - wave ( sw ) gap in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "they showed that the gap abruptly increases at the wft , decreases with the increase of the field directed along the @xmath13- axis and increases with the field pointing along the @xmath15-axis .",
    "the observed field dependence of the gaps was described by classical theories@xcite based on the model , which include anisotropic symmetric and antisymmetric intralayer coupling between the cu spins as well as interlayer exchange .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that quantum corrections are very important when considering the properties of layered cuprates , with spin @xmath16.@xcite intensive calculations were performed for an isotropic heisenberg two dimensional model with nearest neighbor interactions.@xcite perturbative expansions in @xmath2 , series expansions , and monte carlo methods were used to go beyond the linear sw theory.@xcite it appears that the renormalization factors obtained from the nonlinear sw ( nlsw ) theory to leading order in @xmath2 are sufficiently close to those which follow from more complicated calculations even for spin @xmath16 .",
    "the quantum effects renormalize significantly the mean value of the spin at @xmath17 , the sw stiffness , the in - plane and out - of - plane sw gaps at zero magnetic field , etc . in a recent paper,@xcite",
    "the @xmath2 nlsw theory was employed to calculate the effect of quantum fluctuations on the sw stiffness and other parameters of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , in a model which takes into account the plaquette ring exchange .",
    "the renormalization factors which follow from these calculations and the fit of the experimental results by coldea _ et al._,@xcite appeared to be somewhat closer to unity than in the model with nearest - neighbor exchange only . in view of these results",
    "one should expect that quantum fluctuations are important also for the quantitative understanding of the sw spectrum behavior in a magnetic field .",
    "in this paper we use the nlsw theory to leading order in @xmath2 to calculate the influence of quantum fluctuations on the magnetic field dependence of the in - plane and out - of - plane sw gaps in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "we show that the quantum fluctuations alter the expression for the critical field of the wft , renormalize all physical quantities , which enter in the equations for the gaps in a magnetic field , and change therefore significantly the values of the spin - spin couplings extracted from the experiment .",
    "the theoretical results are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "the theory also predicts a non - trivial effect of the magnetic field on the sw propagating in the @xmath6-direction .",
