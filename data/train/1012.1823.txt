    "standard electronic structure calculations , based on the local spin density approximation ( lsda)@xcite to density functional theory , work very well for conventional materials like simple metals and their alloys , characterized by delocalized electron states and large band formation energies",

    "consequently , different assumptions and/or parameters need to be invoked to describe the electronic structure of strongly correlated electron materials.@xcite    the self - interaction corrected@xcite local - spin - density ( sic - lsd ) energy functional is free of the si error and fulfils the requirement of being parameter free and of sufficient accuracy to study trends in properties of entire families of materials containing both localized and itinerant electrons.@xcite here we apply the sic - lsd to provide global understanding of the ground state electronic structure of rare earth monopnictides and monochalcogenides and , through that , also demonstrate the predictive power and accuracy of this approach .",
    "specifically , the present study covers 140 distinct compounds , rx , with r referring to the rare earth atoms ce , pr , nd , pm , sm , eu , gd , tb , dy , ho , er , tm , yb , lu , and x standing for the pnictide atoms n , p , as , sb , bi and the chalcogenide atoms o , s , se , te , po . most of these compounds are known to exist in nature , crystallizing predominantly in the rocksalt structure . due to the intricate dual nature of the 4@xmath1-electrons , as a function of chemical environment these compounds display an extraordinarily wide range of electronic , magnetic , optical , and magneto - optical properties with , among other things , potential practical applications in the field of spintronics.@xcite a considerable number of theoretical studies on the rx compounds have resulted in greatly improved insight into their properties.@xcite however those calculations have often been guided by experiment , relying on parameters to reproduce the observed properties .",
    "the goal of the present systematic study is to establish a paramater - free unified theoretical picture of the rx electronic properties and possibly provide directions for further experimental investigations . with future applications in mind , we show how large scale computational infrastructures can potentially be exploited in the search for the novel rare earth related materials that play an increasingly prominent role in innovative technologies and the quest for renewable energies.@xcite",

    "the calculated lattice parameters for the rare earth sulphides and the ytterbium pnictides and chalcogenides are compared to their experimental counterparts in respectively figs . [ alatall]a and [ alatall]b .",
    "the agreement is good , reproducing the sudden increase in lattice parameter at sms , eus and ybs , due to the increased @xmath1-electron localization .",
    "we have observed that quite systematically the calculated lattice parameters for the divalent and trivalent scenarios of a given compound differ by about 5 % .",
    "therefore , a comparison to the experimental lattice parameters is expected to provide a good indication as to whether the calculations predict the correct ground state and valency configuration .",

    "[ alat ] , the experimental equilibrium lattice parameters for all the rare earth monopnictides and monochalcogenides@xcite are plotted along the x - axis , whilst our calculated equilibrium counterparts are plotted along the y - axis . in this representation ,",
    "the proximity of the data points to the @xmath80 line is a measure of the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "we find that for the large majority of the compounds the calculated equilibrium lattice parameters lie within @xmath01.5% of the experimental values , i.e. well below the 5% that would indicate a wrongly predicted ground state configuration .",
    "the only exceptions are cen , dyte , and three of the polonide compounds . with respect to the latter compounds",
    ", polonium is difficult to handle , and it is unclear to what degree the experimental results refer to stoichiometric samples.@xcite    it is well established from rare earth halide data@xcite as well as xps measurements on the rare earth elements@xcite that the divalent configuration becomes more competitive in dy compounds due to the 3/4 filling of the @xmath1-shell .",
    "the inclusion of the te leads to a considerable reduction of @xmath67 for dyx compounds , as can be seen on the example of dyse in fig .",
    "[ xse]b , and quite generally gives rise to the negative dip around dy in fig .",
    "[ total]b .",
    "this trend reproduces overall very well the experimentally observed data,@xcite however we wrongly predict a dy@xmath81 ground state in dyte .",
    "this seems to indicate that in some cases we tend to overestimate the tetrad effect s influence as a result of approximating the respective slater integrals by the fully localized atomic limit instead of considering also corrections due to the solid state environment ( screening / hybridization ) . for cen",
    ", the experimental lattice parameter seems to suggest a tetravalent ground state,@xcite whereas our calculations predict the trivalent configuration to be marginally more favourable than the tetravalent configuration by @xmath03 mry , which on the other hand could be indicative of an intermediate valency scenario implied by experiments.@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ alat ] , the wrongly predicted ground state of dyte shows up as noticeably off diagonal data point , but at the same time it also highlights the excellent agreement obtained for all the other cases investigated with the present approach .",
    "thus , the sic - lsd methodology is capable of predicting , with considerable accuracy , the ground state valency and lattice parameter of the rare earth monochalcogenides and monopnictides , and the associated ground state electronic structures can be expected to make valid predictions concerning the other physical properties of these materials .      .",
    "the colour scheme is as follows : metals are marked in blue tones , with light blue for semimetals .",
    "semiconductors are in black , whilst yellow to red is assigned to increasingly heavy fermion - like systems .",
    "the fields marked with `` iv '' indicate intermediate behaviour between two different valency configurations .",
    "[ alat1 ] , width=680 ]    here we concentrate on establishing global trends in the ground state electronic structure which we base on the calculated dos at the fermi energy , e@xmath82 , as providing a guideline for predicting materials with specific properties when we systematically scan the full manifold of rare earth compounds .",
    "the corresponding results are summarized in the form of an `` electronic phase diagram '' presented in fig .",
    "[ alat1 ] , where based on the calculated dos we distinguish between semiconductors , semi - metals , metals , and heavy fermion - like compounds .",
    "looking at the phase diagram , we see that our calculations predict a considerable number of compounds to be semiconductors . in particular , with respect to the pnictides , ndn , pmn and the majority of the rare earth nitrides from gdn onwards are found to be small gap semiconductors , with energy band gaps ranging from 0.06 ev in ndn to 0.6 ev in hon .",
    "few conclusive conductivity measurements for the nitrides exist , and it is for example still not fully established whether gdn is semiconducting@xcite or semi - metallic.@xcite our calculations predict gdn to be a semiconductor , although in an earlier sic - lsd calculation , where spin - orbit coupling was not taken into account , a half - metallic ground state was observed instead.@xcite all the divalent monochalcogenides turn out to be semiconductors , in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the divalent character implies that in the chalcogenide semiconductors the energy gap is brought about by localizing an additional @xmath1-electron , as depicted through the transition from ( f ) to ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ schem ] , in variance to the energy gap observed in the trivalent nitride semiconductors , resulting from the filling of the unoccupied anion @xmath68-states , as represented by scenario ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ schem ] . in the sic - lsd",
    "the occupied 4@xmath1-levels tend to be situated at too low energies,@xcite as this ground state methodology can not reproduce the spectroscopy of an eventual experimentally observed mid - gap @xmath1-level . for euo , eus , and ybs ,",
    "the calculations overestimate the energy gaps by a factor 2.@xcite    the dominant part of the electronic phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ alat1 ] consists of metallic compounds .",
    "the indicated differences in conductivities can be straightforwardly related to the trends in electronic structure observed when moving along the diagonals in fig [ schem ] . in the pnictides ,",
    "the closing of the semiconducting gap due to the onset of pnictogen @xmath68 - rare earth @xmath83 overlap gives at first rise to a vanishingly small dos , resulting in the semi - metals cex to prx and gdx to dyx ( light blue areas ) .",
    "as the overlap gradually increases ( due to decreasing electronegativity and/or increasing lanthanide contraction ) , the behaviour becomes fully metallic ( dark blue areas ) , and eventually in the `` late '' rare earths , with more and more of the @xmath1-states getting occupied , heavy fermion - like behaviour sets in ( yellow - red areas ) .",
    "the rare earth chalcogenides display less variety in terms of metallic behaviour . here",
    "we start out with a partially occupied conduction band , and semi - metallic behaviour is not observed . instead , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ alat1 ] , the rare earth systems , cex to pmx , and gdx to erx ( apart from the polonides and a couple of tellurides ) are metallic . compared to the pnictides , in the late rare earth chalcogenides , the @xmath1-states start filling even before they have moved far enough towards lower binding energies to achieve significant hybridization . instead of forming a heavy metal , a relatively pure @xmath1-state pins the fermi level ( scenarios ( e ) and ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ schem ] ) and the divalent semiconducting scenario ( scenario ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ schem ] ) correspondingly becomes energetically more favourable .",
    "the agreement between observed and predicted properties is overall very good , except maybe for the calculated heavy fermion pnictides .",
    "thus the `` late '' rare earths , smx , and ybx , are described as low carrier semi - metallic compounds , seemingly at odds with the large dos at the fermi level that is predicted in the sic - lsd calculations .",
    "the experimentally observed large specific heat coefficient in these systems has been interpreted as heavy fermion behaviour by some authors,@xcite whilst others have explained it in terms of the kondo effect.@xcite since our calculations are based on the effective one electron picture , they can not adequately describe the many - body physics of these compounds .",
    "however the large peak at the fermi level that is calculated in the trivalent configuration indicates strong @xmath84-mixing , i.e. a prerequiste for the hybridization between the narrow @xmath1-peak and the sea of conduction electrons that underpins the kondo effect .",
    "eusb , ybbi , eubi ( as well as euas ) do not actually crystallize in the nacl structure investigated here,@xcite i.e. , the very same pnictides that we find to be divalent or close to divalent do not occur in nature . as indicated schematically in fig .",
    "[ schem ] , for the pnictides , localization of an additional @xmath1-electron ( ( c ) @xmath79 ( c ) transition ) implies the removal of some bonding @xmath68-states .",
    "this , however , would destabilize the underlying nacl crystal structure and , as a result of this competition between band formation and correlations , it seems that these materials prefer to distort and crystallize in a different structure altogether .    in fig .",
    "[ alat1 ] the compounds marked as `` intermediate valent '' ( iv ) are those where the calculations find close to degenerate energy configurations , meaning either @xmath55 or @xmath55 is smaller than 5 mry .",
    "given the dual nature of the @xmath1-electrons , it is to be expected that these materials are highly sensitive to environmental changes such as pressure@xcite or doping . in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ etot ] they correspond to the trivalent - divalent degenerate compounds in and around the white area , and to cen , the only compound that is at the borderline of the tetravalent - trivalent degeneracy .",
    "for the tm chalcogenides , it emerges from xps measurements that tms is metallic trivalent , tmse is intermediate valent , and tmte is semiconducting divalent.@xcite this , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ alat1 ] , exactly matches the valency sequence that we have derived from the sic - lsd calculations . for sms",
    "we find @xmath55 = -5.6 ev , indicating a divalent semiconductor , but given the small energy difference , susceptible to undergo a localization - delocalization transition under pressure,@xcite as has been observed experimentally.@xcite apart from euo , the rare earth monoxides do not appear to occur naturally , but a number of them have been synthesized under high pressure , where it has emerged that euo and ybo are divalent semiconductors , ceo , pro and ndo are trivalent metals , whilst smo is a metal with the sm in an intermediate valent state.@xcite these findings , including the intermediate valent nature of smo , are again in excellent agreement with our predictions .    in summary , this effective one - electron sic - lsd methodology accurately predicts the phase transitions associated with the @xmath1-electron localization / delocalization .",
    "however , we should note here that because of the many - body effects , beyond those included in the sic exchange - correlation energy functional , the representation of the calculated densities of states in terms of the described above phase diagram is most likely not the full picture of the underlying electronic structure .",
    "this is in particlular true in the iv and heavy fermion areas of the phase diagram , where those left out many - body interactions will introduce additional refinements into the physical trends based on sic - lsd .",
    "therefore , compounds that are situated in those areas provide the greater challenge and should be further investigated by methodologies such as the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite or gw.@xcite",
    "we have shown that the orbital dependent dft approach , based on the lsd energy functional , appended by two important corrections , namely the self - interaction correction and the tetrad effect , can provide a global picture of the electronic structure of the rare earth monopnictides and monochalcogenides , expressed through the uncovered trends in their behaviour .",
    "we believe that this sic - lsd based study provides an important understanding of the physical properties of these compounds .",
    "although for a given compound the dmft+lda or gw approaches can give added insight into the details of the electronic structure , they can not at the present time be employed for large scale predictive studies given that they either depend on parameters and/or are very time consuming .",
    "our study has given rise to a unified picture of the ground state valency and valency transitions across the entire range of rare earth monopnictides and monochalcogenides , starting from tetravalency , through trivalency to divalency , as one moves from the early to late rare earths , in correlation with the ligands .",
    "we have also discovered the important links between the underlying electronic structure , valency and physical properties of these compounds , ranging from semiconducting to semi - metallic , metallic and even heavy - fermion - like behaviour .",
    "the present study has also established that if the energy differences between the energetically relevant valency scenarios are small , then fluctuations will play an important role , giving rise to intermediate ground states .",
    "this effect can be described within the sic - lsd formalism by mapping the valence ( and also spin ) fluctuations on to disorder in the spirit of the hubbard iii approach,@xcite which we intend to apply in future to the `` intermediate '' compounds identified in the present study .",
    "this work made use of computational resources at the danish center for scientific computing ( dcsc ) and nw - grid computers , the latter jointly provided by daresbury laboratory and the universities of lancaster , liverpool and manchester with funding from the north west development agency .",
