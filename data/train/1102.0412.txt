    "* ) . as a result ,",
    "the clustered mode of star formation plays a fundamental role in understanding star formation in general . in the galaxy ,",
    "stars within a cluster can often be individually resolved , and thus detailed studies of the resolved structure and interplay between stars are possible .",
    "however , our galaxy only presents a narrow range of environmental conditions , and we are compelled to study more distant objects in order to investigate the impact of different environments on star cluster formation .",
    "in relatively nearby starburst galaxies ( @xmath7  mpc ) , recent star formation activity has typically been resolved in massive star clusters .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) was instrumental in the discovery of the so - called `` super star clusters '' ( sscs ) , which have been detected in significant numbers ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "large samples of less massive clusters have also been detected , typically following a power - law distribution down to the completeness limits of the data . however , despite the large samples of high quality optical data , the impact of the local environment on massive star cluster formation is far from understood .",
    "one of the primary obstacles has been the very nature of star formation , which is obscured at optical wavelengths . once clusters have emerged from their birth material to be observable in optical light ,",
    "their birth environments can no longer directly be probed .",
    "to study the dependence of environment on star formation , it is necessary to penetrate through the optically thick cocoon before the system has had time to evolve and disperse its gas and dust , which @xcite have estimated to last @xmath215% of the lifetimes of the embedded cluster s stars . to find evidence of natal clusters of massive stars , observations at wavelengths @xmath8  a  few  @xmath9 m are necessary .",
    "high spatial resolution radio observations at centimeter wavelengths are a powerful way to identify the earliest phases of star - formation regions via their  inverted \" spectral indices @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; this type of spectral energy distribution is similar to that of hii regions , which exist on a smaller scale around individual massive stars in our galaxy , i.e. , ultracompact hii regions @xcite . if the larger ultra - dense hii regions ( udhiis ) associated with natal clusters of massive stars emit sufficient thermal bremsstrahlung radiation , we can detect the signature of this radiation by its radio signature .",
    "high spatial resolution radio observations have revealed a sample of very young massive star clusters still embedded in their birth material in a number of galaxies , including : ngc  5253 @xcite , he  2 - 10 @xcite , ngc  2146 @xcite , ngc  4214 @xcite , haro  3 @xcite , ngc  4449 @xcite , and sbs  0335 - 052 @xcite .",
    "these heavily enshrouded clusters contain hundreds to thousands of young massive stars ; these nascent stars create compact hii regions within the dense environment and manifest themselves as optically thick free - free radio sources , some of which have been confirmed as luminous mid - infrared sources @xcite .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , the most massive and luminous natal clusters were the first to be identified in nearby galaxies ( as in the sample cited above ) .",
    "however , if star cluster formation tends to follow a power - law , as suggested by optical studies @xcite , we should expect to find a continuum of extragalactic star clusters ranging from objects similar to individual galactic uchii regions to the massive proto - globular clusters common in starburst galaxies .",
    "furthermore , current theory suggests that the properties of massive star clusters will largely be dependent on the pressure of their formation environment @xcite .",
    "therefore , the most vigorous starbursts host the most massive star clusters , while relatively quiescent galaxies ( like our own milky way ) will tend to contain only low mass clusters and associations . if we wish to understand how massive star cluster formation depends on the local environmental properties as well as to understand it in a statistical sense , we must fill in the continuum between galactic uchiis and natal sscs with the aim of building a large sample . for this purpose ,",
    "the observations presented here are part of an effort to increase the known sample of natal clusters in relatively nearby galaxies .",
    "we use the nrao very large array ( vla ) and the atnf australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to image 25 galaxies selected for their likelihood of containing natal star formation .",
    "this sample includes 25 galaxies that were selected for this study based on their distance and their likelihood of containing natal star formation . indicators of possible natal star formation included either ( 1 ) membership in the markarian uv catalog , the arp catalog of irregular and tidally interacting galaxies , or the vv catalog of interacting galaxies ( 18 out of the 25 galaxies ) , or ( 2 ) evidence of wolf - rayet ( w - r ) features in the host galaxy s spectra ( 10 out of the 25 galaxies ) , necessitating the presence of young massive stars , or ( 3 ) identification of the galaxy as a blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) , again an indicator of recent star formation ( 6 out of the 25 galaxies ) .",
    "several of the galaxies in this sample fall into more than one of these three categories . due to sensitivity and spatial resolution limitations ,",
    "only galaxies within @xmath220  mpc were included .",
    "we give a brief overview of the selected galaxies in ",
    "[ vla_gals]-[atca_gals ] , and their characteristics are summarized in table  [ galaxycharstable ] .",
    "we observed the eight southern hemisphere galaxies in our sample on 2002 march in 3  cm ( 8.6  ghz ) and 6  cm ( 4.8  ghz ) bands with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in the 6a configuration . with the very large array ( vla ) , we observed the 19 northern hemisphere galaxies on 2002 february 15 and 2002 october 21 using the a - configuration for 3.6  cm ( 8.5  ghz ) and the c - configuration for 1.3  cm ( 22  ghz ) observations .",
    "for the atca data , we excluded visibilities with @xmath13 values @xmath14",
    "k@xmath15 in the 6  cm band to better match the largest spatial scale to which the 3  cm observations are sensitive .",
    "we then imaged the atca 3  cm data with a robustness parameter of 3.0 ( close to natural weighting ) , which helped to mitigate noise levels in that band , and imaged the 6  cm data with a robustness of 0.0 to add more weight to longer baselines , thereby increasing the spatial resolution of the resulting images .",
    "finally , we matched the convolution kernel of the atca 3  cm images to that of the 6  cm images during the imaging process .",
    "we followed a similar procedure to create images of the vla data . since the vla was in the a - configuration for the 3.6  cm observations , the resulting images have higher spatial resolution than images made with 1.3  cm observations in the c - configuration .",
    "consequently , we imaged the 1.3  cm data with a robustness parameter of 3.0 and excluded all visibilities @xmath16  k@xmath15 in the _ uv _  plane .",
    "this process approximately matches the largest spatial scale to which the data are sensitive .",
    "the 3.6  cm data were imaged with a robustness parameter of 0.0 in order to obtain slightly higher angular resolution than with natural weighting .",
    "we created images of all atca and vla data with the imagr task of the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the parameters for the imaging process are summarized in table  [ sourcetable ] , and the resulting radio contours for galaxies with detected emission are shown overlaid on optical or infrared images in figures  1 to 9 .",
    "the nature of a radio source can be constrained using its spectral index @xmath10 , where @xmath17 .",
    "supernova remnants typically have radio spectral indices of @xmath18 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thermal sources ( e.g. hii regions ) can be identified by their signature thermal bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "purely optically thin thermal emission has @xmath19 , while in the optically thick limit the emission has @xmath20 .",
    "the specific spectral morphology of an hii region at radio frequencies is due to a combination of size and density structure .",
    "the frequency at which thermal emission transitions from optically thick ( @xmath20 ) to thin ( @xmath21 ) is higher for denser hii regions .    in order to compute a spectral index @xmath22 based on two flux densities @xmath23 and frequencies @xmath24 , it is important to match the spatial scales to which the different frequencies are sensitive in so far as possible . given the nature of interferometers , it is virtually impossible to match the synthesized beams precisely , but steps can be taken to improve the extent to which the synthesized beams are compatible . to this end , when imaging the radio observations presented in this paper , we limited the @xmath13 coverage of each data set , we varied the weighting of longer and shorter baselines , and finally we convolved the frequencies to the same synthesized beam .",
    "( this final step does not compensate for any missing @xmath13 coverage ; however , it is important to match the point response function . )    for the purposes of this paper , we consider a source to be dominated by thermal emission if it has a spectral index that is consistent with @xmath25 within @xmath26 uncertainty ( table  [ derivedproperties ] ) .",
    "likewise , we consider a source to be dominated by non - thermal emission if it has a spectral index that is consistent with @xmath27 given @xmath26 uncertainty .",
    "however , in many cases it is not possible to determine unambiguously whether a source is thermal , non - thermal , or a combination thereof for two main reasons : ( 1 ) several of the sources presented here are clearly extended and likely contain multiple components , and ( 2 ) the spectral indices have significant uncertainties , and many sources that nominally appear thermal could also be consistent ( within uncertainty ) with being non - thermal and _ vice versa _ ; we classify these sources as `` ambiguous . ''",
    "of the 25 galaxies in this study , only five have radio sources that are dominated by thermal emission , four have sources that are dominated by non - thermal emission , six have radio sources that are ambiguous within the uncertainty limits , and sixteen have no detected radio sources ( figures  1 to 9 ; tables  3 and 4 ) .",
    "to measure the flux densities , we used the aips++ viewer program to create identical polygonal apertures around each of our sources at 3 and 6  cm for the atca data and at 1.3 and 3.6  cm for the vla data . by using identical convolution kernels and apertures , we are able to maximize the accuracy of the relative photometry .",
    "errors in the flux densities were determined by adding in quadrature the uncertainties due to the absolute flux calibration , variation from the sky background , and changes in the size and shape of the aperture . for the purposes of determining the uncertainties in the spectral index @xmath10 , the final term in the uncertainty due to variation in aperture is neglected as identical apertures are used at both frequencies .",
    "see tables  [ fluxtable_vla ] and [ fluxtable_atca ] for integrated and peak flux densities as well as spectral indices of each source .",
    "massive , short - lived stars drive the thermal free - free emission we observe at radio wavelengths ; hence , an understanding of the photo - ionization rate for each of our candidate udhii regions enables us to predict the number of massive stars in a cluster .",
    "lyman continuum photons ionize these hii regions ; thus , with knowledge of the radio luminosities , we can predict a lower bound on the lyman continuum flux @xcite , @xmath28    a number of possible issues must be kept in mind when interpreting the @xmath29 values and radio flux densities .",
    "first , the application of this equation assumes the emission is purely thermal and optically thin .",
    "contamination from non - thermal emission within the synthesized beams is also a possible issue at the spatial resolutions used here , and would inflate the resulting @xmath29 values . to partially mitigate these issues ,",
    "it is advantageous to use flux densities obtained at the highest radio frequency available for two reasons : ( 1 ) the higher frequency emission suffers from less self - absorption and is therefore more likely to be optically thin , and ( 2 ) the higher the frequency , the less likely it is to contain a significant amount of non - thermal contaminating flux .",
    "second , an electron temperature must also be assumed , and we adopt a `` typical '' hii region temperature of @xmath30  k ; the uncertainty in @xmath29 due to this assumption is @xmath31% .",
    "finally , the actual @xmath29 values could be higher than observed if a significant fraction of the ionization radiation is either absorbed by dust within the hii region or suffers from significant leakage through a porous ism .",
    "thus , when these conditions are met , the @xmath29 values quoted here should be interpreted as lower limits .",
    "the inferred values for @xmath29 of each of the identified thermal sources are shown in table  [ derivedproperties ] . assuming each of these thermal sources contains an embedded star cluster",
    ", we also estimate the number of o7.5  v stars , each having a lyman continuum flux @xmath32  s@xmath33 @xcite , required to produce the observed free - free , thermal radio flux ( see table  [ derivedproperties ] ) .",
    "we used the stellar synthesis code starburst99 @xcite in combination with @xmath29 to estimate the total stellar masses of the natal clusters .",
    "following @xcite , we assume each cluster has a metallicity @xmath34 and a salpeter imf from 1 to 100  m@xmath35 . assuming the @xmath29 values scale directly with the cluster mass and that the clusters are @xmath36  myr old , we infer stellar masses for the radio detected star - forming regions ranging between @xmath37  m@xmath35 and @xmath38  m@xmath35 ( see table  [ derivedproperties ] ) .",
    "the most massive of these star - forming regions also appear to be slightly spatially extended at the resolution of these observations and likely include a number of star clusters that are not resolved .      in order to determine the sizes of the detected sources in table  [ derivedproperties ] , we initially fit a gaussian profile to each source ,",
    "from which the synthesized beam was deconvolved in order to estimate the actual source sizes .",
    "the major limitation of this method is that it requires the source to be roughly gaussian , which is not true for many sources presented here , some of which appear to have quite complex structure .",
    "nevertheless , this method will , at a minimum , provide information about whether or not a source is extended at the resolution of the observation . using this method",
    ", we infer the physical sizes of the star forming regions based upon the distances in table  [ detectionlimits ] and deconvolved angular sizes in tables  [ fluxtable_vla ] and [ fluxtable_atca ] , with resulting sizes ranging between @xmath39  pc to a few @xmath40  pc .",
    "these sizes are much larger than one would expect for an individual cluster ( a few pc ) ; thus we conclude that most of the radio - detected star - forming regions presented here are likely to be groups of individual clusters , which may well be at slighltly different evolutionary states .",
    "furthermore , these large inferred sizes allow for a complex origin for the observed emission and potential non - thermal contamination ; there is ample room within these large regions for a large number of ultracompact hii regions , evolved hii regions , snr , and other objects .",
    "higher spatial resolution observations are clearly required in order to disentangle the components of the complex sources and facilitate more precise size measurements .      in order to provide a comparison for the relative fluxes of non - thermal and thermal sources",
    ", we calculate the expected flux densities and detection thresholds for the galactic supernova remnant cas  a , an uchii region complex w49a at the distance of the galaxies in this sample .",
    "cas  a is the canonical `` young '' core collapse snr in the galaxy , with the highest luminosity and youngest age of any such remnant in the milky way @xcite .",
    "likewise , w49a is a benchmark star - forming region in the galaxy , with @xmath41 individual thermal radio sources and @xmath42  s@xmath33 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the expected signal - to - noise for analogs to cas  a and w49a in our sample galaxies at 3.6  cm are shown in table  [ detectionlimits ] .",
    "for example , if cas  a would have been a @xmath43 detection in a given galaxy , we would be unlikely to identify an individual supernova remnant .",
    "if w49a would have been a detection @xmath44 in a given galaxy and yet no thermal sources are detected , such a detection limit would suggest no current star formation above this limit in that galaxy .    given our detection limits for objects similar to cas  a and w49a",
    ", there are a few striking non - detections that merit further investigation .",
    "for example , in the galaxy mrk  1479 ( @xmath45  mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cas  a and w49a would have exhibed detections at the level of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively ; yet no radio sources are detected .",
    "the lack of such natal clusters could suggest that the current star formation rate in mrk  1479 is below that of the milky way .",
    "however , the inclusion of mrk  1479 in both the markarian catalog of ultraviolet bright galaxies and vorontsov - velyaminov ( vv ) catalog of interacting galaxies suggests that it must have recently been undergoing vigorous star formation .",
    "thus , the lack of detected thermal radio sources in this case supports the hypothesis that the natal stage of a cluster s evolution is extremely short .",
    "in this radio study of 25 galaxies selected based upon their optical signposts of star formation , we expected to detect a number of thermal radio sources originating from massive nascent star clusters .",
    "however , we only detect definite thermal - dominated radio sources in five of the sample galaxies , with an additional six galaxies hosting radio sources whose origins are ambiguous within uncertainties . using the benchmark galactic star - forming region w49a ,",
    "we put these non - detections in context ; in several galaxies , w49a would have been a @xmath48 detection . for example , mrk  1479 is a notable case of a uv galaxy , included in both the vv and markarian catalogs , with no evidence of thermal radio emission coming from an object similar to w49a at a @xmath49 level . for the five galaxies with detected thermal radio sources , the inferred properties of the nascent clusters range from large ob - associations to moderate super star clusters  extending both above and below the mass of w49a .    one hypothesis to explain",
    "the dearth of natal clusters in this sample is that the timescale a star - forming region spends in a stage that is detectable in radio is extremely brief .",
    "@xcite suggest that sscs may spend as little as @xmath50 to @xmath51  myr in the embedded phase when they are detectable with thermal radio emission .",
    "compared to galaxy evolution timescales , the time interval for star formation is very short .",
    "our results are consistent with this hypothesis , however a more complete statistical sample is needed to better constrain the timescales .",
    "such a larger and complete sample would allow us to compare the number of clusters in different evolutionary stages and track the emergence process .",
    "while this study was intended to identify candidate natal star - forming regions in nearby galaxies , follow - up efforts are imperative .",
    "in particular , this work would benefit from higher spatial resolution observations than those presented here .",
    "such observations will be critical for disentangling thermal and non - thermal sources in close proximity .",
    "in addition , higher frequency radio observations will provide much stronger constraints on the the spectral energy distributions of the thermal radio sources .",
    "in particular , high spatial resolution observations at @xmath52  ghz will be useful for better understanding the relationship between between cluster properties and the local environment in which they are formed .",

    "<S> in order to investigate the relationship between the local environment and the properties of natal star clusters , we obtained radio observations of 25 star - forming galaxies within 20  mpc using the very large array ( vla ) and the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) . </S>",
    "<S> natal star - forming regions can be identified by their characteristic thermal radio emission , which is manifest in their spectral index at centimeter wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the host galaxies in our sample were selected based upon their likelihood of harboring young star formation . in star - forming regions , the ionizing flux of massive embedded stars powers the dominant thermal free - free emission of those sources , resulting in a spectral index of @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 ) , which we compute . with the current sensitivity </S>",
    "<S> , we find that of the 25 galaxies in this sample only five have radio sources with spectral indices that are only consistent with a thermal origin ; four have radio sources that are only consistent with a non - thermal origin ; six have radio sources whose nature is ambiguous due to uncertainties in the spectral index ; and sixteen have no detected radio sources . for those sources that appear to be dominated by thermal emission , we infer the ionizing flux of the star clusters and the number of equivalent o7.5  v stars that are required to produce the observed radio flux densities . </S>",
    "<S> the most radio - luminous clusters that we detect have an equivalent of @xmath2@xmath3  o7.5  v stars , and the smallest only have an equivalent of @xmath2@xmath4  o7.5  v stars ; thus these star - forming regions span the range of large ob - associations to moderate `` super star clusters '' ( sscs ) . with the current detection limits , we also place upper limits on the masses of clusters that could have recently formed ; for a number of galaxies we can conclusively rule out the presence of natal clusters significantly more massive than the galactic star - forming region w49a ( @xmath5  m@xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dearth of current massive cluster formation in these galaxies suggests that either their current star formation intensities have fallen to near or below that of the milky way and/or that the evolutionary state that gives rise to thermal radio emission is short - lived . </S>"
