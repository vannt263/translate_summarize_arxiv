    "very - high - energy ( vhe ) astrophysics is on the verge to enter its golden age .",
    "planned ground - based detectors like cta ( cherenkov telescope array )  ( actis et al .",
    "2011 ) , hawc ( high altitude water cherenkov experiment )  ( sinnis 2005 ) and hiscore ( hundred square - km cosmic origin explorer )  ( tluczykont et al . 2011 ) will probe within the next few years the energy range from @xmath12 up to @xmath13 ( cta and hawc ) and even up to @xmath14 ( hiscore ) with unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "unfortunately , a stumbling block along this exciting avenue is the existence of a soft photon background in the universe which leads to a strong suppression of the observed flux through the @xmath15 pair - production process .",
    "the onset of this process depends both on the observed energy and on the source redshift , as it will become apparent later . specifically , it is mostly due to the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) ",
    "i.e. to the background in the infrared , visible and ultraviolet region  in the energy range @xmath16 , to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in the range @xmath17 and to the radio background ( rb ) in the range @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , even though the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ebl has remained quite uncertain for a long time , a remarkable agreement among the various ebl models has been reached recently , and also the rb has been measured in 2008 with considerably better precision than before .",
    "all this prompts us to carefully evaluate the optical depth  which quantifies the photon absorption due to the above pair - production process  in the energy range @xmath19 for a source redshift up to @xmath20 . as a particular case",
    ", we derive the photon mean free path for @xmath15 as a function of energy in the local universe ( @xmath21 ) in order to compare it with that obtained by coppi and aharonian ( ca ) in 1997  ( coppi & aharonian 1997 ) .",
    "a less detailed but similar result was independently derived at the same time by phrotheroe and biermann  ( phrotheroe & biermann 1997 ) .",
    "we start by recalling that the photon survival probability @xmath22 is currently parameterized as @xmath23 where @xmath1 is the observed energy and @xmath4 is the optical depth that quantifies the dimming of the source at redshift @xmath24 . clearly @xmath25 increases with @xmath24 , since a greater source distance implies a larger probability for a photon to disappear . apart from atmospheric effects , one typically has @xmath10 for @xmath24 not too large , in which case the universe is optically thin all the way out to the source . but",
    "depending on @xmath1 it can happen that @xmath26 , and so at some point the universe becomes optically thick along the line of sight to the source .",
    "the value @xmath27 such that @xmath28 defines the @xmath2-_ray horizon _ for a given @xmath1 , and sources beyond the horizon ( namely with @xmath29 ) tend to become progressively invisible as @xmath24 further increases past @xmath27 .",
    "whenever dust effects can be neglected , photon depletion arises solely when hard photons of energy @xmath30 scatter off soft background photons of energy @xmath31 permeating the universe , which gives rise to hard photon absorption .",
    "let us proceed to quantify this issue .",
    "regarding @xmath30 as an independent variable , the process is kinematically allowed for @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the scattering angle and @xmath34 is the electron mass . note that @xmath30 and @xmath31 change along the line of sight in proportion of @xmath35 because of the cosmic expansion .",
    "the corresponding breit - wheeler cross - section is  ( breit & wheeler 1934 ; heitler 1960 ) @xmath36 with @xmath37 \\ , .\\ ] ] the cross - section depends on @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath33 only through the speed @xmath38  in natural units  of the electron and of the positron in the center - of - mass @xmath39^{1/2}~,\\ ] ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq.sez.urto01012011 ] ) implies that the process is kinematically allowed for @xmath40 .",
    "the cross - section @xmath41 reaches its maximum @xmath42 for @xmath43 . assuming head - on collisions for definiteness ( @xmath44 )",
    ", it follows that @xmath45 gets maximized for the background photon energy @xmath46 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 correspond to the same redshift .",
    "explicitly , the situation can be summarized as follows .    * for @xmath47 the ebl plays the leading role .",
    "in particular , for @xmath48 @xmath45 is maximal for @xmath49 corresponding to far - ultraviolet soft photons , whereas for @xmath50 @xmath45 is maximal for @xmath51 corresponding to soft photons in the far - infrared . * for @xmath52",
    "the interaction with the cmb becomes dominant .",
    "* for @xmath53 the main source of opacity of the universe is the rb .",
    "within the standard @xmath54cdm cosmological model @xmath25 arises by first convolving the spectral number density @xmath55 of background photons at a generic redshift @xmath56 with @xmath57 for fixed values of @xmath56 , @xmath33 and @xmath58 , and next integrating over all these variables  ( gould & schreder 1967 ; fazio & stecker 1970 ) . hence , we have @xmath59 where the distance travelled by a photon per unit redshift at redshift @xmath56 is given by @xmath60^{1/2}}~,\\ ] ] with hubble constant @xmath61 , while @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent the average cosmic density of matter and dark energy , respectively , in units of the critical density @xmath64 .",
    "once @xmath65 is known , @xmath66 can be computed exactly ; generally the integration over @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) must be performed numerically .",
    "finally , in order to get a feeling about the considered physical situation , it looks suitable to discard cosmological effects , which evidently makes sense only for @xmath24 small enough .",
    "accordingly , @xmath24 is best expressed in terms of the source distance @xmath68 and the optical depth becomes   instead of @xmath1 . ]",
    "@xmath69 where @xmath70 is the photon mean free path for @xmath15 referring to the present cosmic epoch . as a consequence , eq .",
    "( [ probcp ] ) becomes @xmath71",
    "our main goal is at this point the determination of @xmath65 . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "we consider separately the ebl , the cmb and the rb .",
    "the ebl density @xmath65 is in principle affected by large uncertainties arising mainly from foreground contamination produced by zodiacal light which is various orders of magnitude larger than the ebl itself  ( hauser & dwek 2001 ) .",
    "below , we sketch schematically the different approaches that have been pursued , without any pretension of completeness .    * _ forward evolution _  this is the most ambitious approach , since it starts from first principles , namely from semi - analytic models of galaxy formation in order to predict the time evolution of the galaxy luminosity function  ( primack et al .",
    "2001 ; primack , bullock & sommerville 2005 ; gilmore et al .",
    "2009 ; gilmore et al .",
    "* _ backward evolution _ ",
    "this begins from observations of the present galaxy population and extrapolates the galaxy luminosity function backward in time . among others ,",
    "this strategy has been followed by stecker , malkan and scully  ( stecker , malkan & scully , 2006 )  whose result has unfortunately been ruled out by the measurements by _ fermi_/lat  ( abdo et al . 2010 )  and by franceschini , rodighiero and vaccari ( frv )  ( franceschini , rodighiero & vaccari 2008 ) . *",
    "_ inferred evolution _ ",
    "this approach models the ebl by using quantities like the star formation rate , the initial mass function and the dust extinction as inferred from observations  ( kneiske , mannheim & hartmann 2002 ; kneiske et al .",
    "2004 ; finke , razzaque & dermer 2010 ) . *",
    "_ observed evolution _  this method developed by dominguez and collaborators",
    "( d ) relies on observations by using a very rich sample of galaxies extending over the redshift range @xmath72  ( dominguez et al . 2011 ) . * _ compared observations _ ",
    "this technique has been implemented in two different ways .",
    "one consists in comparing observations of the ebl itself with blazar observations with imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) and deducing the ebl level from the vhe photon dimming  ( schrdter 2005 ; aharonian et al . 2006a ; mazin & raue 2007 ; mazin & gbel 2007 ; finke & razzaque 2009 ) .",
    "the other starts from some @xmath2-ray observations of a given blazar below @xmath73 where ebl absorption is negligible  typically using _",
    "fermi_/lat data  and infers the ebl level by comparing the iact observations of the same blazar with the source spectrum as extrapolated from former observations  ( orr , krennrich & dwek 2011 ) ( but see also  costamante 2012 ) . in the latter case",
    "the main assumption is that the emission mechanism is presumed to be determined with great accuracy . in either case ,",
    "the crucial unstated assumption is that photon propagation in the vhe band is governed by conventional physics . * _ minimal ebl model _ ",
    "its aim is to provide a strict lower limit on the ebl level .",
    "it relies on the same strategy underlying the _ inferred evolution _ , but with the parameters tuned in such a way to reproduce the ebl measurements from galaxy counts  ( kneiske & dole 2010 ) .",
    "quite remarkably , all methods  apart obviously the last one  yield basically the same results in the redshift range where they overlap , so that at variance with the time when the ca analysis was done ( 1997 ) nowadays the sed of the ebl is fixed to a very good extent .",
    "we will employ here the frv model  ( franceschini , rodighiero & vaccari 2008 ) but we shall check our results using the d model  ( dominguez et al . 2011 ) . as far as the cmb",
    "is concerned we take the standard temperature value @xmath74 .",
    "finally , the most recent available data for the rb are employed  ( gervasi et al . 2008 ) , with a low - frequency cutoff taken at 2 mhz .",
    "proceeding according to the above strategy  namely taking into account the ebl , the cmb and the rb  we directly evaluate @xmath75 over the energy range @xmath3 and within the source redshift interval @xmath76 , which is the range where the frv model yields the contribution of the ebl to @xmath75 ( the d model is restricted to @xmath77 ) . in the lack of any information about the ebl for @xmath78",
    ", we linearly extrapolate @xmath75 down to @xmath79 .",
    "such an extrapolation looks quite reliable not only since @xmath75 behaves linearly already in the range @xmath80 but mainly because at such low redshifts we have @xmath81 , and so eq . ( [ lungh26122010s ] ) indeed implies @xmath82",
    ". moreover , we stress that the extrapolation in question does not practically affect our result . for , as it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig1ultima ] for @xmath78 the energies @xmath1 for which @xmath75 takes our prescribed values tend to exceed @xmath13 , which means that our result for @xmath78 is dominated by the cmb and the rb rather than by the ebl .",
    "although we have computed @xmath75 using the frv model , we have checked that it basically remains unaffected by employing the d model in the redshift range where they overlap .",
    "this is our main result , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1ultima ] , where the solid line corresponds to @xmath83 , the dot - dashed line corresponds to @xmath84 , the dashed line corresponds to @xmath85 and the dotted line corresponds to @xmath86 , which give rise to an observed flux dimming of about @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "we see that for @xmath91 it turns out that @xmath10 for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "source redshifts @xmath24 at which the optical depth takes fixed values as a function of the observed hard photon energy @xmath1 .",
    "the curves from bottom to top correspond to a photon survival probability of @xmath5 ( the horizon ) , @xmath6 , @xmath92 and @xmath8 . for @xmath93",
    "the photon survival probability is larger than @xmath87 for any value of @xmath1 . ]",
    "in order to compare our finding with the ca result , we disregard cosmological effects thereby computing the @xmath15 mean free path @xmath94 in the local universe ( @xmath21 ) by using eq .",
    "( [ lungh26122010s ] ) with @xmath75 evaluated by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) with @xmath79 .    to facilitate the comparison between our and the ca results we have superposed in fig .",
    "[ fig2ultima ] the behavior of @xmath94 as found with the above procedure  represented by red dot - dashed line  over fig . 1 of ca , where the black lines represent the similar results derived by them ( see captions ) .",
    "there is of course little surprise that at @xmath21 our result is barely in agreement with that of ca at @xmath95 .",
    "still , it should be appreciated that the improved behaviour of @xmath94 found here is in disagreement with the one arising from a _ single _ choice of the ebl model in the ca analysis .",
    "in addition , while the cmb contribution is obviously identical in both cases , as far as the rb is concerned our curve  which corresponds to a low - frequency cutoff of 2 mhz  lies between those corresponding to the low - frequency cutoffs of 2 mhz and 1 mhz , respectively , of the ca result .",
    "comparison of the mean free path @xmath96 for @xmath15 as derived in the text using a low - frequency cutoff at 2 mhz ( red dot - dashed line ) with the one obtained by ca in the local universe ( @xmath95 ) as a function of the observed energy @xmath30 .",
    "the ca black lines labelled by @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 represent three different ebl models , the black solid line corresponds to the cmb , the black lines labelled by @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 represent a model of the rb with low - frequency cutoff at 5 , 2 and 1 mhz , respectively , and the black triangles correspond to the rb under the assumption that it is completely extragalactic . ]",
    "we have quantified by means of the optical depth the photon absorption caused by the pair - production process in the observed energy range @xmath3 and for a source redshift up to @xmath20 .",
    "we have found that depending on @xmath1 the absorption can be quite large for @xmath103 and becomes dramatic around @xmath104 .",
    "however , for @xmath93 the absorption is irrelevant for any value of @xmath1 .    as it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig1ultima ] , our conclusion is of great importance for the planned vhe detectors like cta , hawc and hiscore .",
    "moreover , we have specialized our analysis to the local universe ( @xmath21 ) where the optical depth is more conveniently replaced by the mean free path , and we have compared it with the same quantity as evaluated by coppi and aharonian in 1997 .    it has been realized that the blazars observed so far by iacts give rise to the _ pair - production anomaly_. the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration  ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006b ) first observed that the sed from the blazars h 2356 - 309 and 1es 1101 - 232 , at redshifts @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively , could be explained by a very low ebl level ; subsequently , the magic collaboration  ( magic collaboration 2008 ) have reinforced this evidence with the data from the agn 3c279 at @xmath107 .",
    "later , de angelis et al .  ( de angelis et al .",
    "2009 ) have observed this effect in the spectral indices at vhe of a sample of agn at @xmath108 . recently a statistical analysis of the sed from all blazars observed at vhe indicates a level of the ebl lower than that predicted even by the _ minimal ebl model _ ; the indication remains at a confidence level between 2.6 and 4.3 depending on the adopted ebl model  ( horns & meyer 2012 ; meyer , horns & raue 2012 ) . among many other things ,",
    "we find it very interesting to see whether this effect persists also at energies much higher than those presently explored by iacts , and our result looks essential as a benchmark for comparison .    in a forthcoming paper",
    "an analysis along the same lines of this work will be carried out taking axion - like particles ( alps ) into account , since photon - alp oscillations tend to drastically reduce photon absorption effects of the kind considered here , thereby considerably enlarging the @xmath2-ray horizon at the vhes that cta , hawc and hiscore will be able to probe ( see de angelis , galanti & roncadelli 2011 and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , it has very recently been pointed out that such a mechanism would explain the pair - production anomaly in a natural fashion and works for values of the photon - alp coupling in the reach of the planned upgrade of the alps experiment at desy  ( meyer , horns & raue 2013 ) .",
