    "recently , magnetic systems under a time dependent external magnetic field has been attracted much interest from both theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "it is a fact that the competition between the time scales of the relaxation time of the magnetically interacting system and period of the external applied magnetic field causes the observations of unusual and interesting dynamic behaviors .",
    "if the relaxation time is less than the period of the magnetic field , the time dependent magnetization of the system can follow the magnetic field . in contrary to this , when the frequency of the magnetic field rises then after a specific value of frequency , which sensitively depends on the amplitude of the magnetic field and the temperature as well as the geometry of the lattice and exchange interaction , it is able to follow the external magnetic field with phase lag .",
    "the physical mechanism discussed briefly above indicates the existence of a pure dynamic phase transition ( dpt ) @xcite .",
    "the time average of the magnetization over a full period of the oscillating magnetic field can be used as dynamic order parameter ( dop ) of the system .",
    "it is possible to mention that the another interesting behavior is hysteresis behavior , which is a common behavior and occurs in most of the physical systems .",
    "it originates from the delay of the response of the system to the driving cyclic force .",
    "magnetic hysteresis ( which is simply the variation of the magnetization with the driving magnetic field ) is one of the most important features of the magnetic materials . by benefiting from two important fundamental tools , namely coercive field ( cf ) and remanence magnetization ( rm ) , one can make prediction on the shape of the hysteresis loops .",
    "cf is defined as the intensity of the external magnetic field needed to change the sign of the magnetization .",
    "rm is residual magnetization of a ferromagnetic material after an external magnetic field is removed .",
    "in addition to these , there exists an important quantity which is hysteresis loop area ( hla ) corresponding to the energy loos due to the hysteretic behavior .",
    "due to recent developments experimental techniques , dpts and hysteresis behaviors can be observed experimentally in different types of magnetic systems .",
    "experiments on ultrathin co films @xcite , fe / au(001 ) films @xcite , epitaxial fe / gaas(001 ) thin films @xcite , fcc co(001 ) , and fcc nife / cu / co(001 ) layers @xcite fe / inas(001 ) ultrathin films @xcite are among them .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", dpt is first observed within the mean field approximation calculations ( mfa ) @xcite for the s-@xmath0 ising model . since than",
    ", dpt and hysteresis behaviors of the s-@xmath0 ising model have been widely studied within the several techniques such as mfa @xcite , monte carlo simulation ( mc ) @xcite , effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite .",
    "besides , in the ising case systems with higher spins @xcite and mixed spins @xcite have been studied . one can clearly think that ising model can be viewed as highly anisotropic case of the heisenberg model .",
    "actually , since all of the magnetic materials do not exhibit this type of anisotropy , it is necessary to consider heisenberg model to provide more realistic description of magnetic systems . in this way , it is obvious that a much more physical information can be obtained within the quantum heisenberg model which includes the quantum fluctuations .    in the heisenberg scheme , dpt and hysteresis behaviors mostly have been investigated in the classical case within the mc .",
    "classical isotropic heisenberg model @xcite and uniaxially classical anisotropic heisenberg model driven by sinusoidal magnetic field @xcite have been studied within the mc . in the case of",
    "dilute heisenberg model @xcite , classical anisotropic heisenberg model on thin film geometry @xcite have been studied within the mc also . besides , classical anisotropic heisenberg model within the mfa @xcite and classical anisotropic heisenberg model on thin film geometry in comparison with mfa and mc @xcite have been studied .",
    "the readers may refer to @xcite for a detailed discussion of these types of systems .",
    "it can be easily seen from literature mentioned briefly above that mc simulation is widely used to determine the true dynamic critic nature of these types of magnetic systems .",
    "however , from the computational investigation point of view , mc simulations for the quantum cases are expensive choice than the classical one . hence , in order to overcome this difficulty , some other well defined approximate techniques required . of course , one of the methods coming to mind is mfa .",
    "but , it is a well known fact that , in mfa , self spin correlations are ignored and the results to be obtained do not reflect the real details of system . because eft takes into account the self spin correlations , it gives results that are superior to those of obtained within the mfa . from this point of view , the aim of this work is to investigate the anisotropic quantum heisenberg model under a magnetic field oscillating in time within the eft formulation . for this aim",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ formulation ] we briefly present the model and formulation .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] , and finally sec . [ conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider a lattice consisting of @xmath1 identical spins of ( s-@xmath0 ) such that each of the spins has @xmath2 nearest neighbors .",
    "the hamiltonian of the kinetic heisenberg model is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the pauli spin operators at a site @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for the anisotropy in the exchange interactions between the nearest neighbor spins and @xmath9 is the time dependent external longitudinal magnetic field , respectively .",

    "time dependent magnetic field defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the amplitude and @xmath12 is the angular frequency of the periodic magnetic field .",
    "we use eft-2 ( two spin cluster eft ) formulation @xcite here , which based on using generalized versions of the callen - suzuki spin identities @xcite on the two spin clusters @xcite .",
    "these identities can be expanded with using differential operator technique @xcite .",

    "we use rk4 ( fourth order runge - kutta method ) for the solution of the eq .",
    "( [ denk11 ] ) .",
    "this iterative method starts some initial value of the magnetization ( @xmath50 ) and arrive the wanted solution after the convergency criteria @xmath51 satisfied . by this way",
    "we can obtain dop as    @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a stable and periodic function .",
    "two kind of solutions occur in these systems : symmetric solutions which corresponds to the paramagnetic phase ( p ) and nonsymmetric solutions which corresponds to the ferromagnetic phase ( f ) .",
    "symmetric solutions satisfy the property @xmath54 while nonsymmetric solutions do not satisfy of eq .",
    "( [ denk15 ] ) .",
    "although p and f solutions of eq .",
    "( [ denk11 ] ) can be obtained by any choice of the initial value @xmath50 , there can be some situations which the stable solutions depends on the choice of the initial value @xmath50 .",
    "phase related to this solutions called mixed phase ( f+p ) .",
    "dynamical critical points can be determined by obtaining the variation of the @xmath55 with temperature for given set of hamiltonian parameters .",
    "we can construct the hysteresis loops which are nothing but the variation of the @xmath56 with @xmath9 in one period of the periodic magnetic field .",
    "hereafter , once the hysteresis loop is determined , some quantities about it can be calculated .",
    "one of them is dynamical hla and can be calculated via integration over of the one period of the magnetic field , @xmath57 and corresponds to the energy loss due to the hysteresis .",
    "another two quantity which can describe the shape of the hysteresis loop can be determined , namely cf and rm .",

    "( [ denk17 ] ) we can say that , @xmath61 corresponds to the ising model , while @xmath62 rises starting from zero , system arrives to the isotropic heisenberg model ( @xmath63 ) with passing through the xxz type symmetric heisenberg model ( @xmath64 ) .    the physical mechanisms giving rise to the dpt , as well as the influences of the amplitude and frequency of the magnetic field on the hysteresis behaviors are well known .",
    "detailed explanations can be found in refs .",
    "so , we want to focus only on the effect of the anisotropy in the exchange interaction on both phase diagrams and hysteresis behaviors .",
    "we set the value of @xmath65 throughout our numerical calculations .",
    "variations of the dynamical critical temperatures ( @xmath66 ) with the amplitude of the magnetic field ( @xmath67 ) can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ sek1 ] ) , for isotropic heisenberg model ( curves labeled by b ) in comparison with the ising model ( curves labeled by a ) .",
    "dynamic phase boundaries ( dpbs ) separating dynamically ordered and disordered phases have been drawn for two selected values of applied field frequency @xmath68 in fig .",
    "( [ sek1 ] ) ( a ) and @xmath69 in fig .",
    "( [ sek1 ] ) ( b ) , respectively .",
    "one can clearly see from the fig .",
    "( [ sek1 ] ) that dpb related to the ising case lies above of the isotropic heisenberg case which means that rising anisotropy gives rise to shift the dynamical critical point to upwards in the @xmath70 plane . for a fixed sets of amplitude and frequency of the applied field ,",
    "when the anisotropy increases , the spins tend to align in @xmath2 direction , hence , more thermal energy is needed to broke the aforementioned spin alignment and to observe a dpt . in accordance with the expectations , for value of @xmath71 corresponding to the static ising model for the simple cubic lattice , both of the dpbs regarding to the ising model start with the same critical temperature @xmath72 .",
    "the same situation is also valid for the phase diagrams of the isotropic heisenberg model , at zero magnetic field amplitude @xmath73 .",
    "an increment in value of @xmath67 causes to decline the critical temperature . in the regions of higher values of the amplitude and lower values of the temperature , dynamic first order transitions",
    "furthermore , the region which is limited by this first order line ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "( [ sek1 ] ) ) and second order line , f+p phases appear , as explained in detail in the sec .",
    "( [ formulation ] ) .",
    "time dependent magnetization of the system strongly depends on the selected value of the initial magnetization ( @xmath50 ) in coexistence region . in order to show these types of treatments , in fig .",
    "( [ sek2 ] ) we choose two representative behaviors of the magnetizations with time ( t ) , for the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "the frequency is chosen as @xmath69 and the other parameters are chosen as such that give rise to existence of a f+p phase ( fig .",
    "( [ sek2 ] ) ( a ) ) and f phase ( fig .",
    "( [ sek2 ] ) ( b ) ) . for each plot , two initial values of magnetization , namely @xmath74 ( curve labeled by a ) and @xmath75 ( curve labeled by b ) are selected .",
    "it can be easily seen from the fig .",
    "( [ sek2 ] ) ( a ) that depending upon the selected values of initial condition , the time dependent magnetizations oscillate around different magnetization values during the rk4 iteration indicating a f+p phase , whereas this is not the case for fig .",
    "( [ sek2 ] ) ( b ) .",
    "moreover , as seen in fig .",
    "( [ sek1 ] ) that , the considered magnetic system exhibits a dynamic tricritcal point ( dtcp ) where dynamic first and second order phase transition lines meet",
    ". one can conclude from fig .",
    "( [ sek1 ] ) that , when the value of the applied field frequency increases , the temperature coordinates of the dtcps shift to upper region for both ising and heisenberg models .",
    "it should be noted here that the aforementioned situation is consistent with the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite where dynamic phase transition properties of the classic heisenberg model is analyzed by making use of mfa .",
    "it is also beneficial to adress that temperature coordinate of the dtcp of ising model seems to be above point of the isotropic heisenberg model for considered values of frequencies .    by the way",
    ", we want to underline an important point concerning of dpbs . for a considered value of @xmath62 , we have three parameters affecting the dynamic critical nature of the system , and if one keeps the two of them fixed , inducing dpt comes from the third one .",
    "so , based on fig .",
    "( [ sek1 ] ) it can be said that critical temperature as well as critical amplitude values of the ising model are higher than the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "we can say following the same analogy that , the value of the critical frequency of the ising model is lower than the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "this means that , rising anisotropy in the exchange interaction causes to decline of the critical frequency value .      in fig .",
    "( [ sek3 ] ) we give the frequency variation ( @xmath12 ) of the hla for the parameters mentioned above .",
    "all curves except from the curve labeled by a in fig .",
    "( [ sek3 ] ) ( a ) are related to the dynamically paramagnetic phase . for the values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 the system passes to the ferromagnetic phase at @xmath78 which shows itself in the curve labeled a in fig .",
    "( [ sek3 ] ) ( a ) . for the dynamically paramagnetic phase ,",
    "when @xmath12 increases , value of hla increases starting from a certain value depending on the system parameters and shows a frequency induced maximum , then , it begins to fall .",
    "for the curve labeled by a in fig .",
    "( [ sek3 ] ) ( a ) , hla falls faster than the others for the values of frequency that provide @xmath79 , due to the occurence of the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic dpt . besides , the curves related to the higher amplitudes are above of others ( e.g. compare curves labeled by c and b in fig .",
    "( [ sek3 ] ) ( b ) ) .",
    "the other typical situation is , maximum value of hla of the system with higher temperature is lower than the system with lower temperature ( e.g. compare curves labeled by c in figs .",
    "( [ sek3 ] ) ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "frequency variation of cf , for the parameter values mentioned above , can be seen in fig .",

    "( [ sek4 ] ) ( a )",

    "( [ sek4 ] ) ( a ) and ( b ) this behavior is valid both of the chosen temperatures . for the curve labeled by a in fig .",

    "in other words @xmath81 can be satisfied while @xmath82 according to the eq .",
    "( [ denk14 ] ) .",

    "after than , rising frequency decreases the rm .",
    "in contrast to this , for higher temperatures ( fig .",
    "( [ sek5 ] ) ( b ) ) , rising frequency first slightly rises rm , after it reaches the maximum value , starts to decrease while @xmath12 rises . the curve labeled by a in fig .",
    "( [ sek5 ] ) ( a ) is related to the situation where the dpt occurs from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic one , with rising frequency of the magnetic field .",
    "the trend mentioned above changes at a value of @xmath80 as seen in curve labeled by a fig .",
    "( [ sek5 ] ) ( a ) .",
    "two branch of the rm curve shift upwards , means that hysteresis loops shifts upwards in the @xmath86 plane for the rising frequency that provide @xmath79 .",
    "behavior of the curves labeled by a in figs .",
    "( [ sek3 ] ) ( a ) , ( [ sek4 ] ) ( a ) and ( [ sek5 ] ) ( a ) , can be seen more clearly from fig .",
    "( [ sek6 ] ) , which is hysteresis loops for the @xmath87 and selected values of frequency around the value of @xmath80 .",
    "the curves related to the frequency values @xmath88 are symmetric about the origin and they are related to the paramagnetic phase .",
    "all other curves are related to the ferromagnetic phase . as seen in fig .",
    "( [ sek6 ] ) , rising frequency results the hysteresis loops shift upwards .",
    "altough the system is in the ferromagnetic phase , cf is nonzero until the frequency reaches to the value of @xmath89 .",
    "after this value cf is zero .",
    "similar situation is valid for the rm . for the values of @xmath90 rm",
    "has two values which are one of is positive and the other one is negative . for the loop related to the @xmath91 , lower value of the rm gets the value of zero and after this value , rising frequency results both of the rm values positive .",
    "after this short conclusions about the hysteresis loop behaviors with rising frequency of the magnetic field , let us look at the effect of the rising anisotropy in the exchange interaction on the behavior of the hysteresis loops .",
    "the variation of the hla with frequency can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ sek7 ] ) for the values of @xmath87 and @xmath92 i.e. ising model , xxz model ( with @xmath93 ) and isotropic heisenberg model , respectively . as seen in the fig .",

    "( [ sek7 ] ) that , for lower frequency values , when the anisotropy in the exchange interaction rises hla increases , while for the higher values of the frequency , this situation getting reverse . in other words ,",
    "the value of hla of the ising model is higher than that of the isotropic heisenberg model , while after the value of @xmath96 hla of the isotropic heisenberg model is higher than that of the ising model .",
    "we will talk more about this situation below .",
    "the same situation is valid for the behavior of the cf .",
    "the variation of the cf with the frequency can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ sek8 ] ) ( a ) for three of the model . for lower values of the frequency cf of the ising model is slightly higher than that of the isotropic heisenberg model .",

    "cf of the xxz model always lies between these two cf values , namely cf of the ising model and isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "the difference of the critical frequency values of the models that have different anisotropies shows itself in the values of the frequencies , where cf starts to fall zero . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "( [ sek8 ] ) ( b ) we can see the variation of the rm with frequency for these three models",
    ". two branch of the rm for different models are almost the same for the low frequency region . after the dpt frequency of the ising model , rm of the ising model lies above of the two others , while for the higher frequencies these three curves approach each other .",
    "all these observations about the effect of the anisotropy in the exchange interaction can be seen more clearly in the hysteresis loops . in fig .",
    "( [ sek9 ] ) we depict the hysteresis loops of the three aforementioned models , for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with selected frequency values . for the value of @xmath97 ,",
    "ising hysteresis loop lies outside of the others ( fig .",
    "( [ sek9 ] ) ( a ) ) , means that hla of the ising hysteresis loop is the greatest one .",
    "when the frequency rises , the shape of the loops change and ising loop starts to settle inside to the other hysteresis loops ( fig .",
    "( [ sek9 ] ) ( b ) and ( c ) ) . up",
    "to now all models are in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "while the frequency rises , after the value of @xmath98 ising model passes to the ferromagnetic phase , the hysteresis loop for the ising model starts to move upward ( fig .",
    "( [ sek9 ] ) ( d ) ) . similarly after the value of @xmath99 , xxz model ( with @xmath93 ) passes to the ferromagnetic phase ( fig .",
    "( [ sek9 ] ) ( e ) ) . finally , since the @xmath100 ( which is the critical frequency of the isotropic heisenberg model ) all loops in fig .",
    "( [ sek9 ] ) ( f ) are related to the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "lastly we want to touch upon the relation between the hla values of ising and isotropic hesenberg model .",
    "we have concluded from fig .",
    "( [ sek7 ] ) that , greatness relationship of the hla of these two model has been changed while @xmath12 rises , for certain values of @xmath101 .",
    "we have denoted this frequency value as @xmath102 . for lower frequencies ,",
    "hla of the ising model is greater than that of the isotroic heisenberg model while after the value of @xmath102 , hla of the isotropic heisenberg model is greater than that of the ising model .",
    "now a question naturally arise : is this behavior general for all amplitude and temperature values ? what is the dependence of the @xmath102 on other parameter values ?",
    "we have to mention here that , there is no special reason to talk about this @xmath102 value .",
    "if we have held @xmath12 and @xmath67 constant , we would have talking about the @xmath103 , which is defined in a similar way of @xmath102 .",
    "the answer of the first question is , mentioned behavior is not general for all amplitude and temperature values .",
    "our calculations show that , in the ferromagnetic phase of the ising model , hla of the ising model always little than the isotropic heisenberg model . of course not for very low temperature and amplitude values . for these values , hysteresis loop is nothing but almost a line which is parallel to the @xmath104 axis .",
    "ising model is highly anisotropic , then spins tend to align in same direction along the anisotropy axis , in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "thus it is more difficult to magnetic field affect on this situation , in comparison with the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "this can be seen also in figs .",
    "( [ sek9 ] ) ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "thus in the ferromagnetic phase of the ising model , the effect of the rising anisotropy in the exchange interaction is simply decreasing of the hla while other parameters are fixed .",
    "in other words , at a given ( @xmath101 ) s , if the ising model can show the dpt from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase , when the frequency rises , then @xmath102 will appear at a certain value of the frequency .",
    "but if the ising model can not show the dpt , at that pair of ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath102 will not appear .",
    "if @xmath102 will not appear , the hla of the ising model is always little than the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "now the second question , if @xmath102 present , then how it changes while the values of temperature and amplitude change ? the variation of the hla with frequency of ising and isotropic heisenberg model for some choosen values of ( @xmath101 ) can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ sek10 ] ) . as seen in fig .",
    "( [ sek10 ] ) that , for a fixed value of @xmath67 , when the temperature rises , @xmath102 increases ( compare fig .",

    "we can see this in fig .",
    "( [ sek11 ] ) , which is the variation of the @xmath102 with @xmath105 ( shown by dashed lines ) for selected values of @xmath106 , in comparison with the @xmath80 of the ising model ( shown by solid lines ) . for the point @xmath107 which is under the @xmath67 ( solid ) curve",

    "this can be seen in in fig .",
    "( [ sek11 ] ) as , difference between the @xmath80 and @xmath102 curves in the lower values of the tempearture , for any of the chosen @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast to this , for higher values of the temperature the value of @xmath102 getting same as the @xmath80 .",
    "in conclusion , for a simple cubic lattice , the effect of the anisotropy in the exchange interaction on the dynamic phase diagrams and hysteresis loops within the anisotropic quantum heisenberg model driving by sinusoidal time dependent magnetic field has been investigated by benefiting from effective field theory for two spin cluster .",
    "dynamics of the system is defined by using glauber - type stochastic process .",
    "first of all , the dynamic phase diagrams of the simple cubic lattice have been drawn in the @xmath109 plane for two limits of the model namely , isotropic heisenberg model and its highly anisotropic limit , ising model .",
    "it is concluded that , rising anisotropy in the exchange interaction causes to increase of the critical temperature as well as critical field amplitude . on the other hand",
    ", rising anisotropy in the exchange interaction causes to decline of the critical frequency value .",
    "besides , dynamic first order transitions appears at higher magnetic field amplitude and lower temperature values at all of the anisotropy in the exchange interaction values .    instead of plotting the hysteresis loops for different possible values of the anisotropy values ,",
    "they have been treated based on three fundamental properties hla , cf and rm .",
    "one advantage of the eft is capability of the investigating large ranges of hamiltonian parameters due to the short computation time in contrast to ( quantum ) mc . after rewieving the general effect of the rising frequency on the hla , cf and rm both for isotropic heisenberg and ising model , detailed investigation devoted on the effect of the rising anisotropy in the exchange interaction on the hla .",
    "it is concluded that for the ferromagnetic phase of the ising model , hla of the ising model is lower than the isotropic heisenberg model within the same values of the parameters , namely @xmath110 .",
    "rising anisotropy in the exchange interaction on the hla in this region causes decreasing hla .",
    "but , when the ising model is in the paramagnetic phase , this situation does not hold .",
    "after a specific value of the frequency ( which is denoted by @xmath102 ) , hla of the ising model is little than the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "the variation of the @xmath102 with @xmath105 is given for different values of @xmath67 .",
    "then , for the paramagnetic phase of the ising model , eft-2 formulation gives the conclusion : for the values that provide @xmath111 rising anisotropy in the exchange interaction causes to increase of the hla , at a fixed values of amplitude and temperature .",
    "of course , this @xmath102 value depends on the amplitude and temperature .",
    "this point needs to be verified more accurate formulations such as ( quantum ) mc .        b.k .",
