    "the concept of @xmath0 quantum phase transitions has emerged as an overarching theme in strongly correlated electron physics @xcite .",

    "how high in temperature does the effect of the quantum critical point persist?@xcite do quantum fluctuations remain strong enough at elevated temperatures to account for the mechanism of exotic superconductivity in copper oxides , iron pnictides , and heavy fermions systems ?",
    "the dearth of appropriate model materials for rigorously solvable hamiltonians has not permitted experimentalists to address these fundamental questions concretely , even for the transverse field ising chain ( tfic ) @xcite , a celebrated textbook example of quantum criticality @xcite .",
    "very recently , the ising chain material conb@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite was proposed to be an ideal model system of the tfic based on neutron scattering measurements in transverse magnetic fields @xcite , paving a new avenue to investigate the finite temperature effects on quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "the tfic hamiltonian is deceptively simple @xcite ; @xmath11 where @xmath10 ( @xmath12 for ferromagnetic ising chains in conb@xmath1o@xmath2 ) represents the nearest - neighbor spin - spin exchange interaction , @xmath13 is the _",

    "since @xmath18 and @xmath19 do not commute , the classical ising hamiltonian for @xmath20 becomes the quantum tfic hamiltonian for @xmath21 .",
    "the qcp is located at @xmath22 , where the applied field is tuned precisely at @xmath16 ; a magnetic field greater than @xmath16 coerces the magnetic moments along its direction and transforms the @xmath0 ferromagnetic ground state to a paramagnetic state .",
    "see fig .  1 for the generic theoretical phase diagram of the tfic @xcite .",
    "in spite of its apparent simplicity , the tfic served as the foundational model for quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , and continues to attract attention in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of working with the tfic as a model system for testing the fundamental ideas of quantum phase transitions is that , in the absence of a transverse magnetic field ( @xmath20 ) , the thermodynamic properties of the ising chain can be rigorously solved at arbitrary temperatures @xcite . even in a finite transverse field ( @xmath23 ) ,",
    "the tfic is well understood at @xmath0 @xcite , and qc ( quantum critical ) scaling theory extended the @xmath0 results to finite temperatures @xcite .",

    "the co - o - co chains propagate along the c - axis , and the easy axis of the co moments lies within the ac - plane @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic super - exchange interaction between the nearest - neighbor co ions is estimated to be @xmath24 k , based on esr @xcite and neutron scattering @xcite measurements . from the disappearance of magnetic bragg peaks in the transverse magnetic field applied along the b - axis ,",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) critical field was estimated to be @xmath25 tesla @xcite .",
    "the inter - chain couplings between adjacent co chains are antiferromagnetic @xcite , weaker than @xmath10 by an order of magnitude @xcite , and frustrated @xcite .",
    "this means that the 3d magnetic long range order induced by inter - chain interactions , which tends to mask the effects of the one dimensional ( 1d ) qcp of the individual ising chains , is suppressed ; the 3d ordering temperature is as low as @xmath26 k even in @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "combined with the modest @xmath10 , ising chains in conb@xmath1o@xmath2 are ideal for testing the tfic hamiltonian , but were overlooked for three decades .    in what follows , we will report @xmath3nb nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) investigation of quantum spin fluctuations in conb@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "nmr is a powerful low energy probe , and good at probing the physical properties near qcp s @xcite .",
    "we will map the evolution of low energy quantum fluctuations of co spins near the qcp , by taking advantage of the hyperfine interactions between co electron spins and @xmath3nb nuclear spins .",
    "we will experimentally verify the phase diagram of the tfic in fig .  1 above @xmath0 for the first time , and demonstrate that the effect of the qcp persists at finite temperatures as high as @xmath9 .",
    "we grew the conb@xmath28o@xmath29 single crystal from a stoichiometric mixture of cobalt and niobium oxides using a floating zone furnace .",
    "we assessed the surface quality and oriented the crystal utilizing laue x - ray diffractometry .",
    "once the material was sectioned into oriented slices along the a , b and c crystallographic directions , these were individually scanned with the laue diffractometer and showed a uniform , single - crystalline structure .",
    "a small section of the single crystal was ground into a powder and analyzed using powder x - ray diffraction which showed only single phase cobalt niobate in the crystal within instrument resolution .",

    "we glued the crystal to a sturdy sample holder made of machinable aluminum - oxide ( macor ceramic ) with a thickness of @xmath30 mm to ensure that the crystal orientation did not change at low temperatures .",
    "we found that the strong magnetic torque applied to the crystal by the external magnetic field could easily bend sample holders made of soft materials such as plexiglass or plastic , and introduce noticeable systematic errors below @xmath31  k.    we observed @xmath3nb nmr in a broad range of temperature from 2  k ( @xmath32 ) up to 295  k. we show the typical @xmath3nb nmr spectrum in the inset of fig .",
    "since the @xmath3nb nuclear spin is @xmath33 , we observed 4 pairs of satellite transitions split by a quadrupole frequency @xmath34 mhz , in addition to the large central peak arising from the @xmath35 to @xmath36 transition . in the main panel of fig .  3",
    ", we also show the temperature dependence of the central transition in @xmath37 tesla applied along the b - axis .",

    "the typical width of the @xmath43 pulse was @xmath44s .",
    "we fit these recovery curves to the solutions of the rate equation @xcite : @xmath45 with three free parameters : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath38 . by solving the coupled rate equations for @xmath48 under the appropriate initial condition , one can calculate and fix the coefficients as @xmath49 for the central transition and ( 0.001 , 0.0112 , 0.0538 , 0.1485 , 0.2564 , 0.2797 , 0.1828 , 0.0606 , 0.0061 ) for the @xmath50 to @xmath51 fourth satellite transitions , while @xmath52 for both cases @xcite .",
    "an example of the signal recovery of the central transition observed at 130  k in @xmath53 tesla is shown in fig .  4 , in comparison to that observed for a fourth satellite transition on the higher frequency side .",
    "our results in fig .",
    "4 confirm that the best fit values of @xmath38 agree within @xmath54 % between the central and satellite transitions .",
    "the central transition is the strongest among all 9 peaks as shown in the inset of fig .  3 , and hence most advantageous in terms of the signal intensity .",
    "when the relaxation rate exceeds @xmath55 s@xmath56 , however , accurate measurements of @xmath38 using the central transition become increasingly difficult because the recovery curve @xmath41 is dominated by two extremely fast normal modes , @xmath57 ; the signal intensity , @xmath41 , begins to recover at a time scale comparable to the inversion pulse width .",
    "accordingly , measurements of @xmath38 using the fourth satellite transition become more advantageous in the low temperature , low field regime , because its recovery curve is dominated by slower normal modes , @xmath58 .",
    "we present an additional example of the @xmath38 measurement using the fourth satellite at 2 k and @xmath59  tesla in fig .",
    "in fig .  5 , we summarize the @xmath5 and @xmath6 dependences of @xmath38 .",
    "notice that @xmath38 varies by more than three orders of magnitude between @xmath53 and 9 t. quite generally , @xmath38 probes the wave vector @xmath60-integral within the first brillouin zone of the dynamical spin structure factor @xmath61 at the nmr frequency @xmath62 ( @xmath63 mhz ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the hyperfine coupling between the observed nuclear spin and pauli matrices .",
    "in essence , @xmath38 measures the strength of co spin fluctuations at the time scale set by the nmr frequency .    our @xmath38 data in fig .",
    "5 exhibits two distinct field regimes at low temperatures , because the spin excitation spectrum changes its character across @xmath16 , as summarized in fig .",
    "below @xmath66 tesla , @xmath38 diverges gradually toward @xmath0 , signaling the critical slowing down of co spin fluctuations in the rc ( renormalized classical @xcite ) regime of fig .  1 toward the @xmath0 ferromagnetic ground state of each individual ising chain .",
    "in other words , the spectral weight of the co spin - spin correlation function grows at the quasi - elastic peak located at @xmath67 in fig .",
    "6(a ) below @xmath66 tesla .",
    "the co spin - spin correlation length @xmath68 along the chain grows as @xmath69 in the rc regime @xcite , where @xmath70 is the gap in the spin excitation spectrum as defined in fig .",
    "accordingly , we expect @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "we summarize the details of the theoretical expressions of @xmath38 for the tfic in appendix a.    in contrast , @xmath38 observed above @xmath66 tesla saturates and begins to decrease with temperature .",
    "we recall that the @xmath0 ground state remains paramagnetic in the qd ( quantum disordered ) regime above @xmath16 , as shown in fig .  1 , and hence there is no quasi - elastic mode of spin excitations in fig .  6(b ) .",
    "the latter implies that @xmath38 in the qd regime is dominated by the thermal activation of spin excitations across the gap , @xmath73 .",
    "therefore we expect @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "we have thus identified the 1d qcp ( one dimensional qc point ) of each individual ising chain as @xmath66 tesla .      in fig .",
    "7(a ) , we present the exponential fit of @xmath76 with @xmath70 as a free parameter .",
    "we summarize the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath70 in fig .",
    ". the fitting range barely satisfies @xmath77 near @xmath78 tesla , limiting the accuracy of our estimation of @xmath70 . to improve the accuracy , we constructed the scaling plots of @xmath79 as a function of @xmath80 in fig .  8 .",
    "we first estimated the magnitude of @xmath70 from fig .",
    "subsequently , for the field range between 5.0 and 6.7 t , we made slight adjustments to the magnitude of @xmath70 to improve the scaling collapse in fig .",
    "the final results of @xmath70 thus estimated from fig .",
    "8 are presented in fig .",
    "7(b ) using @xmath81 .",
    "we note that this procedure changes the estimated value of @xmath70 only by a few k.    remarkably , we found that @xmath70 varies linearly with @xmath6 .",
    "this linear behavior is precisely what we expect from the theoretical prediction for the nearest - neighbor quantum ising chain , @xmath82 @xcite . from the intercept of the linear fit with the horizontal axes",
    ", we estimate @xmath17 tesla .",
    "this 1d critical field observed by our nmr measurements agrees very well with the earlier observation of the saturation of the so - called e8 golden ratio @xcite . from the intercept of the linear fit with the vertical axis",
    ", we also estimate @xmath83 k , in excellent agreement with earlier reports based on esr @xcite and neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "we present the color plot of @xmath38 in fig .",
    "9 . also shown in fig .",
    "9 is the crossover temperatures , @xmath70 and @xmath73 , based on the linear fit in fig .",
    "our color plot visually captures the crossover from the qc regime to the rc and qd regimes successfully .",
    "we are the first to verify the theoretical @xmath84 phase diagram in fig .  1 for finite temperatures , @xmath85 , using an actual material .      having established the phase diagram of the tfic in conb@xmath1o@xmath2 , we are ready to test the finite temperature properties of the qc regime located between the rc and qd regimes . at the 1d critical field @xmath16 , we applied qc scaling to eq.(3 ) , and obtained @xmath86 for the nearest - neighbor tfic ( see eq .",
    "( a7 ) below for the details ) .",
    "we determined the hyperfine form factor @xmath87 based on the @xmath3nb nmr frequency shift measurements , and used eq .",
    "( 4 ) to estimate @xmath88 s@xmath56 at finite temperatures above the qcp _ without any adjustable parameters_. we refer readers to appendix b for the details of the data analysis .",
    "this parameter - free prediction is in excellent quantitative agreement with our experimental finding , @xmath89 s@xmath56 as shown by a solid line in fig .",
    "5 through the data points observed at 5.2  t. thus the qc scaling theory accounts for the low frequency spin dynamics of the tfic above @xmath0 at a quantitative level .",
    "it is equally important to realize that @xmath38 data exhibits the expected power - law behavior , @xmath90 , up to @xmath91 k , which corresponds to @xmath92 .",
    "our finding therefore addresses an important and unresolved question that has been facing the strongly correlated electrons community for years : _ how high in temperature",
    "does the effect of the qcp persist ?",
    "_ for the tfic , the quantum fluctuations originating from the zero temperature qcp persist up to as high as @xmath92 .",
    "our experimental finding is consistent with the earlier theoretical report that the qc scaling holds up to @xmath93 for the tfic @xcite .",
    "using the quasi one - dimensional co chains in conb@xmath1o@xmath2 , we experimentally tested the quantum criticality of the transverse field ising chain ( tfic ) at finite temperatures above @xmath0 for the first time .",
    "based on the measurements of the @xmath3nb longitudinal relaxation rate @xmath38 , we identified the distinct behaviors of low - frequency spin fluctuations in the renormalized classical ( rc ) , quantum critical ( qc ) , and quantum disordered ( qd ) scaling regimes of the tfic , and constructed the @xmath84 phase diagram of the tfic in fig .  9 .",
    "we observed no evidence for a crossover into the 3d regime in the temperature and field range of our concern .",
    "we also reported the transverse field ( @xmath6 ) dependence of the spin excitation gap parameter @xmath70 in fig .",
    "7(b ) ; our results exhibit a linear dependence on @xmath6 , in agreement with the theoretical prediction for the nearest - neighbor tfic .",
    "our @xmath38 data observed for the qc regime near @xmath94 t exhibit the expected mild power law divergence , @xmath90 toward the quantum critical point at @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the parameter - free prediction based on quantum critical scaling reproduces the magnitude of @xmath38 within @xmath95 % .",
    "our results in fig .  5",
    "establish that the quantum critical behavior persists to as high as @xmath9 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first example of the quantitative test of the finite temperature effects on quantum criticality for model hamiltonians with a rigorously solvable ground state .",
    "we mark the upper bound of the qc scaling regime , @xmath9 , in fig .  9 with a horizontal arrow .",
    "such a robust quantum criticality observed at finite temperatures above the qcp is in stark contrast with the case of thermally induced _",
    "classical _ phase transitions ; the critical region of the latter generally narrows as the phase transition temperature approaches zero , and eventually diminishes at @xmath0 @xcite .",
