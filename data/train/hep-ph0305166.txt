    "implications of non - vanishing neutrino masses are accumulating from the experiments for solar @xcite and atmospheric @xcite neutrinos which show neutrino oscillations .",
    "this is the first experimental evidence that suggests physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the possibility of oscillation has also been examined by the neutrinos from nuclear reactors .",
    "the negative result of chooz  @xcite gives constraints on the masses and mixing allowed for the neutrinos .",
    "the result of kamland @xcite confirms the oscillations of the solar neutrinos .",
    "it is a task for the extension of the sm to accommodate these experimental results . in particular , the extreme smallness of the masses and the largeness of the generation mixing angles , both of which",
    "are observed in the experiments , should be accounted for naturally .    from a theoretical point of view , it is reasonable for the sm to be extended under grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "furthermore , supersymmetry may have to be introduced in order that the sm be consistently embedded in gut models . on the other hand ,",
    "some of the gut models , such as those based on so(10 )  @xcite , automatically contain right - handed neutrinos .",
    "if they have large majorana masses , the lightness of the neutrinos could be naturally understood .",
    "the plausibility of supersymmetric gut models as the extension of the sm are then further strengthened .",
    "one tough obstacle confronts gut models , concerning the generation mixing of the leptons .",
    "the lepton mixing is described by the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix as the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix does the quark mixing .",
    "contrary to the ckm matrix , the observed neutrino oscillations show that the off - diagonal elements of the mns matrix are not suppressed .",
    "however , since the leptons and the quarks are contained in the same representations of the grand unified group , similar magnitudes are deduced , by simple consideration , for corresponding elements of the two matrices .",
    "a successful gut model is required to naturally implement the difference of mixing between the quarks and the leptons .",
    "although there are various solutions advocated for the problem @xcite , rather contrived schemes have been invoked .",
    "aiming at a natural explanation for the generation mixings of the leptons and the quarks , we present a model base on so(10 ) and supersymmetry in which the difference is simply attributed to the higgs boson structure @xcite .",
    "this model includes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 representations of the so(10 ) group for the higgs bosons which give masses to the quarks and leptons .",
    "the @xmath1 representation becomes the origin of the different generation mixings .",
    "large majorana masses for the right - handed neutrinos are generated by a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the @xmath2 representation .",
    "below the gut energy scale , this model is described as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with dimension-5 operators composed of the su(2 ) doublet superfields for the left - handed leptons and the higgs bosons .",
    "the coefficients of the higgs couplings with the quarks and leptons evolve between the energy scales of gut and electroweak theory .",
    "we obtain the renormalization group equations for the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrices and the independent arguments of the mns and ckm matrices .",
    "quantitative analyses are then made on the neutrino oscillations .",
    "it is shown that the lepton mixing observed is compatible with the quark mixing in certain ranges of the model parameters .    in so(10 )",
    "gut models the higgs bosons for the quark and lepton masses must be contained in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 representations .",
    "the direct product for one of these three representations with two spinor @xmath3 representations for the quarks and leptons becomes an so(10 ) singlet .",
    "the model with two higgs fields of @xmath0 and @xmath2 has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "however , all the experimental results for the neutrino oscillations are only marginally accommodated .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath4 representations make the higgs couplings symmetric on the generation indices , and their su(2)-doublet components couple to both the quarks and the leptons . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath1 representation leads to antisymmetric higgs couplings , and the su(2)-doublet components which couple to the quarks may be different from those to the leptons . by including @xmath1 ,",
    "the correlation of the masses and mixings between the quarks and the leptons becomes more flexible .    in sect .",
    "2 we summarize the interpretation of neutrino oscillations in the framework of the model with three generations for leptons . in sect .",
    "3 the renormalization group equations for the mssm with the dimension-5 operators are obtained explicitly in terms of independent parameters for the coefficients of higgs couplings with quarks and leptons . in sect .",

    "a plausible model is specified . in sect .",
    "5 we make numerical analyses of the masses and mixing of the neutrinos .",
    "conclusions are given in sect .",
    "the deficit of neutrinos from the sun and the anomaly for neutrinos from the atmosphere can be explained by neutrino oscillations .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino observation gives that the mass - squared difference and the mixing angle between the @xmath5-neutrino and a certain neutrino are given by @xmath6 there are several oscillation scenarios for the solar neutrino problem .",
    "however , a most likely solution is given by a large mixing angle between the @xmath7-neutrino and a certain neutrino under the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein effect , suggesting the ranges @xmath8 the measurements by kamland are consistent with these results .",
    "on the other hand , by the experiment of chooz the oscillation has not been observed for the @xmath7-neutrino , which excludes the combined region @xmath9 these experimental measurements are taken into consideration in constructing our model .",
    "we interpret the above results in the model with three generations of massive neutrinos . in this framework",
    "the strength of the @xmath10-boson interaction for a neutrino and a charged lepton depends on the generations .",

    "the dimension-5 superpotential @xmath45 yields the operators @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 represent the scalar components of the superfield @xmath38 . at the electroweak energy scale where the su(2)-doublet higgs bosons have non - vanishing vevs , these dimension-5 operators become tiny majorana mass terms for the left - handed neutrinos .",
