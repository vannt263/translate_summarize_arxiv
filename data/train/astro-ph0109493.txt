    "the detection of optical broad - emission - lines @xcite and high brightness - temperature ( @xmath5  k ) radio cores @xcite in the nuclei of a well - defined sample of nearby bright galaxies ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a ) indicates that at least 20% of all nearby bright galaxies have an accreting massive black hole .",

    "their low nuclear luminosities require either very low accretion rates ( @xmath610@xmath7l@xmath8 ; e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or radiative efficiencies ( the ratio of radiated energy to accreted mass ) much lower than the typical value of @xmath610% ( e.g.  chapter  7.8 of * ? ? ?",

    "the sub - parcsec radio emission in llagns may originate in an adaf or cdaf inflow , and the predictions of these models are discussed in the following section .",
    "the sub - parsec radio emission may alternatively originate in synchrotron radiation from discrete plasma components or from the base of a continuous jet ejected from the central engine . in the former case , the presence of different self - absorption frequencies for individual components results in a flat spectral - shape ( @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ) for the overall system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the latter case , i.e. for relativistic electrons at the base of a continuous , freely expanding jet @xcite , the variation of the electron density ( n@xmath11 ) , electron temperature ( @xmath12 ) , and magnetic field ( @xmath13 ) , where @xmath14 is the distance along the jet axis , results in a flat overall radio spectrum .",
    "slightly inverted spectra ( up to @xmath15 ) may result from the bulk acceleration of the jet plasma @xcite , and even higher ( temporary ) values of @xmath16 may be measured during radio outbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on larger scales",
    "the synchrotron emission from the ejecta or jet becomes optically - thin ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus the spectral index of the overall synchrotron emission from a ` jet ' is expected to be between 0.2 and @xmath180.7 , depending on the relative contributions of the base and extended components .",
    "in their simplest form adaf and cdaf self - similar spherical models invoke standard @xmath19 viscosity , a two - temperature thermal plasma , and a fixed ratio ( @xmath20 ) of magnetic to gas pressure .",

    "these sixteen llagns , listed in table  1 , were observed with the very large array ( vla ) at 5  ghz ( 6  cm ) , 8.4  ghz ( 3.6  cm ) , and 15  ghz ( 2  cm ) .",
    "the observations were made on september 5 and september 10 , 1999 , while the vla was in `` a''-configuration ( see thompson et al .",
    "each llagn observation was sandwiched between two observations of a nearby phase - calibrator with typical cycle times , in minutes , of 1 - 7 - 1 , 1 - 6 - 1 , and 2 - 7 - 2 , at 5  ghz , 8.4  ghz , and 15  ghz , respectively .",
    "the observations at the three frequencies are simultaneous to @xmath030 min for each llagn .",
    "data were calibrated and mapped using the aips software , following the standard procedures outlined in the aips cookbook .",
    "observations of 3c  147 and 3c  286 were used to set the 5  ghz flux - density scale , and observations of 3c  286 were used to set the 8.4  ghz and 15  ghz flux - density scales . the 15  ghz observation of 3c  286",
    "was made at a single ( 1.4 ) airmass , and all 15  ghz observations were made at airmasses of 1.06 to 1.4 , so the 15  ghz flux calibration error from elevation effects is expected to be less than 0.2% @xcite . for this reason we did not make elevation - dependent gain corrections to the 15  ghz data .",
    "the vla documentation suggests that the flux calibration at 5  ghz and 8.4  ghz should be accurate to 1%2% , and that at 15  ghz should be accurate to 3%5% ; we conservatively use the higher numbers as the respective @xmath72 errors . for sources with flux greater than 3  mjy",
    ", we were able to iteratively self - calibrate ( both phase - only and amplitude - and - phase ) and image the data so as to increase the signal - to - noise ratio in the final map .",
    "the root mean square noise in the final uniformly weighted maps was typically 100  @xmath73jy , 60  @xmath73jy , and 170  @xmath73jy at 5  ghz , 8.4  ghz , and 15  ghz , respectively .",
    "the resolution at these three wavelengths was typically 05 , 027 and 015 , respectively .",
    "we also made 15  ghz and 8.4  ghz maps with the same resolution ( 05 ) as the 5  ghz maps , by appropriately tapering the @xmath74 data .",
    "all sources except ngc  4168 at 15  ghz were clearly detected in initial ( non - self - calibrated ) maps .",
    "the 15  ghz observation of ngc  4168 was made during very bad weather , and we were able to make a noisy map only after self - calibration with a point - source model .",
    "the newly measured flux - densities are listed in table  1 .",
    "the 15  ghz data are noisy because of bad weather and high humidity . therefore the three nuclei for which we could not self - calibrate the 15  ghz data have true 15  ghz fluxes somewhere between the measured values and 3  mjy . for all but three of the objects ,",
    "the radio emission at all three frequencies is compact ; a gaussian fit to the source does not give a deconvolved size more than half a beam - size .",
    "the three sources with detected extended structure are all previously known to have such structure : ngc  4278 @xcite , ngc  4472 @xcite , and ngc  4486 ( m  87 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the unresolved emission dominates the extended emission in our maps of these three sources except in ngc  4472 , which has a very weak core .",
    "most nuclei have roughly similar fluxes in the full resolution 15  ghz maps and the 05 resolution tapered maps ( table  1 ) ; the same is true at 8.4  ghz . the peak flux - density in the 05 resolution , 5  ghz vla maps",
    "is @xmath60.82.1 times the total ( but not necessarily core ) flux in the central @xmath020  mas of the 5  ghz ( non - simultaneous ) vlba maps for all sources which were observed in our june 1997 and april 1999 vlba runs ( column 14 of table  1 ) .",
    "the variation of the core spectral index ( from the peak fluxes in matched resolution maps ) with black hole mass is shown in fig .",
    "[ figmdo_alpha]a .",
    "we have distinguished between black hole masses derived directly from stellar- , gas- , and maser - dynamics @xcite from those inferred from central velocity dispersions ( using the relationship derived by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and galaxy bulge masses ( using the relationship derived by * ? ? ?",
    "only ngc  3031 ( m  81 ) and ngc  4772 consistently show the highly inverted radio spectrum expected in adaf models with or without weak to moderately - strong outflows .",
    "the core radio emission from the latter galaxy is probably dominated by extended emission ( see above ) , and as discussed below the radio emission from the former is probably from a jet .",
    "apart from ngc  4472 , the elliptical galaxies have a similar spectral shape above and below 8.4  ghz .",
    "most of the non - ellipticals have a spectrum which falls more rapidly at frequencies above 8.4  ghz than below ( fig .  [ figmdo_alpha]b ) , with ngc 3718 and ngc 4258 being the exceptions .",
    "when high ( @xmath02 ) resolution 2 - 10  kev x - ray luminosities are available ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ratio of @xmath75l@xmath76 between x - ray and radio is @xmath77 , suggestive of strong outflows in an adaf scenario ( di matteo , carilli , & fabian 2001 ) .",
    "interestingly , this ratio is @xmath78100 for the seyfert  1s and @xmath30100 for the other nuclei .",
    "very low accretion rates ( perhaps due to convection or strong outflows ) may cause @xmath25 to fall close to 515  ghz for the objects in the sample .",
    "such a scenario is supported by the evidence for turnover frequencies in the 1030  ghz range for a few ellipticals @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , then eqn .  [ eqnnu_p ] implies lower values of @xmath25 for more massive black holes .",
    "that is , within our sample we would expect nuclei with less massive black holes to have more inverted spectra than nuclei with more massive black holes .",
    "however , even though we sample more than two orders of magnitude in @xmath42 , fig .",
    "1 does not support such a trend . therefore ,",
    "unless non - ellipticals have different micro - physical parameters , or higher accretion rates , or a different accretion mechanism , as compared to ellipticals , it is unlikely that a turnover frequency in the 515  ghz range is the cause of the observed flat radio spectrum in most of the sample . if @xmath79  ghz for most nuclei in the sample , then any inverted spectrum radio component must be dominated by other sources at 5  ghz and 8.4  ghz ( and perhaps even at 15  ghz ) .",
    "one potential source is non - thermal electrons within the adaf @xcite .",
    "significant emission from star - formation related processes can be ruled out as the radio core has a high brightness - temperature at 5  ghz , and at this wavelength most of the flux within the central 05 is also detected on mas - scales ( table  1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the observed distribution of spectral indices is consistent with the 515  ghz radio emission originating in synchrotron - emitting jets .",
    "whether or not an accretion flow contributes to the nuclear radio emission , the detections of what appear to be collimated pc - scale jets in the five llagns of table  1 with the highest core flux - ngc  3031 ( m  81 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and ngc  4552 ( m  89 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) - does indicate that synchrotron emission from jets is a significant contributor to the sub - arcsecond radio emission .",
    "in fact , in all three sample nuclei which have been comprehensively studied at high resolution in the radio , the radio flux from the jet dominates that from the unresolved `` core . '' in ngc  4486 the jet component within 30  mas ( 2.5  pc ) of the nucleus contributes three times the radio flux of the unresolved ( 1  mas x 0.2  mas ) `` core '' @xcite .",
    "given that this `` core '' continues to be further resolved at higher resolutions ( junor , biretta , & livio 1999 ) , and that the jet is a strong radio emitter on scales of 30  mas to 1 , the jet is certainly the dominant sub - arcsecond radio emitter . in ngc  3031 , which has a spectral shape consistent with an adaf model ,",
    "sub - mas multi - epoch observations reveal that the sub - parsec jet contributes at least three times the radio flux of the unresolved `` core '' @xcite .",
    "deep radio observations of ngc  4258 not only reveal a sub - parsec jet , but also indicate an absence of continuum emission from the putative location ( as traced by the water - vapour maser disk ) of the nucleus @xcite .    in the context of any low - luminosity spherical accretion model , the presence of outflows and the smaller radio luminosities attributable to the inflow both point to accretion rates at least an order of magnitude lower than than earlier predicted using adaf models ( e.g. 10@xmath8010@xmath81 ;",

    "a jet can also cause considerable disruption of the high - frequency radio emitting region ( @xmath82 ) of the inflow .",

    "for a moderately - strong outflow ( e.g. @xmath70 ) about 25% of the material accreted at 100@xmath85 is lost to the outflow by @xmath86 .",
