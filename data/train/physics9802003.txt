    "the aim of this work is to present more evidence that excitation spectra of complex open - shell atoms , and probably any other atom at sufficient excitation energies , display clear quantum chaotic features .",
    "this phenomenon is caused by strong mixing of many - electron excited states by the residual two - body coulomb interaction .",
    "it manifests in particular in a gaussian statistics of the @xmath0 amplitudes for these states .    since the time of bohr s hydrogen atom theory atoms were considered as perfectly regular dynamical systems .",
    "as the classical theory of chaos evolved it became apparent that highly excited atomic states in the rydberg range could become chaotic if an external field is applied @xcite , as long as the underlying classical motion is chaotic .",
    "on the other hand , it was also due to bohr that the notion of compound nuclei was introduced in physics .",
    "the behaviour of these highly excited nuclear states is essentially quantum - mechanical .",
    "nevertheless , they display a number of chaotic properties .",
    "for example , the statistics of their energy spectra show certain universal features , and transition amplitudes involving compound states obey gaussian statistics @xcite . to describe these properties",
    "it was suggested by wigner that the hamiltonian of a compound nucleus could be modeled by a random matrix , and different characteristics found by averaging over ensembles of such matrices ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the first insight into quantum chaotic properties of complex atoms was given by rosenzweig and porter @xcite who analyzed experimental spectra of some neutral atoms and showed that in heavy open - shell atoms the spectral statistics are similar to those of compound nuclei .",
    "that analysis was later extended and refined in @xcite .",
    "of course , the study of eigenvalues provides valuable information about the system . on the other hand",
    ", the spectral statistics observed in heavy open - shell atoms are similar to those of the hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field @xcite , or even a particle in a 2-dimensional classically ergodic billiard @xcite .",
    "however , the eigenstates of these quantum systems must be completely different , and it is clear that the eigenvalue statistics can not really tell us much about the origin of chaotic behaviour , or indeed the structure of the chaotic eigenstates .",
    "the first inquiry into the possibility of chaos in the eigenstates of complex atoms was done by b. chirikov @xcite .",
    "he studied configuration compositions of eigenstates of the ce atom using data from the tables @xcite , and came to the conclusion that the ` eigenfunctions are random superpositions of some few basic states ' .",
    "inspired by that work we conducted an extensive numerical study of the spectra and eigenstates of complex open - shell atoms , using the rare - earth atom of ce as an example @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to investigate many - body quantum chaos in a real system .",
    "we showed that atomic excited states are in fact similar to nuclear compound states and developed a statistical approach for analyzing their properties .    unlike eigenvalues ,",
    "the eigenfunctions are not observable directly . to probe the structure of the chaotic eigenstates one can look at the transition probabilities or matrix elements of some external perturbation coupling them to each other , or to regular , simple eigenstates ( like the ground state ) .",
    "the matrix elements involving chaotic eigenstates must have gaussian statistics .",
    "we showed that its main characteristics  the mean squared value of the matrix element between the chaotic multiparticle states ( compound states ) , can be calculated in terms of statistical parameters of the eigenstates and single - particle amplitudes and occupation numbers of the orbitals present in the compound states @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have chosen the quantity most easily accessible experimentally  the @xmath0 amplitudes .",
    "it also gives us an opportunity to look for experimental signatures of chaos in the ce atom using the work by bisson _",
    "et al _ @xcite , where over 200 line strengths were measured for transitions between a large number of levels within 3.5 ev of the ground state .",
    "it should be mentioned that there are many other possible atomic systems to search for quantum chaos , e.g. , in doubly excited states and inner - shell excitation spectra of alkaline - earth atoms @xcite , or even multiply excited states of light atoms @xcite .",
    "let us now recall briefly what chaotic many - electron atomic eigenstates are .",
    "suppose one uses a basis of some single - electron orbitals ( e.g. , the hartree - fock ones ) to construct many - electron basis states @xmath3 .",
    "the states @xmath4 can be taken as single - determinant states corresponding to certain configurations of a few valence electrons , or constructed from them through some coupling scheme to be of definite total angular momentum @xmath5 .",
    "the true atomic eigenstates @xmath6 and eigenvalues @xmath7 are obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix @xmath8 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath9 describe mixing of the basis states by the residual coulomb interaction . in the multi - electron excitation range the number of basis states @xmath3 formed by distributing several electrons among a few open orbitals is large . many of these states are nearly degenerate and the mean spacing between the basis state energies @xmath10 is likely to be smaller than the typical value of the off - diagonal matrix element @xmath11 . in this situation",
    "the basis states are strongly mixed together @xcite .",
    "apart from a few lowest levels , each of the eigenstates is a superposition of a large number of basis states . of course ,",
    "by a simple perturbation theory argument , the mixing must be weak for distant basis states ( large @xmath12 ) .",
    "the strong mixing takes place within a certain energy range @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mean level spacing , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is called the _ spreading width _ , since it characterizes the spread of the eigenstates to which a given basis state contributes noticeably .",
    "one can estimate the number of _ principal components _",
    ", i.e. those that contribute significantly to a given eigenstate ( [ a ] ) , as @xmath17 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath9 corresponding to the principal components have typical values @xmath18 .",
    "their statistics is close to that of independent random variables , and tends towards gaussian when the mixing is strong . in this case",
    "even the single - electron orbital occupancies are far from integer and only the total angular momentum , parity and the energy itself remain good quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "thus , we can talk about _ quantum chaos _ in the system .",
    "this situation is similar to that in compound nuclei and the corresponding chaotic eigenstates can be called atomic compound states .",
    "the model configuration interaction calculations performed for ce produced a value of @xmath19 ev , and demonstrated the existence of a dense spectrum of chaotic compound excited states with @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ev ) just few ev from the ground state @xcite .",
    "consider two chaotic many - body states ( compound states , for short ) that are superpositions of large numbers of basis states , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if the expansion coefficients @xmath9 are random , the matrix element of some operator @xmath24 @xmath25 is a sum of a large number of almost uncorrelated random items @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should expect that such matrix elements display gaussian statistics with zero mean .",
    "hence , the probability distribution of the matrix elements between compound states can be characterized by their mean squared value alone .",
    "if @xmath24 is a single - particle operator , e.g. , the electric dipole moment @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 are single - particle states ) , it is convenient to express its matrix elements in terms of the matrix elements of the density matrix operator @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 .    in @xcite and @xcite a statistical approach to calculation of mean squared matrix elements between compound states has been developed .",
    "it is first based on the assumption that contributions from different single - particle transitions @xmath32 in the matrix element ( [ mel ] ) are uncorrelated . the mean squared value is then given by @xmath33 where averaging is done over a number of compound states around @xmath34 and/or @xmath35 .",
    "the mean squared value of the density matrix operator @xmath36 is expressed in terms of the parameters of the compound states 1 and 2 ( i.e. their energies and spreading widths ) , and the average occupation numbers of the single - particle states @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    in a spherically symmetric system where the states 1 and 2 are characterized by their total angular momenta @xmath37 and projections @xmath38 , the wigner - eckhart theorem applies , and it is convenient to deal with the reduced matrix elements @xmath39 independent of the projections @xmath38 . for example , the mean squared value of the zero - rank reduced density matrix operator ( @xmath40 then ) is obtained in the following two forms @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the mean level spacings near the states 1 and 2 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the orbital occupation numbers , and @xmath45 is a `` finite - width @xmath46 function '' .",
    "it depends on the spreading widths @xmath47 of the compound states and on the energy difference @xmath48 between the transition frequency for the compound many - electron states @xmath49 and the frequency @xmath50 of the single - particle transition between the orbitals @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the function @xmath45 has a maximum at @xmath53 and describes the energy conservation for the compound states .",
    "its width is determined by the spreading widths @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ answ0 ] ) denote averaging of the occupation - number factors over the compound states 1 or 2 .",
    "note also that the exact form of the function @xmath56 depends of the spreading of the compound states over the basis components , i.e. on the `` shapes '' of the eigenstates . in the simplest approximation",
    "this spreading is described by the breit - wigner formula ( see numerical studies in @xcite ) and @xmath45 is also a breit - wigner profile @xmath57    to calculate the mean squared value of the @xmath0 amplitude we now need a formula for the reduced density matrix operator of the first rank .",
    "starting from the definition @xcite @xmath58 for @xmath59 ( linear polarization along the quantization axis ) and assuming that transitions between different magnetic sublevels @xmath60 are uncorrelated we can derive a formula for the mean square of ( [ rank1 ] ) , and then use it to obtain the mean - squared @xmath0 amplitude , @xmath61 analogous to the lower formula in eq .",
    "( [ answ0 ] ) , or an alternative form with @xmath62 and @xmath63 on the right - hand side .",
    "the factor @xmath64 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ answe1 ] ) is due to the fact that there are three final - state momenta @xmath65 accessible from a given @xmath66 by means of a dipole transition . in deriving this expression",
    "an additional assumption has been made that the occupancies of the @xmath67 and @xmath68 states are statistically independent , and the states with different @xmath60 within the same @xmath51 shell are equally populated .",
    "this supposition influences only the `` emptiness '' factors @xmath69 , which are close to unity anyway when the number of single - electron states available is much greater than the number of active electrons .",
    "the square of the reduced dipole matrix element @xmath70 is called the strength of the line @xmath71 , so eq .  ( [ answe1 ] ) allows one to estimate _",
    "mean line strengths _ for transitions involving compound states .",
    "it is interesting to note that the statistical theory expression ( [ answe1 ] ) satisfies the dipole sum rule @xcite ( in atomic units ) , @xmath72 is the number of active valence electrons included in the configuration space of the problem . to obtain this result",
    "one should replace summation over the final states @xmath73 with integration over @xmath74 , take into account that @xmath75 [ see eq .",
    "( [ bw ] ) ] , neglect the `` emptiness '' factor @xmath76 and use @xmath77 , and rely on the single - particle sum rules for the orbitals @xmath78 occupied in the initial state @xmath34 , @xmath79 numerical results for the ce atom ---------------------------------      cerium , @xmath80 , is the second of the lanthanide atoms .",
    "its electronic structure consists of the xe - like @xmath81 core and four valence electrons .",
    "the atomic ground state is described by the @xmath82 configuration with @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the origin of the extremely complex and dense excitation spectra of the rare - earth atoms is the existence of several open orbitals near the ground state , namely @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , or , in relativistic notation , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "these make a total of @xmath95 single - electron states . for ce with @xmath96 valence electrons",
    "there are about @xmath97 possible many - electron states constructed of them .",
    "if we allow for the two possible parities , about ten possible total angular momenta @xmath5 , and @xmath98 different projections ( another factor of ten ) , there will be still hundreds of energy levels within a given @xmath99 manifold .",
    "in the present work we perform relativistic configuration interaction calculations in the hartree - fock - dirac basis analogous to those in @xcite . in that work we limited ourselves to just 7 nonrelativistic configurations constructed of the @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 orbitals , for both odd and even states , which produced 260 and 276 states with @xmath83 and @xmath100 , respectively . to make the results more realistic",
    "we have extended the configuration basis set by 9 odd and 23 even nonrelativistic configurations .",
    "basically , the additional configurations were obtained by exciting one of the four electrons of an `` old '' configuration into the next orbital , e.g. , the lowest even @xmath101 configuration would produce @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 configurations . to keep the size of the configuration space reasonable we included only the configurations with mean energies within about 10 ev from the ce ground state .",
    "this increased the total number of @xmath106 and @xmath100 states to 862 and 1433 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath2 states have been chosen because these manifolds are among the most abundant .    as a result",
    ", the level density @xmath107 has increased greatly above 4 ev and become closer to that observed experimentally .",
    "of course , to be meaningful the level density must be averaged over some small energy interval to obtain a smooth function rather than a set of spikes .",
    "an alternative procedure is to look at the cumulative number of levels @xmath108 which we present in fig .",
    "[ fdens ] for @xmath109 states .",
    "each @xmath110 plot is a staircase of steps of the unit height occurring at successive excited state energies .",
    "the level density can be easily estimated from the slope of the @xmath110 plot .",
    "the experimental data for the 132 even levels with @xmath2 known from @xcite is shown by the solid - line staircase , and the energies are given with respect to either experimental , or calculated ground state energy .",
    "they can be compared with the dashed line that shows @xmath110 for our earlier small - basis calculation @xcite ( 276 states ) , and the dotted line for the present calculation ( 1433 states ) .",
    "the improvement is obvious , however , the agreement is not perfect .",
    "we believe that the remaining disagreement is not due to some missing configurations in the ci calculation , but rather due to an overall `` softening '' of the spectra due to screening of the coulomb repulsion between the valence electrons by the electrons of the core @xcite . in the ci language",
    "this effect is produced by the high - energy excitations of the valence electrons into the continuum together with the electron excitations from the core .",
    "two typical features can be observed in the spectra of complex atoms @xcite .",
    "the first clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fdens ] , is the rapid increase of the level density @xmath111 with energy @xcite .",
    "its origin is purely combinatorial  the larger the excitation energy , the greater the number of ways it can be distributed among a few single - particle excitations . in the independent - particle model",
    "this dependence is described by the following exponent @xcite : @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are some constants , and @xmath115 is the ground state energy of the system .",
    "this dependence also follows from the thermodynamic definition of the temperature , @xmath116\\ } /de$ ] , combined with the estimates of the average number of excited fermi particles , @xmath117 , and that of the excitation energy , @xmath118 .",
    "the experimental spectra of rare - earth atoms and their ions examined in @xcite are in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) .",
    "figure [ fdens ] shows that the calculated cumulative level number plot is fitted well by @xmath119 with @xmath120 ev@xmath121 , @xmath122 ev@xmath123 , and the `` ground state '' energy of the @xmath100 sequence @xmath115 shifted by 0.25 ev up from the true @xmath1 ground state of ce .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ rho ] ) gives a good overall fit of the calculated level density below 6 ev .",
    "the second feature typical for the spectra of complex many - body systems is level repulsion .",
    "it is a basic quantum mechanics fact that two levels with identical quantum numbers can not be degenerate if they are coupled by a non - zero matrix elements  they `` repel '' each other . in quantum chaotic systems this repulsion is characterized by the wigner level spacing distribution @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the nearest - neighbour level spacing normalized so that @xmath126 . equation ( [ wigner ] ) shows that the probability of finding small level spacings is indeed vanishingly small . as we pointed out in the introduction , spectral statistics do not tell much about the eigenstates of the system . however , eq .",
    "( [ wigner ] ) is still a good test for some possible hidden quantum numbers , e.g. , the total spin or orbital momentum , which might characterize atomic eigenstates besides @xmath127 .",
    "if these do exist , small level spacings ( `` degeneracies '' ) will be more abundant than predicted by eq .",
    "( [ wigner ] ) .",
    "these statistics were checked for many experimental @xcite and calculated @xcite complex atomic spectra , as well as for molecular vibronic spectra @xcite .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ fdens ] the level density changes significantly for the first 500 levels of the calculated spectrum . to analyze the distribution of the corresponding level spacings we use the analytical density fit @xmath128 to normalize the spacings :",
    "@xmath129 their distribution shown on the inset in fig .",
    "[ fdens ] is in reasonable agreement with the wigner formula .",
    "the deviations are probably due to the long - range fluctuations of the level density , not accounted for by the simple exponential ( [ rho ] ) . in the previous calculation @xcite , where only the lowest orbitals of each symmetry were included",
    ", we also observed the wigner distribution .",
    "when orbitals with higher principal quantum numbers become involved ( as seen from fig .",
    "[ fdens ] above 3.5 ev ) the spatial extent of the eigenstates increases .",
    "this should cause a decrease of the residual coulomb interaction between the electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "the level spacings also become smaller . as a result , the state mixing at these excitation energies remains strong , which is confirmed by the agreement with the wigner distribution , and the eigenstates are chaotic .",
    "our estimate of the number of principal components @xmath130 shows that it becomes even greater as the energy increases , in accord with the estimate @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ev , and the mean level spacing @xmath133 ev at @xmath134 ev ) .      in sec .",
    "[ mael ] we explained that matrix elements involving chaotic compound states should have gaussian statistics , and the mean squared value of the matrix elements could be estimated in terms of some average characteristics of the compound states . in this section",
    "we concentrate on the dipole matrix elements ( @xmath0 amplitudes ) @xmath135 between the 14 lowest states with @xmath136 and 80 consecutive @xmath100 states obtained numerically in our ci calculations of ce .",
    "we have chosen this energy region to cover the range explored in the experiment @xcite , where absolute values were derived for 228 of the most intense lines of neutral ce between 10706 and 22184 cm@xmath121 .",
    "of course , low - lying atomic states , e.g. , the ground state , have well - defined configuration composition and are not chaotic , hence , the @xmath0 amplitudes between them should not be distributed in any particular statistical way .",
    "however , the matrix elements ( [ m21 ] ) will become random ( and close to gaussian ) as soon as at least one of the states involved , the initial or the final , moves into the compound - state energy range and becomes a superposition of many random components .",
    "besides that , the mean squared value of the matrix element is expected to show some smooth secular variation with the energy of the states involved . for these reasons",
    "we skip the first 20 states with @xmath138 and analyze the statistics of the @xmath139 @xmath0 amplitudes for the following 80 even states by grouping them in bunches of twenty : 2140 , 4160 , 6180 , and 81100 , which correspond to the mean excitation energies of 2.49 , 2.95 , 3.40 , and 3.70 ev above the atomic ground state ( the mean energy of the lowest 14 odd states is 0.68 ev ) . thus , each plate in fig .",

    "two effects can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fcomp ] .",
    "first , the distributions of the matrix elements are indeed close to gaussian .",
    "second , the width of the distributions ( the mean squared value of the matrix elements ) varies with the energy of the even states .",

    "@xmath2 become very much chaotic at excitation energies of just 2 ev , i.e. from the 20th level up .",

    "the ground state of ce is described as @xmath82 , however , the dominant configuration among the 14 lowest odd states is @xmath151 , and we used it to calculate the transition energies .",
    "for example , the energy of the @xmath152 transition @xmath153 was determined as the difference between the average energies of the @xmath154 and @xmath151 configurations .",
    "physically , this corresponds to choosing a particular mean field close to that of the low - lying odd states of ce for calculation of the transition energies .",
    "it should be mentioned though that the results obtained with the hartree - fock frequencies @xmath155 were not too different .",

    "compared to the expected pt formula ( [ pt ] ) , there is a clear lack of small line strengths .",

    "it would be tempting to say that the excellent agreement between the pt curve and the histogram is a confirmation of the gaussian statistics of the @xmath0 amplitudes in ce .",
    "the value of @xmath167 would then indicate that about one half of all lines are missing in the experimental data .",

    "the experimentally observed 228 lines include transitions between levels with various total angular momenta between @xmath172 and 8 ( @xmath173 , of course ) whereas we have about 500 hundred lines with just @xmath174 in our calculation in the analogous energy range .",
    "this means that in @xcite only the strongest 10% or less of all lines have in fact been measured .",

    "in this work we have extended the configuration interaction approach of @xcite to calculate large numbers of eigenstates in ce . in agreement with our earlier studies",
    "the energy level statistics indicate that the simple configurational basis states are strongly mixed together by the residual electron interaction , and the only good quantum numbers in the spectrum are parity and the total angular momentum . the total orbital momentum @xmath184 and spin @xmath159 are not conserved due to the spin - orbit interaction , whose effect is dynamically enhanced , just as that of any other perturbation in a chaotic many - body system @xcite .",
    "the strong configuration mixing makes multielectron atomic eigenstates chaotic .",
    "this in turn results in a gaussian statistics of the matrix elements for chaotic atomic eigenstates ( compound states ) .",
    "this understanding is fully confirmed by our numerical calculations of the 1120 @xmath0 amplitudes between the 14 lowest @xmath83 states and 80 @xmath138 states above 2 ev .",
    "it is important that the parameter of the gaussian , the r.m.s .",
    "@xmath0 amplitude , varies slowly with the excitation energy .",
    "this effect should be taken into account when analyzing the statistics of the matrix elements .",
    "we also show that a statistical theory can be used to estimate mean squared matrix elements involving compound states .",
    "it enables one to express the answer in terms of the single - particle matrix elements and occupation numbers , and parameters of the compound states , namely the number of principal components and the spreading width .",
    "this approach has already been applied to calculation of matrix elements between compound states in nuclei @xcite .",
    "it could be useful in various other many - body systems , e.g. , atomic clusters or quantum dots , where direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix is not feasible because of a huge size of the hilbert space of the problem .",
    "an attempt has been made to analyze existing experimental data for the line strengths in ce @xcite .",
    "it appears that the statistics of the measured line strengths is compatible with the porter - thomas distribution , with allowance for the missing weak lines .",
    "however , the discrepancy between the calculated r.m.s . @xmath0 amplitudes and those inferred from the experimental data does not allow us to say that the existence of quantum chaos in the ce eigenstates has been confirmed experimentally . to make this statement one would have to do a much more complete survey and statistical analysis of the line strengths in the ce spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , this means that a comparison between the experimental and theoretical line strengths in ce is not yet possible , even at the level of their mean values .",
    "theoretically , to calculate precisely the dipole matrix elements between particular levels in the compound - state energy range of complex atoms like ce looks a prohibitively difficult problem . experimentally ,",
    "identification of specific lines in enormously complicated spectra is also a very difficult task .",
    "however , we would like to suggest that extraction of mean characteristics from the experiment and comparison with the corresponding theoretical estimates is a meaningful way of exploring such complex systems . as a result",
    ", one might hope to get a deeper insight into the existence of quantum chaos in many - body systems on the whole , and in complex open - shell atoms , in particular .",
