    "ultracold gaseous bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) provide a unique testbed with which to investigate the phenomenon of quantum turbulence and the more rudimentary realm of superfluid vortex dynamics @xcite .",
    "these systems provide an impressive degree of parameter manipulation unavailable in superfluid helium , the traditional context for studying quantum turbulence @xcite , with scope to control the particle interactions and potential landscape in both time and space .",
    "the typical size of these systems is only one or two orders of magnitude larger than the inter - vortex spacing , which in turn is another order of magnitude larger than the vortex core size .",
    "these compact length scales mean that the collective behaviour of vortices and their interaction with the background condensate is significant .",
    "the emergence of turbulent - like behaviour in the form of a vortex tangle was observed by henn _",
    "et al . _ in 2009 by oscillating a three - dimensional condensate @xcite .",
    "what s more , the experimentalist s handle over the confining potential enables crossover to two - dimensional quantum turbulence  @xcite : by tightly confining the trap geometry along one axis , such that the vortices closely embody point vortices @xcite , states of two - dimensional quantum turbulence have been recently reported  @xcite .    in the recent experiment of kwon _",
    "@xcite , a trapped , oblate bec was translated past a stationary , laser - induced obstacle . as is characteristic of superfluids , vortices and anti - vortices",
    "were nucleated into the condensate once the relative speed exceeded a critical value  @xcite .",
    "a state of two - dimensional quantum turbulence emerged , characterized by a disordered distribution of vortices .",
    "the authors monitored the number of vortices , revealing the dependence on the relative speed and the thermal relaxation of the vortices .",
    "they directly observed vortex collision events , characterized by a crescent - shaped depletion in the condensate density .",
    "furthermore , some vortex cores were seen to coalesce , evidence of vortex pair annihilation .    in this article",
    "we elucidate these experimental findings through mean - field simulations of the two  dimensional ( 2d ) gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , both at zero - temperature and in the presence of thermal dissipation , modelled through a phenomenological dissipation term in the gpe .",
    "notably , our simulations provide insight into the sign of the circulation of the vortices and the early - stage evolution , not accessible experimentally .",
    "we establish the key stages of the dynamics , from the initial nucleation of vortices and formation of a quasi - classical wake , through the rapid symmetry breaking and disorganization of the vortices , to the decay of the vortices by annihilation or passage out of the condensate .",
    "our approach gives excellent agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "in the experiment , a @xmath0na condensate with @xmath1 atoms was confined within a highly - oblate cylindrically symmetric harmonic trap @xmath2 $ ] , with axial frequency @xmath3 hz and radial frequency @xmath4 hz ( corresponding to an aspect ratio parameter @xmath5 ) and where @xmath6 denotes the atomic mass .",
    "a 2d mean - field description is strictly valid when the condition @xmath7 is satisfied , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the axial and radial harmonic oscillator lengths and @xmath10 is the _ s_-wave scattering length @xcite . for this experiment , @xmath11 ,",
    "i.e. the system remains 3d in nature .",
    "nonetheless , the dynamics of the vortices is essentially 2d because of the suppression of kelvin waves in the @xmath12-direction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will adopt a 2d description throughout this work and show that it is sufficient to capture the experimental observations .",
    "it is worth noting that in the @xmath13 plane the condensate closely approximates a thomas - fermi ( inverted parabola ) density profile with radius @xmath14 .",
    "we parameterize the condensate by a 2d wavefunction @xmath15 ; the condensate density distribution follows as @xmath16 .",
    "the wavefunction satisfies the 2d gpe : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the chemical potential of the condensate and @xmath19 characterizes the effective 2d nonlinear interactions arising from _ s_-wave atomic collisions .",
    "we solve the gpe on a @xmath20 grid using a fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the vortex core size is characterized by the healing length @xmath21 ; at the condensate centre this has the value @xmath22 m .",
    "the grid spacing is @xmath23 in both @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and we have verified that reducing the grid spacing has no effect on our results .    following the experiment ,",
    "the total potential acting on the condensate @xmath26 is the above harmonic trap plus a static gaussian - shaped obstacle potential @xmath27}$ ] , located at the origin , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 m .",
    "the initial ground - state bec is obtained by solving the gpe in imaginary time with enforced norm @xmath1 . at @xmath30 the harmonic trap",
    "is centered at @xmath31 m .",
    "the trap is translated towards the left , at speed @xmath32 , over a distance of @xmath33 m ; to smooth this speed curve we additionally include a linear acceleration / deceleration over @xmath34ms at the start / end , which is included as part of the @xmath35 m translation . once the trap is at rest , the obstacle amplitude @xmath36 is ramped down to zero over @xmath37s .",
    "following removal of the obstacle , we determine the number of vortices in the system @xmath38 ( performed by identifying locations where the condensate possesses a @xmath39 singularity in the phase ) .",
    "we limit our search to @xmath40 percent of the thomas - fermi radius ( centred on the centre - of - mass to account for sloshing motion ) ; by avoiding the low density periphery we avoid artifacts from ghost vortices and match closely what is performed experimentally ( since vortices close to the edge are not detected due to low signal - to - noise  @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : n_vv ] we plot @xmath38 versus the translation speed @xmath32 .",
    "we see the same _ qualitative _ form between our simulations ( red circles ) and the experiment ( black crosses ) : above a critical speed @xmath41mm / s vortices enter the system , nucleated by the relative motion between the obstacle and the superfluid , and for @xmath42 the growth in @xmath38 is initially rapid but tails off for @xmath43 .",
    "quantitatively , however , the gpe overestimates @xmath38 .",
    "one can expect that thermal dissipation , not accounted for in the gpe , will act to reduce the number of vortices in the system .",
    "we introduce the effects of such dissipation via the addition of phenomenological dissipation , @xmath44  @xcite , which enters the gpe  ( [ eq : gpe ] ) by replacing @xmath45 on the left hand side by @xmath46 .",
    "this term induces the decay of excitations ; for single vortices this manifests in them spiraling out of the trapped condensate  @xcite .",
    "we choose a small value @xmath47 so as to model the experiment in its very coldest realization of @xmath48nk and enforce the norm throughout the dissipative simulations so as to emulate the experiment ( for which no significant loss of atom number was observed ) .    with this dissipation",
    "the data for @xmath38 becomes reduced , bringing it closely in line with the experimental data .",
    "experimental limitations in resolving and counting vortices may also contribute to the over - estimate of @xmath38 from the gpe .",

    "each point is averaged over @xmath49 ms once the obstacle amplitude reaches @xmath50 . for comparison ,",
    "the speed of sound in the center of the bec is @xmath51 mm / s . ]",
    "we now examine in detail the evolution of the condensate , charting its dynamics from the initial stage ( when the harmonic trap translation begins ) to the intermediate and final stages ( randomization and decay of the vortices ) .",
    "we see the same qualitative evolution with and without dissipation , and for all velocities exceeding @xmath52 . for the purposes of illustration",
    ", we focus on an example with dissipation and a translation speed @xmath53mm / s .",
    "figure [ fig : denssnapshots ] shows the condensate density at various times . at the start of the simulation ( @xmath30 ) the condensate has a smooth circular density profile , with a density depression due to the obstacle . later vortices appear as small dots of low density ; superimposed red / blue markers tag vortices of positive / negative circulation .      to initiate the dynamics ,",
    "the harmonic trap is translated to the left .",
    "this is performed sufficiently rapidly that the condensate does not adiabatically follow the trap minimum , but rather begins a sloshing motion in the trap ; the centre - of - mass of the bec oscillates at the trap frequency and the bec undergoes a quadrupolar shape oscillation . as the bec sloshes first to the left , its speed increases . when the local fluid velocity exceeds the speed of sound @xcite , vortices nucleate at the poles of the obstacle ( where the local fluid velocity is the greatest ) and are washed downstream ( to the left ) .",
    "the pattern of vortices nucleated by a moving obstacle in a superfluid depends , in general , on the speed , shape and size of the obstacle  @xcite . during the initial evolution vortices of negative and positive circulation",
    "are created near each pole in an irregular manner , sometimes with alternating circulation ; other times several vortices of the same circulation appear . in our case ,",
    "the rate of vortex nucleation is sufficiently high that the vortices interact strongly with each other , collectively forming macroscopic clusters of negative and positive vortices downstream of the object ( @xmath54ms ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the wakes in classical viscous fluids past cylindrical obstacles @xcite . during this early stage ,",
    "vortices of opposite circulation may become very close and annihilate ( i.e. undergo a 2d reconnection ) , leaving behind density ( sound ) waves .",
    "the condensate then sloshes to the right ; this motion not only carries the existing vortices to the opposite ( right ) side of the obstacle but nucleates further vortices . as the condensate s sloshing mode is damped by the dissipation , the relative speed of the obstacle decreases and the vortex nucleation pattern changes : like - signed vortices are generated near each pole , forming symmetric classical  like wakes  @xcite .",
    "this effect leads to further clustering of like - signed vortices ( @xmath55ms ) .",
    "as the condensate continues to slosh , more vortices nucleate into the system .",
    "it must be stressed that , up to these early times ( @xmath56ms ) , the vortex distribution remains symmetric about the @xmath24 axis . without the dissipation term in the gpe , the sloshing mode initially decays while the obstacle is present but then persists with constant amplitude once the obstacle is removed .",
    "if dissipation is included then the sloshing mode continues to decay .",
    "( color online ) snapshots of the condensate density , for a translational speed @xmath53mm / s and in the presence of dissipation ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the obstacle is completely removed at @xmath58s .",
    "the field of view in each subfigure is of size @xmath59m@xmath60 ^ 2 $ ] and shifted along the @xmath24-axis so as to best display the condensate .",
    "vortices with positive ( negative ) circulation are highlighted by red circles ( blue triangles ) . ]      in the presence of the obstacle and the sloshing mode , vortices continually nucleate and their spatial distribution remains approximately symmetric about the @xmath24 axis . at later times ( @xmath61ms )",
    "this symmetry breaks and the vortices evolve into a completely disorganised , apparently random configuration with no significant clustering of like - signed vortices .",
    "this random distribution of vortices is consistent with the experimental observations @xcite ; following this we also classify the system as one of quantum turbulence .",
    "besides vortices , the condensate contains also collective modes and an energetic , disordered sound field , with this spatial range of excitations further indicative of two - dimensional quantum turbulence @xcite .",
    "( note that the typical characteristic diagnostics of steady - state 2d quantum turbulence , e.g. power - law energy spectra and the inverse energy cascade , are not appropriate here since the system is not continuously driven and does not reach steady state . )",
    "the vortex randomization is driven by the growth of numerical noise .",
    "we have repeated our results in the presence of imposed noise ( amplitude @xmath62 , as described elsewhere @xcite ) and find the qualitative dynamics to be unchanged ( although , as one would expect , the vortex randomization occurs at a slightly earlier time ) .",
    "this noise serves to model the natural fluctuations that arises in a realistic experimental scenario , e.g. due to thermal and quantum atomic fluctuations , electromagnetic noise , vibrations , etc .",
    "it is interesting to note the obstacle is still in the system at this point , nucleating vortices in a symmetrical manner .",
    "the disorganised vortices already in the system create a velocity field which quickly mixes newly created vortices nucleated at the poles of the obstacle .",
    "visual inspection , confirmed by a clustering - detection algorithm  @xcite , shows no significant clusters beyond this stage of the evolution . by the time the obstacle is removed",
    "the vortex configuration is essentially random , but the number of positive and negative vortices stays approximately equal .",
    "it is important to remark that , without detecting the sign of the vortex circulation , we could not reach these conclusions .",

    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : denssnapshots ] that , following the removal of the obstacle , the number of vortices ( @xmath38 ) depletes .",
    "indeed , one expects that the condensate will decay towards its vortex  free , time  independent ground state . to quantify the vortex generation and decay , fig .",
    "[ fig : n_vtime ] plots @xmath38 versus time .",
    "the onset of vortex nucleation is at around @xmath63ms ; this is the time taken for accelerating condensate to exceed the speed of sound at the poles of the object . at first",
    "@xmath38 grows steeply , as vortices ( around 40 - 60 ) are rapidly driven into the system .",
    "subsequently , @xmath38 grows more slowly ; vortices continue to be nucleated from the obstacle but vortices undergo annihilation or move into low density regions where they are not detected .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath38 are amplified , particularly at early times , by the shape oscillations of the condensate , which carry vortices in and out of the detection radius .",
    "as the obstacle is removed at @xmath64s , the surrounding condensate fills the low density area .",
    "vortices ( including some outside of the detection radius ) move inwards with the flow , causing @xmath38 to peak .",

    "we are able to independently count the number of vortices which drift out and the number which annihilate .",
    "we decompose the number of vortices according to @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the initial number of vortices ( when the obstacle is removed ) , @xmath66 is the cumulative number of vortices which have drifted out of the condensate and @xmath67 is the cumulative number which have undergone pair annihilation .",
    "the contribution of both vortex drifting and annihilation to the overall decay of @xmath38 is depicted by the coloured regions in fig .",

    "in contrast , in the presence of dissipation , vortices continue to drift out over time , consistent with dissipative dynamics of single vortices @xcite .",

    "our simulations yield crescent - shaped density features as seen in the experiment , but these features are not uniquely formed by annihilation events - they may also result from from two ( or more ) vortices in close proximity .",
    "information about the condensate phase is thus crucial to distinguish the nature of these observed structures . in this direction ,",
    "an approach has recently been proposed for the experimental detection of quantized vortices and their circulation in a 2d bec @xcite .",
    "it is evident from the snapshots in figure 2 that the initial translation of the condensate past the obstacle generates not just vortices but also shape excitations , sound waves ( low - amplitude density waves ) , and high - amplitude density waves .",
    "these additional excitations will heat the condensate and modify the subsequent turbulent dynamics in a highly nonlinear and complicated manner . while reducing the translational speed",
    "reduces this disruption , this also reduces the number of vortices . a less disruptive and more efficient ( higher rate of vortex nucleation ) means to generate vortices may be provided by employing a laser - induced obstacle with _ elliptical _ , rather than circular , cross - section ( attainable through cylindrical beam focusing ) .",
    "repeating our simulations with such an elliptical obstacle @xmath83}$ ] with arbitrary ellipticity @xmath84 ( the short / long axis being parallel / perpendicular to the flow ) confirms the same qualitative behaviour as for homogeneous systems @xcite : the ellipticity acts to reduce the critical superfluid velocity and , for a given flow speed , increase the rate of vortex nucleation . to illustrate the merits of the elliptical obstacle , in fig .",
    "6 we depict snapshots of the condensate dynamics for ellipticity @xmath84 and a translational speed of @xmath85mm / s . despite a lower translational speed ,",
    "the number of vortices generated by the time the obstacle is removed is almost identical to the circular example of fig .",
    "3 . as a consequence of the reduced translational speed , the condensate disruption is visibly reduced .",
    "it is also worth noting that the elliptical obstacle promotes the formation of clusters of like - signed vortices ( see intermediate time ) , and thus may facilitate future exploration of coherent vortex structures .",

    "compared to the corresponding snapshots in figure 2 , the elliptical obstacle generates as many final vortices but at a lower translational speed and with reduced condensate disruption . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the recent experimental creation and decay of vortices within a bec  @xcite is well described by simulations of the 2d gpe with phenomenological dissipation ( despite the 3d nature of the system ) .",
    "theoretical access to the condensate phase , and thus the circulation of the vortices , promotes our understanding of the dynamics . in the early stages of translation of the obstacle , a quasi - classical wake of vortices forms behind it ,",
    "before symmetry breaking causes disorganisation of the vortices . after the obstacle is removed , the vortices decay in a manner which is both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the two mechanisms proposed by kwon _",
    "_ , i.e. loss of vortices at the condensate edge due to thermal dissipation and vortex - antivortex annihilation events within the condensate .",
    "we confirm the occasional appearance of crescent - shaped density features , resulting either from the proximity of vortex cores or from a sound pulse which follows a vortex - antivortex reconnection . finally , we propose that a moving _ elliptical",
