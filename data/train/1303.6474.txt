    "the arrival of high resolution observations , of the order of microseconds of arc , will allow us soon to observe the origin of extragalactic jets and specially the less distant ones like the m87 .",
    "these data should tip the balance in favor of one of the two main kinds os models .",
    "the first ones situate the origin of the jet close to the interior of the accretion disk , near the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) . while the second ones consider that the jet originates inside the ergosphere of the kerr black hole ( bh ) situated at the centre of the galaxy , for instance proposed in ( williams 1995 , 2004 ) and ( gariel et al .",
    "2010 ; pacheco et al .",
    "2012 ) .    the model ( gariel et al . 2010 ; pacheco et al . 2012 ) is based on the unbound particle geodesics leaving the kerr bh ergosphere .",
    "these particles are produced by a penrose process ( penrose 1969 ) inside the ergosphere and , while ejected , follow asymptotic geodesics parallel to the axis of symmetry @xmath1 at a radial distance @xmath2^{1/2 } , \\label{1a}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the carter constant , @xmath0 the bh spin and @xmath4 the particle energy .",
    "there is a limited number of discrete values @xmath5 for which the energy @xmath4 of the particles tends to infinity , while near the neighborhood of each of these values the energy diminishes steeply .",
    "this permits modeling a thin jet highly energetic and collimated .",
    "admitting that the penrose process is the source of production of particles building the jet , it is reasonable to suppose that its frequency increases proportionally to the ergospheric volume , which is the only region where it can take place .",
    "hence , the larger is the ergospheric volume the larger is the amount of particles produced to take part of the jet , and the more powerful becomes the jet .",
    "the trace of the ergosphere in the plane @xmath6 is a closed curve , with equation @xmath7 \\left ( 1-\\frac{\\rho } { a}\\right ) ,   \\label{1}\\ ] ] depending only on the parameter @xmath0 , the kerr bh angular momentum per unit mass and where we normalized its mass @xmath8 .",
    "the surface @xmath9 inside this curve can be calculated from @xmath10 \\left ( 1-\\frac{\\rho } { a}\\right ) \\right\\ } ^{1/2}d\\rho ,   \\label{2}\\ ] ] which , after integration , produces @xmath11 -\\frac{1}{% 4a}(1 - 2a^{2})(1-a^{2})^{1/2}.   \\label{3}\\ ] ] we can plot the function @xmath12 , figure 1 , for @xmath13 $ ] and obtain the value of @xmath0 where @xmath9 is maximal : @xmath14 the corresponding trace of the ergosphere , ( [ 1 ] ) , for @xmath0 given by ( [ 4 ] ) , generating the maximal ergospheric volume , is plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the first observation of an extragalactic jet dates back to the year 1918 and concerned the one produced by m87 , being very long and powerful .",
    "currently , the m87 nucleus distance is estimated at @xmath15 mpc ( blakeslee et al .",
    "2009 ) and the mass of its central bh to be @xmath16 ( gebhardt et al . 2011 ) .",
    "its relativistic jet extends for hundreds of kpcs before ending in large radiolobes .    in the framework of the model discussed in ( gariel et al .",
    "2010 ; pacheco et al .",
    "2012 ) , it is natural , according to the results of the section 2 , to expect that the most energetic jets produced by a kerr bh of mass @xmath17 are obtained for @xmath0 given by ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "it is natural to assume too that the jet produced by m87 fits into this model .",
    "we call the attention that this value for @xmath0 is consistent with the few evaluations of the m87 bh spin obtained to date , like @xmath18 in ( wang et al .",
    "2008 ) , and more recently @xmath19 in ( li et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "hence we look for particles moving along unbounded geodesics with high energy , we take @xmath20 , produced in the ergoregion , which means , in 2d , produced between the ergosphere and the event horizon situated on the @xmath1 axis .",
    "these particles move asymptotically parallel to the @xmath1 axis with @xmath21 when @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , there are other geodesics , near these perfectly collimated ones , that asymptotically behave @xmath23 when @xmath22 , however they are not very divergent , i.e. , they satisfy @xmath24 for a long distance along the axis .",
    "now we need to determine the parameter @xmath5 . in order to do this",
    "we consider the recently obtained high resolution data ( doeleman et al .",
    "the data presented in ( doeleman et al .",
    "2012 ) opens a new era of resolutions never before achieved , which are of the order tens of microseconds of arc .",
    "hopefully soon it can be expected resolutions even better , of microseconds of arc . with these observations the models considering jets produced by the accretion disk near the isco ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) and models with jets leaving the ergosphere ( williams 1995 , 2004 ; gariel et al .",
    "2010 ; pacheco et al . 2012 ) will be discriminated . among these models",
    "the one that is based only on gravity to explain the genesis of jets considers that the kerr spacetime has the essential features to explain their formation , acceleration and collimation ( gariel et al .",
    "2010 ; pacheco et al .",
    "other fields , excepting the gravitational , like the magnetic field are no more that a complement for their formation .    through interferometry by using the vlbi array and by choosing a frequency of the order 229 ghz ( or wave length 1.3 mm ) allowing a good transparency up to the core of the order of @xmath17 .",
    "we precise this point since it is not always understood in this way .",
    "for instance in ( hada et al .",
    "2011 ) it is defined centred transverse to the axis @xmath1 .",
    "hence there are `` cores '' for each altitude @xmath1 according to its observed frequency ] of the galaxy and with unprecedent resolution of the order of @xmath25 as corresponding * * , * * for a distance 16.7@xmath260.6 mpc , to a length of the order of 5.5 @xmath27 , doeleman et al .",
    "( doeleman et al . 2012 ) evaluated the maximal diameter of the emerging jet at @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the schwarzschild bh radius .",
    "then , by admitting the validity of the model by blandford and znajek ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) , they assume that the jet starts at the isco of the accretion disk and put @xmath30 this assumption implies too that the origin of this observation is on the plane of isco , i.e. the equatorial plane @xmath31 . the apparent radius of isco , plotted in ( doeleman et al .",
    "2012 ) as a function of the spin @xmath0 ( see figure 3 in ( doeleman et al . 2012 ) ) , is the intrinsic radius corrected by the effect of gravitational lensing caused by its proximity to the core endowed with a kerr bh . in this figure , the horizontal line representing @xmath32 intersects the prograde radius of isco , which allows to evaluate the spin of the bh as @xmath33 and to show that only the prograde part is viable .",
    "we observe that the so obtained value of @xmath0 is inside the limit of ( wang et al .",
    "2008 ) , but outside the limit of ( li et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "now we interpret the same result in the light of the model given by ( gariel et al .",
    "2010 ; pacheco et al .",
    "2012 ) . instead of considering the `` apparent '' distances ,",
    "we deduct the lensing and consider the `` intrinsic '' distances @xmath34 by observing that the curve @xmath35 , figure 3 , roughly is translated downwardly about 1.3 from the @xmath36 given in figure 3 in ( doeleman et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "writing these quantities in terms of weyl coordinates , given by ( 1 ) in ( pacheco et al .",
    "2012 ) , we obtain @xmath37^{1/2}=[(r_{jetapp}-2.3)^{2}-(1-a^{2})]^{1/2}. \\label{8}\\ ] ]    now we can plot the curves @xmath38 for values in the range @xmath39 $ ] , which are given in figure 4 .        in particular , from the central curve ,",
    "corresponding to the apparent radius @xmath40 , we deduce for the maximal volume of the ergoregion ( [ 4 ] ) @xmath41 we abandon the hypothesis ( [ 6 ] ) assumed by @xcite and we replace it by @xmath42 this allows us to obtain the unbound @xmath5-asymptotic geodesic , ( see the lower curve , asymptotically parallel to the @xmath1-axis , in figure 5 ) , with parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 after numerical integration of ( 21 ) given by ( gariel et al . 2010 ) and initial conditions ( i.c . )",
    "@xmath46 which are well inside the ergosphere ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "observations concerning the geometry of the jet far from the core of the galaxy m87 have been performed first by junor et al .",
    "( junor et al . 1999 ) and being interpreted , like with the observations of doeleman et al .",
    "( doeleman et al . 2012 ) , by assuming the validity of the model of blandford and znajek ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "more recent observations , asada and nakamura ( asada & nakamura 2012 ) , confirm and specify the data obtained by junor et al junor et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the fact that we can interpret the observations obtained by doeleman et al .",
    "( doeleman et al . 2012 ) in the light of model ( pacheco et al . 2012 ) , induces us to ask if it can say something about its geometrical structure far from the core . to answer this question",
    "we confront the fittings suggested by asada & nakamura ( asada & nakamura 2012 ) to the geodesics studied in the model ( pacheco et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "asada & nakamura ( asada & nakamura 2012 ) observe an important changing of the jet slope after a certain altitude of the order @xmath47 , near of the bondi radius , indicating a divergent tendency . from these observations they established the following best fitting laws . for @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath49 and for @xmath50 $ ] ,",
    "@xmath51 where @xmath52 is called the parabolic type , and @xmath53 the conical type .",
    "we plot these curves in figure 5 ( see the two straight lines framed by the two geodesics ) .",
    "we seek to confront them with geodesics of the model ( gariel et al .",
    "2012 ; pacheco et al .",
    "2012 ) .    to keep continuity with the previous situation , near the core ,",
    "studied in section 4 , we keep the parameters values @xmath20 and @xmath45 to look for unbound geodesics , not asymptotic to @xmath5 , by numerical integration of equation ( 21 ) given in ( gariel et al .",
    "2010 ) , for different i.c .",
    "inside the ergosphere .",
    "we plot in fig .",

    "\\{@xmath54 , @xmath55 } and \\{@xmath56 , @xmath57 } respectively , which frame the two precedent best fits .",
    "the initial parts of these geodesics can be also viewed in figure 2 , where they frame a set of various geodesics ( not represented in the figure 5 , for the sake of clarity ) obtained for intermediate initial conditions , all inside the ergosphere .",
    "the `` internal '' geodesic starts above , very close to , the geodesic asymptotic to @xmath58 defined in ( [ 11 ] ) , and later diverges .",
    "the flow of geodesics located between the external one and the internal one diverge also , forming an outer shell , distinct of the perfectly collimated geodesic ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "there is evidence that the jets produced by blazars , are constituted of an external envelope , called sheath , and of an interior thin beam ( giroletti et al .",
    "2004 ; de villiers et al .",
    "2005 ; xie et al .",
    "these features appear naturally in our purely gravitational model .",
    "we can see on figure 5 that the `` conical '' fit ( 13 ) is in good agreement with the `` internal '' geodesic ( and those close to it ) , the agreement seeming even extend to lower altitudes , up to @xmath59 where the fit is however not consistent with the observations .",
    "in contrast , the `` parabolic '' fit ( [ 12 ] ) does not seem able to be equated with any single geodesic of the flow .",
    "the flow intersects the fit .",
    "that should be interpreted by noting that the successive points emitting the observed radiations belong to the outer portion of the jet .",
    "thus , there is an erosion of the width of the jet during its upward motion , mainly due to its friction with the ism .",
    "this friction is greater outside , where the density of the ism is greater , because the centrifugal force due to the bh rotation drags it outside . without this erosion effect ,",
    "the external geodesic would remain the external part of the jet which would remain parallel to the conical fit from @xmath60 ( or even before ) , as it can be seen on figure 5 .",
