    "exotic superconductivity with high-@xmath6 has been often discovered in doped layered compounds , such as cuprates@xcite , @xmath10-@xmath11ncl ( @xmath11=zr , hf)@xcite , and iron pnictides@xcite .",
    "recently , materials with bis@xmath0 layers have attracted much attention as a new family of layered superconductors .",
    "superconductivity was first reported in bi@xmath12s@xmath12o@xmath13@xcite ( @xmath14 k ) , followed by @xmath9o@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 ( @xmath9=la , ce , pr , nd and yb)@xcite , where the maximum @xmath6 reaches @xmath1510 k around @xmath7=0.5 for @xmath9=la .",
    "a characteristic crystal structure common to these materials is the bis@xmath0 layers consisting of the bi and s ions positioned alternately on the square lattice , which are separated by insulating blocking layers .",
    "the superconductivity has been believed to reside in the bis@xmath0 layer , when electron - type carriers are doped . for the @xmath9o@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 compounds , for instance ,",
    "the partial chemical substitution of o ions with f ions in the blocking layer allows the tuning of electron concentration in the bis@xmath0 layer and hence the critical temperature .",
    "such a stacking structure with mixed anions is reminiscent of so - called 1111-type fe - based superconductors.@xcite the variety of the blocking layer has been rapidly increasing , which includes sr@xmath16la@xmath16fbis@xmath0@xcite , la@xmath17obis@xmath0 ( @xmath18=ti , zr , hf , and th)@xcite , and bi@xmath13o@xmath0s@xmath13@xcite .",
    "theoretically , the undoped bis@xmath0-based material was predicted to be a band insulator .",
    "first - principles calculation suggested that the conduction band primarily consists of bi 6@xmath19 and 6@xmath20 orbitals arising from the bis@xmath0 layer , hybridized with s 3@xmath4 orbitals.@xcite assuming electron doping within a rigid - band scheme , the two - orbital model was suggested as a minimal model that considers only the bi 6@xmath4 orbitals as the relevant bands crossing the fermi surface.@xcite it was predicted that the topology of the fermi surface varies depending on the carrier concentration . in particular , hole pockets appear around the @xmath21 ( 0,0 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath22,@xmath22 ) points , when the doping level is increased up to @xmath150.5 .",
    "there , the fermi surfaces exhibit nesting and the associated spin fluctuation was proposed as a candidate of the superconducting pairing.@xcite on the other hand , some theoretical works indicated the electron - phonon coupling as another pairing mechanism@xcite , which is enhanced in the vicinity of the ferroelectric and/or charge - density - wave transitions@xcite .",
    "however , this has not been supported by experiments yet.@xcite    the superconducting phase diagram was experimentally revealed for @xmath9o@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 ( @xmath9=la , ce , and nd).@xcite except for the difference in @xmath6 , the overall features of variation in @xmath6 are similar for all the compounds ; a broad dome - shaped superconducting phase insensitive to the carrier density manifests itself around @xmath7=0.5 .",
    "however , the behavior of @xmath6 around the phase boundary to a non - superconducting phase has been still ambiguous",
    ". the carrier concentration above which the value of @xmath6 is non - zero appears to significantly differ depending on the materials ; it is approximately @xmath7=0.1 for @xmath9=la , whereas @xmath7=0.25 for @xmath9=ce .",
    "there have been also several complicated transport properties in addition to the emergence of the superconductivity . for lao@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 , while the resistivity slightly decreases with increasing @xmath7 up to 0.2 , it starts to steeply increase with further increasing @xmath7 and exhibits semiconducting behavior above @xmath7=0.5.@xcite for ceo@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 , on the other hand , the pristine compound is a bad metal and the resistivity monotonically increases with increasing @xmath7.@xcite    such a puzzling behavior may be attributed to the change in band structure via the partial substitution of f ions for o ions . it was recently suggested that the band gap is substantially enlarged by fluorine doping , since the top of the valence band mainly originates from o 2@xmath4 orbitals , which tends to sink as fluorine is doped.@xcite to reveal the intrinsic dependence of @xmath6 on the carrier density , it is essential to afford the carriers to the bis@xmath0 layer without modifying the original band structure .",
    "for this purpose , we have here focused on the recently - synthesized srfbis@xmath0 as a pristine compound.@xcite importantly , a first - principles calculation predicted the top of the valence band consists mainly of the s 3@xmath4 orbitals , where the density of states of the sr and f orbitals in the blocking layer is negligibly small .",
    "this would provide an ideal arena to realize the rigid - band carrier doping into the bis@xmath0 layer by substituting sr ions with la ones .",
    "very recently , the superconductivity was actually discovered for sr@xmath16la@xmath16fbis@xmath0@xcite , which has put a strong emphasis upon the importance of the extensive study about the dependence on carrier concentration .    in this study",

    "we discuss these superconducting properties in comparison with the li - intercalated zrncl compound .",

    "we have investigated the detailed electronic phase diagram and the superconducting properties for the electron - doped sr@xmath1la@xmath2fbis@xmath0 layered compounds by synthesizing the polycrystalline samples with la concentration ( @xmath7 ) systematically changed from 0 to 0.6 .",
    "characterization using the powder x - ray diffraction and x - ray absorption spectroscopy has revealed that la substitution is successful up to @xmath7=0.6 and it effectively affords an electron into the bis@xmath0 layer .",
    "the pristine compound is a band insulator and the resistivity systematically decreases with increasing @xmath7 . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the system exhibits metallic behavior except for the anderson localization effect , where the superconducting transition manifests itself at low temperatures .",
    "the bulk superconductivity was confirmed by the large diamagnetic response and clear jump in specific heat .",
    "the variation in @xmath6 is distinctive ; it gradually increases with decreasing the carrier concentration toward the insulating phase and suddenly disappears at the critical concentration ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the obtained electronic phase diagram is characterized by the doping - induced insulator - superconductor transition with a steep phase boundary around @xmath7=0.4 .",
    "this markedly contrasts to the broad superconducting dome reported for the @xmath9o@xmath1f@xmath2bis@xmath0 compounds , which indicates the blocking layer strongly affects the superconducting transition .",
    "considering that all the bands arising from the sr and f orbitals are away from the fermi energy , the present phase diagram would purely reflect the effects of rigid - band - like electron doping into the bis@xmath0 layer .",
    "the thermodynamic measurements have furthermore suggested that the superconducting coupling strength is enhanced , as the phase boundary to the insulator is approached .",
    "the observed superconducting features resemble those for li - intercalated zrncl superconductors , where the transition to the superconducting phase takes place by as small as 6% doping . on the other hand ,",
    "the small positive hall coefficient as well as small negative thermopower was observed for the normal state of the present compound , which indicates that the topology of the fermi surface significantly changes from that in the low - carrier density regime .",
    "therefore , the sr@xmath1la@xmath2fbis@xmath0 system can be regarded as a layered superconductor derived from a doped band insulator , characterized by hole - like fermi surfaces coexistent with electron - type ones .",
