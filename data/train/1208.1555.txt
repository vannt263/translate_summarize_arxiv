    "the quantum aspects of correlations in composite systems are a key issue in quantum information theory @xcite .",

    "the entanglement is not the only type of quantum correlation . to generally quantify the quantumness of correlations contained in bipartite systems , ollivier and zurek",

    "it is largely accepted that the total correlations contained in quantum states can be described by quantum mutual information which is a sum of the quantum discord and classical correlation given by henderson and vedral @xcite .",
    "quantum discord has received much attention in theoretical studies @xcite . by means of the thermodynamics of correlations ,",
    "quantum discord can exhibit signatures of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",

    "the robustness of quantum discord is beneficial for the realization of scalable quantum computing in contrast to the fragility of the entanglement @xcite .    because of the fundamental and practical values",
    ", it is necessary to investigate the dynamic properties of quantum discord in some concrete systems of interacting spins . in semiconductor quantum dots and single molecular magnets , the magnetic properties of these systems",
    "were usually studied by the heisenberg spin models with the asymmetric anisotropic couplings such as dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions @xcite . in this paper ,",

    "compared with the case of noninteracting spin systems , the effects of spin interactions on the decoherence of quantum discord are taken into account . in section iii , the thermal property of the quantum discord is also investigated .",

    "to clearly describe the dynamics of quantum correlation , we use two types of measures including the entanglement of formation and quantum discord . for an arbitrary bipartite state @xmath0 , the total correlations are expressed by quantum mutual information @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the von neumann entropy .",

    "in fact , the temperatures of the thermal reservoirs can be varied from zero values to small ones after the local operations . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the initial state is approximately the ground state @xmath38 .",
    "the mean number @xmath39 could be a nonzero value where @xmath40 .",
    "we adopt the numerical approach to calculate the density matrix at any time . for numerical purposes , it is convenient to regard the components of density matrix @xmath41 as being written as a single column vector @xmath42 in matlab",

    "meanwhile , the entanglement of formation can be used to evaluate the quantum correlation , according to @xcite , the value of the entanglement is obtained by @xmath67 through the numerical approach , the decoherence of quantum correlation can be given by fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) .",
    "if qubits @xmath8 and @xmath7 are in the ground state , the maximally entangled ground state has the maximal value of quantum correlation , @xmath68 at the time @xmath31 . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , it is clearly shown that the values of quantum discord @xmath69 are decreased and infinitely close to zero with time .",
    "the nonvanishing phenomenon of quantum discord is different from the sudden disappearance of the entanglement . in the vicinity of @xmath70",
    ", the nonzero values of the discord can also quantify the nonclassical correlation for separable mixed states which make possible some tasks of quantum computers .",
    "however , it is noted that the decay of quantum discord is very similar to that of the entanglement before the time of the vanishing of entanglement .",
    "this aspect demonstrates that quantum discord can describe the nonlocal coherence like the entanglement .",
    "it is also valuable to investigate the case where qubits are initially in a separable state @xmath71 . from fig .",
    "1(b ) , we find that quantum discord and entanglement can be generated and then vanish in time .",
    "the behaviour arises from the coupling between qubit @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",

    "two cases of the decoherence of quantum discord are shown when the interactions between two qubits are @xmath72 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "it is found that the values of quantum discord rapidly decline to very small ones under the impact of the interaction @xmath90 .",
    "this manifests that the dramatic loss of nonclassical correlation happens when there is the strong interaction between qubits in the system .",
    "in general , states of qubits for quantum information processing are usually influenced by thermal temperatures . under the effect of the temperatures ,",
    "the thermal decoherence is unavoidable .",
    "therefore , it is of value to study the properties of quantum discord for the thermal equilibrium state . in the spin model ,",
    "the mixed state @xmath91 at any equilibrium temperature @xmath92 is expressed by @xmath93 where the partition function @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 are the @xmath97 eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath98 and corresponding eigenvalue respectively .",
    "the exact diagonal expression of @xmath98 is given by a set of eigenstates and corresponding eigenvalues , @xmath99 here the parameter @xmath100 . because the thermal state has the same form in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , the calculation of quantum discord is also solved by eq .",
    "the thermal properties of quantum discord are shown in fig .",
    "it is found that the asymmetric anisotropy @xmath87 can increase the values of quantum discord at any temperature @xmath92 .",
    "this is the reason that the asymmetric anisotropy along the @xmath101 direction induces the quantum fluctuation in the @xmath102 plane which can enhance the quantum correlation .",
    "the decay of quantum discord occurs when the temperatures @xmath92 are increased . for finite temperatures , the values of quantum discord",
    "are always nonzero .",
    "the result coincides with that of @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the thermal entanglement is gradually decreased to zero with the increase of the temperatures @xcite . in the context , it is the fact that the robustness of quantum discord against the decoherence is helpful for the realization of quantum computing .",
    "using quantum discord , we mainly investigate the decoherence of quantum correlation for two interacting qubits coupled to independent reservoirs .",
    "compared with the case of noninteracting qubits , quantum correlation of the states in the interacting qubits system decays very rapidly .",
    "the values of quantum discord decrease asymptotically in time .",
    "this nonvanishing phenomenon is apparently different from the sudden change of the entanglement .",
    "it is found that the evolution behaviour of quantum discord is very similar to that of the entanglement before the sudden disappearance of the entanglement .",
    "this demonstrates that quantum discord for inseparable states can describe the nonlocal coherence like the entanglement .",
    "moreover , after the sudden death of the entanglement , the nonzero values of quantum discord also manifest the existence of quantum correlation for separable mixed states .",
    "the thermal decoherence from the temperature is also considered .",
    "it is shown that the nonvanishing quantum discord at any finite temperature can be increased by the asymmetric anisotropy .",
    "quantum discord also declines asymptotically with the temperature .",
    "therefore , quantum discord is a general quantifier for nonclassical correlation .",
