    "the merger hypothesis @xcite suggests that the product of the merger of two spiral galaxies will be an elliptical galaxy .",
    "if this holds , then the probability to find an elliptical galaxy grows in environments with high densities and low velocity dispersions , e.g. groups of galaxies .",
    "therefore , local environment is thought to play a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is relatively easy to study cluster and group galaxies . because of this and the potential formation mechanism of elliptical galaxies , it is not surprising that most studied ellipticals are found in clusters and groups .",
    "therefore , the detailed properties of isolated field elliptical ( ife ) galaxies have not been extensively studied or very well understood ; there are only a few observational studies and the surveys are small .",
    "moreover , the formation mechanisms and evolutionary paths of these `` lonely '' elliptical galaxies are not yet well understood .    in the past two decades several observational projects",

    "* ) , ranging from clumpy collapse at an early epoch to multiple merging events .",
    "also equal - mass mergers of two massive galaxies or collapsed groups have been suggested .",
    "theoretical studies predict that isolated ellipticals are formed in relatively recent mergers of spiral galaxy pairs , while large isolated ellipticals may be the result of merging of a small group of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite concluded that at least @xmath13 per cent of their isolated elliptical galaxies show some kind of mophological distortion , and suggested that these galaxies suffered late dry mergers .",
    "@xcite compiled a sample of @xmath14 candidates of isolated early - type galaxies and studied their properties , and concluded that a major merger of two massive galaxies could explain most observed features .",
    "they also concluded that a collapsed poor group of a few galaxies is a possible formation scenario .",
    "however , @xcite studied a similar sample of isolated early - type galaxies , and concluded that isolated systems are underluminous by at least a magnitude compared with objects identified as merged group remnants .",
    "@xcite concluded that mergers at different redshifts of progenitors of different mass ratios and gas fractions are needed to reproduce the observed properties of ifes .",
    "however , some ifes have not shown any evidence of recent merging activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , who studied a sample of nine isolated elliptical galaxies , identified five galaxies that were located in environments similar to those of loose groups , while the environments of the remaining four galaxies were confirmed to be on low density .",
    "all galaxies showed smooth , azimuthally symmetric profiles , with no obvious indications of dust lanes , nascent spiral structure or star - forming regions .",
    "it is possible that the merging events have happened in distant past , and all signs of merging events have been wiped out .",
    "@xcite found out , by using a combination of numerical simulation and synthesized hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images , that merger remnants appear morphologically indistinguishable from a `` typical '' elliptical @xmath15 gyrs after the galaxies merged , while @xcite estimated from numerical simulations that the time might be even less than @xmath16 gyrs .",
    "indeed , these times are very short in time scales of galaxy evolution , making it difficult to find observational evidence to back up formation via merging events . on the other hand ,",
    "it is equally possible that some or even all of these galaxies have initially formed in underdense regions and developed quietly without any major mergers .",
    "observational studies of isolated field elliptical galaxies use similar isolation criteria as optical studies of fossil groups .",
    "both classes show a large magnitude gap between the first- and the second - ranked galaxy",
    ". however , there is no criterion for ifes that would require a presence of extended x - ray emission , as in case of fossil groups .",
    "additionally , fossil groups are not necessarily found in low - density environments @xcite like ifes . despite the differences , it is possible that the formation mechanisms of the two systems are similar or related to each other .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to compare isolated field elliptical galaxies and fossil groups , and see if these systems share a common origin .    in this paper",
    ", we use the millennium simulation @xcite together with a semi - analytical model @xcite of galaxy formation within dark matter haloes to identify isolated field elliptical galaxies , to study their properties and formation history , and to compare them with observational data .",

    "we concentrate on evolution of ifes and possible formation mechanisms , while in section [ s : discussion ] we discuss our results , the formation of field elliptical galaxies and their possible connection to fossil groups .",

    ", we adopt a parametrized hubble constant : @xmath17 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "we use a simulation that covers a big enough spatial volume and has a sufficient mass resolution  the dark matter",
    "only millennium simulation ( ms ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a @xmath18-particle model of a co - moving cube of size @xmath19 mpc , on top of which a publicly available semi - analytical galaxy model @xcite has been constructed .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in the ms were : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 where the hubble constant is characterized as @xmath26 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( for detailed description of the ms , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these values were inferred from the first - year wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) observations @xcite .",
    "the galaxy and dark matter halo formation modeling of the ms data is based on merger trees , built from @xmath27 individual snapshots . from these time - slices ,",
    "merger trees are built by combining the information of all dark matter haloes found at any given output time .",
    "this enables us to trace the formation history and growth of haloes and subhaloes through time .",
    "properties of galaxies in the ms data are obtained by using semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( sams ) , where star formation and its regulation by feedback processes is parametrized in terms of analytical physical models .",
    "the semi - analytical galaxy catalogue we use contains about nine million galaxies at @xmath28 down to a limiting absolute magnitude of @xmath29 .",
    "a detailed description of the creation of the ms galaxy catalogue , used in this study , can be found in @xcite .",
    "semi - analytical galaxy formation models are known to be less than perfect .",
    "there are several free parameters in each sam that all have a different impact on the properties of galaxies .",
    "the free parameters usually control the feedback effects and cooling of hot gas .",
    "the sam also controls how gas is stripped from a galaxy when it approaches another galaxy , and possible starburst events .",
    "the physics of these processes described is not well known .",
    "however , in general , sams can reproduce the observed galaxy luminosity function and other statistics well . as our study is statistical by nature",
    ", it is likely that the sam used for the millennium simulation galaxy catalogue is accurate enough to predict the properties of ifes and their evolution and formation history .",
    "the ms galaxy catalogue does not predict galaxy morphologies . to assign a morphology for every galaxy , we use their bulge - to - disk ratios .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between the @xmath1band bulge - to - disc ratio and the hubble type @xmath30 of galaxies from observations .",
    "the mean relation may be written : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the difference between the bulge magnitude and the total magnitude and @xmath33 .",
    "we classify galaxies with @xmath34 as ellipticals , those with @xmath35 as s0s , and those with @xmath36 as spirals and irregulars .",
    "galaxies without any bulge are classified as type @xmath37 .",
    "there are a few different selection criteria that are being used to define isolated field elliptical galaxies in observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the differences in selection criteria , all studies identifying ifes share a common ideology . in general , ifes are defined as elliptical galaxies that do not have nearby optically bright companion galaxies , usually in the @xmath1band .",
    "this is tested by using an isolation sphere or a cone and choosing a minimum magnitude difference between the brightest and the second brightest galaxy @xmath38 inside the sphere or the cone . in observational studies , the isolation cone",
    "is often taken as a circle in the sky that expands in redshift space . due to peculiar velocities ,",
    "accurate line - of - sight distances of galaxies are unknown complicating the identification .",
    "thus , observational studies differ in the numerical values of the isolation criteria . despite these differences , discussed next",
    ", we use all possible available observational data for comparison as the number of observed targets is small . for completeness , we show in section [ s : abundance ] how the number of ifes depends on the selection criteria .",
    "@xcite adopted rather strict rules for isolation , as they required that ifes can not have catalogued galaxies with known redshifts within a projected radius of @xmath39mpc and a velocity of @xmath40 km s@xmath4 , while for the morphology of the ifes they required hubble types @xmath41 . however , as their source of galaxies was the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their sample ifes might have faint companion galaxies due to the incompleteness of the source catalogue .",
    "missing companions do not affect the study of bright isolated galaxies per se , but their environment is affected by the incompleteness and missing companions .",
    "@xcite based their initial sample of ifes on the same catalogue .",
    "they adopted an even stricter criterion in projected radius , a minimum projected physical distance of @xmath42 mpc to any nearest neighbour brighter than @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite used less strict criteria in their study and required only that an ife candidate has no neighbours with brightness difference @xmath44 mag , in the @xmath1band , within @xmath45 mpc in the plane of sky and @xmath46 km s@xmath4 in recession velocity .",
    "further , their elliptical galaxies are also of hubble type @xmath41 .    for the selection of ifes from the millennium simulation",
    "we adopt the criteria used by @xcite , similar to those adopted by @xcite.we concentrate on galaxies that are incontrovertibly ellipticals and thus adopt a strict morphology limit @xmath47 .",
    "we further limit the brightness of the ife candidates with the magnitude cut - off of @xmath48 . for the isolation criterion",
    "we adopt two isolation spheres with the radii of @xmath49 and @xmath39mpc . within these isolation spheres , we require that the @xmath1band magnitude difference of the first- and second - ranked galaxies @xmath38 must be @xmath50 and @xmath51 mag , respectively . the application of the criteria is illustrated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.@xmath52 ) .",
    "our adopted values of magnitude differences correspond to factors of about eight and two in luminosity for the small and large sphere , respectively .",
    "this choice ensures that possible companions are small and light enough not to produce any major perturbations in the gravitational potential of the system .",
    "note , that in case of simulations our isolation criteria operate in real space rather than in redshift space .",
    "therefore , we can use isolation spheres rather than cones and we are not plagued by interlopers due to inaccuracies in distance measurements .      to identify isolated field elliptical candidates in the ms",
    ", we chose five independent cubic volumes inside the simulation box .",
    "initially , we chose each volume to have a side length of @xmath53 mpc , while none of the cubes overlap .",
    "however , we later limited the volume from where the possible ife candidates can be identified to have a side length of @xmath54 mpc .",
    "this was done to enable the study of the surroundings of each ife candidate in the same fashion . moreover , without the limitation , we could have accidentally identified a field elliptical candidate @xmath55mpc from an edge of the box , leading to a possible false identification .",
    "the five volumes were chosen to overcome computational issues and for easier study of ife environment .",
    "with five independent volumes it is also possible to make comparisons between the ifes of each volume .    at first all galaxies inside each volume",
    "are treated as possible ife candidates . after identifying all candidates with @xmath47 and @xmath56",
    "we apply the isolation criteria discussed in the previous section .",
    "this produces an initial list of @xmath57 galaxies that fulfill the criteria for isolated field elliptical galaxies . after compiling the initial list of ifes , we inspected every galaxy individually , and found that nine candidates were not the main galaxy of the dark matter halo they reside in . therefore , all galaxies that fulfill the observationally motivated ife criteria are not the central galaxies of their friends - of - friends dark matter groups . in a strict sense",
    "these are not isolated galaxies , as they belong to a dark matter halo containing galaxies more massive and more luminous than the ife candidate .",
    "therefore , we omit them from the final list of ifes , which contains @xmath58 galaxies .",
    "we also compile two control samples of elliptical galaxies for comparisons .",
    "the first control sample contains in total @xmath59 elliptical ( @xmath47 ) galaxies brighter than @xmath0 in the @xmath1band at the redshift @xmath28 and it is named as ellipticals ( abridged as es ) . for the second control sample ,",
    "called main ellipticals ( abridged as mes ) , we only select galaxies of the first control sample that are the main galaxies of their dark matter haloes .",
    "this requirement further limits the ellipticals sample , and we are left with @xmath60 galaxies in the main ellipticals sample .",
    "the removed galaxies are interesting from another point of view than regular ifes , as these nine non - standard ifes are subhalo galaxies ( i.e. satellites of a larger galaxy ) and have multiple nearby companions , from @xmath61 to @xmath62 inside the large isolation sphere .",
    "thus , these galaxies are not isolated in galaxy number density , but reside in a cluster rather than in the field .",
    "physically it is obvious that a satellite galaxy is not the dominant galaxy in its dark matter halo . since we find these non - standard ifes , our observationally motivated isolation criteria are not strict enough and the radii of the isolation spheres should be slightly larger to avoid any false identifications . but",
    "as the number of non - standard ifes is small , we can keep the criteria and remove the non - standard galaxies from our final sample , as described above .",
    "the satellite non - standard `` isolated '' elliptical galaxies can shed some light on the observational result @xcite where an ife galaxy ( ngc 1600 ) was also found to be located off from the dynamical centre of the system .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray emission is centered slightly to the northeast of ngc 1600 , suggesting that the galaxy is not at the centre of the gravitational potential .",
    "the dynamical study and the x - ray observations together suggest that ngc 1600 is surrounded by a massive halo extending out to several hundred kiloparsecs .",
    "a subhalo galaxy , fulfilling the optical ife criteria , could explain the observations of ngc 1600 .",
    "all nine galaxies in our simulations reside inside a large dark matter halo , and in observations would be found to be off from the centre of the potential well , as in the case of ngc 1600 .",
    "however , a massive and more luminous galaxy than ngc 1600 has not been detected at the centre of the potential well in observations , while this is often the case in simulations .",
    "thus , a more straightforward explanation , where the ife orbits around the centre of the potential well and therefore seems to be shifted from the centre , seen in x - ray observations , is more plausible .",
    "this is in agreement with an x - ray study of another isolated elliptical ngc 4555 , which is assumed not to lie in the centre of a massive group - scale dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "below we compare the properties of simulated ifes with those of the observed ifes .",
    "if these are close enough , it will justify the theoretical study of the formation , evolution and merger histories of ifes , using the simulated ife population . due to the large number of simulated ifes we can actually make theoretical predictions for properties , formation mechanisms and evolution of ifes that can be tested against observational data when the sample of observations is large enough .    in following sections",
    "we use the kolmogorov@xmath63smirnov ( ks ) two - sample test to study the maximum deviation between the cumulative distributions of two samples .",
    "the null hypothesis of the ks test is that the two samples are from the same population .",
    "we give our results as probabilities ( p - values ) that the difference between the two samples could have arisen by change if they are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "the fraction of isolated field elliptical ( @xmath47 and @xmath56 mag ) galaxies among all galaxies of any brightness , morphology or dark matter halo status in the ms is merely @xmath64 per cent , corresponding to a number density of @xmath65h@xmath66 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "this is a very low number density , however , such a straightforward calculation is not totally justified .",
    "more meaningful number to conside is the fraction of ifes among elliptical galaxies .",
    "moreover , our morphology limit ( @xmath47 ) for a simulated ife is very strict , biasing the fraction of elliptical galaxies to significantly lower fractions than observed in the real universe .",
    "thus , we also identified isolated field elliptical galaxies with relaxed morphology limit @xmath34 and quote the fractions below .",
    "about @xmath67 per cent of all simulated elliptical ( now @xmath34 ) galaxies of any brightness , can be identified as ifes , when the criteria of section [ selection ] are adopted for ifes .",
    "if we relax the strict morphology limit of the ifes and require that ifes also have @xmath34 the fraction rises to @xmath68 per cent as about @xmath42 times more ifes can be identified . relaxing the morphology limit will therefore change the number density of ifes to @xmath69h@xmath66 mpc@xmath3 . when the brightness of the simulated elliptical galaxies and their morphologies are limited to @xmath56 at @xmath70 and @xmath47 , respectively , about @xmath71 per cent of these galaxies are identified as ifes at redshift zero . if we further limit our simulated elliptical galaxies to galaxies that are the main galaxies of their dark matter haloes ( as in case of ifes ) , @xmath72 per cent of ellipticals are now identified as ifes .",
    "thus , ifes are very rare objects among all galaxies , but at the same time , over @xmath61 per cent of main elliptical galaxies brighter than @xmath0 mag in @xmath1band can be classified as ifes .",
    "@xcite found from magnitude limited ( @xmath73 ) observations that less than three per cent of all galaxies can be classified as isolated .",
    "this value should be interpreted as an upper limit for the number of ifes , as it was based on all types of galaxies .",
    "@xcite further found that early - type galaxies outnumber s@xmath74 galaxies @xmath75 in very isolated areas .",
    "however , as spiral galaxies are the most dominant galaxy type in low densities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the observable estimate of the number of ifes is significantly lower than one per cent .",
    "@xcite concluded that early - type galaxies amount to only @xmath76 per cent among all isolated galaxies , lowering the observational estimate of ifes to @xmath77 per cent .",
    "this fraction is in good agreement with our findings as about @xmath78 per cent of all simulated galaxies can be identified as ifes when @xmath34 morphology limit has been adopted .",
    "as observational studies adopt different criteria for isolation , we illustrate their influence on the number of ifes , with a stricter set of parameter values . for simplicity , we adopt only one isolation sphere with a radius of @xmath79 mpc , and require that the magnitude difference between the brightest and the second brightest galaxy @xmath38 is @xmath80 mag inside the isolation sphere . for the hubble type , we adopt the same requirement as previously for our ifes : @xmath47 .",
    "such values were used , e.g. , by @xcite . with these values",
    "we find that only @xmath81 per cent of all ms galaxies can be classified as ifes , corresponding to an extremely low number density of @xmath82h@xmath66 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "this is approximately ten times less than before .",
    "it is obvious that changing the isolation criteria has a major impact on the number of ifes and therefore their statistical properties , as stricter parameter values require a galaxy that is located in a true void .",
    "this result also shows that galaxies with comparable luminosities tend to reside in relatively close proximity rather than being truly isolated from any other reasonable sized companion .    the results of this section show that the fraction of isolated field elliptical galaxies depends highly on the isolation criteria adopted , but also on the morphological type that is required .",
    "as the morphological type of simulated galaxies is less than precise our number density for ifes should not be taken as a strict limit , but as a guideline when observations are being planned .",
    "thus , higher fractions of ifes can be expected if isolation criteria or morphology limits are being relaxed .",
    "the easiest property of ifes to observe must be the luminosity , and thus the colour - magnitude relation .",

    "the larger fraction of ifes having major mergers than mes can also be due to the requirement of the magnitude gap not only the region they formed in .",

    "ifes that belong to the coupling class form later than cannibal ifes and are found to reside in lighter dark matter haloes than cannibal ifes : the median masses are @xmath153 and @xmath154m@xmath91 , respectively .",

    "study of stellar populations could provide a way to identify ifes that have experienced an equal sized merging , but this may not be applicable for high redshifts .    a cannibal ife can be a merger remnant of a small or compact group .",
    "we find cannibal ifes to reside in more massive and larger dark matter haloes than other types of ifes .",
    "however , their dark matter haloes are less massive than haloes of typical groups , leaving only small or compact groups to consider .",

    "our study shows that the primary driver for the large magnitude gap of ifes is either a merging of a comparable sized galaxy pair or effective mass accretion and sweeping up of surrounding galaxies ( coupling and cannibalism , respectively ) .",
    "@xcite argue that fossil groups can be identified from dark matter only simulations if one selects dark matter haloes more massive than @xmath167m@xmath91 .",
    "they argue that above that limit , all optical fossil groups in the millennium simulation have enough hot gas to show x - ray emission , therefore qualifying as x - ray fossils .",

    "moreover , they suggest that x - ray fossil groups are not a distinct class of objects but rather that they are extreme examples of groups which collapse early and experience little recent growth .",
    "this formation scenario does not apply for ifes , as cannibal ifes can have merging activity till the redshift @xmath172 , and ifes start to form later than fossil groups .",
    "although a large magnitude gap seen in both fossils and ifes could imply a similar formation mechanism , the above comparison does not support this idea . considering the assembly and formation times",
    "it seems unlikely that fossil groups , and especially their brightest galaxies , could share the same formation mechanism as isolated field elliptical galaxies . the large differences in dark matter halo masses of fossil groups and the most massive ifes makes it improbable that fossil groups and ifes are the same class of objects seen at different phases of their evolution .",
    "we therefore conclude that fossil groups and ifes form two distinct classes .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold : 1 ) to compare simulated field elliptical galaxies with observed ones and to make predictions on their properties , and 2 ) to define the formation mechanism and history of isolated field elliptical galaxies .",
    "we also discuss if isolated field elliptical galaxies are related to fossil groups and if they can share a common formation mechanism .",
    "our results show that it is possible to identify isolated field elliptical galaxies ( ifes ) from cosmological @xmath173body simulations with semi - analytical models of galaxy formation , that have similar properties to observed ifes .",
    "we show that simulated ifes are in good agreement with observations when similar identification criteria are adopted .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagram of simulated ifes agree with observations , and the average colour of simulated and observed ifes are within their error limits when all simulated ifes are considered .",
    "unfortunately , observational data sets are still small complicating more detailed comparison .",
    "an agreement in age and mass estimates of ifes between observations and simulations is found . however , the age comparisons are less robust due to different age definitions .",
    "our results show that isolated field ellipticals are very rare objects ; we find their total number density to be as low as @xmath65h@xmath66 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "our result agrees with observational estimates of number of ifes , which however , are inaccurate at best .",
    "our ifes have a small number of companion galaxies , ranging from only a few dwarf companions to as much as about @xmath95 .",
    "thus , ifes are not completely isolated , although they are found to be located in underdense regions .",
    "our results show that ifes reside in relatively light dark matter haloes . however , at the same time , the baryonic to dark matter ratio is higher in ifes than in es generally .",
    "the stellar mass of ifes grows almost linearly with the dark matter mass with a mass ratio ( dark / stellar ) of @xmath174 , whereas our comparison ellipticals have a lower stellar to dark matter ratio .",
    "therefore , ifes are good candidates for galaxies with low dark matter mass to stellar light ratio .",
    "we also find a flat @xmath1band luminosity function for our simulated ifes .    when studying the basic properties of ifes we find that ifes populate different regions in colour - magnitude diagrams than regular elliptical galaxies , which are found mostly in the red sequence .",
    "this is due to the bimodality of the distribution of colours , as ifes populate not only the red sequence , but also the blue cloud . from simulation data we find a separate population of blue and faint ifes . on average ifes",
    "are found to be bluer than our control sample ellipticals , howevever , this result is biased because of the separate population of ifes .",
    "the bluest ifes are found to reside in light dark matter haloes , while red ifes are usually found inside more massive ( @xmath175 ) dark matter haloes .",
    "we note that simulations predict a previously unobserved population of blue , dim and light galaxies that fulfill observational criteria to be classified as isolated field elliptical galaxies .",
    "these galaxies have only a few companions , which are usually located many times further away than the virial radius of their dark matter halo .",
    "these blue , dim and light ifes have formed their stars only lately and have continued to accrete dark matter mass till redshift zero .",
    "this population of ifes is very interesting as it has not been detected yet in observations .",
    "our results also show that ifes start to form around the same epoch as the galaxies of the control sample ( mes ) ; however , ifes seem to accumulate stellar mass much faster .",
    "ifes form stars more efficiently than mes , while mes accrete dark matter slightly faster than ifes .",
    "we confirm that ifes form the bulk of their stars at @xmath107 , as suggested in @xcite . by the redshift one ifes",
    "have formed over half of their stars ( stellar mass ) and have gathered as much as @xmath62 per cent of their final dark matter .",
    "the galaxies of mes sample have accreted roughly the same fraction of dark matter as ifes by @xmath108 .",
    "however , they have formed as little as @xmath61 per cent of their stars compared to the final stellar matter at @xmath28 .",
    "this difference shows that ifes form their stars quickly and are rather dark - matter poor compared to other elliptical galaxies .",
    "moreover , ifes continue to accrete dark matter till @xmath28 while mes have gathered @xmath109 per cent of their final dark matter already by @xmath110 .",
    "we note that more massive ( and luminous ) ifes have older stellar populations , while the lighter ones have formed a signification fraction of their stellar mass relatively recently .    while studying the evolution of ifes we note that almost half ( @xmath176 per cent ) of ifes have experienced at least one major merger during their formation history , while only about four per cent ( es ) up to one third ( mes ) of control sample ellipticals experience a major merger .",
    "major merging events happen later in ifes evolution than for control sample galaxies , the average of the latest major merging being @xmath8 for ifes while it is @xmath10 for mes .",
    "we also find ifes that have not experienced a single merger event above the mass resolution limit of the ms during their evolution .",
    "therefore , it is possible to form elliptical galaxies without major mergers .    when inspecting the merger trees of simulated ifes , we identify three typical formation scenarios : solitude , coupling , and cannibalism , which can all lead to a formation of an ife .",
    "the scenarios range from a solitary growth ( solitude class ) with quiet mass accretion and star formation to more violent evolution with multiple mergers ( cannibalism class ) .",
    "we also identify a formation scenario where two comparable sized galaxies merge to form an ife ( coupling class ) .",
    "our merger trees show that merging events are important for ifes that form through cannibalism or coupling .",

    "<S> we study the properties , evolution and formation mechanisms of isolated field elliptical galaxies . we create a mock catalogue of isolated field elliptical galaxies from the millennium simulation galaxy catalogue , and trace their merging histories . the formation , identity and assembly redshifts of simulated isolated and non - isolated elliptical galaxies are studied and compared . </S>",
    "<S> observational and numerical data are used to compare age , mass , and the colour - magnitude relation . </S>",
    "<S> our results , based on simulation data , show that almost seven per cent of all elliptical galaxies brighter than @xmath0 mag in @xmath1band can be classified as isolated field elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> results also show that isolated elliptical galaxies have a rather flat luminosity function ; a number density of @xmath2 mpc@xmath3 mag@xmath4 , throughout their @xmath1band magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> isolated field elliptical galaxies show bluer colours than non - isolated elliptical galaxies and they appear younger , in a statistical sense , according to their mass weighted age . </S>",
    "<S> isolated field elliptical galaxies also form and assemble at lower redshifts compared to non - isolated elliptical galaxies . about @xmath5 per cent of isolated field </S>",
    "<S> elliptical galaxies have undergone at least one major merging event in their formation history , while the same fraction is only @xmath6 per cent for non - isolated ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> almost all ( @xmath7 per cent ) isolated elliptical galaxies show merging activity during their evolution , pointing towards the importance of mergers in the formation of isolated field elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the mean time of the last major merging is at @xmath8 or @xmath9 gyrs ago for isolated ellipticals , while non - isolated ellipticals experience their last major merging significantly earlier at @xmath10 or @xmath11 gyrs ago . after inspecting merger trees of simulated isolated field elliptical galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that three different , yet typical formation mechanisms can be identified : solitude , coupling and cannibalism . </S>",
    "<S> our results also predict a previously unobserved population of blue , dim and light galaxies that fulfill observational criteria to be classified as isolated field elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this separate population comprises @xmath12 per cent of all ifes .    </S>",
