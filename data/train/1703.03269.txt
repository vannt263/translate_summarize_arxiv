    "@xcite , where orbital @xmath140 and @xmath98 correspond to orbitals @xmath72 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "we introduce the orbital spinor ( omitting site and spin indices for simplicity ) @xmath141 the wannier orbitals transform among each other like the atomic @xmath68 orbitals , which have wave functions @xmath142 and @xmath143 , with some radial part @xmath144 . by forming linear combinations of @xmath72 and @xmath71 ,",
    "one arrives at the other basis states @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "these linear combinations can be conveniently represented as rotations in orbital - pseudospin space , generated by ( @xmath149 denote the pauli matrices ) @xmath150 rotations by @xmath151 give , @xmath152 where the last equality can be checked by evaluating the operators on the one - particle states , e.g. , @xmath153 @xmath154 @xmath155 $ ] @xmath156 . in summary , successive application of @xmath157 corresponds to a permutation of the orbitals @xmath158 @xcite .    with the orbital spinor ,",

    "it is instructive to verify the symmetries for the dmft equations , , , : one can show that in equilibrium ( i.e. , for @xmath194 ) the solution is rotationally invariant around the @xmath195 axis in orbital pseudospin , i.e. , if @xmath178 is a solution , @xmath196 is a solution as well for all @xmath197 . to show this we rotate the spinors , @xmath198 , so that @xmath199/z$ ] .",

    "<S> clearly , a highly appealing scenario beyond photo - excitation is to achieve full control of the quantum many - body dynamics even during the excitation pulse , which could enable a reversible manipulation of optically induced phase transitions .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , the problem of such ultrafast and reversible control of solids has been attacked by engineering light - dressed hamiltonians with off - resonant time - periodic perturbations . </S>",

    "<S> while in equilibrium the ratio @xmath107 and @xmath108 is only a function of @xmath109 , in nonequilibrium , one can both access parameter regimes which correspond to a different ratio @xmath109 , and those regimes which are inaccessible in equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> below we verify eq .   by discussing light - induced orbital dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on a simple situation where the spin direction is entirely polarized , such that only the triplet term in eq .   contributes , which is the antiferro - orbital @xmath97 kompass model . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to first look at the classical mean - field dynamics of the orbital model . assuming anti - ferro - orbital order with @xmath110 for site @xmath30 on either of the two sublattices ( labelled @xmath111 ) , we obtain mean - field equations of motion @xmath112 , with an orbital pseudo - magnetic field that has contributions from each of the two neighbors along the @xmath104 bonds , @xmath113 ; the geometry of the exchange along the different bonds is captured by the tensor @xmath114 one can see that in equilibrium , with @xmath115 , any configuration in the orbital ( @xmath116 ) plane corresponds to an equilibrium solution , with @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> an external field , polarized along one axis , _ independently _ modifies the exchange along the three bond directions , and thus induces a precessional dynamics @xcite .    to confirm the prediction from the strong - coupling analysis </S>",

    "<S> this technique , which maps the lattice model onto a set of coupled single - impurity models , has been described elsewhere , and we defer the details of the implementation to the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> the model is solved on the cubic lattice with a simplified closed form self - consistency , using a hybridization expansion impurity solver @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the insulating regime at @xmath118 and bandwidth @xmath119 at initial ( inverse ) temperature @xmath120 , which corresponds to antiferro - orbital order along the @xmath83-direction , with @xmath121 .     in a cubic environment ( @xmath118 , @xmath55 , @xmath120 ) . </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig:03]a shows the time - evolution of the ordered orbital moment on one sublattice during and after a gaussian field pulse , with polarization along the @xmath90-direction . for smaller fields ( @xmath127 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the transverse @xmath128 and @xmath129 components of the orbital order follows the mean - field solution of the spin model , obtained with the time - dependent @xmath130 from eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( dashed lines ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the orbital pseudo - magnetic field @xmath131 always lies in the @xmath132 plane , but due to the bond - dependent exchange coupling ( inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:03]b ) it is rotated from the original @xmath133 direction , such that the precessional motion generates a component @xmath122 , which corresponds to a complex superposition of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 orbital . for larger fields </S>",
    "<S> , the dmft results decrease during the pulse compared to the spin model . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood as the strong fields induce charge excitations , which have been projected out in the unitary perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:03]c , where we show that the double occupancy @xmath134 is increased after the pulse ( the increase during the pulse corresponds to virtual fluctuations ) . for a high density of excitations , </S>",
    "<S> the orbital ordered moment @xmath126 starts to decrease after the pulse ( see inset ) , in analogy to the melting of antiferromagnetic spin order by photo - doping @xcite .     with given duration @xmath135 </S>",

    "<S> finally , we use the same dmft setup to find the parameters that realize a desired effect on the ordered state at the least amount of electronic excitation . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig:04 ] shows a color map of the absorption , measured in terms of the increase @xmath136 of the double occupancy , for pulses within a range of frequencies and field amplitudes , keeping the duration @xmath135 of the pulse fixed . the vertical axis is the accumulated precession of the component @xmath122 , which first increases with the field , but can not exceed a certain maximum as excitations set in at larger amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that close to the resonance @xmath138 , and to some extent @xmath139 , almost no precession can be obtained , as absorption processes strongly compete with the off - resonant dynamics described by the effective exchange hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that to induce a certain effect in the most reversible way , it is best to go to the quasi - dc regime , corresponding to thz excitation in the mott insulator . alternatively </S>",
    "<S> , one can go to the high - frequency regime , but in real solids there are typically charge excitations to other electronic bands that are not captured in the present simulations .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the manipulation of spin and orbital exchange hamiltonians with electric fields of arbitrary time - profile . </S>",
    "<S> a time - dependent schrieffer - wolff transformation provides an important guiding principle for the evaluation of the effective exchange interactions , as we quantitatively verified by solving the full electronic model which includes the absorption due to field - induced tunnelling or ( multi)photon absorption . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in order to control exchange interactions in the most reversible way , our analysis strongly favors low frequency , quasi dc , electric fields corresponding to thz excitation of the mott insulator .    </S>",
    "<S> these findings suggest many possibilities for future studies . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , orbital ordering is often coupled to jahn - teller distortions of the lattice . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the field induced exchange interactions provide one part of the force on the ordering , and it will be interesting to study the combined effect . moreover , the actual order in the orbital models is not rotationally invariant like in spacial mean field simulations , but entropically stabilized in certain directions due to non - local fluctuations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting and open problem is therefore to study the dynamics of a ( classical or quantum ) model with time - dependent @xmath65 , taking into account these entropic forces . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our results suggests that it is very interesting to investigate the thz manipulation of exchange hamiltonians for reversible control of magnetic order at ultralow energy load .    </S>",
