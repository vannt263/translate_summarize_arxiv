    "the wide - field spectroscopic surveys revealed high frequency of carbon - enhanced stars with [ c / fe ] @xmath7 1.0 ( hereafter cemp stars ) among metal - poor stars @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "up to 30 percents of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 2.5 are carbon - rich .",
    "the chemical abundances of cemp stars reflect the origin of cno and neutron capture elements in the early galaxy .",
    "cemp stars have a wide variety of elemental abundance patterns * ( see @xcite ; and references therein)*. the majority of cemp stars have enhanced s - process elements @xcite and are referred to as cemp - s stars .",
    "other cemp stars exhibit strong enhancements of r - process elements ( cemp - r ) or the presence of enhanced neutron - capture elements associated with both the r- and s@xmath2processes ( cemp - r / s ) .",
    "the class of cemp - no stars comprises stars that , in spite of high carbon ( and often n and o ) overabundances with respect to fe , do not exhibit strong neutron - capture elements . recently , cemp stars have also been found with large enhancements of @xmath8-elements @xcite , which @xcite refer to as cemp-@xmath8 stars .",
    "observed cemp stars bear signatures of thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) and explosive nucleosynthesis in the early galaxy and subsequent mixing or mass transfer in single or binary stars ( see @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "the carbon in the cemp - s stars is very likely to have been produced by an intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) companion that has transferred material to the currently observed star .",
    "@xcite suggest that all cemp - s stars observed until now are old halo main sequence and turn - off stars or giants of a low initial mass ( m @xmath9 ) .",
    "the origin of the carbon in the other cemp classes is not yet fully understood .",
    "the cemp - no stars are of special interest because the observed cno elements probably have been produced by a primordial population of massive ( 20 @xmath10 100 ) and megametal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath6 6 ) stars , which are predicted to have experienced significant mass loss of cno - enhanced material via strong winds @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the carbon excess at extremely low metallicity may have been produced by the ejecta of the so - called faint supernovae @xcite .",
    "a high @xmath11 ratio is observed rarely among the analyzed cemp stars .",
    "the cemp - no stars exhibit quite low @xmath11 ratios ( in the range 4 @xmath6 @xmath11 @xmath6 10 ) , indicating that a significant amount of mixing has occurred in their progenitor objects @xcite .",
    "strong mixing occurs on the red giant branch due to the first dredge - up ( fdu ) affecting carbon and nitrogen abundances and decreasing the @xmath11 ratio .",
    "however , it is not sufficient to explain the low isotopic ratios @xmath12 30 observed for most of the studied cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars ( see @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "further extra - mixing has to be hypothesized during the following agb phase to interpret the observations .",
    "cool bottom processing ( cbp ) may explain the observed [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] . according to @xcite , most of the studied cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars need the occurrence of cbp to describe the observed abundance patterns .",
    "the observed [ c / fe ] ratios agree with agb predictions without involving of extra - mixing only in four stars : cs22880@xmath2074 , cs30315@xmath291 , he0507@xmath21653 , and he1429@xmath20551 .",
    "the first two stars show , in addition , relatively high lower limits for @xmath11 ( @xmath74060 ) .",

    "the bolometric magnitude estimated by @xcite , @xmath15 = 3.35 mag , is in a good agreement with an independent estimation provided by @xcite , @xmath15 = 3.5 mag .",
    "estimation of the trigonometric distance is not possible because of a negative parallax value for hd112869 , @xmath16 1.28 mas @xcite .",
    "effective temperature for hd112869 was determined by means of the infrared flux method ( irfm ) , which uses the ratio of bolometric flux to the infrared flux in l band , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature found by @xcite using the same method is a bit higher , @xmath18 = 3870 k. @xcite calculated the effective temperature , @xmath18 = 4100 k , by fitting the near infrared spectra at wavelengths of 1.35 , 1.74 , and 2.29 @xmath19 m , where the molecular absorption because of co , cn , and @xmath20 is relatively low , with the model spectra .",
    "surface gravity , @xmath21 = 0.4 ( cgs ) , was estimated by @xcite using the well known relation between @xmath21 , @xmath18 , stellar mass ( m ) , and @xmath15 , assuming for the star 1@xmath22 .",
    "@xcite used for spectral synthesis two different values of @xmath21 , 0.0 and 2.0 ( cgs ) . the microturbulent velocity ( @xmath23 )",

    "radial - velocity monitoring of hd112869 was started in 2006 using the coravel spectrometer of the vilnius university installed on the 1.65-m telescope at the moltai observatory ( lithuania ) .",
    "the coravel spectrometer @xcite is based on principles of the photoelectric radial - velocity scanner developed by r.f.griffin @xcite and it operates by scanning the spectrum of a star across the mask and obtaining an on - line cross - correlation velocity .",
    "97 measurements are gathered for hd112869 during about 8 years of monitoring .",
    "the standard deviation of a single observation for late - type stars brighter than about 11th magnitude is usually better than 0.8  km s@xmath26 .",
    "the velocities have been standardized using the observations of iau radial velocity standards @xcite and are close to the system of velocities published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the difference in zero point was found to be 0.14  km s@xmath26 for f - g - k type stars and 0.4  km s@xmath26 for m - type stars and exhibits rms scatters of 0.5 and 0.8 kms@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "photometric @xmath27 observations were performed from 2013 february to 2014 june at the moltai observatory using the twin - telescope photometric system .",
    "it consists of the 63-cm and 25-cm telescopes for simultaneous measurements of a target star and of a comparison star , respectively , and is equipped with two identical photoelectric ( multi - alkali photocathodes of type s20 ) photometers connected to the same data acquisition system .",
    "the ratio of counting efficiency of one telescope to that of another was checked from time to time by measuring the same star .",
    "the comparison stars , hd114036 and hd114357 , are chosen to lie within 2@xmath14 from hd112869 and are bright enough to be accessible with the 25-cm telescope .",
    "the simultaneous measurements and the proximity of the comparison stars to hd112869 reduced the effects of variations of atmospheric transparency .    a set of 12 standard stars of spectral types from late f to k5 was observed repeatedly at various air masses to measure atmospheric extinction and to place the data of differential photometry on a standard magnitude scale .",
    "both the extinction coefficients and the transformation to the standard johnson - cousins system were then calculated using a least - squares routine which solves simultaneously all repeated observations . since the primary standards in the cousins system @xcite are not accessible from the moltai observatory sky , for the transformation of instrumental @xmath28 magnitude we addressed the catalog of @xmath29 magnitudes of bright stars of the northern sky by @xcite , in which all of these 12 standard stars are found .",
    "the @xmath30 magnitude of the @xmath29 catalog , however , is not in the cousins system , therefore we transformed it to @xmath31 using an additional set of 19 stars having both the cousins and @xmath29 photometry .",
    "the uncertainty of the transformation equation obtained for r is 0.018 mag .",
    "standardized @xmath27 photometry of the comparison stars is listed in table  [ comp_stars ] .",

    "we selected a frequently employed for abundance analysis baii line at 6141.713   but , we were not able to reproduce the neighboring @xmath20 and cn lines using the final atmospheric model because of the uncertain molecular data ( figure  [ fig19 ] ) . again , the calculated atomic spectra were fitted with the observed spectrum and the iterated abundance was accepted as an upper limit of barium abundance , [ ba / fe ] @xmath730.7 dex .",
    "nlte corrections for the strontium and barium lines should be lower than 0.14 dex @xcite . the baii line at 4934.076   confirms the absence of barium overabundance , [ ba / fe ] @xmath620.1 dex .",
    "thus , two synthesized barium lines confirm a mild depletion of the heavy s@xmath2process element barium , [ ba / fe ] @xmath740.3 dex , on average .",
    "spectral synthesis of two neodymium lines in the wavelength region redward of the @xmath20(0,0 ) bandhead shows the nd enhancement ( see figure  [ fig20 ] ) .",
    "synthesis of the laii line at 4086.709 and smii line at 4220.660   confirms a similar overabundance .",
    "thus , at least some of the elements of the second s@xmath2peak appear to be enhanced in the atmosphere of hd112868 .",
    "however , because of possibly weak unknown molecular blends we decided to be conservative and provide the upper abundance limits for the calculated neutron capture elements ( table  [ abundances ] ) . a spectrum of very high resolution is needed to update the calculated abundances and to examine the third s@xmath2process peak which should be most enhanced according the theory of nucleosynthesis of metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "our efforts to calculate the abundance of the r@xmath2process element europium was plagued by strong molecular blends and uncertain molecular data around the selected lines .",
    "the euii line at 6645.127   was selected to be the best candidate for abundance analysis . however , we concluded during our calculations that the feature identified to be the europium line is blueshifted by about 6 km @xmath1 relative to its rest wavelength . the main contributor to the feature at 6645.0  , measured in the spectrum of hd112869 ,",
    "was identified to be the cn line at 6644.961  , and the euii line seems to be only a weak blend on the red wing of the cn line .",
    "only a crude estimation of an upper limit of the europium abundance was possible because of uncertain oscillator strengths for the cn line at 6644.961   and for the neighboring @xmath20 lines at 6645.509 and 6645.611  .",
    "we modified the oscillator strengths of these three molecular lines to fit the observed profiles and then estimated the contribution of europium .",
    "a strong enhancement of r@xmath2process was denied for the atmosphere of hd112869 , [ eu / fe ] @xmath60 0.8 dex ( see figure  [ fig21 ] ) .",
    "a comprehensive calculation of the atmospheric abundance for hd112869 from a high - resolution photographic spectrum was provided by @xcite , which resulted in the abundances for 26 elements .",
    "unfortunatelly , his results are illustrated only in two narrow wavelength ranges around @xmath20 bandheads and the list of employed atomic lines is absent . the iron abundance calculated by @xcite is lower that found in this paper and a difference of @xmath750.6 dex seems to be mainly because of nlte effects .",
    "@xcite calculated the iron abundance using neutral lines which are supposedly suffered from nlte effects .",
    "@xcite studied the effects of metallicity for hd112869 using sed and the best fit with the observed spectral energy distribution for this star was achieved using the model with [ fe / h ] @xmath762.0 ( see fig . 4 in @xcite .",
    "the carbon to oxygen ratio calculated by @xcite is typical of n - type carbon stars , c / o = 1.07 , however , the adopted oxygen abundance is extremely high , @xmath77 ( o ) = 8.8 ( see , also , comment in @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "obtained the c / o ratio in the range from 3.4 to 20 for six different atmospheric models with the calculated c / o value of 6.3 for the model with similar atmospheric parameters ( see table 1 ) and a the more reliable oxygen abundance , [ o / fe ] = + 0.5 dex .",
    "thus , the c / o ratio calculated by us is in line with that calculated by @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic estimates of oxygen abundance for hd112869 are still absent .",
    "large discrepancy between the calculated nitrogen abundance ( @xmath322.3 dex ) and those by @xcite follows partly from the difference in the adopted carbon abundance .",
    "nobody has detected molecular isotopic lines in the spectrum of hd112869 .",
    "spectral synthesis of the selected wavelength regions near the position of isotopic @xmath20 and cn lines provides a high lower limit for the carbon isotopic ratio of @xmath11  from 50 @xcite to 5000 @xcite for six different models .",
    "thus , our calculations are in line with the high @xmath11 ratio calculated by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a large enhancement of neutron capture elements relative to the extremely low iron abundance ( [ fe / h ] = 2.9 ) in the atmosphere of hd112869 , [ n / fe ] @xmath4 + 2.5 dex , on average , for 13 elements , which is in conflict with the present results .",
    "the reason of large discrepancy is not clear , however , @xcite has noted that because of heavy blending of lines the calculated abundances could be only the upper limits .",
    "thus , the large overabundance of neutron - capture elements estimated by @xcite seems to be related to neglected molecular blending . notice that we identified only a few relatively unblended lines of neutron capture elements in the wavelength regions where molecular contamination is lower .",
    "notice , too , that an overestimation of s@xmath2process abundances calculated by @xcite was detected for the comparison star hd25408 ( see table  [ basic_dat ] ) .",
    "the radial - velocity monitoring of hd212869 shows variations with a peak to peak amplitude of about 10  km s@xmath26 and a dominating period of about 114.9 days .",
    "the variations are semiregular , with some changes from cycle to cycle and a significant scatter of velocities near the velocity extremums , which exceeds the standard error of measurements .",
    "similar velocity variations and scatter are observed for two protoplanetary - nebulae  hd235858 and bd+42@xmath144388 @xcite .",
    "the velocity variations of hd112869 are accompanied by light and color variations .",
    "however , the light and color curves are shifted in phase relative to the velocity curve .",
    "the reason for the velocity , light , and color variations is obviously the pulsations in the atmosphere of hd112869 .",
    "the character of pulsations is similar to that observed for evolved stars .",
    "the dominating period agrees well with the fundamental mode calculated for luminous ( @xmath78 3.2 ) and low mass ( m = 0.8@xmath22 ) stars in the large magellanic cloud ( see figure 25 in @xcite ) .",
    "the metallicity calculated for hd212869 is higher than that estimated prior to using high - resolution spectra .",
    "the iron abundance is found to be [ fe / h ] = @xmath610.2 dex on the basis of ionised lines which are almost free from nlte effects .",
    "the carbon abundance was found to be high in the atmosphere of hd112869 , @xmath57 = 8.3 @xmath3 0.1 dex .",
    "the nitrogen abundance is @xmath63 = 6.55 @xmath3 0.2 dex . with the obtained abundances [ c / fe ] = + 2.2 dex and [ c / n ] = + 1.15 , hd112869 occupies the region of cemp - s stars on the plots [ c / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] and [ c / n ] vs. [ fe / h ] ( see figures 5 and 6 in @xcite . however , the s ",
    "process elements sr , y , and ba are not enhanced significantly , thus confirming by definition @xcite the cemp - no status of hd112869 .",
    "however , the nd abundance seems to be enhanced relative to iron and a similar overabundance was recognized for lanthanum and samarium . from inspection of the euii line at 6645.127  , the upper limit was set for the r@xmath2process element europium , [ eu / fe ] @xmath60 + 0.8 dex . according to calculations carried out by @xcite ,",
    "the abundances of three s - peaks are strongly dependent on the choice of the @xmath13-pocket as well as on the initial mass and the metallicity .",
    "[ ls / fe ] , [ hs / fe ] and [ pb / fe ] do not follow a linear behavior with decreasing metallicity and can cover a large range of values . for the low mass models the enhancement of the first s - process peak is low or absent .",
    "a spectrum of very high - resolution is needed to estimate the abundances for large number of the second s@xmath2process peaks and to recognize an overabundance of the third s@xmath2process peak . with the adopted oxgen abundance , [ o / fe ] = + 0.8 dex ,",
    "the carbon to oxygen ratio was found to be very high for hd112869 , c / o @xmath4 12.6 .",
    "the isotopic lines of @xmath20 and cn are too week to be detected in the crowded spectrum and the lower limit of isotopic ratio was found to be extremely high , @xmath79 1500 .",
    "a large isotopic ratio is not typical of cemp stars .",
    "however , for low - mass agb stars the cn processing is not expected after the second dredge - up and a total amount of @xmath80 dredged - up during the agb phase leads to a high [ c / n ] ratio and a high @xmath11 ratio observed for hd112869 . on the contrary , intermediate - mass agb stars with a hot bottom burning ( hbb ) should have low both [ c / n ] and @xmath11 ratios .",
    "mass transfer in a binary system or evolution of a single star on the agb have been proposed to explain the abundance peculiarities observed for hd112869 @xcite .",
    "the semiregular character of radial velocity variations accompanied by color variations rejects the binary status of hd112869 .",
    "@xcite discussed the final stages of evolution on the agb with a small envelope mass to interpret the high c / o and @xmath11 ratios observed for hd112869 .",
    "a carbon to oxygen ratio above 1 , a high luminosity and a pulsational unstability are typical features of cool evolved agb and post - agb stars .",
    "hd112869 , with the luminosity of @xmath81 and the effective temperature of @xmath82 , lies on the agb of metal - poor ( z = 0.0001 ) low mass stars according the evolutionary tracks calculated by @xcite .",
    "during thermal pulses the photospheric c / o ratio can exceed 10 .",
    "the polarization observed in the visual band confirms the presence of circumstellar matter around hd112869 @xcite .",
    "thus , according to the current data , hd112869 seems to be a single metal - poor low mass tp - agb star .",
