    "it has been widely recognized that orbital degree of freedom plays a key role in understanding of novel magnetism observed in transition metal oxides @xcite .",
    "a typical material of such spin - charge - orbital complex is the manganese oxide , exhibiting remarkable colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) phenomena @xcite . in the recent decade , the study of manganites has been one of the most important areas of research in condensed matter physics . in one word ,",
    "the cmr effect is considered to occur when the manganite ground - state changes from insulating to ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic , after a small magnetic field is applied .",
    "based on the concept of two - phase competition , the cmr behavior has been successfully qualitatively reproduced in computational simulations , for instance , employing resistor - network models @xcite . in the two phases ,",
    "the appearance of the fm metallic phase in manganites has been usually rationalized by the so - called double - exchange ( de ) mechanism @xcite , based on a strong hund s rule coupling between mobile @xmath2 electrons and localized @xmath3 spins . on the other hand ,",
    "the insulating phase in manganites is basically understood by the coupling between degenerate @xmath2 electrons and jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions of the mno@xmath8 octahedra @xcite , leading to the various types of charge and/or orbital orders observed experimentally .",
    "the rich phase diagram of manganites has been revealed due to competition and interplay among spin , charge , and orbital degrees of freedom , but a recent trend is to unveil further new phases both from experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "a typical example can be found in the undoped perovskite manganite , rmno@xmath9 with rare earth ion r , which is the mother compound of cmr manganites . for r = la ,",
    "it has been understood clearly that the a - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase appears @xcite with the c - type ordering of @xmath10@xmath11@xmath12- and @xmath13@xmath11@xmath12-orbitals @xcite .",
    "here `` a - type '' denotes a layered antiferro structure with ferro - order in the @xmath14 plane and antiferro - order along the @xmath15 axis , while `` c - type '' indicates a chain - type antiferro structure with antiferro - order in the @xmath14 plane and ferro - order along the @xmath15 axis @xcite .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) for each structure .",
    "theoretically , the a - type ordering has been explained by using several kinds of techniques @xcite . by substituting la by alkaline earth ions such as sr and ca ,",
    "holes are effectively doped into @xmath2-electron band and due to the de mechanism , the fm metallic phase appears with its concomitant cmr effect .",
    "most of the discussion in manganites has centered on the many phases induced by doping with holes the a - type af state , at different values of their bandwidths . in this framework",
    ", it is implicitly assumed that the undoped material is always in the a - type af state .",
    "however , recently , a new af phase has been reported as the ground state in the undoped limit for r = ho @xcite .",
    "this phase is called the `` e - type '' spin structure following the standard notation in this context @xcite .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) for the e - type spin structure .",
    "it is surprising that a new phase can be still found even in the undoped material , previously considered to be well understood .",
    "in addition , the nature of the states obtained by lightly doping this e - phase is totally unknown , and new phenomena may be unveiled experimentally in the near future .",
    "this is believed to open an exciting new branch of investigations in manganites @xcite , since novel phases appear to be hidden in the vast parameter space of these compounds . a clear example has been recently provided by the prediction of a fm charge - ordered ( co ) phase at x=1/2 @xcite , which may have been found experimentally @xcite .",
    "these facts indicate the importance of both experimental and theoretical efforts to unveil new phases in manganites , in addition to the explanation of the complex phases already observed .",
    "such efforts have also been made to find new phases in other transition metal oxides , for instance , ruthenates and nickelates , as we will see later in this article .",
    "concerning rmno@xmath9 with hexagonal structure , quite recently , `` multiferroics '' has been another keyword to understand exotic magnetic phenomena emerging from the multi - phase competition @xcite .",
    "we believe that it is useful to review the nature of spin , charge , and orbital ordered phases of manganites and other transition metal oxides from a unified viewpoint , even though it is true that more work remains to be done to fully understand transition metal oxides , in particular , unusual magneto - transport properties of manganese oxides and appearance of unconventional superconductivity .    a trend to seek for new magnetic as well as",
    "superconducting phases has been also found in the @xmath1-electron system , which is another type of spin - charge - orbital complex @xcite . among",
    "so many kinds of @xmath1-electron materials , in recent years , @xmath1-electron compounds with hocoga@xmath7-type tetragonal crystal structure , frequently referred to as `` 115 '' , have been intensively investigated both in experimental and theoretical research fields of condensed matter physics .",
    "such vigorous activities are certainly motivated by `` high '' temperature superconductivity observed in some 115 compounds .",
    "first , unconventional superconductivity has been found in ce - based 115 compounds , cetin@xmath7 ( t = rh , ir , and co ) .",
    "a surprising point is that cecoin@xmath7 exhibits the superconducting transition temperature @xmath16=2.3k @xcite , which was the highest among yet observed for heavy fermion materials at ambient pressure when it was discovered . on the other hand",
    ", ceirin@xmath7 shows @xmath16=0.4k @xcite which is much less than that of cecoin@xmath7 .",
    "note that cerhin@xmath7 is antiferromagnet with a nel temperature @xmath17=3.8k at ambient pressure , while under high pressure , it becomes superconducting with @xmath16=2.1k @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of superconductivity in ce-115 , the rapid expansion of the research frontier to transuranium systems has been accelerated by the discovery of superconductivity of pu - based 115 compounds , putga@xmath7 ( t = co and rh ) .",
    "it has been reported that @xmath16 of pucoga@xmath7 is 18.5k @xcite , which is amazingly high value even compared with other well - known intermetallic compounds .",
    "the coefficient of electronic specific heat @xmath18 is estimated as @xmath18=77mj / mol@xmath19k@xmath20 , moderately enhanced relative to that for normal metals , suggesting that pucoga@xmath7 should be heavy - fermion superconductor . in purhga@xmath7",
    ", superconductivity has been also found @xcite . although the value of @xmath16=8.7k is lower than that of pucoga@xmath7 , it is still high enough compared with other heavy - fermion superconductors .",
    "quite recently , high quality single crystal purhga@xmath7 has been synthesized @xcite and the ga - nqr measurement has revealed that @xmath0-wave superconductivity is realized in purhga@xmath7 @xcite . the ga - nmr measurement of pucoga@xmath7 is consistent with this conclusion @xcite .",
    "puirga@xmath7 has been also synthesized , but it is considered to be paramagnetic at ambient pressure . at least up to now , there is no indication of superconductivity even under the pressure of 9.5gpa down to 1.4k @xcite .    besides such high temperature superconductivity of ce-115 and pu-115 compounds , interesting magnetic properties",
    "have been reported for utga@xmath7 , where t is a transition metal ion . for several transition metal ions t",
    ", utga@xmath7 are af metals or pauli paramagnets @xcite . among them",
    ", neutron scattering experiments have revealed that uniga@xmath7 exhibits the g - type af phase , while updga@xmath7 and uptga@xmath7 have the a - type af state @xcite .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig6 - 1 ] for the magnetic structure .",
    "note that g - type indicates a three - dimensional nel state @xcite . on the other hand , for utga@xmath7 with t = co , rh , ir , fe , ru , and os , magnetic susceptibility is almost independent of temperature , since these are pauli paramagnets .",
    "it is quite interesting that the magnetic structure is different for u-115 compounds which differ only by the substitution of transition metal ions .",
    "recently , np-115 compounds nptga@xmath7 ( t = fe , co , rh , and ni ) have been also synthesized and several kinds of physical quantities have been successfully measured @xcite . in particular , the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) effect has been observed in npniga@xmath7 @xcite , which is the first observation of dhva signal in transuranium compounds .",
    "quite recently , dhva measurement has been also successfully performed in plutonium compound puin@xmath9 over beyond several kinds of difficulties @xcite . for npcoga@xmath7 and nprhga@xmath7 ,",
    "the dhva oscillations have been also detected and plural number of cylindrical fermi surfaces are found @xcite . for npfega@xmath7 , the magnetic moment at fe site has been suggested in neutron scattering experiments @xcite and it has been also detected by @xmath21fe mssbauer spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the magnetic structure of np-115 compounds also depends sensitively on transition metal ion @xcite : g - af for npniga@xmath7 , a - af for npcoga@xmath7 and nprhga@xmath7 , and c - af for npfega@xmath7 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig6 - 1 ] for the magnetic structure .",
    "note also that in the neutron scattering experiment for npniga@xmath7 , the signal suggesting the g - af grows , after the fm transition occurs @xcite .",
    "this g - af structure is due to canted magnetic moments of np ions .",
    "it is characteristic of u-115 and np-115 compounds that the magnetic properties are sensitive to the choice of transition metal ions .",
    "the appearance of several kinds of af states in u-115 and np-115 compounds reminds us of the magnetic phase diagram of cmr manganites .",
    "thus , we envisage a scenario to understand the complex magnetic structure of actinide compounds based on an orbital degenerate model similar to that of manganites .",
    "however , one must pay due attention to the meanings of `` spin '' and `` orbital '' in @xmath1-electron systems . since they are tightly coupled with each other through a strong spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "distinguishing them is not straightforward in comparison with @xmath0-electron systems .",
    "this point can create serious problems when we attempt to understand microscopic aspects of magnetism and superconductivity in @xmath1-electron compounds .",
    "thus , it is necessary to carefully define the terms `` orbital '' and `` spin '' for @xmath1 electrons in a microscopic discussion of magnetism and superconductivity in @xmath1-electron compounds .    from a conceptual viewpoint , in general",
    ", @xmath1 electrons are more localized in comparison with @xmath0 electrons , but when we turn our attention from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , electronic properties are changed gradually from localized to itinerant nature , leading to rich phenomena which have been recently investigated intensively . in this sense",
    ", it has been also highly requested to push forward the microscopic research on @xmath1 electron systems . however , in sharp contrast to @xmath0 electron systems , the existence of strong spin - orbit coupling has been a problem to develop a theoretical study in the same level as @xmath0-electron research .    in order to overcome such problems , it has been recently proposed to employ a @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme to discuss microscopic aspects of magnetism and superconductivity of @xmath1-electron systems @xcite , on the basis of the relativistic band - structure calculation results @xcite .",
    "there are a couple of advantages of the @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme .",
    "first , it is quite convenient for the inclusion of many - body effects using standard quantum - field theoretical techniques , since individual @xmath1-electron states are clearly defined .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath24 coupling scheme we can not use such standard techniques , since wick s theorem does not hold .",
    "second we can , in principle , include the effects of valence fluctuations . in some uranium compounds ,",
    "the valence of the uranium ion is neither definitely u@xmath25 nor u@xmath26 , indicating that the @xmath1-electron number takes a value between 2 and 3 . in the @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme",
    "this is simply regarded as the average number of @xmath1 electron per uranium ion .    as we will discuss later in detail , with the use of the @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme , it is possible to establish the microscopic hamiltonian for @xmath1-electron systems . in particular , under crystalline electric field of cubic symmetry ,",
    "the @xmath1-electron model on the basis of the @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme can be reduced to the orbital degenerate model , which is equivalent to the @xmath2 electron hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the common microscopic model for @xmath0- and @xmath1-electron compounds is a simple explanation for the appearance of magnetic structure in common with manganites and actinide 115 compounds , as actually analyzed by using numerical calculations @xcite . in order to understand unconventional superconductivity of ce-115 and pu-115 materials ,",
    "the orbital degenerate model has been also analyzed with the use of a fluctuation - exchange approximation to include effectively spin and orbital fluctuations @xcite . a possible scenario for odd - parity triplet superconductivity induced by the hund",
    "s rule interaction has been discussed based on the orbital degenerate model on the non - bravais lattice such as honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "novel magnetism and exotic superconductivity of filled skutterudite materials @xcite have been discussed by using the microscopic model on the basis of the @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the same orbital physics should work between @xmath0- and @xmath1-electron systems , after the application of the @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme to @xmath1-electron materials .",
    "this is an important clue to establish the unified picture , which penetrates complex phenomena both in @xmath0- and @xmath1-electron compounds .",
    "another advantage of the model on the basis of the @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling is that it is possible to develop a microscopic theory for multipole ordering of @xmath1-electron materials .",
    "recently , ordering of high - order multipole such as octupole has been intensively discussed for ce@xmath27la@xmath28b@xmath8 @xcite and for npo@xmath4 @xcite to reconcile experimental observations which seem to contradict one another at first glance .",
    "very recently , a possibility of octupole ordering has been also proposed for smru@xmath5p@xmath29 @xcite . here",
    "we note that spin and orbital degrees of freedom correspond to dipole and quadrupole moment , respectively .",
    "the microscopic aspects of octupole ordering has not been discussed satisfactorily in the context of electronic models .",
    "rather , phenomenological theories have been developed under the assumption that octupole ordering occurs .",
    "note that direct detection of octupole ordering is very difficult , since the octupole moment directly couples to neither a magnetic field nor lattice distortions .",
    "however , those phenomenological theories have successfully explained several experimental facts consistently , e.g. , induced quadrupole moments in octupole ordered states in ce@xmath27la@xmath28b@xmath8 @xcite and npo@xmath4 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been highly required to proceed to microscopic theory , in order to understand the origin of multipole ordering in @xmath1-electron systems over beyond the phenomenological level .    concerning this issue ,",
    "recently , it has been clearly shown that the model based on the @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme also works for the explanation of octupole ordering @xcite .",
    "it is possible to obtain the multipole interaction from the @xmath1-electron model , by applying the same procedure to derive the orbital - dependent superexchange interaction in @xmath0-electron systems .",
    "namely , we can provide the microscopic basis for multipole interaction .",
    "it is also possible to show the stability of octupole ordered phase depending on the lattice structure . in this scenario , octupole is the combined degree of freedom of spin and orbital . in another word ,",
    "octupole is considered to be characterized by the anisotropic spin densities .",
    "thus , the difference in anisotropic up- and down - spin densities naturally provide the magnetic moment of octupole .",
    "it is one of progresses in orbital physics that higher - order multipole can be also understood in the context of spin and orbital ordering phenomena .    in this article , in sec .  2 , we review the construction of the microscopic models for @xmath0-electron systems in detail .",
    "then , we arrive at three kinds of hamiltonians , depending on the active orbitals , which are ( i ) @xmath2-electron doubly degenerate model , ( ii ) @xmath3-electron triply degenerate model , and ( iii ) @xmath2-orbital double - exchange model coupled with @xmath3 localized spins . in sec .  3 , in order to explain the orbital ordering in manganites , we focus on the theoretical results on the model ( iii ) .",
    "in particular , the topological aspects of orbital ordering will be discussed in detail .",
    "then , we explain characteristic features of orbital ordering depending on hole doping x in subsections for x=0.0 , x=0.5 , x@xmath300.5 , and x@xmath310.5 . in sec .  4",
    ", we discuss the results of models ( i ) and ( ii ) , by introducing nickelates and ruthenates as typical materials , respectively . in sec .  5 , we will move on to the model construction for @xmath1-electron materials with the use of the @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme .",
    "we will explain the spirit of the @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme in detail , in comparison with the @xmath24 coupling scheme .",
    "then , we establish the orbital degenerate model for @xmath1-electron systems . in sec .",
    "6 , we will show theoretical results on the microscopic model for @xmath1-electron systems .",
    "we will explain possible orbital ordering of 115 compounds and octupole ordering of npo@xmath4 from a microscopic viewpoint . finally , in sec .  7 , we will summarize this article .",
    "before proceeding to the description of theoretical results on orbital ordering phenomena in @xmath0-electron compounds , first it is necessary to define the model hamiltonian for @xmath0-electron systems .",
    "the model should be composed of three parts as @xmath32 where @xmath33 expresses the kinetic term of @xmath0 electrons , @xmath34 denotes the local term for @xmath0 electrons , and @xmath35 indicates the inter - site interaction among @xmath0 electrons , which is not fully included by the combination of @xmath33 and @xmath34 . among them , the local term @xmath34 includes three important ingredients , written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the crystalline electric field ( cef ) term , @xmath38 denotes the coulomb interactions among @xmath0 electrons , and @xmath39 indicates the coupling term between @xmath0 electrons and lattice distortions .",
    "the full hamiltonian includes several competing tendencies and couplings , but as shown below , the essential physics can be obtained using relatively simple models , deduced from the complicated full hamiltonian .      in order to construct the model hamiltonian for @xmath0-electron systems , let us start our discussion at the level of the atomic problem , in which just one electron occupies a certain orbital in the @xmath40 shell of a transition metal ion . in the next subsection , we will include the effect of coulomb interactions among @xmath0 electrons .",
    "for an isolated ion , a five - fold degeneracy exists for the occupation of the @xmath40 orbitals , but this degeneracy is partially lifted by the cef potential from anions surrounding the transition metal ion . since it is the electrostatic potential field acting on one electron state even in the complicated crystal structure , the cef potential should be , in any case , given in the second - quantized form as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the annihilation operator for a @xmath0-electron with spin @xmath43 in the @xmath44-orbital at site @xmath45 , @xmath44(=@xmath46 ) is the @xmath47-component of angular momentum @xmath48(=2 ) , and @xmath49 is the coefficient of the cef potential , depending on the crystal structure and the angular momentum .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath49 has been analyzed in detail by the ligand field theory .",
    "here we briefly explain the derivation of @xmath49 by following the procedure of hutchings @xcite .",
    "the cef potential is given by the sum of electro - static potential from anions surrounding the transition metal ion , written by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the valence of anion , @xmath52 is elementary electric charge , @xmath53 denotes the position of @xmath54-th anion , and @xmath55 indicates the position of @xmath40 electron around the nucleus of transition metal ion .",
    "then , the cef coefficient is evaluated by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the wavefunction of @xmath0 electron , expressed as @xmath58 with @xmath55=@xmath59 in the polar coordinate .",

    "@xmath63 is in the order of bohr radius , while @xmath64 is related to the lattice constant which is in the order of several angstroms .",

    "<S> in recent decades , novel magnetism of @xmath0- and @xmath1-electron compounds has been discussed very intensively both in experimental and theoretical research fields of condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recognized that those material groups are in the same category of strongly correlated electron systems , while the low - energy physics of @xmath0- and @xmath1-electron compounds has been separately investigated rather in different manners . </S>",
    "<S> one of common features of both @xmath0- and @xmath1-electron systems is certainly the existence of active orbital degree of freedom , but in @xmath1-electron materials , due to the strong spin - orbit interaction in rare - earth and actinide ions , the physics seems to be quite different from that of @xmath0-electron systems . in general , when the number of internal degrees of freedom and relevant interactions is increased , it is possible to obtain rich phase diagram including large varieties of magnetic phases by using several kinds of theoretical techniques . </S>",
    "<S> however , we should not be simply satisfied with the reproduction of rich phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that more essential point is to seek for a simple principle penetrating complicated phenomena in common with @xmath0- and @xmath1-electron materials , which opens the door to a new stage in orbital physics . in this sense , it is considered to be an important task of this article to explain common features of magnetism in @xmath0- and @xmath1-electron systems from a microscopic viewpoint , using a key concept of orbital ordering , in addition to the review of the complex phase diagram of each material group . as a typical @xmath0-electron complex material exhibiting orbital order , first we focus on perovskite manganites , in which remarkable colossal magneto - resistance effect has been intensively studied . </S>",
    "<S> the manganites provide us a good stage to understand that a simple mechanism works for the formation of complex spin , charge , and orbital ordering . </S>",
    "<S> we also explain intriguing striped charge ordering on the orbital - ordered background in nickelates and the effect of orbital ordering to resolve spin frustration in geometrically frustrated @xmath2 electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> note that orbital ordering phenomena are also found in @xmath3 electron systems . here </S>",
    "<S> we review recent advances in the understanding of orbital ordering phenomenon in ca@xmath4ruo@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> next we discuss another spin - charge - orbital complex system such as @xmath1-electron compound . </S>",
    "<S> after the detailed explanation of the construction of microscopic models on the basis of a @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme , we introduce a @xmath0-electron - like scenario to understand novel magnetism in some actinide compounds with the hocoga@xmath7-type tetragonal crystal structure . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that complicated multipole order can be understood from the spin - orbital model on the basis of the @xmath6-@xmath6 coupling scheme . as a typical material with multipole order , we pick up npo@xmath4 which has been believed to exhibit peculiar octupole order . throughout this review </S>",
    "<S> , it is emphasized that the same orbital physics works both in @xmath0- and @xmath1-electron complex materials in spite of the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals . </S>"
