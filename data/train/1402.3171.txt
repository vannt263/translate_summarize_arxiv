    "this work is dedicated to the memory of gerry brown who has charted and shaped up the frontiers of nuclear physics for about half a century .",
    "dibaryons , among many other topical subjects , fascinated gerry and he has contributed imaginatively to this subject , too .",
    "we feel honored to add our modest contribution to this memorial issue of nuclear physics a.",
    "non - strange @xmath12-wave dibaryon resonances @xmath13 with isospin @xmath14 and spin @xmath15 were predicted by dyson and xuong @xcite in 1964 as early as su(6 ) symmetry for baryons , placing the nucleon @xmath16 and its @xmath17 @xmath18 resonance @xmath19 in the same @xmath20 multiplet , proved successful .",
    "these authors chose the @xmath21 lowest - dimension su(6 ) multiplet in the @xmath22 direct product containing the su(3)-flavor @xmath23 and @xmath24 multiplets in which the deuteron @xmath25 and @xmath26 virtual state @xmath27 are classified .",
    "this gave four non - strange dibaryon candidates with masses listed in table  [ tab : dyson ] in terms of constants @xmath28 .",
    "identifying @xmath29 with the @xmath26 threshold mass 1878  mev , the value @xmath30  mev was derived by assigning @xmath31 to the @xmath32 coupled - channel resonance behavior noted then at 2160  mev , near the @xmath1 threshold ( nominally 2.171  mev ) .",
    "this led in particular to a predicted mass @xmath33  mev for @xmath34 , followed since 1977 by many quark - based model calculations as reviewed by us recently @xcite .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : dij ]    the @xmath34 and @xmath11 are not the only @xmath2 dibaryon candidates found as resonances in our faddeev calculations . in table  [ tab : dij ] we list all the @xmath36 resonance poles found using the best - fit @xmath37 for two choices of the @xmath18 form factor @xmath38 .",
    "averaged results are also listed .",
    "the table suggests that in addition to the ( @xmath39 ) doublet , the lowest of all @xmath2 dibaryon doublets , two additional @xmath40 doublets are found several tens of mev higher in energy and are twice or more as broad : ( @xmath41 ) , where the asterisk distinguishes these excited @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 resonances from the lower ( @xmath45 ) @xmath1 dibaryon resonances of sect .",
    "[ sec : ndel ] , and the ( @xmath46 ) doublet of resonances . to understand this hierarchy we recall that by eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) the kernel @xmath47 ( [ eq11 ] ) is roughly proportional to the squares of the recoupling coefficients @xmath48 . for @xmath34 and @xmath11 the squares of the only nonvanishing coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , assume the maximal value 1 . for the other two doublets ,",
    "several nonvanishing coefficients contribute with average square about 0.5 , so that the effective interactions in these systems are weaker than for @xmath34 and @xmath11 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the nonresonant dibaryon candidates @xmath51 and @xmath52 the squares of their only nonvanishing coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , are 0.125 each , exceedingly small to form resonances .    in order to understand the mechanism for the relatively small widths of @xmath34 and @xmath11 , recall the formulation of the three - body @xmath55 model and its @xmath56 coupled - channel description around eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) , where @xmath57 corresponds to a three - channel @xmath58 isobar .",
    "the decay of @xmath34 and @xmath11 through the upper @xmath59 channel can proceed only via the @xmath2 subchannel .",
    "in particular , the strong decay expected from the @xmath60 subchannel is forbidden and the resulting effective decay width is reduced to @xmath61(0.30.5)@xmath62 in terms of the free - space @xmath63 decay width @xmath64  mev .",
    "similar suppression should have occurred for the decay width of @xmath65 , but its higher mass provides larger phase space for decay , also elastically to the @xmath66 channel .",
    "finally , the @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 dibaryon resonances are allowed to decay through all of the @xmath70 subchannels and their decay width is not suppressed with respect to @xmath62 .",
    "a unified hadronic approach to the calculation of non - strange dibaryon candidates was presented in this work .",
    "the building blocks of the model here applied are nucleons , @xmath63 s and pions , the latter playing a special role . apart from generating long - range pion - exchange interactions , as in the first diagram on the r.h.s . of the ls equation fig .",
    "[ fig : pinn ] , the pion forms a @xmath63 resonance by scattering off a nucleon , thereby linking the two baryons of the model .",
    "a @xmath5 three - body model was formulated in terms of faddeev equations to explore @xmath1 dibaryons .",
    "separable interactions were fitted to scattering phase shifts in the dominant @xmath26 @xmath12-wave channels and the @xmath18 @xmath17 channel . with this input , the @xmath5 faddeev equations were solved using relativistic kinematics .",
    "resonance poles in the @xmath71 @xmath1 channels were found nominally below threshold and were attributed to the @xmath1 dibaryon candidates @xmath72 predicted by dyson and xuong @xcite .",
    "the calculated @xmath3 resonance mass and width agree closely with those extracted phenomenologically from @xmath26 and @xmath73 scattering and reaction data @xcite .",
    "the existence of the  exotic \" @xmath74 resonance , in contrast , lacks experimental support or phenomenological evidence because with isospin @xmath75 it is decoupled from @xmath26 scattering data .",
    "of course , given the proximity of these nearly degenerate @xmath1 resonances to the @xmath1 threshold , and given that their widths are similar to that of a free @xmath63 , it is not an easy task to distinguish them from @xmath1 threshold effects .    to study @xmath2 dibaryons we formulated a @xmath55 three - body model with pairwise separable interactions in the dominant @xmath18 @xmath17 channel , as above , and in the @xmath76 dibaryon @xmath71 resonating channels .",
    "the @xmath3 interaction was constrained by the @xmath26 @xmath77 scattering data without explicitly assuming it to resonate .",
    "special care was taken to ensure that the inverse - range parameters @xmath78 of the @xmath76 interaction satisfy the constraint @xmath79",
    "@xmath80 to be consistent with the exclusion of explicit vector mesons and shorter - range degrees of freedom from our long - range physics model .",
    "the @xmath3 interaction was also employed in the @xmath4 channel in most of the reported calculations . with these input two - body interactions ,",
    "the @xmath55 faddeev equations were solved , allowing the @xmath63 constituent of the model to acquire decay width compatible with the requirements of quantum statistics with respect to the pion and nucleon constituents of the model .",
    "several @xmath36 dibaryon resonances were found below the @xmath2 threshold , notably the ( @xmath39 ) doublet , with @xmath34 the lowest dibaryon at complex energy value 2363@xmath81i33  mev , where the theoretical uncertainty of its mass and width values is estimated by @xmath8220  mev , in good agreement with the resonance observed by wasa@cosy in double - pion production @xmath83 reactions @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that our long - range physics model calculations reproduce the two nonstrange dibaryons established experimentally and phenomenologically so far , the @xmath1 dibaryon @xmath31 @xcite and the @xmath2 dibaryon @xmath34 reported by the wasa@cosy collaboration @xcite . among the other dibaryon candidates predicted to resonate in our model calculations , the broad @xmath84 ( @xmath85140  mev ) deserves attention",
    ". it would be useful to place constraints on the appearance of this dibaryon candidate in partial - wave analyses of the @xmath26 @xmath77 wave . the other predicted dibaryons , a relatively narrow @xmath86 ( @xmath8565  mev ) and a doublet of broad resonances ( @xmath46 ) at 2440 mev ( @xmath85160170  mev ) are all  exotic \" in the sense that their high value of isospin forbids them to couple to @xmath26 partial waves . among these  exotic \" dibaryon candidates",
    ", @xmath86 is particularly interesting .",
    "it was highlighted recently by bashkanov , brodsky and clement @xcite who focused attention to the special but unspecified role played by six - quark hidden - color configurations in forming the ( @xmath87 ) dibaryon resonances .",
    "however , the recent quark - based calculations by huang , ping and wang @xcite conclude that such configurations enhance binding by merely 15@xmath825  mev , which is within the theoretical uncertainty claimed in our hadronic - basis calculations .",
