    "many bacteria including species found in diverse soil and water environments are able to spread rapidly over surfaces by the process of swarming which is the collective motion of many thousands of cells .",
    "the bacteria capable of swarming span the gamut of utilit and range from innocuous carbon - cycle organisms to harmful pathogens .",
    "swarming can be achieved by directional movement from pulling with type iv pili and either propulsion from rotating flagella or pushing from secretion of slime @xcite . in certain cases ,",
    "these mechanisms work together and allow the cells to swarm at a rate faster than each individual type of motility @xcite .",
    "for example , _ myxococcus xanthus _ , ubiquitous bacteria found in soil , are very efficient swarmers . these bacteria have elongated rod - type shapes ( about @xmath2 in length and @xmath3 in width ) and they move by gliding over a substrate in the direction of their longer axis @xcite .",
    "they align and travel together in the same direction ( see figure [ experimentimages]a ) as well as reverse direction of their motion about every eight minutes @xcite .",
    "mutant species of myxobacteria that are unable to reverse are also unable to swarm @xcite .",
    "after agar plate is inoculated in the center with _ m. xanthus _ , they start growing and moving , and the swarm expands .",
    "90% of the expansion is caused by cell movement and only 10% by growth @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a reversal period of @xmath4 maximizes the expansion rate for a given average cell velocity of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "such motion is limited by new cells moving out from the center .",
    "therefore , a cell in many cases can not move full 8 minutes in the direction towards the center .",
    "when encountering a cell moving in opposite direction cell stops and waits till it is time to start moving again away from the center .",
    "the swarm grows symmetrically in all directions ( see figure [ experimentimages]b ) .",
    "the symmetry dictates that there is a net movement only in radial directions .",
    "the expansion rate of a wild type _ m. xanthus _ ( a+s+ ) swarm ( which moves using both pili vi and slime engine ) is @xmath6 while the average velocity of individual myxobacteria is @xmath7 @xcite . because cells reverse periodically , it is possible to say that @xmath8 of their energy is used for swarming . also , large aspect ratio of cells and their ability to bend promote bacterial alignment which also increases swarming .",
    "velocities of mutants ( a - s+ ) and ( a+s+ ) are equal to the velocity of the wild type bacteria ( a+s+ ) .",
    "recent two - dimensional ( 2d ) off - lattice microscopic stochastic model ( msm ) described in @xcite , has been able to predict optimal reversal rates for specific choices of bacterial velocities and aspect ratios leading to the maximal swarming rates of the colony , which were confirmed in experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown in @xcite that such choice of the optimal reversal rate allows cells to align better and resolve traffic jams resulting in the maximal order of alignment .",
    "the model takes into account cell shape and direction of motion of each myxobacteria in the colony determined by the two motility mechanisms : pili vi and slime production .",
    "such detailed cell description is computationally intense and makes any analytical description difficult .",
    "experimental observations suggest that the capacity to swarm depends less on the motility engine employed by individual cells and instead on the behavioral algorithms that enhance the flow of densely packed cells @xcite . because of that we focus in this paper on the study of self - propelled motion of rod shaped bacteria without specifying motility engines .",
    "we do not incorporate cell division , the directional effects of slime , or the social motility governed by pili into the model .",
    "instead we use a basic model for studying mechanism of swarming caused by the cell - cell collisions ( jams ) and regular cell reversals , in a small part of the colony near the edge of the swarm where motion of bacteria is nearly one - dimensional in the radial direction ( see fig .",
    "[ experimentimages ] ) .",
    "we assume that cells can not climb onto each other and that no more than one cell could be positioned at any moment in time at specific location in space ( by using excluded volume constraint ) .",
    "cells are modeled as self - propelled bending rods which glide on slime on the substrate with the same constant velocity .",
    "they reverse direction of their motion periodically in time which serves as a mechanism for diffusion of spatial positions of cells .",
    "the main result of the paper is an establishment of a connection between one - dimensional ( 1d ) microscopic and macroscopic models and and their parameters , describing swarming of bacteria reversing at different frequencies .",
    "microscopic 1d discrete stochastic model is a 1d simplified version of the full 2d model @xcite .",
    "1d macroscopic model is a nonlinear diffusion equation for cellular density describing dynamics of self - propelled non - overlapping rods with regular reversals .",
    "combination of a stochastic discrete model and its continuous limit in the form of a nonlinear diffusion equation constitutes a multi - scale modeling environment which allows one to zoom in and study individual bacteria and then zoom out and investigate emerging behavior of a large number of bacteria in a swarming colony .",
    "although , only few continuous models based on biological cell behavior exist which take volume of cells into account and prevent cells from overlapping , such models are more biologically relevant and can provide novel insights .",
    "recently continuous limit models describing dynamics of cellular density were derived from the microscopic motion of randomly moving cells exhibiting volume exclusion and chemotaxis @xcite . in particular ,",
    "@xcite introduces a nonlinear diffusion equation model with chemotactic term for describing amoeba aggregation without blow up of solution in finite time @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the standard but biologically less realistic keller - segel equation ( sometimes also called patlak - keller - segel equation ) with constant diffusion coefficient @xcite which neglects the size of bacteria resulting in solution ( bacterial density ) having a blow up ( collapse ) in finite time @xcite .",
    "another 1d continuous limit equation was recently derived from a model of cells that interact using hooke s law @xcite .",
    "this equation also displays nonlinear fast diffusion , and looks similar to the porous medium equation but with a negative exponent .",
    "this model agrees well with the discrete system from which it is derived and it is capable of effectively making biological predictions for cells that can be modeled as stiff springs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : microscopicstochasticmodelcellmotion ] a microscopic stochastic model ( msm ) of cellular dynamics is introduced which describes 1d motion of sell - propelled rods with periodic in time reversals of the direction of their motion . in section",
    "[ section : msmsimulations ] general settings for msm simulations are presented and results of multiple 1d dynamics msm simulations with initially localized distributions of bacterial colonies are described . in section [ section : elementarycollisions ] elementary laws of collisions ( jams ) between cells are derived and equilibrium motion of cells is determined in the limit of zero noise of the reversal period . without interactions ( in a vanishing cell density limit )",
    "each cell experiences almost periodic motion in space and time . without a noise in the reversal time that motion",
    "would be strictly periodic .",
    "however , the experimentally observed @xcite small noise in the reversal time results in the random walk of the average position ( averaged over time period @xmath9 ) of the center of mass of each cell at time scales above @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the average reversal time for each cell . for finite cellular densities",
    "we introduce different types of collisions ( jams ) between cells including pairwise jam and cluster jam .",
    "we also find the critical density @xmath0 below which cellular diffusion is dominated by the diffusion ( random walk ) of individual cells while above @xmath0 the diffusion is dominated by the collisions between cells . in section [ section : multiplecollisions ] multiple collisions and cell clustering for large cellular densities are studied . in section [ section : macroscopicnonlineardiffusionmodelvsmsmsimulations ] a nonlinear diffusion equation of the general form @xmath11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is introduced , where @xmath12 is a local cell density ( measured in units of volume fraction , i.e. the ratio of volume occupied by cells to the total volume of space ) , @xmath13 is the spatial coordinate and @xmath14 is the nonlinear diffusion coefficient determined by using boltzmann - matano ( bm ) analysis @xcite of ensemble averaged msm simulations of cells moving with different reversal frequencies .",
    "the equation ( [ nonlineardiffusion1 ] ) gives microscopically averaged dynamics of cellular density vs. microscopic description of msm model .",
    "we compare the dynamics of cellular density from msm simulations with the numerical solutions of the equation ( [ nonlineardiffusion1 ] ) for different reversal frequencies and find very good agreement between these two types of simulations for @xmath1 .",
    "this confirms that the dynamics of cellular density is indeed of a nonlinear diffusion type ( [ nonlineardiffusion1 ] ) . in section [ section : analyticalapproximation ]",
    "an analytical approximation for pairwise collision time and semi - analytical fit for the total jam time per reversal period are described . in section [ section : conclusiondiscussion ] main results of the paper and future directions are discussed . in appendix a boltzmann - matano analysis is reviewed .",
    "appendix b provides additional testing of the accuracy of boltzmann - matano approach for the cellular distributions of finite size .",
    "in this section we introduce a computational discrete microscopic stochastic model ( msm ) of cellular dynamics describing motion of self - propelled rods on a 1d lattice with periodic in time reversals of the direction of their motion .",
    "we simulate constant number of cells of length @xmath15 that move back ( left ) and forth ( right ) in a spatial domain along the coordinate @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions and velocity @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that each cell reverses the direction of its motion in average time @xmath10 after previous reversal .",
    "the reversal period experiences fluctuations with the variance @xmath17 which are sharply peaked near @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath18 in accordance with the observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "assume that the positive integer @xmath19 corresponds to the @xmath19th reversal of the given cell .",
    "we chose the probability distribution for the stochastic realizations of the reversal time @xmath20 for @xmath19th reversal to be defined through the poisson distribution @xmath21 as follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "because the statistical averages for ( [ poisson1 ] ) are @xmath25 and @xmath26 we obtain that @xmath27 and @xmath28 . with that definition",
    "the stochastic realizations of @xmath20 can take only discrete values @xmath29 .",
    "but because we assume @xmath18 we conclude that this is a good approximation of the myxobacteria reversals with continues set of values of the reversal time .    to quantify the difference between reversal times of neighboring bacteria we introduce the reversal phase for each bacteria defined as follows .",
    "we define time periods @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 etc . inside each of these intervals",
    "each cell ( bacteria ) has an assigned reversal phase , @xmath33 , between @xmath34 and @xmath9 corresponding to the time when cell reverses from moving to the right to the motion to the left ( i.e. cell reverses from right - directed motion to the left - directed at times @xmath35 ) .",
    "reversal in opposite direction occurs at at times @xmath36 .",
    "the initial phase of each cell is chosen at random . here",
    "the phase @xmath33 is not constant but changes after each reversal because of fluctuations of @xmath20 .",
    "the condition @xmath18 ensure that the change of @xmath33 at the time scale @xmath10 is small . respectively , at much larger time scale @xmath37 the phase @xmath33 experiences the random walk .",
    "these random walks are independent for for each of @xmath38 cells in the system .    in dimensionless units we assume that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "unless otherwise specified we choose @xmath41 . each cell",
    "is represented by a finite number of lattice sites on a 1d grid . in a typical simulation ,",
    "each cell includes 10 lattice sites , i.e. distance between neighboring lattice sites is @xmath42 ( see figure [ cellsketch ] a ) .",
    "time step in dimensionless units is @xmath43 to keep the velocity @xmath40 .",
    "however , we also ran multiple simulations with smaller values of @xmath44 to make sure that increasing number of lattice sites per cell ( but keeping @xmath39 and decreasing time step to keep @xmath40 ) does not significantly change our results .",
    "in other words , we look at the continuous limit as @xmath45 the following three dimensionless parameters completely determine the dynamics of cells in continuous limit @xmath45 the first parameter is @xmath46 which is the ratio of the average distance traveled by cells between reversals and the cell length . that parameter is @xmath47 for the typical value @xmath41 .",
    "the second dimensionless parameter is the local cellular density @xmath12 measured in units of volume fraction @xmath48 , i.e. the ratio of volume occupied by cells to the total volume of space ( in 1d , volume is simply the length ) .",
    "the third parameter is @xmath49 , i.e. relative size of the reversal time fluctuations .",
    "for example , we can choose the velocity , the reversal period , the fluctuation of the reversal period and the cellular length as @xmath50 , @xmath51min , @xmath52min and @xmath53 , respectively , in dimensional units .",
    "this yields @xmath54 similar to the typical dimensionless values chosen above .",
    "this choice is consistent with cell lengths and reversal period used in previous computational models @xcite and observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "below unless otherwise specified we choose @xmath55 .",
    "for @xmath41 it corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "experiments with myxobacteria typically show only small fluctuations of the reversal period @xmath10 so that probability distribution function is sharply peaked near average reversal period @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "our typical choice @xmath56 reflects that smallness of fluctuations .",
    "we also checked that if there is no noise added to the reversal period , the simulations fails to match the nonlinear diffusion equation ( [ nonlineardiffusion1 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that noise ( although small ) in the reversal period of bacteria contributes to their macroscopic behavior by allowing them to behave diffusively .",
    "+    at each time step , the model determines cell movement based on the occupancy of the next lattice site in the direction the cell is moving ( direction is determined by @xmath33 at the given time @xmath57 ) .",
    "if this location is free , the cell is moved 1 lattice site in that direction ( keeping constant length @xmath39 ) .",
    "if the location is not free , the cell does not move .",
    "the model itself is stochastic . during each time step , a sequence of @xmath38 randomly chosen cells attempt to move one at a time , where @xmath38 is the total number of cells .",
    "it is possible that the same cell may move more than once during a time step , and as a result some other cells may not move at all .",
    "also , note that random selection of cells may create gaps between cells that are following each other ( see figures [ cellsketch]b and [ cellsketch]c for examples of possible cellular movement ) .",
    "creation of such gaps is equivalent to the extra diffusion each cell experiences in addition to the directed motion with the speed @xmath16 .",
    "that diffusion is a pure artefact of the finite width @xmath58 of each lattice site which vanishes as @xmath59 we checked in simulations that reduction of @xmath44 from 0.1 to 0.001 gives only small changes in the cellular density dynamics ( see section [ section : macroscopicnonlineardiffusionmodelvsmsmsimulationssubsectionb ] for more discussion on that ) .",
    "however , the collision time between cells is more sensitive to the value of @xmath44 so for these type of simulations in section [ section : analyticalapproximation ] we also used grid spacing down to @xmath60 . generally , in all quantities plotted in all figures of the paper we choose @xmath61 unless we explicitly specify a different value of @xmath44 .",
    "unless otherwise specified , the simulations are run on a one - dimensional lattice domain of length @xmath62 centered at @xmath63 starting with an initial top - hat distribution of cells of width @xmath64 also centered at @xmath63 ( i.e. density of cells is approximately constant @xmath65 for @xmath66 and zero everywhere else ) .",
    "see curve for @xmath67 in figure [ 8reversalperiod]a as example of a top - hat boundary condition . because the domain is symmetric between @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath68 it replicates a no - flux boundary condition at @xmath63 after averaging over the statistical ensemble of simulations .",
    "generally , we choose lattice domain of length large enough to have no influence of the periodic boundaries ( i.e. to have zero cellular density at both right and left boundaries ) .",
    "swarming of bacterial colony similar to the one shown in figure [ experimentimages]a can be analyzed by averaging over angles , i.e. as an average over dynamics of many nearly 1d ( in the radial direction ) distributions of myxobacteria . in what follows",
    "we assume that motion along radius is a dominant one while rotation is only a correction which we neglect here .",
    "we performed multiple msm simulations of 1d dynamics of initially localized distributions of bacterial density and performed ensemble averaging over these simulations .",
    "the ensemble serves to approximate averaging over angles or the full 2d problem .",
    "we choose the `` top - hat '' initial distribution ( constant density around the center of the domain and zero density to the left and to the right of the center ) .",
    "initial top - hat density profile was typically obtained by a dense initial packing of bacteria in the domain of width 1000 around @xmath63 .",
    "the typical size of a statistical ensemble was @xmath69 .",
    "we determined the cellular density ( volume fraction ) by calculating the average number of times the given location was occupied ( see figure [ 8reversalperiod]a ) . qualitatively , the cell densities spread out symmetrically away from the center of the top hat . for later times",
    "a steep slope develops around density @xmath70 , which implies that the rate at which the density spreads out depends on the local cell density .",
    "+    the cells movement frequently causes them to collide with each other .",
    "when two cells are trying to move into each other s space , they stall ( jam ) until at least one reverses .",
    "this stalling , on average , shifts the mean location of their oscillatory movement away from the location at which they stall .",
    "if no other cells are nearby , the cells may collide again or separate further away due to fluctuations in the mean location of their oscillatory movement . if other cells are nearby , these outer cells have their mean location shifted outwards while the original cells mean locations are shifted closer together . through these shifts ,",
    "the cells steadily spread away from each other .    in highly packed situations ,",
    "the cells cluster together .",
    "two cells can jam together forming two - cell cluster , and if another cell is moving in a direction of a that two - cell cluster then it may join the cluster forming three - cell cluster etc . to measure the amount of clustering , we calculated the frequencies of cluster sizes at different moments of time which is shown in log - log plots in figure ( [ 8reversalperiod]b ) for msm simulations with top - hat initial conditions .",
    "it is seen that the frequency of cluster sizes follows @xmath71 power law .",
    "it is seen that the average cluster size decreases over time as initially densely packed cells expand .",
    "figure ( [ 8reversalperiod]c ) shows that this decrease follows a power law decay over time with calculated exponent @xmath72 which is close to @xmath73 power laws expected from diffusion .",
    "this suggests that during early times , many of the cells are found in large clusters where they can not move . at later times",
    ", the large clusters rapidly break up into smaller clusters allowing cells to move .",
    "also , the individual cells near the boundaries spend a significantly greater percentage of their time moving .",
    "figure [ 8reversalperiod]a shows that the dynamics of the cellular density is smooth and slow compare with the velocity @xmath40 of individual cell motion .",
    "it suggests the ensemble averaged distribution of cells at each moment of time and at each point in space is in statistical quasi - equilibrium .",
    "below we study dependence of quasi - equilibrium on local cellular density , cellular collision times and cluster sizes .",
    "we also performed a second type of msm simulations with periodic boundary conditions and uniform average densities to study statistical equilibrium of cellular motion .",
    "if the noise in the reversal time @xmath10 is absent then in a vanishing cell density limit each cell experiences periodic motion in space and time with its center of mass not moving on average ( after averaging over time period @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , the experimentally observed @xcite small noise in the reversal time results in the random walk of the average position ( averaged over time period @xmath9 ) of the center of mass of each cell at time scales above @xmath9 .",
    "that random walk results in collisions of cells for any finite density .",
    "as density goes to zero these collisions become more and more rear because it takes more time for cells to span the average distance between them through random walk .",
    "below in this section we consider the limit when we completely neglect that random walk , i.e. we neglect the noise in @xmath10 .    for nonzero density of cells",
    ", there is a finite probability for two neighboring cells to collide ( jam ) . by jam , we mean that one cell tries to move where another cell is located , but the excluded volume principle prevents them from moving .",
    "the term `` jam  in this paper is similar to the term ' ' collision \" .",
    "the subtle difference is that by collision we mean that a cell jams with another cell with subsequent unjamming , i.e. the cell is free to move after a jam .",
    "we distinguish two types of jams .",
    "first type is a  _ pairwise jam _ \" .",
    "it occurs when two neighboring cells are jammed directly because they try to move in opposite directions towards each other but that motion is prevented by the excluded volume principle .",
    "second type of jam occurs when a cell 1 tries to move in the same direction as a neighboring cell 2 but that cell 2 is jammed by another cell(s ) ( e.g. by cell 3 ) .",
    "we refer to such type of a jam of cell 1 as  _ indirect jam _ \" .",
    "such jam is an indirect one because there is no direct ( pairwise ) jam between cells 1 and 2 .",
    "a typical example is when cell 1 moves towards neighboring cell 2 while cells 2 and 3 have a pairwise jam .",
    "after cell 1 touches cell 2 they together ( cells 1,2 and 3 ) form three - cell cluster with pairwise jam between cells 2 and 3 and indirect jam with cell 1 .",
    "we also say that a given cell is in a ",
    "_ cluster jam _ \" if it is either pairwise or indirect jam .",
    "the pairwise collision time @xmath74 is always smaller or equal to @xmath10 because of reversal of the direction of cellular motion .",
    "in contrast , the cluster jam time @xmath75 can be arbitrary large if cells stay inside of a large cluster .",
    "also in section [ section : analyticalapproximation ] we use total jam time @xmath76 per period @xmath10 , i.e. the time during which a given cell remains jammed ( either directly or indirectly ) per period @xmath10 . with such definition @xmath76",
    "never exceeds @xmath10 .",
    "assume that density is small so that mostly pairwise jams occur .",
    "in such a case jamming of two cells lasts until one of the cells reverses .",
    "after that they move together in the same direction until the second cell reverses .",
    "after the second cell reversal , cells move in opposite directions away from each other .",
    "assume that all other cells are still far away . then after the first cell reverses for a second time both cells will move in the same direction , and after the second reversal of the second cell they will move towards each other .",
    "exact calculation shows that these two cells will never jam again in the absence of other cells . instead , exactly at the moment when these two cells touch each other",
    ", the first cell will reverse for a third time and they will move in the same direction again",
    ". this pattern of periodic motion without jamming of these two cells will continue for arbitrary long time ( or until another , third cell , would approach them close enough to jam with one of these two cells ) .",
    "it means that any two isolated cells jam only once and after that both cells will experience periodic motion without disturbing one another .",
    "a similar interaction pattern occurs if we consider a system of three or more cells moving in an infinite spatial domain .",
    "after several collisions ( jams ) between these three or more cells , they will also end up in the state where they will not jam any more and all cells will experience periodic motion without touching each other . a center of mass of each cell participating in a jam shifts relative to its average position at a distance @xmath77 to the left or to the right ( depending on which side it has a jam ) , where @xmath74 is the collision time .",
    "however , after all collisions are over , center of mass of each cell experiences periodic motion and no average motion ( averaged over the period @xmath9 ) is observed .",
    "we refer to such state as an equilibrium motion of myxobacteria .",
    "note that equilibrium motion is quite different from the equilibrium distribution ( gibbs distribution ) in statistical mechanics @xcite because myxobacteria are always self - propelled and are not subject to any type of thermal equilibrium . starting with a finite number of initially densely packed myxobacteria ,",
    "after finite number of collisions and provided myxobacteria divisions are neglected , the bacterial colony expands to such size that there will be no more collisions between cells .",
    "after that the average size of the colony remains the same with bacteria moving periodically at equilibrium .",
    "we now calculate the density of myxobacteria @xmath0 at which a transition occurs from motion with collisions to equilibrium motion .",
    "first , consider two neighboring cells and assume that they have phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "generally @xmath80 but assuming periodicity over time @xmath9 we can always add a multiple of @xmath9 to each of the phases , @xmath81 , @xmath82 ( @xmath83 are integers ) , to keep the difference of modified phases inside a twice smaller interval : @xmath84 . for @xmath85 cells do not jam but during a part of the time interval @xmath9 they move together ( attaching to each other ) in the same direction until one of them reverses .",
    "after that , they move in opposite directions from each other for the time interval @xmath86 . after that second cell reverses and both cells",
    "move in the same direction etc .",
    "minimum separation between centers of mass of these two cells is @xmath15 and maximum separation is @xmath87 .",
    "so the distance @xmath88 between the average positions of centers of mass is @xmath89 .",
    "now , to calculate the average density @xmath0 of many cells we average @xmath88 over phase differences @xmath90 resulting in the critical density @xmath91^{-1}=\\frac{l}{l+vt/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the standard values @xmath92 it yields that @xmath93    if initially there is a localized distribution of cells with the average density @xmath1 , then these cells will spread out with collisions until their density reaches @xmath94 if initially @xmath95 , then some redistribution of cellular density may occur when the average distance between centers of mass of two neighboring cell is @xmath96 .",
    "because average density is low , this would result only in a local redistribution of the positions of cells without much change in the macroscopic cellular density .",
    "after initial spreading out no collisions or cellular density transport will be observed .",
    "we conclude that in order to observe transport of a system of self - propelled rods without noise in the reversal period @xmath10 at long times one needs to incorporate in the model a source of the density gradient . in myxobacteria swarms ,",
    "such a source is present because of division of cells in the center of the bacterial colony .",
    "thus any transport of self - propelled rods without noise in @xmath10 is a collective phenomena with the threshold density @xmath0 required for transport .",
    "we now take into account the noise of the reversal period @xmath10 in the analysis of the previous section . in that case collisions between cells",
    "occurs even for @xmath95 because random walk of the average position of cells causes them to move at arbitrary large distance until finally colliding with other cells .",
    "when density approaches to zero the frequency of collisions also goes to zero .",
    "but if @xmath97 from below then cells collide typically at each period @xmath9 with the collision time @xmath98 ( so that for @xmath99 that collision time would vanish ) .",
    "thus @xmath0 separates two regime of collisions : for @xmath95 rare collisions primary occur because of the noise of @xmath10 while for @xmath1 collisions are dominated by frequent collisions . at the transition densities @xmath100 the contributions of both of these effects are comparable .",
    "thus a transport of myxobacteria is a mixture of two effects .",
    "first effect is the diffusion of individual cells due to the noise in the reversal period @xmath10 which dominates for small densities @xmath95 .",
    "second effect is due to the frequent collision of cells during each period @xmath9 making that effect essentially collective one .",
    "these two regimes make myxobacteria quite distinct from bacteria like _ e. coli _ or amoeba _ dictyostelium discoideum _ which experience diffusion as random walk of brownian - like particles @xcite without any periodic motion .",
    "if the cellular density @xmath48 is not small ( @xmath1 ) so that cells typically experience collisions during each period @xmath9 , then cell motion is more complicated than described in section [ section : elementarycollisions ] which is based on rare pairwise collisions .",
    "in addition we assume here and below that there is nonzero noise in @xmath10 as in section [ section : reintroductionofnoise ] .",
    "figures [ jam](a - d ) show pairwise jam time ( jam duration ) versus collision number that occur between three adjacent cells for the average cellular density @xmath101 . in that case",
    "cells occupy 95% of total volume and between two reversals each cell can cover up to @xmath47 cell volumes meaning that it could collide with multiple cells if allowed to .",
    "it is shown in figure [ jam ] that distribution of pairwise jam time @xmath74 is random .",
    "such regime typically occurs closer to the bacterial colony center where cell flux caused by cell divisions is large and it keeps the system far from equilibrium motion state as described in section [ section : elementarycollisions ] .",
    "+    there are at least two situations where such a far from equilibrium state is possible .",
    "first is the high density gradient case caused by bacterial division ( as mentioned above ) .",
    "the second case occurs if no - flux boundary conditions maintain a large density of myxobacteria in a domain with fixed volume . in both cases",
    "the rate of bacterial jamming is high and the collision times are randomly distributed .",
    "another effect which occurs in case of large densities is the high probability of formation of clusters consisting of more than two bacteria .",

    "assume that the process we are studying can be modeled using the nonlinear diffusion equation ( [ nonlineardiffusion1 ] ) with some unknown nonlinear diffusion coefficient @xmath14 .",
    "bm analysis allow to recover @xmath14 from the 1d dynamics of the cellular density @xmath48 with the stepwise initial condition @xmath214 at infinite 1d domain . here",
    "we assume that @xmath215 .",
    "special property of the stepwise initial condition is that it does not have any spatial scale ( spatial size of system is infinite and spatial scale of jump at @xmath216 is zero . then the only possible solution has a self - similar form @xmath217 which was found by boltzmann in 1894 . here",
    "@xmath218 which is motivated by a self - similar solution of a heat equation ( for @xmath219 ) .",
    "@xmath220 is a reference point also known as the matanos interface . assuming that @xmath221 does not depend on @xmath57 explicitly",
    ", we obtain that @xmath222 and @xmath223 which allows to reduce ( [ nonlineardiffusion1 ] ) to @xmath224.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the solutions to a non - linear diffusion equation with stepwise initial conditions are monotonic , it follows that for any given fixed time the function @xmath12 is invertible with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "below we use the notation @xmath225 for the inverse of @xmath12 . integrating both sides of ( [ zetaeqn ] ) with respect to @xmath226 yields @xmath227 where the left hand side follows from @xmath228 since @xmath229 ,",
    "the equation can be rewritten as @xmath230^{-1}\\int_{p_l } ^{p } ( x(p)-x_m ) dp,\\ ] ] which gives the boltzmann description of the diffusion equation .",
    "now it is possible to calculate the appropriate value of the interface , @xmath220 , to ensure that the diffusion calculation is consistent .",
    "specifically , since mass diffuses from the left to the right across the interface , there is a mass conservation equation where the mass lost on the left of the interface should equal the mass gained on the right of the interface , @xmath231 again inverting @xmath12 , we can calculate the area under of the integrals in terms of @xmath225 to get the following equivalent expression @xmath232 which simplifies to @xmath233 mass conservation occurs precisely when @xmath234 which is the matano s result to determine @xmath220 if it is unknown in advance .    in our simulations",
    "we know @xmath220 in advance so in fact we use boltzmann analysis , but not bm analysis ( except additional tests discussed in appendix b ) . also in our simulations @xmath235 and @xmath236",
    "+    bm analysis , described in appendix a , is defined on infinite spatial interval with step - wise initial conditions only .",
    "assume now that we apply bm analysis for top - hat initial conditions as described in section [ section : microscopicstochasticmodelcellmotion ] .",
    "in that case bm analysis is only approximate one because initial conditions include spatial scale @xmath237 , which is the spatial width of top - hat .",
    "self - similar solution of appendix a does not agree with top - hat .",
    "that solution is only approximately valid in the neighborhood of each of two steps of top - hat . because of spatial symmetry it is enough to consider any of these two steps . to estimate the accuracy of bm analysis in that case we note that if the density at @xmath63 ( middle of top - hat ) remains nearly constant then bm analysis is still applicable ( except small unavoidable corrections because for any @xmath238 density is never exactly constant ) . assuming that the diffusion coefficient @xmath239 , we roughly estimate that the width of initial top - hat doubles with time when @xmath240 which gives @xmath241 for @xmath242 . for @xmath243",
    "a change of density in the middle of top - hat is small in agreement with figure [ diffusioncurves ] .",
    "a similar limitation of bm analysis is that the total spatial width of the simulation domain must exceed the width of top - hat in several times to make sure that the cellular density remains low at boundaries as seen in figure [ diffusioncurves ] .    as additional test of bm analysis we varied the domain length and width of the initial top - hat distribution calculating diffusion coefficient by bm analysis from msm simulations ( figure [ bmtests]a ) .",
    "we observed that small top - hat width @xmath244 is not enough for applicability of bm analysis(dash - dotted curve in figure [ bmtests]a ) while top - hat widths @xmath245 total domain lengths @xmath246 are far enough for such applicability .",
    "figure [ bmtests]b compares @xmath14 obtained from pde simulation ( solid line ) and msm simulations ( dashed line ) for top - hat initial conditions of width @xmath247 .",
    "difference between these curves is almost indistinguishable .",
    "this indicates that our statistical ensemble in msm simulations is large enough to avoid influence of noise in the data on the diffusion curve .",
    "we also tested msm data with and without the gaussian filter and obtained the same diffusion curves .",
    "larger widths were also tested and proven to match very well , but the results are not displayed here . from these observations , we can conclude that the generated diffusion curves are independent of the width of the top hat used if the top hat is sufficiently long enough in such a way that the center and boundaries have constant density .",
    "we would like to point out to avoid confusion that we need bm analysis only to determine the diffusion curves at reasonably small times ( @xmath248 ) .",
    "after that we run pde simulations with these diffusion curves for much longer time ( when density is changing both at the middle of top - hat and at boundaries ) . for these much larger times",
    "we also see very good agreement between msm simulations and pde simulations ( see e.g. figures [ 8reversalperiod ] and [ pdedensityreversals ] ) .    as discussed in section [ section : macroscopicnonlineardiffusionmodelvsmsmsimulations ] , another limitation of bm analysis is the loss of numerical precision near @xmath249 because bm analysis requires calculating @xmath112 . many figures ( [ diffusioncurves ] and [ bmtests ] ) have jumps of @xmath14 near @xmath114 which is due to such loss of numerical precision which can be fixed by the polynomial extrapolation .",
    "that is however not necessary because these jumps do not change results of pde simulations in any significant way .",
    "we also tested bm analysis vs. boltzmann analysis as shown in figure [ bmtests]c . although we know @xmath220 from top - hat initial conditions , but for finite width of top - hat we can ask if allowing @xmath220 to be located not exactly at the step of top - hat could improve the accuracy of bm analysis to determine @xmath250 in that sense we can consider @xmath220 as additional fitting parameter to accomodate finiteness of top - had width . figure [ bmtests]c compares diffusion curves obtained from bm and boltzmann analysis vs. exact diffusion curve .",
    "we see that difference in accuracy between bm and boltzmann analysis is very small .",
    "it appears the advantage of using bm analysis vs. bolztmann analysis is not significant in our case .",
