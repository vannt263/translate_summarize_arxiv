    "in classical communication systems , information is usually encoded into orthogonal quantum or semi - classical states of light .",
    "an important example is binary phase shift keying with coherent states where the logical information , `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , is encoded as two coherent states with large amplitudes and a relative phase of @xmath0 . since the two coherent states each possess a large amplitude ( with opposite signs ) ,",
    "they are nearly orthogonal and thus they can be easily discriminated using an interferometric measurement strategy . on the other hand ,",
    "if the amplitude becomes very small , which is the case for quantum communication as well as long distance amplification - free ( e.g. free - space ) classical communication , the two states are largely overlapping and thus non - orthognal . due to this non - orthogonality , the states can no longer be perfectly discriminated .",
    "although perfect discrimination is not possible , it is of high interest to find optimized strategies in order to minimize measurement errors , thus keeping the error rate as low as possible and increasing the mutual information between sender and receiver .",
    "moreover , the search for such optimised strategies are of utmost importance for many applications in quantum communication with quantum key distribution ( qkd ) being the prime example  @xcite . finally , we note that the problem of finding optimised measurement schemes associted with pre - defined alphabet is a fundamental problem in quantum mechnics  @xcite .",
    "there are basically two well - known discrimination strategies . in the first strategy ,",
    "all measurement outcomes are used ( that is , it is deterministic ) and , therefore , the resulting conclusions will be infected by errors . the idea is to optimise the strategy such that the probability for making an error is minimized .",
    "this strategy is known as minimum error state discrimination and has been analyzed by helstrom  @xcite .",
    "the second discrimination strategy is probabilistic , and yields only a valid outcome when the conclusion drawn from the measurement is known to be error - free .",
    "therefore , in this task the goal is to minimise the probability of inconclusive results ( which are discarded ) .",
    "this strategy is known as unambiguous state discrimination ( usd ) and was originally proposed by ivanovic , dieks and peres  @xcite .",
    "a combination of the two discrimination schemes where one allows for both erroneous and inconclusive results has also been treated theoretically .",
    "more precisely , the minimal probability of errors for a fixed probability of inconclusive results has been derived for pure and mixed states in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .    for the discrimination of two coherent states with minimum error , several optimal and near - optimal receivers",
    "have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "also , a device for implementing usd of coherent states was proposed by huttner  @xcite and later by banaszek  @xcite .",
    "some of these schemes have been experimentally accessed , such as the dolinar receiver  @xcite , the optimized displacement receiver  @xcite and a programmable receiver implementing usd  @xcite .",
    "however , the intermediate regime where errors as well as inconclusive results may occur has only recently been investigated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we elaborate on the work of ref  @xcite .",
    "we investigate two different receivers that belong to the intermediate regime .",
    "the first receiver is a standard homodyne detector , and the second receiver is a displacement controlled photon number resolving detector  @xcite . in both receivers the measurement outcomes are postselected to obtain a specific relation between errors and inconclusive results .",
    "the postselection based homodyne detector has been used in various protocols such as qkd  @xcite , squeezed state and entangled state distillation  @xcite and quantum state engineering@xcite . here",
    "we thoroughly characterize the detector in terms of the discrimination between two coherent states .",
    "in addition we conduct a thorough experimental analysis of the displacement based photon number resolving detector which was introduced in ref  @xcite .",
    "we find that the displacement based pnr receiver outperforms the standard homodyne detection .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we recapitulate the notion of intermediate measurement for coherent states in section  [ measurement ] . in section  [ hd ] and",
    "section  [ pnr ] , we consider measurements in the intermediate regime with two strategies : a receiver using a homodyne detection and a receiver using an optimized displacement combined with a photon number resolving detector . in section  [ hd ]",
    ", we also prove that the post - selection based homodyne scheme is the optimal strategy for realizing the intermediate measurement within all possible gaussian operations and conditional dynamics .",
    "we demonstrate experimentally both receivers in section  [ exp ] .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in section  [ comp ] .",
    "let us assume a sender picks one signal state out of two pure and phase shifted coherent states and sends it through a communication channel that preserves the quantum property of the state . on the other end of the channel , a receiver has to tell which state was chosen by the sender . let us also assume that the _ a priori _ probabilities for the preparation of the states are @xmath1 and that the received states are @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the receiver measures the signal state and based on the measurement outcome guesses the state . due to the non - orthogonality of the alphabet ,",
    "however , the result will not be correct in all such attempts .",
    "in fact , the minimal error probability is given by the inner product of the states in the alphabet , @xmath4 .",
    "the maximally accessible information of the receiver is directly related to the minimal error rate .",
    "the receiver can alternatively choose a measurement strategy which allows for inconclusive results .",
    "in this strategy , he will only accept states that are likely to be correctly identified , while he does not attempt to guess the results for signals associated with the inconclusive measurement results .",
    "this strategy is probabilistic as the outcomes are post selected .",
    "it can be shown , that for higher probability of inconclusive results @xmath5 ( or lower acceptance probability @xmath6 ) a lower error probability @xmath7 can be achieved .",
    "this intermediate measurement strategy can be described by the three - component positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , an inconclusive result will occur with the probability @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) represents the probability of inconclusive results when @xmath2 @xmath14 was prepared .",
    "furthermore , the average error probability is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) represents the error probability of mistakenly guessing @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "finally the measurement strategy is optimized , such that the receiver s error probability is minimized for a given probability of inconclusive results . the error probability according to  @xcite is then given by @xmath20 where the error rate is lower bounded by the inner product and the tolerated rate of inconclusive results .",
    "a receiver scheme achieving this optimal bound is yet unknown .",

    "furthermore , in the follwing we prove that any conditional operation will not improve the discrimination task . to prove this , we consider two different gaussian operators .",
    "the first operation is a partial measurement of the signal which in general outputs a measurement outcome ( classical number ) and a conditioned output state . for an input of @xmath90 , the conditioned output",
    "is given as @xmath91 where @xmath92 are general multi - mode states that preserve gaussian statistics with the joint covariance matrix @xmath93 and the displacement @xmath94 . here",

    "moreover , it was shown that @xmath95 can be always transformed into another mixture of coherent states @xcite , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is some gaussian state and @xmath98 with real and positive @xmath99 .",
    "such an additional gaussian operation can be deterministic and independent of the partial measurement outcome @xmath100 . since only the posteriori probabilities depend on @xmath100 , the optimal second operation is independent of @xmath60 and given by a fixed homodyne measurement ( @xmath101 ) as already shown .",
    "we therefore conclude that any conditional dynamics is not useful in the two - step measurement scenario .",
    "an extension of the above conclusion to the multi - step measurement scenario is straightforward , which proves the optimality of the homodyne detector within all possible gaussian operations and conditional dynamics .",
    "quadrature measurements ( measurements of the light s field amplitude ) and photon counting measurements ( measurements of the excitation of a light field ) are fundamentally different .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to investigate also a receiver based on the latter technique . in ref .  @xcite we proposed to use a photon number resolving ( pnr ) receiver for the discrimination of two coherent states .",
    "it consists of two stages : a displacement operation @xmath102 and a photon number resolving detector ( pnrd ) , and it is sketched in fig .  [ schemes](c ) .",
    "the post selection process of the pnr receiver is similar to the one of the homodyne detector : if the measurement outcome of the pnr detector is @xmath103 , we guess @xmath2 , if it is @xmath104 ( where @xmath105 is the threshold parameter ) , we guess @xmath18 and otherwise the measurment is inconclusive .",

    "the linearly polarized beam is split asymmetrically in two parts to serve as a local oscillator of the homodyne receiver ( lo ) and an auxiliary oscillator ( ao ) for state preparation and displacement in the pnr receiver scheme .",
    "the signal state ( s ) is generated in a polarisation mode orthogonal to the auxiliary mode using an electro - optical modulator : the field amplitude of the auxiliary mode is coherently transfered into the signal polarisation and the excitation is controlled by the input voltage of the modulator .",
    "note that the auxiliary oscillator remains in the polarisation mode orthogonal to the signal mode thus propagating along with the signal .",
    "after splitting the signal on a 50/50 beam splitter , two identical signal states ( either @xmath126 or @xmath127 ) are produced and subsequently directed to the two detection schemes .",
    "the signal states are generated in time windows of @xmath128 with a repetition rate of @xmath129 .",
    "this was done by applying a constant voltage across the modulator during the measurement time .",
    "the birefringence induced by the eom s input voltage causes a variable coupling between the s and ao mode similar to a variable beam splitter .",
    "we can therefore tune the signal amplitude continuously .",
    "this modulation scheme is in contrast to the commonly used sideband modulation approach in experiments with homodyne detectors , where a rf modulation is applied to the modulator to create a pair of frequency sideband modes which defines the quantum state .",
    "since the apd is not capable of selecting a specific pair of sideband modes , such a sideband approach can not be used when the homodyne detector is used in conjunction with an apd .",
    "the quantum states are therefore defined as a pulse in the temporal frame of the local oscillator .",
    "the exact pulses measured by the two detectors are not identical as they have different frequency response .",
    "the effect of the detector response is described after the detailed description of the detection schemes .",
    "we carefully characterise the prepared input signal and verify that the excess noise added to the quadrature by the signal preparation is only @xmath130 shot noise units ( see ref .",
    "such has purity is achieved by attenuation of the laser ( the carrier ) down to the single photon level thereby minimizing the thermal fluctuations at low frequencies prevailing the diode laser .    at the homodyne receiver",
    "the signal interferes with the local oscillator , the two resulting outputs are detected and the difference current is produced .",

    "these data was then averaged and thus resulting in a single quadrature measurement for a 800ns pulse .",
    "the technical noise at low frequencies was removed by correcting for the base line shift occurring between consecutive signal states .",
    "the phase of the signal relative to the lo is estimated by sending a number of bright calibration pulses along with the signal pulses .",
    "subsequently , the measurements are accepted or discarded according to the estimated phase , i.e. they are only accepted if the measurement was performed along the signal encoding quadrature .",
    "this substitutes a technically demanding phase locking method .",
    "a drawback is the increasing measurement time .",
    "the overall quantum efficiency of the homodyne receiver amounts to @xmath131 ; the interference contrast to the local oscillator is @xmath132 and the pin - diode quantum efficiency is @xmath133 .",
    "the electronic noise level is more than @xmath134 below the shot noise level .",

    ", the apd works as a primitive photon number resolving detector , as used in  @xcite .",
    "the quantum states are subsequently categorized according to the respective result of the photon number measurement , thus implementing the povms @xmath108 , @xmath106 and @xmath109 .",

    "[ schemes](b ) where two spatially separated modes interfere on a beam splitter , in our setup the two modes ( the auxiliary and the signal modes ) are in the same spatial mode but have different polarisation modes ( fig .",
    "[ schemes](c ) ) . the interference ( and thus the displacement )",
    "is therefore controlled by a modulator and a polarizing beam splitter .",
    "this method facilitates the displacement operation and yields a very high interference contrast of 99.6% .",
    "a high extinction ratio is of high importance as the mis - matched part of the auxiliary might impinge onto the apd and cause false detection events .",
    "such false counts can be detrimental to the discrimination task for receivers with low error rate and especially if the signal amplitude is relatively large .",

    "the efficiency can reach nearly 100% , and the beam splitter mode matching efficiencies beyond 99% have been reported .",
    "the efficiency of the pnr is mainly limited by the quality of the displacement operation and the efficiency of the avalanche photo diode ( apd ) . for higher values of m",
    ", we also find that also the probability of false detection events becomes important ( see @xmath166 in fig .",
    "[ comprates](a ) ) .",
    "we used a commercial available apd , but the development of photon number resolving detectors with very high quantum efficiency is rapidly progressing(see  @xcite for a detailed list ) .",
    "in this paper we have thoroughly investigated two different probabilistic receivers of binary - encoded optical coherent states ; the homodyne detector and the displacement controlled photon number resolving detector .",
    "these receivers yield inconclusive as well as error affected results and we have carefully conducted a detailed study of the relation between these two outcomes .",
    "furthermore , we found , theoretically , that the homodyne detector is the optimal gaussian receiver for minimizing the errors for a fixed probability of inconclusive results .",
    "experimentally , we have implemented both receivers and through comparison we found that the performance of the new displacement controlled pnr is better than the homodyne receiver .",
    "the new receiver is thus a promising alternative to the commonly used homodyne receiver .",
    "we find several advantages of the new scheme .",
    "for example , the power of the displacement beam is normally much lower than the power of the local oscillator beam required for homodyne detection , and thus less power is injected into the communication channel ( e.g. an optical fibre ) .",
    "this has the obvious benefit of lowering the power consumption in the fibre but it also lowers the risk of scattering of auiliary photons into the signal state as such scattering mechanism is proportional to the power .",
    "we also note that instead of performing the displacement operation at receiving station , it can be already implemented at the sending station .",
    "this would completely remove the necessity of a phase reference .",
    "finally , we note that the quadrature measurement can be also performed using a displacement operation followed by a single intensity detector similar to the setup of the pnr detector",
    ". however , in the former case the displacement must be macroscopic such that the quadratures are measured instead of the photon properties .",
    "the new receiver is fundamentally different from the more commonly used and technically mature homodyne detector . whether the pnr detector will be the future choice in real life implementations of binary detectors",
    "will depend on the future technical progress of the pnr detector technology .",
    "a future option is also to use both detector schemes in a receiving station , where the proper detection scheme is chosen according to the currently needed property , such as speed , low noise and the capability of performing a full tomography of the state  @xcite ."
