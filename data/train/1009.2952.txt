    "in this paper we consider the gibbsian properties of homogeneous low - temperature ising gibbs measures on trees , subjected to an infinite - temperature glauber evolution .",
    "this problem has been considered before on regular lattices see e.g. @xcite , for ising spins , @xmath0-vector and unbounded spins , and for various finite- or infinite - temperature dynamics , of glauber , kawasaki , or diffusion type , and even for non - markovian evolutions .    at high initial temperatures , or for suffiently short times , standard methods can be used to prove gibbsianness , also in our situation .",
    "thus the interesting case is to find out what happens for low initial temperatures .",
    "as usual ( but see the mean - field analysis of @xcite ) low - temperature dynamics are beyond reach so far . for simplicity we will consider infinite - temperature dynamics , but high - temperature evolutions are expected to behave qualitatively similarly .",
    "in contrast to what happens on regular lattices such as @xmath1 , the gibbsian properties of evolved gibbs measures for models on trees turn out to depend on which of the different gibbs measures ( plus or minus , versus intermediate ) one considers . in all cases there are two transition times : for the intermediate measure after the first transition time it becomes non - gibbsian in the familiar sense that some , but not all , configurations are `` bad '' ( that is , they are points of discontinuity ) , while it turns out that after a certain later time the evolved intermediate gibbs measure becomes `` totally bad '' ; thereafter it has the surprising property that _ all _ spin configurations are discontinuity points .",
    "this last property is something which will not happen for the other two extremal invariant gibbs measures . for those measures , although after a first transition time they also become non - gibbsian , after the second transition time they become gibbsian again",
    ".    we will provide proofs for these results on the cayley tree , and do nt aim for the greatest generality here , but we will indicate why these results should be expected to hold more generally .",
    "we present our results both in zero and non - zero external fields .",
    "our analysis illustrates ( again ) how different models on trees are as compared to models on regular ( amenable ) lattices .",
    "non - gibbsian properties of some other measures of statistical mechanical origin on trees have been considered before , @xcite . for fk measures as well as fuzzy potts models on trees , the possibility of having a positive - measure set of `` bad '' discontinuity points was found , and for a particular renormalised ising measure the set of bad points was shown to have measure zero , while having a fractal dimension .",

    "we require that for all volumes @xmath15 and configurations @xmath26 @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28 the infinite - volume gibbs measures are parametrized by the external magnetic fields ( in most of what follows we will consider a homogeneous field @xmath29 ) , and by the inverse temperature @xmath30 .",
    "this will lead us to consider finite - volume gibbs measures with this same homogeneous field plus a possibly different boundary field .",

    "these phases are extremal in the set of invariant infinite - volume gibbs measures ; @xmath40 and @xmath38 are also extremal in the set of all infinite - volume gibbs measures , whereas @xmath39 becomes non - extremal in this set below a certain temperature strictly smaller than the phase transition temperature @xcite ; however , this second transition will not concern us here .",
    "let @xmath41 be the cayley tree with @xmath0 generations and @xmath42 the ( sub- ) cayley tree with @xmath43 generations , where @xmath44 stands for the inner boundary of @xmath41 .",
    "it is a known result for the ising model on trees that the marginal on @xmath45 of the finite - volume gibbs measure on @xmath41 is a finite - volume gibbs measure on @xmath45 , with a possibly different external magnetic field at the boundary .",
    "see appendix for how this works out in marginalizing infinite - volume gibbs measures by using boundary laws .",
    "marginalizing on @xmath45 , that is to a tree of one generation less , leaves us with a finite - volume gibbs measure on @xmath45 , parametrized by the following external fields @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "thus , summarising , taking the marginal of an ising model gibbs measure on a tree with @xmath0 generations with homogeneous boundary field @xmath48 results in an ising model on an @xmath49-generation tree with a homogeneous boundary field @xmath50 .",

    "these three fixed points determine the three homogeneous extremal invariant infinite - tree gibbs measures mentioned above .",

    "this immediately guarantees the non - nullness of the measure @xmath69 for all @xmath70 ( including @xmath71 ) .",
    "it will thus suffice to study whether the transformed measure is quasi - local or not .",
    "define @xmath72 to be a realization of the corresponding conditional expectation for bounded @xmath73 , finite @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath76 when we condition only on configurations on a finite subset of sites @xmath77 . with this notation",
    "we have e.g@xmath78 , for volumes @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes integration over the variables outside of @xmath81 .    the measure @xmath82 is not quasilocal , if it is not consistent with any quasilocal specification . to prove this , it is enough to find a single , nonremovable , point of discontinuity ( in the product topology ) for a single @xmath83 for a single ( quasi)local function @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the definition of the non - quasilocality for the transformed measure can be refined , see in particular @xcite .",
    "the relevant definitions read as follows :    the measure @xmath82 is not quasilocal at @xmath84 if there exists @xmath85 and @xmath73 local ( given that @xmath86 is finite it suffices to look for @xmath73 local , with support @xmath87 ) such that no realization of @xmath88 is quasilocal at @xmath89 .",
    "in other words , any realization of @xmath88 must exhibit an essential discontinuity at @xmath89 ; one that survives zero - measure modifications .",
    "( remember that conditional probabilities are only defined up to measure - zero sets . )    for a local function @xmath73 as above , @xmath90 is @xmath82-essentially discontinuous at @xmath89 , if there exists an @xmath91 such that @xmath92    if @xmath90 is @xmath82-essentially discontinuous at @xmath89 , informally it means that there exists an @xmath91 such that for every @xmath12 there exists @xmath93 and configurations @xmath94 , such that @xmath95 for @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is of positive @xmath82-measure .",
    "@xmath90 is strongly discontinuous at @xmath89 , iff there exists an @xmath91 such that @xmath98    intuitively the difference is that whereas for @xmath82-essential discontinuity one needs to estimate a difference on two measurable sets of positive measure , for a strong discontinuity one needs an estimate of a difference on open sets ; however , because of the impossibility of conditioning on individual configurations , we get the somewhat unwieldy definitions above .    a useful tool to study whether @xmath82 stays gibbs is to consider the joint two - time distribution @xmath99 on @xmath100 , where the initial spins @xmath8 are distributed according to @xmath27 , and the evolved spins @xmath101 according to @xmath82 .",
    "this joint distribution will be denoted by either @xmath99 or @xmath102 .",
    "it can be viewed as a gibbs measure on @xmath103 with @xmath104 consisting of two `` layers '' of @xmath2 .",
    "formally , the hamiltonian of @xmath102 is @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the transition kernel of the dynamics .",
    "we consider independent spin - flip dynamics , so    @xmath107    let us denote @xmath108 this approach to study the evolved measure as the marginal of a two - layer gibbs measure was introduced in @xcite , and has been applied repeatedly since .    here",
    "we will find for @xmath109 , by making the choices @xmath110 , + @xmath111 , that in any open neighborhood of @xmath89 two positive - measure sets exist , on which the limits differ , however , in contrast to amenable graphs , these sets are not open ( which allows different behaviour between different evolved gibbs measures @xmath39 and @xmath40 as regards their gibbsianness , something which is excluded on amenable graphs such as @xmath1 ) . in other words we will show a @xmath82-essential , although non - strong , discontinuity .    as explained in the appendix",
    "we have the representation of the conditional probabilities of the time - evolved measure @xmath112 of the form @xmath113(d\\s_0)p_t ( \\s_0,\\eta_0 ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] with the perturbed @xmath101-dependent measure on spin configurations + @xmath114(d\\s)\\equiv\\mu[\\eta_{\\l\\ba 0},\\eta_0=0](d\\s)$ ] whose finite - volume marginals look like @xmath115(\\s_{\\l'})=c   \\exp \\left\\ { \\b \\sum_{(i , j)\\in \\l'}\\s_i\\s_j + \\sum_{i\\in \\l'\\setminus \\del\\l ' } h_i",

    "this value represents the fixed point of the recursion relation with homogeneous field @xmath29 , , and is bijectively related with the starting measure @xmath64 .",
    "more generally , such a representation is always valid if the initial measure is a markov chain on the tree .",
    "markov chains can be described by boundary laws , and conditional probabilities of infinite - temperature time evolutions , are , for finite - volume conditionings , described by boundary laws obeying recursions which are local perturbations of those of the initial measure , see the appendix and @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we choose @xmath118 and @xmath119 . with this notation , for non - gibbsianness",
    "it is enough to prove that , at @xmath89 , there exists an @xmath120 such that , for all @xmath15 there exists @xmath79 such that @xmath121(\\s_0 ) -\\mu[\\bar\\eta_{\\l\\setminus0},\\xi^2_{\\l'\\setminus\\l}](\\s_0 )          \\right|>\\e\\ ] ]      to prove the non - gibbsianness of @xmath82 , we will have to consider the phase transition behaviour of the gibbs measures on the first layer in various external fields .",
    "these external fields are determined by the various conditionings , as well as by the choice of the initial gibbs measure .",

    "it can be shown that taking the marginal on @xmath130 of the finite - volume gibbs measure on @xmath127 ( summing out the spin @xmath131 ) gives us a finite - volume gibbs measure on @xmath130 with an external field at the boundary equal to @xmath132 here the sum is over the nearest neighbors @xmath133 .",
    "the equation tells us how the configurations @xmath134 will affect the field acting on @xmath135 after having taken one - generation marginal .",
    "the configuration @xmath136 will govern the value of the fields at @xmath137 , when the marginal on @xmath138 is taken .",
    "let us see how :    * @xmath139 @xmath140 * @xmath141 @xmath142    note that the above chosen @xmath101-conditioning on the annulus makes the recursion homogeneous .",
    "choosing @xmath143 big enough guarantees that the recursions , approach their time - dependent fixed points ; we denote them respectively by @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , @xmath147 , see figure .",

    "@xmath151 represents the biggest stable fixed point for the @xmath152 recursion , and @xmath153 the smallest stable fixed point for the @xmath154 recursion .",
    "the fact that both recursions have as a starting point the unstable fixed point @xmath155 guarantees that the plus conditioning will drag the field towards @xmath151 and the minus one towards @xmath153 .",

    "assuming the validity of the last formula for the finite - volume marginals one arrives at a @xmath407-dependent consistency ( or recursion ) relation that a boundary law has to satisfy .",

    "note that is a one - sided recursion which has no beginning and no end .",
    "it is interesting in the first step to look at homogeneous solutions , i.e. solutions not depending on the bond @xmath394 , but there may be also many other solutions , even in the case when the local magnetic field in the initial hamiltonian is site - independent . in that case",
    "there can be non - homogeneous solutions when there are more than one fixed points for the homogeneous recursion .",
    "indeed , to construct a non - homogeneous solution one picks a site @xmath170 and looks to all oriented bonds @xmath394 pointing to it , and picks values of @xmath409 not at the fixed point .",

    "the value has to be chosen such that it lies between a stable and an unstable fixed point .    to see the meaning of the boundary law in a more intuitive or physical way",
    "let us make explicit the difference to the field which is already present in the original hamiltonian .",
