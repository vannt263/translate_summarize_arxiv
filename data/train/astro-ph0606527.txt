    "dynamical mass estimates of high redshift galaxies are now starting to play a significant role in our developing understanding of galaxy assembly in the early universe , a trend that will likely become even more important in the near future . directly measuring the dynamical masses from the spatially - resolved spectra of high - redshift galaxies",
    "is observationally very challenging , but dynamical masses are less prone to degeneracies and evolutionary bias than mass estimates based solely on photometry .",
    "fascinatingly , they may also allow us to directly probe the baryonic and dark matter content and concentration of galaxies in the early universe , and to measure their angular momenta @xcite .",
    "ultimately , they will enable us , for example , to directly compare the growth of galaxy mass and angular momentum with model predictions as a function of redshift .",
    "accurately measuring the kinematics of high - redshift galaxies is therefore a major step forward .    to realize these goals , we must show convincingly that the kinematics we measure in a high redshift galaxy have a simple proportionality to the mass distribution and rule out that they are dominated by the orbit or angular momentum loss of mergers or by hydrodynamical processes like , e.g. , starburst - driven `` superwinds '' @xcite .",
    "the lyman - break technique has led to the largest sample of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies from z@xmath92.7 to 6.4 . despite our rapidly growing understanding of their ensemble properties , such as their luminosity function , clustering , and star - formation history ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our knowledge of their detailed intrinsic properties remains rather rudimentary .",
    "lbgs at z@xmath93 have typical radii of @xmath18 @xcite so that the spatially resolved kinematics are often difficult to obtain .",
    "thus , dynamical mass estimates for individual lbgs at z@xmath93 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are based mostly on line widths and only in a handful of cases have velocity gradients been observed .",
    "spatially resolved lbgs are large compared to the overall population , and might be biased towards the strongest line emitting galaxies ( e.g. , vigorous starbursts ) or early - stage mergers and perhaps are not representative for the overall population .    the only way to properly address these issues is to resolve the dynamics of an lbg on fine scale .",
    "strongly gravitationally lensed lbgs are a promising way to probe small physical scales even with seeing - limited data",
    ". the ideal target would be a strongly - lensed , highly inclined lbg , where the kinematic major axis is roughly along a caustic . such a configuration would allow several patches of the same galaxy , but at different radii , to be highly magnified to include the intrinsically low surface - brightness periphery . probing non - lensed lbgs in this way",
    "is impossible given their generally small radii , faint magnitudes , and low surface brightnesses .",
    "unfortunately , strongly lensed lbgs with a favorable lensing geometry are exceedingly rare .",
    "two cases at z@xmath191 have been studied in detail so far , ms1512-cb58 at z=2.8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ac114-s2 at z=1.9 @xcite .",
    "however , the underlying dynamical mechanism is not conclusively revealed in either case .",
    "ms1512-cb58 is magnified by a factor @xmath20 , but it is compact and has no apparent velocity gradient @xcite  most likely because of an unfavourable lensing geometry . from the mm co emission line width ,",
    "@xcite measure @xmath21 , not corrected for inclination .",
    "ac114-s2 has a velocity gradient @xcite , but is a merger with complex morphology , and its nature is not well constrained . that spatially - resolved spectroscopy of giant arcs can provide valuable constraints on the internal dynamics of the lensed galaxies",
    "has recently been shown by @xcite for a sample of 6 giant arcs at lower redshift , z@xmath91 .",
    "@xcite found regular kinematics in 4 of the 6 galaxies , consistent with quiescently rotating disks , while in 2 galaxies , they observed complex line profiles of varying widths and irregular velocity structure suggestive of either mergers or outflows .    the strongly lensed z=3.24=0.7 and h@xmath22=70 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 , in which d@xmath24=27.9 gpc and d@xmath25=1.5 gpc at @xmath26 .",

    "`` arc@xmath1core '' galaxy behind the z=0.3 x - ray cluster 1e0657 - 56 @xcite appears to be different from these well - studied high - redshift gravitational arcs .",
    "its lensing configuration suggests the simultaneous magnification of a high surface brightness region at the south - eastern tip of the source that may be associated with the `` core '' of the galaxy as well as a more highly magnified , lower surface brightness region outside the core (  arc  ; * ? ? ?",
    "the total extent of the arc is @xmath914 , and it has a complex substructure : @xcite identify 3 faint knots of similar surface brightness within the arc , each separated by a few arcseconds .",
    "they propose that the central highest surface brightness region of the lensed galaxy , lying near , but outside the cusp - caustic , is seen as the bright core , whereas a fainter outer region on one side of the same galaxy , which touches the cusp - caustic and is split into three merging images , constitutes the full extent of the arc .",
    "thus the asymmetric magnified image comprising the near - nuclear region and peripheral patches originating on one side of the galaxy . the high magnification ( @xmath27 ) presents an excellent opportunity to investigate the properties of a z@xmath93 galaxy at different radii with high physical and spatial resolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after presenting observations and data reduction in  [ sec : obsred ] , we turn in ",
    "[ sec : acs ] to the rest - frame uv and optical properties , highlighting the high - resolution acs morphology .",
    "we discuss the spatially - resolved rest - frame emission line kinematics extracted from three  dimensional data cubes obtained with the integral - field spectrograph spiffi in ",

    "this includes a detailed discussion of the 146 km s@xmath23 velocity gradient in the core and its continuation in the arc . in ",

    "we summarize our results in  [ sec : summary ] and draw a likely evolutionary scenario for lbgs .",
    "given the interesting lensing configuration of the 1e0657 - 56 arc@xmath1core galaxy and the wealth of supplementary data , we observed it with the near - infrared integral field spectrograph spiffi @xcite , using ut2 of the vlt ( spiffi has since become part of the sinfoni instrument on ut4 ) .",
    "we obtained deep k band spectroscopy of 1e0657 - 56 arc core , covering the core and neighboring parts of the arc .",
    "observations in april 2003 were carried out under variable sky conditions , with a total integration time of 190 minutes .",
    "one `` off '' frame at a sky position was taken for each `` on '' frame in an off - on - on - off mode , with a spectral resolution of r @xmath28 at @xmath29 and using the scale of @xmath30 pixel@xmath23 .",
    "individual exposure times are 600s .",
    "data reduction was performed extending the package of the standard iraf @xcite tools for reducing longslit spectra .",
    "individual exposures were dark frame subtracted and flat - fielded using exposures of an internal calibration lamp .",
    "we identified bad pixels based on dark and flat - field frames , and replaced them by interpolations of the surrounding pixels ( in all 3 dimensions ) .",
    "rectification and wavelength calibration are done before night sky subtraction , to account for some spectral flexure between the frames .",
    "curvature in each individual slit - let of each frame was measured and removed using an arc lamp , before shifting the spectra to an absolute ( vacuum ) wavelength scale with reference to the oh lines in the data .    to account for variations in the night sky emission , we normalize the sky frame to the average of the object frame separately for each wavelength before sky subtraction , masking bright foreground objects , and correcting for residuals of the background subtraction and uncertainties in the flux calibration by subsequently subtracting the ( empty sky ) background separately from each wavelength plane .",
    "the three dimensional data cubes are then reconstructed , assuming that each slitlet covers exactly 32 pixels .",
    "they are spatially aligned by cross - correlating the collapsed cubes , and then combined , clipping deviant pixels .",
    "telluric correction is applied to the combined cube .",
    "flux scales are obtained from standard star observations . from the light profile of the standard star , we measure",
    "the fwhm spatial resolution to be @xmath31  in right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "data taking and reduction of the rest - frame uv spectroscopy of the arc and core with fors1 on the vlt was described by @xcite .",
    "they also kindly provided their r - band data for the present work , which has a total exposure time of 3800 s and seeing of @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite give a full account of how these data were obtained and reduced . c. forman - jones and collaborators have recently obtained high - resolution imaging of the cluster 1e0657 - 56 through the f814w filter using the acs camera onboard the hst .",
    "they kindly shared with us a protion of their full image containing the region around the arc@xmath1core before publication .",
    "the acs f814w image ( @xmath33  in the rest - frame ) shows the complex structure of this source in great detail ( fig .  [",
    "fig : acsimspifpos ] ) .",
    "irregular high surface - brightness patches , perhaps star - forming hii regions , are seen in the arc , embedded in a more continuous structure with much lower surface brightness .",
    "the core has an overall higher surface brightness , with a bright , unresolved spot in the center , and two extensions of lower surface brightness in an s - like shape .    the spatial resolution of the image ( obtained from the tinytim package ; * ?",
    "* ) is 0.09  in both right ascension and declination .",
    "the arc and core are both spatially resolved in the direction perpendicular to the magnification axis .",
    "deconvolved profile widths along the unlensed direction are 0.113  ( @xmath90.9 kpc ) for the brightest part of the core , and @xmath34  ( @xmath35 kpc ) in the arc . along the magnification axis , the central region of the core has a diameter of @xmath36 , about 4 times larger than the unlensed 0.113  diameter perpendicular to it.core galaxy lies near the einstein radius , so the exact profile shape does not have much of an impact on this estimate . ]",
    "the full size of the core along the direction of magnification is 1.3 .",
    "since the lensing direction is roughly along the vertical axis of the cube , and the spiffi data are not spatially resolved in the perpendicular direction , we simply extract spectra from each individual pixel row or slitlet which lie along this direction . the core is a bright [ oiii]5007 line emitter , with @xmath37 in each spectrum , and uniform dispersions of @xmath38 . fitting the centroids of the [ oiii]5007 emission line , we find an overall velocity gradient of 146  over a total physical distance of @xmath39 kpc for @xmath40 . extracting spectra from the 3 knots indicated by the boxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : lineim ] yields offsets relative to the core of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the latter value might be somewhat influenced by a night sky line residual . ) , because of the large uncertainties related to geometrical distortions of the @xmath8 gravitational lens .",
    "moreover , the lensing implies another correction factor @xmath44 , to account for the inclination between the kinematic major axis of the arc@xmath1core galaxy and the magnification axis . all relative velocities in this paper",
    "are therefore projected velocities , @xmath45 . ]",
    "we will therefore use the average of @xmath46 and @xmath47 to estimate the rotation velocity in the peripheral regions of the arc@xmath1core galaxy , @xmath48 .",
    "we show the velocity curve of the arc@xmath1core in fig .",
    "[ fig : velcurve ] .",
    "unfortunately , both the cluster potential and influence of nearby galaxies are not known accurately enough to allow for a robust magnification estimate .",
    "thus in fig .",
    "[ fig : velcurve ] we show the velocity curve for a range of assumed magnifications to illustrate this relative uncertaintly .",
    "velocities in the arc@xmath1core decrease monotonically from south to north in the core ( i.e. , within the central @xmath9 1 kpc ) and arc ( over a distance of @xmath49  or 2.5 kpc ) .",
    "thanks to the large magnification and bright line emission in the core , we can trace the velocity gradient even within the core over 2.3 , or @xmath49 seeing disks , so correlations due to overlapping seeing disks within the data are negligible .",
    "moreover , this causes the ratio of velocity gradient @xmath50  and central velocity dispersion , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , to not depend on seeing .",
    "we overlay the rotation curve for the local galaxy , ngc4419 ( fig .  [ fig : velcurve ] ) .",
    "this shows indeed that the velocity curve of the arc@xmath1 core is very similar to that of local nearby galaxies like ngc4419 .",
    "ngc4419 was chosen for this purpose because its asymptotic velocity matches that measured for the arc@xmath1core particularly well .",
    "due to the anisotropic lensing , we can not use the full two - dimensional velocity field of the arc@xmath1core galaxy to distinguish rotation from alternative models of the origin of the line emission such as an agn or starburst driven wind , or a merger of two galaxies .",
    "we therefore base our arguments on the whole of the rest - frame uv @xcite and optical ( this paper ) spectral properties .    for a luminous agn we would expect several characteristic bright emission lines in the rest - frame uv spectrum , such as nv1240 , siiv+o iv]1400 , civ1549 , c iii]+siiii]1900 , etc .",
    "instead @xcite observe an absorption line spectrum which is typical of an actively star - forming high - redshift galaxy .",
    "the optical emission lines are narrow , fwhm@xmath53  ( see table  [ tab : lineprops ] ) , with constant ( within the uncertainties ) line profiles , line ratios ( [ oiii]/ ) , and equivalent widths across both the arc and core .",
    "none of these properties provides an indication of the arc@xmath1core galaxy hosting a uv / optically bright agn    if the kinematics of the emission line gas were dominated by superwinds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one would not expect the line emission to have the same morphology as the bright continuum emission .",
    "line emission in the arc@xmath1core galaxy generally follows the continuum morphology , arguing against the superwind hypothesis . to quantify this ,",
    "we have compared the equivalent widths in the arc@xmath1core with a sample of 12 low redshift , low metallicity galaxies with active star - formation taken from @xcite .",
    "rest - frame  and [ oiii]5007 equivalent widths in the arc and core are for  and [ oiii]5007 , respectively , w()@xmath54 = 22  , w()@xmath55=46  , w([oiii]5007)@xmath54 = 89  , w([oiii]5007)@xmath55 = 171  .",
    "these values are within the broad range of equivalent widths measured in the integrated spectra of the low redshift sample of @xcite where the line emission is not dominated by superwinds .",
    "[ oiii]5007/  line ratios increase by up to 1 dex with increasing distance from the galactic disk in galaxies exhibiting superwinds due to the ( relative ) dominance of shock ionization at large distances from the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even when a strong wind is projected onto the galaxy continuum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* measure a variation of 0.3 dex in in the low metallicity dwarf galaxy , ngc1569 ) .",
    "the arc and core span a few kpc in the source plane , so that we would expect a change in line ratios if the emission was arising from the wind .",
    "we find however insignificant differences in [ oiii]/  line ratios , ( [ oiii]/)@xmath56 2.53 and ( [ oiii]/)@xmath57 2.48 in the arc and core , respectively .",
    "this of course does not imply the general absence of a superwind in this galaxy , it only indicates that the cores of the optical emission lines are not dominated by an outflow .",
    "we find a similar situation in the z=2.57 strongly star - forming submillimeter galaxy smmj14011 + 0252 ( nesvadba et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) .    to investigate whether the kinematics of the arc@xmath1core could be due to a merger",
    ", we have constructed a monte carlo simulation , evaluating the likelhood that two unrelated lbgs have similar r - g colors as that observed by @xcite for the arc and core . to make this comparison",
    ", we used the r@xmath58 g color distribution of @xcite as reference distribution for the colors of lbgs . in 95% of all cases ,",
    "color differences between two random pairs of lbgs are larger than @xmath59(r@xmath58g)@xmath600.39  the 1@xmath61 uncertainty of the r@xmath58 g color difference between the arc and the core .",
    "moreover , the light distribution appears very smooth and contiguous in the acs image with @xmath62  resolution .",
    "this means that either the light profiles of two merging galaxies would have to overall be very similar , or that their physical separation would have to be less than @xmath940 pc .",
    "given the regularity of the surface brightness distribution in the acs image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : acsimspifpos ] ) , this seems highly unlikely .",
    "the uniform line widths and [ oiii]/  ratios in the arc and core indicate similar gravitational potentials and overall gas ionization ( excitation and metallicity ) .",
    "in addition , if this were a merger , then the absence of obvious irregularities in the velocities and line widths as a function of projected position would be puzzling given the high physical resolution due to the strong lensing and the reasonable number of independent resolution elements across the arc@xmath1core . moreover",
    ", the good agreement of the position velocity diagram with the rotation curve of ngc4419 requires that the velocity difference , rotation speeds , positions and relative orientation of two merging galaxies are very well matched .",
    "this fine tuning of several degrees of freedom makes the merger scenario highly unlikely .",
    "@xcite studied the properties of rotation curves of nearby disk galaxies and found that low - mass spiral galaxies tend to rotation speeds that increase out to larger radii ( up to several kpc ) than do the more massive disk galaxies .",
    "however , the rotation curves of most galaxies , regardless of mass , appear to rise out to a few hundred parsecs and this rise corresponds roughly to the region consisting of the bulge of the galaxy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : velcurve ] , we show the high - resolution co rotation curve of the nearly edge on ( @xmath63 ) ngc4419 , a dwarf sba galaxy in the @xcite sample with a very similar position - velocity diagram as the arc@xmath1core .",
    "if the magnification in the arc does not strongly exceed the @xmath40 , then the two curves agree remarkably well .",
    "although this excellent agreement is coincidental , it is illustrative to compare the properties of the arc@xmath1core galaxy and ngc4419 .",
    "the mass of ngc4419 within @xmath64 kpc is @xmath65 , whereas at @xmath66 kpc , the enclosed mass is @xmath67 @xcite . as noted earlier ,",
    "this does emphasize that interpreting the velocity curve of the arc@xmath1core as a rotation curve is justifiable .",
    "more specifically , the acs morphology and velocity gradient of the arc@xmath1core galaxy are at least consistent with the assumption that this is a disk galaxy seen nearly edge - on .",
    "we fit the velocity curve of the core with a simple exponential disk model , accounting for the seeing , magnification by the gravitational lens ( @xmath40 ) , and coarse sampling of our data .",
    "the simulated data were extracted in the same way as our observational data .",
    "we obtain a robust fit for a mass of @xmath68 within a radius @xmath69 kpc , assuming an edge - on thin disk parallel to the lensing axis with no bulge , and similar disk scale - length as the typical lbg at z@xmath703 . extrapolating this fit out to @xmath71 kpc ( the typical half - light radius of @xmath6 lbgs ,",
    "* ) , we find @xmath72 . since it is difficult to place firm constraints on the inclination , we leave it unconstrained , and only note that , statistically , the mass will be a factor of 2 higher .",
    "we also measure a relatively large velocity dispersion in the core .",
    "if the dispersion is indeed due to the gravitational potential , then a significant part of the total kinetic energy might be in random motions , adding another factor @xmath73 to the true dynamical mass ( or @xmath74 ) .",
    "our mass estimate suggests a somewhat lower mass than the @xmath75  mass of the lensed @xmath76 lbg ms1512-cb58 that @xcite estimate from co line width , but agrees within factors of a few .",
    "it is also consistent with estimates of lbg masses based on emission line velocity dispersions ( such as , e.g. , the @xmath77 estimate of * ? ? ?",
    "* assuming a pressure - supported spheroidal mass distribution ) . the agreement becomes better if we apply the method of @xcite and measured velocity dispersions in the arc@xmath1core . using the @xmath78  of the high surface - brightness core ( which would dominate the spectrum if the source was not gravitationally lensed ) , we estimate a dynamical mass @xmath79(@xmath80 , if we use the integrated line emission from the arc and the core . ) given that we are estimating the dynamical mass within roughly a half - light radius for the typical lbg at z@xmath93 , it also agrees well with the mass estimates based on sed fitting @xcite .    since @xmath6 lbgs have co - moving densities similar to local luminous ( @xmath81 ) galaxies , high star - formation rates , and complex morphologies , @xcite argued that they represent the formation of the spheroidal component of massive galaxies .",
    "our results have some bearing on this issue .",
    "the similarity with the rotation curves of local spiral galaxies , e.g. , ngc4419 , comprises the rise and overall shape within @xmath5 kpc radius , where we have a robust lensing model , and out to @xmath82 kpc with somewhat larger uncertainties related to the higher magnification .",
    "the low - redshift , @xmath83 galaxies in @xcite have an average ( and rms ) mass within 0.5 kpc of 2.9@xmath842.0@xmath8510@xmath86 ( which range from @xmath7010@xmath87 to 7 @xmath8510@xmath86 ) , similar to our @xmath88 , including the statistical inclination correction .",
    "obviously , due to the similar rotation velocities and sizes , the mass surface densities of the core and local comparison sample are also very similar : 3@xmath8510@xmath89 pc@xmath90 for the core and 3.7@xmath842.6@xmath8510@xmath89 pc@xmath90 for the average and rms in the @xcite sample .",
    "these similarities lend support to the conclusion of @xcite that in fact lbgs could be the inner spheroid component during a period of rapid growth . more subtly",
    ", this implies that perhaps the full mass of the central few kpcs ( bulges ? ) of present - day @xmath83 galaxies was already in place by @xmath15 .",
    "given the results of @xcite , the central few kpc are probably mostly in a gaseous phase and not a complete stellar bulge .",
    "we discuss these hypotheses in more detail below .",
    "we constrain the stellar population from the rest - frame uv spectrum of @xcite .",
    "a detailed assessment of the uv absorption line spectrum is difficult because of inadequate signal - to - noise ratio and strong night sky lines at the wavelengths of some of the important diagnostic absorption lines .",
    "however , we obtain a good fit to the overall spectral energy distribution for rest - frame uv wavelengths between @xmath91   using starburst99 @xcite for a model with a 60 - 110  myr old stellar population and low extinction . our data are not sufficient to explicitly measure the extinction . in the following ,",
    "we therefore use the average e(b - v)@xmath600.17 found by @xcite for a sample of @xmath6 lbgs with similar ly@xmath92 emission line equivalent width , although our sed fitting formally suggests no extinction .",
    "such a model correctly predicts the k - band continuum magnitude we observe with spiffi ( k@xmath93 ) , and implies a stellar mass @xmath94 .",
    "convolving the @xcite spectrum with the filter transmission curves of @xcite to select lyman break galaxies verifies that the arc@xmath1core formally fulfills the color criterion for @xmath6 lbgs ( including the fact that the lensing - corrected magnitude fullfill the spectroscopic @xmath95 magnitude limit used in selecting lbgs by steidel and collaborators ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found a large reservoir of molecular gas in the lensed @xmath76 lbg ms1512-cb58 , sufficient to sustain intense star - formation over several orbital time scales .",
    "e.g. , assuming a gas fraction of @xmath114 , star - formation at a rate of 11  yr@xmath23 could be sustained for @xmath115  myr . from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting of a sample of lbgs , @xcite found a median star - formation time scale of @xmath9300  myrs .",
    "this is in rough agreement with our dynamical time estimate , and a few times larger than the @xmath116  myrs we find for the age of stellar population in the arc@xmath1core .",
    "of course this can only provide only limited support for this general argument given the degeneracies between age and extinction and the lack of a unique fit to any sed given the wide range of possible and plausible star - formation histories .    within the context of models where galaxies grow hierarchically , angular momentum in galaxies",
    "is a result of tidal torgues from neighboring mass concentrations @xcite . in ( @xmath117)cdm ,",
    "these torques are generated by merging dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "if this hypothesis for the generation of angular momentum is correct , then our observed rotation curve in the arc@xmath1core is a direct link to the spin and specific angular momentum of the dark matter halo . we observe a significant amount of specific angular momentum in the arc@xmath1core , namely ,    @xmath118    where r@xmath119 is the e - folding radius of the light profile , and v@xmath120 is the circular velocity of the disk .",
    "the light profile of the arc@xmath1core is not consistent with an exponential disk , which is perhaps not surprising given the complex lensing configuration .",
    "@xcite find that exponential light profiles dominate their sample of @xmath6 actively star - forming galaxies in the hst _ ultra deep field_. if the arc@xmath1core is a typical lbg , then the magnification is likely not a simple cut along the radius of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , we simply estimate the specific angular momentum at the approximate radius for which we have direct measurements ( i.e. , @xmath121 kpc , similar to the typical half - light radius of an lbg ; * ? ? ?",
    "the specific angular momentum is within the lower tail of the specific angular momentum distribution of local spiral galaxies ( @xmath910@xmath122 h@xmath123 km s@xmath23 kpc at v@xmath124@xmath9200 km s@xmath23 , see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "although the arc@xmath1core is at the low end of the distribution , formally it is consistent , and most of the difference can be attributed to the generally larger radii over which the specific angular momenta of local disks are estimated ( which for the flat part of the rotation curve increases linearly with radius ) .",
    "moreover , simple models of the evolution of the angular momentum of dark matter halos predicted a decrease in angular momentum with increasing redshift ( j@xmath125(z)@xmath126(1+z)@xmath127 for an isothermal halo with a binding energy consistent with simple kinetic theory , i.e. , e@xmath128@xmath70m@xmath125v@xmath129 , where v@xmath130 is the circular velocity of the halo at the virial radius ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the large specific angular momentum observed in local disk galaxies is difficult to explain , unless by postulating that the specific angular momentum of the gas is roughly conserved during collapse and similar to the specific angular momentum of the dark matter halo .",
    "this is closely related to the well - known `` angular momentum problem '' and it is not a trivial issue . given the specific angular momentum of the arc@xmath1core is similar to local spirals , we are tempted to estimate the dark matter halo mass of the arc@xmath1core galaxy from the kinematics of the emission line gas within the formalism of the hierarchical model @xcite .",
    "hypothesizing that the specific angular momentum of the arc@xmath1core approximately reflects that of the halo , would imply that we can estimate the dark matter halo mass using the observed kinematics of the arc@xmath1core . with the virial formula of , e.g. , @xcite , and the measured circular velocity over a radius of a few kpc ( about 190 km s@xmath23 ) , we find ,    @xmath131    based on correlation amplitudes and number densities of lbgs at @xmath132 , @xcite estimate dark matter halo masses of @xmath133 m@xmath134 , similar , within @xmath135 , to our estimate using the kinematics of the arc@xmath1core .",
    "this suggests that the measured circular velocity roughly approximates the virial velocity of the dark matter halo .",
    "@xcite found a similar result in a study of uv - selected galaxies at z@xmath92 .",
    "we find a low dynamical mass for the arc@xmath1core compared to the large dark matter halo mass , but within the range of dynamical masses that @xcite found for a larger sample of lbgs with measured velocity dispersions .",
    "this indicates that in the general lbg population , only a small fraction of the total available baryons have likely collapsed to the center of the halo .",
    "our best - fit mass estimate for the arc@xmath1core is @xmath136 m@xmath137 within @xmath1382 kpc ( i.e. , within a typical half - light radius of an lbg at z@xmath93.2 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which implies a log ratio of baryonic to dark mass of @xmath139 dex or @xmath140 to 2% .",
    "this is actually a lower limit since we have not accounted for a contribution of dark matter within 2 kpc of the dynamical center .",
    "we can use results from the literature to repeat this comparison with a complementary approach , in analogy to the analysis of @xcite for @xmath17 uv - selected star - forming galaxies ( `` bm / bx '' ) . using the @xmath141 halo mass deduced from the measured large - scale distribution and the typical stellar mass of @xmath142 lbgs derived from multi - color photometry , @xmath143 @xcite",
    ", we find a ratio of baryonic to dark matter masses of log @xmath144=@xmath581.6@xmath840.4 or 1 - 6% .",
    "given the large uncertainties in any such estimate , this is in good agreement with the proceeding results based on dynamical mass estimates .",
    "the best - fitting cosmological parameters imply that the fraction of baryonic to total mass is about @xmath1450.17 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if we take our estimates literally , then this will imply that only @xmath146% of the baryons in a typical z@xmath93 lbg have already collapsed to @xmath147 .",
    "for the milky way , the ratio of total baryonic to dark mass is 0.08@xmath840.01 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite find a value similar to the milky way in the @xmath17 `` bm / bx '' galaxies .",
    "the halos of the milky way and the bm / bx galaxies have very similar mass and exceed the typical mass of a @xmath6 lbg halo by only about a factor 3 @xcite .",
    "finding such a low value in comparison with other galaxy populations at low and high redshift implies that the `` baryonic collapse fraction '' of @xmath6 lbgs is generally lower .",
    "this suggests that lbgs perhaps formed relatively inefficiently or have particularly strong feedback making the collapse appear relatively inefficient .",
    "direct evidence for lbgs having significant outflows is substantial @xcite , supporting the later hypothesis .",
    "the rather small differences in the halo masses and large differences in the collapse fraction might be evidence that the collapse of baryons or feedback have a strong impact on galaxy evolution in general , and that merging of dark matter halos is not the only significant parameter in determing the characteristics of galaxies .",
    "we presented an analysis of the strongly lensed ( @xmath40 ) lyman break galaxy 1e0657 - 56 arc@xmath1core galaxy at redshift @xmath26 , based on spiffi integral - field rest - frame optical spectroscopy , complemented with rest - frame uv imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "this galaxy is an excellent target for studying the fine spatial details of a @xmath6 lyman break galaxy .",
    "we extracted the rest - frame uv colors of the arc@xmath1core from the deep fors spectroscopy of @xcite , and measured directly that the galaxy fulfills the lyman break criterion , including the @xmath95 mag limit , imposed on spectroscopically identified sources , for an unlensed source .",
    "the arc@xmath1core is near the peak of the lbg redshift distribution , and its unmagnified size , optical emission line properties , mass - to - light ratio , and stellar age are within the range estimated for the overall population .",
    "therefore , it is particularly well suited for a detailed analysis of its small - scale properties .",
    "we find a slightly lower star - formation rate than average , most likely due to our uncertain extinction estimate , likely underlying  absorption , or missing flux by not accounting for unlensed or multiply lensed regions of the galaxy .    through studying magnified high surface brightness regions of an lbg at @xmath6",
    ", we can investigate the structure and nature of lbgs at high physical resolution .",
    "the dynamical mass within 500 pc is about @xmath148 , while at about 2 kpc radius ( approximately the half - light radius of a typical @xmath6 lbg , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mass is similar to the average stellar mass @xmath149 of lbgs .",
    "stellar masses derived from sed modelling include light at larger radii and make assumptions about the initial mass function that may be unwarranted and generally lead to higher masses @xcite , so any discrepancy is not totally unexpected . however , our estimated mass of the core is also typical for the bulges of local @xmath150 spiral galaxies .",
    "in addition , the arc@xmath1core has a specific angular momentum similar to that of local spiral galaxies .",
    "the combination of mass surface density , metallicity and the dynamical time perhaps suggests an interesting evolutionary picture for the 1e0657 - 56 arc@xmath1core . since the properties of the 1e0657 - 56 arc@xmath1core are well within the typical range of lbgs , this outline of the evolution of the 1e0657 - 56 arc@xmath1core might , with some caution , be applicable to @xmath6 lbgs generally .",
    "compared to local spirals , most of the mass within 500 pc for the 1e0657 - 56 core appears to be already in place .",
    "however , the metallicity in the nuclei of low - redshift spirals is approximately solar , while we have found that the 1e0657 - 56 arc@xmath1core has at most about half solar gas - phase abundances , and this estimate is clearly dominated by the emission from the core .",
    "we do not know the gas fraction of the 1e0657 - 56 arc@xmath1core , however , co observations of the lensed z@xmath602.7 lbg ms1512-cb58 by @xcite suggest that lbgs might be gas rich , with gas fractions of possibly up to 50% . for a simple closed box model with such high gas fractions ,",
    "the metallicity will double within several 10 to 100  myrs .",
    "this time estimate likely increases by factors of a few if including outflows or inflows with the metallicity of the intergalactic medium at @xmath142 .",
    "our orbital time estimate suggests that the intense star - formation is likely to last long enough to increase the metallicity to about solar .    because @xmath151 lbgs have similar co - moving densities as local luminous ( @xmath81 ) galaxies",
    ", @xcite suggested that they represent the formation of the spheroidal component of massive galaxies .",
    "our analysis suggests that this hypothesis is plausible since we measure a mass and mass surface density similar to local @xmath152 spiral galaxies , and also fulfill the metallicity constraint , after allowing for further evolution in the on - going episode of intense star - formation .",
    "moreover , the low baryon collapse fraction within @xmath147 might hint that a substantial amount of gas resides on larger scales within the halo ( maybe gas blown out during intense star - formation or pre - enriched material from the igm ) .",
    "however , we also find @xmath153 , significantly larger than the @xmath154 of bulges ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "thus , if the arc@xmath1core is representative of the overall population , lbgs will have to lose factors of a few in their circular velocities to have @xmath155 ratios consistent with local bulges , and certainly substantially more angular momentum to evolve into massive ellipticals .",
    "currently , very few models address the evolution of individual disk galaxies within the context of the hierarchical model in detail , which makes a quantitative comparison rather difficult .",
    "overall , models of the formation of large scale structure and the evolution of galaxies within a @xmath117cdm cosmology favour `` inside - out '' galaxy evolution , where the inner regions of galaxies form earlier than the peripheries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a scenario quite naturally explains observations at low redshift , such as metallicity and stellar population ( age ) gradients observed in local galaxies .",
    "although these models produce inner regions of galaxies that collapse relatively early , unfortunately they also predict that only a relatively small amount of mass will be in place by @xmath6 compared to the final mass of the galaxy .",
    "most of the mass at small radii is acquired rather late , more likely around redshifts of - order @xmath156 @xcite . however , as emphasized by @xcite , the timing and spatial distribution of the star - formation `` history '' depends crucially on the infall history and on how efficiently the kinetic energy gained from dynamical and mechanical heating during collapse is dissipated .",
    "they show that the gas in galaxies with large dissipation efficiency will strongly fragment , and interactions between individual subclumps and dynamical friction will make the fragments coalesce to the central regions more rapidly .",
    "in other words , the efficiency of dissipation and fragmentation may essentially be a free parameter which could be constrained observationally .    in comparison to local @xmath157 spiral galaxies ,",
    "we find in the arc@xmath1core at @xmath0 a significant and comparable mass surface density , while the overall relative mass is rather low . in light of the models",
    "already discussed , this might indicate highly dissipative gas collapse during the earliest phases of galaxy evolution . the later evolution and perhaps the formation of the disk",
    "might either be driven by infall of material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by the merger of gas rich galaxies supported by strong feedback to prevent the baryons from collapsing into the central regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the latter of these hypotheses might explain the apparent inefficiency of the baryon collapse of the z@xmath93 lbgs compared to galaxies at lower redshift .",
    "we would like to thank the spiffi team for carrying out the observations and c. forman - jones for responding to our request for data so promptly and to her and her collaborators for sharing their reduced acs data with us before publication .",
