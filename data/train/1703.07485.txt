    "thermonuclear ( type - i ) bursts arise from unstable ignition of accreted fuel ( typically mixed hydrogen and helium ) on the surface of accreting neutron stars in low - mass binary systems .",
    "such events are of high priority for observers , as they provide information about the fuel composition , accretion rate , and even neutron star spin , mass and radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a key component contributing to our understanding of the burning physics is numerical modelling of the complex series of nuclear reactions which trigger and power the bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to date",
    ", the degree to which predictions of numerical models have been compared in detail to observations is limited ; this paper is part of a wider effort to address this situation .    the physical conditions and processes which broadly influence the burst behaviour are relatively well understood .",
    "the primary determinant is the local accretion rate @xmath0 , frequently expressed as a fraction of the eddington rate @xmath1 , at which the outwards force due to radiation pressure ( assuming spherical symmetry ) equals the surface gravity .",
    "the eddington rate is also the predicted threshold at which the burning is expected to stabilise ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although observationally bursting behaviour appears to cease for many sources at a substantially lower level @xcite .    for systems accreting a mix of hydrogen and helium at typical accretion rates ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "the fuel layer is hot enough that h will burn stably via the hot - cno cycle .",
    "this process is limited by @xmath3-decay , and will exhaust the h at the base of the layer in a time @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which depends only on the accreted h - fraction @xmath5 and the metallicity @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the composition of the fuel layer at ignition may vary , and a number of categories have been identified by numerical studies . if the recurrence time is short , the burst will ignite in a mixed h / he environment , leading to a `` case 1 '' @xcite or `` prompt mixed '' @xcite burst . at lower accretion rates ,",
    "the recurrence time may exceed @xmath7 , leading to ignition in a pure - he layer , i.e. `` case 2 '' or `` delayed helium '' bursts . at even lower rates",
    ", it is thought that h - burning too will become unstable , leading to ignition via that mechanism ; but no unambiguous examples of such bursts have been observed .",
    "an additional ignition case is provided by neutron stars in ultracompact systems , which likely accrete ( almost ? ) pure he . here",
    "the ignition will always be in a h - poor environment , largely independently of the accretion rate .",
    "the nuclear energy generation during the burst is related to the average h - fraction in the fuel @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "the composition of the fuel may be inferred from the @xmath10 parameter , the ratio of burst energy to accretion energy over the burst recurrence time . for a neutron star of mass @xmath11 , radius @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gravitational redshift at the neutron star surface , given by @xmath15 . provided",
    "the accretion rate is proportional to the persistent flux @xmath16 , @xmath10 may be measured ( up to a factor corresponding to the ratio of the anisotropy of burst and persistent emission ) as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the bolometric correction to the ( band - limited ) flux @xmath16 , @xmath19 is the ( regular ) burst recurrence time , and @xmath20 the burst bolometric fluence ( total energy ) .",
    "the composition of the fuel may also be deduced from the shape of the lightcurve .",
    "he burns during the burst via the triple-@xmath10 reaction , which proceeds on a much faster timescale than the hot - cno , rp- and @xmath21 reactions which burn h. the higher the he mass fraction , the faster the burning will proceed during the burst , reflecting in the burst rise and duration , as well as the timescale @xmath22 ( the ratio of the fluence to the peak flux ) .    the numerical codes that have been used to compare to observations fall into three broad classes .",
    "the first class determines the ignition conditions given the accretion rate and fuel composition , and predicts the burst recurrence time and energetics .",
    "while this model has been developed to compare with the inferred atmospheric expansion during a burst as suggested by measurements of burst oscillations @xcite , it has also been used to compare with observations of bursts at low accretion rates @xcite .",
    "the primary disadvantage of such models is that they do not follow the time - dependent compositional structure of the atmosphere , which is significantly modified by the thermonuclear burning .",
    "the next class of models are one - zone time - dependent codes that simulate some fraction of the nuclear reaction network .",
    "such codes have been used to demonstrate the extent of the rp - process that powers mixed h / he bursts @xcite , as well as serving to probe the sensitivity of burst lightcurves to individual reaction rates @xcite .",
    "the current ( practical ) state of the art for burst modelling is in 1-d multi - zone models that track the full extent of the nuclear reaction networks .",
    "codes in this class include kepler @xcite ; the general relativistic hydrodynamics code agile , coupled with a nuclear reaction network @xcite , and mesa @xcite .",
    "1-d multi - zone models have been used to make the most detailed comparisons of observations to models , most notably for gs  1826@xmath2324  @xcite . however , these comparisons are generally limited in the extent of the sources and the observational data utilised . these limitations , despite the extensive modeling capabilities ( and accumulated observational data )",

    "we present a sample of observations of thermonuclear bursts , intended for comparison with numerical models .",
    "the objectives of the sample assembly are twofold : first , as test cases to quantify variations between different codes ( and hence intrinsic model uncertainties ) ; and second , as examples that may be used to refine the system parameters by direct comparison with individual codes .",
    "we deliberately take a pragmatic approach which incorporates constraints on system parameters obtained by comparison with particular numerical models ( of varying degrees of fidelity ) .",
    "while this approach introduces dependence of the system parameters on the specific models chosen for these analyses , this dependence is unimportant for either of the two objectives described above . for the code comparisons ,",
    "the specific choice of input parameters does not matter , provided they are plausible ; and the parameters we have adopted are the best current parameter estimates for the systems studied . as for improving the system parameters via more detailed comparisons with individual models , the adopted system parameters provided here should be viewed as a suggested starting point .",

    "we caution that in most cases these parameters are not precisely known , however for the purposes of deciding upon suitable values for simulation tests , we adopt values which are generally consistent with the observed burst properties and/or the neutron star population .",

    "the measured @xmath10-values for the source , at @xmath29 , strongly suggest a high fraction of h in the burst fuel , and so we adopt the solar value , i.e. @xmath30 , for the accreted h fraction .",
    "the lack of variation in burst fluence ( i.e. total burst energy ) over a range in accretion rate was taken as evidence by @xcite that the fuel must be deficient in cno nuclei .",
    "otherwise , steady ( hot - cno ) h - burning between the bursts would signficantly change the fuel composition at ignition , as the burst recurrence time decreased from around 6  hr to 4  hr .",
    "a subsequent comparison of burst properties , including the detailed shape of the lightcurve , with time - dependent 1-d model predictions by kepler @xcite led instead to the conclusion that the accreted fuel must be approximately solar in composition , i.e. @xmath31 , at odds with the earlier analysis @xcite .",

    "earlier analyses of samples including these data have demonstrated evidence for an increased contribution of persistent flux during bursts , possibly arising from the effects of poynting - robertson drag on the inner accretion disk @xcite .",
    "while the fractional increase in the persistent flux can be @xmath43 , this contribution is a small fraction of the burst flux , and so any correction required to the burst flux is also small ( of order a few per cent , similar to the intrinsic uncertainty of the time - resolved flux measurements ) .",

    "we measured the average recurrence time of each train by assigning a trial integer value to each burst , and then performing a linear least - squares fit to the times .",
    "the trial values were determined by dividing the time since the first burst , by the minimum burst separation of the train ; we subsequently adjusted the sequence numbers to minimise the rms value of the fit .",

    "we estimated the accretion rate @xmath0 as a fraction of the eddington rate @xmath28 , as @xmath47 where @xmath16 is the average persistent flux over the burst train , and @xmath27 the estimated source distance from table [ tab : sources ] .",
    "this estimate neglects the possible anisotropy of the persistent emission , so must be taken as a guide only .",
    "the identification of suitable burst trains for 4u  1820@xmath23303  was made difficult by the relatively small number of bursts available in the minbar sample .",

    "for each sequence , we observed a pair of bursts within a few hours of each other , and a third burst some days earlier or later .",
    "we ultimately rejected one of these sequences , in 2009 may ( mjd  54980 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because there were significant variations in the persistent flux ( and spectral shape ) over the interval , and it was not possible to be confident about the recurrence time for the close pair of bursts , due to data gaps between them .",
    "this was not the case for the remaining train , in 1997 may ( mjd  50572 ) , and so we retained this set of bursts . with only one burst observed by _ rxte _ in this sequence ,",

    "the nearest observations in time preceeding ( following ) that observation were 13  d before ( 3  d after ) , so any possible test for periodicity over that time range would likely be uninformative given the likely phase drift of the burst sequence . assuming that the separation of 1.89  hr does reflect a regular recurrence time",

    "with * ? ? ?",
    "the constraints on recurrence times for the superbursts from 4u  1636@xmath23536 is poor due to the low duty cycle of observations between the detected events .",
    "the superburst in our sample was preceded by another @xmath48 years prior .",
    "however , the inferred accretion column is approximately twice the ignition column , suggesting that the actual recurrence time is closer to @xmath49 years @xcite .",
    "in addition to the properties of the burst itself reported in table [ tab : bursts ] , we constrained the `` quench time '' corresponding to the period following the superburst during which normal thermonuclear burning is suppressed .",
    "the first thermonuclear ( h / he ) event detected from 4u  1636@xmath23536  following the superburst was on mjd 51985.5 ( _ bepposax _ observation 10898 ) , giving @xmath50  d. the observation during which that event was detected commenced 17.5  hr before the burst was detected , and had a duty cycle of @xmath51% , with interruptions due to the low - earth orbit .",
    "the coverages suggests a @xmath52% chance that an earlier burst could have been missed , so that the quench time could have been shorter by up to 17.5  hr .",
    "however , no intervening observations were made to rule out additional bursts missed earlier than that observation .",
    "we measured the persistent flux in the 325  kev band from _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ observations by fitting commonly - used phenomenological models , and converted the integrated flux to a bolometric value by applying a bolometric correction for each observation .",
    "the correction was estimated by fitting to _ rxte _ pca and hexte data a broad - band model typically comprising an absorbed comptonisation component ( comptt in xspec ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , usually with a gaussian component representing fe k@xmath10 emission in the range 6.46.7  kev .",
    "we measured the 325  kev flux from each fit , and then created an ideal response ( using dummyrsp in xspec ) covering the energy range 0.11000  kev , and integrated the flux over this range , excluding the effects of neutral absorption .",
    "we estimated the bolometric correction as the ratio of the unabsorbed 0.11000  kev flux to the absorbed 325  kev flux ; for the observations here , the correction was typically in the range 1.42 .",
    "this approach is reliable provided that the contribution to the bolometric flux outside the range to which pca and hexte are sensitive ( typically 3100  kev ) is small ( or at least consistent ) .",
    "however , it is known that for gs  1826@xmath2324 , that additional low - energy contributions may arise at times , so that the persistent flux measured by _",
    "rxte _ in the 325  kev band is not always a reliable estimator of the accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some observations",
    ", there is evidence for unusually low @xmath10-values , suggesting that a significant fraction of the x - ray flux is emitted outside the _ rxte _ band ; contemporaneous _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations suggest that this flux may be emitted as a low - temperature ( @xmath53  kev ) thermal component .",
    "thus , we avoided from our data selection bursts from such epochs identified by @xcite , including those from 2003 april , and also the observations from 1998 june and 1997 november .",
    "an additional epoch of unusually low @xmath54 is from observations in 2006 august , and was also excluded .",
    "the remaining set of three burst trains have broadly consistent @xmath10-values , but we caution that there may yet be additional systematic errors contributing to the determination of the accretion rate in this ( and possibly other ) systems .      here we describe the approach by which the values of the neutron star radius , redshift , and surface gravity for gs  1826@xmath2324  were chosen .",
    "we replicated the analysis of @xcite with updated analysis results and an improved method to determine the best - fit system parameters .",
    "we selected the train of bursts observed in 2000",
    "september , with a recurrence time of 4.177  hr , similar to that used previously .",
    "the 7 bursts observed with _ rxte _ are augmented by the observation of 25 additional bursts with _ bepposax _ over the same interval , with the complete train spanning 12  d. however , the entire sequence of bursts is not consistent with a steady recurrence time , likely due to small variations in accretion rate .",
    "thus , we restricted the sequence to a shorter interval covering the _ rxte _ bursts , beginning on mjd  51810 and spanning almost 4  d ( as plotted in fig .",
    "[ example ] ) .",
    "we then compared the averaged lightcurve ( calculated from the _ rxte _ bursts only ) with examples predicted by the kepler code , tabulated in @xcite .",
    "@xcite found excellent agreement between the observed lightcurve and a model referred to as `` a3 '' , with solar composition , an accretion rate of @xmath55 . in the sample of @xcite , the accretion rate",
    "is quantified in terms of the eddington value , defined as @xmath56 .",
    "thus , for model a3 , the accretion rate was @xmath57 , and this model corresponds to `` a05d '' in the @xcite sample .    in our revised comparison , we simultaneously matched the lightcurve and the recurrence time , using a markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) code emcee @xcite to marginalise over the three parameters of interest : the redshift @xmath25 ( by which the lightcurve will be stretched when transforming into the observer s frame ) , the relative intensity scale , including the distance and redshift : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the burst luminosity predicted by kepler , @xmath27 is the distance , @xmath60 takes into account the possible anisotropy of the burst emission ( see also appendix [ distance ] , and @xmath61 the observed burst flux .",
    "a third parameter is related to the offset in time between the model and observation , and has no physical meaning .",
    "our initial runs with this code did not match the recurrence time , and to ensure that the model - predicted burst interval ( when scaled by @xmath25 ) matched that observed , we weighted this parameter in the likelihood function by a factor of 50 .",
    "this ensured in the subsequent comparisons that the redshifted model recurrence time matched that observed to within a few percent .",
    "the comparison with model a05d , as used by @xcite , gave good agreement with the observed lightcurves , although requiring a redshift of @xmath62 .",
    "following the approach of @xcite , we transformed the model results ( calculated in a newtonian frame ) to the observer s frame assuming that the gravity , and the newtonian and the general - relativistic neutron star masses are identical .",
    "this implies that the radius required for the newtonian and general - relativistic gravity will be different , and the corresponding radius ( for a neutron star mass of @xmath63 ) implied by our comparison of model a05d was 8.5  km , well below the lower limit of 10.4  km inferred for a wide range of neutron stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , we made a limited exploration of alternative models , focussing on those with solar composition .",
    "the comparison with model a028 gave a best - fit redshift of @xmath64 , implying a radius of 12.1  km , well within the expected range .",
    "the accretion rate ( in units of the eddington rate ) for this model is 0.082 , which is somewhat higher than that inferred for the 2000  sep epoch , at 0.0692 ; but may be consistent taking into account the persistent emission anistropy . @xcite estimated the ratio of persistent to burst anisotropies at @xmath65 , implying @xmath66 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in that case , the luminosity ( and hence accretion rate ) inferred from the persistent flux would be higher , bringing the observation estimate roughly in line with the value assumed for run a028 .",
    "the corresponding distance is @xmath67  kpc .",
    "we do not quote errors on these parameters , as the lightcurve comparison ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gslcompare ] ) is not of sufficient quality to have confidence in the posterior distributions ( the estimated probability densities for the model parameters ) .",

    "the approach adopted for sax  j1808.4@xmath233658 was necessarily different , as this source has not exhibited regular bursts in previous observations . the persistent flux ( and hence accretion rate )",
    "varied significantly over the time at which the bursts were observed in 2002 october , and so the burst separations ( and hence , presumably , the recurrence times ) vary significantly .",
    "furthermore , the burst separations are all longer than 12  hr , so that many data gaps are present between each burst , introduced by the interruptions in the visibility of the source due to the observing satellite s @xmath70-min low - earth orbit .",
    "@xcite compared the observed burst times with the predictions of a numerical ignition model , to constrain the system parameters . for the purposes of this paper , we have revised the analysis of those authors , to reconcile the changes in the _",

    "the settle model predicts burst parameters in the neutron star frame , given an inferred accretion rate .",
    "necessarily , we adopt the average inferred accretion rate ( based on linear interpolation between each observation ) for each burst interval , as settle does not simulate varying @xmath0 .",
    "the redshift @xmath25 and ( newtonian ) surface gravity @xmath26 are fixed in the settle code , at the values listed in table [ tab : sources ] so the results are implicitly for those values .",
    "the best - fit parameters we report are dependent on the fidelity of the model , which does not take into account all of the underlying physics , such as the effects of thermal and compositional inertia .",
    "more detailed models , such as kepler @xcite can provide more rigorous modelling of the underlying physics , however are computationally expensive and so impractical for the monte carlo approach adopted here .",
    "however , kepler simulations to reproduce the bursts observed from sax  j1808.4@xmath233658  during the 2002 outburst have been performed recently , demonstrating that the assumption of a constant accretion rate between bursts results in the recurrence time being underestimated , when compared to the scenario in which the accretion rate decreases between bursts ( johnston et al .",
    "2017 , in preparation ) . to account for this bias",
    ", we corrected the recurrence time predictions of settle using correction factors determined by kepler .",
    "the correction factor depends on the @xmath0 gradient , and thus is different for each burst .",
    "we adopt correction factors for each of the seven predicted bursts of sax  j1808.4@xmath233658 , which vary from @xmath72 1 for the first burst to @xmath72 1.2 for the final burst .",
    "we infer the persistent and burst anisotropy factors ( @xmath73 and @xmath60 respectively ) from the scaling factors and find @xmath73 = 1.05@xmath740.01 and @xmath60 = 0.91@xmath75 .",
    "this implies an inclination of 62@xmath741@xmath76 .",
    "note that the error on the inclination is statistical only , and does not include the contribution from uncertainties in the mass and radius , due to the fixed values adopted in the settle model .",
    "as with the analysis of @xcite , our maximum - likelihood solution predicts an additional pair of bursts between the first pair of observed bursts , on mjd  52562.41363 and 52564.30515 ( # 1 and 2 from * ? ? ?",
    "these events would have fallen in data gaps , which explains why they were not observed .",
    "we thus report the burst separations for the last two bursts observed during the 2002 october outburst as the recurrence time ; for the second burst , we estimate the recurrence time inferred from the burst train modelling based on the simulated time of the preceding event .",
    "we note that the inferred recurrence time of 16.55  hr for the second burst observed with _ rxte _",

    "the burst lightcurves show clear differences related to the inferred composition and accretion rate . for 4u  1820@xmath23303 ,",
    "the burst lightcurves are short , with durations ( defined as the interval over which the luminosity exceeds 10% of the maximum ) of 15  s or so .",
    "each of these bursts exhibits strong photospheric radius expansion , and the quality of the spectral fits during the radius expansion episodes are relatively poor ( reduced-@xmath77 values in the range 28 ) . as @xmath0 increases , the burst timescale increases slightly ( @xmath78 to @xmath79  s ) , which qualitatively supports the presence of a small amount of h in the accreted fuel . with smaller recurrence time",
    ", there is less time to burn the accreted h , and the mass fraction at ignition will be larger .    the bursts from sax  j1808.4@xmath233658 , although also thought to be powered primarily by he , have a notably different morphology , with an extended radius - expansion phase at roughly constant luminosity .",
    "the timescale variation for sax  j1808.4@xmath233658 is in the opposite direction , with the burst timescale and duration becoming shorter at higher accretion rates . here",
    "the recurrence time is long enough that any accreted h has already been exhausted at the base , so that lower accretion rate allows a larger pile of he to accumulate .",
    "the resulting increased fluence thus requires a longer interval emitting at the eddington luminosity , with some of the additional energy likely exported as kinetic energy of outflowing material .",
    "the bursts from gs  1826@xmath2324 are different again , showing the much slower ( @xmath80  s ) rises and long rp - process powered tails characteristic of these mixed h / he bursts . the peak luminosity is significantly smaller than for the he - rich bursts , and durations are approximately a factor of 5 longer .",
    "the burst profiles show only very subtle variations from epoch to epoch , with the peak flux decreasing slightly , while the timescale increases , as the accretion rate increases .",
    "the superburst profile is principally distinguished from the shorter , h or h / he events by the orders - of - magnitude longer timescale , with a duration of more than 2  hr .",

    "an important source of systematic uncertainty in the determination of persistent and burst luminosities is the source distance @xmath27 , and in combination , the degree of anisotropy of the burst and persistent emission , parameterised as @xmath60 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "anisotropy of the burst ( and persistent ) flux is expected given the strongly non - spherically symmetric geometry introduced by the accretion disk and binary companion . while the distances to burst sources have been estimated with moderate precision from observations of radius - expansion bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these measurements implicitly also depend on the burst anisotropy . strictly speaking , distances estimated in such a manner correspond to @xmath145 , and in general it is not possible to separate these quantities to derive the physical distance @xmath27 , independently .",
    "the definition of the anisotropy factor @xmath60 follows that of @xcite , such that for a total burst luminosity @xmath146 , the measured burst flux would be given by @xmath147 from the above relation , we understand that @xmath148 corresponds to isotropic emission in all directions , while @xmath149 indicates that the burst flux toward the observer is _ in excess _ of the isotropic value , i.e. preferential beaming in our direction . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the values of @xmath60 and @xmath73 depend upon the system inclination and the structure of the accretion disk , neither of which are well constrained .    for 4u  1636@xmath23536",
    ", we estimated the distance based on measurements of the burst emission from photospheric radius - expansion ( pre ) bursts in minbar , assuming that they reach the eddington limit .",
    "this follows the approach of @xcite , but the burst flux measurements have been updated with the latest pca response matrices , and the effects of deadtime in the burst spectra have been included .",
    "the overall effect on the distances ( compared to the previous analyses ) is a reduction of 510% .",
    "we also incorporated the assumed gravitational redshift at the surface , as listed in table [ tab : sources ] .",
    "the anisotropy of burst emission for 4u  1636@xmath23536 can be estimated from the inclination of the binary system with respect to the observer s line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "optical observations constrain the inclination angle to the range @xmath150 @xcite , which implies @xmath151 for a thin disk ( larger values for smaller angles ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observation of a broad fluorescent iron line favors a large inclination angle @xcite , but this depends strongly on the interpretation of the reflection spectrum .",
    "similarly , different constraints can be derived from the reflection signal during the superburst from this source @xcite .",
    "therefore , an uncertainty of several tens of percents must be taken into account for the burst luminosity of 4u  1636@xmath23536 .",
    "@xcite derived an upper limit on the distance ( combined with the burst anisotropy ) for gs  1826@xmath2324  of @xmath152  kpc .",
    "while our lightcurve comparisons for this source do not take into account the blackbody normalisation , as was analysed by @xcite , our derived system constraints are otherwise broadly consistent with those authors .",
    "however , our best - fit value based on the comparison with model a028 of @xcite is 6.1  kpc , slightly higher than the inferred limit .",
    "one additional consistency check that we can make is to compare the expected eddington flux for the adopted system parameters , with that measured from the first photospheric radius - expansion burst from the source , observed in 2014 june with _",
    "nustar _ @xcite .",
    "assuming that the degree of burst anisotropy @xmath60 does not change during radius expansion , and that the peak flux is achieved at touchdown ( when the expanding photosphere has returned to the neutron star surface ) , the expected flux would be ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath153 .",
    "this is well within the confidence interval of @xmath154 derived for the radius - expansion burst observed by @xcite . in the absence of a more detailed comparison with kepler simulations , which would allow us to incorporate the results from all three burst trains presented in table [ tab : bursts ] , we adopt the current value , but note that the true value may be lower"

    "<S> we have also estimated the recurrence time for pairs of bursts , including those observed during a transient outburst modelled using a numerical ignition code . for each pair of bursts we list the burst properties including recurrence time , fluence and peak flux , the persistent flux level ( and inferred accretion rate ) as well as the ratio of persistent flux to fluence . in the accompanying material we provide a bolometric lightcurve for each burst , determined from time - resolved spectral analysis . </S>",
