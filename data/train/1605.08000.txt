    "the study of global dynamics has long been of interest .",

    "interest in this has then extended to planar discrete dynamics .",
    "the case when the unique fixed point is a local saddle was addressed in @xcite for @xmath1 vector fields . however , the problem of characterising the existence of a global saddle for planar diffeomorphisms is still open .",
    "the presence of symmetry in a dynamical system creates special features that may be used to obtain global results .",
    "planar dynamics with symmetry , when the fixed point is either an attractor or a repellor , has been addressed by the authors in @xcite .",
    "there results , as well as those without extra assumptions on symmetry , ignore the important case when the fixed point is a local saddle .",
    "a local saddle for a map @xmath6 is a fixed point of @xmath7 , without loss of generality the origin , such that @xmath8 has eigenvalues @xmath9 , @xmath10 satisfying @xmath11 . when @xmath12 , the local saddle is called direct",
    "otherwise , it is called twisted .",
    "when we extend a local saddle globally , we ask for the local stable and unstable manifold to extend to infinity without homoclinic contacts .",
    "we stress that our concept of a global saddle is weaker than demanding that it be globally conjugated to a linear saddle .    in the present article",
    "we conclude the study of global discrete planar dynamics by looking at maps with a saddle at the origin , with results concerning maps both with and without symmetry .",
    "the non - symmetric case has been addressed by hirsch @xcite for direct saddles of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms such that every fixed point has a negative index .",
    "we obtain results for diffeomorphisms without period-2 points and include the case of twisted saddles .",
    "a simple example shows that our hypotheses are minimal .",
    "additionally , in the symmetric case , our results include fixed points of positive index .",
    "we also relax the diffeomorphism hypothesis to include homeomorphisms of class @xmath1 .",
    "when the symmetry group possesses two reflections , we show that the stable and unstable manifolds divide the plane in four connected components , that are either @xmath7-invariant or permuted by the dynamics .",

    "let @xmath292 be the poincar map associated to .",
    "by uniqueness of solutions , @xmath293 is well defined and injective . by continuous dependence on initial conditions",

    "since @xmath7 is bounded , @xmath46 continuous and periodic and @xmath250 verifies assumption ( a4 ) , all solutions of are defined in the future and in the past .",
    "consequently , @xmath293 is defined in @xmath98 and @xmath294 .",
    "thus , @xmath295 .",

    "hence @xmath293 has a fixed point .          since @xmath250 is monotonically decreasing and @xmath283 for all @xmath311 , then @xmath312 and @xmath313",
