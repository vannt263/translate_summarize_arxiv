    "consists in transition from a simplified quantum - mechanical description to the quantum field theory methods ( see e.g. review @xcite , more recent papers @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "mixing of fermion fields has some specifics as compared with boson case .",
    "firstly , there exists @xmath10-matrix structure in a propagator .",
    "secondly , fermion and antifermion have the opposite @xmath11-parity , so fermion propagator contains contributions of different parities . as a result , besides a standard mixing of fields with the same quantum numbers , for fermions there exists a mixing of fields with opposite parities ( opf - mixing ) , even if the parity is conserved in lagrangian .",
    "such a possibility for fermion mixing has been noted in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study this effect in detail and apply it to the baryon resonances production in @xmath3 reaction .",
    "in section 2 we consider a standard mixing of fermion fields of the same parity .",
    "following to @xcite we use the off - shell projection basis to solve the dyson  schwinger equation , it simplilies all manipulations with @xmath10-matrices and , moreover , clarifies the meaning of formulas .",
    "the use of this basis leads to separation of @xmath10-matrix structure , so in standard case we come to studying of a mixing matrix , which is very similar to boson mixing matrix .",
    "in section 3 we derive a general form of matrix dressed propagator with accounting of the opf - mixing .",
    "in contrast to standard case the obtained propagator contains @xmath12 terms , even if parity is conserved in vertexes .",
    "section 4 is devoted to more detailed studying of considered opf - mixing in application to production of resonances @xmath13 in @xmath3 scattering .",
    "first estimates demonstrates that the considered mixing generates marked effects in @xmath3 partial waves , changing a typical resonance curve .",
    "comparison of the obtained multichannel hadron amplitudes with @xmath14-matrix parameterization shows that our amplitudes may be considered as a specific variant of analytical @xmath14-matrix .",
    "in section 5 we consider opf - mixing for case of two vector - spinor rarita - schwinger fields @xmath15 , describing spin-@xmath16 particles , and apply the obtained hadron amplitudes for descriptions of @xmath3 partial waves @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
