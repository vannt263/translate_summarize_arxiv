    "type 1 and type 2 ( t1 and t2 respectively hereafter ) active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are defined by the presence or absence of broad emission lines in their spectra , respectively .",
    "when @xcite discovered the presence of hidden broad emission lines in the polarized spectra of t2 seyfert galaxies it was suggested that a dusty torus around the active nucleus was responsible for scattering the light , resulting in the so called  unified model of agn \" . in the most simple interpretation of agn unification , both t1 and t2 agn are expected to be the same type of object and only the orientation of a circumnuclear dusty torus differs relative to the observer @xcite . if the unified model is a complete description then all t2 agn should contain hidden broad lines .",
    "problematically for agn unification , these have only been discovered in approximately 50% of t2 agn @xcite .",
    "this suggests that at least some t2 agn are fundamentally different to t1 agn .",
    "however , the lack of hidden broad lines in all t2 agn might be solely explained by variable homogeneity and covering or obscuration factor of the dusty torus around the central engine @xcite .",
    "if the differences in observed properties of t1 and t2 agn are simply due to the orientation of the torus with respect to viewing angle , as predicted in the agn unification scheme , then there should be no significant difference between the external environment of these two types of agn .",
    "however , there have been observations that demonstrate that t1 and t2 seyfert galaxies ( sy1 and sy2 respectively hereafter ) are not found in identical environments .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have all found that sy2 galaxies are significantly more likely than sy1 galaxies to be in a galaxy pair with a projected separation of less than 100 kpc @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that sy2s reside in similar environments to galaxies in the iras bright galaxy sample @xcite whereas sy1s do not .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that this may imply an evolutionary path as a result of galaxy interactions from star - forming , to sy2 through to sy1 post interaction , and thus implying that agn unification is an inaccurate model .    as well as the simple likelihood of an agn to be of a particular type dependent upon the presence or absence of a nearby galaxy ,",
    "@xcite have conducted a thorough census of the properties of agn neighbours . by using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) seventh data release ( dr7 ; @xcite ) they found that in agn - agn pairs the neighbour of a t2 agn was significantly more likely to also be a t2 agn at projected separations below 200 kpc , further strengthening the validity of prior observations ( e.g , @xcite ) . further to this @xcite found that the colour of the neighbouring galaxies differed with agn type ; the neighbours of t1s being redder than the neighbours of t2s .",
    "this implies that either the star - formation rate , metallicity or stellar population age of the neighbouring galaxy may affect the type of agn triggered by the interaction .    as mergers are believed to be a primary source of fuel for agn @xcite , studying interacting galaxies where one galaxy hosts an agn provides an opportunity to investigate how nuclear activity evolves from its earliest stages .",
    "as interacting galaxies appear in the sky as close pairs , a major drawback facing some previous studies using projects such as the sdss ( e.g. , @xcite ) is the inability to detect the closest pairs of galaxies as a result of spectroscopic fibre collisions @xcite . in these situations , including the work by @xcite , photometric data is often used to support the spectroscopic observations .",
    "this can result in less accurate @xmath5-space separations of the pairs being measured and a lack of emission line data to classify potential agn .",
    "sdss dr7 @xcite contains about 1,050,000 galaxy spectra accounting for 94% of potential targets with the remainder being lost to fibre collisions @xcite .",
    "indeed , in dense regions of the sky , fibre collisions severely hamper the completeness of the sdss spectroscopic catalogue @xcite .",
    "surveys such as the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey @xcite circumvent the fibre collision problem by observing each field of view multiple times , moving the fibres between observations @xcite .",
    "this results in a far more complete sample of close pairs with which to study galaxy interactions than is possible in spectroscopic surveys that do not use this technique .",
    "indeed , the completeness of gama has already been used to better constrain the effect of close environment and galaxy interactions on galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "given the questions asked of agn in unification from observations over the last few decades , we aim to further scrutinise this widely accepted model by taking advantage of the high spectroscopic completeness of gama in order to thoroughly test the environment of broad and narrow line agn .",
    "furthermore , we investigate whether or not agn with a single broad balmer emission are indeed the same as agn with multiple broad balmer emission lines by comparing how these populations behave under a range of environmental probes .    in section [ s2 ] of this paper",
    "we describe the spectral emission line fitting method used to produce the data set from which we select our agn .",
    "section [ s3 ] outlines our method of selecting agn using the resultant emission line catalogue and details how we select galaxy pairs . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we analyse the environment of our agn and discuss our observations which we compare to other observations in section [ s_comp ] .",
    "our conclusions are stated in section [ s5 ] . throughout this paper",
    "we use a standard flat @xmath6cdm cosmology : @xmath7 .",
    "the gama survey was undertaken between 2008 and 2014 @xcite at the australian astronomical observatory ( aao ) using the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope .",
    "gama obtained spectra for @xmath8 galaxies with @xmath9 using the 2df / aaomega spectrograph @xcite . for each target",
    "the 2df / aaomega spectrograph obtains a blue spectrum covering the range 3750 - 5850  and a red spectrum covering 5650 - 8850 .",
    "these are spliced together at 5700  resulting in a total spectrum , which has a mean resolution of @xmath10 , with an observed wavelength range of 3750 - 8850  @xcite .",
    "covering @xmath11 square degrees across 5 regions ( g02 , g09 , g12 , g15 and g23 ) gama is @xmath12 complete in the 3 equatorial regions g09 , g12 and g15 @xcite making observations from these regions highly valuable for observing close pairs of galaxies .      to select our agn we require accurate emission line measurements for the spectra of the galaxies within gama .",
    "to this end we present and then use the speclinesfrv05 catalogue that provides line flux and equivalent width measurements for gama ii spectra by modelling emission lines with either a single or double gaussian profile .",
    "speclinesfrv05 is constructed by selecting the spectra in the gama specallv27 dataset that have a redshift quality @xmath13 ( indicating a redshift has been measured , for a full description of redshift quality in gama see @xcite ) and a redshift @xmath14 .",
    "the catalogue contains 427,829 entries and includes repeated measurements for some targets . in cases where objects have several spectra ,",
    "the best redshift was used for the line measurements .",
    "the catalogue excludes a small number of targets which either do not have spectra available , or were taken with the liverpool telescope @xcite .",
    "also excluded are additional spectra from the vvds ( vimos vlt deep survey ; @xcite )    this version of the resultant database is the first gama ii emission line measurements catalogue ( previous versions of the gama emission line measurement database have been for ; @xcite ) and differs from previous versions in that it also provides fits for spectra from sdss , the 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) , the 6 degree field galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ; @xcite ) , the wigglez survey @xcite , the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ; @xcite ) , the 2df - sdss lrg and qso survey ( 2slaq ; @xcite ) and the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ; @xcite ) . each spectrum is fitted across 5 regions containing 12 physically important emission lines . the continuum in each of these regions is modelled as a straight line .",
    "the fitting is done with the idl code ` mpfitfun ' @xcite which uses a levenberg - marquardt non - linear least squares minimisation to identify the best - fitting parameters for the model given the data and its associated uncertainties .",
    "the fitted spectral regions are :    * 3626 - 3779  to model the [ o ii ] lines at 3726  and 3729 .",

    "the resultant catalogue is organised into 3 data tables .",
    "the first table , speclinegaussfitsimple , contains line measurements derived from single - gaussian fits as well as the strength of the 4000  break , measured using the method of @xcite using the continuum band definitions given by @xcite .",

    "this is 12  blue - ward of the [ n ii](6548 ) line and is measured on the redshifted spectrum .",
    "the second table , speclinegaussfitcomplex , contains more complicated fits to the regions containing the h@xmath16 and h@xmath15 lines . for h@xmath16 and h@xmath15",
    ", a second gaussian component is added that may be either in absorption or broad emission .",
    "model selection scores are described below ( section [ s23 ] ) and can be used to select those spectra where this extra component is justified given the improvement in the fit due to the extra components .",
    "the third table , speclinedirectsummation , contains direct summation equivalent widths for 51 absorption and emission line species .",
    "the equivalent widths and their associated uncertainties are measured using the techniques outlined in @xcite .",
    "there are no corrections made due to the effects of velocity dispersion , nor are there attempts to place lick index measurements onto the lick system .",
    "the fitting begins with a simple straight line fit to the spectral region of interest ( listed above ) and increases in complexity depending on the line species .",
    "regions containing lines that are expected to only occur as narrow emission lines ( e.g. , [ o ii ] , [ s ii ] and [ o i ] ) have only one level of complexity above that of a straight line fit ( the inclusion of the gaussian lines for the narrow emission ) . for the regions containing h@xmath16 and h@xmath15 , there are six different manifestations of absorption and emission . for example , the region can contain the following combinations in increasing complexity ( likewise for h@xmath15 + [ o iii](4959/5007 ) :    * no emission or absorption , just continuum .",
    "* h@xmath16 in absorption and no [ n ii ] emission . * ( 6548 ) + h@xmath16 + [ n ii](6583 ) all with narrow emission . * ( 6548 ) + [ n ii](6583 ) in emission + h@xmath16 in absorption . * ( 6548 ) + [ n ii](6583 ) in emission + h@xmath16 in emission and absorption . * ( 6548 ) + [ n ii](6583 ) in emission + h@xmath16 in narrow plus broad emission .",
    "each of the above fits are performed on the data and a model selection score is given for the more complex model compared with the simpler one ( see below ) . for models with the same number of fitted parameters , the model with the lowest @xmath17 value is chosen .",

    "the score of 201 involving the the most complex model ` n_b to n ' of 201 indicates that this is this is the preferred fit ( see section [ s23 ] ) . ]    in order to fit the model to the line region the following limits are set :    * line position is limited to be within 200 km s@xmath18 of the expected position given the redshift of the galaxy ( the redshift has the heliocentric correction removed and sdss spectra are converted from vacuum to air wavelengths ) .",
    "* for the narrow emission line components , the width of the gaussian , @xmath19 , is constrained to be in the range @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the instrumental resolution of the spectrum in @xmath22 .",
    "this constrains the width of the narrow - line components to be less than @xmath23 . *",
    "the boundaries on the amplitude for the line are estimated from the range in data near the expected position of the line .",

    "this method provides equivalent width ( ew ) and flux ( f ) for the fitted lines and are derived by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the amplitude of the gaussian , @xmath19 is the line dispersion ( including instrument dispersion ) and @xmath28 is the continuum at the position of the emission line given by the equation of the linear fit to the continuum . the uncertainties on measurements are propagated in quadrature from the errors of their dependences .",
    "that is to say for @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "all the equivalent widths are corrected by @xmath31 and are thus rest - frame measurements .      given the increasing complexity of the models , it is important to ensure that the data are not being over - fit because of the extra freedom allowed by the additional model parameters .",
    "there are many model selection methods , each with its own advantages and drawbacks . in an attempt to overcome the drawbacks of different methods , three model selection methods",
    "have been used to give a single model selection score .",
    "two of the model selection methods have their roots in bayesian statistics and are estimators of the ` bayes factor ' .",
    "since a full bayesian approach would be rather time - consuming for  400,000 spectra , two analytic approximations are used to estimate the bayes factor .",
    "the first is the change in the bayesian information criterion ( @xmath32 ) , where the bic for each model is given by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of free parameters of the fit , @xmath35 is the number of data points and @xmath36 for models 1 and 2 .",
    "as can be seen , the bic strongly penalises models with additional parameters .",
    "the second bayes factor estimator is the laplacian approximation ( bf ) given by : @xmath37 @xmath38 is the marginal likelihood for model 1 , @xmath39 is the data , and @xmath40 is the parameter of model 1 . under the assumption that the probability distribution of @xmath41 has a well defined peak around the best - fitting parameters and the shapes of the distribution are approximately gaussian , laplace s approximation can be used @xcite to simplify the integrals to : @xmath42 @xmath43  is the number of free parameters in the model @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the covariance matrix for the best fitting model as determined by ` mpfitfun ' , and the prior @xmath46  is a uniform prior defined by the limits on parameters @xmath47",
    ".    models that have larger @xmath48 values are preferred . for this method",
    ", the addition of extra model parameters is strongly penalised by the @xmath49 term which , for uniform priors , drops significantly due to the additional volume probed by the parameter space in the more complicated model . the bayes factor and",
    "@xmath50 have the proportionality @xmath51 so the same criteria can be used to evaluate the strength of evidence of m1 vs m2 and vice - versa .",
    "the criteria are taken from @xcite and are cast in terms of comparing model m1 to m2 in table [ bayestab ] .    .using @xmath52 and @xmath32 to compare evidence in favour of model one over model 2 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ envks ]      the use of any neighbouring galaxy within @xmath53 and @xmath54 is somewhat liberal and is likely to include galaxies that are not truly interacting . to this end",
    "we take a subset of only those galaxy pairs that satisfy the more rigid criteria of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this is chosen to approximate the scale of the milky way - magellanic clouds interacting system @xcite , and thus contain only interacting galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the effect when only the closest neighbour of an agn is used in this analysis rather than all neighbours satisfying the pair criteria . we redo all our neighbour property analysis for this close pairs data and find no differences in any of the neighbour properties when the extended t1 agn are compared with the t2 agn . the bona fide t1s are not used in comparison with the t2s here due to low numbers .",
    "we find no difference between t1 and t2 agn when either of these pair criteria are used , using any of our neighbour property tests .",
    "of particular interest is the analysis when only pairs with @xmath57 and @xmath56 are considered .",
    "figure [ pairfracdr ] in @xcite shows that the fraction of galaxies that show signs of interaction in their morphologies increase as projected separation and , to a lesser extent , velocity difference decrease .",
    "those galaxies that have @xmath58 and @xmath59 are especially likely to show morphological disturbance .",
    "we show in section [ s41 ] that there may be an excess of t2s in pairs this close relative to the extended t1s and indeed the general galaxy population @xcite .",
    "we only have one bona fide t1 in a pair this close and as such do not compare the fraction of bona fide t1s to our other agn populations here . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have previously suggested a model whereby galaxy interactions trigger star - formation before narrow line nuclear activity is produced during the interaction , with broad line nuclear activity occurring later , post interaction .",
    "further still , the observations of @xcite show that closer projected separation is linked to an increase in obscured agn fraction , while @xcite and @xcite show an increased merger fraction in obscured agn .",
    "if agn are preferentially obscured by close interactions and mergers ( see in particular figure 10 of @xcite and section 5.2 of @xcite ) , then this could potentially be the result of a couple of different mechanisms .",
    "first , it may be the case that the either the gravitational effects of close interactions disturb the galaxy so as to disturb the morphology of the dust content of the torus and hence increase the chance of obscuration of an active nucleus .",
    "second , the increased accretion onto the black hole could draw more dust toward the central engine and hence increase both the covering factor and opacity of the obscurer .",
    "if our observations hold up with a larger observed population they may provide supporting evidence for such models .",
    "our observations are consistent with the the assumption that , being physically the same , t1 and t2 agn reside in similar environments . on the smallest observed scales ,",
    "our observations are consistent with the observations of @xcite in that they show a possible excess of t2s in very close pairs .",
    "such observations are viable within agn unification should mechanisms such as those described in section [ s4_pair_sep ] be invoked .",
    "the most puzzling aspect of our results is our inability to replicate the observations of @xcite with our data . in particular , we find no difference in the colours of the neighbouring galaxies .",
    "as such this inevitably raises questions as to whether or not our comparison with @xcite is a fair one , if ourselves and @xcite are segregating our agn in a similar manner , or if some other kind of selection effect may be biasing one of our results .      the strongest colour difference in the neighbours of t1 and t2 agn observed by @xcite occurs when the pair is separated by less than @xmath60 .",
    "as our comparison of the colour distributions takes into account pair separations up to @xmath61 it is logical to ask if our results change if we limit the analysis to sub @xmath60 pairs . for this separation",
    "we only have 20 neighbours with reliable observed colours to out bona fide t1 agn . as such",
    ", we only compare our extended t1 to our t2s in this test . given",
    "that @xcite select their t1 agn only on the presence of a broad h@xmath16 line , we consider this to be a fair comparison of our observations with those of @xcite .    for agn - galaxy pairs with @xmath55",
    "and we find mean @xmath62 colours of the neighbours of the extended t1 and t2 agn to be @xmath63 and @xmath64 mag respectively .",
    "if we limit our selected agn to only those with , the mean neighbour colours are @xmath65 for the extended t1s and @xmath66 for the t2s .",
    "the errors are estimated using the standard error of the mean . given the scale of our errors , compared to the scale of the difference in colour observed by @xcite ( @xmath67 in their spectroscopic sample , rising to @xmath68 in their photometric sample ) , then we would expect to see a similar colour difference in our sample should one exist .",
    "furthermore , the ks derived @xmath69-values for the colour distributions of the neighbouring galaxies of the extended t1 and the t2 agn being statistically similar to be 0.989 and 0.910 for all agn of all luminosities and @xmath70}}<42.0\\,\\text{erg}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ ] respectively .",
    "that is to say , when we observe the pairs where @xcite found the strongest difference in colour between the neighbours of t1 and t2 agn , we find no such difference .",
    "@xcite select their t1 agn based solely on having a broad h@xmath16 line , defined in their paper as @xmath71 , based on the fit of a single gaussian to the emission line . in the case of a broad emission line this may inaccurately model the shape of the emission line and hence provide inaccurate measurements on properties such as equivalent width .",
    "further to this , the selection of t1 agn based solely on h@xmath16 likely includes partially obscured agn ( similar to our extended t1 selection ) .",
    "as we have shown , at least for our data , the partially obscured agn population behaves similarly to the unobscured population ( our bona fide t1 selection ) . as such",
    "we do not expect that this is the cause of the discrepancy between our observations .",
    "there are also differences in how we select our t2 agn .",
    "more specifically , like @xcite we use @xcite to select our t2s .",
    "this is a conservative measure of nuclear activity and excludes composite star - forming galaxies with agn component as well as some liners .",
    "however , in order to ensure the fidelity of our t2 sample , we further to this exclude as a liner any galaxy that satisfies equation [ linereq ] .",
    "@xcite describe their method of selecting t2s in section 1.1.3 of the supplementary information of their paper , and how they remove liners in section 1.1.1 . as they use the @xcite criteria to select their t2s .",
    "consequently , their t2 population may be more complete than ours , but may suffer from contamination by star - forming and composite sf - agn galaxies .",
    "further to this our exclusion of liners appears to be done using a different methodology . as such , it may the case that @xcite and ourselves have t2 samples that are not drawn from the same parent population",
    "in this work we have analysed the environment of 954 spectroscopically - selected agn from the gama ii galaxy survey @xcite . exploiting the high spectroscopic completeness of gama @xcite",
    "allows us to test recent observations suggesting different types of agn reside in differing environments @xcite .",
    "thus , using gama we are able to comprehensively question the validity of the simple agn unification scheme proposed by @xcite .",
    "having compared the fraction of t1 and t2 agn found in pairs we find no significant differences , contrasting with previous works @xcite .",
    "this similarity in environment is maintained when our agn - galaxy pairs are binned by projected separation and agn",
    "[ o iii](5007 ) luminosity .",
    "taking the case of the simple agn unification scheme , should orientation of the agn relative to our line of sight be the only difference between t1 and 2 agn , and should this orientation be approximately random , then one would expect to see no differences in the pair fraction of agn by type . furthermore , we observe no significant difference in the neighbours of agn of different types .",
    "the @xmath62 , @xmath72 , stellar masses , sfrs and ssfrs of the neighbouring galaxies all have similar distributions , confirmed by ks testing , with agn type .",
    "ergo , our observations here support the agn unification model .    the one environmental difference we do note with agn type occurs in galaxy pairs separated by less than @xmath73 in projection .",
    "we find an excess of t2s in sub @xmath74 pairs relative to the extended t1 and general galaxy population in such close pairs .",
    "one possible explanation for this could be that the simple agn unification model holds except in the case of close gravitational interactions , where the geometry of the dust distribution in the galaxy is disrupted such that the likelihood of obscuration is increased .",
    "alternatively , it may be that the interaction between galaxies drives more dust toward the nuclear region and it is this way that the probability of obscuration is increased . in summary ,",
    "our main findings are :    * the fraction of agn found in pairs does not vary significantly with agn type or pair separation down to @xmath75 . at separations of @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    "there appears to be an excess of t2 agn but more data will be required to confirm this . *",
    "the @xmath62 colour of the inactive neighbouring galaxies of agn in pairs of galaxies does not appear to change depending on whether the agn is of the broad or narrow line variety in contrast with @xcite .",
    "the same result is found for the @xmath72 colours of the neighbouring galaxies to the agn . *",
    "we find no difference in either the sfr or ssfr among the neighbouring galaxies of t1 and 2 agn .",
    "we also find no difference in the fraction of these neighbours that are classed as star - forming according to a bpt diagram .",
    "* comparing the distances to the 5th nearest neighbour of our agn fails to find a difference between our broad and narrow line agn populations .",
    "* our results are generally consistent with the unified model of agn proposed by @xcite and further still support the observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the major hinderance to our observations has been our small sample size .",
    "gama ii is highly complete allowing for spectroscopic observations of very close pairs of interacting galaxies .",
    "however , the survey footprint in the 3 equatorial regions ( g09 , g12 , g15 ) is limited to @xmath78 square degrees .",
    "the small survey volume limits our ability to make statistically significant claims for well - matched agn subsets , e.g. , very close pairs with agn of similar luminosity .",
    "therefore , we state that although most of our results are consistent with agn unification , the apparent excess in t2s in very close pairs with @xmath58 and @xmath79 suggest that agn unification may not be a complete model .",
    "the question of agn unification is thus likely to remain an open one for the foreseeable future .    to answer this",
    "will likely require a spectroscopically complete survey with a larger volume to provide a statistically robust complete spectroscopic analysis of agn environment .",
    "such a dataset may be available within the next few years from taipan ( transforming astronomical imaging surveys through the polychromatic analysis of nebula )",
