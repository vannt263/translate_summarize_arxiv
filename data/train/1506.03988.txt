    "the physics of driven quantum systems , as an attractive topic in quantum physics , has been widely studied for several decades  @xcite . at present , the study of such systems is significant for quantum information processing  @xcite and renewed in the context of artificial atoms such as superconducting circuits  @xcite .",
    "the prototype of driven quantum systems is the rabi model describing a two - level system ( tls ) driven by a harmonic driving ( we set @xmath0 ) , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the usual pauli matrix and @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the transition frequency of the tls . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the amplitude and frequency of the harmonic driving , respectively .",
    "usually , one invokes the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , i.e. the omission of the counter - rotating ( cr ) terms @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the rwa is valid in the weak driving and resonance cases , but breaks down in the strong driving regimes  [ 2 ] .",
    "it has been recognized that the cr terms lead to the shift of resonance position and additional beats in the time evolution  @xcite .",
    "particularly , the shift of resonance position from resonance frequency of the rwa case is called the bloch - siegert ( bs ) shift : @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the bs shift in the present work .",
    "the bs shift has been considered extensively in the cases of both classical and quantized fields  @xcite . for the classical field , it is convenient to give the bs shift by the floquet formalism developed by shirley  @xcite . for the quantized field ,",
    "a fully quantum mechanical description was provided in the so - called dressed - atom model that combines the atom and driving field  @xcite .",
    "all in all , most of pervious works , which are based on perturbation calculation , give the well - known bs shift in @xmath9th order of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "hence , there is not yet a simple analytical method to produce the bs shift in the entire range of the driving strength .",
    "apart from the theoretical calculation of the bs shift , the effect of the bs shift has been studied before , such as an asymmetric autler - townes profile in a driven three - level system  @xcite , the shift of the sidebands of resonance fluorescence  @xcite , application to the astrophysical determination of the fundamental constants variation  @xcite , etc .",
    "more recently , we showed that the bs - type correction plays an important role in the relaxation and dephasing processes  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the bs shift has also been experimentally observed in strongly driven artificial atoms  @xcite .    in this paper , we calculate the bs shift over the entire driving - strength regime ( @xmath10 ) by a simple analytical method based on a unitary transformation  @xcite .",
    "the approach has been used to study the driven tunneling dynamics of the tls in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that our method provides almost the same description as the numerically exact treatment over a wide parameter regime of interest .",
    "moreover , we prove that the bs shift up to the @xmath11th order in @xmath5 given by our method is the same as that obtained by the floquet approach  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we show that both small and large bs shifts can be uniformly and correctly evaluated from the derivative of effective rabi frequency we derived , in comparison with numerically exact results and previous analytical results .",
    "moreover , we illustrate that the signatures of the bs shift can be monitored in the emission process and probe - pump spectrum under the experiment accessible conditions . when @xmath12 , we show that the sidebands of the non - rwa probe - pump spectrum are generally asymmetric .",
    "the asymmetry results from the bs shift and can be enhanced with increasing the driving strength . on the other hand , the non - rwa probe - pump spectra",
    "become symmetric only when @xmath13 .",
    "according to these properties , one may check the signatures of the bs shift experimentally .",
    "the wave function @xmath14 of the tls satisfies schrdinger equation @xmath15|\\psi(t)\\rangle=0.\\ ] ] we transform the above equation as follows : @xmath16[e^{-s(t)}e^{s(t)}|\\psi(t)\\rangle]\\equiv \\left[h^\\prime(t)-i\\frac{d}{dt}\\right]|\\psi^\\prime(t)\\rangle=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 here , we give the time - dependent generator @xmath19 of the transformation @xmath20 with parameter @xmath21 $ ] to be determined later  @xcite .",

    ", the treatment is exact . to proceed",
    ", we neglect the part @xmath30 since the higher - order harmonic terms with the higher - order bessel functions are reasonably negligible over a wide range of parameters space  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we arrive at the hamiltonian @xmath31 .",
    "we verify that this treatment is beyond perturbation by the correct prediction of the bs shift for @xmath32 .    to proceed , we determine @xmath33 by @xmath34    consequently , we rewrite the hamiltonian @xmath35 as @xmath36 this is the counter - rotating hybridized rotating wave ( chrw ) hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "note that the chrw hamiltonian possesses a rwa - like form with a renormalized transition frequency @xmath37 and a renormalized driving strength @xmath38 .",
    "the renormalized quantities in the transformed hamiltonian results explicitly from the effects of cr interactions @xcite .",
    "we apply a rotating operation @xmath39 to the hamiltonian ( [ hprime ] ) , and get @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the effective detuning .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath42 can be readily diagonalized .",

    "we calculate the bs shift by using the effective rabi frequency obtained in the former section .",
    "the bs shift measures the deviation of resonance frequency @xmath49 of the original hamiltonian from that of the rwa : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the resonance frequency of the rwa case . in general",

    "on solving the equation @xmath54 for driving frequency @xmath6 , we determine the position of the resonant transitions .",

    "similar to shirley s method , the resonance condition in our formalism is @xmath56 since @xmath53 is related to @xmath57 by the relation @xmath58 . by solving the equation for variable @xmath6 , we get the resonance frequency @xmath59 .",

    "the obtained @xmath6 is actually the desired resonance frequency @xmath49 of the rabi hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward to obtain the bs shift by eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) . on one hand , in the weak driving case",
    ", we have correctly given the power series expansion of the bs shift in the previous work  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is easy to solve a large bs shift in the strong - driving limit . when @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . thus , the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : drabi ] ) for @xmath6 is determined by @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the first zero of @xmath68 gives the resonance frequency in the strong - driving limit , @xmath69 this result is the same as that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an interesting phenomena , coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) , occurs at @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we immediately recognize that the cdt condition coincides with the resonance condition eq.([eq : asym ] ) .",
    "hence , it means that the cdt is actually a resonantly - driven phenomenon . in other words",
    ", it indicates that the large bs shift plays important role in this unique phenomenon .      in order to illustrate the validity of our method and the accuracy of the calculated bs shift , we compare our results with the numerically exact and previous analytical results given by the methods based on floquet theory .",
    "we show the approach of calculating the exact numerical bs shift by floquet formalism . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the derivative @xmath71 can be evaluated from the eigenstates of the floquet hamiltonian @xmath72 where the notations are the same as shirley s ( the index @xmath73 represents states of the tls and @xmath74 denotes integer representing fourier component .",

( [ shirleyqw ] )",
    "we can numerically obtain the value of derivative @xmath78 with the fixed @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "we introduce two approximate methods for comparison by the analytical result of the @xmath81 obtained by shirley  @xcite .",

    "therefore , the probe - pump spectrum provides a way to sense the roles of the bs shift by two properties : ( i ) for @xmath12 , the lineshape of the spectrum changes from nearly symmetric to asymmetric as @xmath5 increases , while that of the rwa are always symmetric ; ( ii ) the non - rwa lineshape becomes symmetric only under the exact - resonance condition , i.e. @xmath160 .",
    "one expects that the two properties can be checked in superconducting - circuit qubits under the moderately strong driving field .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the bs shift over the entire driving - strength range using the derivative of the effective rabi frequency and demonstrated detectable signatures induced by the bs shift .",
    "it turned out that our method can be correctly applied to study the small shift case when the driving strength is moderately weak , but also accurately solve the large shift case when the driving strength is sufficiently strong , which is beyond the perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , our method allows us to examine the role of the bs shift in the emission and absorption processes from the open driven tls .",
    "we showed that it is easy to obtain the time evolution of excited - state population of the tls as well as its steady - state behavior , which indicates the emergence of resonance .",
    "we illustrated that the time - averaged population of tls provides a direct measurement of the bs shift , which is consistent with previous work .",
    "furthermore , we found that in experiment accessible parameters regimes , the non - rwa spectrum becomes symmetric only for @xmath13 , i.e. for the resonance condition correctly taken into account the bs shift .",
    "otherwise , the lineshape of the spectrum is generally asymmetric .",
    "while for @xmath12 , the non - rwa spectrum becomes asymmetric with the increase of the driving strength , while the rwa spectrum is always symmetric .",
