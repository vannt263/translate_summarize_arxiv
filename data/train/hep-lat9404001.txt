    "the 3 non - linear @xmath4-model in @xmath5 space - time dimensions has been much studied because of the properties it shares with 4-dimensional non - abelian gauge theories : it is asymptotically free , becomes non - perturbative in the infra - red regime and has a non - trivial topology due to the homotopy class of windings from @xmath6 .",
    "it has been known for some time that the standard lattice discretisation of the 3 model has problems  for example , the lattice topological susceptibility does not obey nave scaling laws .",
    "lscher has shown  @xcite that this is due to the model being dominated by short - range fluctuations .",
    "formulating this theory on the lattice implies a minimum size to these fluctuations , and so the important contributions from fluctuations smaller than one lattice spacing are absent .",
    "there is also the problem that additional short - range fluctuations ( known as lattice artefacts ) are present in the lattice formulation and not in the continuum .",
    "these are unphysical field configurations such as the winding of the field around one plaquette , giving rise to spurious contributions to the topological charge  @xcite .",
    "the model is well understood in some respects  for instance an exact expression for the mass gap is known  @xcite .",
    "it is thus a natural candidate for a theory which one can attempt to understand in terms of the vacuum structure . in this paper",
    "we explore the nature of the vacuum via numerical simulation in euclidean time .",
    "we concentrate on large scale structures in the vacuum - such as those arising from instantons . in order to focus on such extended features in the vacuum",
    ", we use a procedure to smooth out local fluctuations .",
    "a cooling algorithm is used to achieve this .",
    "the basic idea is that a local smoothing of the fields should preserve long range features such as instantons . in  @xcite we explored this by varying the details of the cooling procedure and presenting qualitative features of the resulting topological charge distribution .    in this work",
    "we wish to make a quantitative study of the nature of the topological distribution in the vacuum .",
    "such a cooling procedure will modify the short distance properties of the vacuum , so we explore the distribution of the size of topological objects since we can expect that the large size objects are unchanged under cooling . by varying the lattice spacing and the extent of cooling , we are able to present results for the physical distribution of large scale topological fluctuations .",
    "the continuum @xmath0 3 euclidean action @xmath7 is defined as : @xmath8 with @xmath9 an 3 vector and the constraint @xmath10 .",
    "much use has been made of so - called `` improved '' actions in 3 ( eg  @xcite ) and more recently `` over - improved ''  @xcite and `` perfect''@xcite lattice actions have been proposed ; here we use the more local nearest - neighbour action .",
    "this is appropriate since we wish to develop techniques that will extend to other theories ( such as 4-dimensional @xmath11 ) where a perfect lattice action is not yet available . taking the discrete form of the derivative ( @xmath12 running over the space - time directions ) :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is now a field associated with the site @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "is the lattice spacing ( hereafter set to 1 ) , the lattice action is : @xmath17 with the index @xmath12 again running over directions on the lattice , and @xmath18 defined as the sum over nearest neighbours : @xmath19    the continuum topological charge @xmath20 is defined as : @xmath21 and is by definition an integer . however",
    ", if this `` field theoretical '' definition is placed navely onto the lattice , it returns non - integer values and acquires a renormalisation factor  @xcite .",
    "there are other `` geometric '' lattice definitions that return integers , one example being given in  @xcite , based on the mapping @xmath6 , by calculating the signed area of the spherical triangles formed by the @xmath9 fields around a plaquette .",
    "the contribution to the total charge from a site @xmath22 on the dual lattice is given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the area of the spherical triangle on the unit sphere mapped out by the @xmath9 fields , and the subscripts @xmath26 refer to the corners of a plaquette labelled anti - clockwise .",
    "clearly there are two ways to triangulate a plaquette and the difference in the contribution to @xmath27 from the two triangulations is @xmath28 for configurations with small action , but can be @xmath29 for other field configurations .",
    "there are arguments against the use of such a charge definition , particularly in calculations of the topological susceptibility , @xmath30 , in @xmath31 theories with small values of @xmath32 .",
    "campostrini et al have shown  @xcite that for values of @xmath33 and larger , the geometrical formulation gives a sensible definition of @xmath30 , but not for lower values of @xmath32 .",
    "since we shall wish to compare fluctuations in the topological charge density with instantons , we now discuss the details of the instanton contributions .",
    "let us first summarise the results for the continuum in an infinite space - time region .    with @xmath9 written in terms of the projective fields @xmath34 , @xmath35 : @xmath36 ( 13 here are 3 indices ) a field configuration _ representing _ a single ( continuum ) instanton of size @xmath37 at position @xmath38 can be explicitly constructed via  @xcite @xmath39 with @xmath40 the coordinate in the complex plane .",
    "this can be easily extended to generate multiple instanton configurations ; an @xmath32-instanton configuration has the form : @xmath41 and has topological charge @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , a multi  anti - instanton configuration with @xmath42 can be generated via  @xcite : @xmath43 it should be noted that a configuration containing both instantons and anti - instantons is not strictly a solution of the classical equations of motion . in  @xcite , bukhvostov and lipatov",
    "construct a general configuration containing @xmath44 instantons and @xmath45 anti - instantons via @xmath46 based on the assumption that the instantons have sizes small compared to their separations , @xmath47 , or essentially different scales , e.g. @xmath48 , i.e. on the assumption that the instantons and anti - instantons are weakly interacting . in this scenario ,",
    "the 3 model becomes equivalent to an exactly soluble fermion model .",
    "with @xmath9 and @xmath34 as in eqs .",
    "[ e : phi ] and  [ e : oneinst ] above , the action and topological charge density become : @xmath49 where here the size parameter @xmath50 is an abbreviation for @xmath37 of eq .",
    "[ e : oneinst ] .",
    "a similar relation holds true for multi - instanton configurations .",
    "it should be noted that , for a general field configuration , the action density is positive definite , but the charge density is not , having contributions from both instantons and anti - instantons for which the charge has opposite signs .",
    "the topological charge sets a lower bound on the action  @xcite : @xmath51 from which it can be deduced that a single instanton configuration has action @xmath52 : @xmath53 clearly an @xmath32-instanton configuration generated from eq .",
    "[ e : multinst ] will have an action @xmath54 .    on a space with toroidal boundary conditions ,",
    "there are _ no _ exact single - instanton solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "an argument for this is given in  [ a : torus ] .",
    "the simplest solution has two instantons with their @xmath50 parameters satisfying @xmath55 . for solutions with several instantons and anti - instantons ,",
    "the constraints from the toroidal boundary conditions will be relatively less severe .",
    "on the lattice the boundary conditions are toroidal , so the one instanton configuration based on eq .",
    "[ e : oneinst ] will be only a metastable field configuration .",
    "furthermore , the lattice action differs from the continuum action to order @xmath16 where @xmath16 is the lattice spacing .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , this implies that instantons are not exact solutions to the lattice equations of motion .",
    "for the conventional lattice action ( as used here ) this results in instantons shrinking slowly under application of the equations of motion .",
    "if a dilute gas of instantons and anti - instantons is a good approximation , it is possible to deduce the nature of their size distribution from renormalisation group arguments ",
    "see  @xcite . for the 3 model",
    "this approximation gives @xmath56 where the 4 powers of @xmath57 come from scale and translation considerations , and the 3 powers of @xmath58 in the integrand come from dimensional analysis .",
    "@xmath59 is the function we wish to determine and @xmath60 the cutoff mass .",
    "@xmath61 is dimensionless , and as the only dimensionful quantities are @xmath50 and @xmath60 , then we should replace the bare coupling @xmath61 by the running coupling @xmath62 .",
    "renormalisation group theory implies that for any observable quantity , @xmath63 and @xmath64 should enter only in the combination @xmath65 with @xmath66 obtainable from the one - loop @xmath67-function .",
    "the form of @xmath59 and hence the distribution by size can therefore be deduced . for 3 , @xmath68  @xcite , ( see also  @xcite ) and gives a factor of @xmath69 , implying @xmath70 to accomodate this , and giving a distribution that goes as the reciprocal of the instanton size .",
    "this explains why it is so difficult to determine the topological charge on a lattice since the distribution is peaked at small size where the lattice modifies the behaviour substantially .",
    "however , the large size component of the distribution should be amenable to study on a lattice and that is the topic we now address .",
    "we use lattices of size @xmath71 with 1000 sweeps between configurations . each sweep is composed of 1 heatbath and 9 over - relaxed updates of the whole lattice . the action density distribution on a lattice configuration at @xmath72 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : uncooled ] . as we found previously  @xcite , it is not feasible to derive any useful results from such configurations since they have too much short distance fluctuation .",
    "they first need to be cooled .",
    "cooling , being a local update algorithm , removes the short - range noise and leaves the longer - range instantons approximately alone  @xcite .",
    "our lattice action has order @xmath16 effects that imply  @xcite that an instanton - like solution has an action close to the continuum value given in eq .",
    "[ e : instact ] but which is reduced slightly as the size @xmath50 decreases .",
    "thus cooling , which is equivalent to iteratively implementing the equations of motions , will affect the size of an instanton .",
    "protracted cooling on a single , moderately sized instanton gradually reduces its size to that of one lattice spacing , and then destroys it .",
    "this is familiar from the plateaux that develop in the action as a configuration is cooled .",
    "the plateaux correspond to instantons being shrunk then destroyed .",
    "the contribution to the action from an instanton is a finite amount which depends only weakly on the instanton s size , so the action will decrease by approximately @xmath73 each time an instanton is destroyed . in order to analyse instanton - like features after cooling",
    ", we have to calibrate the cooling process to take account of such shrinkage under cooling .",
    "the cooling we used was an under - relaxed cooling : @xmath74 properly normalised so that @xmath75 , with @xmath76 defined in eq .",
    "[ e : phif ] .",
    "@xmath77 is a parameter which determines the severity of the cooling .",
    "the effects of varying @xmath77 are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we wish to study the nature of the topological charge distribution , in particular the frequency of occurrence of large objects .",
    "we assume that large scale objects will have a shape similar to that of an idealised instanton .",
    "this is based on the expectation that meta - stable solutions to the classical equations of motion will dominate the quantum vacuum , so our strategy is to analyse the topography of the cooled vacuum distribution to report on its nature .    if the action after cooling is @xmath78 , then we expect to have of order @xmath79 topological objects present",
    ". the topological charge distribution @xmath80 can have either sign and so contains more information in principle than the action density @xmath81 . since , however , @xmath82 closely tracks @xmath81 after cooling  @xcite  see fig .",
    "[ f : sandq]it is sufficient to use @xmath78 alone .",
    "this has two advantages : it is easier to calculate numerically ( particularly in more complex theories than 3 ) and it enables us to select regions in a way unbiased by sign so that any correlation between the distribution of instantons and anti - instantons can be studied .",
    "a further advantage is that from @xmath81 it is relatively easy to devise a robust algorithm that finds @xmath32 connected space - time regions .    for each cooled configuration , we select @xmath32 connected regions such that each region contains an internal local maximum of the action density and is composed of all connected sites with an action density greater than half that maximum .",
    "the regions are mutually exclusive and we select them in order of decreasing value of their maximum action density . the square root of the area of each such region was then taken to parametrise the actual `` size '' @xmath50 of the region .    in order to calibrate this algorithm , we first analysed artificial configurations created with one instanton generated by eqs .",
    "[ e : phi ] and  [ e : oneinst ] .",
    "a linear relation was found between our calculated size and the input size .",
    "returning now to real configurations , we looked at the relation between the value of the action density at the local maximum and the size assigned to it , as eq .",
    "[ e : sandq ] implies , for isolated continuum instantons : @xmath83    we compared the data from our configurations with this predicted continuum behaviour ; the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : handw ] .",
    "while it is clear that our data do _ not _ have the exact inverse - square behaviour , it is nonetheless encouraging to see that the data lie near to the curve .",
    "indeed , any dissimilarity between the curve and the data can be seen as further evidence that the dilute instanton gas is not the correct model for the vacuum .",
    "since cooling tends to shrink instantons , it is important to calibrate the amount of cooling used and the extent of this effect .",
    "this is particularly important since we wish to decrease the lattice spacing and obtain results for the continuum limit .",
    "our cooling algorithm is local ( ie . on the scale of 1 lattice spacing ) and so will need to be adjusted to have the same physical effect as the lattice spacing is reduced .",
    "we would hope that cooling can be arranged to have the same effect in physical distance units .",
    "this may not be possible because though the cooling may be adjusted to have similar effects at a given short distance ( in physical units ) , it may give different effects at a larger distance as the lattice spacing is varied .    in order to mimimise such problems ,",
    "we specify the cooling in terms of its effect on an instanton . thus we cool until an isolated instanton of a given physical size is removed ( ie shrunk to zero ) . indeed in  @xcite , we determined the amount of cooling to use by computing the number of steps required , at a given @xmath77 , to remove a single instanton of a given size generated via eq .",
    "[ e : oneinst ] .",
    "here we specify the instanton size in physical units , i.e. in units of the correlation length @xmath84 .",
    "we considered the cooling required to remove such instantons of size one third , one half and two thirds the correlation length , and the results are given in table  [ t : mass ] .",
    ".[t : mass ] the measured mass gap and lattice sizes at the three values of @xmath61 we used , and the number of cooling sweeps required , at @xmath85 to remove an instanton of size @xmath86 at each value of @xmath61 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we compare our method of analysis of the large scale topological objects with that used by other workers . in",
    "@xcite the size of 2 instantons was estimated by calculating the topological charge density correlation function @xmath87 with the sum over the whole lattice .",
    "then @xmath88 is fitted for each instanton at a particular value of @xmath50 using a convolution of an analytic continuum expression similar to eq .",
    "[ e : sandq ] : @xmath89    elsewhere , in  @xcite , 2 instanton size data are obtained from two methods : first a simple extraction of a size from the continuum single - instanton relation @xmath90 and a second method which measured the extent of the instanton only in the lattice axis directions , and then took the average of these numbers as the size .",
    "different methods can give different results , particurarly for 3 , since the vacuum is not well approximated by a dilute gas of instantons .",
    "we believe that our method of assigning `` instantons '' is more robust and works well even if the instantons are not well - separated .",
    "our method works for moderately cooled configurations and does not rely upon the configurations having been cooled to such an extent that they are no longer representative of the pre - cooled physics .",
    "furthermore , the methods used in  @xcite rely explicitly on the instantons having a circular geometry , just as those generated by eq .  [ e : oneinst ] do ; it is clear from fig .",
    "[ f : sandq ] , and from the results shown in  @xcite , that , in 3 at least , artificially generated isolated instantons are not representative of those obtained from a simulation of the vacuum .",
    "in this paper we have extended the work begun in  @xcite , and shown that it is possible to obtain a distribution of large size topological objects that is , within some size range , independent of the cooling performed .",
    "we have put forward the criterion for an optimum cooling to be such that objects of size @xmath91 , ie twice the lattice spacing be removed by the cooling process . at our values of @xmath61",
    ", this corresponds to objects with size of the order of half the correlation length be removed .",
    "furthermore , we find results that can be interpreted as applicable to the continuum distribution , as they are independent over a range of lattice spacing varying by a factor of two .",
    "we confirm , by non - perturbative study , that the distribution of size of topological objects is peaked at small size .",
    "roughly our results are that @xmath92 ( with @xmath79 ) .",
    "this contrasts with the inverse size distribution expected for a dilute gas of instantons .",
    "we have also shown , in figs .",
    "[ f : sandq ] and  [ f : handw ] , that the dilute instanton gas is not a good model for the 3 vacuum at the values of @xmath61 we used , and made a preliminary study of the relative distributions of instanton and anti - instanton separations , and found them to be correlated to the extent that unlike pairs exist at smaller separations that like pairs of objects .",
    "in this appendix we present an argument that it is not possible to place a single instanton on a torus .        if we now take a rectangular region , @xmath98 , of @xmath99 and impose toroidal boundary conditions , then ( @xmath100 denoting the boundary of @xmath98 ) @xmath101 as there is a pairwise cancellation of the line integral along opposite sides of @xmath98 .",
    "cauchy s theorem then implies that @xmath102 and thus that one can not have a single - instanton solution to the equations of motion on a torus ( as its residue would be identically zero ) but multi - instanton solutions are possible . as shown in  @xcite , a periodic solution of eq .",
    "[ e : eqmotion ] on @xmath98 can be expressed in terms of the weierstrass @xmath1 function .",
