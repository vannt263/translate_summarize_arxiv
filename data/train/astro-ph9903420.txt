    "a large portion of galactic dynamics is the study of the relationship between mass and motion in and around galaxies .",
    "the total gravitational potential of galaxies  its extent , radial density profile , flattening , and trixiality  strongly affects the motions and morphology of associated stellar and gaseous components , and thus subjects as varied as merging rates , the evolution of galactic disks , bars , warps and spiral structure , the tully - fisher and fundamental plane relations , and the nature of the presumed galactic dark matter constituents .    to the extent that the strength of the gravitational potential of galaxies is provided by unseen dark matter",
    " rather than by poorly characterized luminous mass or a modification to the law of gravitation ( mcgaugh 1999 , and references therein )  the morphology and motion of luminous galactic tracers can be used to deduce the form of the underlying dark mass distribution , provided that the relationship linking them is sufficiently well understood .",
    "each luminous tracer has its own advantages and disadvantages for this purpose ; many are suitable only for galaxies of a given type or within a given galactocentric radius .",
    "several observational techniques and the results that they have produced regarding dark halo shape are reviewed here , with emphasis on the strengths and weakness of each .",
    "many of the results are model - dependent ; some are in apparent conflict with others . in this brief and necessarily incomplete review",
    ", it will not be possible to do justice to the complexity and richness of the scientific dialogue on these issues or to resolve apparent discrepancies . instead",
    ", emphasis will be placed on the assumptions and possible systematic effects inherent to various techniques , and on the areas of general agreement and controversy between them",
    ". the focus will be on spirals rather than early type galaxies , in part because the shape of dark halos is ( generally ) better constrained in disk galaxies but also because the situation with respect to ellipticals is reviewed elsewhere in this proceedings ( bridges 1999 ) .",
    "for other reviews on the shape of dark halos , see rix ( 1996 ) and sackett ( 1996 ) .",
    "the shape of the dark halo is determined by its radial profile and  to the extent that it can be described as triaxial  the axis ratios @xmath8 ( intermediate - to - long ) and @xmath9 ( short - to - long ) .",
    "as we shall see , most all observational studies indicate that , in the region where they can be probed , dark halos are only mildly triaxial and oblate ( @xmath10 ) , with the equatorial plane of the dark halo nearly coinciding with that of the stellar body . throughout this review , we will characterize the geometric form of the dark halo by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the axis ratios of _ density _ , not potential .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath11 to which any density @xmath12 gives rise will in general be more spherical ; a rough rule of thumb is @xmath13~~.\\ ] ]    to first approximation , closed loop orbits of a tracer population will have the same ellipticity as the underlying potential , but their long axis will be perpendicular to that of @xmath11 .    in the most general case , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which describe the ovalness and flattening of the dark density respectively , may be functions of radius . at a given radius ,",
    "the shape of the total gravitational potential may differ from that due to the dark halo alone , depending on the relative shape and strength of the luminous and dark contributions to the total @xmath11 at that position .",
    "the mass of the halo within a given enclosed radius depends strongly on the form of its radial density profile @xmath14 .",
    "the inner radial profile of the dark halo affects the dynamic interplay between dark matter and mature stellar systems , while the outer profile influences the dynamics of the galaxy - satellite system and its interaction with its nearest neighbors .",
    "the quality of galactic rotation curves allows the accurate determination of the total ( luminous + dark ) mass enclosed within a radius equal to one - half the maximum extent @xmath15 of the velocity tracer ( sackett 1997 ) . if the isodensity contours of total mass are not concentric ellipsoids , as they are unlikely to be when composed of several components of differing shape , uncertainties in the extrapolation of the outer rotation curve translate into uncertainties in the inferred enclosed mass beyond @xmath15 .",
    "interior to @xmath15 , uncertainty in the _ dark _ density profile @xmath14 is not due to uncertainty in dark halo geometry or inadequate velocity data , but to the uncertain mass - to - light ratio @xmath16 of the luminous component and thus the contribution of the luminous mass to the inner rotation support of the galaxy .",
    "the `` maximum disk hypothesis , '' which assumes that the mass of the stellar disk alone ( possibly in conjunction with a stellar bulge ) is responsible for the inner rotation speed of spirals , was first formulated in order to place a conservative lower limit on the amount of dark matter deduced from rotation curves ( van  albada & sancisi 1986 ) . since then , evidence both for and against the suitability of the hypothesis as a description of the actual distribution of stellar mass in the interiors of bright",
    ", high surface - brightness spirals has been put forward ( e.g. , palunas & williams 1999 ; courteau & rix 1999 , sellwood 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "mounting evidence suggests that dwarfs and low surface brightness spirals are dominated by dark matter at all radii ( de  blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) , though this conclusion may not be universal ( swaters 1999 ) .      in spirals",
    ", the neutral hydrogen gas layer has an outer radius of 30  kpc ; planetary nebulae and globular clusters can be used to probe similar radii in ellipticals ( bridges 1999 ) .",
    "these tracers are generally consistent with an isothermal _ total _ mass distribution ( @xmath17 ) . in order to probe the outer radial profile and total extent of dark matter halos , a visible tracer at larger radii",
    "is required ( table  1 ) .",
    "model potentials of the milky way built to support the orbits inferred from radial velocities and proper motions of the magellanic clouds and stream yield a total of the milky way of @xmath18 inside 100  kpc ( lin , jones & kremola 1995 ) , about half of which must lie outside the present cloud distance ( @xmath050  kpc ) . to reconcile this with larger estimate of @xmath19 inside",
    "50  kpc necessitated by the enforcement of local group timing constraints and inclusion of leo i as a satellite ( kochanek 1996 ) , requires that the galaxy have a dark mass of @xmath20 and a total of mass of @xmath21 interior to 50  kpc ( sackett 1996 ) .",
    "such a mass distribution would have a lower circular velocity  as advocated by many authors , most recently merrifield & olling ( 1998 )  than the current iau standard value of 220  km  s@xmath22 .",
    "the dark distribution of the galaxy is thus likely to extend to at least 100  kpc .",
    "satellite kinematics have been used to argue that the mass distribution of both the milky way ( zaritsky 1998 ) and external galaxies ( zaritsky & white 1994 ) extends isothermally to more than 200  kpc , though this conclusion is in conflict with that of an earlier , smaller study that combined information from rotation curves and satellites to conclude that galactic potentials were already keplerian at 3 disk radii ( erickson , gottesman & hunter 1987 ) .    -0.4",

    "yielded slightly flattened halos with very large uncertainties ( schweizer , whitmore & rubin 1983 , whitmore , mcelroy & schweizer 1987 ) .",
    "subsequent studies using more detailed mass models and higher quality data over a larger radial range narrowed the range of dark density flattenings to @xmath24 ( arnaboldi  1993 , sackett  1994 , sackett & pogge 1995 ) . in each case",

    "-3.5 cm -4.25 cm -14.75 cm 8.5 cm 4.75 cm    combes & arnaboldi ( 1996 ) have also suggested that the dark matter distribution of ngc  4650a may be highly flattened , but toward the plane of the ring itself and thus misaligned from the flattened stellar body by 90@xmath25 .",
    "their ring model requires a stellar mass - to - light ratio of @xmath26 and a constant inclination angle of 85@xmath25 ( to produce a large line - of - sight correction to the ring velocities ) , that appear to be inconsistent with the color of the ring and its inclination as derived from optical imaging and h@xmath27 velocity fields .",
    "the substantially flattened halos inferred from x - ray gas and polar ring studies contrast sharply with those inferred from the kinematics of gas disks close to the equatorial plane . in order to fit the complicated pattern of dust lanes in the so ngc  4753",
    ", a precessing disk model was used by steiman - cameron , kormendy & durisen ( 1992 ) .",
    "the flattening is coupled to the assumed viscosity and age of the structure : if it has completed 6 or more orbits at all radii , the flattening must be quite modest , @xmath28 to avoid excessive winding .",
    "new  ( 1998 ) have applied a similar precessing , viscous , disk model in scale - free potentials to fit the warps observed in five spirals .",
    "they find that @xmath29 , a measure of the strength of the quadrupole moment , must be small ( @xmath30 , implying density axis ratios of @xmath31 for nearly axisymmetric structures older than one - tenth a hubble time .",

    "the longevity of misaligned warps in tilted halos may be limited , however ; simulations with responsive halos indicate that the disk and inner halo find a common plane in a few orbital times ( dubinski & kuijken 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , debattista & sellwood ( 1999 ) argue that misalignment of gas and halo angular momentum can create transient warps with appropriate characteristics even in spherical halos .",

    "a portion of the uncertainty is due to the unknown anisotropy of the gas motions . a similar analysis for the milky way yields a considerably rounder halo @xmath34 ( olling & merrifield 1997 ) .",
    "applied to the edge - on ngc  891 , the method gives substantially flattened density axis ratios of @xmath35 ( becquaert & combes 1998 ) , although non - flare models for the hi distribution and kinematics have also been put forward for this galaxy ( swaters , sancisi & van  der  hulst 1997 ) .",
    "-6.25 cm 6.75 cm = 6.5 cm    strong gravitational lensing provides a new way to measure the flattening of dark halos since the image positions and relative brightnesses are altered by the ellipticity of the foreground lensing potential .",
    "lensing is sensitive to the total mass column along the line of sight , so modeling of luminous mass of the galaxy and any nearby dark masses ( e.g. , external shear ) is required in order to derive accurate results , but the equilibrium assumptions required in most dynamical mass estimators play no role .",
    "lens models often require substantially flattened density distributions with @xmath36 for strong galactic lenses ( kochanek 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "the magnitude of the shear term required to reduce ellipticities to those representative of e and s0 galaxies may require internal shears due to misaligned dark and luminous lens mass ( keeton , kochanek & seljak 1997 ) . in some cases",
    ", strict limits can be placed on the flattening of the dark lensing density , even in the presence of known external shear , as indicated in fig .  2 which displays modeling results for a late - type lensing spiral at redshift z=0.415 ( koopmans , de  bruyn & jackson 1998 ) .",
    "lower limits on the dark halo flattening were obtained by constraining the velocity dispersion ( and thus external shear ) of the neighboring galaxy with the tully - fisher relation and , more conservatively , with the maximum rotation velocity of massive spirals .",
    "the dark halo shapes discussed here were inferred in different types of galaxies , on different spatial scales , with methods that have different systematic uncertainties and assumptions . some systems may present special advantages that allow techniques not possible elsewhere , but may not be representative of the general population .",
    "measurements at smaller radii may have the luxury of a wider variety of tracers and higher quality data , but are contaminated by the influence of the luminous mass .",
    "inferred shape parameters derived at large distances safely can be assumed to probe the dark matter distribution , but may assume an equilibrium condition that is less likely to satisfied at the large galactocentric radius of the tracer .",
    "the contribution of the dark matter to the inner rotational support of galaxies is still not fully understood , although it appears that it is dominant in fainter , lower surface brightness galaxies .",
    "several lines of evidence suggest that halos extend to @xmath37  kpc ; whether they extend to 200  kpc and beyond involves assessing conflicting evidence and model - dependent conclusions .",
    "the observational evidence taken together indicates that total density distribution near the optical radius ( @xmath38  kpc ) in spirals has an in - plane axis ratio @xmath5",
    ". if any of the measured ovalness is due to sources other than dark halo shape , dark matter halos at this radius may be even more axisymmetric .",
    "at least near the stellar body itself , dark halos are not strongly triaxial .",
    "the inferred values for halo flattening are more disparate .",
    "techniques that measure @xmath2 rather close to the equatorial plane of the stellar body return both quite spherical ( precessing warps ) and substantially flattened ( gas layer flaring ) results , even though they are applied to systems that appear to be quite similar .",
    "one might imagine that the dark potential is preferentially flattened near the equatorial plane due to the influence of the massive stellar disk ; the spherical results returned by the warp analysis therefore seem to indicate that effect of the disk is negligible .",
    "perhaps other mechanisms , like continual accretion , are responsible for shaping the distribution and velocity structure of the outer neutral hydrogen layer .",
    "it does seem clear that the gradient of the mass distribution near the galactic plane is not steep enough to suggest that the dark mass lies in a thin ( @xmath392  kpc ) disk .    at heights @xmath40  kpc above the equatorial plane , milky way halo star kinematics ,",
    "the geometry of x - ray isophotes , and polar ring studies all indicate that the dark mass is substantially flattened with @xmath41 . at these distances , there is some indication that for early - type systems the flattening of the dark and luminous mass may be similar .",
    "polar rings with flattened halos may be more likely to capture material onto polar orbits , but this selection effect is strongly countered by the short lifetime expected for differentially precessing rings accreted at a slightly skew angle in a non - spherical potential .    how do theoretical expectations square with these observational facts ?",
    "n - body simulations of dissipationless collapse produce strongly triaxial dark halos ( frenk  1988 , dubinski & carlberg 1991 , warren  1992 ) that are both oblate and prolate and thus at strong odds with the data .",
    "adding a small fraction ( @xmath010% ) of dissipative gas , however , results in halos of a more consistent shape  nearly oblate , @xmath5 , but moderately flattened , @xmath42 ( katz & gunn 1991 , dubinski 1994 , dubinski & kuijken 1995 ) .",
    "the dark halo shapes inferred from observations are thus consistent with expectations from cold dark matter simulations , as long as dissipative baryons form at least @xmath010% of the total mass within the volume relevant for the formation of the stellar galaxy .",
    "what can we expect as we look toward the future ? doubtless many of the techniques discussed here will be improved , and new ones invented .    harmonic analysis of two - dimensional velocity fields is likely to provide more detailed information about the non - axisymmetry of galactic mass distributions in different environments as the effect of spirals arms and warping is quantified .",
    "lensing may contribute to the question of dark halo shape at many levels because , although hampered with its own difficulties , it is insensitive to the ( often unknown and/or complicated ) dynamical state of the system . strong lensing , especially when applied to radio sources where extinction does not play a role in selection or altering image brightness , will become increasingly important in constraining the flattening of galactic mass distributions ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "if a substantial portion of galactic dark halos is composed of compact massive objects , microlensing may help determine not only the shape but the constitution of dark halos . in the near future",
    ", the promise of using multiple lines of sight ( galactic bulge , lmc , smc ) to probe the shape of the milky way microlensing halo ( sackett & gould 1993 ) will be hampered by small number statistics and ultimately perhaps by the possibility that a substantial number of the microlenses do not lie in the halo .",
    "if a considerable fraction of galactic dark matter _ is _ comprised of microlenses , projects to map the microlensing optical depth across the face of m31 will measure its intrinsic shape ( crotts 1992 , baillon  1993 ) .",
    "statistical weak lensing combined with redshift information is likely to become more important in constraining the outer radial profile of dark halos in a manner that is less model dependent than methods that rely on satellite dynamics .",
    "the cold kinematics and confined spatial distribution of very extended ( @xmath43  kpc ) hi features , such as tidal tails and `` leo rings '' will be a welcome addition in assessing the extent of galactic halos , if they can be found in sufficient number and characterized .    finally , the shape and extent of stellar debris trails from infalling satellites may also be an increasingly important probe of halo size and shape , especially if it can be combined with kinematical information , as may be possible with the launch of the space interferometry mission ( sim ) to measure proper motions of galactic stars brighter than 20th magnitude .",
    "simulations indicate that , if supported by ground - based programs to determine radial velocities , sim - measured proper motions of 100 stars in a tidal stream would be sufficient to determine the circular velocity and flattening of the galactic potential to within @xmath44% ( fig .",

    "<S> observationally , the geometrical form of the dark halo can be characterized by the equatorial axis ratio @xmath1 ( ovalness ) and vertical - to - equatorial axis ratio @xmath2 ( flattening ) of the total density . </S>",
    "<S> different techniques consistently yield @xmath3 ( and thus @xmath4 ) at r@xmath020  kpc , with more axisymmetric values , @xmath5 , being more likely . </S>",
    "<S> results are less consistent for the vertical flattening , perhaps due to the difference in the spatial regions probed by different techniques or inappropriate assumptions . techniques that probe furthest from the stellar plane ( @xmath615  kpc ) consistently implicate substantially flattened @xmath7 dark halos . </S>",
    "<S> these axis ratios are in acceptable agreement with expectations from n - body simulations of cold dark matter mixed with @xmath010% dissipational gas .    </S>",
