    "most supernovae are discovered at cosmological distances .",
    "rarely do they become as bright as sn 2011fe , a type ia supernova that recently erupted in m101 and peaked at b=9.9 . in recent times ,",
    "particularly bright supernovae were sn 1937c ( a type ia in ic 4182 , peaking at b=8.7 ; schaefer 1996 ) , sn 1972e ( type ia in ngc 5253 , peaking at b=8.6 ; branch et al .",

    "1994 ) , and of course sn 1987a ( a type ii in lmc , peaking at b=4.6 ; hamuy et al .",
    "such bright sne are subject to `` all - out '' observing campaigns , and the great amount of data collected over a wide range of wavelengths make them critical tests for models .",
    "the quest for the ultimate set of observational data on well observed supernovae may go on for years or decades after the event , with increasingly finer and more sophisticated comparisons , homogenization , re - calibration , and merging of independent sets of data ( clocchiatti et al .",
    "2011 have only recently obtained what they termed the `` ultimate '' lightcurve of sn 1998bw , a key supernova that together with sn 2003dh provided the first solid evidence of the connection between supernovae and long - soft gamma - ray bursts ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present our rich set of accurate @xmath0@xmath1@xmath4@xmath3 photometric measurements of sn 2011fe , covering 342 days , augmented by similar photometry of other two recent and bright supernovae , sn 2012aw ( type iip ) and sn 2012cg ( type ia ) , whose monitoring was stopped by solar conjunction while they were still in their early decline stages .",
    "it is known ( eg.suntzeffetal.1988 , clocchiattietal .",
    "2011 ) that time dependent differences in the lightcurves of supernovae obtained by different authors are the results of slightly different local realizations of the standard photometric passbands combined with the profoundly non - stellar character of supernova spectra ( dominated by time - variable strong absorption and emission ) .",
    "an enhancing feature of our set of @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2@xmath5 photometric measurements is that they have been independently and in parallel obtained with several different telescopes equipped with different ccd cameras and @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 filter sets , all adopting the same accurate photometric sequences calibrated by henden et al .",

    "red curves refer to common filters made with sandwiches of colored glasses , blue curves to multi - layer dielectric filters . the different amount of transmitted absorption and emission features is evident ( expecially on the red wing of @xmath1 filter passband ) , which account for the unavoidable differences in the photometry obtained with different telescopes even if a given sn is measured against the same identical photometric sequence.,width=302 ]    ) and stretching ( by @xmath6 ) around the pivot points ( @xmath7 ) the ordinates ( magnitudes ) of the reference ligthcurve ( plotted in red ) . _",

    "all measurements were carried out with aperture photometry , the long focal length of the telescopes and the smoothness of galaxy background around the three supernovae not requiring the use of psf - fitting .",

    "a similar sequence was established around sn 2012cg and adopted by all ans collaboration telescopes monitoring this supernova .",
    "the adopted transformation equations between local realizations ( small letters ) and the standard system ( capital letter ) take the usual form :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are constants describing the instantaneous realization of the standard system .",
    "their values , range of variability , and dependence upon filters , detectors , telescope , and atmosphere for ans telescopes are discussed in munari and moretti ( 2012 ) .",
    "the median value of the total error budget ( defined as the quadratic sum of the poissonian error on the supernova and the formal error on the transformation from the local to the standard system ) for the data collected on the three supernovae is 0.011 mag for @xmath0 , 0.007 in @xmath1 , 0.010 in @xmath4 , 0.016 in @xmath3 , and 0.010 mag for @xmath15 , 0.011 in @xmath16 , and 0.018 in @xmath17 .",
    "colors and band magnitudes are obtained separately during the reduction process , and are not derived one from the other .",
    "the spectra of supernovae are dominated by broad emission and absorption features and are completely different from the black - body like spectra of normal field stars used in transforming the local photometry to the standard system .",
    "local realizations of the photometric system include different atmospheric and filter transmission , detector sensitivity , efficiency of the optics . on normal stars ( like those making the photometric comparison sequence ) all these effects are collectively corrected for by the transformation eq .",
    "( 1 ) , provided that the local realization is sufficiently close to the standard system ( i.e. @xmath18 are close to 0.0 , and @xmath19 close to 1.0 ) .",
    "the spectra of supernovae , strongly dominated by broad and intense absorptions and emissions , are completely different from the black - body like spectra of normal field stars , and the eq.(1 ) transformations can only partially compensate for the differences between the local and the standard systems .    the situation is illustrated in figure  1 , where the measured transmission profiles for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 band filters in use with ans collaboration telescopes are overplotted with a flux - calibrated spectrum of sn 2012cg which was obtained on 2012 june 16.875 ut with the asiago 1.22 m telescope of the university of padova , operating at 2.31  / pix over the 3300 - 8100 range .",
    "these filters come from different manufacturers and are of both the multi - layer dielectric type ( profiles plotted in blue ) and the classical sandwich of colored glasses ( profiles plotted in red ) , typically built according to the standard recipe of bessell ( 1990 ) .",
    "some of the profiles shown in figure  1 are for brand - new filters , others for filters in long use at the telescopes and showing clear aging effects ( see munari and moretti 2012 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the lightcurves of the same supernova obtained with different telescopes will therefore show offsets among them , and these offsets will be time - dependent following the spectral evolution of the supernova .",
    "an example is shown in figure  2 ( middle panel ) , where our @xmath1-band data on sn 2011fe from different telescopes are compared . which of these lightcurve is the correct one  ?",
    "there is no _ a priori _ argument to prefer one or another , all of them referring to the same photometric calibration sequence , using the same extraction software , suffering from similar and very low formal errors .",
    "the closest representation of the _ true _ lightcurve appears to be a proper combination of all these individual lightcurves , effectively averaging over different observing conditions and instrumentation . to combine them into a merged lightcurve",
    ", we assume that all individual lightcurves from different telescopes are exactly the same one , affected only by an offset in the ordinate zero - point and a linear stretch of the ordinates around a pivot point : @xmath20\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where mag@xmath21 is the @xmath22-th magnitude value in the @xmath8 photometric band from the @xmath23-th telescope , mag@xmath24 is the corresponding value in the merged lightcurve , @xmath25 is the amount of zero - point shift and @xmath26 is coefficient of the linear stretching around the @xmath27 pivot point .",
    "the stretch is therefore a linear function of time difference with the reference @xmath28 epoch .",
    "the optimal values for @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 are derived by a @xmath29 minimization of the difference between the observed points and those defining the merged lightcurve : @xmath30 ^ 2}{[\\epsilon_{i , j}(\\lambda)]^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 sums over the different telescopes , @xmath22 over the individual measurements of each telescope , and @xmath31 is the total error budget of each measurement .",
    "the effect of shifting and stretching around a pivot point the ordinate values of a given lightcurve is illustrated in the top panel of figure  2 .",
    "the application of the method to the actual data we obtained for the three supernovae is illustrated in the middle and bottom panels of figure  2 , using the @xmath1-band observations of sn 2011fe as an example .",
    "the reduction of the dispersion around a common lightcurve is evident when comparing the middle and bottom panels of figure  2 .",
    "the coefficients for the other bands , colors , instruments and supernovae considered in this paper are similarly small .",
    "[ tab1 ]     [ tab2 ]     [ tab3 ]    notice that the lmm method to construct a merged lightcurve from observations obtained with different telescopes _ does not stretch _ the resulting lightcurve in flux ( compare how the orange line , the same curve in both panels , goes through the data in the middle and bottom panels of figure  2 ) , nor time ( the method acts only on the individual magnitude values , not the associated time tag ) .",
    "therefore , the lmm method does not interfere with the application of popular time- and brightness - stretching methods used to estimate the absolute magnitude of a supernova by comparison with a sample of template ligthcurves ( see below ) .",

    "being the first close type ia supernova detected in the ccd era , sn 2011fe will undoubtedly become the best observed thermonuclear supernova , well into its nebular stage , and a stringent test for theoretical models .",

    "the differences are probably due to the preliminary aavso comparison sequence that they used , based on only three stars , of similar colors and much redder ( @xmath0@xmath37@xmath1=+0.63 , + 0.68 , + 0.84 ) than the supernova at maximum brightness ( @xmath0@xmath37@xmath1=@xmath370.08 ) .",

    "the stretch method ( permutter et al . 1997 ; goldhaber et al . 2001 ) derives the decline speed and therefore the absolute magnitude by stretching the scale on the time axis of the lightcurve to fit a reference lightcurve .",
