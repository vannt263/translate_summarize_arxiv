    "neutrino energy losses play a decisive role in cooling of young neutron stars ( nss ) . during first @xmath10 yrs after the ns birth ,",
    "the cooling is dominated by the neutrino emission from the ns cores , of density exceeding the normal nuclear matter density , @xmath11 g  @xmath12 ( corresponding to the nucleon number density @xmath13 ) .    the emission of neutrinos results from the weak interaction processes involving baryons and/or leptons in the ns cores .",
    "the presence of the strong internal magnetic field allows an additional process  the neutrino synchrotron radiation of electrons .",
    "this process was considered by many authors ( e.g , kaminker et al .",
    "1991 , 1992 , and references therein ) for a spatially homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "it is widely accepted ( see , e.g. , takatsuka & tamagaki 1993 , and references therein ) , that neutrons and/or protons in the ns core can be superfluid .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath14 be the critical temperatures of the proton and neutron superfluidities , respectively .",
    "theoretical values of @xmath5 and @xmath14 are strongly model dependent and range from @xmath15 to @xmath16  k. for @xmath17 , the superfluidity of nucleons strongly suppresses the neutrino luminosity produced by the urca and bremsstrahlung processes in the ns cores ( e.g. , pethick 1992 , yakovlev & levenfish 1995 ) .",
    "this enhances the relative importance of the neutrino synchrotron process .",
    "it is commonly thought that superfluid protons form the type ii superconductor ( see sauls 1989 , and references therein ) .",
    "let us assume that the core of a newly born , hot and initially nonsuperfluid ns contains a magnetic field ( e.g. , primordial one , or generated at the ns formation stage ) .",
    "the transition to a superconducting state in the course of the stellar cooling would then be accompanied by a dramatic change in the spatial structure of the magnetic field .",
    "initially homogeneous field splits into an ensemble of fluxoids which contain a superstrong magnetic field , embedded in the field - free superconducting medium .",
    "so far , the neutrino synchrotron radiation has been studied only for a homogeneous magnetic field . in the present paper , we show that after the superfluidity onset , the neutrino synchrotron mechanism transforms into the neutrino pair emission due to the electron - fluxoid scattering .",
    "physical conditions in the superconducting ns cores are described in sect .  2 .",
    "in sect .  3 , we present general formalism of the electron - fluxoid ( @xmath18 ) scattering",
    ". the calculations of the neutrino emissivity are performed in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .  5",
    ", we estimate the emissivities of two additional neutrino production mechanisms which are usually neglected : the bremsstrahlung processes due to electron - proton ( @xmath19 ) and electron - electron ( @xmath20 ) scattering .",
    "no calculation of these emissivities has been done earlier , to our knowledge , although the importance of the @xmath19 scattering has been mentioned by schaab et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in sect .",
    "6 we show that the new mechanisms ( especially @xmath18 and @xmath20 scattering ) can be important in the ns cores with highly superfluid protons and neutrons since the superfluidity reduces strongly the familiar neutrino generation reactions ( urca processes , nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "the density within a ns core is expected to range from about 0.5@xmath21 at its outer edge ( lorenz et al .",

    "consists of neutrons , with a few percent admixture of protons , electrons , and possibly muons .",
    "the fraction of muons is usually much smaller than that of electrons , and a simple @xmath23 model is a good approximation . at higher densities , @xmath24",
    ", other particles may appear , such as hyperons , condensed pions and/or kaons , or even free quarks .",

    "the electrons form an ultrarelativistic and almost ideal gas , with the electron fermi energy @xmath25 ( 100300 ) mev , where @xmath26 is the electron number density .",
    "the neutrons and protons form strongly interacting fermi liquids .",
    "the fermi energy of neutrons is of the order of that of the electrons , while the fermi energy of protons is much smaller .    both nucleon species , @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    ", can be in a superfluid state ( for a review , see takatsuka & tamagaki 1993 ) .",
    "the superfluidity is widely accepted to be of the bcs  type ; the @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 pairing occurs due to nuclear attraction .",
    "let us focus on the proton superfluidity .",
    "in view of a relatively low proton number density , the inter - proton distance is rather high , and the @xmath30 interaction is attractive in the @xmath31 state .",
    "thus , the proton pairing is most likely to be in the @xmath31 state .",
    "recent reviews on the properties of superconducting protons in the ns cores are given by sauls ( 1989 ) and bhattacharya & srinivasan ( 1995 ) .",
    "the proton superconductivity is characterized by an isotropic energy gap in the single-(quasi)particle spectrum @xmath32 , which depends on temperature and density .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath5 is related to the zero - temperature energy gap @xmath33 by @xmath34 ( lifshitz & pitaevskii 1980 ) , where @xmath35 is the boltzmann constant .",

    "the nucleon effective masses are set equal to 0.7 of the masses of bare particles .",
    "the neutrino emissivities vary slowly with density ( below the direct urca threshold ) , i.e. , we present a typical situation within the ns cores . in both figures , we assume the presence of the ` primordial ' magnetic field @xmath327 , @xmath328 or @xmath329 g.    = 8.7 cm    figure 1 corresponds to a nonsuperfluid matter . if the magnetic field is absent , the murca processes are seen to be the most important ones , in the displayed temperature range .",

    "however , such temperatures are too low to be important for the cooling theories : the neutrino luminosity of ns becomes then smaller than the photon luminosity from the stellar surface , and the neutrino emission looses its significance as a source of the ns cooling .",

    "k the nucleon superfluidity is seen to strongly reduce all the neutrino production processes which involve nucleons .",
    "if the magnetic field were absent , the @xmath20 scattering would be the main neutrino generation mechanism at @xmath8 k. however , the @xmath18 scattering in the presence of @xmath338 g also becomes important , and it can even dominate .",
    "after the superfluidity onset ( @xmath61 ) , the magnetic field splits into fluxoids and the synchrotron radiation transforms into the radiation due to the @xmath18 scattering .",
    "this enhances @xmath78 owing to the field amplification within the fluxoids ( sect .",
    "the enhancement is more pronounced at lower @xmath339 g at which the field amplification is stronger .",
    "this is a rare case in which the neutrino emissivity _ increases _ with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "for the conditions displayed in fig .  2 , the proton plasma temperature @xmath340 k is much higher than the superfluid critical temperature @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the synchrotron regime ( sect .",
    "4.2 ) in the @xmath18 scattering operates only at @xmath341 , during the phase of the fluxoid formation .",
    "very soon after @xmath4 falls below @xmath5 , the synchrotron regime transforms into the bremsstrahlung regime ( sect .",

    "we have analysed a number of cases , varying the proton and neutron critical temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath14 .",
    "our principal conclusion is that the standard neutrino production mechanisms ( [ murca ] ) and ( [ nn ] ) dominate in the temperature domain of practical interest if either @xmath5 and/or @xmath14 are not too high ( not higher than about @xmath151 k ) .",
    "if , however , both critical temperatures are high , the situation is similar to that shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the superfluidity suppresses all the traditional neutrino generation mechanisms , and the main neutrino production at @xmath8 k comes either from the @xmath18 or the @xmath20 scattering .    in principle , neutrinos can be generated also in the @xmath30 collisions of _ normal _ protons in the non - superfluid cores of the fluxoids ( sect .",
    "2 ) as well as in the @xmath342 collisions . however , the non - superfluid cores are very thin , the emission volume is minor , and the first process is inefficient . the neutrino bremsstrahlung due to @xmath342 scattering is also inefficient since it occurs through electromagnetic interaction involving neutron magnetic moment ( e.g. , baym et al .",
    "1969 ) and since it is suppressed by the neutron superfluidity .    while it is commonly accepted that protons form a type ii superconductor , a possibility that they actually form a type i superconductor can not be excluded .",
    "this uncertainty results from the lack of a precise knowledge of the nucleon - nucleon interaction in dense nuclear matter , and from the approximations and deficiencies of the many - body theory of dense nucleon matter . in the case of a type i proton superconductor , which corresponds to @xmath343 ( de gennes 1966 ) , cooling below @xmath5",
    "is expected to be accompanied by a transition of the magnetized interior to an `` intermediate state '' ( de gennes 1966 , baym et al .",
    "the `` intermediate state '' would consist of alternating regions of normal matter containing magnetic flux , and superconducting regions exhibiting a complete expulsion of magnetic flux .",
    "the specific spatial structure of the `` intermediate state '' would result from the condition of the minimum of the thermodynamic potential at a fixed macroscopic magnetic flux ( de gennes 1966 ) .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that the presence of an `` intermediate state '' in the superconducting proton core will imply an enhancement of its electron synchrotron @xmath344 emissivity , compared to the case of a normal proton core , because of @xmath345",
    ". however , for @xmath346 this enhancement will be much smaller than that characteristic of the type ii superconductor , in which magnetic field is confined to fluxoids .",
    "we have considered ( sects .  3 and 4 ) the neutrino - pair radiation ( [ ef ] ) due to scattering of relativistic , degenerate electrons off threads of quantum magnetic flux",
    " fluxoids  in the @xmath23 matter within the superfluid ns cores .",
    "we have shown that this mechanism is a natural generalization of the synchrotron emission of neutrinos by electrons in a non - superconducting matter ( with a locally uniform magnetic field ) to the case in which the protons become superfluid and the magnetic field splits into the fluxoids . according to our results",
    ", this mechanism can operate either in the synchrotron ( sect .",
    "4.2 ) or in the bremsstrahlung ( sect .",
    "4.1 ) regime .",
    "we have obtained a simple fitting expression ( [ f1f2 ] ) which reproduces the emissivity ( [ qthrl ] ) for any parameters of practical interest .",
    "furthermore , we have estimated ( sect .",
    "5 ) the neutrino emissivities in two additional neutrino production mechanisms ( [ newnu ] ) , the @xmath19 and @xmath20 bremsstrahlung processes . in a non  superfluid matter",
    ", these mechanisms are much weaker than the standard neutrino emission mechanisms , such as the modified urca processes ( [ murca ] ) and the nucleon  nucleon bremsstrahlung ( [ nn ] ) .",
    "if , however , both superfluid critical temperatures , @xmath5 and @xmath14 , are higher than 10@xmath347 k , then the superfluidity strongly suppresses all the traditional ( standard ) neutrino energy losses .",
    "in such a case , the main neutrino generation in a ns core at @xmath8 k occurs either via the electron - fluxoid or via the @xmath20 scattering ( sect .",
