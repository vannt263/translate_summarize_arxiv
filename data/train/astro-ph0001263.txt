    "warm absorbers ( was ) are an important new diagnostic of the physical conditions within the central regions of active galaxies .",
    "they have been observed in @xmath050% of the well - studied seyfert galaxies and have also been detected in quite a number of narrow - line seyfert1 galaxies .",
    "so far , they revealed their existence mainly in the soft x - ray spectral region where they show up by their characteristic metal absorption edges .",
    "the study of the ionized material provides a wealth of information about the nature of the warm absorber itself , its relation to other components of the active nucleus , and the intrinsic agn x - ray spectral shape , and leads to a better understanding of agn in general .",
    "the presence of an ionized absorber was first discovered based on _ einstein _",
    "observations of the quasar mr 2251 - 178 ( halpern 1984 ) . with the improved spectral capabilities of _ rosat _ and _ asca _ , many more warm absorbers have been found , and theoretical modeling of plasma under ` warm absorber ' conditions has been pushed forward .",
    "below , we first provide a review on what is known on warm absorbers after the ` _ rosat _ and _ asca _ epoch ' of observations and theoretical modeling ( sect .",
    "we then discuss in more detail the possibility that several ( but not all ) warm absorbers contain dust ( sect .",
    "3 ) . in sect .",
    "4 we investigate the possible relation of wa and optical / uv emission line regions with focus on ngc4051 .",
    "is concerned with the warm absorber in mr2251 - 178 . in sect .",
    "7 we explore whether and under which conditions a warm absorber provides an explanation for the dramatic x - ray spectral variability of rxj0134 - 4258 .",
    "the active nucleus is thought to contain an accreting supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , surrounded by the putative molecular torus and two emission line regions , the broad line region ( blr ) and the narrow line region ( nlr ) .",
    "the physical properties of the two emission line regions are quite well known , since a wealth of information can be extracted from emission line intensities , line profiles , line shifts , and line variability ( see peterson 1993 for a review ) .    concerning the nature and location of the warm absorber , several different models",
    "have been suggested : ( i ) a relation of the wa to the blr ( a high - density component of the inner blr , a blr confining medium , winds from bloated stars , or a matter bounded blr component ; see , e.g. , reynolds & fabian 1995 , shields et al . 1995 ,",
    "netzer 1996 ) , ( ii ) an accretion disk wind ( e.g. , knigl & kartje 1994 , murray et al .",
    "1995 ) , ( iii ) a relation to the torus ( e.g. , reynolds 1997 , komossa & fink 1997b ) , or ( iv ) a relation to the nlr ( see , e.g. , the two - component wa model of otani et al .",
    "the reason for the large variety of models discussed is that not all physical properties of the warm absorber ( its density @xmath1 , column density @xmath2 , covering factor @xmath3 = @xmath4 , distance @xmath5 from the nucleus , elemental abundances @xmath6 , its velocity field , and the shape of the illuminating continuum ) can be directly determined from x - ray spectral fits , but only certain combinations of these parameters , defined below .",
    "the two most important quantities are the column density @xmath2 and ionization parameter @xmath7 of the warm absorber .",
    "@xmath2 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the total hydrogen density , and @xmath10 the thickness of the absorber .",
    "the ionization parameter @xmath7 is defined as @xmath11 here , @xmath12 relates to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) which illuminates the warm absorber , and is the number rate of photons above the lyman limit ( @xmath13 hz ) , given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the distance between observer and warm absorber .",
    "the mass of the warm absorber is approximately given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 cm and @xmath18 @xmath19 .    from direct spectral fits , one first determines @xmath7 and @xmath2 .",
    "if the intrinsic continuum turns out to be variable , or if there is evidence that the warm material contains dust , important constraints on the density and distance of the absorber from the nucleus can be obtained from reaction - timescale arguments , and dust survival arguments , respectively . in particular , the recombination timescale @xmath20 of a warm absorber is given by @xmath21 ( krolik & kriss 1995 ) where @xmath22 is the ion abundance ratio of the metal ions dominating the cooling of the gas , @xmath23 the electron density , and the last term is the corresponding recombination rate coefficient @xmath24 ( shull & van steenberg 1982 ; for coefficients @xmath25 , @xmath26 see aldrovandi & pequignot 1973 ) .",
    "available observations locate most warm absorbers outside the bulk of the blr .",
    "[ b ]      so far , ionized absorbers have been mainly observed at x - ray energies ; therefore , most of our knowledge on this material comes from the analysis of x - ray spectra .",
    "warm absorbers show up in the soft x - ray band by their characteristic x - ray absorption edges which are created by k - shell photoionization of highly ionized metal ions .",
    "the warm material is thought to be photoionized by emission from the central continuum source in the active nucleus ( for a detailed model invoking shocks ( meier & demmig 1997 ) in addition to photoionization see contini & viegas 1999 ; see also the discussion in nicastro et al .",
    "its degree of ionization is higher than that of the bulk of the blr and the gas temperature is typically of order 10@xmath27 k. fig .",
    "1 shows the x - ray spectrum of a typical warm absorber .",
    "the most prominent absorption edges are marked . in case of high covering factor of the warm absorber ,",
    "x - ray emission and reflection becomes significant and will partially fill up the edges ( e.g. , netzer 1993 ( his fig . 1 - 3 ) , 1996 ) .",
    "warm absorbers have been mostly modeled using the codes _ cloudy _ ( ferland 1993 , ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) and _ ion _ ( netzer 1993 , 1996 ) . for several years",
    ", the ionized absorbers were assumed to be dust - free ; partly because they were observed in bright , optically unreddened seyfert1 galaxies , and there was no necessity at all to suspect this highly ionized material to contain dust .",
    "the situation changed with the cases of 3c 212 ( mathur 1994 ) , iras13349 + 2438 ( brandt et al . 1996 ) , and ngc3227 ( komossa & fink 1996 , 1997a ) : 3c 212 is a quasar with a heavily reddened optical spectrum .",
    "its x - ray spectrum was successfully fit by several models including a powerlaw plus excess cold absorption ( elvis et al . 1994 ) .",
    "since other multi - wavelength observations did not indicate a cold absorber of high column density along the line of sight , mathur ( 1994 ) suggested that the dust that reddens the optical spectrum is mixed with a _",
    "warm _ absorber , instead .",
    "she also showed that this material can consistently account for the observed mgii uv absorption of 3c 212 .",
    "in the cases of iras 13349 and ngc3277 the large column density @xmath28 of dusty gas inferred from optical observations is inconsistent with the one ( @xmath29 ) derived from x - ray spectral fits in the sense that @xmath30 ( hereafter referred to as ` @xmath31 discrepancy ' ) .",
    "the inconsistency disappears , if the dust is accompanied by _",
    "ionized _ gas .",
    "further candidates for dusty warm absorbers which show the same @xmath31 discrepancy emerged quickly : ngc3786 , mcg6 - 30 - 15 , iras17020 + 4544 , and possibly 4c74.26 ( see tab .",
    "1 ) . warm absorber _ models _ taking into account the presence of dust were first presented by komossa & fink ( 1996 , 1997a ) and applied to the _ rosat _ x - ray spectrum of ngc4051 ( which turned out to be likely dust - free , see sect . 4 below ) , followed by ngc3227 , ngc3786 ( which are well fit by dusty warm absorbers ; komossa & fink 1997b , c ) , and mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( which likely possess a two - component wa one of which is dusty ; reynolds et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in an alternative approach , reynolds ( 1997 )",
    "correlated the optical depths of ovii and oviii of a sample of seyferts with the ` steepness ' of the uv continuum which he took as reddening indicator .",
    "except for two outlyers , most of the objects of his sample show low reddening and weak ovii absorption , whereas four objects show the opposite ( high reddening , a larger optical depth of ovii ) and these latter are suggested to likely host _ dusty _ warm absorbers .",
    "no such trend is found for oviii .",
    "warm absorbers have also been observed in several narrow - line seyfert1 galaxies ( nlsy1s hereafter ; e.g. , vaughan et al . 1999 ,",
    "komossa & meerschweinchen 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to the ` standard ' warm absorbers with strong edges of ovii and oviii around 0.7 - 0.8 kev , peculiar absorption features have been reported around @xmath01 kev ( e.g. , brandt et al . 1994 , otani et al . 1996a , ulrich - demoulin & molendi 1996 , hayashida 1997 , leighly et al .",
    "1997 , matt 1998 , ulrich et al .",
    "1999 , vaughan et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "most interpretations of these feature focussed on warm absorbers , albeit in very different ways .",
    "the suggested explanations are : ( i ) _ non - solar metal abundances _ : absorption around 1.1 kev could be due to ne - k absorption but would require a rather peculiar abundance ratio of ne / o for the ne absorption to be much stronger than the o absorption . in addition , the strongest ne edge in most models is located at 1.36 kev at somewhat higher energies than observed ; komossa & fink 1998 , ulrich et al .",
    "alternatively , it could be caused by fe - l absorption ( applied to pg1404 + 226 this requires an fe overabundances of @xmath32 solar ; ulrich et al .",
    "( ii ) a warm absorber in _ relativistic outflow _ ; the @xmath01 kev feature is then caused by highly blueshifted ovii or oviii edges ( leighly et al .",
    "1997 ; see also brandt et al .",
    "1994 and otani et al .",
    "( iii ) a sequence of _ resonance absorption lines _ in combination with a steep x - ray spectrum ( nicastro et al . 1999c ) .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , though , that the observed features seem to occur always close to the position where the declining soft excess emission intersects the powerlaw component , and the possibility remains that the absorption feature is only mimicked by a more complex spectral shape .",
    "further , in the case of ark564 the feature is better described by an emission line than an absorption complex ( vaughan et al . 1999 , turner et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the ` x - rays - only ' approach to study warm absorbers suffers from the still limited spectral resolution of current x - ray detectors making measurements of , e.g. , red / blueshifts of the absorption edges difficult . a powerful approach to constrain further the properties of warm absorbers",
    "is to combine the x - ray with uv observations , and to search for the signature of the warm absorbers simultaneously in both spectral regions .",
    "the relation between uv and x - ray ( cold ) absorbers was examined by ulrich ( 1988 ) .",
    "mathur and collaborators ( e.g. , mathur 1994 , mathur et al . 1994 , mathur et al . 1995 ) then presented several good cases ( 3c 212 , 3c351 , ngc5548 ) where uv and x - ray warm absorber are very likely one and the same component ( see also dekool & meurs 1994 on pg1416 - 129 ) .",
    "these absorbers are outflowing with velocities of @xmath01000 - 3000km / s and are located outside the blr .",
    "three further good candidates for a common uv  x - ray warm absorber are the high - redshift quasar pks 2351 - 154 ( schartel et al . 1997 ) , the sy1 galaxy ngc3783 ( shields & hamann 1997 ) , and the quasar pg 1114 + 445 ( mathur et al . 1998 ) .",
    "hamann et al .",
    "( 1995a ) reported the detection of neviii@xmath33774 absorption in the quasar um675 , and noted that this gas could act as x - ray warm absorber .",
    "telfer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) analyzed the very highly ionized bal system of the quasar sbs 1542 + 541 and concluded that it is likely associated with an x - ray warm absorber .",
    "sometimes , though , the uv absorption is rather complex and shows the presence of different components with different degrees of ionization and/or velocities ( e.g. , ngc 3516 , kriss et al",
    ". 1996b , crenshaw et al . 1998 ; ngc5548 , mathur et al . 1999 ; ngc7469 , kriss et al .",
    "1999 ) , and only one component ( e.g. , ngc5548 ) or none ( e.g , ngc7469 ) may be identified with the x - ray warm absorber . in any case , the near one - to - one match of the presence of uv- and x - ray warm absorbers in a sample of seyfert1 galaxies ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) suggests a common or related origin of uv and x - ray absorbing material .",
    "[ t ]    [ c4 ]      examples of uv - euv lines that become strong under warm absorber conditions were given in , e.g. , krolik & kriss 1995 ( their fig .",
    "4 ) , shields et al .",

    "observationally , the euv emission line neviii@xmath33774 was detected in the spectra of high - redshift quasars ( hamann et al .",
    "1995b , c , 1998 ) and was suggested to originate from a warm absorber .",
    "( x - ray spectra of these objects are not yet available for a check and more detailed modeling ) .",
    "a more detailed approach then was to select individual , well observed agn and to investigate whether the physical conditions in one of the observed optical - uv emission line regions and the x - ray warm absorbers are identical , such that the ionized x - ray absorber could be directly identified with one of the known ( high - ionization ) emission line regions .",
    "mathur et al . ( 1994 ) presented detailed modeling of the belr of the quasar 3c351 which also shows an x - ray warm absorber , and concluded that high - ionization belr and warm absorber of 3c351 are not one and the same component .",
    "komossa & fink ( e.g. , 1997a , b ) studied the cases of ngc4051 ( summarized and extended in sect . 4 below ) and ngc3227 .",
    "they first derived all warm absorber properties that can be determined from x - ray spectral fits , then varied the remaining free parameters ( like metal abundances ) , predicted for each case the optical / uv line emission from the x - ray absorbing gas and compared with optical observations .",
    "again , they concluded that warm absorber and clr in ngc4051 , and wa and emission - line components in ngc3227 show different physical conditions .",

    "below , we describe in more detail the properties of dusty warm material , and provide a summary of the suggested candidates for dusty was including explicit spectral model fits .",
    "several changes occur in the presence of _ dust _ mixed with the warm absorber : ( i ) gas - dust interactions influence the thermal conditions in the gas and change its ionization state ( e.g. , draine & salpeter 1979 ) . in particular , for high ionization parameters dust effectively competes with the gas in absorbing photons ( laor & draine 1993 ) .",
    "( ii ) dust scatters and absorbs the incident radiation and x - ray absorption edges are created by inner - shell photoionization of metals bound in the dust ( see figs 4,5 of martin & rouleau 1991 ) .    under",
    "the following assumptions we ( komossa & fink 1997b , komossa & bade 1998 ) have calculated a sequence of dusty warm absorber models using ferland s ( 1993 ) code _ cloudy _ : ( i ) the dust composition ( graphite and astronomical silicate ) and grain size distribution were chosen like in the galactic diffuse interstellar medium ( mathis et al . 1977 ) if not mentioned otherwise , as incorporated in _ cloudy _ , ( ii ) the metal abundances were depleted correspondingly ( a mean of cowie & songaila 1986 ; see ferland 1993 , baldwin et al .",
    "1991 for details ) , ( iii ) the warm material was assumed to be of constant density and ionized by a ` mean seyfert ' ir to gamma - ray continuum ( with @xmath38=1.4 in the euv ) .",
    "the main consequences of the presence of dust internal to the warm absorber can be summarized as follows :    * absorption edges in the x - ray spectrum from neutral metals bound in the dust , like a carbon ci edge ( from the graphite species ) and an oxygen oi edge ( from silicate ) are predicted .",
    "[ the shift in edge energy due to solid state effects ( e.g. , martin 1970 , adamietz et al .",
    "1993 ) is only of the order of a few ev ( greaves et al .",
    "* there is a stronger temperature gradient across the absorber , with more gas in a colder state .",
    "this and the previous effects lead to an _ effective flattening _ of the x - ray spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) * the increased sensitivity of dust to radiation pressure ( e.g. , chang et al . 1987 , binette et al .",
    "1997 ) likely causes the gas to outflow ( if not otherwise confined ) leading to temporal changes of the absorber properties .",
    "[ indeed , strong variability in x - ray count rate of factors 10 - 15 has been detected from the dusty - warm - absorber candidates ngc 3227 and ngc 3786 ( komossa & fink 1997b , c . ) ] * the warm absorber emission in certain optical / uv lines , in particular the iron coronal lines , is much reduced because of the depletion of iron into dust grains .",
    "[ this likely also alleviates the problem of the recently reported potential over - prediction of these lines from some warm absorbers ; see sect . 4 below ] .",
    "we have investigated most suggested dusty - wa candidates with our models .",
    "we get successful x - ray spectral fits . in some cases",
    "the best - fit parameters can deviate substantially from those obtained by fitting a dust-_free _ warm absorber , though .",
    "table 1 gives a summary of the suggested dusty warm absorber candidates and the model results .",
    "the ionization parameters are found to be somewhat lower than those of dust - free warm absorbers , with the exception of iras17020 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dusty warm absorbers show a rather narrow range in column densities @xmath2 which differ by less than a factor @xmath02 .",
    "this is likely partly caused by selection effects : firstly , x - ray warm absorbers of _ lower column density _ are difficult to detect presently , and small deviations of the balmer decrement from the recombination value are less straight forwardly interpreted in terms of reddening .",
    "secondly , in case of _ higher _ column density the dusty gas becomes optically thick , and the concept of the standard extinction curve can no longer be applied .      in case dust",
    "is mixed with the warm absorber , important constraints on its density and locations can be obtained from the requirement of dust survival : firstly , dust is heated and destroyed by the radiation field of the central source if at distances less than @xmath39 ( e.g. , netzer 1990 ; see laor & draine 1993 for a dependence of this relation on grain size ) . secondly , dust is heated by collisions with gas particles ( e.g. , baldwin et al .",
    "1991 ) to a temperature that exceeds the evaporation temperature if the gas density is high enough .",
    "both approaches locate the dusty warm absorbers outside the blr .",
    "one component that suggests itself to be identified with the dusty warm absorber is an atmosphere of the molecular torus which plays an important role in unification schemes .",
    "the torus has the advantage that it is ` known ' to be present ( no need to invent a new component ) , and would provide a natural reservoir for dust close to the central power source ( but far enough away to ensure dust survival ) .",
    "one is then lead to a viewing geometry such that our line of sight grazes the torus atmosphere in those seyferts that show dusty warm absorbers ( see also the discussion in brandt et al .",
    "1996 , reynolds 1997 , and komossa & fink 1997b , c ) .",
    "looking at tab . 1 , one question arises immediately : the dusty warm absorbers seem to come in _ all types _ of seyfert galaxies , which is not what would be expected in a simple viewing - geometry - scenario .",
    "the sample is still small , though , and it might be interesting to re - investigate this possibility once the dusty warm absorbers are confirmed , and further ones are known .    the other already earlier suggested dusty component of the active nucleus , and thus potential dusty warm absorber counterpart , is the dusty transition region between blr and nlr ` invented ' and studied by netzer & laor ( 1993 ) .",
    "the ionization parameter of this region should show a smooth transition to that of the blr and nlr , though ; whereas the ionization parameters of warm absorbers are typically much higher .      the line of arguments in favor of dusty warm absorbers ( reviewed in sect .",
    "2.2.2 ; see brandt et al .",
    "1996 and komossa & fink 1997b for many further details ) relies on several assumption .",
    "firstly , optical and x - ray observations were not performed simultaneously .",
    "variability in the optical reddening on the timescale of years is possible in seyferts ( e.g. , goodrich 1989 , 1995 ) , but we note that for both , iras17020 and iras13349 optical spectra taken at many different epochs are available and they do not show evidence for changes in reddening ( e.g. , siebert et al .",
    "secondly , optical - uv and x - ray photons may not travel along the same l.o.s , and they may therefore ` see ' different amounts of dust and gas",
    ". this would be the case if the x - rays were seen mainly in scattered light , or if there was a strong starburst contribution .",
    "since most of the seyferts with dusty warm absorber candidates are rapidly variable in x - rays ( e.g. , a factor of @xmath02 within 800 s and a factor @xmath010 within a few years in case of ngc3227 ; komossa & fink 1997b ) these two possibilities can be excluded .",
    "as far as the _ modeling _ of dusty warm absorbers is concerned , one uncertainty is the applicability of the code _",
    "cloudy_. more precisely , radiation pressure may drive strong outflows of the dusty gas . in case of large velocity gradients ,",
    "the treatment of overlapping resonance lines becomes inaccurate ( ferland 1993 ) , and the heating - cooling balance might be disturbed by expansional cooling of the gas .",
    "another uncertainty are the dust properties : is the dust in seyfert galaxies sufficiently similar to galactic ism - like dust ( and is the latter really ` mrn'-like in nature ) ?",
    "firstly , galactic ism - like dust was also assumed to estimate the amount of dust from the optical spectra .",
    "therefore , making the same assumption in modeling the x - ray data is a good starting point .",
    "secondly , observations by iso suggest that the dust / gas ratio in other galaxies does not deviate much from the galactic value ( e.g. , bianchi et al .",
    "thirdly , even for other dust compositions or structures , the x - ray absorption structure would not change strongly , because the x - ray spectrum is not dominated by complex molecular transitions and solid state and chemical effects ( these may have some influence on the heating - cooling balance , though ) , but by k - shell photoionization of metals bound in the dust .",
    "given the presence of x - ray absorption edges of neutral dust - bound metals like the carbon edge , dusty warm absorbers , if confirmed with _",
    ", _ axaf _ and _",
    "astro - e _ , will play an important role not only in probing components of the active nucleus , like the dusty torus , but also are they a very useful diagnostic of the ( otherwise difficult to determine ) dust properties and dust composition in other galaxies .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , < \" , ]",
    "given the several good candidates for dusty warm absorbers the question emerges whether _ all _ warm absorbers contain dust .",
    "we think this is unlikely because ( i ) warm absorbers have also been observed in several seyfert1 galaxies that do not show evidence for optical reddening , and ( ii ) in some cases the modifications in the x - ray absorption spectrum due to the presence of dust are so strong that no successful x - ray spectral fit is possible .",
    "dust - free warm absorbers might contribute significantly to the emission in optical / uv iron coronal lines . in the following",
    "we shall examine in detail the warm absorber in the nlsy1 galaxy ngc4051 with respect to the question whether this ionized material can account for the optical coronal lines observed in this galaxy .",
    "this is an update of our earlier work on this subject ( see komossa & fink 1997a ; kf97a hereafter ) .",
    "we first give a brief summary of previous observational properties of ngc4051 relevant for the present study ( taken from kf97 ) : ( i ) to model the warm absorber and to predict its line emission , we compiled the observed sed of the galaxy from the literature ( see fig . 1 of kf97a ) ; based on photon counting arguments , we found evidence for an euv bump in the spectrum of ngc4051 .",
    "( ii ) intensity ratios of coronal lines were taken from the literature ( e.g. , de robertis & osterbrock 1984 , penston et al .",

    "( iii ) a warm absorber fit to our _ rosat _ pspc spectrum of ngc4051 yields @xmath40 = 0.4 and @xmath41 = 22.7./h@xmath42 deviates from the recombination value .",
    "if we try to model the x - ray spectrum of ngc4051 with a one - component dusty warm absorber we do not get a successful spectral fit .",
    "the possibility remains , though , that there is a second , dusty warm absorber of low column density present .",
    "in fact , there are some residuals around the carbon edge after fitting a dust - free warm absorber .",
    "since these could also be of instrumental origin , higher spectral resolution data are required to search for a second , dusty , warm absorber in ngc4051 . ]",
    "further , from variability arguments we derive a limit on the density of the warm absorber , @xmath43 @xmath44@xmath45 , which translates into a distance from the nucleus of @xmath46 cm .",
    "we then checked , for this best - fit warm absorber model , the strengths of the optical / uv lines originating from the ionized material ; in particular , the fe lines [ fevii]@xmath336087 , [ fex]@xmath336374 , [ fexi]@xmath337892 , and [ fexiv]@xmath335303 ( see tab .",
    "we find that all of them are _ much weaker _ than observed !",
    "we then varied those parameters that not strongly influence the x - ray absorption structure , but could have an effect on the predicted fe line strengths ; namely : the metal abundances , the gas density , the euv continuum shape , the ir continuum strength .",
    "we find that in all cases , the lines [ fevii][fexi ] remain much weaker than observed by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the reason for this is that the warm absorber is always _ too highly ionized _ , with a totally negligible amount of fe@xmath47 and fe@xmath48 ions in the gas .",
    "therefore , changes in collisional strengths for the relevant fe transitions , which are still poorly known , are not expected to alter this result .",
    "we conclude that , for the case of ngc4051 , _ warm absorber and coronal line region are _ not _ one and the same component , but of different origin_. this is consistent with the recent findings of nagao et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that the [ fexi ] emission of ngc4051 is not confined to the nucleus , but widely extended ( out to at least @xmath0150 pc ) .",
    "recently porquet et al .",
    "( 1999 ; p99 hereafter ) presented a parameter space study of the strengths of fe coronal lines that originate from warm absorbers .",
    "they conclude that fe lines in low - density absorbers ( they studied the density range @xmath49 = 812 ) are over - predicted for part of the parameter space . comparing our earlier results on ngc4051 ( komossa & fink 1997a ) with their recent results , we find both to be consistent : for warm absorbers dominated by oviii absorption and high ionization parameters , no overprediction in line emission occurs ( their tab .",
    "the question remains whether the ` ovii absorbers ' of p99 do indeed overpredict the fe lines and thus are in conflict with observations .",
    "we suggest that most of the strong ovii absorbers likely contain dust ( which was not included in the models of p99 ) , as proposed by reynolds ( 1997 ) .",
    "the strong depletion of fe into dust grains then results in weaker gas phase emission in the fe coronal lines .",
    "finally , we note that our more general search for a warm - absorber origin of of one of the emission - line regions observed in the uv / optical spectra of seyfert galaxies did not give a single example with a one - to - one match ( see komossa & fink 1997e for a brief overview ) ; emission lines from warm absorbers are always _ weaker _ than observed lines .",
    "however , the possibility of a ( weak ) warm - absorber contribution to individual emission lines ( e.g. , civ in the case of ngc3227 ; komossa & fink 1997b ) remains .",
    "mr2251 - 178 at redshift @xmath50=0.068 was the first quasar to be discovered in x - rays , in the course of the _ ariel v _ all - sky survey ( cooke et al . 1978 , ricker et al .",
    "it turned out to be an outstanding object in many respects .",
    "it has a high ratio of @xmath51 , is surrounded by a giant hii envelope observed in [ oiii ] emission , and was the first object in which a warm absorber was discovered ( halpern 1984 ) .",
    "based on _ exosat _ and _ ginga _ observations pan et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and mineo & stewart ( 1993 ) , again , interpreted and modeled the data in terms of the presence of a warm absorber .",
    "in contrast , walter & courvoisier ( 1992 ) , in an independent analysis explained the observations in terms of a variable powerlaw spectral shape , and concluded the presence of a warm absorber was unnecessary to explain the x - ray data .",
    "reynolds ( 1997 ) , in the course of a large sample study of _ asca _ observations of agn reported the detection of ovii and oviii absorption edges in the x - ray spectrum of mr2251 .    here ,",
    "we present first results from a detailed analysis of a deep archival _ rosat _ pspc ( trmper 1983 , briel et al .",
    "1994 ) observation of this source performed in nov .",
    "1993 with a duration of 18 ksec .",
    "x - ray data reduction was carried out in a standard manner ( see komossa 2000 , in prep . ) . in total ,",
    "36  x - ray sources were detected with a likelihood @xmath52 10 within the field of view .",
    "the positions of those in the vicinity of mr2251 are shown in fig .",
    "[ mr_ima ] , overlaid on an optical image from the digitized palomar sky survey .",
    "the mean source countrate was 3.1 cts / s , a factor of 3 stronger than during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey observation performed in 1990 .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve is displayed in fig .",
    "[ mr2251_light ] .",
    "first , we fit a single powerlaw to the total x - ray spectrum .",
    "cold absorption was fixed to the galactic value towards mr2251 , @xmath53 @xmath19 ( lockman & savage 1995 ) , since it is underpredicted otherwise .",
    "this gives @xmath54 and clearly is a very poor description of the data ( @xmath55 ; fig .",
    "[ mr_x ] ) .",
    "a raymond - smith emission model does not fit the spectrum at all , even if temperature , normalization , metal abundances and the amount of cold absorption are all treated as free parameters .",
    "we then tried two - component spectral fits involving a powerlaw plus soft excess parametrized by different models .",
    "the quality of the fit remains unacceptable , though .",
    "the presence of a warm absorber markedly improves the fit .",
    "performing a two - edges fit with edge energies fixed at the theoretical values of ovii and oviii we obtain @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the not yet totally satisfactory quality of the fit , @xmath59 , can be traced back to a deviation of the low energy part of the spectrum ( between 0.10.18 kev ) from the model prediction which already caused an underprediction of the galactic @xmath60 in the pure powerlaw fit .",
    "if this part of the spectrum is excluded from the spectral fitting , we obtain @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "we conclude that a warm absorber is clearly present in this source .",
    "the narrow - line seyfert1 galaxy rxj0134 - 4258 is one of the rare sources which showed dramatic spectral variability .",
    "its spectrum changed from ultrasoft ( @xmath65 ) in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) to flat ( @xmath66 ) in our pointed pspc observation taken two years later while its countrate remained nearly constant ( greiner 1996 , komossa & fink 1997d , komossa & greiner 1999 , komossa et al .",
    "1999b , grupe et al .",
    "2000 , komossa & meerschweinchen 2000 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this kind of spectral variability is the presence of a warm absorber . in particular",
    ", we have studied the following two scenarios ( details are given in komossa & meerschweinchen 2000 ; km2000 hereafter ) :      _ _ we find that a warm absorber of ionization parameter @xmath67 and column density @xmath68 fits well the rass observation of this source ( @xmath69 ; fig . 8) . to account then for the much flatter spectrum during the later pspc observation requires a change in ionization state of the warm absorber . since the intrinsic luminosity of the source did not vary strongly from one to the other observation , it is then required that the ionization state of the warm absorber reflects the ( unobserved ) history of the variability in the intrinsic luminosity ( see km2000 for details ) . after allowing for non - equilibrium effects in the absorber and/or a range in densities ,",
    "such a warm absorber is consistent with the long- and short - timescale variability behavior of rxj0134 - 4258 .",
    "we did not favor this possibility in our earlier work , because it introduces a new level of complexity ( more free parameters ) as compared to the simpler case of an absorber in equilibrium .      in summary , we find that a warm absorber fits well the _ rosat _ survey observation , and residuals around the expected location of absorption edges are still present during our later pointed pspc observation .",
    "in addition , the presence of high - ionization uv absorption lines in this object was recently reported by goodrich ( talk at the narrow - line seyfert1 workshop in bad honnef , dec .",
    "1999 ) , and the recent study by crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggests a near one - to - one match of the presence of uv and x - ray warm absorbers .",
    "we conclude , that the presence of a time - variable warm absorber is a viable explanation for all available x - ray observations of rxj0134 - 4258 .",
    "high - spectral resolution data taken during episodes of repeated spectral variability of this source are required to distinguish this from other possible scenarios like real changes in the steepness of the powerlaw or a powerlaw plus soft excess description ( see komossa & meerschweinchen 2000 ) .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank gary ferland for providing _ cloudy _ , smita mathur for very useful and pleasant discussions , and the organizers for carrying out this exciting workshop .",
    "this workshop was funded by the inter - research centers cooperative program of the jsps and the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft dfg .",
