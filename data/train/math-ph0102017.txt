    "exactly solvable models have attracted much attention since the early years of quantum mechanics .",
    "some solvable potentials have become standard examples of text books , but a lot more have been discovered by various approaches .",
    "systematic work has been done to generate and classify these potentials using the factorization method @xcite , algebraic methods @xcite and more recently , in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susyqm ) @xcite .",
    "these approaches were found to be interrelated with each other @xcite .",
    "the most general family of solvable potentials is the six - parameter natanzon class @xcite , which contains potentials with solutions expressible in terms of a single ( confluent ) hypergeometric function .",
    "a rather important subclass of this is that of the shape - invariant potentials @xcite , to which the most well - known potentials ( such as the harmonic oscillator , coulomb , pschl  teller , etc . )",
    "potentials belong .",
    "altogether 12 such potentials have been identified @xcite , but some of these , actually represent different forms of the same potentials , and their separate discussion is justified only for historical reasons .",
    "an important recent development was the introduction of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susyqm ) , which can be considered a re - interpretation of the factorization method @xcite , and which links basically isospectral potentials in a pairwise manner .",
    "shape - invariant potentials are defined in terms of susyqm : the functional form of the susyqm partner potentials has to be the same , and only the parameters appearing in them can be different .",
    "susyqm has been found rather useful in generating new solvable potentials as susyqm partners from known solvable ones .",
    "a rather wide potential class is obtained as the susyqm partner of natanzon potentials , but these are not natanzon potentials themselves ( except in the case of shape - invariance ) , since their solution is written as the linear combination of several ( confluent ) hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "there are also further solvable potentials which are solved by functions other than the ( confluent ) hypergeometric type .",
    "examples for this are the square well @xcite and the exponential potential , which are solved by bessel functions .",
    "a different concept of solvability characterizes quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) potentials @xcite . in this case",
    "only part of the eigenstates can be obtained , by requiring termination of a recursion relation defining the eigenfunctions in a polynomial form .",
    "the most recent concept of solvability is related to conditionally exactly solvable ( ces ) potentials .",

    "there are , however , further considerations regarding normalizability and regularity , which might impose restrictions on the solvability of certain potentials .",
    "not surprisingly , these may play a more important role in the case of the less `` trivial '' potentials @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the other class of ces potentials @xcite has completely different nature , and does not belong to the natanzon class , rather it has features typical for susy partners of general natanzon - class potentials .",
    "this again confirms our finding that the concept of conditionally exact solvability is not an alternative of exact solvability , rather it classifies potentials according to different principles .",
    "we analyzed the potentials introduced originally in ref . @xcite as conditionally exactly solvable ( ces ) potentials via the method of point canonical transformation .",
    "our results concerned the following three areas .    _",
    "i ) _ we gave a supersymmetric re - interpretation of this potential class .",
    "_ ii ) _ we examined the cubic formula which determines implicitly the energy eigenvalues of the problem .",
    "we rigorously took into account boundary conditions of the eigenfunctions , and corrected certain inaccuracies presented in ref .",
    "we demonstrated that from the three roots of the cubic equation there is only one ( the middle one ) which can lead to physically acceptable eigenstates .",
    "_ iii ) _ we interpreted this potential in the general framework of the natanzon potential class , and demonstrated that this ces potential , in fact , belongs to this class , and therefore it is a _ bona fide _ exactly solvable problem .",
