    "the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations have recently announced strong evidence for the existence of the top quark , the isospin partner to the @xmath0 quark required in the standard model ( sm ) , using @xmath1 and @xmath2 data samples respectively of @xmath3 collisions at @xmath4 tev .",

    "@xcite , @xcite the branching ratio br ( @xmath8 ) is taken to be @xmath9 , and this is a valid assumption in the minimal sm ( i.e. one higgs doublet ) ; the decays @xmath10 , @xmath11 are absent at tree level due to the gim mechanism , and the charged current processes @xmath12 , @xmath13 are negligible due to heavy ckm matrix suppression ( @xmath14 is usually predicted in such models and could be quite large due to higgs bosons coupling in proportion to mass . in some extended models ( although not all ) , @xmath15 is still allowed by current electroweak precision tests , and if such a light @xmath16 exists then on ",
    "shell @xmath17 decays will occur .",
    "this would provide an alternative decay channel for the top quark and is an option not considered in refs .",
    "it is the aim of this work to examine whether the presence of a light @xmath16 is compatible or not with the cdf data .",
    "we shall consider in particular the case of @xmath18 gev i.e. @xmath16 within the discovery range of lep2 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the various extended higgs models that may contain a light @xmath16 .",
    "section 3 examines how significant the channel @xmath17 can be , while section 4 studies how one would search for @xmath16 . in section 5",
    "we apply the analyses of sections 3 and 4 to the current data sample from the tevatron , while section 6 considers prospects at an upgraded tevatron and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "finally section 7 contains our conclusions .",
    "the minimal sm consists of one higgs doublet ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , although extended sectors can be considered and have received substantial attention in the literature . for a general review",
    "there are two main constraints on such models :    * there must be an absence of flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) . * the rho parameter , @xmath21 , must be very close to one .    condition ( i ) is satisfied by constraining the yukawa couplings to the fermions @xcite .",
    "condition ( ii ) requires models with only doublets , to which any number of singlets ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) can be added .",
    "models with triplets ( @xmath24 ) can also be considered , although obtaining @xmath25 is achieved in a less natural way than for cases with only doublets .",
    "the theoretical structure of the two  higgs  doublet model ( 2hdm ) is well known @xcite , while the general multi  higgs  doublet model ( mhdm ) @xcite has received substantially less attention . in the mhdm it is conventional to assume that one of the charged scalars is much lighter than the others and thus dominates the low  energy phenomenology doublets there exists @xmath26 @xmath16s . ] .",
    "the relevant part of the lagrangian for the 2hdm and mhdm can be written as @xcite : @xmath27 here @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) denote left and right  handed up ( down ) type quark fields , @xmath32 is the left  handed neutrino field , and @xmath33 the right  handed charged lepton field .",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the diagonal mass matrices of the down type quarks , up type quarks and charged leptons respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the ckm matrix , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are coupling constants ( see below ) .",
    "the cp conserving 2hdm which is usually considered in the literature @xcite contains an important parameter @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 being real vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgs doublets and @xmath44 .",
    "there are 4 variants of the 2hdm depending on how the doublets are coupled to the fermions .",
    "their coupling constants are given in table 1 @xcite .",
    "ii@xmath45 + @xmath38 & @xmath46 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath47 + @xmath39 & @xmath48 & @xmath48 & @xmath48 & @xmath48 + @xmath40 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath47 & @xmath46 +    in the mhdm @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are _ arbitrary _ complex numbers .",
    "it follows that combinations of parameters like @xmath49 have different values depending on the model under consideration , thus leading to phenomenological differences .",
    "this has important consequences , particularly when one calculates loop diagrams involving @xmath16 .",
    "one such decay , @xmath50 , is sensitive to charged scalars and has recently been observed for the first time by the cleo collaboration .",
    "the value for the branching ratio was measured to be @xcite @xmath51 which corresponds to @xmath52 the theoretical calculation of the branching ratio appears in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . from this",
    "it can be shown @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that the above bound constrains @xmath53 from the 2hdm ( model ii and ii@xmath45 ) to be @xmath54 gev , while no bound can be obtained on @xmath53 from the 2hdm ( model i and i@xmath45 ) and the mhdm .",
    "hence it is possible that an on  shell @xmath16 from these latter models contributes to top decay , and may even be light enough to be detectable at lep2 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "also , we note that the most popular model with higgs isospin triplets ( htm ) @xcite , @xcite , predicts a charged scalar @xmath55 which has exactly the same couplings as @xmath16 ( 2hdm , model i ) , and thus may also contribute to top decay and/or be detectable at lep2 @xcite .",
    "for all these @xmath16s there exists a lower bound from lep @xcite of @xmath56 gev .",
    "an important constraint on @xmath48 is obtained from precision measurements of the @xmath57 vertex .",
    "charged scalars with a tree level @xmath58 coupling contribute to this decay , and ref .",
    "@xcite shows that @xmath59 this bound is for @xmath60 gev and @xmath61 gev , and provides a stronger constraint on @xmath62 than can be obtained from the decay @xmath50 .    in order to search for @xmath16",
    "one needs to consider its decays . the various branching ratios ( brs )",

    "the brs are dependent on the arbitrary parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and thus span the full range @xmath74 .",
    "in this section we evaluate how competitive the decay channel @xmath75 can be compared to the conventional @xmath76 .",

    "the 2hdm ( models i and i@xmath45 ) requires the replacements @xmath80 and @xmath81 . from eq .",
    "( 6 ) one can evaluate the partial width and thus br @xmath82 @xcite : @xmath83\\cot^2\\beta \\over m^2_w(m^2_t+m^2_b-2m^2_w)+(m^2_t - m^2_b)^2}\\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath84 and @xmath85 refer to the magnitude of the three momentum of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 measured in the rest frame of the top quark .",
    "we take @xmath88 gev , @xmath89 gev and @xmath90 gev .    in figure",
    "[ fig : top6 ] we plot br @xmath82 as a function of @xmath47 for @xmath91 gev ( comfortably in the lep2 range ) , for @xmath92 ( at the edge of the lep2 range ) , and for @xmath93 gev ( out of lep2 range ) .",
    "we recall that eq .",

    "as @xmath47 increases br @xmath82 falls , dropping to @xmath98 at @xmath99 .",
    "hence for large enough @xmath47 and/or @xmath53 the top decay to charged higgs will be difficult to detect experimentally . we shall be particularly interested in the case of @xmath100 i.e. for @xmath16 in the discovery range of lep2 .    in the mhdm , br @xmath101 )",
    "depends not on @xmath47 but instead on @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "however , it is easily verified from eq .",
    "( 7 ) ( unless @xmath102 is unnaturally large  see below ) that the strongly dominant part is proportional to @xmath104 which has the same constraint as @xmath48 ( eq . 5 ) .",
    "therefore figure 1 can be used for the mhdm , with the replacement @xmath105 on the ordinate axis .",
    "we note that there exists an unnatural region of parameter space , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , coming from the measurement of @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite uses @xmath108 for @xmath18 gev , although with the new measurement in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , @xmath109 is more accurate . ] which would allow larger brs in the mhdm for a given @xmath53 than is ever possible in the 2hdm .",
    "we shall not consider this possibility .",
    "we shall consider two ways with which to detect @xmath16 from top decays .",
    "the first method is to search in the lepton channel . we see from table 2 that the decays of @xmath16 violate lepton universality due to a preference to couple to the heaviest lepton ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the lepton decays of @xmath71 .",
    "the second method is to search for the quark decays of @xmath16 by reconstructing the invariant masses of the jets .",
    "a significant peak separate from that of @xmath71 would be distinctive . a search using the di  lepton channel @xmath111 ( via @xmath112 ) has been performed @xcite although we shall not consider this method here .",
    "we shall focus first on the @xmath113 decays of @xmath16 .",
    "a previous search in this channel has been performed at the tevatron using a @xmath114 data sample @xcite . here",
    "br ( @xmath17)=100% was assumed which we know now to be untrue since @xmath115 , and so on  shell @xmath76 decays are definitely present . in ref . @xcite the process @xmath116 was searched for with the trigger being missing @xmath117 gev . from figure 1",
    "we see that br ( @xmath118 can be as low as @xmath119 , and in such cases the above detection method is certainly not relevant for future searches .",
    "one must rely on the process @xmath120 , with a hard isolated lepton ( @xmath121 or @xmath122 ) to act as a trigger @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we also require a @xmath110 jet to which various cuts will be made @xcite .",
    "non @xmath123 backgrounds , although sizeable , are substantially reduced when the above requirements are applied .",
    "the main background is from @xmath124 which fakes the signal from @xmath125 and is usually the more common top decay process .",
    "fortunately this background can be reduced by making use of the polarisation of the @xmath126 . to be specific",
    "we shall focus on @xmath127 and @xmath128 , thus following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "weak vector bosons couple to left ",
    "handed fermions and right  handed antifermions , and thus @xmath129 .",
    "however this is not so for the charged higgs ( @xmath128 ) which couples to right handed fermions via @xmath130 .",
    "this is a consequence of the yukawa couplings .",
    "it has been known for some time that the momentum distribution of the decay products from @xmath126 depend on its polarisation @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyses these differences for the hadronic decays @xmath131 .",
    "it concludes that the energetic particles coming from @xmath127 are primarily @xmath132 and @xmath133 , with the subscript @xmath134 referring to a transversely polarised meson . in comparison ,",
    "the energetic particles coming from @xmath128 are @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 with @xmath138 referring to a longitudinally polarised meson .",
    "the case of the energetic @xmath137 from @xmath128 can easily be understood in the following way . due to polarisation of the parent @xmath139 , spin conservation favours emission of the @xmath137 in the direction of motion of the @xmath139 .",
    "this results in the @xmath140 spectrum in the context of @xmath123 production of the @xmath137 being boosted compared to those pions coming from @xmath127 decay ( in the latter case the @xmath137 prefers to be emitted _ opposite _ to the direction of the parent @xmath139 ) .",
    "therefore the fragmentation function of @xmath137 from @xmath141 is harder than that from @xmath142 , and so a hard pion is a signal of @xmath128 decay .",
    "the subsequent decays of @xmath143 and @xmath144 , @xmath145 have different energy distributions depending on the polarisation of the parent meson . ref .",
    "@xcite shows that for the @xmath135 the final state pions will be much more asymmetric in energy than those originating from @xmath133 . for the case of the @xmath132",
    "the three pions tend to share the energy equally , while for the @xmath136 one or two of them are soft with the rest hard .",
    "hence the signature of the @xmath128 is a final state of one or more energetic pions .",
    "it is straightforward to evaluate the theoretical prediction for the number of energetic pions from top decay .",
    "we take first the case of @xmath146 .",
    "one of the @xmath147s is decayed to @xmath64 to act as a trigger for the event , while the other is decayed to @xmath113 .",
    "the theoretical prediction is : @xmath148 here @xmath149 is a shorthand for br ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath150 is the number of @xmath123 pairs produced . the parameter @xmath151 is an overall efficiency for detecting an energetic pion from the above event , incorporating any kinematical cuts .",
    "it can be written as @xmath152 the summation is over the three possible decays of @xmath139 to pions : @xmath153 , @xmath154 are extra pions originating from @xmath155 , and @xmath156 respectively , while @xmath157 .",
    "for the case of @xmath158 theory predicts @xmath159 with @xmath160 being different to @xmath151 .",
    "this latter difference arises due to the polarisation of the parent @xmath110 and thus @xmath161 .",
    "there are two ways of searching for violation of lepton universality .",
    "the first method ( applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to the ssc ) requires an isolation cut on the energetic pion .",
    "this eliminates virtually all of the qcd background , although also has the disadvantage of removing most of the hard pions originating from @xmath162 and @xmath163 . a second method ( suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ) aims to include these latter decays by rejecting the isolation cut , and instead making a cut on @xmath164 carried by the neutral pions .",
    "the signal favours large @xmath165 .",
    "this method keeps more of the signal than would be kept by making the isolation cut , although the qcd background is larger .",
    "the lepton trigger efficiency , @xmath166 and @xmath167 , depends only on @xmath168 and is therefore the same for both events .",
    "we will ignore the case of both top quarks decaying to a charged higgs ( @xmath169 ) for the following reasons :    * br @xmath170 could well be very small ( see figure 1 ) . *",
    "the trigger here would be @xmath171 .",
    "this process would be suppressed in models with lower br ( @xmath172 ) i.e.",
    "2hdm ( model i ) , htm and various mhdm , coupled with the fact that br @xmath173 . *",
    "the trigger decay in ( ii ) predicts @xmath63 with less @xmath140 than for the @xmath63 originating from @xmath174 .",
    "hence it is less likely to pass the lepton trigger cut .    reasons ( ii ) and ( iii ) also allow us to ignore events @xmath175 which fake @xmath176 . we can quantify the amount of deviation from universality that would be caused by a non ",
    "zero @xmath177 : @xmath178 with @xmath179 being the number of standard deviations by which the observed number of hard , isolated pions exceeds that predicted from universality .",
    "this concludes our account of the search for @xmath172 .",
    "the second method is to consider the @xmath180 decay and reconstruct the invariant masses of the jets .",
    "this method would be needed for the case of a ` leptophobic ' higgs i.e. br @xmath181 and br @xmath182 , which is possible in the mhdm for large @xmath103 and small @xmath102 , @xmath183 .",
    "the trigger will again be a hard isolated lepton originating from @xmath184 .",
    "three jets need to be reconstructed in the opposite hemisphere to the lepton ( i.e. the jets originating from @xmath185 ) , with one of them a tagged @xmath0 jet ( efficiency @xmath186 ) .",
    "@xcite deals with this method applied to the ssc , and the analysis is also relevant for the tevatron with a few minor modifications e.g. the @xmath140 cuts given in ref .",
    "@xcite are larger than those required at the tevatron due to @xmath187 at the ssc being much greater . adding the invariant masses of the non @xmath0 jets will result in a peak centered on @xmath53 .",
    "however , one must be careful here because in the mhdm it is possible to have a large br @xmath188 @xcite ; in this scenario there is a chance of the wrong @xmath0 jet being tagged and therefore the wrong jets would be used to reconstruct the invariant mass of @xmath16 .",
    "however , br @xmath189 would be needed to cause significant problems here , and ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the parameter space for this large branching ratio is quite small .",
    "requiring that the three ",
    "jet invariant mass is centered on @xmath168 reduces the background further .",
    "a clear peak would be strong evidence for @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite suggests the following simple rule for this method to provide a significant peak at @xmath53 : @xmath190 this result was obtained by using the isajet monte carlo , comparing the size of the @xmath16 peak to the @xmath71 background for different values of @xmath47 and @xmath53 .",
    "it is only valid for a large event sample ( at the ssc @xmath191 ) , and so will be more relevant at an upgraded tevatron and/or lhc . if eq .",
    "( 12 ) is satisfied , the statistical significance of the peak at @xmath53 is greater with a larger event sample , i.e. at the lhc .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( 12 ) was derived using ssc detection efficiencies ; however it will still be valid at the tevatron to a good approximation .",
    "contributes to the relative size of the peaks at @xmath192 and @xmath53 .",
    "this is the only factor which may invalidate eq .",
    "( 12 ) for use at the tevatron . ]    in this section we have studied two direct ways with which one may search for @xmath16 . in the next section",
    "we shall apply these techniques to the current data sample from the tevatron to see if a light ( @xmath193 gev ) charged higgs boson could have been observed .",
    "the current cdf data sample at the tevatron [ 1 ] contains @xmath194 . for @xmath195 we shall use the mrs(a ) partons @xcite which suggests a value of 4.5 pb if @xmath88 gev pb . ] @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimates that the theoretical error in @xmath195 is @xmath196 .",
    "we can now evaluate the expected number of @xmath123 pairs , and then use eqs .",
    "( @xmath197 ) to predict the number of hard pions for various values of br @xmath170 .",
    "we shall take @xmath198 ; from table 2 one has br @xmath199 and br @xmath200 .",
    "if there is no charged higgs boson i.e. br @xmath201 then one has from eq .",
    "( 8) : @xmath202 the efficiency @xmath151 is given by eq .",
    "( 9 ) , and we shall discuss its value below . the prediction for @xmath177",
    "is given by eq .",
    "we shall take br @xmath203 for illustrative purposes i.e. the maximum br for @xmath91 gev ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "thus we obtain : @xmath204 we shall consider the search strategy using an isolation cut on the charged pion . as mentioned before this eliminates most of the qcd background .",
    "the charged pion is required to contain at least @xmath205 of the energy in a cone of size @xmath206 , as well as possessing @xmath207 gev .",
    "this removes most of the @xmath147 background contribution from @xmath208 and @xmath209 and most of the signal contribution from @xmath209 @xcite .",
    "therefore we may use the following approximations in eq .",
    "( 9 ) : @xmath210 the efficiency @xmath160 will be larger than @xmath151 for the following reasons . most importantly",
    ", @xmath211 i.e. pions originating from @xmath16 are more energetic ( see section 4 ) and are more likely to pass an energy cut than those from @xmath71 . using the figures in ref .",
    "@xcite we can approximate @xmath212 .",
    "also we want to maximise the signal for illustrative purposes and so take @xmath213 the @xmath214 gev cut has little effect on @xmath215 and @xmath216 ; the isolation cut hardly affects the @xmath217 contribution but removes part of the @xmath208 contribution .",
    "hence in reality @xmath218 . for heavier @xmath16",
    "the pion is on average more energetic and so @xmath219 will increase .",
    "the trigger efficiencies for an isolated , @xmath220 gev lepton ( @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) are close to 100% @xcite . combining the above efficiencies ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath221 . from table 2",
    "we can obtain the value of br @xmath222 for the various higgs models .",
    "the maximum signal is obtained when br @xmath223 ) for @xmath224 and in the mhdm . however , in the calculation we also use br @xmath203 , and both these brs can only be satisfied simultaneously in the mhdm for @xmath225 and @xmath183 large . ] and we will use this in our calculation .",
    "the remaining parameter values needed are br ( @xmath226 and br ( @xmath227 .    using the above values for efficiencies and brs in eqs .",

    "also , we used the most favourable values for br @xmath231 , br @xmath170 and @xmath160 .",
    "lower values for these parameters would decrease @xmath177 further e.g. for @xmath91 gev , @xmath232 and br @xmath233 ( model i ) we find @xmath234 . therefore we conclude that , over the vast majority of parameter ( @xmath53 , @xmath47 ) space , @xmath16 would not provide a statistically significant signal given the current data at the tevatron .",

    "the top quark search [ 1 ] relied on an excess of @xmath237 jet events over the qcd background .",

    "if br ( @xmath257 then the lower error bar on @xmath250 lies just outside the maximum value of @xmath255 ( 5.85 pb ) .",
    "therefore lower branching ratios than this are more desirable . from figure 1",
    "we see that a considerable parameter space exists for br ( @xmath258 ; in such cases @xmath250 would only be increased by @xmath259 and so a sizeable portion of the lower error bar would still lie within the region of @xmath255 .",
    "therefore we conclude that top quark decays to charged higgs scalars are consistent with the current cdf data over a very large parameter space of @xmath47 and @xmath53 .",

    "the higgs models we are studying differ noticeably from the susy @xmath16 with respect to br ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the difference arises because susy requires model ii couplings @xcite and thus br ( @xmath17 ) has a sinusoidal dependence on @xmath47 with a minimum at @xmath272 .",
    "in contrast we are studying model i and i@xmath45 type couplings which cause br ( @xmath17 ) to fall with increasing @xmath47 ( figure 1 ) .",

    "the latter collider would maintain a @xmath229 signal in model i@xmath45 ( model i ) for @xmath93 gev if @xmath289 ( 8) .",
    "the other detection method available is to reconstruct the invariant masses of the quark decays of @xmath16 .",
    "certainly this method will be needed in the case of a leptophobic higgs ( see section 4 ) which is possible in the mhdm .",
    "figure [ fig : top5 ] shows that for such a higgs a noticeable peak at @xmath53 can be obtained if @xmath274 gev ( 130 gev ) for @xmath290 ( 2 ) .",

    ". @xcite are improved .",
    "we have studied the prospects for detecting charged higgs scalars @xmath302 contributing to top quark decay ( @xmath17 ) in the context of the non  minimal standard model .",
    "considered were @xmath16s from the 2hdm ( models i and i@xmath45 ) , htm and mhdm , all of which escape the mass bounds from @xmath50 and thus may be light enough to contribute to top quark decay .",
    "two detection methods were presented :    * searching for an excess of energetic pions ( @xmath303 ) over that predicted from lepton universality . * reconstructing the quark decays of @xmath16 .",
    "neither method is able to extract a statistically significant signature of @xmath16 with the current cdf data sample ( 67 pb@xmath288 ) at the tevatron , and even the expected 140 pb@xmath288 ( available by the end of 1995 ) will prove insufficient over most of the parameter ( @xmath53 , @xmath47 ) space .",
    "thus the existence of a light @xmath16 ( 50 gev @xmath304 ) is fully consistent with current data , and may be searched for at lep2 .",
