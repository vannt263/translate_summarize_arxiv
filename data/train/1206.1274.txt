    "in the euclidean space @xmath2 a _ helix surface _ or a _ constant angle surface _ is an oriented surface such that its normal vector field forms a constant angle with a fixed direction in the space .",

    "can be thought as a killing vector field with constant norm .",
    "thus , if we want to generalize the notion of helix surfaces in a 3-dimensional riemannian manifold , a natural problem is to study surfaces such that their normal vector field forms a constant angle with a killing vector field of constant norm .",
    "+ among the three dimensional manifolds , beside the space forms , probably the most important are the 3-dimensional homogeneous manifolds .",
    "most of these spaces admit a killing vector field of constant norm and thus it is natural to study the corresponding helix surfaces .",

    "+ we also would like to point out that , in a similar way , we can define helix submanifolds in higher dimensional euclidean spaces and we advise the interested reader to have a look at @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , in order to take a step towards the classification of helix surfaces in 3-dimensional homogeneous manifolds , we consider surfaces in the 3-dimensional berger sphere which is defined , using the hopf fibration , as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 be the usual 2-sphere and let @xmath7 be the usual 3-sphere .",
    "then the hopf map @xmath8 , defined by @xmath9 is a riemannian submersion and the vector fields @xmath10 parallelize @xmath11 with @xmath12 being vertical and @xmath13 , @xmath14 horizontal .",
    "the vector field @xmath12 is called the _ hopf vector field_. the berger sphere @xmath15 , @xmath16 , is the sphere @xmath11 endowed with the metric @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents the canonical metric of @xmath11 .",

    "this means that the notion of helix surfaces in @xmath15 , with @xmath22 , is meaningful only in the non compact case .",
    "for this reason our study will be local and it will aim to the following characterization of helix surfaces which represents the main result of the paper .    * theorem *  * [ teo - principal ] . *",
