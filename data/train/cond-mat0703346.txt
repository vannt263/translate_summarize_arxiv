    "recent advances in methods for trapping and controlling ultracold atoms have opened up the promising possibility of directly simulating strongly interacting many - body hamiltonians .",
    "these experimental systems can be used to engineer and analyze models that lie beyond the scope of present analytical and numerical methods , thus potentially shedding new light on fundamental quantum many - body problems  @xcite such as the the nature of the mechanism for high-@xmath0 superconductivity or whether a true spin liquid can be realized .",
    "such systems can be formed by trapping atomic gases in one- , two- , or three - dimensional optical lattices .",
    "the interactions can be accurately tuned by adjusting external fields . in a similar spirit , it has recently been proposed to simulate strongly correlated systems in experiments by studying the dynamics of polaritons in arrays of electromagnetic cavities , see ref .  .",
    "the techniques for manipulating ultracold atoms are fairly advanced and have already enabled a broad range of astonishing systems , such as a superfluid , a mott insulator  @xcite , a strongly interacting fermi gas  @xcite or also mixtures of bosonic and fermionic gases  @xcite .",
    "however , the subsequent analysis of their properties has proven to be difficult . in view of the application to solid state problems , it is crucial to have tools at hand that can accurately describe the engineered state , preferably by extracting the correlation functions of the atomic gas .",
    "a recent proposal  @xcite for a universal probe of correlations suggested measuring the shot noise in time - of - flight images of the expanding cloud of atoms after release from the trap .",
    "this method is based on the fact that , after a long enough time of flight @xmath1 , the density distribution of the expanding cloud becomes proportional to the momentum distribution in the interacting system  @xcite , @xmath2 with momentum @xmath3 for an atom of mass @xmath4 .",
    "the noise in the image - by - image statistics is governed by higher order correlations of the initial state @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an internal quantum number , e.g. , the spin , that allows different states to be distinguished . by analyzing the shot noise in several mean - field states , altman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the presence of a particular order leaves a very distinctive fingerprint on the noise correlations , e.g. , due to superconductivity or spin order . on the experimental side , this quantity has already been measured on several occasions , in both fermionic and bosonic cold atomic gases , i.e. , in bosonic mott insulators  @xcite , fermionic superfluids  @xcite , and band insulators  @xcite .",
    "in the following , we will treat one - dimensional ( 1d ) fermionic systems on an optical lattice and will concentrate on the noise correlations of the lattice model itself : @xmath7 here the brackets denote the ground state expectation value . shortly after the pioneering analysis of ref .  , which was based on mean - field calculations , mathey _ et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the shot noise for a 1d tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid within a bosonization approach , allowing them to explore the momentum - dependence around opposite fermi points , i.e. , around @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in these",
    "tl liquids , different types of order compete , leading to a rich structure in the noise correlations . in the present paper",
    ", we employ the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite to study the noise correlations in the 1d extended hubbard model .",
    "this numerical approach allows us to go beyond the luttinger theory and to uncover the full set of features that are contained in the noise correlations within the entire brillouin zone . in the vicinity of opposite fermi points",
    ", we find perfect agreement with the analytical predictions of ref .  .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : noiseproperties ] , we discuss general properties of noise correlations , independent of the microscopic model . the extended hubbard model considered in this work",
    "is then introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : hubbardmodel ] , together with a summary of the different ( quasi-)orders encountered in our numerical approach .",
    "our main results , the analysis of the noise correlations for different phases of the extended hubbard model , are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiments ] , we make the connection to atomic physics and discuss experimental issues .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "before considering a specific microscopic model , it is useful to discuss several general properties of the noise correlation functions at the lattice level . in the following , we consider the noise correlations  ( [ eq : g ] ) on a periodic lattice with @xmath10 sites . in this case , @xmath11 denotes the lattice momentum and @xmath6 describes an internal quantum number that we associate with the spin , i.e. , @xmath12 . in general , @xmath6 can denote a more general flavor or species index ; the statements below remain valid as long as the density operator @xmath13 can be written as a product of creation and annihilation operators that satisfy the canonical fermionic commutation rules @xmath14 it is convenient to use the fourier transformation @xmath15 so that the creation and annihilation operators in coordinate space also obey the standard commutation relations . under these assumptions , @xmath16 satisfies the following exact statements :    1 .   _",
    "bounds : _ for all @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath16 is uniformly bounded @xmath19 independent of the system size , i.e. , @xmath20 itself can not diverge with system size .",
    "sum rules : _ in a system in which the number of particles of every species is conserved , the noise correlations satisfy the sum rule @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "equal - spin momentum diagonal : _ along the momentum diagonal @xmath23 , the equal spin @xmath24 shot noise is given by @xmath25 this part of the noise correlation function is therefore completely determined by the momentum distribution function @xmath26 itself and does _ not _ contain any other information .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if there is only one ordering tendency in the system , it can be identified unambiguously . however , as soon as there are two or more competing phases , one has to include additional information to distinguish between them .",
    "finally , we would like to put these numerical results in context with respect to experiments . initially , the atoms would be confined in an optical lattice . by using pbc in our numerical calculations ,",
    "we have neglected the presence of a shallow confining potential as well as the open ends of the 1d system .",
    "we have tested the sensitivity of the shot noise to the choice of boundary conditions in the case of a combined cdw / sdw ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : sdwcdw ] .",
    "qualitatively , we find exactly the same features for opc as for pbc , namely , a pronounced dip along @xmath27 in @xmath28 , indicating the presence of a cdw , and a less distinct valley along @xmath29 in @xmath28 and @xmath30 , reflecting the sdw ordering ( not shown ) . after the trap is turned off , the atom cloud expands freely , allowing the momentum distribution @xmath31 as well as the noise correlations @xmath32 to be measured .",
    "the relationship between the freely expanding atom cloud and the initial lattice states of the trapped atoms is explained in detail in ref .  .",
    "we are thus confident that our results directly apply to experimental realizations and measurements .",
    "the summary of features present in the noise correlations ( tab .",
    "[ tab : summary ] ) clearly illustrates the necessity for state - selective measurements to distinguish different phases , as the sign of the signal reveals only the character of the fluctuation , i.e. , particle - hole- or particle - particle - like .",
    "we have analyzed the noise correlations ( density - density correlations in momentum space ) in various phases of the extended hubbard model in one dimension .",
    "our numerical density - matrix renormalization group study , carried out for several characteristic interactions and fillings , shows that different types of ( quasi-)long - range order leave different fingerprints in the shot noise .",
    "this allows different phases to be identified and distinguished with a universal probe .",
    "the method is therefore of interest for experiments with ultracold atoms , in which the shot noise can be extracted from time - of - flight images .",
    "we have also pointed out the importance of sum rules , i.e. , the fact that the integral of over the brillouin zone is equal to zero , which leads to the interesting effect that noise features due to correlations must be compensated by a ( possibly nonsingular ) complementary structure . in the future , it would be desirable to obtain similar ab - initio results for the noise correlations of various fermionic systems in two dimensions , notably the repulsive hubbard model at and away from half filling .",
    "furthermore the effect of finite temperature on the noise profiles needs to be investigated .",
    "we are grateful to o.  sushkov and t.  giamarchi for valuable discussion .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss national science foundation .",
    "the ed calculations were performed on the cray xt3 at cscs ( manno , switzerland ) .",
    "one of us ( a.m.l . ) acknowledges the warm hospitality of the school of physics at unsw ( sydney , australia ) during his stay in the final stage of the project .",
    "for @xmath33 and small on - site interactions @xmath34 , one can calculate the noise correlations in perturbation theory . in the momentum representation , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) reads @xmath35 with the dispersion @xmath36 and fermi momentum @xmath37 .",
    "to first order , the ground state wave function is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fermi sea .",
    "at zero temperature , the momentum distribution of the noninteracting system reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the unit step function . for convenience ,",
    "we also define @xmath42 .",
    "the first corrections arise in second order perturbation theory and are therefore independent of the sign of @xmath43 @xmath44 \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath45      for _ non - interacting _",
    "fermions on a chain with pbc , @xmath46 because @xmath47 commutes with the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "analogous to the momentum distribution , the lowest order corrections to the noise correlations are quadratic in @xmath43 and thus also independent of the sign        the normalized noise correlations @xmath51 obtained in this perturbation calculation are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : metal - perturbation ] for a metallic system at filling @xmath52 . compared to the dmrg results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : metal ] , the positive peaks in the vicinity of opposite fermi points due to particle - particle correlations are more pronounced , but , otherwise , the perturbative approach leads to a surprisingly accurate description of the shot noise .",
