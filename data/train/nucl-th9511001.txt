    "there has been a revival of the study of the electromagnetic excitation of the baryon resonances , thanks to the advent of the cw electron machines .",
    "current generation of these machines have superior beam quality along with high duty factor .",
    "this , together with good detector technology , has resulted in a vastly improved data base in the first and second resonance regions of the nucleon spectrum . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the interesting tests of qcd involve the @xmath7 evolution of the helicity amplitudes , where @xmath7 is the negative of the virtual photon mass squared .",
    "the real photon point of this evolution curve anchors the non - pertubative domain , which continues till @xmath7 is sufficiently large to have the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) rules set in .",
    "the reaction of interest in this paper is the photoproduction of the eta meson off nucleons : @xmath8 @xmath9 with thresholds @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , where @xmath12 is the lab photon energy .",
    "a large number of recent papers have looked at these reactions both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",
    "a particular interest in this reaction is to study the nucleon to n@xmath2(1535 ) helicity amplitude that dominates this@xcite class of reactions . on the experimental side ,",
    "very high quality experiments have been done at mainz@xcite , while less accurate investigations at bates@xcite and bonn@xcite have also added to our knowledge in this region .",
    "although the theoretical investigations have been principally in the context of quark models , sophistications have been introduced in the framework of these models@xcite making a meaningful comparison between theory and experiment possible .",
    "a particular interest from the theoretical point of view is the extraction of the amplitudes @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the p and n targets respectively to excite the n@xmath2(1535 ) resonance .",
    "granted that we have to deal with model dependence in this extraction from the data , it is of value to see how far this model dependencce can be reduced .    in our analysis , we construct the photoproduction amplitude by using the ela@xcite , which has been very successful in the first@xcite , second@xcite and third@xcite resonance regions .",
    "the main contributions@xcite to the amplitude are the nucleon born term , vector meson exchanges and the excitation of the nucleon resonances , dominated in this case by the n@xmath2(1535 ) resonance .",
    "in contrast to the pion photoproduction , where the pion - nucleon channel couples to a large number of s - channel resonances , the eta - nucleon channel has strong selectivity of the n@xmath2(1535 ) intermediate state .",
    "the dominant amplitude in the n@xmath2(1535 ) excitation region is the @xmath15 amplitude . in table 1 , we show the real part of the @xmath15 amplitude at the threshold of the eta photoproduction , as obtained from our ela fits to the various sets of data . notice the large difference between the @xmath15 amplitude as obtained from our fits to the old data base@xcite and the results inferred from our fits to the photoproduction data obtained at mainz , from the proton@xcite and the neutron@xcite targets , by krusche _",
    "et al._. the latter are not direct measurements , but inferences from the photoproduction off deuteron targets@xcite .",
    "notice the sign difference between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the dominance of the n@xmath2(1535 ) in both of these amplitudes .",
    "this is the basis for our extraction of the electrostrong properties of the n@xmath2(1535 ) excitation off nucleons .",

    "in fig.1 we present a sampling of the angular distributions , as obtained by krusche _",
    "_ for the proton target and the angular distributions for the neutron target as inferred from their data off the deuteron target .",
    "fig.1 , upper pannel , shows our fit to the proton data for parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 for the n@xmath2(1520 ) sector@xcite and the parameter @xmath46 for the vector meson sector@xcite .",
    "fig.1 , lower pannel , incorporates the prediction of the capstick quark model@xcite at the same @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . the quality of fit does not change appreciably when these parameters are varied .",
    "the flatness of the angular distribution at low energy is a direct reflection of the dominance of the @xmath15 amplitude , which , in turn , is dominated by the n@xmath2(1535 ) excitation .",
    "the quality of these comparisons is consistently excellent .",
    "as benmerrouche and mukhopadhyay@xcite first showed , one can reduce the model dependence of the ela in fitting the data by introduction of the parameter @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a kinemetic factor , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the eta - nucleon and total widths of the n@xmath2(1535 ) decay , @xmath55 is the electromagnetic helicity amplitude in the target @xmath56 ( @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) to excite n@xmath2(1535 ) resonance .    in table 2 , we present three different fits in our ela to the mainz proton data to establish the following fact : _ while the extraction of the @xmath13 is model - dependent and is strongly dependent on the choice of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the parameter @xmath0 is not . _ we can repeat this excercise@xcite and show the same to be true for the neutron target .",
    "thus , from the recent mainz data , our ela fits yield the following parameters , which are largely insensitive to the model uncertainties of our ela , also confirmed by similar numbers obtained in a simple breit - wigner fit of the n@xmath2(1535 ) excitation of the @xmath15 multipoles , inferred from the experiment@xcite .",
    "we get @xmath59 @xmath60 yielding the ratio @xmath61 notice that _ all strong interaction effects have dropped out in extracting the last ratio . _ thus , this is a quantity particularly suitable for a direct comparison with the hadron models .    .fitted @xmath13 and inferred @xmath0 for n@xmath2(1535 ) obtained from the new mami data@xcite , along with @xmath62 per degree of freedom , for various analyses .",
    "three rows are fits to the differential cross sections , with different values of strong eta - nucleon widths and resonance parameters .",
    "a and b have n@xmath2(1535 ) amplitude only while c consists of the ela amplitude as described in the text . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we do not have yet any  measurement \" of this ratio or the estimates of the parameters @xmath63 in the lattice qcd approach , but that would be very timely , and welcome .",
    "in the meantime , we can compare the amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath64 with the available quark model results@xcite .",
    "these results are qualitatively ( and some cases quantitatively ) in agreement with our extracted value , but more precision is needed in the fomer to compare with the precision we can get out of the data .",
    "polarization observables are going to be very helpful in futher tests of our extracted parameters .",
    "new facilities like the mainz microtron(mami ) , grenoble light source ( graal ) and the continuous electron beam accelarator facility ( cebaf ) will help these developments in the near future .",
