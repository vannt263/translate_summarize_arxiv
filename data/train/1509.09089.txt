    "object detection is the basis of intelligent video analysis . generally , object recognition , action and behavior recognition , and tracking rely on the detected objects . in a sequence of images ,",
    "there are both moving and static objects . in this paper , the focus is on detecting moving objects in a video .",
    "moving object detection is related to but also different from class - specific object detection and general salient object detection .",
    "pedestrian detection , face detection , and hand detection are instances of class - specific object detection . the task of moving object detection is to detect semantically meaningful moving objects .",
    "predefined classes of moving objects should be detected by a moving object detection algorithm .",
    "moreover , other semantically meaningful objects should also be detected even though their classes are not pre - defined .",
    "examples of meaningless moving objects include water ripples , waving trees ( leafs ) , shadows , noisy data , and the one caused by variations of illumination .",
    "however , the moving object detection algorithm relying merely on motion information is prone to incorrectly classify such meaningless moving objects as meaningful ones .",
    "the corresponding error is called false alarms . but a salient object detection algorithm tends to correctly discard the meaningless objects . hence , in this paper , we propose to incorporate the output ( i.e. , saliency map ) of a salient object algorithm into a subspace analysis based objective function so that the problem of false alarms can be alleviated .",
    "it is noted that our method is also capable of alleviating the problem of missed alarms .",
    "existing moving object detection algorithms tend to classify flat regions ( i.e. , textureless regions ) inside an object and moving regions with similar appearance ( texture ) to background as static background and thus such regions may be missed .",
    "state - of - the - art salient object detection algorithm can output large value of saliency map at such regions . utilizing the saliency map",
    ", our method has ability to classify such regions as foreground . in summary , we present an objective function that unifies subspace analysis of background and saliency map .",
    "the objective function consists of four terms : saliency map , sparsity , connectivity , and low - rank .",
    "an alternative minimization algorithm is proposed to find the optimal solution .",
    "the significant advantage compared to previous subspace based approaches is that saliency map is used to guide the result to have less false and missed alarms .",
    "the proposed method is named modsm .",
    "it is natural that ideal saliency map ( e.g. , the bottom of fig . [ fig.1](a ) and fig . [ fig.1](b ) ) is desirable for the proposed method .",
    "however , even relatively unsatisfying saliency map ( e.g. , the bottom of fig . [ fig.1](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig.1](d ) ) can also play a positive role in the proposed modsam method .",
    "of course , completely bad saliency map has a negative influence on moving object detection .",
    "fortunately , great progress of salient object detection has been achieved @xcite and their fruits can be borrowed for moving object detection .",
    "several methods were developed to employ a salient object detection algorithm for improving the performance of moving object detection @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . despite the initial success",
    ", their performance can not arrive at the level of state - of - the - art low - rank based and subspace based methods @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review related work in section ii .",
    "the proposed method is given in section iii .",
    "experimental results are provided in section iv .",
    "we then conclude in section v.",
    "moving object detection can be implemented by different manners : detecting followed by tracking@xcite , subtracting frames@xcite , modeling background by density function , modeling background by subspace , modeling background by low - rank matrix .",
    "the last two manners dominate the state - of - the - art methods and are closely related to our work .",
    "note that moving object detection methods can also be divided into incremental methods and batch methods .",
    "our method belongs to incremental one . *",
    "subtracting frames * this kind of methods detects moving objects based on the differences between adjacent frames @xcite , @xcite .",
    "but these methods were proved not robust against illumination variations , changing background , camera motion , and noise .    * modeling background by density function * this strategy assumes that the background is stationary and can be modeled by gaussian , mixture of gaussians , or dirichlet process mixture models @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the foreground ( moving objects )",
    "can then be obtained by subtracting the current frame with the background model .",
    "* modeling background by subspace * instead of using a density function , subspace based method models the background as a linear combination the bases of a subspace @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "because the subspace can be updated in an incremental ( online ) manner , its efficiency is very high .",
    "this kind of subspace based algorithms needs to impose constraints on the foreground in order to obtain valid solutions .",
    "foreground sparsity is one of the widely used constraints which implies that the area of moving objects is small relative to the background .",
    "principal component prusuit ( pcp ) @xcite is an important pioneer work which adopts norm for measuring the foreground sparsity .",
    "it is the constraint of foreground sparsity that makes pcp suitable for foreground - background separation . without this constraint ,",
    "traditional robust subspace methods can only deal with noise and outliers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the method @xcite improves pcp by taking into account the foreground connectivity ( i.e. , foreground structure ) .",
    "rfdsa takes into account smoothness and arbitrariness constraints @xcite .",
    "but pcp @xcite , rfdsa@xcite , and the method @xcite are batch algorithms .",
    "its detection speed can not arrive at real - time level .",
    "therefore , incremental ( online ) subspace methods are crucial for real - time detection @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed an online subspace tracking algorithm called grasta ( grassmannian robust adaptive subspace tracking algorithm ) .",
    "similar to pcp , grasta also explores norm for imposing sparsity on foreground .",
    "but the grasta algorithm does not utilize any connectivity ( a.k.a . ,",
    "smoothness ) property of foreground .",
    "the gosus ( grassmannian online subspace updates with structured - sparsity ) algorithm @xcite imposes a connectivity constraint on the objective function by grouping the pixels with a superpixel method and encouraging sparsity of the groups . because of the large computational cost of the superpixel algorithm @xcite , gosus is not as efficient as grasta .    * modeling background by low - rank matrix low - rank modeling * is effective in video representation @xcite . a sequence of vectorized images is represented as a matrix and the matrix is approximated by the sum of matrices of vectorized foreground , background , and noise @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the background matrix is low - rank .",
    "decolor ( detecting contiguous outliers in the low - rank representation ) @xcite is considered as one of the most successful low - rank based algorithms . in decolor ,",
    "both foreground sparsity and contiguity ( connectivity ) are taken into account .",
    "it can be interpreted as -penalty regularized rpca @xcite .",
    "but the matrix computation can be started only if all of the predefined number of successive images is available .",
    "obviously , such a batch method is not suitable for real - time video analysis due to its low efficiency .",
    "isc @xcite and corola @xcite are incremental versions of decolor .",
    "isc and corola transforms low - rank method to subspace one .",
    "the low - rank methods and subspace methods impose sparsity and connectivity ( a.k.a . ,",
    "smoothness ) on foreground and impose low - rank or principal components on background .",
    "in addition to such properties , in this paper we propose to impose saliency map on background and foreground meanwhile .",
    "the proposed method belongs to incremental subspace based moving object detection method .",
    "our main contribution lies in employing a saliency map to form a new objective function , resulting in fewer false and missed alarms .",
    "the input of the algorithm is a sequence of frames ( images ) .",
    "denote @xmath0 the current image and denote @xmath1 the @xmath2-th pixel of @xmath3 .",
    "there are @xmath4 pixels in an image .",
    "the goal is to find the locations of the moving objects ( i.e. , foreground ) in the current image @xmath3 .",
    "the foreground locations are represented by a foreground - indicator vector @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath2-element @xmath6 of @xmath7 equals to either zero or one :    @xmath8    the foreground - indicator vector @xmath9 is obtained by binarizing background vector @xmath10 with a threshold @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath2-element of @xmath14 .",
    "the possibility of pixel @xmath2 being background increases with the value of @xmath13 and the possibility of pixel @xmath2 being foreground decreases with the increasing value of @xmath13 .      as stated above ( i.e. , eq . ( [ eq.1 ] ) and eq .",

    "<S> moving object detection is a key to intelligent video analysis . on the one hand , what moves is not only interesting objects but also noise and cluttered background . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , moving objects without rich texture are prone not to be detected . </S>",
    "<S> so there are undesirable false alarms and missed alarms in many algorithms of moving object detection . to reduce the false alarms and missed alarms , in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose to incorporate a saliency map into an incremental subspace analysis framework where the saliency map makes estimated background has less chance than foreground ( i.e. , moving objects ) to contain salient objects . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed objective function systematically takes account into the properties of sparsity , low - rank , connectivity , and saliency . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative minimization algorithm is proposed to seek the optimal solutions . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results on the perception test images sequences demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in reducing false alarms and missed alarms . </S>"
