    "despite extensive imaging surveys ( e.g. oppenheimer et al . 2000 ) , only three brown dwarfs were confirmed so far by both spectroscopy and proper motion as companions to normal stars : gl  229  b ( nakajima et al . 1995 , oppenheimer et al . 1995 ) , g  196 - 3  b ( rebolo et al . 1998 ) , and gl  570  d ( burgasser et al . 2000 ) .",
    "a few more candidates were presented , gg  tau  bb ( white et al . 1999 ) , cod@xmath2  b ( lowrance et al . 1999 , henceforth l99 ; webb et al .",
    "1999 , w99 ) , and hr  7329  b ( lowrance et al . 2000 ) , but either spectroscopy or proper motions were not available .",
    "brown dwarfs and l - dwarfs can also have companions ( basri & martn 1999 , martn et al .",
    "radial velocity surveys yielded a large number of planet candidates , but only few brown dwarfs are among them , e.g. hd 10697 ( zucker & mazeh 2000 ) .    because young objects are still relatively luminous due to ongoing accretion and/or contraction ( burrows et al .",
    "1997 , brandner et al .",
    "1997 , malkov et al .",
    "1998 ) , imaging surveys for sub - stellar objects in star forming regions or as companions to isolated young nearby stars should be more fruitful .",
    "e.g. , l99 and w99 found a faint object called cod@xmath2  b just @xmath10 north of the isolated m1.5-type t tauri star cod@xmath2  a ( gregorio - hetem et al .",
    "1992 ) , a kinematic member of the nearby tw hya association ( twa , see kastner et al .",
    "the hipparcos satellite obtained the parallaxes of four out of 14 twa members , so that we can assume the mean distance of those four stars for the other stars not observed by hipparcos ( including cod@xmath2  a ) , namely @xmath11 pc .",
    "the companion candidate cod@xmath2  b is @xmath1 mag fainter than the primary star in the infrared , and its ihjk colors are consistent with spectral type m8 to m8.5 ( l99 , w99 ) .",
    "based on its colors , its small separation from cod@xmath2  a , and its galactic latitude , it was concluded that this object could well be a brown dwarf companion , but neither a spectrum nor the proper motion were available for corroboration .",
    "weintraub et al . ( 2000 ) presented additional hst nicmos narrow - band filter photometry , also consistent with a young late m - type brown dwarf , but the epoch difference ( 0.2 yrs ) between their and previous images were not sufficient for obtaining the proper motion of cod@xmath2  b.",
    "an optical spectrum of cod@xmath2  b was obtained with the focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph 2 ( fors2 ) at the european southern observatory ( eso ) 8.2 m telescope kueyen , unit telescope 2 ( ut2 ) of the very large telescope ( vlt ) . the 30 min exposure spectrum in the",
    "6000 to 9000   range ( r=680 ) using grism 300i and order separation filter og590 was taken during a technical night on 23 feb 2000 .",
    "the @xmath12 slit was positioned just on object b in e - w direction .",
    "standard data reduction was done with midas .",
    "the final spectrum is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the spectral type of cod@xmath2  b is m8.5 to m9 according to different spectral indices ( see also kirkpatrick et al .",
    "the equivalent width of the h@xmath4 emission is @xmath13 , stronger than in old m8-m9 dwarfs .",
    "the na i doublet line at 8183 and 8195  is slightly weaker than in the standards , which is indicative of low gravity ( kirkpatrick et al . 1991 ) .",
    "both the strong h@xmath4 emission and the weak na absorption indicate a young age .",
    "the spectral resolution is too low to split the na i doublet or to resolve the li 6708  line ( next to the tio 6713  and ca 6718  lines ) .",
    "an h - band spectrum ( r@xmath14 ) was obtained on 16 apr 2000 with the infrared spectrograph and array camera ( isaac ) at the eso 8.2 m telescope antu ( vlt - ut1 ) .",
    "the spectrum consists of 20 co - added 60s exposures through a @xmath15 slit , aligned neither along the position angle of the pair nor perpendicular to it , but in between those two positions , so that the two objects are well separated and that the flux from the companion candidate is several times larger than the flux from the bright star .",
    "after standard data reduction , we modelled and subtracted the flux of the bright star from the faint object s spectrum at each wavelength .",
    "mainly due to the slope of the continuum ( figure 2 ) , cod@xmath2  b has spectral type m8.5 to m9 , consistent with the ihjk colors ( l99 and w99 ) .",
    "recently , schneider et al . ( 2000 ) presented an hst / stis spectrum of cod@xmath2  b , which is in good agreement with our results .",
    "cod@xmath2  b was detected by l99 using hst nicmos on 25 apr 1998 in the f160w filter , located @xmath16 west and @xmath17 north of cod@xmath2  a , corresponding to a separation of @xmath18 and a position angle of @xmath19 . on 12 jul 1998 , weintraub et al .",
    "( 2000 ) detected the faint object , also using hst nicmos , but with narrow band filters , located @xmath20 west and @xmath21 north of the bright star , corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the precision in weintraub et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is higher than in l99 , because the latter used the coronograph that makes it difficult to determine the centroid .",
    "we present two new images of cod@xmath2  b : a 1s exposure fors2 i - band image taken during a technical night on 21 feb 2000 with the high resolution collimator ( @xmath24/pixel ) and a 2s exposure isaac acquisition image ( @xmath25/pixel ) taken on 16 apr 2000 through a narrow band filter centered on @xmath26 m ( @xmath27 m ) . in both images ,",
    "the central pixels of the bright star are saturated , which makes it difficult to determine the centroid ; we fitted isophots in the unsaturated part of the psf .",
    "the fwhm of the faint object on the fors2 image is only @xmath5 , so that this image may well be the sharpest optical image ever taken from the ground ( figure 3a ) .    in the fors2 image",
    ", the companion candidate is located @xmath28 west and @xmath29 north of the bright star , corresponding to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and in the isaac image , the companion candidate is located @xmath32 west and @xmath33 north of the bright star , corresponding to @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the errors include uncertainties in the north - south alignment .    in figure 3b , we plot the four positions of the companion candidate b with respect to star a with their error ellipses .",
    "if the error ellipses are disjunct by more than expected for orbital motion ( @xmath36 mas / yr , see below ) , object b could not be a co - moving companion .",
    "if the error ellipses do overlap , this does not prove object b to be a companion . whether we can already show that the motion of cod@xmath2  b relative to a is inconsistent with b being an unrelated field star , depends on the proper motion of star a. the proper motion was published by w99 . in the tycho catalog ( hg et al .",
    "2000 ) , we found @xmath37 and @xmath38 mas / yr .    in figure 3c , we plot star a first on 25 apr 1998 at @xmath39 , then on 12 jul 1998 south - west of it as given by its proper motion , and then on 21 feb and 16 apr 2000 even more south - west ; the errors in the 2nd to 4th epoch locations are given by the error of the proper motion .",
    "in addition , we plot the offset of object b relative to star a with errors given by the errors of the measured offsets and the proper motion of star a. object b is clearly co - moving with star a. if object b would be an unrelated field object , it should not be co - moving with a , but either be a non - moving background object or a foreground object with different motion ( different parallactic motion would be negligible , even if unrelated , because the epoch difference between the hst and vlt images is close to an integer number of years ) .",
    "the error ellipses do not overlap .",
    "the proper motions of a and b are similar , namely by @xmath40 regarding their amount and by @xmath41 regarding their direction .",
    "hence , we have in total a @xmath42 significance for the pair being a common proper motion pair .",
    "based on its spectral type and magnitude ( h@xmath43 mag , l99 ) , cod@xmath2  b would be located at @xmath44 pc , if it would be main - sequence dwarf ( m@xmath45 mag , kirkpatrick & mccarthy 1994 ) . from the six objects with m@xmath46 mag found within 5 pc around the sun",
    ", we can estimate the probability for chance alignment of cod@xmath2  b within @xmath47 around star a to be @xmath9 . given the very sparse space density of t tauri stars in the twa region , the probability for cod@xmath2  b to be a free - floating young twa brown dwarf , unrelated to star a ,",
    "is of the same order .",
    "thus , there is a high probability that component b is a physical companion to star a.    cod@xmath2  a is a spectroscopic binary ( w99 ) . for an equal - mass binary at @xmath3 pc ,",
    "the age is @xmath48 myrs ( weintraub et al .",
    "we can assume the same age for its companion .",
    "hence , for its young age and spectral type , cod@xmath2  b is below the sub - stellar limit according to different sets of tracks and isochrones ( e.g. baraffe et al .",
    "hence , it is a brown dwarf .",
    "the mass of each component in the spectroscopic binary cod@xmath2  a , assuming that both components have equal masses , is @xmath49  m@xmath50 ( weintraub et al .",
    "2000 using baraffe et al .",
    "1998 tracks ) .",
    "thus , the separation @xmath51 at @xmath11 pc distance corresponds to a projected separation of @xmath52  au and to an orbital period of @xmath53  yrs . assuming a circular orbit viewed pole - on",
    ", we expect @xmath36 mas / yr orbital motion .",
    "the location of object b relative to star a in the fors2 image is @xmath54 deviant from the hst images ( figure 3b ) : object b lies @xmath55 west of star a. this can be interpreted as first indication for orbital motion after the two year epoch difference .",
    "the alternative interpretation that object b is a fast moving foreground star , is extremly unlikely ( see above ) .",
    "if this slight deviation indeed is orbital motion , the inclination is not edge - on , because we see motion in the plane of the sky . given the good seeing and image quality at the vlt , the errors in the location of object b relative to star a should improve , if one can obtain unsaturated images .",
    "then , one can detect curvature in the orbit within a few years",
    ".    given the young age and spectral type m8.5 to m9 of cod@xmath2  b , its effective temperature  using the scale intermediate between giant and dwarfs provided by luhman ( 1999 ) ",
    "is @xmath56  k , where the error comes from the error in the luhman scale and the spectral type ( @xmath57 sub - types ) .",
    "this results in a bolometric luminosity of @xmath58 ( l@xmath59l@xmath60 ( using b.c.@xmath61 mag ) .    comparing these numbers with theoretical models",
    ", we can estimate its mass : from the burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 ) models , we obtain @xmath62  m@xmath8 . according to baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the object is located on the 10 myrs isochrone ( co - eval with the primary ) with a mass of @xmath63  m@xmath8 . with the new chabrier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) models , the companion has a mass of @xmath64  m@xmath8 for an age of 1 to 20 myrs .",
    "overall , a range of @xmath7 to 40  m@xmath8 is reasonable .",
    "all those models , however , are uncertain at the young age of our object .",
    "because cod@xmath2  a is a spectroscopic binary and because it may soon be possible to detect orbital motion of the companion brown dwarf , masses and/or mass ratios might be determined soon .",
    "finally , all three objects should be co - eval , so that this triple system will be a good test case for theoretical evolutionary tracks and isochrones ."
