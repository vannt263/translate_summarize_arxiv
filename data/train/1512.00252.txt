    "gaussian states play a prominent roles in cv quantum information @xcite .",
    "however , many quantum technological protocols , such as entanglement distillation @xcite or quantum error correction @xcite , necessarily require the use of non - gaussian state , which can extract ultimate potential of quantum information theory unaccessible by the gaussian states",
    ". with the increasing significance of non - gaussian states , the issues of generating non - gaussian states have been naturally arisen .",
    "it is well - known that the non - gaussian states must exhibit non - gaussian features in their wigner distributions in the phase space @xcite and gererating non - gaussian states normally requires nonlinearities in the field operators @xcite . in order to obtain non - gaussian states , there is an alternative idea of measurement - induced scheme ( also the conditional probabilistic operation ) to obtain nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "some effective nonlinearity @xcite is associated with non - gaussian measurement such as homodyne measurements or photon countings @xcite based on a linear quantum - optical system 23 , which generally consist of beam splitting , phase shifting , squeezing , displacement , and various detection @xcite .",

    "this state was generated in one of the bs output channels if a coherent state @xmath1 and a single - photon fock state @xmath2 are present in two input ports and a single photon is registered in the other bs output .",
    "they called this transformation as quantum - optical catalysis  because the single photon itself remains unaffected but facilitates the conversion of the target ensemble . following lvovsky and mlynek s work and using quantum - optical catalysis , bartley _",
    "_ further generated multiphoton nonclassical states via interference between coherent and fock states , which exhibit a wide range of nonclassical phenomena @xcite .",
    "indeed , the key step in bartley s scheme is to employ quantum - optical catalysis  on the input coherent state one time .",
    "recently , we operated quantum - optical catalysis  on each mode of the two - mode squeezed vacuum state and generated a non - gaussian two - mode quantum state with higher entanglement , accompanied by a nonlinear operator @xmath3 @xcite",
    ". enlighten by above works , we further consider the following problem : if we perform quantum - optical catalysis  on a coherent state two times , then what states will be generated and what nonclassical phenomena will happen ? this is the kernal focus of our work .    in 2000 , knill , laflamme , and milburn ( klm ) implemented a nonlinear sign ( ns ) change using a optical network composed of three beam splitters in succession , whose main features are the use of two ancilla modes with one prepared photon and post - selection based on measuring the ancillas @xcite . because of the su(3 )",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly outline the klm - type su(3 ) interferometry and introduce the measurement - induced scheme for generating nonclassical states . in particular , the normalization factor ( i.e. success probability ) is discussed . in section iii , we investigate the nonclassical properties ( anti - bunching effect and squeezing effect ) of the generated state  and analyze the effect of the interaction . then in section iv we consider the negativity of the wigner function , another nonclassical indication for a quantum state .",
