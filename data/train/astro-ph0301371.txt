    "given the increase in density of sources that we find in this field toward   ( see section [ sec : spat ] ) and the size of the psf as a function of field offset angle , there is a 1% chance that a second source will lie within one - half the radius of the psf for any given source near , declining to 0.1% at large field offset angles . finally , we manually removed a few dozen sources that were obviously part of extended , filamentary x - ray features .    with the above method",

    "since the absorption column toward the galactic center is very high ( @xmath28 @xmath6 of h ; see * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : norm_dnds ] , we plot both the cumulative and the differential number counts as a function of flux for sources at the galactic center ( filled circles ) and in the foreground ( open circles ) , normalized to the solid angle of the survey @xmath72 in units of arcmin@xmath71 .",
    "we have been conservative in our source selection to avoid incompleteness in our sample caused by the varying sensitivity over our image ( figure  [ fig : fluxlim ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab : surveys ] lists the criteria used to select sources for this distribution .",
    "first , sources in a given flux range are required to lie within a maximum field offset angle .",
    "this criterion accounts for the increasing psf size with field offset , which causes our sensitivity to decrease .",
    "second , the @xmath58 flux limit derived from equation  [ eq : fluxlim ] at the position of each source is required to be smaller than the value in table  [ tab : surveys ] for that field offset angle .",
    "this excludes regions of high background , detector chip gaps , and bad ccd columns .",
    "the solid angles over which sources from each flux limit are acceptable are listed in table  [ tab : surveys ] , as well as the number of sources accepted in each flux range .",
    "note that only about one - third of both the foreground and galactic center sources detected in our image satisfy the above selection criteria , since the high background in the image adds significant uncertainty to our flux measurements .",
    "the @xmath73 distribution is constructed from the number of sources in a flux interval @xmath74 , divided by the size of the flux interval @xmath75 , divided by the solid angle of the survey at that flux .",
    "the flux interval is computed in units of @xmath27 photons @xmath6 s@xmath1 .",
    "finally , since the surface density of galactic center sources decreases with increasing field offset , we normalized the numbers of hard sources in each flux range to the mean surface density in the largest 9  survey area .",
    "the cumulative distribution @xmath76 is simply the integral of the differential distribution .    using the un - binned flux values , we modeled the @xmath77 distributions using the maximum likelihood technique described in @xcite .",
    "the galactic center sources were not consistent with a single power - law distribution of the form @xmath78 therefore , guided roughly by the differential counts in figure  [ fig : norm_dnds ] , we divided the distribution into two flux ranges , less than and greater than @xmath79 photons @xmath6 s@xmath1 .",
    "these regions were consistent with power laws of the forms @xmath80 where @xmath45 is in units of photons @xmath6 s@xmath1 , and the normalization is in units of sources arcmin@xmath71 .",
    "the normalizations of each model distribution are set to the mean value that would be expected over the full 9  survey area , given that the observed stellar density falls off approximately as @xmath81 .",
    "we take equation  [ eq : mod ] as a rough approximation of the @xmath82 distribution of the galactic center sources .",
    "since the surface density of hard sources is strongly peaked at the galactic center , it is reasonable to assume that most of them are within the nuclear bulge and hence at the same distance , @xmath83 kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section  3.1 ) . as a result , if the photon fluxes can be converted to unabsorbed energy fluxes , this cumulative number  flux distribution would represent the intrinsic luminosity distribution of the sources . unfortunately , the absorption varies significantly from source to source , so significant uncertainties would be introduced in converting this to a luminosity distribution .",
    "moreover , the physical meaning of the slopes of the distributions is at the moment unclear , since we have not yet identified the nature of the sources .",
    "therefore , we have made no attempt to match the normalizations of these two model distributions exactly , nor did we attempt to derive more rigorously the position of the break in the distribution .",
    "the flux distribution of the foreground sources in figure  [ fig : norm_dnds ] ( open circles ) was similarly modeled . only the soft band ( 0.52.0  kev )",
    "was used in computing the flux , since this minimizes the background .",
    "the power law determined from the maximum likelihood technique was @xmath84 where @xmath45 is again in photons @xmath6 s@xmath1 , and the normalization is sources arcmin@xmath71 .",
    "this distribution is much flatter than that at the galactic center .      despite the large number of sources in this image",
    ", we are still far from being confusion - limited .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that for steep ( @xmath85 ) number count distribution , fewer than 10% of sources will be affected by confusion if there are fewer than one source per 50 `` beams '' . here",
    ", a beam is defined to have an area @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the full - width half - maximum of the psf . in the inner 1  of the image in figure  [ fig : rawimage ] ,",
    "there are 13 sources arcmin@xmath71 with fluxes higher than @xmath64 photons @xmath6 s@xmath1  ( equation  [ eq : rad ] ) .",
    "since @xmath87 for _ chandra_is only 05 near the aim point , there is approximately once source per 2000 beams in the densest part of our image .",
    "the confusion limit will not be reached until the surface density increases by a factor of 40 . from equation  [ eq : mod ]",
    ", we would have to observe to a completeness limit a factor of 9 lower in order for confusion to be important . on the other hand , at an offset of 8from the aim point , the spatial density of sources is 1.7 per arcmin ( equation  [ eq : rad ] ) , and    @xmath88 , which implies that there is one source per 200 beams .",
    "thus , the outer edges of the image will become confusion limited if our completeness limit reaches a factor of 2 lower .",
    "therefore , both the photometry and the positions of the x - ray sources in this sample are reliable over the entire image .",
    "we used the counts in each energy band to compute three hardness ratios , which we used to characterize the absorption column toward each source and the steepness of the high - energy portion of each spectrum .",
    "the ratios are defined as the fractional difference between the count rates in two energy bands , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the numbers of counts in the higher and lower energy bands , respectively .",
    "the resulting ratio is bounded by @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the soft color is defined by the fractional difference between counts with energies between 2.03.3  kev    and 0.52.0  kev ; the medium color using counts with energies between 3.34.7  kev and 2.03.3  kev , and the hard color using counts between 4.78.0  kev and 3.34.7  kev .",

    "the foreground sources tend to have lower soft colors than the galactic center sources , indicating more photons are received at low energies .",
    "relatively few galactic center sources are detected with 90% confidence in the 0.52.0  kev band by definition , so the soft colors have limited usefulness . the medium and hard colors",
    "provide more information about galactic center sources .",
    "we have calculated the hardness ratios that we would expect to get from these energy bands for a variety of spectra using .",
    "variations in the soft color are dominated by differences in the absorption column toward the source , although we find that sources with column densities greater than @xmath94 @xmath6 would have too few counts to be detected reliably below 2  kev .",
    "the hard color is determined almost exclusively by the temperature or steepness of the spectrum above 4  kev , as long as the absorbing column is less than about @xmath95  @xmath6 of h. the medium color is affected by both the absorbing column and the intrinsic spectral shape . in order to examine the spectra",
    "further , in figure  [ fig : cc ] we compare the medium and hard colors of the point sources with those expected from a set of simulated absorbed power - law spectra ( of the form @xmath9 ) .",
    "we have indicated galactic center sources by filled circles , and foreground sources with open circles .",
    "all sources detected with 90% confidence in the three energy bands above 2  kev are included in the plot , which amounts to 785 galactic center sources and 39 foreground sources .",
    "about half of the galactic center sources cluster in a region consistent with absorption columns @xmath96 , and very flat spectra with photon indices @xmath10 ( where negative values indicate rising numbers of photons with energy ) .",
    "such hard spectra are unusual for x - ray point sources ( see table  [ tab : ps ] ) .",
    "simulations with indicate that the thermal models expected for many of the classes of sources in table  [ tab : ps ]  e.g. ionized plasma with @xmath97  kev , blackbodies with @xmath98  kev , or bremsstrahlung emission with @xmath99  kev  all produce hard colors less than 0.1 .",
    "we have confirmed that the x - ray spectra of most of the galactic center sources are intrinsically hard ( as opposed to resulting only from high absorption ) using the spectral fits reported in the next section .",

    "the models consisted of a blackbody , bremsstrahlung , or power - law continuum multiplied by    factors to account for interstellar absorption with column density @xmath101 and dust scattering with optical depth @xmath102 .",
    "the column depth of dust was set to @xmath103 @xcite , and the halo size to 100 times the psf size .",
    "we found that most of the sources that we modeled , 436 of 565 , could be adequately fit ( at least a 10% chance of exceeding the observed @xmath67 randomly ) with an absorbed power law .",
    "the power - law models were not adequate for brighter sources with strong line emission , and for very soft sources .",
    "the bremsstrahlung and blackbody models succeeded only slightly less often , but more than half the time the temperatures obtained were extremely hot ( @xmath104  kev for bremsstrahlung or @xmath105  kev for blackbodies ) .",
    "a full exploration of the spectra of the point sources is beyond the scope of the current paper , but these preliminary spectral fits do confirm the results from our analysis of hardness ratios .",
    "four example spectra with a range of photon indices are displayed in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",

    "_ panel b _ exhibits a foreground source , which can be identified by its copious emission below 2  kev .",
    "this spectrum is adequately modeled with a power law of photon index @xmath108 , and has a hard color of @xmath109 . _",
    "panels c _ and _ d _ illustrate spectra from two very hard sources that have best - fit power laws of slope @xmath110 ( hard color 0.16 ) and @xmath111 ( hard color 0.57 ) , respectively .",
    "visual inspection confirms the hardness of the spectra , because these sources have as much or more flux above 5  kev than the other two sources , but less flux between 3.34.7  kev .",
    "the source in _ panel d _ also exhibits copious iron emission , so that the power law fit to this source is statistically unacceptable . including a line of equivalent width 0.8  kev at 6.9  kev produces an acceptable fit , and increases the photon index to @xmath112 .",
    "we conclude that hard colors @xmath113 in figure  [ fig : cc ] reflect either spectra with photon indices @xmath10 ( e.g. figure  [ fig : spec ] _",

    "these soft sources are distributed uniformly over the field ( figure  [ fig : spatial ] ) , as would be expected if they lie in the galactic disk . however , the density of soft sources in this field is lower than that of @xcite , who detected 183 soft sources down to a limiting flux of @xmath123 erg @xmath6 s@xmath1  in a 250 arcmin@xmath124 field at @xmath125",

    "<S> we present a catalog of 2357 point sources detected during 590 ks of _ chandra _  observations of the 17-by-17 arcminute field around . </S>",

    "<S> the completeness limit of the sample at the galactic center is @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 ( 2.08.0 kev ) , while the detection limit is an order of magnitude lower . </S>",
    "<S> the 281 sources detected below 1.5 kev are mainly in the foreground of the galactic center , while comparisons to the _ chandra _  deep fields at high galactic latitudes suggest that only about 100 of the observed sources are background agn . </S>",
    "<S> the surface density of absorbed sources ( not detected below 1.5  kev ) falls off as @xmath2 away from , in agreement with the distribution of stars in infrared surveys . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the x - ray sources trace the general stellar population at the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> point sources brighter than our completeness limit produce 10% of the flux previously attributed to diffuse emission . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 distribution of the galactic center sources is extremely steep ( power - law slope @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if this distribution extends down to a flux of @xmath5 erg @xmath6 s@xmath1   ( @xmath7 erg s@xmath1  at 8  kpc , 2.08.0  kev ) with the same slope , then point sources would account for all of the previously reported diffuse emission . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are numerous diffuse , filamentary structures in the field that also contribute to the total flux , so the 2.08.0 kev luminosity distribution must flatten between @xmath8 erg s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> many types of stellar systems should be present in the field at the luminosities to which we are sensitive . however , the spectra of more than half of the galactic center sources are very hard , and can be described by a power law ( @xmath9 ) with photon index @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> such hard spectra have been seen previously only from magnetically accreting white dwarfs ( polars and intermediate polars ) and wind - accreting neutron stars ( pulsars ) , suggesting that there are large numbers of these systems in our field . </S>"
