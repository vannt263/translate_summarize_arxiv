    "our data consist of polarization position angle ( e - field ) , percentage polarization , and total flux at @xmath0 for 3c 273 for each night of ut 10 , 12 - 18 february 1988 . the data for a representative night ( 12 feb .",
    ") are shown in figure 1 , where the solid lines represent the best - fitting model for that night ( see  2 ) .",
    "the data were taken at ukirt with the mark ii hatfield polarimeter ( hough , peacock , & bailey 1991 ) , which makes simultaneous optical and near - infrared observations , important for this variable blazar .",
    "the data have been corrected for interstellar polarization and galactic extinction .",
    "a brief discussion of these data was presented by wills ( 1991 ) .    at the time of our observations",
    "3c 273 was in an outburst state ( courvoisier et al .",
    "this outburst has since been associated with the ejection of vlbi component c9 ( @xmath1 , bth et al .",
    "1991 ) . at this time",
    "the polarization was higher than usual .    in our data both the percentage polarization and the position angle are very frequency - dependent , and this dependence changes from night to night .",
    "the frequency dependence of @xmath2 , particularly a 90  flip on 14 feb .",
    ", is suggestive of the presence of two perpendicular polarized components of similar amplitude but different spectral shape .",
    "we have modelled our data with two power laws in polarized flux density that vary from night to night in amplitude , spectral index , and position angle .",
    "the addition of two such components for 12 feb . is illustrated in figure 2 . in all cases",
    "we find that the two components are approximately perpendicular , with the e - vector of the steeper component transverse to the projected jet direction .",
    "the model reproduces the data well .",
    "slight changes in the model parameters ( for example , @xmath33@xmath4 in position angle , @xmath30.05 in spectral index , and @xmath30.05 mjy in amplitude ) produce noticeably worse fits to the data .",
    "the two - component models are thus well - constrained by the data .",
    "we find that the components are correlated in amplitude and position angle , and probably spectral index ( significance levels of @xmath599.75% , @xmath599% , and @xmath593% respectively ) with a time lag of much less than one day .",
    "the changes of the amplitudes and position angles of the components with time are illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "we explain the polarization of 3c 273 in outburst with two synchrotron components . since these components are nearly perpendicular they tend to cancel each other out , resulting in low polarized flux .",
    "this blazar - like polarization is further diluted by a strong , unpolarized non - blazar continuum , resulting in the low observed percentage polarization for this object .",
    "the outburst emission of blazars is often explained in terms of a shocked jet model like that of marscher & gear ( 1985 ) .",
    "such models normally involve a quiescent component and a shock component . we instead require two components associated with the shock",
    ". these components must be nearly co - spatial to account for the very short time lag between their polarizations .",
    "the simplest model would involve an underlying magnetic field that is parallel to the jet , but which is compressed so as to be perpendicular in the region of the shock .",
    "one of our components , which has polarization parallel to the jet and a flatter spectrum , would originate from the region of the perpendicular b - field , as expected from the marscher & gear model .",
    "the other component , with perpendicular polarization , would be due to high energy electrons that have leaked from the shocked region and are accelerated where the b - field is parallel to the jet .",
    "we see these two components superimposed .",
