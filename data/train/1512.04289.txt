    "one of fundamental aspects of the graphene physics is the electronic band dispersion which is linear @xmath4 in the vicinity of the dirac points for a wide region of energy @xmath5 ( @xmath6 1 ev ) ;  @xcite here @xmath7 cm / s is the fermi velocity in graphene , @xmath8 is the electron momentum , and @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the electro - physical properties essentially determined by the energy band structure will be different for graphene and conventional semiconductors with the standard energy band ( ge , si , gaas , etc ) .",
    "@xcite    a lot of attention has been paid to the investigation of the electrical conductivity in graphene both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "a special focus is given to the investigation of electron dynamic response to electrical perturbations which can be varying in both space and time .",
    "@xcite generally , spatial dispersion for arbitrary wave vectors should be included in the description of the dynamic conductivity which , in this case , due to the existence of preferential direction given by the wave vector @xmath10 is a tensorial quantity , @xmath0 , the dynamic conductivity tensor ( dct ) .",
    "the detailed knowledge of wave - vector dispersion of dct is critically important for use in tunable thz plasmonic and metamaterial nanodevices based on excitation modes in different graphene structures.@xcite the examples are patterned structures such as periodic micro - ribbon arrays ,  @xcite antidots arrays ,  @xcite grating - gated graphene - based hemts ,  @xcite and other semiconductor plasmonic systems .",
    "@xcite also , a scheme which avoids patterning has been proposed for coupling light into graphene plasmons by forming a tunable optical grating with electrically generated surface acoustic waves .",
    "@xcite recently , the novel nanoscope techniques have been developed where electric fields ( variable in time and space ) can be excited at the length scale of the order of tens of nanometers , as well as the methods which allow to explore the excited fields and plasmons on these time and length scales , including ultrafast resonance of dirac plasmons in graphene and similar systems .",
    "@xcite another important feature associated with the wave - vector dispersion in such systems is that the wave vector @xmath10 and vector of the locally excited field are not parallel as it takes place , for example , in the case of electrostatic perturbation , where they are always collinear according to the poisson equation .    since the discovery of graphene ,  @xcite the behavior of dirac quasiparticles in external electric fields is the subject of intense theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "such studies are stimulated by both the exceptional electronic properties of graphene  @xcite and the perspective of various ultrahigh - speed applications in future integrated - circuit technology ,  @xcite high - frequency electronics including terahertz ( thz ) frequencies ,  @xcite and optoelectronics .",
    "@xcite in early research , most transport studies in graphene have been carried out under low - bias conditions to probe the intrinsic electronic properties , although high - field behavior of the nonequilibrium carriers is more appropriate for practical graphene - based device operation .",
    "@xcite the wave - vector @xmath1 and frequency @xmath11 dispersion of the graphene dct @xmath0 was considered in the collisionless regime  @xcite and in the relaxation - time approximation  @xcite for a weak electric field , which did not break the equilibrium distribution of dirac quasiparticles over energy in the bands . in the high - field limit ,",
    "the charged carrier transport is described , in particular , in terms of the hot electrons and/or holes in graphene .",
    "@xcite    in a general case of arbitrary wave vector @xmath1 and frequency @xmath11 , the dispersion of dct becomes important for such @xmath1 and @xmath11 which obey the inequalities @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the carrier band velocity and the momentum relaxation time , respectively ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the collisionless limit corresponds to the conditions @xmath18 which imply many oscillations of the ac field on the space and time scales given by the carrier mean free path @xmath19 and the characteristic time @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "these allow to neglect a small collision integral , compared to the rest of terms in the boltzmann kinetic equation , and to calculate the dct , @xmath0 , in the straightforward manner . in this regime ,",
    "the space and time dispersion results from the fact that _ free movement _ of the carriers is affected by all values of the ac field along the trajectories of movement rather than its local and instantaneous value .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate theoretically the space and time dispersion of dct of dirac quasiparticles in the doped single - layer graphene system under a high dc electric field . for generality",
    ", we consider the perturbing ac field to be of arbitrary configuration , that is the electric field vector and the wave vector @xmath10 are treated as the two independent vectors .",
    "the theoretical model is based on the semiclassical approach which is valid for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fermi wave vector and energy , respectively .",
    "the latter inequality allows us to exclude the interband transitions between the valence and conduction bands which assumes frequency @xmath24 .    the specific behavior of real , @xmath25 , and imaginary , @xmath26 , parts of the complex dct @xmath27 is tightly connected to the well - known kinematic resonance in the collisionless plasma .",
    "@xcite at the resonance @xmath28 , the phase velocity of the wave in the direction of propagation @xmath29 is equal to the carrier velocity @xmath30 . for graphene , due to the linear energy spectrum , the resonance is determined by _ a linear _ dependence of frequency on wave vector , @xmath31 , which is to some extent similar to the dirac cone @xmath32 ; here @xmath33 is the dirac quasiparticle wave vector and @xmath34 .",
    "we will show that for high frequencies @xmath35 [ fast waves , @xmath36 the real part of dct becomes equal to zero . in the region of low frequencies @xmath37 [ slow waves , @xmath38 , the space dispersion is large and the real part of dct takes definite nonzero values .",
    "we note that such specific dispersion of @xmath25 is due to the intrinsic property of the graphene energy spectrum and totaly different from standard 2d electron systems with the parabolic energy spectrum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "<S> we study theoretically wave - vector and frequency dispersion of the complex dynamic conductivity tensor ( dct ) , @xmath0 , of doped monolayer graphene under a strong dc electric field . for a general analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the weak ac field of arbitrary configuration given by two independent vectors , the ac field polarization and the wave vector @xmath1 . the high - field transport and linear response to the ac field </S>",
    "<S> are described on the base of the boltzmann kinetic equation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the real part of dct , calculated in the collisionless regime , is not zero due to dissipation of the ac wave , whose energy is absorbed by the resonant dirac quasiparticles effectively interacting with the wave . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the kinematic resonance at @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the fermi velocity ) is studied in detail taking into account deviation from the linear energy spectrum and screening by the charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the isopower - density curves and distributions of angle between the ac current density and field vectors are presented as a map which provides clear graphic representation of the dct anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> also , the map shows certain ac field configurations corresponding to a negative power density , thereby it indicates regions of terahertz frequency for possible electrical ( drift ) instability in the graphene system . </S>"
