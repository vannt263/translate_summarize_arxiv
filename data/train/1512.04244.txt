    "the impressive progress in coupling single photons to single emitters , both in the microwave  @xcite and in the optical domains  @xcite , allows us to talk about an emerging field of propagating - photon quantum technology .",
    "this field already demonstrates new devices that foresee interesting applications , such as few - photon transistors  @xcite , non - classical states of the radiation field  @xcite , or photon - mediated interactions  @xcite .",
    "the development of these technologies has been accompanied by numerous analytical and numerical techniques to model light - matter and light - mediated matter interactions .",
    "these include single - photon single - qubit effective boundary conditions  @xcite , input - output theory  @xcite or scattering theory  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the degree of control of some methods , or their computational generality for arbitrary numbers of photons , remains an open problem .",
    "moreover , all these methods are restricted to the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) regime , in which counterrotating terms are neglected .",
    "the rwa breaks down , for instance , when the spontaneous emission rate of a two - level quantum emitter , @xmath0 , becomes comparable to its energy gap , @xmath1 .",
    "such deep ultra - strong coupling is now within experimental reach in the superconducting world  @xcite , and we expect that it will become also feasible in the near future in experiments with single emitters in contact with optical photons and plasmons",
    ".    the microscopic hamiltonian describing light - matter interactions can be formally mapped , in any coupling regime , onto the so - called spin - boson model  @xcite .",
    "hence , in dealing with strong and ultra - strong interactions , optics can look into condensed - matter physics for inspiration , generalising methods that work with the spin - boson hamiltonians , and adapting them in order to describe few propagating photonic excitations .",
    "some of these methods , such as the non - interacting - blip approximation ( niba )  @xcite , or wilson s numerical renormalisation group ( nrg )  @xcite , focus directly on the dynamics of the emitters , such that one can not address the scattering of photons .",
    "other methods , such as the sophisticated numerical techniques based on the density - matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) or matrix - product states ( mps ) , have a greater potential in dealing with these effects  @xcite , at the expense of a higher computational cost .    in this work ,",
    "we study a third family of methods based on the lang - firsov transformation for the polaron problem  @xcite .",
    "these methods consist on a variationally - optimised unitary transformation that displaces the electromagnetic field based on the state of the two - level emitter , and has already provided valuable results for the equilibrium properties of the spin - boson model  @xcite .",
    "we introduce a _ dynamical polaron ansatz _ , which is a time - dependent variational wavefunction describing the two - level emitter at zero temperature , together with the scattering states of the photons .",
    "we thus upgrade this family of variational methods to address relevant non - equilibrium problems , such as the spontaneous emission or the ultra - strong spectroscopy of the emitter .",
    "additionally , these dynamical ansatzs lead to analytical results in certain regimes , which are valuable to develop a physical intuition about these complex non - equilibrium effects , and can be straightforwardly generalised to more complex situations with multiple quantum emitters coupled to propagating photons .",
    "the numerical and analytical methods are simpler than full mps simulations , and a comparison with these shows good qualitative and even quantitative agreement up to very large coupling strengths , @xmath2 in the ohmic spin - boson model .",
    "this shows the potential of these conceptually and technically simpler tools for analysing and designing future experiments in propagating - photon quantum technologies .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : spin - boson ] , we introduce the spin - boson model as we use it to describe light - matter interaction of few two - level emitters , also refereed to as qubits , with a low - dimensional photonic waveguide or microwave transmission line . in sect .",
    "[ sec : ansatzs ] , we describe different variational anstze .",
    "we start with two variational anstze based on the lang - firsov transformation describing a static and a time - dependent wavefunction with up to one hybrid excitation with variational weights in the qubits or in the photonic modes .",
    "we also describe briefly the mps methods that we compare with . in sect .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , we apply all these methods to the study of a single quantum emitter in the photonic line , and its interaction with the propagating photons .",
    "we show how the ansatz properly describes the qubit polarization in the open field , the frequency renormalization , and also the transmission and reflection coefficients for an incoming low - intensity photonic wave - packet with a broad distribution among the possible photonic modes , even in the ultra - strong coupling regime . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we discuss our conclusions and possible extensions to treat multiple quantum emitters .",
    "the hamiltonian describing a collection of quantum emitters interacting with a one - dimensional electromagnetic ( em ) field in the ultra - strong coupling regime corresponds to the well - known _ few - impurity spin - boson model _",
    "@xcite , unitarily transformed to a rotated spin basis , namely @xmath3 here , @xmath4 are bosonic operators that create and annihilate a quantum of the em field with frequency @xmath5 labelled by @xmath6 ( e.g. in three - dimensions , @xmath6 contains the photon wavevector and its polarisation ) .",
    "the emitters are modelled as two - level atoms , also referred to as qubits or spins , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and we have introduced the transition frequency @xmath11 .    in the above hamiltonian",
    ", the atom - photon interaction is defined in terms of the couplings @xmath12 , which depend on the positions of the qubits @xmath13 . as customary in the quantum theory of radiation  @xcite ,",
    "the em field acts as a bosonic reservoir that modifies the dynamics of the quantum emitters depending on the distribution of the atom - photon couplings for different frequencies , namely the spectral density @xmath14 for instance , when the atom - photon couplings are weak , and the correlations of the em bath decay sufficiently fast , a single excited qubit in contact with the em field will decay exponentially with a rate @xmath15  @xcite , while a pair of qubits will show collective effects due to the exchange  @xcite , or the spontaneous emission  @xcite , of em photons .",
    "we shall consider both discrete and continuous descriptions of a one - dimensional em reservoir , which model the photons in a transmission line .    _",
    "( i ) discretized spin - boson model.- _ a transmission line of length @xmath16 can be divided into @xmath17 segments of length @xmath18 , which leads to a discretized momentum @xmath19 , with @xmath20 .",
    "the boson frequencies @xmath21 , which arise due to the couplings between the transmission line segments , and the spin - boson couplings @xmath22 , correspond to @xmath23 here , we have introduced the cutoff frequency @xmath24 , which increases as the number of segments is raised . in the continuum limit @xmath25 , and for energies well below the cutoff , one recovers the linear dispersion @xmath26 with @xmath27 playing the role of the speed of light in the transmission line .",
    "let us note that this discretized model will be used to perform numerical calculations .    _",
    "( ii ) continuum spin - boson model.- _ alternatively , we can model the transmission line directly in the continuum limit @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , and the high - frequencies are exponentially cut off by substituting @xmath30 let us note that the cutoff in this model can be set to any desired value , and the dispersion is assumed to be linear for all frequencies .",
    "this continuous model will be exploited to derive a number of analytical predictions .",
    "both models of the bosonic bath lead to an ohmic spectral density at low - enough frequencies @xmath31 , which is identical for all qubits , namely @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a dimensionless spin - boson coupling strength that plays an important role . in the context of the single - impurity spin - boson model ,",
    "ultra - strong couplings lead to the so - called localization - delocalization quantum phase transition @xmath34  @xcite , and the coherent - incoherent dynamical crossover at @xmath35  @xcite .    as mentioned above",
    ", we shall explore the consequences of such effects in the static and dynamical properties for few quantum emitters   by using two types of variational ansatz :    _ ( i ) polaron variational ansatz.- _ this ansatz was originally developed to understand the groundstate properties of the kondo effect through its connection to the spin - boson model  @xcite , and has the non - variational lang - firsov transformation as its precursor  @xcite .",
    "the polaron ansatz builds on a variational family of spin - dependent coherent states , and correctly captures the quantum phase transition at @xmath34 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the polaron method also agrees with some of the finite - temperature properties obtained by other methods  @xcite , and can be combined with markovian master equations to study the spin dynamics , although the predicted coherent - incoherent crossover does not coincide with @xmath35 . in this work ,",
    "we introduce a _ dynamical polaron ansatz _ that will allow us to overcome these limitations , and to develop a simple analytical understanding of how the archetypical quantum - optical properties of   predicted within the rwa @xcite , are modified in the ultra - strong coupling regime .",
    "moreover , this ansatz will allow us to address the dynamics of the propagating photons , which is extremely important given their experimental accessibility .    _",
    "( ii ) matrix - product - state variational ansatz.- _ introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and connected to dmrg  @xcite for one - dimensional quantum systems in  @xcite , mps anstze have the non - variational valence - bond states as their precursor  @xcite .",
    "the mps ansatz is defined as the product of a set of matrices , whose number is determined by the structure of the problem , and its size determines the accuracy of the variational procedure . as explained below , in this work we use static and time - dependent mps to study the spin - boson model in frequency space , generalising static and time - dependent techniques introduced in  @xcite .    the comparison between the quasi - exact numerical ansatz of mps and the dynamical polaron ansatz applied to eq .  , will allow us to assert the regimes of validity of the later . in our effort to make the polaron ansatz more familiar to the quantum optics community interested in going beyond the weak - coupling rwa regime , we shall determine the regimes of validity of its simpler analytical predictions .",
    "in this section , we describe in detail the above variational techniques that can be used to study both static and dynamical effects for a collection of quantum emitters interacting with a 1d em field through the spin - boson model  .",
    "we will describe the general approach , and leave its application to particular settings for the following sections .",
    "the static polaron ansatz is a variational method to approximate the equilibrium properties of a single - impurity spin - boson model , which has been applied to the ohmic  @xcite and sub - ohmic  @xcite cases with significant success , specially in light of its considerable simplicity .",
    "it can be improved by enlarging the number of variational parameters  @xcite , and generalised to the two - impurity spin - boson model  @xcite .",
    "the static ansatz can be defined in terms of a variational polaron transformation , which captures the relevant correlations between the spins and the bosons , and acts on a product state where the spins and the bosons are not entangled . for an arbitrary number of spins @xmath36",

    "accordingly , the problem reduces to function minimization , and yields the optimal parameters @xmath50 $ ] , which are denoted with a star super - index , and shall be used in the following sections . for more than two impurities ,",
    "since the ising interactions can have any particular pattern , an analytical solution can not be obtained in general , and one must resort to lanczos methods to extract the groundstate of the spin hamiltonian , which can be efficiently implemented for reasonably high @xmath36 .",
    "although understanding the static properties of the spin - boson model is already a non - trivial problem , specially for a few impurities , a considerably more challenging task is to develop an accurate description of non - equilibrium effects , and a number of techniques have been put forth over the years for that purpose  @xcite . as already mentioned in the introduction",
    ", most of these techniques can only address qubit obervables , which is consistent with situations where the bosonic bath can not be measured .",
    "however , with the advent of the new propagating - photon quantum technologies , this situation has been reversed , as the photonic properties of the setup are now accessible .",
    "the goal of this section is to introduce an accurate , yet simple , variational ansatz that captures these dynamical effects for both the emitters and the photons .    in order to introduce such a dynamical polaron ansatz ,",

    "however , if one is interested in the reduced dynamics of either the spins , as customary in studies of the spin - boson model  @xcite , or an incoming photonic wave - packet for transmission - reflection experiments , one may try to develop a weisskopf - wigner - type theory  @xcite for the above system of first - order differential equations .",
    "these equations can always be rewritten as @xmath69 where we have introduced the energy of the spin excitations @xmath70 , and the couplings @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , which can be obtained from the matrix elements of @xmath65 .",
    "note that the couplings fulfil @xmath73 , and can be thus diagonalized by an orthogonal transformation @xmath74 .",
    "accordingly , we can transform the variational parameters @xmath75 , and the remaining couplings @xmath76 , such that @xmath77 this system of equations resembles the weisskopf - wigner equations of spontaneous emission of two - level atoms coupled to the em field  @xcite .",
    "let us highlight , however , that they are valid beyond the rwa intrinsic to the standard weisskopf - wigner theory thanks to the polaronic variational methods .",
    "if one is interested in the reduced dynamics of the quantum emitters , as usual in the spin - boson model or in the theory of quantum radiation , one can develop a weisskopf - wigner - type  @xcite theory by formally integrating the equations for the bosonic amplitudes , and substituting them in the equations for the qubit amplitudes .",
    "conversely , one may be interested in the scattering of propagating photons from the collection of quantum emitters , which would require the opposite process . in the following sections",
    ", we shall use both approaches , highlighting the importance of taking into account non - markovian effects in the ultra - strong coupling regime .    let us note at this point that if the initial state contains some atomic coherences , the ansatz   must be generalised to include also an amplitude in the groundstate @xmath78\\to",
    "w_{\\rm sp}[\\alpha_s(t),\\alpha_k(t)]+\\alpha_{\\rm gs}(t)$ ] .",
    "however , this amplitude does not contribute with any term in the evaluation of eq .  , and thus @xmath79 , whereas the time - evolution of the remaining variational parameters is still described by eq .",
    "yet , including this groundstate amplitude may be necessary to calculate the dynamics of certain observables , such as the atomic coherences that are important for the coherent - incoherent transition of the spin - boson model .    at this stage",
    ", it is worth pointing out that our dynamical ansatz   differs from the application of the so - called davidov ansatzs , which arise in the study of exciton - phonon interactions , to the spin - boson model  @xcite .",
    "there are two crucial differences : _",
    "( i ) _ our ansatz is built in two steps , such that the polaron parameters are already fixed during the computation of the dynamical properties .",
    "this contrasts the davidov ansatzs , which consists on time - dependent polaron parameters with additional time - dependent variational weights for each spin state . _",
    "( ii ) _ our ansatz considers also additional single - photon excitations , which are absent in the davidov ansatzs  @xcite . property _ ( i ) _ will be crucial to be able to derive analytical expressions for the dynamics , whereas property _",
    "( ii ) _ will be crucial to describe the effect of spontaneous emission and photon scattering .",
    "the previous ansatz will be compared with a well - established method  @xcite for the numerical simulation of the spin - boson model , which combines ideas from the quantum impurity ansatz  @xcite , matrix product operators  @xcite , and arnoldi - type evolution methods  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we write down a variational wavefunction for the qubit - photon system as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the quantum state of the qubit , @xmath82 are the fock states of @xmath83 different photon modes in frequency space , and the @xmath84 s are different matrices with a size of up to @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the bond dimension of the mps ansatz and @xmath87 is the maximum occupation of the bosonic modes .",
    "in addition to this encoding of the wavefunction , we efficiently write the spin - boson model as a long - range - interaction matrix product operator ( mpo ) , which has a rather small bond dimension , @xmath88 .    combining the efficient representation of the hamiltonian with the mps wavefunction",
    ", we can either compute approximations to the ground state of spin - boson model , or implement a time - evolution algorithm . in the first case we work by minimizing the energy functional @xmath89 = \\frac{\\braket{\\psi_a | h |\\psi_a}}{\\braket{\\psi_a | \\psi_a}},\\ ] ] with respect to the collection of numbers in all the matrices / tensors @xmath84 .",
    "the minimization procedure is efficient thanks to the mpo representation of the hamiltonian , even when it contains long - range interactions , and it is implemented with a generalisation of the dmrg sweeping technique .    the time evolution is implemented using an approximation of the exponential of the hamiltonian for short times .",
    "more precisely , we construct @xmath90 as a linear combination of mps , @xmath91 , where the vectors @xmath92 form a krylov basis built with mps themselves , as explained in ref .",
    "the use of arnoldi expansions allows us to profit from the mpo expansion of the hamiltonian and work with the long - range interactions , something which is much harder with trotter expansions .",
    "it has to be remarked that , while more accurate than the dynamical polaron ansatz , the mps method is more complex from the implementation and computational point of view .",
    "the number of parameters in an mps variational wavefunction scale as @xmath93 , while in our few photon dynamical ansatz with one qubit , we have at most @xmath94 degrees of freedom .",
    "it is therefore interesting to use the mps as a benchmark with which to assert the range of validity of the polaron ansatz , with the idea of both having a flexible and simpler tool , and also a way to implement potential analytical approximations and effective models .",
    "once the different variational ansatz have been described , let us apply them to the simplest possible scenario : a single quantum emitter ultra - strongly coupled to a 1d em field .",
    "we will exploit the analytic polaron predictions based on the continuum model   to offer physical insight , and benchmark the numerical polaron results based on the discretised model   with mps simulations for an identical discretisation .",
    "the main objective is to prove that the simple polaron ansatz , in comparison to the more involved mps technique , provides a sufficiently accurate description of both static and dynamical phenomena , with the hope that it will be established as a simple theoretical tool within the quantum optics community dealing with the ultra - strong coupling regime .",
    "let us consider the solution of the variational system of equations for the continuum single - impurity spin - boson model in eqs .   and  @xcite . for @xmath95 ,",

    ", we can recover the variational groundstate   and calculate any observable .",
    "let us note that by applying a non - variational perturbative approach in the polaron - transformed picture , the same condition   has been found by imposing that the first - order perturbations vanish  @xcite , as customary in spin - wave approaches  @xcite .",
    "note that the system of equations   can be rewritten in terms of a single implicit equation for the renormalized qubit frequency @xmath101 where the super - index @xmath102 stands for the continuum polaron model , and the exact spectral function corresponding to eq .",
    "is @xmath103 .",
    "this equation can be solved analytically in the so - called scaling limit @xmath104 , where one finds @xmath105 with @xmath106 , and @xmath0 as euler s constant .",
    "therefore , the polaron ansatz predicts that the frequency of the quantum emitter gets renormalized as a consequence of its coupling to the photonic excitations ( i.e. a photonic polaron cloud dresses the quantum emitter and leads to a renormalized transition frequency ) .",
    "this agrees with adiabatic renormalisation group arguments  @xcite , and locates the localization - delocalization transition at @xmath34 , where the qubit frequency vanishes .",
    "this is an example of the of the so - called boundary quantum phase transitions that also arise in other condensed - matter contexts  @xcite .    using this result",
    ", we can recover the polaron   and spin   optimal parameters , which shall be denoted as @xmath107 $ ] , and calculate any static observable by constructing the polaron groundstate  , such as @xmath108 for weak spin - boson interactions @xmath109 , @xmath110 as expected from the groundstate of a bare qubit @xmath111 .",
    "however , as the coupling to the bosonic bath is raised , the groundstate starts populating also the excited bare state @xmath112 , until @xmath113 for @xmath114 . in the usual rotated basis of the spin - boson model  @xcite",
    ", this corresponds to the localised phase .",
    "as emphasised previously , the continuum model serves to gain analytical insight into the static effects .",
    "however , it is the discrete version which can be benchmarked with mps simulations and , more importantly , the model that provides a more accurate microscopic description of the bosonic bath in the physical transmission line .",
    "the solution of the variational problem in this discretised spin - boson model requires the use of numerics , and has not been considered previously in the literature .    in the discretised model in eqs .   and",
    ", the transmission line is divided into coupled segments , such that the cutoff frequency depends on the input parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 , being @xmath16 the total physical length of the line , and @xmath17 the number of segments of length @xmath115 in which it is divided .",
    "we are interested in raising the number of segments @xmath17 for a fixed length @xmath16 , such that the cutoff @xmath116 can be maximised towards the above scaling limit , and the linear region of the dispersion relation @xmath26 around the qubit frequencies @xmath11 contains as many photonic modes as possible .",
    "however , we also note that the computational complexity of the polaron / mps ansatz grows with @xmath17 , as the number of bosonic modes also increases , @xmath19 with @xmath20 , and we can not consider an arbitrarily - large @xmath17 .    in the discretised polaron ansatz ,",
    "we numerically diagonalize the transformed hamiltonian   to obtain the state of minimum energy as a function of the variational parameters @xmath117 $ ] .",

    "an important and crucial advantage of the discretised model is that , for the same effort , one can get information about the dynamics of the photons . as emphasized previously , this is rather unique to our method , and very important in light of the current experiments .",
    "for instance , it may be of interest to study the photon number density @xmath173 after the qubit has relaxed completely",
    ". it will give an indirect measure of the qubit frequency akin to a spectroscopy experiment , since the emitted photon is expected to have the same energy as the qubit excitation .",
    "we calculated the photon distribution as a function of the coupling strength and the frequency of the modes within our discrete polaron ansatz , and compared the predictions to another simulation with the same parameters using the mps ansatz .",

    "[ fig_emission ] , both methods show clearly a peak in the distribution around the renormalized qubit frequency calculated through the static ansatz in the previous section , and thus confirm the above intuition that this photonic observable serves as a spectroscopy probe .",
    "let us note that , since we are using periodic boundary conditions for the transmission line , time must be long enough for the spin excitation to have decayed , but sufficiently short that the photon can not get around the line and scatter with the emitter again ( revival time ) .",
    "the other type of experiment that can be simulated with these tools is the scattering of one photon travelling in the transmission line with one qubit impurity",
    ". the photon distribution , after the collision has occurred , will give information about the transmission and reflection coefficients of the photons in the transmission line ( @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively ) .",
    "in the polaron - transformed frame , we can consider the initial state as a product of its two components , the qubit in the ground state and the photon distribution specified by the probability amplitudes @xmath176 , namely @xmath177 during the collision , and some time after it has happened , photon and qubit interact such that the wavefunction is no longer in a product state .",
    "however , for long - enough times , the qubit will have decayed completely , and we can describe the state again as @xmath178 with a different photon distribution specified by the probability amplitudes @xmath179 .",
    "this enables us to define the transmission and reflection coefficients as @xmath180 being @xmath181 and @xmath182 the complex phases of the coefficients , and @xmath183 include all the phases due to the evolution .",
    "the calculation of transmission and reflection coefficients , @xmath184 and @xmath185 , can be achieved from the expectation value of the photon number operator .    instead of having an initially excited qubit , this time we initialise the system with one single photon travelling in one direction of the line with the qubit in its ground state , which corresponds to eq .",
    "for a particular set of probability amplitudes .",
    "this photon will be very localized , and will have a flat frequency distribution , but only in the positive momentum .",
    "after the scattering , some of the modes will be absorbed by the qubit and re - emitted afterwards in both directions , effectively being reflected / transmitted from the qubit .",
    "this will be depicted by modes with positive momentum vanishing , and some other modes with the same energy but opposite momentum appearing . to check that our polaron predictions for this scattering experiment are consistent",
    ", we compare the photon density resonances with the renormalized qubit gap obtained through the static ansatz .",
    "we can confirm this in fig .",
    "[ fig_scattering_sh ] , which also shows that for high enough couplings , the qubit stops interacting with the photons because its dynamics gets frozen .",
    "this analysis of the probability density of the photons gives the norm of the transmission and reflection coefficients .",
    "additionally , we can also calculate the phase shift as the difference between the final and initial phases , by subtracting the phase due to the time evolution . to perform this task , we run two simulations , the first one with the qubit connected to the line and the second one without it ( equivalent to setting the coupling strength to zero ) .",

    "these expressions allow us to study how the spontaneous emission of the pair of qubits gets modified as the coupling to the em field increases , eventually entering the ultra - strong coupling regime . regarding the individual decay rates , their change with respect to the weak - coupling value is caused by both the renormalization of the qubit frequency @xmath206 , and the ising interactions due to virtual photon exchange @xmath207 .",

    "let us first comment on the regime where the qubits are so far apart that the ising interaction is negligible .",
    "when the spin - boson coupling is sufficiently weak @xmath109 , we recover the result expected from the usual weisskopf - wigner theory of spontaneous emission @xmath213 which rests on the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) . regarding the collective spontaneous emission in this weak - coupling regime , we observe that it gets suppressed for distances @xmath214 with @xmath215 , which coincides again with the predictions based on the rwa  @xcite . on the contrary",

    "let us now move onto the other regime where the standard weisskopf - wigner predictions are modified : short inter - qubit distances .",
    "even in the weak - coupling regime where @xmath222 , the strength of the individual decay rates , @xmath223 , is different from the rwa predictions @xmath213 as a consequence of the ferromagnetic ising interactions @xmath224 . the distance where the collective decay rates get suppressed ( enhanced ) is also modified by the presence of interactions @xmath225 ( @xmath226 ) with @xmath215",

    "is increased , these distances are changed as a consequence of the renormalization of the qubits frequency @xmath242 with @xmath215 .",
    "however , when the spin - photon coupling is sufficiently large , the interactions are totally suppressed since @xmath243 and no coherent swap of the excitation can occur .",
    "we thus see that in the localized phase , all coherent and incoherent processes are inhibited .",
    "the situation changes considerably at very short distances , where the coherent ising part @xmath188 given by eq .",
    "becomes the leading term in the scaling limit . in this case , the interactions @xmath244 become independent of the renormalized qubit frequency , and diverge with the cutoff frequency .",
    "such behaviour is consistent with the results based on the rwa approximation , and predict that the excitation can always be coherently swapped between the qubits , provided that they are close enough . in the localized regime , @xmath245 , the decay channels are suppressed , such that the qubits continue swapping the excitation indefinitely .",
    "let us finally highlight that , just as the simple markovian approximation leading to eqs .   can be improved to predict the coherent - incoherent transition by taking into account non - markovian effects , it can also be improved by taking into account retardation times for the exchange of photons  @xcite , thus making an interesting connection with the emerging causality for spin - boson models discretised on a lattice  @xcite .",

    "<S> in this work we develop a semi - analytical variational ansatz to study the properties of few photon excitations interacting with a collection of quantum emitters in regimes that go beyond the rotating wave approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this method can be used to approximate both the static and dynamical properties of a superconducting qubit in an open transmission line , including the spontaneous emission spectrum and the resonances in scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the approximations are quantitatively accurate for rather strong couplings , as shown by a direct comparison to matrix - product - state numerical methods , and provide also a good qualitative description for stronger couplings well beyond the markovian regime . </S>"
