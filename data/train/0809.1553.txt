    "elementary particles can be classified in two categories according to the value of their spin .",
    "half - integer spin particles obey fermi - dirac statistics and are called fermions whereas integer - spin particles obey bose - einstein statistics and are known as bosons .",
    "however , some quantum objects may obey other ( fractional ) statistics describing nontrivial braiding as initially suggested by leinaas and myrheim more than thirty years ago @xcite , and by wilczek in the eighties @xcite .",
    "despite numerous theoretical works , these so - called anyons are still waiting for a direct observation although recent experimental proposals are very promising ( see ref .  ) .    in the last years , anyons have drawn much attention because of their interest for topological quantum computation @xcite . in this perspective",
    ", several models have been proposed among which the celebrated toric code @xcite which is a spin-1/2 system whose elementary excitations behave as semions . however , the experimental realization of this system is rather tricky since it involves four - spin interactions . here",
    ", we shall focus on another system originally proposed by kitaev @xcite which only involves two - spin interactions .",
    "this model is very rich since it contains abelian and non - abelian anyonic as well as fermionic excitations .",
    "thus , it has been the subject of many recent studies concerning the spectrum , @xcite the correlation functions and the entanglement @xcite , or the quench dynamics @xcite .",
    "let us also mention several extensions @xcite among which the analysis of time - reversal symmetry breaking terms @xcite which may give rise to a chiral spin liquid .",
    "furthermore , this model is susceptible to be realized in various experimental systems such as polar molecules , ultracold atoms @xcite or josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "it thus constitutes an appealing candidate for the observation of anyons .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of fermions in the spectrum may spoil the detection process  ; a point completely missed in a recent proposal ( see ref .   for explanation and ref .   for details ) .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to investigate the gapped phase of the kitaev honeycomb model @xcite .",
    "indeed , in his remarkable seminal paper , kitaev mainly focuses on the special subspace of the hilbert space to which the ground state belongs to and the low - energy spectrum of other subspaces has only been discussed lately @xcite .",
    "our aim is to bridge this gap by providing a high - order perturbative analysis , in the isolated - dimer limit , of the spectrum as well as some interesting results about the creation and the manipulation of anyons which is of relevance for experiments @xcite .",
    "part of our results have already been given in two short papers @xcite and the present paper may be considered as an extended and detailed version of these works .",

    "however , not all of them can be set independently to @xmath37 .",
    "some relations among them arise from the following fact ( which can be checked by studying all possible cases )  : the product of @xmath20 and a nearby loop operator @xmath38 gives a new loop operator @xmath39 , as illustrated on a particular example in fig .",

    "the above discussed local conserved quantities are not sufficient to fully diagonalize the hamiltonian . indeed ,",

    "however , @xmath33 has a crucial property  : it can be transformed into a free majorana fermions hamiltonian and is thus exactly solvable .",
    "let us also mention that another solution based on the jordan - wigner transformation maps the spin hamiltonian @xmath33 onto a spinless fermions system with @xmath18-wave pairing @xcite .",
    "as shown by kitaev @xcite , the ground state of @xmath33 lies in the vortex - free sector and the phase diagram contains , in this sector , two phases  : a gapped phase for @xmath52 and a gapless phase for @xmath53 . in the gapped phase the low - energy excitations are abelian anyons ( semions ) whereas in the gapless phase , the low - energy excitations are fermionic .",
    "the gapless phase acquires a gap in the presence of a magnetic field and then contains gapped non - abelian anyon excitations .",
    "the phase diagram has also been investigated in other vortex configurations such as the vortex - full sector and similar phases have been obtained .",
    "more precisely , one has a gapped phase for @xmath54 and a gapless phase in the opposite case@xcite .",
    "our goal here is to determine the low - energy spectrum for any vortex configuration .",
    "of course , one may use the fermionic hamiltonian mentioned above but , it can only be exactly diagonalized for translation - invariant configuration . here , we follow an alternative route by focusing on the isolated - dimer limit @xmath55 .",
    "the very first step of our analysis consists in mapping the four possible states of the two spins of a @xmath3-dimer onto those of an effective spin and a hardcore boson .",
    "more precisely , denoting @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) the eigenstate of @xmath58 with eigenvalue @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , an isolated @xmath3-dimer can be in one of the two low - energy states @xmath61 with energy @xmath62 , or in one of the two high - energy states @xmath63 with energy @xmath64 . keeping in mind that our aim is to perform a perturbation theory in the limit @xmath55 , it is natural to interpret the change from a ferromagnetic to an anti - ferromagnetic configuration as the creation of a particle with an energy cost @xmath65 . by construction ,",
    "such a particle is a hardcore boson .",
    "the remaining degree of freedom can be described by a spin 1/2 , indicating which of the two configurations is realized .",
    "there are many possible parametrizations but here we choose the following @xmath66 the left ( right ) spin is the one of the black ( white ) site of the dimer ( @xmath67 , etc ) .",
    "double arrows represent the state of the effective spin which is here the same as the state of the left ( black ) spin .",
    "within such a mapping , effective spins and hardcore bosons live on the effective square lattice of @xmath3-dimers ( see fig .",

    "therefore , we first translate the action of the spin operators in the effective - spin boson ( esb ) formalism .",
    "it is easy to check that one has @xmath69 the operators @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) are the pauli matrices acting on the effective spin at site @xmath68 , while @xmath72 and @xmath73 are hardcore bosonic annihilation and creation operators , satisfying the usual on - site anticommutation relation @xmath74 ( and operators on different sites commute ) .",
    "setting once for all @xmath75 so that creating a boson costs an energy @xmath24 in the isolated - dimer limit , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) reads @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of @xmath3-dimers ( or , equivalently , of square plaquettes ) , and @xmath78 these operators are built from local hopping and pair creation operators @xmath79 we emphasize that the mapping ( [ eq : mapping ] ) explicitly breaks the symmetry between white and black sites of the original brick - wall lattice .",

    "the elementary hopping and pair creation operators , namely @xmath98 and @xmath99 with @xmath68 and @xmath100 nearest neighbors , have a very remarkable property : they all commute with the @xmath20 s , as well as with any other loop operator @xmath101=[v_{{\\boldsymbol{i}}}^{{\\boldsymbol{j}}},w_p]=[t_{{\\boldsymbol{i}}}^{{\\boldsymbol{j}}},\\mathcal{l } ]    = [ v_{{\\boldsymbol{i}}}^{{\\boldsymbol{j}}},\\mathcal{l}]=0.\\ ] ] the original spin problem on the honeycomb lattice is thus mapped onto a quadratic hardcore boson problem on an effective square lattice , with conserved plaquette and loop operators .",
    "let us underline that this mapping is exact and just provides an alternative description of the spin problem .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_v2 ] ) remains difficult to diagonalize ( except , of course , if one remembers that the model can be fermionized ) , since ( _ i _ ) bosons are hard core which prevents the use of a bogoliubov transformation , ( _ ii _ ) bosonic and spin degrees of freedom are correlated .",
    "the conserved plaquette operators will of course be useful in simplifying and solving the problem as recently underlined in ref .  .",
    "the starting point of the present perturbation theory is the isolated - dimer limit , namely @xmath102 . in this limit",
    ", the spectrum is made of equidistant and degenerate levels separated by an energy gap @xmath103 . to compute the perturbative spectrum ,",
    "there are of course several methods among which the green s function formalism initially used by kitaev @xcite .",
    "however , if this approach is efficient to obtain the first nontrivial ( nonconstant ) correction , it becomes tricky to implement at higher orders .    here , following ref .",
    ", we use an alternative approach based on continuous unitary transformations ( cuts ) conjointly proposed by wegner @xcite and gazek and wilson @xcite .",
    "we refer the interested reader to ref .   for a recent pedagogical introduction .",
    "its perturbative version denoted pcuts is especially well - suited to the problem at hand .",
    "this technique is detailed in several works @xcite .",
    "let us simply mention that the cuts method requires the choice of a generator that drives the flow of the operators .",
    "all the results given here have been obtained with the so - called quasiparticle number - conserving generator first proposed by mielke @xcite for finite matrices and generalized to many - body systems by knetter and uhrig@xcite .",
    "the latter have computed the perturbative expansion for _ any _ hamiltonian of the form @xmath104 provided two hypothesis are satisfied :    * the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath105 has an equidistant spectrum bounded from below  ; * the perturbing hamiltonian @xmath106 is such that @xmath107=n\\ , t_n$ ] .    clearly , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_v2 ] ) meets these two criteria ( up to a constant term ) noting that in the present case , one has @xmath108 . here",
    ", we have included the `` small '' parameters , namely @xmath109 and @xmath110 , in the definition of the @xmath111 operators , which is not the convention usually adopted in the cuts community .",
    "the cuts method together with the quasiparticle number - conserving generator unitarily transforms the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamcut ] ) into an effective hamiltonian @xmath112 commuting with @xmath105 , @xmath113 being a unitary operator .",
    "we give the first terms of the expansion up to order 4 in appendix [ app : pcut ] .",
    "as can be seen in table [ tab : heff ] , the number of terms appearing in the perturbative expansion quickly increases with the order .",
    "for instance , at order 2 , the effective hamiltonian reads in our case @xmath114 whereas at order 10 , there are more than @xmath115 operators to consider .    writing @xmath116 this way is only the very first part of the job since one next has to ( _ i _ ) determine its action in each subspace of a given quasiparticle ( qp ) number @xmath117  ; ( _ ii _ ) diagonalize @xmath116 in each of these subspaces . this is the object of the next sections  : we first study the lowest - energy states ( @xmath118 qp ) which is the main contribution of our work  ; then we turn to the @xmath119 qp states and recover the high - energy gap from the qp dispersion  ; we end by @xmath120 qp states , whose properties determine the statistics of the qps , and we will see that the qps behave as fermions which are , furthermore , non interacting .",
    "this fact is at the origin of a tremendous simplification of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , we found that @xmath116 can be written , at all orders and in the thermodynamical limit , as @xmath121 we shall discuss each term in detail in the following sections , but let us mention that @xmath122 , @xmath123 , the @xmath124 s and the @xmath125 s are coefficients whose series expansion are computed .",
    "the @xmath126 operators are strings of spin operators @xmath127 and of phase factors @xmath128 on the cluster @xmath129 .",
    "this very special form of multi - particle terms [ remember @xmath130 , leading to phase factors and spin - strings only , is responsible for the emergence of fermions in the model .    for a finite - size system with pbc",
    ", new terms appear in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "they involve loop operators around the torus , and appear at a minimal order being the linear size @xmath131 of the lattice .",
    "such loop operators are associated to contours as the ones shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : loop_operators ] and [ fig : loop_operators_square ] , namely @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath132 for the contours @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the presence of such loop operators in the effective hamiltonian shows that the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are also eigenstates of these loop operators .",
    "their effect is to lift the degeneracies between states ( which for each energy is at least four in the thermodynamical limit , since some of the excitations are abelian semions and the genus of a torus is 1 , see ref .  ) .",
    "we shall not dive into the details of such finite - size corrections , since our approach allows us to directly tackle with the most interesting thermodynamical limit .",
    "however , let us make a remark about a numerical check of this statement for small system sizes .",
    "for a torus whose linear size is strictly smaller than 4 , the loop operator terms around the torus dominate the expansion over the @xmath20 s , and for a size of 4 both types of terms start contributing at the same order .",
    "one should thus not be surprised to find a ground - state for @xmath13 which is not in the vortex - free sector @xcite .",
    "before we turn to a detailed analysis of each qp subspace , let us show that we do not miss any state using simple counting arguments .",
    "we have already seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , that one has @xmath136 conserved @xmath137 quantities ( two loop operators , and @xmath77 plaquette operators ) , with the constraint @xmath138 .",
    "there is in fact one more relation between the @xmath20 s , involving the number of bosons , which reads @xmath139 showing that the parity of the number of vortices living on white plaquettes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pbc ] ) has to be the same as the parity of the number of bosons .",
    "the last equality simply comes from the previously mentioned constraint ( [ eq : prodw ] ) .",
    "the first equality can be checked using the expression ( [ eq : wp_eff ] ) of the @xmath20 s .",
    "indeed , for a site @xmath68 having a white plaquette on its left , and another one on its right , the product of the two associated @xmath20 s will give @xmath140 .",
    "in the same way , for a site @xmath68 having a white plaquette above it , and another one under it , the product of the two associated @xmath20 s will give @xmath141 .",
    "let us note that ( [ eq : prodw_white ] ) has a meaning in the two bases we are working in , the initial one and the unitarily transformed one .",
    "indeed , in the initial basis , the hamiltonian @xmath33 commutes with the parity operator @xmath142  ; in the rotated basis , @xmath116 commutes with @xmath105 .",
    "we thus see that in a subspace with a given number of qp s , there are @xmath77 independent conserved @xmath137 quantities .",
    "thus , @xmath77 being the number of effective spins @xmath143 , there is no remaining effective spin degree of freedom once the @xmath137 quantities are chosen . as a conclusion ,",
    "the @xmath117-qp subspace has dimension @xmath144 , with the usual notation for binomial coefficients .",
    "this shows that we miss no state , since @xmath145 where @xmath10 is the total number of spins in the brick - wall lattice .",
    "this discussion furthermore sheds light on the fact that in order to compute eigenenergies , a perturbative expansion of the kitaev model ( as opposed to exact numerics ) is really of interest only in the @xmath146-qp subspace .",
    "indeed , we have just seen that there are @xmath77 independent @xmath137 conserved quantities .",
    "it is thus clear that as soon as we will have written down the effective hamiltonian in the @xmath146-qp subspace , the hamiltonian will already be diagonal , whatever the vortex configuration , although writing down the eigenstates of the @xmath137 quantities in the basis of effective spin operators still has to be done .",
    "however , in the @xmath24-qp subspace , one will have to diagonalize an @xmath147 matrix ( numerically in the case of a nonperiodic vortex configuration ) , which is identical to what one has to do when solving the problem exactly as kitaev did .",
    "for @xmath120 , the perturbative expansion looks even more complicated than the exact solution , but this is an artifact , since we recover free fermions .",
    "in the 0-qp sector , and in the thermodynamical limit the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : heff_explicit ] ) simplifies and reads @xmath148 where @xmath149 denotes a set of @xmath150 plaquettes and the @xmath20 s are the conserved plaquette operators introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "note than when restricted to the 0-qp sector they simplify to @xmath151 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : wp_eff ] ) ] .    as mentioned at the end of the previous section , obtaining eigenenergies only requires a minimal amount of work , namely replacing each @xmath20 by numbers @xmath31 , and doing the same with loop operators , without forgetting about the constraints among these quantities .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the coefficients @xmath122 and @xmath152 are given in appendix [ app : zeroqp ] .",
    "let us note that @xmath149 does not need to be a linked cluster of plaquettes ( as seen for @xmath153 that is nonvanishing at order 10 ) , and that translational invariance of the hamiltonian implies that the @xmath152 coefficients only depend on @xmath154 relative positions of the plaquettes .",
