    "evidence for the existence of dark matter ( dm ) has been observed in various astrophysical systems , ranging from satellite dwarf galaxies to massive galactic clusters and cosmology .",
    "possible cold dark matter candidates arise from theoretical models conceived to extend the standard model of elementary particles and weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) are the current main paradigm ( see @xcite for a recent review on dark matter candidates ) .",
    "the fact that direct observation of dark matter particles has not yet been possible justifies all the efforts devoted to their indirect detection , i.e. , the observation of anomalous components in the cosmic rays spectrum that can be attributed to dark matter annihilation .",
    "see @xcite for examples of such searches in the @xmath1-ray , x - ray , radio and neutrino spectra .",
    "in fact , dark matter self - annihilation is expected to produce several standard model particles , among which electrons and positrons that , by interacting with the galactic magnetic field , emit synchrotron radiation in the radio band . we can estimate the intensity of the emission coming from a given direction in the sky by adopting models or using measurements to describe the following quantities : the dark matter density profile , which can be modelled by using the results of halo formation numerical simulations ; the magnetic field , estimated through techniques such as the analysis of polarisation of radio and optical emission and rotation measures ; and the interstellar radiation field and hydrogen distribution , which are needed to account for the electron / positron energy losses .",
    "the comparison of this emission with the observed radio emission then allows to impose constraints on the values of the dark matter s mass , @xmath2 , and its thermally averaged annihilation cross section , @xmath3 .    in order for this method to provide reliable constraints ,",
    "the values of all the involved parameters need to be known very well , which often does not happen .",
    "furthermore , ideally , the comparison between the theoretical result and the observed emission should be made after all the known astrophysical foreground has been subtracted from the observations . in practice , however , such subtraction is subject to several uncertainties , since often we can not accurately model all the components contributing to the foreground .",
    "in addition , the method presents an intrinsic shortcoming : we can only calculate the contributions from dm annihilation integrated along the line of sight , so all the dm signal may be ` averaged ' away by low emitting regions that happen to fall along the same direction in the sky .    in the present paper , we present constraints obtained by applying this method to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and comparing the results with radio observations at 1.4 and 4.8 ghz .",
    "unless not otherwise stated , we will follow the formalism described in @xcite in our calculations .",
    "we analyse two possible wimp annihilation channels , a hadronic and a leptonic one , the latter having been recently proposed as a possible cause of the anomalous cosmic ray electron / positron spectrum measured by pamela @xcite and fermi ",
    "lat @xcite .    by extensive use of available observations of the lmc in different frequencies ,",
    "we are able to obtain realistic information to describe all the inputs necessary to estimate the dm annihilation signal . in this way",
    ", we escape from the ` too many hypotheses ' problem that has recurrently appeared in the existing literature on the subject .",
    "when we do have to make a hypothesis , we follow the most conservative path , making sure that our choice will not overestimate the signal .",
    "the lmc , at a distance of only @xmath4 kpc from us @xcite , is probably one of the best studied galaxies in almost all frequency bands .",
    "rotation curve data imply that the lmc total mass inside a 9 kpc radius is @xmath5 m@xmath6 , while the sum of the stellar and neutral gas masses is estimated to be @xmath7 m@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lmc must be dark matter dominated .",
    "the fact that the lmc is nearly face - on ( its disc forms an angle of @xmath8 with the plane of the sky @xcite ) , minimises the line - of - sight integration problem mentioned above , since , in this case , the integration spans only over the thickness of the galaxy .",
    "a nearly face - on view also allows us to clearly distinguish between high emitting and low emitting regions within the disc , i.e. between regions where different astrophysical processes are taking place and different astrophysical foregrounds exist .    in @xcite ,",
    "some of the authors of the present paper looked for dm annihilation from low radio emitting regions ( called ` radio cavities ' ) within the nearly face - on local group member messier 33 ( inclination @xmath9 ) . following this reference",
    ", a good candidate radio cavity should present low radio emission relative to the rest of the disc and should not be very far from the centre of the galaxy . while the first criterion guarantees that the astrophysical foreground in that region is relatively small , the second one is required so that the dm density is non negligible and that the possibility of a high magnetic field is not ruled out .",
    "although this study produced constraints comparable to those obtained for the milky way ( see for example @xcite ) , the lack of knowledge of the values of the astrophysical environment governing the diffusion of the electrons and positrons , in particular the magnetic field , introduces several uncertainties on the results .    in the current analysis , in contrast",
    ", we use recent accurate rotation measures ( rms ) from point sources behind the lmc obtained in @xcite , through which we can directly estimate the magnitude of the magnetic field in several regions for the disc of the lmc .",
    "we focus our analysis on 23 regions on the lmc s disc with galactocentric distances @xmath10 8 kpc for which a rm has been measured .",
    "although these regions are not chosen to be radio cavities , the fact that a background radio source has been seen there , guarantees that they present low radio emission in comparison to other parts of the galaxy ( intensity at 1.4 and 4.8 ghz @xmath10 2 mjy / beam ) . for each of these regions",
    "we calculate the expected dm emission at 1.4 and 4.8 ghz and compare the results with the observed values without performing any foreground subtraction ( which is a conservative choice , since removing part of the observed emission would always strengthen the constraints ) .",
    "previous searches for dark matter annihilation signals from the lmc have analysed both the @xmath1-ray @xcite and radio @xcite bands .",
    "in particular , in the latter the flux density in several radio frequencies due to annihilation into the hadronic channel integrated over the entire galaxy is calculated . however , unlike what is done here , in @xcite a simple constant magnetic field inside the entire volume of the galaxy is assumed . furthermore ,",
    "electron / positron energy losses due to inverse compton scattering and bremsstrahlung are neglected in @xcite although , as we show in section  [ energylosses ] , these processes can be very important in several regions of the lmc .",
    "when appropriate , we will comment on the effect of these assumptions and compare our results with theirs .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ radiodata ]",
    "we present the radio data used in our analysis and the 23 regions studied .",
    "section  [ profiles ] is dedicated to the distribution of dark matter in the halo of the lmc and presents the results of fits to different dark matter profiles . in section  [ energylosses ]",
    "we discuss the energy loss processes important to our calculations . in section  [ imposingconstraints ]",
    "we present our results and discuss them and compare with previous ones in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we used radio observations of the lmc at two different frequencies , 1.4 and 4.8 ghz . at 1.4 ghz",
    ", we used the mosaic image obtained with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and the parkes telescope @xcite , shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ radiomaps ] .",
    "the hpbw for this image is 40 arcsec , which corresponds to @xmath11 pc at the lmc s position , and its sensitivity is estimated to be between 0.25 and 0.35 mjy / beam . at 4.8 ghz , we used the observations made with the atca described in @xcite and shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ radiomaps ] .",
    "the hpbw is 33 arcsec and the estimated sensitivity is 0.28 mjy / beam .",
    "we estimated the radio emission due to dark matter annihilation at these two frequencies coming from 23 circular regions with radius 180 arcsec within the lmc s disc .",
    "the selection of regions was made according to the results presented in @xcite , where the faraday rotation for 291 polarised sources behind the lmc was measured , 100 of which happen to lay directly behind the lmc .",
    "after subtracting the effects due to the foreground faraday rotation in the milky way , a map of rotation measures is obtained ( fig . 1 in @xcite ) , where circles of various sizes represent the magnitude of the rm at each position .",
    "we chose the positions of 23 circles to apply our method , selecting them according to their diameter , which is proportional to the rm at that position ( large rm implies large magnetic field and therefore large synchrotron emission ) , and distance from the centre of the lmc ( as we move away from the centre the density of dm decreases ) . in our calculations we used the lmc s kinematic centre , with coordinates ra@xmath12 and dec@xmath1302 @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can see that both the isothermal sphere and the burkert profile did not fit well the data , resulting in @xmath14 .",
    "for the einasto profile , we found that good fits ( with values of @xmath15 around 1.5 ) can be obtained for values of @xmath16 between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath15 was obtained for @xmath19 and is displayed in table  [ fitresults ] .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fiteinasto ] , that the resulting curve for @xmath19 fits very well the rotation curve data for small values of the radius , but does not reproduce its behaviour at larger galactocentric distances .",
    "we also plot in fig .",
    "[ fiteinasto ] the curve obtained with @xmath20 . in this case , the fit results in @xmath21 m@xmath22 kpc@xmath23 and @xmath24 kpc .",
    "although this curve reproduces better the global behaviour of the data , we get a larger value of @xmath25 .",
    "this happens because the small radius points ( with smaller error bars ) are better fitted by the curve with @xmath19 .     for the best - fitting parameters .",
    "the dots show the positions of all the 23 regions.,width=302 ]    in any case , the nfw and the hayashi et al .",
    "profiles fit the rotation curve better than the einasto profile .",
    "the behaviour of these two density profiles ( with the values of the free parameters set to the ones in table  [ fitresults ] ) as a function of the galactocentric distance @xmath26 is shown in fig .",
    "[ nfwhayashi ] .",
    "we can see that the dm densities predicted by the two profiles are practically the same for @xmath27 kpc .",
    "nevertheless , at the largest distance sampled by our background sources , 7.92 kpc , the difference between the two density profiles is much smaller than one order of magnitude : @xmath28 .",
    "we therefore chose to use the hayashi et al .",
    "density profile in our calculations , both because its fit to the data resulted in the lowest value of @xmath15 and because it provides a dm density value lower than the one provided by the nfw profile for most of the regions we are interested in ( conservative choice ) .",
    "while diffusing away from the production site , several energy loss processes act on the @xmath0 fluid .",
    "our calculations accounted only for the three fastest energy loss processes : the synchrotron emission , the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) off the background photons and bremsstrahlung .",
    "we do not include coulomb energy losses .",
    "an electron or a positron with energy @xmath29 diffusing in a region filled with magnetic field @xmath30 will lose energy via synchrotron radiation with the following characteristic time - scale : @xmath31 where @xmath32 s.      similarly , the characteristic time for the ics is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 s and @xmath35 is the energy density of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .    in order to estimate the intensity of the isrf at the position of each region , we used the map of dust temperature ( @xmath36 ) in the lmc presented in @xcite .",
    "the energy density of the isrf is proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "we used @xmath38 @xcite . to obtain the proportionality constant ,",
    "we use the fact that the dust temperature in the solar neighbourhood is 17.5 k and the local value of the isrf is 0.539 ev cm@xmath23 @xcite . we can therefore estimate the the isrf at the position of each one of the 23 regions we are interested in .",
    "following the same conservative approach we adopted in the case of the magnetic field , we impose that the value of the isrf obtained in this way corresponds to its value on the disc , @xmath40 , and assume that , for each region , @xmath41 decays exponentially with @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the disc scale height , which is actually a function that grows with @xmath26 and can be modelled as @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 kpc is the value of the disc scale height in the centre of the lmc and @xmath47 kpc .",
    "table  [ tablercs ] shows the values of @xmath40 for all the 23 regions under study .",
    "the characteristic time for the bremsstrahlung process is given by @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 s and @xmath50 is the hydrogen number density .    to estimate the value of @xmath50 in our selected regions , we used the table of hi clouds in the lmc presented in @xcite , which contains the coordinates , radius and mass of each cloud .",
    "we assumed that the clouds are spherical and estimated their density by simply dividing their mass by the volume of a sphere with the reported radius .",
    "we then checked if each one of the 23 regions fell inside a cloud and , if so , associated to that region the density of the cloud . if a region fell inside more than one cloud , we associated to that region the density of the highest density cloud , which is a conservative choice .",
    "regions that did not fall inside any cloud were assigned with @xmath51 .",
    "the values of @xmath50 for each region obtained in this way are reported in table  [ tablercs ] .",
    "we neglect the contribution of ionised hydrogen in our calculations .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation in view of the depolarisation results obtained in @xcite , which indicate that there are no bright individual hii regions in the directions where the rms were observed .    to include the bremsstrahlung in the calculations , we need to modify the @xmath52 function defined in @xcite to : @xmath53^{-1 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the frequency and @xmath55 hz .    fig .",
    "[ energyloss ] compares the energy loss rate , @xmath56 , for each of the three energy loss processes , at the position of all the 23 regions . for each region",
    ", we plot the values of the normalised energy loss rate for the synchrotron ( calculated using @xmath57 ) , ics and the bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "all the values were evaluated on the plane of the disc ( @xmath58 ) and we used the frequency peak approximation @xmath59 gev , where @xmath57 is measured in @xmath60 g . since the results were very similar for @xmath61 and @xmath62 ghz , we show only the results obtained for 1.4 ghz .",
    "while ics is clearly the dominant process in all regions we are studying , the contribution of bremsstrahlung seems to be the the smallest one .",
    "it is however , surely not negligible in at least 3 regions ( 10 , 11 and 14 ) .",
    "these processes therefore , can not be neglected .",
    "if we remember that the regions are numbered according to their galactocentric distance , we immediately notice in fig .",
    "[ energyloss ] the apparent lack of correlation between the energy loss rates ( and therefore of the magnetic field , the isrf and the hydrogen distribution ) and the galactocentric distance , which is clearly a consequence of the irregular nature of the lmc .",
    "we considered two possible wimps annihilation channels : @xmath63 , in which electrons and positrons will be produced by decaying muons ( @xmath64 ) and anti - muons ( @xmath65 ) produced in pions decays ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) and the leptophilic channel @xmath68 .",
    "leptophilic channels have recently raised interest in view of the experimental results on the electron / positron cosmic ray spectra . while pamela observed an unexpected rise in the positron fraction @xcite , fermi",
    " lat observes a deviation from a simple power - law spectrum @xcite , thus confirming the previous results obtained by hess @xcite .",
    "if these results are to be interpreted as due to dm annihilation in the galactic halo , one needs to consider leptophilic channels and high mass scales .",
    "the synchrotron intensity at a frequency @xmath54 due to dm annihilation coming from a region inside a solid angle @xmath69 on the lmc s disc is : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the disc inclination , @xmath72 is the distance along the line - of - sight and @xmath73 is the synchrotron emissivity at a position in the lmc s halo with galactocentric distance @xmath26 along the disc and height @xmath42 above or below the disc .",

    "we have imposed constraints on the @xmath2-@xmath75 plane using radio observations at 1.4 ghz and 4.8 ghz of the lmc and analysing two different dm annihilation channels , a hadronic and a leptonic one .",
    "the existence of high resolution observations of the lmc in several frequency bands has allowed us to obtain most of the information needed to calculate the dm annihilation signal , making the least possible number of hypotheses in all the steps of the calculation .",
    "being able to escape from this problem and , when necessary , making conservative assumptions , we have , therefore , obtained very robust results .    in all cases",

    "finally , we would like to comment on one possible shortcoming of our analysis .",
    "when fitting the lmc s rotation curve , we took into consideration only the dm mass , ignoring the luminous matter . to understand the effect of this choice , we redid our calculations using the results obtained in @xcite , where an isothermal sphere density profile is fitted to the lmc s rotation curve after subtracting the disc component ( stars + gas ) .",
