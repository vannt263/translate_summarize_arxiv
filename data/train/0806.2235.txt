    "to obtain a model of the population of lmbhbs one needs to follow two steps : ( i ) the time - dependent formation of the population of detached  black - hole + main - sequence star \" binaries and ( ii ) the subsequent evolution of every binary till the hubble time .",
    "the threshold for the masses of black - hole producing binary components is ( 20  25)@xmath25 .",
    "the masses of the secondaries in sxts suggested by their spectral types are @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the sequence of transformations of a binary which results in the formation of a lmbhb may be the following :    the primary component evolves off main - sequence and becomes a supergiant ,    the supergiant overflows roche lobe and forms a common envelope , since mass ratio of components @xmath27 ; if the components do not merge , the primary becomes a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star ,    the wr star explodes as a supernova and forms a black hole .",
    "if the binary is not disrupted by the supernova explosion , a system with a black hole accompanied by a low - mass main - sequence star , i. e. , a lmbhb , is formed . if the separation of components is sufficiently small ( @xmath28 ) , the orbital angular momentum loss ( aml ) via magnetic braking ( mb ) and/or gravitational wave radiation ( gwr ) may bring secondary component of the system to the roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) .",
    "the range of post - common - envelope binary separations which allow the formation of semidetached lmbhbs is very narrow .",
    "hence the probability of formation of a sxt depends very strongly on the physical processes that determine the semi - major axis of the binary , i.e. the stellar winds at all stages of evolution and , especially , the efficiency of ejection of the common envelope . for the latter ,",
    "the ratio of final @xmath29 to initial @xmath30 separations of components is equal to @xcite @xmath31^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the common envelope ejection efficiency , @xmath33   the parameter of the binding energy of the stellar envelope , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the initial mass of the mass - losing star and the mass of its remnant , @xmath36 is the dimensionless radius of the star at the beginning of mass transfer , @xmath37 is the mass of companion . if @xmath38 , then , crudely , @xmath39 .",
    "both terms in the latter expression are highly uncertain ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indirect estimates involving formation scenarios for binaries with neutron - star or black - hole components suggest @xmath40 .",
    "this might mean that sources other than the orbital energy are involved in the ejection of the common envelope , though , the nature of these sources is still not fully understood . in practice , @xmath41 remains a parameter , tuning of which allows reproducing the properties of specific systems or stellar populations .    in the second step of modeling ,",
    "the evolution of every system is followed taking into account the aml via gravitational wave radiation and/or magnetic stellar wind ( msw ) and , if necessary , nuclear evolution of the main - sequence star .",
    "in and @xcite was carried out the population synthesis for galactic lmbhbs for three values of @xmath42 : 0.1 , 0.5 and 2 .",
    "we refer the reader to these papers for the details of the computations .",
    "two main conclusions were drawn from the models computed in these studies .",
    "first , the model for @xmath430.1 is not compatible with observations of sxts since in this case the overwhelming majority of black holes has masses @xmath44 , exceeding the largest estimated black hole mass in known sxts ( @xmath45 for a0620 - 500 , see * ? ? ?",
    "second , if the aml via mb for lmbhbs is treated in a `` standard '' way , assuming after that for components of close binaries the braking law for single field stars @xcite can be extrapolated over the range of rotational velocities from several 10 to several 100 km / s and that the spin - orbit coupling is efficient , model mass - transfer rates for lmbhbs at @xmath46hr are so high that these systems might have stable hot discs according to the disc instability model ( dim ) criterion of @xcite .",
    "but such stable and bright lmbhbs have not been observed .    a strong reduction of the magnetic braking efficiency in close binaries as compared to single stars",
    "is suggested also by the data on stellar rotation in young open clusters @xcite and the mass transfer rates in cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in and @xcite we computed a population model of lmbhbs assuming that mb stops operating once the rlof occurs ( `` no - mb '' model ) .",
    "we found that the number of galactic lmbhbs remains of the same order of magnitude as in the case with active mb ( several 1000 ) but all systems are transient .    in and @xcite we compared the @xmath432 `` no - mb '' model with observations .",
    "below , we present the model for @xmath430.5 . in this case , the number of lmbhbs that reach contact in hubble time and evolve to @xmath47hr is @xmath48 and @xmath49 of them have currently @xmath50hr .",
    "have @xmath51 and the character of mass exchange in them is unclear because of the effect of resonances , see for details . ] for comparison , in the model for @xmath52 2 these numbers are about 12000 and 5000 , respectively .",
    "when spectral types of the secondaries in observed sxts are known , one can evaluate their effective temperatures and masses and to compare them with model predictions .",
    "inevitably , such a comparison may be only crude , since the spectra of the secondaries are contaminated by the radiation of accretion disks and hot spots and we have at our disposal @xmath53 and @xmath54 relations for main - sequence stars only ( relations from * ? ? ? *",
    "were used ) . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pte ] we plot the effective temperatures of donor - stars in modeled systems as a function of orbital period and compare them with the ranges of @xmath55 inferred from the spectral types of donors in sxts .",
    "having in mind uncertainties in the spectral type determinations and @xmath56 scale , we find that the model satisfactorily reproduces @xmath57 of the donors in the lmbhbs with @xmath58 hr .    in our models",
    "the efficiency of magnetic braking is 0 . in reality",
    "some mb might be acting as , probably , in the case of cataclysmic variables ( see , for instance , * ? ? ? * but also [ mtr ] below ) .",
    "we show in fig . [",
    "fig : pte ] two `` limiting '' tracks : for the system with initial masses of components 1 and 12 @xmath25 and post - circularization period @xmath59 day in which the donor is almost unevolved at rlof and mb does not act after rlof and for a ( 1 + 4)@xmath25 , @xmath60 day system in which at rlof donor has hydrogen abundance in the center @xmath61 and the mb continues to operate during mass - transfer with an efficiency corresponding to law .",
    "crudely , if the efficiency of mb is not 0 , the model population must be located between these two limiting curves .",
    "of course there will be a contribution from lower and higher mass systems , as we plotted the 1@xmath62 tracks for simplicity only .",
    "adding some mb to our model will shift the population to the right , providing a better agreement with observations . adding moderate mb will influence mainly the long - period systems , without producing stable systems .",
    "a similar satisfactory agreement of model populations with observations is found for the masses of secondaries of sxts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pte ] , right panel ) .",
    "we note that , since for large initial @xmath63 the transformation of separation of components in common envelopes depends linearly on @xmath41 , the distributions of model populations in @xmath64 and @xmath65 plots are similar for @xmath41=0.5 and 2 , and only differ by the density of points per unit area of the diagrams .",
    "there are sxts with @xmath66 ( 812 ) hr ",
    "grs  1009 - 45 , xte  1650 - 500 , a0620 - 00 , and gs  2000 + 25 , which , apparently , are located below the `` populated '' area in fig .",
    "[ fig : pte ] .",
    "however , we should note that in our modeling we tried to avoid the effect of bifurcation of evolutionary tracks  evolution of systems to shorter or longer periods upon rlof , depending on the extent of hydrogen depletion in the cores of the models .",
    "for this reason we restricted ourselves to systems evolving to shorter @xmath67 only .",
    "however , our computations show that , if gwr is the sole sink of angular momentum , binaries with @xmath68 and @xmath69 evolve to longer periods if at the instant of rlof their secondaries have @xmath70 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pte ] by evolutionary tracks for initially ( 1.1 + 4)@xmath71 systems in which secondaries have , respectively , @xmath72 0.45 and 0.37 at the rlof .",
    "the latter binary spends several gyr evolving to longer periods .",
    "initial ( post - circularization of the binary after supernova explosion ) orbital periods of these two binaries @xmath73 differ by 0.1 day only . since the distribution of the binaries over @xmath73 is continuous , this proximity of initial parameters of the binaries and striking difference in their evolutionary behavior suggests a possibility of explaining the origin and parameters of sxts with @xmath74hr .",
    "this conjecture has yet to be confirmed by detailed modeling .",
    "an estimate of mass - transfer rate in an sxts may be obtained by dividing the mass accreted during outburst by the recurrence time . however ,",
    "( i ) recurrence times are known for a0620 - 00 ( about 60 yr ) and 4u  1543 - 47 ( about 10 yr ) only ; ( ii ) it is not evident that the rate calculated this way represents the secular value , and ( iii ) this method of estimate assumes that between outbursts , when accretion disc is  refilled \" , accretion onto black hole does not occur . the last assumption is put in doubt both by observations and models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) which suggest that quiescent discs in sxts are truncated and therefore leaky . in the latter case , mass - transfer rate can not be larger than the critical - for - stability accretion rate at the truncation radius .",
    "the actual mass - transfer rate should be between the values estimated by the two methods .",
    "using the expression for the critical accretion rate @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is viscosity parameter and @xmath77 is disc radius in units of @xmath78 cm , we obtain for the upper limit of mass - transfer rate @xmath79^{10.32 } p_d^{1.72}f_t^{2.58}~~\\rm m_{\\sun}\\ , yr^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath80  orbital period in days , @xmath81  fractional disc truncation radius .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdmdt ] we compare the model mass - transfer rates with the estimates obtained by the two above mentioned methods .",
    "the `` leaky disc '' estimates of @xmath82 for xte j1118 + 480 , gro j0422 + 32 , and grs  1009 - 45 strongly suggest that the aml in short - period lmbhbs might be really defined by gwr only .",
    "we calculated models of the galactic population of short - period low - mass black - hole binaries which are identified with soft x - ray transients .",
    "we found that using the values of the common - envelope parameter @xmath41 between @xmath83 and assuming a strongly reduced magnetic braking it is possible to reproduce , ( within the uncertainty of observations ) the number of the lmbhbs in the galaxy and the effective temperatures and masses of the donors in these systems ( as inferred from the spectra of the stars ) .",
    "the above mentioned values of @xmath41 imply that the common - envelope expulsion in the progenitors of sxts has to be very efficient and that sources other than orbital energy may be required in this process .",
