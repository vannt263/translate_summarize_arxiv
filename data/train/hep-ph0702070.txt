    "in this and next sections the reasons for disagreement indicated above are studied . if @xmath122 , system ( 7 ) is certainly correct .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to revise the role of @xmath123 .",
    "this question has been considered in [ 1 ] .",
    "taking into account the importance of this problem , we adduce more direct evidence using the @xmath61-operator only .",
    "the approach based on the evolution operator is more general than the @xmath29-matrix one , since in this case the time - dependence of the process does not need to be @xmath124 ( see ( 8) ) .",
    "also it is infrared - free , which is essential for @xmath50 transitions [ 13 ] .",
    "the non - hermiticity of @xmath11 implies that @xmath125 @xmath126 , resulting in @xmath127 because the value of @xmath128 is extremely small : @xmath129 where the standard set [ 1 , 14 - 16 ] of parameters @xmath55 , @xmath130 and @xmath56 has been used .",
    "we thus see that ( 8) is invalid .    for the @xmath29-matrix ,",

    "( b ) the physical meaning of @xmath132 is uncertain because it is clarified using relation ( 20 ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize this fact .",
    "on the one hand , the @xmath0 transition probability is very small ( see ( 19 ) ) , and on the other hand , the term @xmath123 plays a crucial role because it enters the leading diagram ( see ( 13 ) ) . because of this for the problem under study the unitarity of the @xmath29-matrix is of particular importance .",
    "thus , the non - hermitian hamiltonian ( 3 ) leads to inverse @xmath56-dependence of @xmath34 and to the imaginary self - energy . in qed",

    "the notation of the `` running width '' has been introduced .    the importance of unitarity condition is well known [ 17,18 ] .",

    "this is obvious because the absorption can be considered as the decay of a one - particle state .",
    "formally , in these cases all the results are also true .",
    "nevertheless , the resonances invite an additional consideration . as far back as 1959",
    ", m. levy remarked that there does not exist a rigorous theory to which various phenomenological methods of treating resonances and decays can be considered as approximations [ 19 ] .",
    "attempts have been made at an axiomatic theory [ 20,21 ] .",
    "the above - mentioned difficulties take place for absorption as well .",
    "these conceptual problems are beyond the scope of this paper",
    ". we deal with concrete models ( 3)-(5 ) and hence propagator ( 13 ) because they are frequently used . as for resonances and decays , we only draw the formal analogy between absorption hamiltonian ( 3 ) and phenomenological hamiltonian of decay @xmath139 .",
    "we also note that decay ( 14 ) can be calculated by means of the usual field - theoretical approach , but the problem should be formulated on the finite time interval [ 22 ] since fig .",
    "4a contains an infrared singularity .",
    "the problem is not only in the unitarity .",
    "it is in the correct description of the absorption on the whole . in the theory of optical potential @xmath31 is non - hermitian as well .",
    "however , the picture differs principally in this case . in this section",

    "the wave function of the @xmath47-particle is @xmath194 , where @xmath181 is the 4-momentum of the particle . as with @xmath195 ,",
    "the decay hamiltonian is taken in the scalar form @xmath196 and correspondingly @xmath197 @xmath198 is dimensionless .",
    "the process amplitude is given by @xmath199 here @xmath200 is the annihilation amplitude , @xmath183 is the antineutron mass , @xmath180 is the 4-momentum of the @xmath33-particle",
    ".    for simplicity assume that @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the mass of the @xmath47-particle .",
    "it is easy to estimate the width of decay ( 1 ) : @xmath203 the corresponding decay probability is proportional to @xmath56 : @xmath204 the index @xmath205 signifies that the hermitian hamiltonian is used .",
    "the width of process ( 2 ) is also linear in @xmath56 [ 1 ] : @xmath206 for the hamiltonians containing three terms the @xmath56-dependence of @xmath207 is the same .",

    "it is justified for the problems described by schrodinger type equations .",

    "the effect of absorption , as a rule , acts in the opposite ( wrong ) direction , which leads to additional suppression . in particular , model ( 5 ) gives rise to the dramatic suppression of @xmath0 transitions due to the annihilation in the final state , which is wrong .",

    "alternatively , in the phenomenological model the @xmath0 conversion is described by system ( 7 ) which has an exact solution . for these reasons",
    "the @xmath214 transitions in the medium are the ideal instrument for the study of the final state absorption .",
    "we also emphasize the following : the absorption ( decay ) in the final state ( figs .",
    "1b , 2b and 4a , for example ) does not lead to suppress the total process probability as well as the probability of the channel corresponding to absorption , in contrast to the phenomenological model results .",
