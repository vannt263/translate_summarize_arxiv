    "hd189733 is currently the brightest ( @xmath0 ) star known to harbour a transiting exoplanet .",
    "this , along with the short period ( 2.2 days ) and large ratio of planet - to - star radii ( @xmath1 ) , makes it very suitable for different types of observations including polarimetry @xcite . in this paper",
    "we model the polarimetric effect that occurs during the planetary transit in front of the stellar disk .",
    "the planetary transit breaks the symmetry of the distribution of light coming from the stellar disk which results in the net linear polarization .",
    "this effect was simulated first by @xcite for artificial exoplanetary systems who revealed that the accuracy of modern polarimeters of @xmath2 is enough to detect it .",
    "later , @xcite and @xcite calculated the planetary transit effect for hd189733 with monte carlo simulations taking into account two different types of center - to - limb variations of linear polarization ( clvp ) of the host star as initial approximations such as the clvp for pure scattering atmosphere @xcite and the solar clvp @xcite .",
    "they showed that result of such simulation strongly depends on clvp of the stellar disk .",
    "so far , the efforts to study the clvp are concentrated only for the sun ( e.g. , etc ... ) while there is no information about the clvp for cooler dwarf stars . in this paper , we present our calculations of the clvi and clvp which are obtained by solving the radiative transfer equations for polarized light taking into account various opacities . using results of these calculations ,",
    "we simulate polarization resulting from the planetary transit and stellar spots in hd189733 . in section 2 , we describe our method of calculation of the clvi and clvp for hd189733 and in section 3 we show results of our transit polarization simulations .",
    "section 4 presents discussion of our results .",
    "we solve the radiative transfer equations for polarized radiation iteratively assuming no magnetic field and considering a plane - parallel model atmosphere ( see @xcite ) .    as the stellar model atmosphere of hd189733 we use the phoenix model @xcite with effective temperature @xmath3 and gravity @xmath4 .",
    "scattering and absorption continuum opacities are calculated using the sloc code @xcite at the wavelength of 4500 . we take into account the following contributors :    * scattering opacity : thomson scattering on free electrons and rayleigh scattering on @xmath5 , and other molecules , * absorption opacity : free - free and bound - free transitions in @xmath6 , and metal photoionization .    with these contributors ,",
    "the calculated clvi and clvp in the continuum spectrum of hd189733 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_clv ] .",
    "in addition , we consider the solar clvi and clvp @xcite and the clvs calculated by @xcite for pure scattering atmosphere .    .",
    "]    as is seen in fig.[fig_clv ] , the continuum polarization for hd189733 is slightly larger than for the sun , while it is significantly smaller than the polarization calculated in @xcite for pure scattering atmosphere . we conclude that neither chandrasekhar s calculation nor the solar clvp can reproduce correctly the clv of the polarization for the k dwarf star hd189733 .",
    "using monte carlo simulations following @xcite and @xcite and taking into account the clvi and clvp calculated for hd189733 as described in section 2 , we obtain the variation of the flux , the normalized stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 parameters and the polarization degree during the planetary transit ( fig .",
    "[ fig_poldegree ] , first column ) .",
    "the flux and polarization curves are sensitive to orbit inclination angle and ratio of planet - to - star radii .",
    "the flux provides the planet - to - star radii ratio and the inclination angle , while polarimetry provides also the information in which south or north hemisphere the planet transits the star . the value and the sign of stokes q and u describe the position of the planet on the stellar disk projected onto the sky plane . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_poldegree ] ( first column ) the variation of the polarization degree is symmetric and the maxima are slightly larger than @xmath9 at 4500  .",
    "another effect that breaks the symmetry of the host star disk and results in linear polarization is the presence of spots on the stellar disk . as was shown by @xcite",
    ", hd189733 is an active star and spots can cover up to 1% of the total stellar surface .",
    "in our simulation we set different parameters of spots such as temperature ( @xmath10 ) , sizes ( up to 1% of the stellar surface ) and locations ( chosen randomly in the range of latitudes of @xmath11 to @xmath12 ) .",
    "the clvi and clvp for spots are calculated for phoenix model atmosphere with adopted effective temperatures and gravities .",
    "thus , we calculate the flux and polarization variations contributing from stellar activity which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_poldegree ] ( second and third columns ) . in both columns for times before and after the planet transit , we obtain a flux decrease and a polarization increase caused only by spots present on the stellar disk .",
    "the variation of the polarization provides information about the position of starspots . since the polarization of the star is the largest at the limb , fig .",
    "[ fig_poldegree ] ( second column ) shows simulation for the extreme case of the biggest possible spot at the limb for hd189733 . in this case , the polarization due to the spot is the largest polarization degree @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite assumed the same extreme starspot parameters and estimated the maximum polarization from spot up to @xmath14 which is in very good agreement with our simulations .",
    "the third column of the fig .",
    "[ fig_poldegree ] shows the same parameters as the other two columns but for another distribution of starspots .",
    "in this case we distribute 8 spots more or less homogeneously over the stellar disk between the latitudes @xmath11 to @xmath12 with the total area covered by spots of about 1% of the stellar disk .",
    "it is seen , that the cases of the spotless star and the star with the distributed spots lead to very similar signals in all panels which mostly differ by vertical offsets of @xmath15 which corresponds to the signal from the spots .",
    "we would like to draw your attention that in fig.[fig_poldegree ] ( third column ) at t=1.7h the planet covers one of the spots which leads to little bumps in all the curves below .",
    "in this paper , we calculate the center - to - limb variations of the intensity and linear polarization in stellar continuous for hd189733 . similar to limb darkening measurements in transit photometry",
    ", we show that it is possible to measure the center - to - limb variations of the linear polarization by means of transit polarimetry .",
    "transit polarimetry provides information about the ratio of planet - to - star radii , orbit inclination and the transit hemisphere .",
    "in addition , it constrains the sizes and positions of starspots on the stellar disk , while transit photometry can not , unless the planet covers a spot during its transit .    using monte carlo simulations we also obtain the linear polarization for the transiting exoplanetary system hd189733 with the found maximum equal to @xmath16 at 4500 . in order to measure this effect for hd189733",
    "we need a very sensitive polarimeter .",
    "we show that the maximum polarization effect due to starspots is still less than @xmath17 for a single spot seen at the stellar limb and even smaller for a more homogeneous distribution of spots over the surface .",
    "thus , the influence of the spots on the total polarization for hd189733 is too small to be measurable .",
    "it requires many planetary transit observations in order to achieve better statistics and polarimetric accuracy .",
