    "uncertainty relations are a key item of the quantum theory .",
    "this is from fundamental reasons , but also regarding practical applications , since phase - number uncertainty relations are the heart of the quantum limits to the precision of signal detection schemes @xcite .",
    "typically , uncertainty relations are expressed in terms of variances and are derived directly from the heisenberg form of commutation relations . however",
    ", this approach is not always useful . on the one hand , variance may not be a suitable uncertainty measure .",
    "this is specially clear regarding periodic phase - angle variables @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase may not admit a simple well - behaved operator description suitable to obey a heisenberg form of commutation relations with the number operator @xcite .",
    "this has lead to the introduction of alternative uncertainty relations @xcite , some of them involving characteristic functions @xcite .    in this regard ,",
    "a recent work has proposed an uncertainty relation for position and momentum based on characteristic functions , which is derived directly from the weyl form of commutation relations @xcite . in this work",
    "we translate this approach to phase - number variables . despite the problems that quantum phase encounters",
    ", a very fundamental approach admits without difficulties the weyl form of commutation relations and has well - defined characteristic functions .",
    "therefore , the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite is a quite interesting formulation particularly suited to phase - angle variables .",
    "we also show that this encounters fundamental ambiguities when contrasting different slightly different alternative implementations , as it also holds for other approaches @xcite .",
    "let us point out that the weyl form is equivalent to say that every system state experiences a global phase shift after a cyclic transformation in the corresponding phase space .",
    "this implies that the quantum structure including uncertainty relations might be traced back to a geometric phase @xcite .",
    "let us consider general systems describable in a finite - dimensional space as a spin @xmath0 .",
    "this admits very general scenarios , including especially the phase difference between two modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this is because the total number of photons @xmath1 is compatible with the phase difference and defines finite - dimensional subspaces of dimension @xmath2 , where @xmath1 plays the role of the spin modulus as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "let us focus on a spin component @xmath4 and the canonically conjugate phase @xmath5 .",
    "to avoid periodicity problems we focus on the complex exponential of @xmath5 , we shall call @xmath6 , this is @xmath7 .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath8 can be referred to as phase states @xcite , being latexmath:[\\[| \\tilde{m } \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2j+1 } } \\sum_{m =- j}^j e^ { -i \\frac{2 \\pi}{2j+1 } m \\tilde{m } }    @xmath4 , as usual @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "likewise , we may define the exponential of @xmath4 as @xmath12 these exponentials @xmath6 and @xmath13 are quite suited to the weyl form of commutation relation @xcite @xmath14 for any @xmath15 .",
    "it is worth noting that the weyl form has a quite interesting meaning when expressed as @xmath16 this represents a cyclic transformation in the form of a closed excursion over a @xmath17 rectangle in the associated phase space for the problem .",
    "the result is that every system state acquires a global phase after returning to the starting point .    following ref .",
    "@xcite we can construct the gram matrix @xmath18 for the following three vectors @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an arbitrary state assumed pure for simplicity and without loss of generality , so that @xmath21 involving the characteristic functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 which is the term invoking the weyl commutator ( [ ws ] ) .",
    "after the positive semi - definiteness of @xmath18 we get @xmath24 where @xmath25 . from this point",
    "we can follow exactly the same steps in ref .",
    "these involve to construct another gram matrix after replacing @xmath26 by @xmath27 and @xmath28 by @xmath29 , adding the two determinants , using eq .",
    "( [ ws ] ) and then following some clever simple algebraic bounds .",
    "this leads to @xmath30 with @xmath31 therefore , most of the analysis and results found in ref .",
    "@xcite could be translated here .",
    "even , the limit of vanishing argument of the characteristic functions may be reproduced in the limit of very large @xmath0 .    besides the sums , uncertainty relations can be also formulated as the products of uncertainty estimators . in our case from eq .",
    "( [ urs ] ) we can readily derive a bound for the product of characteristic functions @xmath32 a rather interesting point is that this can lead to conclusions fully opposite to the sum relation ( [ urs ] ) .",
    "this is specially so regarding the minimum uncertainty states , as we shall clearly show by some examples below .",
    "the smallest value for the bound @xmath33 is obtained for @xmath34 .",
    "in such a case , the sum of the two gram matrices commented above leads directly to the uncertainty relation @xmath35 where the @xmath36 term is expressing phase - number correlations that in standard variance - based approaches is expressed by the the anti - commutator .",
    "if this correlation term is ignored we get the more plain relations : @xmath37    let us note that these relations might be called _ certainty _ instead of _ uncertainty _ relations since we get upper bounds for characteristic functions , that take their maximum value when there is full certainty about the corresponding variable .",
    "the most simple and illustrative example is provided by the case @xmath38 .",
    "the most general state is of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the pauli matrices , @xmath41 is the identity , and @xmath42 is a three - dimensional real vector with @xmath43 .",
    "we can chose the basis so that @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ". the only nontrivial uncertainty relation holds for @xmath46 so that @xmath34 , @xmath47 @xmath48 and eqs .",
    "( [ urs ] ) , ( [ urt ] ) , and ( [ urp ] ) become , respectively @xmath49 actually , @xmath50 is a well - known duality relation expressing complementarity @xcite .",
    "the minimum uncertainty both for eqs .",
    "( [ urs ] ) and ( [ urt ] ) holds for every pure state @xmath51 with @xmath52 .    turning our attention to the alternative product of characteristic functions in eq .",
    "( [ urp ] ) we get that the minimum uncertainty states are those pure states with @xmath52 and @xmath53 . on the other hand ,",
    "the states with @xmath52 and @xmath54 or @xmath55 are of maximum uncertainty , contrary to the predictions of the sum relations ( [ urs ] ) and ( [ urt ] ) .",
    "next we address the case of the number and phase for a single field mode .",
    "there is always the possibility of addressing this from the number and phase difference taking a suitable reference state in one of the modes @xcite , but the direct approach has also its advantages .",
    "one of them is that it faces the fact that , roughly speaking , there is no phase operator .",
    "the exponential of the phase is not unitary , but represented instead by the one - sided unitary susskind - glogower operator @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the eigenstates of the number operator @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the phase states @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the orthogonal projector on the subspace with less than @xmath26 photons @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the identity .",
    "this does not prevent the existence of a proper probability distribution for the phase in any field state @xmath64 .",
    "this can be defined thanks to the phase states ( [ ps ] ) as @xmath65 , that lead to the characteristic function @xmath66 where the last equality holds because for all @xmath26 @xmath67 in spite of the fact that the phase states are not orthogonal .",
    "this is to say that the lack of unitarity is equivalent to a description of phase in terms of a positive - operator measure .    despite the lack of unitarity of @xmath68",
    "there is also a suitable weyl form of commutation relations @xmath69 since the operator @xmath6 is not unitary , the change of @xmath26 by @xmath27 is not trivial , so in order to follow the procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite we have to construct explicitly the two gram matrices .",
    "the first one for the vectors @xmath70 is @xmath71 with @xmath72 being in this case @xmath73 @xmath25 , and @xmath74    the second gram matrix corresponds to the change of @xmath5 by @xmath75 and @xmath26 by @xmath27 , so the three vectors are now @xmath76 leading to @xmath77 where eqs .",
    "( [ wpn ] ) and ( [ lu ] ) have been used , being @xmath78 and the same @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath36 in eqs .",
    "( [ phitphi ] ) and ( [ om ] ) .",
    "this leads to the determinant    @xmath81    for the same @xmath82 above .    at this point",
    "several routes can be followed .",
    "for definiteness from now on we will focus always in the most stringent scenario of @xmath83 .",
    "in such a case we readily get from the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ detg+ ] ) and ( [ detg- ] ) the following bound : @xmath84 the lack of unitarity of the exponential of the phase reflects in the presence of the @xmath85 term .",
    "thus , whenever this term is absent @xmath86 we recover the same expressions obtained for the spin - like systems . otherwise , this term might be also moved to the right - hand side of the relation meaning that the nonunitarity implies a lower upper bound in accordance with the noisy nature of positive - operator measures .    for definiteness , on what follows we will consider the following forms @xmath87 and @xmath88 as well as the product @xmath89      readily simple examples are provided by the eigenstates of @xmath58 and @xmath6 . for the number states",
    "@xmath57 we get for all @xmath5 , @xmath26 and @xmath90 that @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and there is no effect of the @xmath85 term .",
    "thus these are minimum uncertainty states .",
    "note that we have the opposite conclusions regarding the uncertainty product .",
    "on the other hand , the phase states @xmath93 do not provide a suitable example since they are not normalizable .",
    "instead , we can use their normalized counterparts , that are also eigenstates of @xmath6 @xmath94 .",
    "these states can be suitably approached in practice via quadrature squeezed states @xcite .    in this case",
    "it can be readily seen that @xmath95 and @xmath96 in fig .",
    "1 we have represented the combinations @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 in eqs .",
    "( [ up ] ) and ( [ upp ] ) as functions of @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the minima of these functions represent maximum uncertainty and hold for phase states with very small mean number of photons , i. e. , @xmath103 , and 1.3 , for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , respectively . on the other hand , when @xmath104 , this is when @xmath105 , we get @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , as expected for ideal phase states , becoming minimum uncertainty states .",
    "( solid ) , @xmath98 ( dashed ) , and @xmath99 ( dotted ) as functions of @xmath109 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 for the phase states ( [ pc]).,width=226 ]    however when considering the product @xmath110 in eq . ( [ v ] )",
    "again for @xmath101 and @xmath102 it can be easily seen after eq .",
    "( [ pc1 ] ) that when @xmath104 and @xmath111 we get maximum uncertainty @xmath112 , while @xmath110 attains its maximum value ( i. e. , minimum uncertainty ) , @xmath113 , when @xmath114 , this is @xmath115 .",
    "thus we see another clear example where maximum and minimum uncertainty states exchange their roles depending on the assessment of joint uncertainty considered .",
    "states with gaussian statistics are usually minimum uncertainty states in typical variance - based uncertainty relations . then it is worth examining the case in which the number statistics can be approximated by a gaussian distribution .",
    "this will work provided that the distribution is concentrated in large photon numbers and that it is smooth enough so that the number @xmath90 can be treated as a continuous variable .",
    "thus let us consider a pure state @xmath116 with @xmath117 , \\ ] ] where @xmath118 represents the mean number , @xmath119 is given by the inverse of the number variance @xmath120 , and @xmath121 provides phase - number correlations taking positive as well as negative values . consistently with the above approximations we shall consider @xmath122 as well as @xmath123",
    "this situation includes the glauber coherent states @xmath124 for large enough mean photon numbers @xmath125 with @xmath126 . throughout @xmath127 will be assumed .    in these conditions",
    "we readily get @xmath128 , \\ ] ] and @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "the first thing we can notice is that @xmath121 increases phase uncertainty .",
    "let us begin with the simplest case @xmath126 .",
    "we can focus first on the plain sum relation @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ up ] ) , which is plotted in fig . 2 in solid line as a function of @xmath119 .",
    "we can see that @xmath131 is just a function of @xmath132 and that minimum uncertainty , this is maximum @xmath97 , holds for @xmath132 tending both to 0 and infinity : this is when the state tends to be phase or number state , respectively , in accordance with the above results . in between",
    "we get a maximum uncertainty state , i. e. , minimum @xmath97 , when @xmath133 that correspond to @xmath134 , this is uncertainty equally split between phase and number .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath98 in the same eq .",
    "( [ up ] ) , as shown in fig . 2 in dashed line .",
    "( solid ) and @xmath98 ( dashed ) as functions of @xmath135 for gaussian states with @xmath126.,width=226 ]    on the other hand , the situation is quite the opposite for the certainty product @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) : we have maximum uncertainty @xmath112 for phase and number states @xmath136 , while we have minimum uncertainty , this is maximum @xmath110 , for @xmath137 .",
    "this is just the opposite of the conclusion of the sum of characteristics .    for the case @xmath138 in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted the certainty sums @xmath97 and @xmath98 as functions of @xmath121 for @xmath139 and @xmath101 , showing that from @xmath126 increasing @xmath121 increases uncertainty until reaching @xmath140 where a revival of @xmath98 is produced , reaching the same certainty values around @xmath126 . regarding the product @xmath110 we have the same behavior of the case @xmath126 but",
    "the minimum uncertainty state holds for @xmath141 .",
    "( solid ) and @xmath98 ( dashed ) as functions of @xmath121 for @xmath101 and gaussian states with @xmath139.the two lines overlap around @xmath126.,width=226 ]      looking for states with interesting phase - number relations we may consider the eigenstates of @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is a real parameter @xcite : @xmath145 that has the following solution , for @xmath146 for definiteness , @xmath147 are the corresponding modified bessel functions",
    ".    it could be interesting to apply the previous approach to these states ( [ i1 ] ) looking for the @xmath144 that lead to minimum uncertainty .",
    "easily we obtain : @xmath148 and @xmath149 as before , we focus on the case @xmath101 and @xmath150 . performing the numerical computation , we obtain plots of @xmath97 and @xmath151 in eq .",
    "( [ up ] ) similar to the ones obtained in previous cases , as we can see in fig .",
    "the maximum uncertainty states are given by the minimum value of @xmath97 and @xmath151 for a given @xmath26 . in the present case",
    "the values of @xmath144 which minimizes these functions are @xmath152 with @xmath153 , and @xmath154 with @xmath155 , respectively .",
    "here again we obtain opposite results for the certainty product @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "( solid ) and @xmath98 ( dashed ) as functions of @xmath144 for the states ( [ i1]).,width=226 ]      joint uncertainty relations of two observables are often minimized by states with properties somewhat intermediate between the two observables .",
    "the simplest case is a readily coherent superposition of number and phase states of the form @xmath156 we focus on the case @xmath157 and @xmath158 with the idea that @xmath159 approaches the ideal phase states ( [ ps ] ) .",
    "in such a case it can be seen that the normalization condition is just @xmath160 and we shall consider @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ com ] ) reads @xmath161 minimum uncertainty holds just in the limiting cases @xmath162 and @xmath163 , recovering the cases of phase and number states . on the other hand maximum uncertainty holds for the intermediate state @xmath164 .",
    "clearly , the situation is reversed if we consider the product @xmath110 so that maximum and minimum uncertainty are exchanged .",
    "we have successfully derived meaningful phase - number uncertainty relations from the weyl form of commutation relations .",
    "this can be applied to study phase - number statistical properties of meaningful field states , especially intermediate states that have already demonstrated interesting properties regarding uncertainty relations @xcite .    moreover",
    ", this can be a suitable tool to explore quantum metrology limits .",
    "in typical interferometry @xmath58 is the generator of phase shifts .",
    "thus the characteristic function @xmath79 is actually expressing the distinguishability of the probe state before and after a phase shift , which should be naturally related to detection resolution .",
    "therefore this uncertainty relations may be connected to optimized signal detection schemes @xcite .",
