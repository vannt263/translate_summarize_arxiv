    "since spite & spite ( 1982 ) discovered that the oldest , warm halo dwarfs in the galaxy all show almost the same @xmath0li abundance , several papers have appeared in the literature supporting their initial interpretation that this is the primordial abundance of @xmath0li ( spite , maillard & spite , 1984 ; spite & spite , 1986 ; rebolo , molaro & beckman , 1988 , hereafter rmb ; but see also thorburn , 1994 ) .",

    "; hobbs & thorburn , 1997 ; cayrel et al . , 1999 ) and perhaps bd+422667 ( cayrel et al . , 1999 ) , are the arguments for claiming that no significant depletion mechanisms should have acted in these stars to modify the pristine @xmath0li abundance ( but see also ryan , norris & beers , 1999 ) .",
    "we also note a competing theory , which claims that the highest @xmath0li abundance - measured in the most li - rich population i objects - is the primordial one ( boesgaard et al . , 1998 ) . in this case",
    "some depletion mechanisms able to deplete li in all the halo stars by the same amount acting on a galactic lifetime timescale are required .",
    "possible mechanisms include diffusion ( vauclair , 1988 ) , rotational mixing ( pinsonneault et al . , 1992 ) and stellar winds ( vauclair and charbonnel , 1995 ) .",
    "recently , fields & olive ( 1998 ) , using a standard model of galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) nucleosynthesis , found that only little @xmath3li ( and @xmath0li ) depletion is allowed in halo stars . so that the observed spite plateau should be indicative of the primordial li abundance .",

    "therefore , some mechanisms of @xmath0li production are required to increase the li abundance from the plateau value to the present one .",
    "nuclear reactions in stellar interiors and spallation processes on interstellar medium ( ism ) particles involving either high or low energy gcrs have both been proposed as possible mechanisms able to synthesize @xmath0li and restore it back to the ism , where it enters into the chemical composition of the new - formed stars .",
    "lithium evolution has already been studied in detail by several authors .",
    "dantona & matteucci ( 1991 ) , by means of a complete model of chemical evolution , have shown that both the solar system lithium abundance and the rise from the spite plateau could be explained assuming li - production in classical novae and agb stars .",
    "later , novae were ruled out as lithium producers at a galactic level ( boffin et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "matteucci et al.(1995 ) suggested a combination of @xmath6-process nucleosynthesis from type ii sne and hot bottom burning in intermediate mass agb stars to match the observations .",
    "recently , matteucci et al.(1999 ) used the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions to calculate the expected @xmath0li content in the galactic bulge .",
    "lithium production by low mass agb stars ( c - stars ) and standard gcr nucleosynthesis were the key ingredients of the model of abia et al.(1995 ) , which was able to match also the behaviour of the lithium isotopic ratio .",
    "in any case , they had to require a percentage of li - rich c - stars much higher ( 68% ) than observed ( 23% ) . however , we note that c - stars at low metallicities are found much more numerous ( @xmath1 10% , beers et al . , 1992 ; norris et al . ,",

    "in this paper we deal with galactic lithium evolution taking into account the lithium production both in stars and from gcrs .",

    "the observed evolution of the @xmath0li abundance with metallicity , when abundance determinations in disk and halo dwarfs are restricted to stars with effective temperature t@xmath7 @xmath8 5700 k , suggests that there is a general trend towards a larger ism @xmath0li content with increasing metallicity . in previous papers ( e.g. matteucci et al . , 1995 , 1999 )",
    "the abundances used to constrain galactic chemical evolution models were pointing to a smooth increase from the spite plateau to the solar system value . in this paper",
    "we show the results of an analysis performed on a large selection of data taken from the literature .",
    "li detections for those stars which are tracing the upper envelope of the observational a(li ) vs [ fe / h ] diagram have been critically analysed and a rise off the plateau steeper than previously assumed has been found .",
    "this result , coupled with a spite plateau which extends towards larger metallicities , suggests a revision of the various contributions to the @xmath0li production from different sources . in particular , @xmath0li producers restoring their lithium to the ism on long timescales should be preferred .",

    "this region is particularly interesting because it is the metallicity range where the observed lithium abundance is expected to start growing due to @xmath0li injection from the first li factories .    from the point of view of stellar nucleosynthesis ,",
    "it is important to determine the metallicity at which the li abundance starts rising off the spite plateau .",
    "for instance , the constancy of the spite plateau at [ fe / h ] @xmath9 @xmath21.5 translates into the requirement that type ii sne coming from the first stellar generations should contribute only an amount of lithium smaller than the primordial one .",
    "selection criteria have been applied in order to remove from the sample all those stars which are likely to have passed through phases during which they either destroyed or diluted their initial lithium content . to this purpose , we selected only stars not suffering any @xmath0li convective depletion , i.e. t@xmath7 @xmath8 5700 k , according to standard models .",

    "for each bin the data were compared with theoretical isochrones appropriately chosen for different ages at different metallicities . in the bin [ fe / h ] @xmath8 @xmath20.75 we used the isochrones of 29 gyr ; in the bin @xmath21.25 @xmath9 [ fe / h ] @xmath9 @xmath20.75 the 619 gyr isochrones , and in the bin [ fe / h ] @xmath9 @xmath21.25 those of 820 gyr .",

    "this interpretation is also supported by the analysis of the stars with be data , whose be abundances imply li abundances larger than actually observed ( molaro et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , the upper envelope results from the various lithium enrichment processes occurred during the overall galactic lifetime .",

    "boffin et al .",
    "used a parameterized one - zone explosive nucleosynthesis model and detailed numerical network calculations to demonstrate how the high peak densities prevailing at the base of the hydrogen - burning shell during the nova outburst prevent the build - up of @xmath0li amounts sufficient for ism enrichment .",

    "+ this check was effectively carried out a few years later : hernanz et al.(1996 ) , using a hydrodynamic code able to treat both the accretion and the explosion stages , have obtained large overproduction factors relative to the solar abundance for @xmath0be - and hence @xmath0li .",
    "therefore , although the final masses injected in the ism are small , significant production of @xmath0li by novae seems possible . in their models",

    "this assumption allows one to obtain the enhanced cno or onemg abundances required in order to give rise to a nova outburst and to explain some observations ( see livio , 1994 for a recent review ) . + more recently , jos & hernanz ( 1998 ) computed an enlarged grid of hydrodynamical nova models for both co and onemg wds , spanning a total range of white dwarf masses of 0.81.35 m@xmath28 . in these models",
    "different mixing levels - ranging from 25 to 75% - between the accreted envelope and the underlying wd core were assumed .",
    "these models predict ejected quantities of @xmath0li able to affect the evolutionary history of this nuclide on a galactic scale .",
    "+ at this point , it is worth emphasizing the strong dependence of these results on the chemical composition at the onset of the explosion : the predicted @xmath0li overproduction factors will be correct only if the evolution of @xmath24he during the accretion phase has been followed in the right manner .",

    "@xmath0li production in agb stars is the only li stellar production mechanism supported by observations .",

    "in addition , all their li - strong stars presented c / o @xmath10 1 and bore evidence of strengthened s - process atomic lines .",
    "these facts were interpreted as a signature of the dredge - up and subsequent envelope burning mechanism , occuring in the massive agb stars ( m @xmath1 48 m@xmath28 ) . since every luminous agb star observed showed the lii doublet , it seemed to be very likely that the @xmath0li produced in the outer envelope was not destroyed quickly , but it was surviving in the stellar atmosphere and injected into the ism by stellar winds .",
    "smith & lambert derived a maximum abundance of @xmath0li as large as a(li ) @xmath1 4.0 for the luminous agb stars and indicated them as a major source of @xmath0li in a galaxy . + these observational findings",
    "were confirmed by theoretical calculations in which a time - dependent `` convective diffusion '' algorithm for the hot bottom envelopes of agb stars was coupled with a fully self - consistent evolutionary sequence ( sackmann & boothroyd , 1992 ) .",

    ". according to sackmann & boothroyd , super - rich lithium giants would occur in the mass range m @xmath1 46 m@xmath28 , when the temperature at the base of the convective envelope exceeds 50 @xmath30 10@xmath31   k and the cameron - fowler mechanism works ( in these models , stars with m @xmath8 7 m@xmath28 ignite carbon in the center before they become agb stars and never experience hot bottom burning ) .",
    "+ later , plez et al.(1993 ) enlarged the smith & lambert s sample of giants in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and pointed out that several of these metal - poor giants have atmospheric abundances of @xmath0li too low to provide a significant contribution to galactic enrichment . on the other hand , sackmann & boothroyd had shown that a decrease in the metallicity causes the hot bottom burning to start at smaller masses , resulting in a larger @xmath0li production !",
    "this seems to lead to a discrepancy with plez et al.s observations , but it should be recalled that low metallicity giants lose their envelope mass at a smaller rate than more metal - rich giants , thus allowing li - burning to occur before the planetary nebula ( pn ) ejection and thus preventing significant ism pollution and explaining plez et al.s findings .",
    "+ recent studies ( mazzitelli et al . , 1999 )",
    "confirm that @xmath0li abundances as large as a(li ) @xmath1 4.0 dex at maximum can be found in the atmospheres of massive agb stars .",
    "the @xmath0li production by c - stars ( coming from progenitors in the mass range 25 m@xmath28 ) can be regarded as negligible on a galactic scale , on the ground of the very small number of li - rich c - stars detected with respect to their total number ( see wallerstein & conti , 1969 ; abia et al . , 1993a , 1993b ; but see also beers et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "such a low number of li - rich c - stars can be easily explained if it is assumed that these stars represent a short - lived phase with respect to the overall stellar lifetime on the agb . on the contrary",
    ", one should assume that for stars with progenitor masses in the range 58 m@xmath28 the envelope ejection in the pn stage shortly follows the lithium production in the envelope itself .",
    "we want to recall briefly that lithium production in these stars is thought to be due either to hot bottom burning , occuring during thermal pulses ( tps ) at the base of the common envelope , or to a mechanism such as that described by iben ( 1973 ) , involving only the region of the outer convective envelope lying near the hydrogen burning shell , during the long timescale of the interpulse phases .",
    "@xmath0li synthesis in massive stars ( m @xmath15 10 m@xmath28 ) is theoretically explained as being due to a particular mechanism , the neutrino process .",
    "the first realistic exploration of the so - called neutrino process ( @xmath6-process ) , acting during sneii explosion , was undertaken by woosley et al.(1990 ) .",

    "<S> the evolution of the @xmath0li abundance in the galaxy has been computed by means of the two - infall model of galactic chemical evolution . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , the absolute yields of @xmath0li , as suggested by a recent reevaluation of the contribution of gcr spallation to the @xmath0li abundance , have been adopted .    </S>",
    "<S> we compared our theoretical predictions for the evolution of @xmath0li abundance in the solar neighborhood with a new compilation of data , where we identified the population membership of the stars on a kinematical basis . </S>",
    "<S> a critical analysis of extant observations revealed a possible extension of the li plateau towards higher metallicities ( up to [ fe / h ] @xmath1 @xmath20.5 or even @xmath20.3 ) with a steep rise afterwards .    we conclude that 1 ) the @xmath0li contribution from novae is required in order to reproduce the shape of the growth of a(li ) versus [ fe / h ] , 2 ) the contribution from type ii sne should be lowered by at least a factor of two , and 3 ) the @xmath0li production from gcrs is probably more important than previously estimated , in particular at high metallicities : by taking into account gcr nucleosynthesis we noticeably improved the predictions on the @xmath0li abundance in the presolar nebula and at the present time as inferred from measures in meteorites and ttauri stars , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also predicted a lower limit for the present time @xmath0li abundance expected in the bulge , a prediction which might be tested by future observations .    # </S>",
