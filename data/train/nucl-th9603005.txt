    "nuclear matter produces a restoration of chiral symmetry which is remarkably large . the quark condensate , which is the order parameter of the spontaneous symmetry breaking , decreases in magnitude by about 1/3 at the normal density @xmath1@xcite .",
    "the bulk of this restoration comes from the additive effect of independent nucleons .",
    "an effort has been made to study the restoration effect due to the interaction between the nucleons @xcite .",
    "in particular , chanfray and ericson @xcite made the observation that the quark condensate in a dense medium ( of density @xmath2 ) is governed by the nuclear sigma commutator with the exact relation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the quark condensate density in the medium and @xmath5 its vacuum value .",
    "the pion mass and decay constant are @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( = 94 mev ) .",

    "thus the study of the in - medium quark condensate amounts to that of the sigma commutator . in the low density limit",
    ", @xmath15 reduces to @xmath16 the nucleon sigma commutator and the relation  ( [ lin ] ) leads to the linear density dependence given in refs .  @xcite . notice that since @xmath15 is of order @xmath17 the relative modification of the condensate survives in the chiral limit @xmath18 .    using the partially conserved axial current hypothesis ( pcac ) , chanfray and ericson",
    "have related @xmath15 to the soft pion amplitude on the nucleus .",
    "they have thus shown that a correction to the additive assumption , _ i.e. _ @xmath19 , arises from the contribution of the pions exchanged between the nucleons which also participate in the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "this simple result does not depend on the original assumption that pcac holds @xcite .    pushing the consequences of pcac ,",
    "m. ericson has suggested the existence of a reaction of the nuclear medium against the restoration of chiral symmetry , arising from the distortion of the soft pion wave @xcite .",
    "this possibility was examined by birse and mc govern  @xcite in the linear sigma model where pcac holds .",
    "the distortion effect is indeed present but these authors have shown that it is overcompensated by exchange effects , linked to the @xmath20 meson , such that there is an overall acceleration of the restoration instead of a hindrance .",
    "on the other hand t. ericson has shown that the soft pion amplitude can be appreciably affected by the correlations @xcite , eventually cancelling , as expected , the distortion effect in the limit of nucleons totally confined inside the correlation hole .",
    "the aim of the present work is twofold .",
    "we first want to complete the studies of refs .",
    "@xcite by introducing the correlations in the linear sigma model in a consistent way , which was not done previously .",
    "we will show that the effect of the correlations should not be discussed alone , but in connection with those of the @xmath20 meson exchange introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the information provided by the scattering of physical pions on nuclei",
    "we will discuss the limitations of the linear sigma model and show that it can not be trusted for a quantitative discussion .",
    "the second and main aim of this work is then to perform an exploration of the nuclear sigma commutator in the non - linear sigma model , which does not assume the existence of a scalar meson . in the non - linear version",
    "the pcac relation does not automatically hold .",
    "this hypothesis is abandoned as a systematic assumption and only the chiral properties of the interaction are emphasized .",
    "however for certain representations it is possible to make a transformation on the field in such a way that pcac is valid . in this case",
    "the nuclear sigma commutator coincides with the soft pion amplitude and it is possible to elucidate the interplay between the distortion and the exchange terms .",
    "we will show that physical quantities , such as the condensate and the in - medium pion mass   are independent of the representation , as expected from a general theorem @xcite .",
    "we will also introduce the correlations in a consistent way in this model .",
    "we limit our discussion to the s - wave isospin symmetric pion - nucleon amplitude .",
    "we work in the linear sigma model , where the sigma commutator is proportional to the soft pion amplitude .",
    "we want to evaluate the scattering amplitude for soft pion on a nucleus , taken for simplicity as a piece of nuclear matter of density @xmath2 .",
    "we denote @xmath21 the amplitude per unit volume so that @xmath22 .",

    "however , when the sum of the second order contributions is performed , the two terms in @xmath32 exactly cancel each other .",
    "what this cancellation reveals is that the role of the incoherent rescattering ( graph  [ figb]a ) should not be discussed alone , otherwise chiral symmetry would be violated since the amplitude @xmath21 would not vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "instead incoherent rescattering should be associated with the contribution of the correlations in the @xmath20 meson exchange graphs  [ figb]b - d so as to make the soft amplitude go as @xmath34 .",
    "this cancellation has not been discussed in the previous works of refs .  @xcite but it is necessary to reach a consistent description .    adding the contribution of first order in the density to obtain the total amplitude we arrive at the following expression for the density evolution of the quark condensate : @xmath35      \\left ( 1 - \\frac{m^2_\\pi } { m^2_\\sigma } \\right)\\ > . \\label{consig}\\ ] ]    here we have introduced the sigma commutator of the nucleon , @xmath36 which in the linear sigma model writes : @xmath37 .",
    "notice that @xmath15 could also be obtained directly as the expectation value of the symmetry breaking piece of the lagrangian , i.e. of @xmath38 , in a correlated medium .",
    "the toy model of ericson   @xcite corresponds to the limit of a large correlation hole compared to the extension of the condensate . in the linear sigma model this corresponds to the condition @xmath39 .",
    "one sees on eq .",
    "( [ consig ] ) that the term in @xmath40 then goes to zero and @xmath41 .",

    "the sigma model grossly fails to reproduce the corresponding scattering length .",
    "the measured value is slightly repulsive @xmath49@xcite arising essentially from the pseudovector ( pv ) nucleon pole terms .",
    "the model gives instead a much larger repulsion , @xmath50 .",

    "as already mentioned the value deduced from experiments is much larger @xmath52 fm . with a small extension of the condensate ,",
    "one is closer to the limit where the condensate remains inside the correlation hole .",
    "we have seen that in this limit the incoherent rescattering cancels the coherent one , which is not the case in a realistic situation .",
    "the linear sigma model thus overestimates the incoherent rescattering effect , and more generally overstresses the role of the correlations .    _",
    "iii ) _ the last point concerns the @xmath20 meson exchange effects . is their magnitude realistic  ?",
    "we can confront them with the experimental value of the s - wave optical potential . since the @xmath20 exchange graphs of fig .",
    "[ figa]c - d are sea - gull terms , they are independent of the energy , thus keeping the same value for physical pions .",
    "this implies the existence of a many - body correction due to @xmath20 exchange in the s - wave optical potential .",
    "the latter is commonly parametrized as  @xcite : @xmath53 since the quantity @xmath54 incorporates many - body effects of various sources , it is a function of the density .",
    "the value of @xmath54 deduced from the @xmath0-mesic data is @xmath55  @xcite .",

    ", the linear sigma model predicts an exchange contribution ( eq .",
    "( [ sigex ] ) with the last term in @xmath57 removed ) @xmath58 .",
    "this would mean that most of the observed potential would have this origin .",
    "let us discuss this point in more detail .",
    "in the low density limit the parameter @xmath54 should reduce to the free nucleon value @xmath59 . at finite density , there is one correction of well known origin .",
    "it is the rescattering with charge exchange , linked to the pauli correlations  @xcite . at @xmath60",
    "this adds @xmath61 .",
    "we have also to consider the effect of correlations , @xmath62 linked to the isospin symmetric amplitude , i.e. the incoherent rescattering term previously discussed and contained in eq .",
    "( [ sigres ] ) .",
    "this is not a sea - gull term .",
    "therefore it depends on the energy , but its dependence is mild and we neglect it . removing the term in @xmath63 and the coherent rescattering in eq .",
    "( [ sigres ] ) , we find : @xmath64 a small contribution .",
    "finally we have to consider also the exchange correction due to pion excess .",
    "it represents the s - wave scattering on exchanged pions discussed by chanfray and ericson in the case of soft pions  @xcite .",
    "this is also a sea - gull term which keeps the same value for physical ones . with an excess number of pions per nucleon of 0.1",
    "the corresponding contribution is @xmath65 .",
    "adding all the known contributions @xmath66 we arrive already at @xmath67 , exactly the experimental value . unless there is a large attractive correction ( but we do not see from where ) there is no room for the large @xmath20 meson exchange correction implied by the linear sigma model , which is therefore unrealistic for @xmath0-nuclear scattering problem as well .",
    "thus we can safely conclude that the meson exchange terms in the scattering amplitude of soft , or physical pions , linked to the exchange of a scalar - isoscalar object , can not be as large as given by the linear sigma model .",
    "this was our motivation to investigate the non - linear sigma model .",
    "though non - linear sigma models have an already long story , their systematic application to nuclear forces and pion nuclear interactions has been recently popularized by weinberg  @xcite .",
    "we follow the guideline provided by an effective lagrangian introduced in this spirit by lynn in his study of nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "we start from the linear sigma model with the lagrangian density @xmath68 where the chiral symmetric part writes in standard notations : @xmath69 where the limit @xmath70 is to be taken to get the non - linear version . in order to recover the non - linear model of lynn , we modify the chiral symmetry breaking term by adding a term bilinear in the nucleon field with the same chiral transformation property as the usual term linear in the sigma field : @xmath71 with , as before , @xmath16 = 45 mev the nucleon sigma commutator .",

    "as already mentioned in the introduction , this does not mean that the medium dependence has to disappear in the chiral limit since @xmath84 is finite .",
    "the situation is very similar to that encountered in the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation where the pion decay constant @xmath7 which is non zero in the symmetry limit is related to the vacuum expectation value of the symmetry breaking hamiltonian .",

    "our result for uniform nuclear matter , in the hartree approximation , is expressed as the following integral :    @xmath89    we have introduced the dispersive form in the right hand side of the second equality in order to facilitate the comparison with the feynman - hellmann theorem . the physical interpretation of this term is the same as the one given in ref .",

    "the relevant pieces of the lagrangian in the pcac representation are : @xmath147 in a correlated medium the amplitude can be evaluated from the graphs of fig .  [ figf ] and  [ figg ] . those of fig .  [ figf ] are the contact terms while those of fig .",
    "[ figg ] represent the coherent and incoherent rescattering .",
    "the latter corresponds to the lorentz - lorenz effect well known in the p - wave case . in the absence of correlations and in the static approximation only the first two pieces of the lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ lsoft ] ) contribute an amount ( graphs  [ figf]a and  [ figf]b ) : @xmath148 which is nothing else than the expansion of @xmath149 of formula  ( [ tbsoft ] ) . with correlations",
    "the graph  [ figf]c gives : @xmath150 where the two parts in the integrand arise from the second and third pieces of the lagrangian respectively .",
    "the rescattering terms  [ figg]a and  [ figg]b add : @xmath151 summing all the pieces the total soft pion amplitude thus reduces to : @xmath152 the overall effect of the correlations disappears due to cancellation between the lorentz - lorenz term ( _ i.e. _ the incoherent rescattering of graph  [ figg]b ) and the correlation contribution in the contact terms .",
    "the soft amplitude and hence the sigma commutator are affected neither by distortion nor by correlations .",
    "thus we recover the result of the weinberg type lagrangian .",
    "the validity of our statement about correlations is however limited to the simplest case where the chiral lagrangians ( e.g. our eqs.([lsig]-[lwsb ] ) ) do not contain terms of second order or more in nucleon fields bilinears @xmath153 .",
    "as we will be comment later on , correlations effects can not be excuded on the sole basis of chiral symmetry for lagrangians extended to higher order .",
    "it is natural to extend our study to the case of threshold physical pions , as we did in the linear sigma model .",
    "our aim is first to understand if , in the non - linear model , chiral symmetry imposes the existence of two - body terms in the s - wave optical potential .",
    "this was the case in the linear sigma model .",
    "the second point is to make a quantitative evaluation of the influence of the correlations linked to the isospin symmetric @xmath0n amplitude .",
    "concerning the first point , we recall that in the pcac representation and for soft pions contact terms are needed to cancel the distortion .",
    "the question is then : are these contact terms present in the s - wave optical potential as it is the case in the linear sigma model  ? in the weinberg representation contact terms are totally absent .",
    "their cancellation is therefore plausible in the pcac representation .",
    "the problem is to understand the mechanism for cancellation . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the extra terms in @xmath154 and @xmath155 which do not change the essence of the discussion .    in the pcac representation",
    "the pion self energy has been given in eq .",
    "( [ tborn ] ) .",
    "it displays a priori many - body terms .",
    "threshold pions correspond to the situation where @xmath156 which are valid outside the nucleus . for the inside conditions we take the example of a spherical nucleus with a uniform density . in the interior of the nucleus",
    "the pion keeps its energy and acquires a momentum @xmath157 solution of the dispersion equation : @xmath158 _ { \\omega = m_\\pi } = 0 \\ ; ,   \\label{disp}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath159 such that @xmath160 . in the usual expression of the potential @xmath161",
    "the momentum dependence is not explicitly taken into account but it has to be implicitly incorporated in the parameter @xmath162 as follows : @xmath163 = - { \\rho\\sigma_n } { f_\\pi^2}\\ ; .",
    "\\label{b0eff}\\ ] ] this expression displays no two - body terms and is the same as for the weinberg lagrangian .",
    "thus in the pcac representation of the non - linear sigma model the momentum dependence of the self energy is such that many - body terms are absent in the s - wave optical potential . in the linear model instead , the @xmath0n amplitude @xmath164 which also satisfies the adler condition , depends only on the four momentum transfer variable @xmath165 so that in the forward direction there is no three momentum dependence . hence the self energy is momentum independent and there is no cancellation of the contact terms . in that respect",
    "the non - linear and linear sigma models are quite different .",
    "we now turn to the influence of correlations on the s - wave pion - nucleus optical potential . for this purpose",
    "it is simpler to use the weinberg lagrangian supplemented with the @xmath134 term introduced previously in eq .",
    "( [ deltal ] ) .",
    "indeed in this case there are no two - body contact terms and correlations enter only as a lorentz - lorenz effect . for pions at rest with energy",
    "the amplitude in the born approximation ( _ i.e. _ the pion self - energy ) takes the following form in a correlated medium : @xmath166 \\ > .",
    "\\label{tphys}\\ ] ] here @xmath167 is the full off - shell @xmath0n amplitude including the nucleon poles in pseudovector coupling ( first term on the right hand side of the following equation ) : @xmath168 the s - wave pion optical potential is obtained from the self - energy eq .",
    "( [ tphys ] ) taken at @xmath169 : @xmath170 .",
    "the pole terms can be ignored in the part with the correlation integral which gives a very small contribution . as for the remaining terms the effect of the correlations is totally negligible due to the cancellation which occurs at threshold @xmath171 .",
    "the same conclusion would be obtained in a more complicated way with the pcac representation .",
    "thus we can conclude that only the incoherent rescattering with charge exchange , which has not been introduced in the present discussion , is relevant for the s - wave optical potential , at variance with the findings of salcedo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .    one conclusion of our study with the non - linear sigma model is the absence of two - body terms in the nuclear sigma commutator @xmath15 ( apart from those due to pion exchange ) and in the s - wave optical potential .",
    "the meaning of this statement is that chiral symmetry does not impose them .",
    "they can nevertheless be present .",
    "indeed we have used the simplest forms of the chiral lagrangians . in the nuclear medium , at the same order in the chiral expansion one can add terms quadratic in the nucleon density or higher , either breaking chiral symmetry such as @xmath172 or conserving it as e.g. @xmath173 . in the spirit of chiral perturbation expansions all the coefficients",
    "are phenomenological and should be determined by experiment though their order of magnitude can be guessed by dimensional counting arguments  @xcite . a priori they can be of any sign , accelerating or hindering chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "we are planning to explore which experiments can be informative on these terms , beyond the obvious one of pion - nucleus scattering . in the same way nucleon - nucleon interaction terms built with squared bilinears @xmath174 ( @xmath175 matrices ) should be present as introduced e.g. in refs  @xcite to simulate heavy exchanges . with such lagrangians ,",
    "the effects of correlations can be buried in the coefficients of some contact terms or / and have to be explicitly computed as loop contributions .",
    "to conclude the present study , we have investigated the evolution with density of the quark condensate beyond the approximation of non interacting nucleons . in the non - linear sigma model",
    "we have found that the calculable correction to the linear dependence of the quark condensate arises from the one - pion and two - pion exchange potentials .",
    "the first one has been already discussed by chanfray and ericson  @xcite . as for the latter we have evaluated it in the framework of the non linear model and found it to be small .",
    "however we stress that this is only a part of the two - pion exchange potential , the part linked to the contact s - wave @xmath0-nucleon amplitude .",
    "the bulk of the potential arises from the p - wave coupling terms which is outside the present approach .",
    "the evaluation of its role is in progress .",
    "symmetry does not impose other two - body contributions contrary to what occurs in the linear sigma model .",
    "they can nevertheless be present but have to be determined empirically .",
    "in particular there is no systematic reaction against the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "since the quark condensate is the order parameter of chiral symmetry , it is intimately linked to the physics of the pion which is the goldstone boson of this symmetry in the broken phase .",
    "it is thus natural to apply the concepts developed for the condensate in the nuclear medium to the pion - nucleus interaction .",
    "the absence of two - body terms imposed by chiral symmetry in the condensate reflects in their absence in the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential .",
    "the possible ones have to be determined empirically .",
    "we have also found that correlations act only through the well known incoherent rescattering with charge exchange .",
    "thus the non - linear sigma model has been quite helpful to make clear several intriguing points .",
    "we have displayed on an example how the independence of the condensate and other physical quantities on the particular form of the lagrangian is achieved . in the version where pcac holds",
    ", this property occurs through a subtle cancellation which eliminates both coherent ( distortion ) and incoherent rescattering ( effect of correlations ) in the soft pion amplitude .",
    "we have made a quantitative estimate of the ( small ) contribution of the contact two - pion exchange potential @xmath176 to the condensate , which can be extended to the full two - pion exchange .",
    "though pcac may be misleading in the sense that it introduces artificial effects eventually cancelling each other , the derivation of the condensate properties from a soft pion amplitude has the advantage of stimulating the application of the same methods to the domain of physical pions . following this line",
    "we have been lead to question the use of the linear sigma model for the estimate of heavy meson exchanges .",
    "such cross - fertilization between physics related to qcd and pion physics will likely bring new results in both fields .",
