    "these notes are from two talks given at the newton institute in july 1999 . the goal was to assess the status of cmb anisotropy measurements and give some indication of what the future holds . given the extraordinarily rapid development of this field , this article is sure to be outdated soon after it appears .",
    "the program included a section on interferometers and the data therefrom by anthony lasenby , on the physics of the cmb by george efstathiou , and on data analysis by dick bond so i shall not discuss those matters here .",
    "anthony lasenby also covered work on esa s planck satellite .",
    "my talks are biased toward the experiments i know best .",
    "some of the experiments which i will discuss , in particular the mat experiments ( a.k.a . toco97@xcite and toco98@xcite ) , were done by a collaboration between mark devlin s group at the university of pennsylvania and the princeton group .",
    "it would be stunning if the currently popular model survived to be our favorite model of the universe in a few years .",
    "recent panoramic assessments of cosmological data @xcite @xcite suggest the universe is made of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , & @xmath10 subscript stands for baryons , @xmath11 for cold dark matter , and @xmath12 for a cosmological constant type term . ] . in other words ,",
    "only 5% of the universe is made of something with which we are familiar .",
    "there are three classes of observations that lead to the current picture .",
    "the supernovae data indicate that the universe is accelerating and thus need something like a cosmological constant to explain them .",
    "secondly , the mass density , @xmath13 , as inferred from galactic velocities , cluster abundances , cluster x - ray luminosities , the s - z effect in clusters , the cluster mass to light ratio , etc . is @xmath14 .",
    "thirdly , the cmb data suggest that the universe , within the context of adiabatic cold dark matter models , is spatially flat @xcite @xcite .",
    "the cmb data are improving rapidly .",
    "new data ( toco97 , toco98 ,",
    "cat@xcite ) , since @xcite , @xcite , strongly disfavor the nominal open spatial geometry models , and the case is getting tighter by the month @xcite .",
    "we should point out that the position of the first peak does not _",
    "prove _ the universe is spatially flat ; there is enough wiggle room with the other parameters even within the limited context of adiabatic cdm models @xcite , but a spatially flat model is the simplest explanation when one assumes prior knowledge of other parameters such as @xmath15 .",
    "in 1990 john mather and colleagues @xcite , using the far infrared spectrophotometer ( firas ) aboard the cobe satellite , showed that the cmb is a blackbody emitter over the frequency range of 70 to 630 ghz .",
    "it is perhaps the best characterized blackbody .",
    "a recent analysis @xcite gives the temperature as t@xmath16  k ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "the error , 2 mk , is entirely systematic and so it is difficult to assign a precise confidence limit .",
    "the statistical error is of order 7 @xmath17k .",
    "this measurement was quickly followed by the ubc rocket experiment @xcite which found t@xmath18k ( @xmath19 ) .    at frequencies greater than 90 ghz",
    ", the firas measurement will not be bettered without another satellite . at lower frequencies ,",
    "the measurements are less precise and there is plenty of room for improvement .",
    "the best long wavelength measurement is by staggs et al .",
    "@xcite at 11 ghz .",
    "they find @xmath20k .",
    "deviations from a pure thermal spectrum are expected to show up near a few ghz .",
    "in addition , we know the universe was reionized at @xmath21 , so there should be remnant free - free emission , also at a few ghz . unfortunately , near these frequencies , our galaxy emits about 2 k making a 0.01% determination of the cmb temperature difficult , to say the least .",
    "our picture of the spectrum of the cmb will not be complete until the long wavelength part of the spectrum is known though only a few groups are seriously considering these tough experiments .",
    "figure 1 shows all the anisotropy data that has at least made it into preprint form ( as of this writing , oct .",
    "99 , all of it has been accepted for publication ) .",
    "many of the data points have not been confirmed or are essentially unconfirmable ; others have large calibration errors ; some data sets comprise sets of correlated points ; still others have foreground contamination . despite this ,",
    "the trend is clear . from the sachs - wolfe plateau discovered by come / dmr @xcite",
    "there is a rise to an amplitude of @xmath22k at @xmath23 and a fall after that .",
    "it is worth reviewing what sort of systematic checks we have between different experiments . at both large and small angular scales ,",
    "the spectrum of the anisotropy is seen to be thermal .",
    "also , at the largest angular scales , there is a clear correlation between dmr at 53 ghz and the firs data at 180 ghz @xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "the dust contribution to firs was subtracted though inclusion of it did not significantly alter the results : the dust is not correlated with the cmb . at smaller angular scales , sk at 35 ghz@xcite saw the same signal as did the msam experiment at 200 ghz . in an analysis tour",
    "de force , fixsen et al .",
    "@xcite show that the cobe / firas instrument  remember firas is an absolute measurement  sees the same anisotropy as the cobe / dmr instrument which is a differential microwave radiometer .",
    "a plot of the cross correlation is consistent with a thermal spectrum from 90 to 300 ghz .    outside of the above measurements ,",
    "teams have not confirmed each others findings .",
    "the reason is that it is difficult to match scan strategies from different instruments .",
    "this is one of the reasons that maps are desired .",
    "there are preliminary indications that the sk and qmap maps agree @xcite as do the maps from two seasons of python @xcite .",
    "figure 2 show all the data from figure 1 binned into ten @xmath2-space bins .",
    "the plot is remarkable and gives us faith in the hot big bang model .",
    "the rise of the angular spectrum and the location of the peak for a spatially flat universe were predicted well in advance of the measurements .",
    "it is also satisfying that these data have shown that a number of alternative models simply do not work .",
    "for instance , large classes of isocurvature models do not fit the data ( but by no means is the isocurvature mechanism excluded ) , simple open models do not fit the data @xcite , @xcite , and a broad class of defect models do not fit the data @xcite .",
    "the cmb is a 2-d random field in temperature with variance of order @xmath24 .",
    "if one could measure the anisotropy with sharp filters in @xmath2-space , one would find the _",
    "rms _ variations for @xmath2 between @xmath25 to be @xmath26k , between @xmath27 to be @xmath28k , and between @xmath29 to be @xmath30k .",
    "so far , the data are consistent with a gaussian temperature distribution .",
    "characterizing the anisotropy is challenging because one wishes to measure accurately microkelvin variations from an experiment sitting on , or just above , a 300  k earth .",
    "nature , though , has been kind .",
    "the cmb is the brightest thing in the sky between 0.6 and 600 ghz ; and fluctuations from emission from our galaxy ( for galactic latitudes @xmath31 ) are smaller than the fluctuations intrinsic to the cmb @xcite , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "we do not yet know if we shall be so fortunate with the polarization , but low frequency measurements suggest this may be the case @xcite .",
    "we may get a sense of the scale of the corrections for foreground emission from the sk data .",
    "sk observed near the north celestial pole at @xmath32 .",
    "the contribution to the original data set from foreground emission is 4% at 40 ghz @xcite .",
    "it turns out the contamination was not due to free - free emission , haslam - like synchrotron emission , or extra galactic sources , but rather was due to a component correlated with interstellar dust emission .",
    "the favorite current explanation is that this component is due to radiation by spinning dust grains @xcite .",
    "this component was not expected when the experiment was conceived . in the qmap experiment ,",
    "the contamination at ka ( @xmath33 ghz ) is @xmath34% @xcite ; no significant contribution to the q band data was measured .",
    "@xcite , looking in the southern hemisphere at high galactic latitudes , found effectively no contamination at 40 ghz .",
    "the scientific payoff from the cmb has motivated a large number of experiments ; over twenty groups are trying to measure the anisotropy .",
    "the frequency coverage is large .",
    "the experiments and detector technologies are summarized in @xcite , @xcite , & @xcite .",
    "here we just note that there are three general classes of measurements .",
    "they are ( 1)beam switching or beam synthesis experiments , ( 2)direct mapping experiments , and ( 3)interferometers . by far the most data have come from the beam switching / synthesis method but this is certain to change soon .",
    "the detectors of choice are high electron mobility transistor amplifiers ( hemts @xcite , @xcite ) for frequencies below 100 ghz and bolometers for higher frequencies .",
    "the primary advantage of hemts is their ease of use and speed .",
    "a typical hemt sensitivity is @xmath35 .",
    "the advantage of bolometers is their tremendous sensitivity , e.g. @xmath36 .",
    "the cmb anisotropy has also been detected with sis mixers@xcite .    over the past year , five new results from experiments have come out of which i am aware .",
    "they are the iac@xcite , cat , qmap , toco , and python 5 .",
    "these data span from 30 to 150 ghz and from @xmath37 to 400 .",
    "they support the picture given in @xcite . as an example of a beam switching experiment , i ll use toco ; and as an example of a mapping experiment i ll use qmap .",
    "the qmap experiment is described in a trio of papers ( @xcite , @xcite , & @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of qmap , which was proposed before map , was to make a `` true '' map of the sky at 30 and 40 ghz . by true map",
    "we mean a map that is simply described by a temperature and temperature uncertainty per pixel . ideally , the pixel to pixel covariance matrix is diagonal . for qmap ,",
    "this was not the case and the full covariance matrix was required .",
    "maps that are reconstructed from beam switching measurements , for instance the sk@xcite , msam@xcite , max@xcite , and python 5@xcite maps , are not true maps and can not be analyzed as maps .",
    "qmap is a direct mapping experiment .",
    "the data stream is converted directly into a map and the covariance matrix is computed from the data .",
    "so far , only four experiments have directly mapped the cmb anisotropy ( cobe / firas , cobe / dmr , firs , and qmap ) .",
    "qmap , so far , has the highest s / n per pixel .",
    "we can look forward to the boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite data which , with their tremendous detectors , should produce much higher sensitivity maps .",
    "the key to making a map is to `` connect each pixel with all the ones around it . ''",
    "@xcite @xcite . in simplest terms",
    ", one wants to sit at a pixel and know the derivatives in each direction .",
    "qmap accomplished this connectedness by observing above the north celestial pole and letting the sky rotate through the beam .",
    "the scan lines thus intersect at a variety of angles @xcite .",
    "maps that are reconstructed from temperature differences ( e.g. from beam switching experiments ) do not generally have this property because the differences are all done at constant elevation ( sk is an exception ; again the rotation around the north celestial pole was used . )    the qmap power spectrum is given in table 1 .",
    "with the two flights , and six channels per flight a number of cross checks can be made . the data common to both flights and between channels within one flight are consistent . in a chi - by - eye",
    ", the qmap map looks very similar to the reconstructed sk map in areas where they overlap @xcite .",
    "the qmap data are extremely clean .",
    "there is essentially no editing of spurious points etc .",
    "one simply takes the data , calibrates it , removes a slowly varying offset ( this is done self - consistently in the map solution ) and produces the map .",
    "it is the type of data set for which the analysis pipeline could have been written before the experiment .",
    "the mat / toco experiment is a collaboration between mark devlin s group at penn and the princeton group .",
    "we took the qmap gondola and optics , changed the cooling from liquid helium to a mechanical refrigerator , and mounted the telescope on a nike ajax radar trailer . for two seasons ( oct .- dec .",
    "1997 and jun .- dec .",
    "1998 ) we observed from cerro toco near the alma site in the northern chilean andes .    in the first season",
    "( toco97 ) , all the hemt channels worked but the two sis channels did not .",
    "the problem with the siss was fixed for the second season ( toco98 ) .",
    "thus we cover from @xmath38 to @xmath4 in multiple frequency bands . in the field",
    "we were plagued by refrigerator problems .",
    "this resulted in a higher sis temperature and thus lower sensitivity than we expected from the laboratory measurements .    in this sort of experiment",
    ", one must deal with the variable atmospheric temperature and variable local temperature .",
    "the data must be edited and one must go to great measures to ensure that the editing does not bias the answer . of central importance",
    "is the correct assessment of the instrument noise .",
    "as @xmath39 is proportional to the measured variance minus the instrument variance , an incorrect assessment of the noise will bias the result ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite for discussions ) .    the straight forward way to make sure that the noise is understood is to make combinations of the data in which the sky signal is cancelled out .",
    "the analysis of such a null signal should yield the instrument noise .",
    "these null combinations should cover multiple time scales and spatial scales .",
    "as an example , we show the null tests from the toco97 data in figure 5 ( for toco98 see @xcite ) .",
    "note that in all cases , the signal is well above the instrument noise and that for each l - space bin , the null tests , regardless of time scale , give consistent noise levels .",
    "additionally , the ratio of the noise between @xmath2-space bins can be computed ; it agrees with the data .",
    "the results from both campaigns are in table 1 .",
    "there are roughly 100 more days of 30 and 40 ghz data to analyze .",
    "i ve tried to come up with an easy - to - state criteria for selecting data sets for a compendium of solid results above @xmath37 .",
    "qualifications for entry onto this list would include confirmation of results , maturity of analyses ( of order 30% of the reported data has undergone some sort of reanalysis after publication resulting in significantly different answers ) , some check for foreground contamination , internally consistent data , and measurements that include internal consistency checks of the data quality and noise levels .",
    "i have not been successful .",
    "as any caveated selection runs the hazard of being biased toward results that agree with our results , i will use instead a completely subjective criterion .",
    "namely , experiments with which i have been involved over the past few years .",
    "the list is given in table 1 .",
    "the sqt data span from 30 to 150 ghz , use different calibrators , involve different analysis packages , different radiometers , different platforms , and different observing strategies .    except for the qmap point at @xmath40 which is somewhat correlated with the other qmap points",
    ", these data can be considered uncorrelated . at low @xmath2 ,",
    "all data sets are sample variance limited .",
    "the sky coverage varies quite a bit . for sk",
    "it is 200 deg@xmath41 , for qmap 530 deg@xmath41 , for toco97 600 deg@xmath41 , and for toco98 500 deg@xmath41 .    what is the significance of the down turn from the peak near @xmath5 ?",
    "the first thing to note is that the d - band data points ( toco98 in figure 6 ) are essentially uncorrelated .",
    "there are two data points below the maximum .",
    "the net effect is a @xmath42 detection of a fall from just the toco98 data alone .",
    "in addition , including the last ( low ) sk point enhances the probability of a downturn . in other words , from just these data ,",
    "the down turn is indisputable . and",
    "of course there are many other experiments as shown in figure 1 .    in table 1",
    "we also give the recent analysis of the msam data @xcite .",
    "the msam point at @xmath5 is about @xmath43 below the mean of the sqt points .",
    "interestingly , the data comprising this point come from a section of sky examined in two msam flights @xcite and on the ground in the sk experiment @xcite .",
    "my interpretation is that this is a statistical fluke .",
    "msam covers only of order 10 deg@xmath41 of sky .",
    "the experiments are well enough documented to check this against the map data .",
    ".selected data .",
    "calibrations errors ( @xmath44% ) are not included . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to put these numbers in perspective , the _ rms _ magnitude of the cmb is about @xmath45k . in k band ,",
    "the _ rms _ galaxy signal is roughly the same .",
    "to first order , these add in quadrature to produce a signal with an _ rms _ of @xmath46k . in v - band ,",
    "the galactic contribution is far less ; it will change the power spectrum by @xmath47% if uncorrected .",
    "these rough numbers show that the power spectrum estimates are quite robust to the galactic contamination .",
    "as we have emphasized , the goal of map is to make maps ; the power spectrum is just one way to quantify them . in producing a map of the cmb",
    ", we will clearly have to model and subtract the galaxy . the rightmost column in table 4",
    "gives an indication of the contribution to the map if the sidelobe contribution is not accounted for .",
    "the scan strategy is at the core of map and can only be realized at a place like l2 . to make maps that are equally sensitive to large and small scale structure , large angular separations must be measured with small beams . to guard against variations in the instrument , as many angular scales as possible",
    "should be covered in as short a time as possible .",
    "map spins and precesses like a top .",
    "there are four time scales .",
    "the beams are differenced at 2.5 khz ; the satellite spins at 0.45 rpm ; the spin axis precesses around a @xmath48 half angle cone every hour ; and the sky is fully covered in six months . in one hour , roughly 30% of the sky is mapped .    as of this writing , the core of a pipeline exists to go from the time ordered data to maps to a power spectrum .      of primary interest , initially , will be the angular spectrum .",
    "it will be calibrated to percent accuracy and there will be numerous independent internal consistency checks . of central importance will be the accompanying systematic error budget",
    ". the power spectrum will be sample variance limited up to @xmath49 .",
    "in other words , if the systematic errors and foreground contributions are under control , it will not be possible to determine the angular spectrum any better .",
    "map will be sensitive up to @xmath50 .",
    "the angular spectrum is not the best metric for assessing map .",
    "the primary goal is a map with negligible correlations between pixels .",
    "with such a map , analyses are simplified and the map is indeed a true picture of the sky .",
    "map should be able to measure the temperature - polarization cross correlation @xcite and will be sensitive to the polarization signal itself .",
    "correlations with x - ray maps will shed light on the extended sunyaev zeldovich effect ( not to mention the dozen or so discrete sources@xcite ) .",
    "correlations with the sloan digital sky survey will inform us about large scale structure .",
    "map will be calibrated on the cmb dipole and thus will be able to calibrate radio sources and planets to a universal system .",
    "it will also help elucidate the emission properties of the intergalactic medium .",
    "this is a truly amazing era for cosmology .",
    "our theoretical knowledge has advanced to the point at which definite and testable predictions of cosmological models can be made . for the cmb anisotropy , results from the angular power spectrum , frequency spectrum , statistical distribution , and polarization",
    "must all be consistent .",
    "in addition , these results must be consistent with the distribution , velocity flows , and masses of galaxies and clusters of galaxies as well as the age of the universe .",
    "there is a fantastic interconnecting web of constraints .",
    "using the cmb to probe cosmology is still in its early phase .",
    "after all , the anisotropy was discovered less than a decade ago .",
    "as cosmological models and measurements improve , the cmb and other measures will become a tool for probing high energy physics .",
    "for example , should the cosmological constant survive , we will have a handle on new physics in the early universe that we could never have obtained from accelerators .",
    "i thank chuck bennett , mark devlin , amber miller , suzanne staggs , and ned wright for comments that improved this article . in the course of writing , a paper describing the viper experiment@xcite appeared .",
