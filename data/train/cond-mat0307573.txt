    "since no electrical conductance is detected , the ferromagnetic double exchange @xcite does not appear to operate . at the same time , for the presently accepted values of the parameters , the observed magnitude of @xmath3 is too high to be explained within the superexchange scenario but by adjusting parameters within the physically acceptable range , such a scenario becomes plausible .",
