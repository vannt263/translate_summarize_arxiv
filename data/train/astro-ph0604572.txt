    "a star is considered  massive \" if it can ignite carbon burning in its core during the late stages of its evolution .",
    "such stars are the progenitors of black holes and neutron stars and have masses larger than 10 . since they go further into nucleosynthesis stages than stars like the sun , these stars are the most important sources of chemical enrichment in galaxies . such massive stars , of spectral type o , are blue and bright objects .",
    "their luminosities amount to @xmath0l@xmath1 : such objects are thus visible from far away in the universe .",
    "in addition , their effective temperatures are larger than 30kk , meaning that the majority of their radiation is emitted in the ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "massive stars are therefore the main sources of ionizing radiation in galaxies , and this explains why these stars are surrounded by bright nebulae that are  regions of ionized gas .",
    "+ the distribution of mass amongst stars follows a law of the form @xmath2 with @xmath3 the number of stars in the mass interval @xmath4 $ ] , @xmath5 a constant and @xmath6 the initial mass of stars .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is generally considered to be 2.35 ( the salpeter value ) . consequently , the number of stars decreases when the mass increases .",
    "massive stars are therefore very rare among the stellar population : for each star with a mass between 60 and 120m@xmath1 there form 250 stars with masses between 1 and 2m@xmath1 .",
    "this paucity also means that such stars are also generally distant : the nearest o - type star , @xmath8 oph , is situated between 417 and 509 light years ; whereas the nearest wolf - rayet star ( see below ) belongs to the binary system @xmath9 vel and is somewhere between 740 and 975 light years from the earth .",
    "+ whilst the lowest possible mass of a massive star is generally well known , the question of the maximum mass of these stars is not settled yet , mainly because of the difficulties in measuring the stellar masses . estimating the mass of an object",
    "can be done by modelling its spectrum , but these models are not always reliable , especially when approaching the limits of the parameter space .",
    "the use of a mass - luminosity relation has also been widely popular amongst astronomers but it can result in unrealistic large masses when the object is not spatially resolved .",
    "for example , r136a , at the core of the 30 doradus nebula in the lmc , was once thought to be a single , 1000 - 2500  star .",
    "it was later found that r136a was actually composed of a dozen components ( weigelt et al .",
    "1991 , see also fig .",
    "[ r136 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the only reliable method for deriving masses is to observe eclipsing binaries . using kepler s laws , one",
    "can then constrain all physical parameters of the system by observing the photometric eclipses and the spectroscopic signature of the orbital motion . however",
    ", we may note that only young binaries , where no interactions have taken place , can lead to reliable , typical masses .",
    "the most massive stars detected so far by this method belong to wr20a and have masses of 82 and 83  ( rauw et al . 2005 , see fig .  [ wr20a ] ) .",
    "in addition , another method has been used by figer ( 2005 ) to derive an upper limit on the stellar mass : when observing the arches cluster , he should have detected 20 to 30 stars of mass larger than 150 , but this was not the case ( see fig .",
    "[ arches ] ) .",
    "he therefore concludes that there exists no star with a mass larger than 150 .",
    "we emphasize that this upper limit is much larger than the actual largest mass observed in wr20a .",
    "+    it can also be noted that the very first generation of massive stars ( when there was no metal in the universe , i.e. population iii objects ) , could have reached much larger masses ( hundreds to 1000 ) .",
    "they could have given birth to intermediate - mass black holes , that might have become seeds for the supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies .",
    "these first stars should also have been very luminous and are therefore thought to be responsible for the re - ionisation of the universe approximately one billion years after the big bang .",
    "finally , they would have been the first celestial objects to build metals , sowing the whole universe .",
    "however , all this is still very putative .",
    "+      there exist two ways of classifying o - type stars : the spectral morphology or the determination of line ratios .",
    "the first criterion fits the general philosophy of the mkk classification scheme , where a sample of ` typical ' standard spectra is constructed and serves as comparison when determining spectral classes . for o - type stars ,",
    "the main tool of this kind is the atlas made by walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) , which provides low - resolution spectra in the 4000 - 4700   range ( see fig .",
    "[ walb ] ) . as",
    "o - type stars are very hot , the lines useful for classification are indeed helium lines : the stronger the  lines compared to the  lines , the earlier ( i.e. the hotter ) the star . the transition from o to b - type stars occurs when the 4542 line is extremely weak , barely detectable .",
    "note that a morphological classification is also used to classify evolved massive stars , i.e. wolf - rayet stars . +    .",
    "classification criteria for o - type stars using ew measurements ( van der hucht 1996 ) : @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ; and @xmath12 .",

    "2002 ) are not presented here .",
    "[ spectraltype ] [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another possible analysis of the spectrum of a single star is to investigate its variability .",
    "a very efficient tool for this task is the temporal variance spectrum ( tvs ) that was defined by fullerton et al .",
    "consider a dataset of @xmath3 normalized spectra with the same wavelength sampling and arrange them in a matrix @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the jth wavelength element of the ith spectrum . to search for variability , the spectra have to be compared to a mean spectrum , and the differences tested statistically .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise ratio is different for each spectrum and a weighting is therefore needed in order to perform meaningful statistical tests . to this aim",
    ", we define the weighting factor @xmath15 as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the inverse of the signal - to - noise in the continuum of the ith spectrum , and @xmath18 is equal to @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 is the inverse of the rms signal - to - noise in the continuum of the dataset .",
    "the weighting factor therefore enables to reduce the importance of low quality ( i.e. low signal - to - noise ) spectra .",
    "it is also important to take into account the wavelength - to - wavelength variations of the noise : indeed , the signal - to - noise ratio is higher in emission lines , but the intrinsic variations are also higher and larger deviations are thus normally expected for these lines .",
    "the observed deviations have thus to be `` normalized '' by a correcting factor reflecting the expected noise . if the exposure time is sufficient , the instrumental noise is negligible compared to the photon noise and a good correction factor @xmath21 would be simply @xmath14 , the spectrum itself : @xmath22 is then @xmath23 if there is an absorption line ( since a lower signal implies a lower noise ) and @xmath24 in the case of an emission line above the continuum . taking these correcting factors into account ,",
    "the tvs at a given wavelength is then defined as : + @xmath25 + with the mean spectrum @xmath26 + this tvs follows a distribution @xmath27 ( @xmath28 being here the reduced chi - squared ) , and a statistical test can therefore be performed easily : the deviations are generally considered significant if they exceed the 99% level .",
    "an example of such a tvs is shown in fig .",
    "[ tvs ] . +    once a variability is detected and if the spectra are sufficiently numerous , the dataset can be searched for periodicities in the observed variations .",
    "this can be done for example with the generalized fourier transform ( see heck et al .",
    "1985 and remarks in gosset et al .",
    "2001 ) that extends the fourier transform to the case of non - regular sampling . + for massive stars ,",
    "a stochastic variability is generally expected because of the presence of the unstable stellar wind that generates short - lived small - scale structures .",
    "in fact , the instability of the wind is intimately linked to the line - driven mechanism .",
    "consider an atom or ion at a distance @xmath29 of the star and moving at a velocity @xmath30 .",
    "it absorbs photons at a frequency @xmath31 in its reference frame , i.e. a frequency @xmath32 in the reference frame of the star ( cf .",
    "the velocity can be slightly perturbed and become @xmath33 . if @xmath34 , the atom / ion will absorb photons of higher frequency , of which plenty are available , and it will therefore accelerate even more : the perturbation is thus amplified . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath35 , the atom / ion can only absorb photons of lower frequency but these have already been absorbed by the slower material closer to the star and are no more available : the particle will therefore decelerate even more with respect to the unperturbed @xmath30 velocity law , and the perturbation is again amplified .",
    "hence , any slight perturbation of the velocity is doomed to be amplified , provoking the formation of small - scale structures ( so - called clumps ) in the wind .",
    "these structures are thought to produce a stochastic variability of the spectrum .",
    "+ sometimes , however , variations appear to be regular , with periods ranging from a few hours to several years .",
    "the most common sources of variability include : +    * _ pulsations_. it is well known that the spectra of cepheids change as these stars pulsate radially .",
    "non - radial pulsations of lower intensity can also modify the line profiles and magnitudes of stars .",
    "generally , asteroseismology has focused on low - mass stars , but a few massive objects ( e.g. @xmath8 oph , hd152219 , hd93521 ) apparently also display pulsations . * _ structures in the wind_. structures in the wind on a rather large scale can appear and disappear , modifying the observed spectrum .",
    "for example , if the stellar surface harbors a cold ( resp .",
    "hot ) point , the mass - loss rate above that point will be decreased ( resp . increased ) and",
    "the velocity of the gas will become larger ( resp .",
    "smaller ) because of the reduced ( resp",
    ". increased ) absorption : this modified wind will soon collide with the ",
    "normal \" surrounding gas . due to the stellar rotation , spiral structures might then appear , and give rise e.g. to discrete absorption components ( dacs , see fig .",
    "[ spiral ] and cranmer & owocki 1996 ) . * _ magnetic fields_. because of the very broad lines in the spectra of the massive stars , it is very difficult to estimate their magnetic field and so far there are only two cases , the stars @xmath36oric and hd191612 , where it has been measured with certainty . in the @xmath36oric system , the wind material is funneled by the magnetic field towards the magnetic equator , creating a dense equatorial region where some emission lines can arise .",
    "a recurrent modulation of the spectrum then appears because the magnetic axis is not aligned with the rotation axis ( hence the name _ magnetic oblique rotator _ used for @xmath36oric ) : different parts of the  disk \" are therefore seen at different phases of the rotation cycle ( see fig .",
    "[ thetaori ] and stahl et al .  1996 ) .    in this context , the peculiar variability of the of?p stars needs to be mentioned .",
    "the of?p category was introduced by nolan walborn in 1972 to describe two stars , 108 and 148937 , with spectra that were slightly different from those of normal of supergiants .",
    "notably , they present  lines around 4650  with an intensity comparable to that of the neighbouring  lines . in addition , their spectra show sharp emission lines and some p cygni profiles .",
    "a third star was soon added to this new class , 191612 .",
    "the observation of 108 , the best studied member of this class , led to conflicting results in the past , with explanations for the radial velocity variations ranging from binary motion to stochastic wind instabilities . using a 15yr monitoring campaign of the star , naz et al .",
    "( 2001a ) discovered that the star actually underwent long - term line profile variations : the balmer lines and the  lines passed from emission or p cygni profiles to absorptions while other emission and absorption lines were unchanged , like 4542 .",
    "these variations appear recurrent with a timescale of approximately 50 - 60 years .",
    "a few years later , walborn et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) reported a very similar phenomenon in the spectrum of another of?p star , 191612 ( see fig .",
    "[ 191612 ] ) , but the timescale appears much shorter , about @xmath37540  days .",
    "the same timescale was subsequently detected in hipparcos photometry ( see naz et al . 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "investigations to determine the exact nature of these peculiar stars are still ongoing .",
    "because of technical difficulties , x - ray astronomy was born quite recently . indeed , rockets or satellites are needed to overcome the absorbing effect of our atmosphere - doing x - ray astronomy was thus not possible before world war ii .",
    "in addition , the efficiency of x - ray detectors and telescopes has improved very slowly , and that explains why the first generation of  great observatories \" ( i.e.  and ) was only launched in 1999 .",
    "+    spectroscopy in x - rays can be performed in 3 different ways : +    * _ ccds_. ccds for x - rays can provide much more than a simple image . due to the low luminosities of astronomical objects in the x - ray range ,",
    "the x - ray photons can in fact be recorded one at a time .",
    "the electron shower generated at the arrival of the photon will therefore be recorded precisely in position and also in intensity .",
    "as the number of electrons is directly proportional to the energy of the incident photon , ccds provide a cheap and simple way to do spectroscopy , although only at a rather low - resolution ( @xmath38 ) . * _ gratings_. gratings ( either in transmission or reflection ) can be used in the x - rays with only little modification compared to the visible domain .",
    "such instruments provide a higher resolution than ccds : @xmath39 .",
    "* _ bolometers_. as for ccds , x - rays are detected once at a time in bolometers , where the photon energy is converted into thermal energy of the electrons .",
    "since a higher frequency photon will lead to a larger temperature increase of the bolometer , spectroscopy is a direct by - product of the use of bolometers .",
    "they provide high - resolution spectra ( @xmath40 ) , but they need to be cooled to 0.1k ( because an x - ray photon will provoke a @xmath41 of only a few 0.001k ! ) .",
    "the japanese observatories astro - e and astro - e2 should have used the first bolometers for x - ray astronomy , but the former exploded after launch and the latter lost all its liquid helium ( necessary to cool the bolometer ) shortly after orbit insertion .",
    "an example of spectra obtained with the first and second methods is shown in fig .",
    "[ specx ] . +",
    "as far as massive stars are concerned , x - ray astronomy really began 25 years ago . at that time , the @xmath42 observatory had just been launched and nasa was trying to calibrate it by observing well - known sources .",
    "the observation of one of these sources , cyg x-3 , revealed four nearby spots ( see fig .",
    "[ cygx3 ] ) . at",
    "first thought to be due to an instrumental effect , the spots were soon found to mark the discovery of x - ray emission from 4 massive stars belonging to the cyg ob2 star cluster .",
    "indeed , @xmath42 and its followers showed that x - ray emission is very common among massive stars . +    however , the exact origin of that emission is still under debate .",
    "some authors had first proposed that a corona at the base of the wind , analogous to what exists in low - mass stars , could be responsible for the high - energy emission of massive stars . however , several observational objections against such models were raised ( see owocki & cohen 1999 and references therein ) : absence of a strong attenuation by the stellar wind ( this suggests that the source of the x - ray emission lies significantly above the photosphere , at several stellar radii ) , too low an x - ray output , inconsistencies between uv and x - ray predictions compared to observations , ... as an alternative , a scenario based on the instability of the line - driven mechanism has been proposed .",
    "in fact , an unstable line - driven wind does not flow at the same velocity everywhere and shocks between the different parts are expected , causing the formation of dense shells which will be distributed throughout the whole wind . at first , the forward shocks between a fast wind and the ambient slow ( `` shadowed '' ) material were considered as the probable cause of x - ray emission , but subsequent hydrodynamical simulations rather showed the presence of strong reverse shocks which decelerate the fast , low density material .",
    "however , the resulting x - ray emission from such material after it crossed the reverse shock is very low , and can probably not explain the level of x - ray emission observed amongst o stars . more recent simulations by feldmeier et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that mutual collisions of dense shells of gas compressed in the shocks would lead to substantial x - ray luminosities , comparable to the observed ones . such models also predict significant short - term variations of the x - ray flux but since this is not observed , it was concluded that the winds are most probably fragmented ( or clumpy ) , so that individual x - ray fluctuations are smoothed out over the whole emitting volume , leading to a rather constant x - ray output ( feldmeier et al .",
    "in addition , a supplementary x - ray emission may result from other mechanisms , which are not necessarily present in every massive star .",
    "for example , an accreting compact object will generally emit a wealth of x - rays and can have a drastic impact on the stellar wind structure ( e.g.  kallman & mc cray 1982 ) . in binary systems containing two hot stars , a colliding - wind phenomenon ( see next section ) and/or inverse compton scattering by relativistic electrons accelerated by the shocks ( chen & white 1991 ) will also lead to additional x - ray emission .",
    "finally , the wind from both hemispheres , deviated by a magnetic field , can collide in the equatorial regions , and provide another substantial source of x - ray emission ( babel & montmerle 1997 ) .",
    "+ on the observational side , it was soon found that the x - ray luminosity scales with the bolometric luminosity of massive stars .",
    "although quite dispersed in the past , the data now show the relation to be rather tight : @xmath43 ( sana et al .",
    "2006b ) . on the other hand",
    ", low - resolution spectroscopy has unveiled the fundamental characteristics of the x - ray emission .",
    "first , it is not of the blackbody - type : as the heated gas is optically transparent at these wavelengths , the observed emission corresponds to the superposition of discrete emission lines .",
    "this emission can thus be fitted by optically thin thermal plasma  mekal \" or  raymond - smith \" models . moreover ,",
    "the temperature of the emitting gas is found to be about 0.5kev , or 6mk , and the wind absorption is generally low , except for wolf - rayet stars .",
    "+ the high - resolution spectra enable to go further into the analysis of the x - ray emission .",
    "two main types of studies can be undertaken .",
    "the first one is related to the @xmath44 triplets .",
    "these lines are seen in helium - like ions and correspond to transitions from the @xmath45 level to the @xmath46 ground level .",
    "the @xmath47 line , or forbidden line , arises from the transition 1s 2s ( @xmath48 ) @xmath49 1s@xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) whereas the @xmath29 ( for resonance ) line is linked to the transition 1s 2p ( @xmath52 ) @xmath49 1s@xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and the @xmath53 ( for intercombination ) line to the transition 1s 2p ( @xmath54 ) @xmath49 1s@xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) . in stellar coronae",
    ", the ratio of the @xmath47 and @xmath53 lines mainly depends of the electron density .",
    "however , in the hot plasma surrounding massive stars , the uv radiation plays an important role by coupling the upper levels of these two lines thereby reducing the @xmath47 line in favor of the @xmath53 line .",
    "therefore , the @xmath55 ratio is a diagnosis of the dilution factor @xmath56 of the uv radiation , i.e. a diagnosis of the distance @xmath29 from the stellar surface where the x - rays are emitted ( see fig .  [ fir ] ) .",
    "for example , the x - rays from @xmath8pup and 9sgr apparently form at a few stellar radii , as predicted by the standard model at the specific energy of the line .",
    "this is the case for 9 sgr ( see right part of fig .  [ fir ] ) . ] , whereas the @xmath57 ratio observed for @xmath36oric suggests that the x - ray emission arises very close to the photosphere ( rauw 2005b ) .",
    "note that the @xmath58 ratio is sensitive to the temperature of the gas .",
    "+    in addition , high - resolution spectroscopy also enables to investigate the detailed morphology of the x - ray lines , leading to additional physical information .",
    "if the wind were optically thin without any absorption , the lines would appear flat - topped ( see right part of fig .",
    "[ morph ] ) . however , the wind absorbs part of the x - rays that it has emitted itself .",
    "this absorption will be larger if there is more material between the emission region and the observer , as is the case for x - rays emitted in the receding part of the wind .",
    "the absorption will thus affect more the red part of the line : the observed line will therefore appear blueshifted ( see right part of fig .",
    "[ morph ] ) .",
    "in addition , the wind expands with a large velocity , so that the lines should appear rather broad .",
    "such broad , asymmetric lines are observed for @xmath8 pup and 9 sgr .",
    "however , @xmath8 ori displays broad but symmetric lines ( fig .",
    "[ morph ] , rauw 2005b ) . to explain this difference , oskinova et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have proposed to consider a porous wind consisting of optically - thick clumps : although each clump can absorb efficiently the radiation , the x - rays can still escape freely by passing between them .",
    "therefore , the absorption does not depend on the opacity of the wind ( clumps ) , but on the spatial distribution of the clumps .",
    "if the clumps are tightly packed , the wind is nearly homogeneous and the lines will be skewed . on the other hand , if the clumps are rare and distant , the lines will be symmetric .",
    "finally , @xmath59 ori presents narrow symmetric lines that could be due to a colliding wind phenomenon ( see below ) while the lines of @xmath36oric can be easily explained by the confined wind model ( rauw 2005b ) .",
    "as we have seen before , massive stars blow dense and powerful stellar winds .",
    "if such stars belong to a binary system , a collision between the two winds is unavoidable .",
    "since the winds are supersonic , the shock between them is a strong one and the gas will become very hot and dense after the collision . this phenomenon was predicted a few decades ago , but it was only considered seriously since recent years , when the observational evidence began to accumulate .",
    "some theoretical considerations will first be presented , before reviewing the observational data .",
    "+ the temperature of the gas after the shock can be evaluated by @xmath60 ( with @xmath61 the mean weight of wind particles and @xmath62 the component of the pre - shock wind velocity perpendicular to the shock surface ) . for solar abundances ,",
    "this equation can be written as @xmath63 or @xmath64 , if @xmath65 is the velocity @xmath62 expressed in thousands of . for typical winds ( @xmath66 )",
    ", the temperature can reach 60mk . to understand the physical properties of the post - shock gas",
    ", we can use the ratio between the characteristic timescale of radiative cooling and the time to escape the shock zone ( stevens et al .",
    "1992 ) : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the separation between the considered star and the stagnation point ( the intersection of the contact surface with the axis joining the two stars centers ) , expressed in @xmath69 km and the mass - loss rate @xmath70 should be given in @xmath71yr@xmath72 .",
    "for values of @xmath73 close to or larger than one , the cooling does not have the time to play a role and the shock can be considered as adiabatic : the gas remains at a high temperature . in this case , no optical emission line should form in the collision zone . on the contrary , when @xmath74",
    ", the cooling is very efficient and the shock radiates a lot ( i.e. emission lines over a broad range of wavelength , including the optical domain , will now be generated in the shock zone ) . in this case , the shock zone is compressed and subject to many instabilities ( see fig .",
    "[ simulations ] and stevens et al .",
    "+    the geometry of the collision zone can also be derived rather easily since the contact surface of the two winds corresponds to the equilibrium between the two wind ram pressures ( stevens et al .",

    "the on - axis momentum ratio @xmath93 can be easily physically interpreted .",
    "first , it enables to find the stagnation point .",
    "in fact , in this case , the two angles @xmath94 and @xmath95 are zero and @xmath93 directly gives the ratio of the distances between the stagnation point and the stars . therefore , the stagnation is closer to the star with the weaker wind ( see fig .  [ cwregionbis ] ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath93 also gives the form of the shock because the half opening angle of the shock cone ( in @xmath96 ) was found empirically to be @xmath97 .",

    "[ cwregionbis ] ) .",
    "+ in the above discussion , several effects have been neglected .",
    "for example , in some tight binary systems , there will be a deflection of the shock zone because of the orbital motion . moreover ,",
    "if the system is eccentric , the colliding wind ( cw ) phenomenon could appear only near periastron , i.e. when the stars are closer to each other .",
    "in addition , since the winds are driven by the scattering of uv photons , the wind of one star is affected by the presence of the radiation field of the other star .",
    "this effect is called ` radiative inhibition ' : the radiative pressure from a companion being able to slow the radiation - driven winds , a weaker cw shock will result .",
    "finally , the asymmetry or clumpiness of the winds has also been neglected and only starts to be taken into account in some hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "+      a binary can be easily detected with spectroscopy , except if the system is seen face - on , since the lines regularly shift from the blue to the red side of the spectrum , in harmony with the orbital motion .",
    "if the moving lines of only one star are seen , one talks about an sb1 ( spectroscopic binary with one component detectable ) ; if the lines of both stars are observed , the system is called a sb2 .",
    "normally , all lines detected in the composite spectrum of the system belong to one star or the other but , in the case of a radiative cw , additional emission lines appear .",
    "since these lines are not formed in or close to the photosphere of the stars , they do not follow the orbital motion of the system .",
    "+    doppler tomography can help to better determine the properties of these peculiar emissions but to apply that technique , a good spectroscopic coverage of the orbital cycle is crucial .",
    "two versions of the doppler tomography are available : the simple s - wave analysis and the more sophisticated doppler mapping ( rauw 2005a ) . both request the definition of specific axes @xmath98 : @xmath99 is the binary axis , from the primary to the secondary star ; @xmath100 is perpendicular to @xmath99 , and in the direction of the motion of the primary star ( see fig .  [ tomodef ] ) .",
    "these axes are not fixed but rather rotate with the orbital motion .",
    "if an emission component ( either a discrete one or the position of the peak of a broad emission line ) has fixed velocities in this reference frame , it will appear with a velocity @xmath101 or @xmath102 throughout the orbital cycle ( @xmath103 being the orbital phase ) .",
    "the above combination of a cosine and a sine generates a radial velocity curve that displays an s - shape in the dynamical spectrum , hence the name ` s - wave analysis ' . in practice ,",

    "this map generally also shows the star s position in the velocity space , i.e. @xmath105 for the primary and @xmath106 for the secondary , considering that the system is not eccentric ( the stars never get closer to or farther away from each other ) .",

    "it is defined as @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are two orthogonal reference frames with an angle @xmath110 between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in astronomical spectroscopy ,",
    "@xmath115 is actually @xmath116 , i.e. the intensity of a spectrum at a given velocity and a given phase , which results from the integration of the emissivity function along the line - of - sight through the @xmath104 space . as a consequence",
    ", one does not use the radon transform to get doppler maps , but the _ inverse _ radon transform .",
    "practically , the spectra should first be filtered to suppress the high - frequency noise which would degrade the point spread function of the resulting map .",
    "next , for each observed phase , one must find the intensity in the spectrum at a velocity corresponding to each pair @xmath104 .",
    "finally , the resulting intensities along the orbital cycle are added , using a weighting to take into account the different phase intervals covered by each observation ( rauw 2005a ) .",
    "if the emission corresponds preferentially to a specific region in the @xmath104 space , a peak will appear at that position of the doppler map ; on the contrary , the signal at other velocities appears with random intensities and will therefore cancel out ( see fig .",
    "[ lss3074 ] ) . +",
    "while doppler tomography can be very useful , it must be reminded that the doppler maps display the velocity field .",
    "they are not ` usual ' , spatial maps , and should thus not be interpreted as such : components close in the velocity space can actually be very distant in position .",
    "another example is the doppler map of an accretion disk : the higher velocities are reached closer to the star , therefore , the inner ( resp .",
    "outer ) part of the disk will appear on the outside ( resp .",
    "inside ) in the velocity space !",
    "in addition , the tomography should be applied with care to eclipsing binary systems ( the relative importance of the components would then be biased ) .",
    "the same holds for the systems where emission arises outside the orbital plane ( which is unfortunately the case for winds of massive stars ) .",
    "+    on the other hand , other signatures of the cw phenomenon can also be detected .",
    "for example , in 152248 ( o7.5iii+o7iii ) , sana et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discovered that the strength and width of some emission lines was varying ( see fig .",
    "[ hd152248vis ] ) .",
    "in fact , these emission lines were broader and stronger at quadrature ( i.e. when the stars have maximum radial velocities ) than at conjunction .",
    "this can be easily explained by the presence of a planar cw region just between the two stars .",
    "the emission components produced in this dense cw region would be occulted at conjunction phases : the equivalent width of the lines should be smaller then .",
    "in addition , since the shock is almost perpendicular to the axis of the system , the radial velocities of the particles escaping from the wind interaction region show a broader distribution when our line of sight is aligned with the interaction zone ( i.e. at quadrature ) than at conjunction .",
    "+      in view of the high post - shock temperature , x - ray emission appears as an obvious signature of cw phenomena .",
    "such signatures have indeed been found in many binaries , and they are generally characterized by : +    * _ large x - ray luminosity_. as cw represent an additional phenomena , the x - ray luminosity of binary systems with cw should exceed the simple combination of the two individual x - ray luminosities of the massive stars .",
    "therefore , when comparing x - ray luminosities to bolometric luminosities , cw systems appear above the ` classical ' @xmath117 relation ( see fig .",
    "[ lxlbol ] ) . * _ high temperature_. the x - ray emission from massive stars generally displays a rather low temperature @xmath118 ( about 0.5kev ) .",
    "however , the emission from cw arises in hotter plasma and should therefore present higher @xmath118 .",
    "non - thermal emission coming from inverse compton scattering ( see below ) could also be observed in colliding wind binaries ( cwb ) . * _ modulation of the x - ray flux_. as the binary system rotates , different regions come into view / the line - of - sight .",
    "a modulation of the x - ray flux is therefore expected due to changing absorption of the cw emission . in eccentric systems ,",
    "the variation of the separation @xmath119 between the stars induce variations in the emitted x - ray flux ( @xmath120 , see stevens et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "for example , in the eccentric binary system 93403 ( o5.5i+o7v ) , modulations of the x - ray flux are observed in different energy ranges ( see fig .",
    "[ hd93403 ] and rauw et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the soft x - ray emission most likely arises in the outer regions of the individual stellar winds and the variability in this energy range is probably associated with opacity effects . in the medium energy band ,",
    "these effects are much smaller and the observed variation is consistent with a @xmath121 modulation , where @xmath119 is again the separation between the stars .",
    "+    the short - period binary 152248 also presents modulations of the x - ray flux that could be reproduced to first order by hydrodynamical modelling ( see fig .  [ hd152248 ] and sana et al .",
    "+ like these two systems , the binary @xmath9 vel ( wc8+o7.5iii ) displays phase - locked variations of its x - ray flux .",
    "however , these variations are simply due to a changing opacity : when the shock cone around the o - star is in the line - of - sight , the absorption is much smaller than at other phases when the dense wind of the wolf - rayet star absorbs most of the x - ray flux ( willis et al .",
    "+ finally , the eclipsing binary cpd-41@xmath967742 ( o9v+b1 - 1.5v ) also presents a modulation of the x - ray flux ( see fig .",
    "[ cpd7742 ] and sana et al .",
    "however , this is a peculiar case of cw since the secondary star has a very weak wind .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the wind of the primary directly crashes onto the photosphere of the secondary or that it suffers radiative braking , leading to a wind - wind interaction very close to the photosphere .",
    "since the interaction region is close to the secondary star , its x - ray emission does not reach us when the secondary star is in front ( only the back of the star is then observed ) or when the primary occults its companion ( sana et al . 2005 ) .",
    "+      colliding winds also have an impact on the spectrum at other wavelengths .",
    "when binaries composed of certain wolf - rayet stars are observed in the infrared ( ir ) , for example , the formation of dust in the cw region can be detected . in eccentric systems , this dust formation is recurrent , since it appears only at specific orbital phases , and it leads to a modulation of the infrared emission ( e.g. wr140 , williams et al .",
    "another example is wr104 ( wc9+lateo - earlyb ) , a cw binary ( cwb ) surrounded by an ir pinwheel nebula ( see fig .  [ cwbir ] ) that rotates in harmony with the orbital period .",
    "+ massive stars generally emit radio waves because of thermal free - free transitions in their winds .",
    "such an emission is of the form @xmath122 .",
    "for some binaries , however , an additional , non - thermal emission can be observed .",
    "this radio emission is of the synchrotron type and is linked to the motion of relativistic electrons in the stellar magnetic field .",
    "the acceleration of electrons to relativistic velocities is probably achieved through the first order fermi mechanism .",
    "consider a shock in a wind moving with a velocity @xmath123 .",
    "a high energy particle crossing the shock hardly notices it .",
    "but the downstream gas leaves the shock with a lower velocity ( @xmath124 ) then the velocity at which the upstream gas enters the shock ( @xmath123 ) , and the particle gains on average @xmath125 by simply crossing the shock downwards .",
    "the same particle can then be scattered back upstream by turbulence without any energy loss .",
    "a succession of such crossings can thus accelerate the particle to relativistic energies .",
    "however , the existence of the pre - existing high energy particles , although necessary , is not yet explained theoretically . on the other hand , it has been proven recently that only shocks between two winds are strong enough to accelerate the particles .",
    "this implies that all massive non - thermal emitters are binaries , and this was also proven recently by careful multiwavelength observations ( see de becker , 2005 ) .",
    "note that the radio emission arises in the outer regions of the wind , contrary to what is seen in x - rays , because the inner parts of the winds are opaque to radio waves .",
    "the radio emission from cw regions has even been imaged in some cases ( see fig .",
    "[ cwbradio ] ) .",
    "+ finally , the relativistic electrons can also give rise to non - thermal x- and @xmath126-rays , in addition to synchrotron radio radiation .",
    "in this case , inverse compton scattering forces the relativistic electrons to give up part of their energy to ambient photons ( e.g. the numerous stellar uv photons ) .",
    "these uv photons thus become high - energy radiation .",
    "in addition , relativistic protons can produce neutral pions when they interact with the ions in the densest regions of the wind : these pions subsequently decay into @xmath126-rays .",
    "however , this type of emission has not yet been detected with certainty . +   + the author acknowledges the support of the scientific cooperation program 2005 - 2006 between italy and the belgian ` communaut franaise ' ( project 05.02 ) , of the prodex xmm and integral projectsand the contracts p5/36 `` ple dattraction interuniversitaire '' ( belgian federal science policy office ) ."
