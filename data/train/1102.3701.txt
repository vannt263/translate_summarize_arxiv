    "also , they play a major role in the disk - halo interaction , influencing superbubble break - out and funneling particles out to intergalactic space . finally , the determination of the morphology of halo magnetic fields can shed light on the validity of various dynamo models to explain the origin and evolution of galactic magnetism",
    ".    we will first give a brief summary of the conditions in the haloes of the milky way and nearby spirals in section  [ s : gas ] and  [ s : cosmicray ] .",
    "sections  [ s : bfield ] to  [ s : externals ] describe magnetic field strengths , scale heights , and structure in the milky way and external spiral galaxies .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : interaction ] we briefly discuss the interaction of magnetic fields with other interstellar medium components .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the halo of the milky way consists of the three - phase medium as in the disk , but with varying filling factors and scale heights .",
    "while there is a warm neutral hydrogen layer and cold neutral hydrogen clouds at large distances from the galactic plane @xcite , coupled to magnetic fields through charge exchange , the most direct influence on magnetic field structure comes from the halo plasma .",
    "estimates for the scale height of the warm ionized medium ( wim ) in the milky way vary between @xmath01000 and @xmath01800  pc @xcite .",
    "the volume filling factor of the wim is believed to increase from @xmath1 at the galactic mid - plane to @xmath2 at @xmath31000  pc @xcite . whereas h  ii regions dominate the wim distribution in the galactic plane , at high latitudes h@xmath4 emission from the wim",
    "is more diffuse and pervasive @xcite .",
    "hot , @xmath5  k gas existing inside supernova remnants and superbubbles is predicted to have a filling factor of about @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this estimate is confirmed by the filling factor of large neutral hydrogen holes @xcite and observations of o  vi uv absorption lines @xcite .",
    "a patchy distribution of hot gas at high latitudes is seen in fluctuations in the projected o  vi column densities @xcite and from x - ray shadows of interstellar clouds .",
    "estimates of the hot gas scale height , from absorption lines of high - ionization ions like o  vi and n  v , range from about 3 to 5  kpc @xcite .",
    "rossa & dettmar ( 2003a , b ) reported a mean vertical extent of 1 - 2  kpc of the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) in external spiral galaxies , if they possess warm dust as indicated by the fir @xmath7/@xmath8 ratio .",
    "this shows that gaseous haloes are connected to the star formation activity in the underlying disk .",
    "external galaxies also possess hot x - ray emitting gas with a scale height in the range 4 - 8  kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this gas is again correlated with the presence of warm dust , as for the extraplanar dig .",
    "[ [ the - galaxy-1 ] ] the galaxy : + + + + + + + + + + +    from estimates of the gamma - ray radiation from the compton gamma - ray observatory in the @xmath9  mev band , and isolating the inverse compton component , @xcite concluded that the cosmic ray scale height is probably much larger than that of the gas . an alternative method to estimate the vertical scale height of cosmic rays",
    "is based on counts of cosmic ray nuclei such as li , be , and b , created in collisions of primary cosmic ray nuclei with interstellar hydrogen . using this method , @xcite derived a cosmic ray scale height @xmath10  kpc at the solar radius , consistent with values found by @xcite .",
    "the cosmic ray equivalent scale height derived from observed synchrotron emissivities in the galaxy is about 2  kpc , in agreement with the estimates above @xcite .",
    "modeling of the galactic synchrotron distribution from an all - sky survey at 408  mhz @xcite shows that the synchrotron emissivity in the milky way consists of a thick and a thin disk @xcite .",
    "the scale heights of these components are @xmath0150  pc and @xmath01500  pc , respectively ( after rescaling to a galactocentric radius of 8.5  kpc ) , and 90% of the total power is emitted in the thick disk .",
    "the equipartition value for the cosmic ray scale height derived from this again roughly agrees with the above estimates .    [",
    "[ external - galaxies-1 ] ] external galaxies : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    similarly , in external galaxies vertical profiles of the synchrotron emission can be characterized by two components , a thin disk with a scale height of 300pc and a thick disk with a scale height of 1.8kpc ( at 4.8  ghz ) .",
    "these numbers are remarkably independent of the star - formation rate @xcite .",
    "if we assume equipartition , the scale height of the electrons would thus be 3.6  kpc .",
    "not much is known if the cosmic - ray nuclei and the electrons are transported together but this is generally assumed .",
    "therefore , for electrons with an energy of a few gev , the scale height in external galaxies agrees roughly with the ones quoted above for the galaxy .",
    "the luminosity of x - ray emission in the center of the milky way can only be explained if the galaxy possesses a wind that is hybridly driven by cosmic rays and the thermal gas @xcite . due to the interaction with the ions and electron in the so - called streaming instability",
    "the cosmic rays can push out the ionized gas by momentum transfer , and  if there are sufficient ion - neutrals collisions  also the neutral gas . in a study of the resolved emission in ngc253",
    "it was shown that the scale height of the electrons is proportional to their lifetime leading to an estimate of 300  @xmath11 as the cosmic - ray bulk speed .",
    "this is similar to the escape velocity in this galaxy and rather constant across the full extent of the disk , so that a `` disk wind '' was proposed @xcite .",
    "[ [ the - galaxy-2 ] ] the galaxy : + + + + + + + + + + +    from hydrostatic equilibrium considerations , @xcite determined that cosmic rays , magnetic fields , and a significant fraction of the ism should have scale heights in excess of 1  kpc . in particular , the magnetic field strength only decreases by @xmath12 out to a distance of a kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "a measure for the scale height of the galactic magnetic field can also be found from the synchrotron scale height .",
    "@xcite modeled synchrotron emissivity from measurements of @xcite , which indicates a magnetic field scale height at the location of the sun of about 4.5  kpc @xcite .",
    "this scale height agrees with estimates considering hydrostatic equilibrium in the halo @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy with the smaller scale height of the regular magnetic field component found from faraday rotation measurements was explained by @xcite by stating that the galactic magnetic field becomes less regular away from the plane .",
    "alternatively , these measurements may be explained by two separate magnetic field components with different scale heights @xcite , consistent with observations of a two - layer structure of the galactic non - thermal synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "[ [ external - galaxies-2 ] ] external galaxies : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the scale heights in external galaxies can be estimated from the synchrotron scale height .",
    "if we assume equipartition , we obtain that the magnetic field scale height is a factor of 4 larger than the synchrotron scale height and thus about 6  kpc .",
    "[ [ the - galaxy-3 ] ] the galaxy : + + + + + + + + + + +    much is still unknown about the magnetic field strength and structure in the milky way at large distances from the galactic plane .",
    "@xcite modeled the magnetic field in the galactic halo as a plane parallel field superimposed on a turbulent component , based on synchrotron emissivity and faraday rotation data .",
    "they found that the halo field is unrealistically high with a 1  kpc scale height , but when using a scale height of 1.8  kpc , their estimate of the regular magnetic field strength in the galactic halo goes down to reasonable values of 2  @xmath13 g .",
    "[ [ external - galaxies-3 ] ] external galaxies : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    using the energy equipartition condition the total magnetic field strength in galaxies is @xmath14 @xcite . from the linear polarization one can derive the regular magnetic field strength as typically @xmath15 in the disk @xcite . in the halo , the magnetic field is dominated by the regular component as opposed to the disk .",
    "the regular component in the halo is of the order of the disk component , if we neglect stronger fields that are found in the interarm regions in the disk such as in ngc6946 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* beck , this volume ) .",
    "galactic magnetic fields are maintained and amplified by dynamo action ( see brandenburg et al , this volume ) .",
    "the simplest model is that of the @xmath16 dynamo , which amplifies the radial magnetic field component through differential rotation , and amplifies the azimuthal and poloidal components of the field by turbulent loops twisted by the coriolis force .",
    "although the @xmath16 dynamo is believed to act in the sun @xcite , it is considered unable to sufficiently amplify galactic magnetic fields to observed values ( eddy diffusion time scales are much shorter than time scales for amplification of the regular field , thereby suppressing turbulent motions , and quenching the dynamo ) . various solutions to this problem are discussed in @xcite . for a flat disk - like galaxy which is differentially rotating , mean - field dynamo theory predicts a quadrupolar magnetic field configuration , where the direction of the azimuthal magnetic field is the same above and below the plane , but the direction of the vertical magnetic field component reverses with respect to the plane .",
    "however , for a spherical , weakly rotating structure  such as a galactic halo  the dipolar configuration is more easily excited , i.e.  an azimuthal magnetic field with reversing direction across the galactic plane , while the vertical field is directed in the same way above and below the plane ( see figure  [ f : symm ] ) .",
    "@xmath17{pgms_fig07c.ps } & \\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth]{pgms_fig08c.ps } & \\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth]{pgms_fig09c.ps } \\end{array}$ ]",
    "these two configurations can be observationally distinguished by the directions of the azimuthal magnetic field component above and below the galactic plane , and by the directions of the vertical field components above and below the plane .",
    "firstly , measurements of faraday rotation of extragalactic sources show a pronounced anti - symmetric `` butterfly pattern '' with respect to the galactic plane and the meridian through the galactic center @xcite , only visible in the inner galaxy ( first and fourth galactic quadrants ) .",
    "this has been interpreted as a reversal of the direction of the azimuthal magnetic field with respect to the galactic plane indicative of a dipolar magnetic field configuration and an a0 dynamo @xcite , but can possibly also be due to the influence of local structures on large angular scales @xcite .",
    "secondly , a vertical component of the galactic magnetic field is predicted by @xcite to provide a magnetic tension term that can balance other pressure components in the galactic disk and halo ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite tried to measure this vertical magnetic field component at high latitudes . at the solar radius",
    ", they found a small vertical magnetic field component of @xmath18 g towards negative galactic latitudes but not towards positive latitudes , indicating smaller - scale structure in the halo magnetic field .",
    "these conclusions agree with the structure in the x - ray halo @xcite and with star light polarization measurements .",
    "@xcite include the north polar spur region in their determination of vertical magnetic field strengths and do find a small vertical magnetic field component @xmath19 g , while their estimates towards the southern sky agree with @xcite .",
    "@xcite also find a small , varying vertical magnetic field component at intermediate positive latitudes in the outer galaxy .",
    "@xcite conclude from radio polarimetric measurements at high galactic latitudes that there must be significant variations in the vertical component of the galactic magnetic field on the level of @xmath20 g , similar to the strength of the random magnetic field component at high galactic latitudes @xcite .",
    "however , the studies by @xcite and @xcite were performed at low frequencies , which indicates that they may be probing mostly nearby structure .",
    "the higher - frequency parkes galactic meridian survey at 2.3  ghz detects polarized emission from a larger path length and shows that even towards the southern galactic pole , there is still small - scale structure in radio polarization , indicating structure in the density - weighted galactic magnetic field on scales of degrees ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "[ f : pgms ] ) .    small - scale structure in the high latitude magnetic field",
    "is confirmed by measurements of linear polarization of starlight .",
    "starlight which propagates through asymmetric dust grains aligned in a magnetic field will become partially polarized with a polarization angle in the average direction of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight in the dusty regions between the star and the observer .",
    "berdyugin and co - workers published a series of papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on polarization directions of stars at high latitude , which probe mostly the direction of the field component parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "they concluded ( 1 ) that this magnetic field towards the southern galactic pole is oriented towards @xmath21 , in agreement with a spiral magnetic field , and ( 2 ) that smaller - scale structure towards the northern galactic pole precluded any conclusions about the ordered field component there .",
    "as the polarization percentages keep increasing towards higher distances from the plane , out to their furthest stars at about 500  pc , they concluded that galactic magnetic fields reach at least to 500  pc without significant decrease .",
    "the magnetic field is mainly aligned parallel to the disk in regions close to the mid plane . in the halo ,",
    "the vertical component becomes stronger with increasing height above the disk .",
    "also the magnetic field is more ordered as indicated by the higher polarization degree in the halo .",
    "galaxies that have a radio halo possess also vertical fields . several disk galaxies",
    "viewed edge - on show x - shaped magnetic fields in their haloes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n891 ] for the case of ngc891 .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field aligns with the x in the four quadrants and the polarized emission is enhanced there .",
    "some galaxies have distinctive sites with significant vertical magnetic field components that are referred to as `` radio spurs '' .",
    "they correlate in position with filamentary h@xmath4 emission sticking out from the disk into the halo .",
    "examples for this are ngc4666 @xcite and ngc5775 @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : n4666 ] and [ fig : n5775 ] .",
    "the reason for this structure is not yet clear .",
    "it could be related to the flow of gas in the halo that has x - shaped structure as well @xcite .",
    "the energy densities of the magnetic field and the gas are comparable , so that interaction between the two is possible .",
    "@xcite showed that ngc253 also has an x - shaped field .",
    "this is in so far remarkable as the halo field can only be revealed after subtraction of a model field for the disk , because this galaxy has an inclination angle of @xmath22 and is therefore not exactly edge - on . in the case of ngc253 , @xcite suggested that the halo magnetic field may be enhanced by compression due to expanding hot gas in the halo that is visible as a conical outflow in x - ray emission ( see fig.[fig : n253_pol_xmm2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , radio spurs should align with the boundary of the outflow cone and the magnetic field be roughly tangential to it .",
    "an example of non - x - shaped fields is ngc4631 with a rather more dipolar field structure , where the vertical component of the magnetic field dominates as shown in fig.[fig : n4631 ] .",
    "this may be a case where the field is dominated by an interaction with a nearby companion or where differential rotation is weak and thus the a0 dynamo mode is excited @xcite .",
    "deviations from the x - shaped field structure are also found for galaxies which do not have star formation driven outflows .",
    "ngc4258 @xcite and ngc4569 @xcite are examples for jet magnetic fields . there the magnetic field",
    "is vertically aligned to the disk and parallel to the outflow in the jet .",
    "vertical magnetic fields are also indirectly detected .",
    "m82 has vertical filaments and gaps in the radio continuum emission at @xmath2320 cm with a width of 100pc @xcite .",
    "vertical fields were detected with radio continuum polarimetry in this galaxy albeit at a lower resolution , which likely prevented the detection of filaments @xcite .",
    "@xcite tried to connect the filaments to chimney structures , i.e.  blow outs by clustered supernovae , but the outflow visible in co line emission was only related to a weaker minimum in the continuum emission .",
    "@xcite found vertical `` tentacles '' of a flat spectral index component protruding from the disk into the halo in ngc5775 .",
    "if they are interpreted as outflows of young cosmic - ray electrons , there needs to be some vertical alignments for which magnetic fields are the favored mechanism .",
    "there are other indicators of vertical fields like vertical dust filaments in ngc253 @xcite .",
    "these filaments are thin ( @xmath24 ) compared to the resolution of the available radio maps and are thus far not detected in the continuum or polarized emission .",
    "nuclear outflows are a good site to study filaments in the radio continuum , because they are very bright and allow us to use high resolution .",
    "although they are not located in the halo , they are at the base of the conical outflows discussed above",
    ". they may be also a source for vertical fields .",
    "an example for nuclear outflow is ngc3079 which has a prominent bowl - shaped structure visible as h@xmath4 filaments .",
    "the polarized emission is concentrated in filaments bordering the outflow cone and is tangential to it @xcite .",
    "similarly , the outflow cone in ngc253 is bordered by continuum filaments with a scale height of @xmath25 with the field orientation parallel to the filaments @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field may collimate the nuclear outflows and thus explain the small opening angles @xmath26 of the cones . whereas interaction in the interstellar medium can explain the distribution of the fields in filaments",
    ", it does not _ generate _ vertical magnetic fields .",
    "for this the galactic dynamo is a favorite process .",
    "vertical magnetic fields may also be generated by the parker instability where cosmic - ray gas inflates magnetic field lines that reconnect and give rise to the fast parker dynamo @xcite .",
    "these magnetic fields would be expected to be anisotropic with frequent field reversals .",
    "this configuration is expected to have reversals in the line - of - sight component which can be detected in faraday rotation .",
    "the halo rotation measures ( rms ) are difficult to measure , because they can overlap with the rms in the disk which dominate the polarized emission .",
    "recent papers have tried to separate the contributions from the disk and halo by using models of the magnetic field structure .",
    "@xcite found in ngc253 a magnetic field that points outward on the near side of the halo , but the data is not conclusive for the halo behind the bright polarized emission in the disk .",
    "the field direction has some consequence for the dynamo models because in the presence of a galactic wind the parity of the disk and halo field are expected to be identical @xcite .",
    "@xcite explained the asymmetry of the polarized emission with respect to the receding and approaching side of the galaxy with halo fields . in their sample of 21 galaxies detected in polarization",
    "@xcite they found directions that resemble both the quadrupolar type of fields and dipolar radially directed fields .",
    "the magnetic field structure in the halo is also of interest for angular momentum transport .",
    "if the field lines are stiff and we do not measure any azimuthal component then we know that we are below the alfvnic point .",
    "the higher up the alfvnic point the more angular momentum is transported from the disk into the halo @xcite .",
    "the parker fast dynamo would see rm reversals as part of parker loops .",
    "such a reversal was observed in the nuclear outflow in ngc3079 @xcite . in ngc1569 the vertical magnetic field borders an outflow bubble and",
    "is also accompanied with a field reversal @xcite . in principle",
    "it is possible to distinguish between the anisotropic and the isotropic component of the halo field by comparing the field strengths from the rm and equipartition .",
    "this was attempted by @xcite where they found the field component from the rm to be only 50% lower than that from equipartition .",
    "this would mean that the halo field has only a small anisotropic component generated by parker loops .",
    "interstellar magnetic fields are in constant interaction with the other components in the interstellar medium . magnetic fields",
    "are mostly directly frozen into the ionized gas component , but also closely interact with the neutral gas through charge exchange ( for an example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on large scales ,",
    "the magnetic field energy density is comparable to the cosmic ray energy density and the turbulent gas energy density ( see heiles & haverkorn this volume ; and beck , this volume ) .",
    "this means that any of these components can only be fully understood if the interaction with the other components is taken into account .",
    "therefore , gas dynamics is greatly influenced by magnetic fields .",
    "numerical simulations show that expansion of supernova remnants in a magnetized medium will be anisotropic @xcite and slower @xcite than in the non - magnetized case .",
    "magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence can be a significant source of heating in the ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as can magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields play a large role in the hydrostatic equilibrium of the milky way .",
    "thick gas disks , as observed in the milky way , with purely azimuthal magnetic fields , have a tendency to become unstable ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite show that magnetic tension in a small vertical component of the magnetic field may stabilize this configuration and so help to keep the thick gas layer from collapsing onto the disk .",
    "cosmic rays are tightly coupled to galactic magnetic fields .",
    "these charged particles gyrate around magnetic field lines with a larmor radius depending on their energy and the magnetic field strength .",
    "therefore , magnetic fields effectively trap all except the most energetic cosmic rays in galaxies and fully determine their trajectories .",
    "also , magnetic fields are a major factor in acceleration of these charged particles to their relativistic velocities . for more details , see aharonian et al .",
