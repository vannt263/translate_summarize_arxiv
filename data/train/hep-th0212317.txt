    "the interpretation of current observations in terms of an accelerating universe requires an exotic form of energy density with @xmath5 .",
    "a wide variety of scalar field models have been conjectured for this purpose including quintessence @xcite , k - essence@xcite , tachyonic scalar fields@xcite with the last one being originally motivated by string theoretical ideas @xcite .",
    "( for a recent review of issues related to the cosmological constant and dark energy , see @xcite ) .",
    "since all these models have a free , undetermined function @xmath6 , it is possible to incorporate any reasonable @xmath7 in any of these models @xcite .",
    "thus , at a fundamental level , all these models can be objected to  quite correctly  as lacking in predictive power .",
    "the appropriate way of judging these models , therefore , will be based on the physical input that is used in constructing the model and the generic features which arise in the model .",
    "we investigate here a model in which the coupling of the scalar field to the matter is based on a physical principle which can be motivated as follows : the most obvious generalization of the newtonian gravity , based on @xmath8 will be @xmath9 in which the trace @xmath10 of the energy momentum of fields act as a source for a scalar field . this theory , however , has to be nonlinear , since the scalar field itself has a nonzero trace for the energy momentum tensor which should appear on the right hand side .",
    "further , since cosmological constant has a nonzero trace for stress tensor , this scalar field will also couple to the cosmological constant and the effective cosmological constant will become dynamical . such a model was developed and investigated more than a decade back @xcite , as a possible solution to cosmological constant problem .",
    "this work , however , was ambitious in the sense that it attempted to tackle the problem _ without any fine tuning _ and did not succeed @xcite .",
    "the current thinking in cosmology is remarkably tolerant to fine tuning of parameters and virtually every scalar field model suggested in the literature has either explicit or implicit fine tuning of parameters . in view of this",
    ", one can resurrect the above model , in which the form of the interaction arises from a clear physical requirement , and explore its consequences for cosmology .",
    "we attempt to do this in this paper and show the the resulting models have very nice properties .",
    "the lagrangian for a system made of the gravitational field , matter sources and the scalar field which couples to the trace of the total energy momentum tensor is derived in @xcite .",
    "( this derivation is briefly summarized in appendix a for completeness . ) the complete action , which takes into account the trace coupling of the scalar field , has the form ( see appendix a ) : @xmath12 where the coupling to the trace is given by an arbitrary function @xmath13 and @xmath14 the @xmath15 is the remaining source term ( radiation , matter ... ) , with appropriate coupling to @xmath16 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for the field @xmath16 which arises from the action ( [ action ] ) is given by @xmath17 \\label{tikeqn}\\ ] ] we shall assume that scalar field is evolving in an isotropic and homogeneous space time and that @xmath16 is a function of time alone . the energy density @xmath18 and pressure @xmath19 obtained from @xmath20 are @xmath21 the coupling to @xmath11 modifies the field energy density @xmath18 , pressure @xmath19 and the equation of state parameter @xmath22 .    in a universe containing dust like matter and radiation , the action ( [ action ] ) leads to following evolution equations for the field : @xmath23 ( the radiation , being traceless , does not couple to @xmath16 . ) the friedman equation with the modified energy momentum tensor given by ( [ tikeqn ] ) is @xmath24 \\label{friedeqn}\\ ] ] where background energy density due to radiation and matter is given by    @xmath25    the simplest form of coupling which we shall adopt is the linear one @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the reduced planck s mass and @xmath28 is a coupling constant . since equations ( [ evoleqn ] ) and ( [ friedeqn ] ) reduces to the standard form for @xmath29 , this parameter gives the strength of the forcing term .",
    "equation ( [ evoleqn ] ) describes the evolution of the scalar field in the expanding universe under the influence of an external `` force '' , which depends upon the field and its kinetic energy @xmath30 .",
    "the influence of this term on the dynamics of the scalar field is accumulative .    in the absence of matter",
    ", the conservation equation formally equivalent to ( [ evoleqn ] ) , has the usual form @xmath31 and the evolution of energy density is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 where the ratio of effective kinetic to potential energy@xmath34 is given by @xmath35 interaction modifies the kinetic as well as the potential energy through @xmath36 and @xmath37 , however , @xmath38 bears the same relation to their ratio as in the case of standard scalar field cosmology .",
    "equation ( [ conseqn ] ) , of course , is not valid in presence of matter ;",
    "neverthless numerical work shows that the ratio @xmath39 is still a good parameter which influences the dynamics .",
    "the evolution of potential to kinetic energy ratio plays a significant role in the growth or decay of the energy density @xmath40 at a given epoch and will be crucial in the following discussion .",
    "let us next address the question of choice of potential of the scalar field which would lead to a viable cosmological model .",
    "the obvious restriction on the evolution is that , starting from planck s time , the scalar field should survive till today ( to account for the observed late time accelerated expansion ) without interfering with the nucleosynthesis of the standard model .",
    "exponential potentials lead to solutions which are the attractors of evolution equations when @xmath29 and provide backdrop for the understanding of dynamics in our case .",
    "a standard model with @xmath41 \\label{exppot}\\ ] ] ( and @xmath29 ) is well studied in literature and can be divided into two categories : ( a ) the exponential potentials for which @xmath18 scales slower than the background density @xmath42 which translates to @xmath43 .",
    "( b ) potentials for which scalar field energy density scales faster than the @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 . in the first case",
    "if the background energy density was sub - dominant , it would become more sub - dominant and radiation domination will never occur . in the second case there exists a scaling solution which mimics the background energy density that is dominant , with @xmath46    the discussion of this model with @xmath47 ( so that the coupling to the trace of the stress tensor is switched on ) is given in appendix b. it turns out that this model is not as attractive as another variant of the potential with @xmath48 which we shall concentrate on next .",
    "we shall now consider a model with @xmath49 in which the field evolves towards the origin rather than away from the origin . in order to investigate the dynamics described by ( [ evoleqn ] ) and ( [ friedeqn ] )",

    "the initial conditions will be set at planck time with @xmath57 .",
    "( the scale factor today would nearly be @xmath58 . )",
    "further , for the background energy density , @xmath59 , we make the choice , @xmath60 based on the point of view that , at the radiation dominated phase near the planck s epoch , the energy density of radiation was of the order of planck energy as it was the only scale available at that time . the initial values for @xmath16 and @xmath61 as well as the the parameters in the potential",
    "are chosen so as to ensure a viable cosmological model .",
    "we take the initial values @xmath62 ; @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "the value of @xmath66 is chosen so that initially , @xmath67 , of these choices , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are important for obtaining a viable model ; @xmath70 is arbitrary except for the condition @xmath71 .",
    "the choices made for @xmath72 and @xmath73 are merely done for the sake of convenience ; different choices will lead to same qualitative behaviour .",
    "some of these choices could be construed as fine tuning in the model .",
    "but it is no worse than the fine tuning in any other scalar field model .",
    "the model described by ( [ pottw+ ] ) supports an eternal inflation in absence of the coupling to the trace @xmath1 . the forcing term induced by the back reaction in the field evolution equation acts against the hubble damping and hastens the evolution of field energy density @xmath18 .",
    "we have plotted the ratio of kinetic to potential energy of the field in figure [ figkp+ ] .",
    "it is seen that due to coupling to the trace @xmath1 , the kinetic energy acquires a large value making the potential term unimportant and pushing the field into kinetic regime . as a result",
    ", the field energy density crosses the background energy density and continues evolving as @xmath74 for quite some time ( see figure [ figden1 ] ) . after the crossover",
    ", the dominant contribution to the friedman equation ( [ friedeqn ] ) comes from the background energy density @xmath44 .",
    "this in turn leads to the increase in damping and consequently slowing down of the decay of @xmath40 allowing the ratio @xmath75 to grow .",
    "the energy density gets locked to a constant value in this process and acts like cosmological constant thereby making @xmath76 to grow .",
    "the forcing term containing @xmath77 in the field evolution equation is ineffective in this regime .",
    "a remarkable thing happens when the field starts rolling again at the end of locking regime . as discussed above",
    ", the ratio of kinetic to potential energy of the field ( @xmath78 ) provides a yardstick to determine the energy scaling . at the end of locking period , the field again starts rolling down the hill .",
    "though back reaction again builds up , the kinetic to potential energy ratio is now much smaller than it was in the beginning when @xmath18 was dominant .",
    "the ratio first increases , then fluctuates near its background value , finally heading towards zero ( figure [ figkp1 + ] ) . as a result",
    ", @xmath18 first ( nearly ) tracks the @xmath44 , gradually approaches it and ultimately overtakes it .",
    "this allows the scalar field to dominate and gives rise to accelerated expansion at late times . by suitably tuning the parameters of the model , it is possible to get @xmath2 today ( figure [ figomega ] ) . in figure",
    "[ figoustat ] , we have displayed the equation of state parameter @xmath79 to demonstrate the convergence of different initial conditions to the inflationary attractor .",
    "figure ( [ figeqstat ] ) shows that the @xmath79 mimics de - sitter like behavior shortly after the current epoch .",
    "the role of @xmath77 term on the right - hand - side of evolution equation ( [ evoleqn ] ) is very important in the beginning .",
    "the size of the undershoot crucially depends upon the coupling constant @xmath80 .",
    "larger value of @xmath80 leads to deeper undershoot because the ratio @xmath78 is sensitive to coupling initially .",
    "after the locking period this ratio of the order of few as background ( radiation ) dominates over the field this time . during evolution ,",
    "the scalar field moves from larger values towards the origin . as a result",
    "the influence of the back reaction in the friedman equation ( [ friedeqn ] ) decreases and the field energy density gradually moves towards the background , overtakes it and joins with the ( non - coupled ) inflationary attractor(this may be contrasted with the behaviour in the model described by ( [ exppot ] ) , in which the scalar field evolves from origin to larger values . in this case",
    "the contribution of field energy density in the friedman equation gets gradually suppressed allowing the background to dominate for ever . in this model @xmath18",
    "tracks the background and never comes to dominate it(see figures , [ figone],[figkp1 ] and [ figtwo ] ) .",
    "this development is displayed in figure ( [ figdeng1g2 ] ) which clearly shows : ( i ) deeper undershoot for larger coupling and ( ii ) joining of the inflationary track earlier for smaller value of @xmath80 .",
    "figure [ figdeng1g2 ] also shows that the field continues to stay in the usual ( non - coupled ) attractor phase for quite some time till the potential terms induced by the coupling in field evolution equation become important .",
    "this happens at very late times and the influence of these terms will be discussed below . as for the matter term , numerical analysis shows that they do not influence the dynamics significantly .",
    "thus coupling plays an important role in the intermediate regime(which also maifests in figures [ figden1],[figoustat ] and [ figeqstat ] ) thereby allowing to produce current observed accelerated expansion with necessary tuning of @xmath28 along with @xmath81 .",
    "let us briefly summarize the role of the coupling to the trace @xmath1 .the exponential potential under consideration is shallow and supports an eternal inflation in the standard scenario .",
    "the introduction of the coupling to the trace @xmath1 hastens the decay of @xmath40 , pushing the scalar field into kinetic regime .",
    "after the locking period , its role gradually diminishes making it possible for the scalar field , at late times , to join back the inflationary track it was detracted from . at this stage , the scalar field is approaching the origin and we would expect the equation of state @xmath79 to settle in its attractor value .",
    "however , the equation of state becomes equal to @xmath82 and stays there  which is evident from figure [ figeqstat ] .",
    "the same effect is reflected in the behavior of @xmath18 shown in figure [ figdeng1g2 ] , where the field energy density becomes constant after staying in its attractor value for some time .",
    "this seems to be a general feature of the model under consideration and requires explanation .",
    "the coupling to the trace @xmath1 modifies the field evolution through three extra terms on the right hand side of ( 16 ) .",
    "the first term contains @xmath77 and plays important at the early epochs and during tracking as discussed above .",
    "the second term contains the potential which contributes in the potential dominated regimes : during the turn around of @xmath40 and when the field is rolling slowly .",
    "we will show that this term is responsible for the cosmological constant like behavior of the scalar field at very late times , i.e. , @xmath83 . in order to see this ,",
    "we will cast ( [ eqneight ] ) in the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the effective potential given by @xmath86\\tilde{v}(y_1 ) } dy_1    \\label{veffpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 .",
    "( the matter term is sub - dominant in this limit and is hence ignored . ) in the model described by ( [ pottw+ ] ) , the scalar field is evolving from large values towards the origin and can take negative values .",
    "but when @xmath88 the system will become singular because of the divergence of the first term in ( [ seventeen ] )",
    ". however , the second term in the expression of @xmath89 does not let it happen .",
    "in fact , this term sets an infinite potential barrier at @xmath90 and does not allow the field to reach the singularity .",
    "the potential which was attractive away from the origin becomes now repulsive followed by the infinite barrier on its left ( see figure [ figeffpot ] ) .",
    "this happens when @xmath91 at this stage , the field @xmath16 is rolling slowly .",
    "it crosses the critical point and moves towards the barrier but due to insufficient kinetic energy gets reflected back by the barrier . after making few such oscillations",
    ", the field settles at the critical point permanently and mimics the cosmological constant . for the model described by ( [ pottw+ ] ) with @xmath92 and @xmath93 ,",
    "@xmath94 which is confirmed by numerical integration ( see , figure [ figft ] ) .",
    "in the model described above , like in any generic model of quintessence , universe will be accelerating forever leading to future event horizon  which could pose a problem in the string theoretical context .",
    "it is , however , possible to tackle this problem by using any potential which is exponential for large @xmath16 and is a power law near the origin : that is , we require @xmath95 for large @xmath16 and @xmath96 for @xmath97",
    ". the power law behaviour near the origin will lead to oscillations when the field approaches @xmath98 . the mean equation of state of the scalar field is then given by @xcite @xmath99 as a result the scalar field energy density and scale factor have the following behavior @xmath100 the scalar field behaves like pressure less dust for @xmath101 . by suitably adjusting the parameters in the model",
    "one could ensure that the oscillations occur in the future , i.e. , well after the present epoch when @xmath76 has reached value equal to 0.7 .",
    "one can avoid the future event horizon in such a model , irrespective of the explicit form of @xmath6 which is used , as long as it interpolates between an exponential and power law behaviour .",
    "one of the many possible choices of interpolation is a potential of the form @xmath102 , for which we have evolved the field equations numerically .",
    "the results for a particular choice of parameters are shown in figures ( [ figomegainf ] ) and ( [ figdeninf ] ) .",
    "we summarize below the chronology of main events in any such model with a shallow potential which behaves like a power law near the origin : ( i ) the scalar field starts rolling slowly in the shallow potential .",
    "the coupling to the trace @xmath1 almost instantaneously kills any inflationary behavior and makes the scalar field to enter into the kinetic regime .",
    "the scalar field continues to stay in the kinetic regime ( with @xmath103 ) and soon @xmath40 drops below the @xmath104 .",
    "( ii ) once this happens , the dominant contribution to the friedmann equation comes from the background .",
    "this , in turn , allows @xmath18 to turn towards @xmath104 leading to a locking regime during which the value of @xmath18 stabilizes and remains relatively unchanged for a considerable length of time and the scalar field behaves like cosmological constant .",
    "( iii ) the field starts rolling down the potential again and the back reaction builds up such that the kinetic energy of the field exceeds its potential energy by a factor of few in the beginning .",
    "however , as the field rolls towards smaller and smaller values , the role of back reaction gradually diminishes and the potential energy starts catching up again with the kinetic energy . as a result @xmath18 slowly approaches the back ground energy density and",
    "finally overtakes it .",
    "the scalar field is now back on the original inflationary track .",
    "this phase is interpreted as the late time accelerated expansion of the universe , leading to present day value of @xmath2 .",
    "( iv ) after the current epoch , the universe continues in the phase of cosmic acceleration for quite some time till the scalar field approaches @xmath105 and starts oscillating about it giving rise to @xmath106 and turning the scalar field to behave like cold dark matter ( see figure [ figdeninf ] ) .",
    "this is expected to happen in future and the model is free from the event horizon problem at late times .",
    "( there are other possible solutions to this problem ; see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we have examined the dynamics of a scalar field which couples to the trace of all the field including itself in frw background .",
    "the coupling to the trace @xmath1 of the field modifies the energy momentum tensor and induces a forcing term in the field evolution equation .",
    "the forcing term acts against the hubble damping changing the evolution of field energy density significantly . in case of a steep potential",
    ", it amounts to increasing the steepness of the potential . in case of the shallow potentials in which the field rolls slowly and mimics cosmological constant , the coupling to the trace @xmath1 plays an important role .",
    "it forces the scalar field into kinetic regime allowing the radiation domination to commence .",
    "we have discussed a model in which the effect of the back reaction gradually diminishes allowing the scalar field to catch up with the inflationary attractor regime at late times , thereby accounting for the observed cosmic acceleration with @xmath2 .",
    "we have also presented a variant of the model in which the scalar field plays the role of quintessence at the current epoch and mimics dust like dark matter in future which eliminates the future event horizon .",
    "the general features of the model are shown to be independent of the initial conditions",
    ". however , fine tuning of some of the parameters is necessary to achieve viable evolution .",
    "we summarize here the derivation of the self - consistent lagrangian for a scalar field coupled to the trace of the energy momentum tensor of all matter , originally given in @xcite , for the sake of completeness .",
    "consider a system consisting of the gravitational field @xmath107 , radiation fields , and a scalar field @xmath16 which couples to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of all fields , including its own .",
    "the _ zeroth order _",
    "action for this system is given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 @xmath110 here , we have explicitly included the cosmological constant term and @xmath111 is a dimensionless number which ` switches on ' the interaction .",
    "in the zeroth order action , @xmath1 represents the trace of all fields other than @xmath16 .",
    "since the radiation field is traceless , the only zeroth - order contribution to @xmath1 comes from the @xmath112 term , so that we have @xmath113 .",
    "the coupling to the trace is through a function @xmath114 of the scalar field , and one can consider various possibilities for this function .",
    "the constant @xmath115 converts @xmath16 to a dimensionless variable , and is introduced for dimensional convenience .",
    "since the stress - tensor of the scalar field has a non - zero trace , we must add to @xmath1 the contribution @xmath116 of the scalar field .",
    "if we now add @xmath117 to @xmath1 in the interaction term @xmath118 further modifies @xmath119 .",
    "this again changes @xmath117 .",
    "thus to arrive at the correct action an infinite iteration will have to be performed and the complete action can be obtained by summing up all the terms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the full action can be found , more simply , by a consistency argument .    since the effect of the iteration is to modify the expression for @xmath120 and @xmath121 , we consider the following ansatz for the full action : @xmath122 here @xmath123 and @xmath37 are functions of @xmath16 to be determined by the consistency requirement that they represent the result of the iteration of the interaction term .",
    "( since radiation makes no contribution to @xmath1 , we expect @xmath124 to remain unchanged . )",

    "<S> we study the cosmological evolution of a scalar field that couples to the trace @xmath0 of energy momentum tensor of all the fields ( including itself ) . in the case of a shallow exponential potential , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of coupling to the trace @xmath1 in the field equation makes the energy density of the scalar field decrease faster thereby hastening the commencement of radiation domination . </S>",
    "<S> this effect gradually diminishes at later epochs allowing the scalar field to dominate the energy density again . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this phase as the current epoch of cosmic acceleration with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a variant of this model can lead to accelerated expansion at the present epoch followed by a @xmath3 behaviour as @xmath4 , making the model free from future event horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the main features of the model are independent of initial conditions . however , fine tuning of parameters is necessary for viable evolution .    </S>"
