    "the most promising anticipated source for the united states laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) @xcite , or its french / italian counterpart virgo @xcite , is the radiation emitted during the final moments of inspiral before the coalescence of a neutron star - neutron star ( ns - ns ) binary system @xcite .",
    "the instruments operating in both the ligo and virgo facilities will evolve over time , eventually becoming sensitive to neutron star binary inspirals at distances approaching 2  gpc  @xcite .",
    "binary inspiral observations in the ligo or virgo detectors will be characterized by their signal strength and `` chirp mass '' ( a combination of the binary s component masses and cosmological redshift ) .",
    "the distribution of observed inspirals with signal strength and chirp mass depends on cosmological parameters that describe our universe ( hubble constant , deceleration parameter , density parameter ) , the distribution of neutron star masses in binary systems , the overall density of coalescing binaries , and the properties of the detector . in this paper",
    "i explore the binary inspiral event distribution ( with signal strength and chirp mass ) in the ligo and virgo detectors for different cosmological models .",
    "in addition to their value as quantitative expectations of what ligo and virgo can expect to observe , these _ a priori _ distributions will play a pivotal role both in the construction of templates for detecting binary inspirals and in the interpretation of the observations .",
    "the distributions presented here , evaluated for our preconceived notion of the binary inspiral rate and cosmological parameters , are the _ prior probabilities _ required to form the likelihood function from the observed detector output @xcite .",
    "additionally , the observed inspirals will be a sample drawn from a particular cosmological model characterized by @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , neutron star mass distribution , and evolution characteristic of our own universe . by comparing the observed distributions to the ones described here",
    "we can measure those properties of our own universe    these cosmological tests are analogous to the number - count tests of classical cosmology , which , in their simplest form , involve observing the distribution of a source population as a function of apparent luminosity or redshift .",
    "the first suggestion that binary inspiral number counts be used to measure interesting cosmological parameters was made by finn and chernoff @xcite ( although they did not use the language usually associated with this technique of classical astronomy ) . using monte carlo simulations they demonstrated that the distribution of inspiral events with signal strength and chirp mass could be used to measure the hubble constant . in this work",
    "i provide a more general , explicit , and complete exposition of the properties of binary inspiral observation catalogs .",
    "the cosmological implications of gravitational wave observations of binary inspiral were first recognized by schutz @xcite .",
    "he pointed out that each inspiraling binary is a standard candle in the sense that , if observed in three independent interferometers , its luminosity distance can be determined from the observed detector response .",
    "if an observed inspiral is associated with one of the several galaxy clusters that reside in its positional error box ( whose determination also requires three interferometers ) , and if the redshifts of those clusters are determined optically , then observation of several inspiraling binaries would lead to a statistical determination of the hubble constant that is independent of the cosmic distance ladder and the uncertainties that lurk therein .",
    "markovi @xcite proposed a variation on the general theme introduced by schutz : he observed that known neutron star masses were all close to @xmath13 and that , in any event , there is a _ maximum _",
    "neutron star mass .",
    "the observed chirp mass is a function of the mass of the binary s two components and its redshift . assuming that the mass distribution in neutron star binaries does not evolve significantly over the range of binary inspiral observations , examination of the chirp mass distribution in binary systems at fixed luminosity distance",
    "would reveal the corresponding redshift .",
    "thus , gravitational radiation observations alone might suffice to determine the hubble constant .",
    "unfortunately , detailed calculations show that , even for the most advanced ligo and virgo detectors that have been discussed , the fractional uncertainty in the measured luminosity distance will be of order unity for events seen more frequently than thrice per year ( _ i.e. , _ for events at distances greater than approximately @xmath14 ) @xcite , and the angular position error boxes for these events are likewise large ( on order @xmath15 @xcite ) . consequently ,",
    "cosmological tests that rely on accurate and precise measurements of the distance and position of inspiraling binaries using ligo and virgo are not promising .",
    "in contrast , the cosmological tests discussed here and in @xcite require only gravitational wave observation in a single interferometer . furthermore",
    ", advanced ligo detectors can expect to observe approximately 50 ns - ns binary inspiral events per year , from distances up to @xmath4 , whose signal strength can be measured to better than 10% and whose chirp mass can be measured to better than @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the rate , depth , accuracy and precision of these single interferometer observations suggest that cosmological tests based on the distribution of observed events with signal strength and chirp mass have great promise .      in this paper",
    "i calculate the expected properties of a catalog of binary inspiral observations made by a single interferometric gravitational wave detector .",
    "a catalog is presumed to contain a record of all binaries that coalesced during the observation period and whose inspiral signal - to - noise ratio @xmath0 was greater than the catalog limit @xmath2 .",
    "the catalog properties depend on the coalescence rate density and the binary system component mass distribution , both of which may vary with redshift .",
    "notation for these and a discussion of the observations that bear on them is the topic of section [ sec : dn / dtdmdv ] .    in section [ sec : snr ]",
    "i discuss the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath0 as a measure of signal strength .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of a particular inspiraling binary depends on the binary s intrinsic properties , its distance from and orientation with respect to the detector , and the detector s intrinsic properties .",
    "the way in which @xmath0 depends on the signal and detector properties suggests a useful measure of the detector bandwidth , which i discuss here as well .",
    "finally , section [ sec : snr ] concludes by specializing the discussion to the specific properties of the proposed ligo and virgo gravitational radiation detectors .",
    "the important properties of a binary inspiral observation catalog are the distribution of cataloged events with @xmath0 and the binary system `` chirp mass '' @xmath1 .",
    "these distributions depend on the cosmological model , which includes the evolution with redshift of the neutron star mass distribution and the coalescing binary number density . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "i give general expression for these distributions and discuss how they may be used together with actual observations to test cosmological models .",
    "also in this section i give expressions for the _ catalog depth _ ( the maximum redshift of a binary system that can have @xmath0 greater than @xmath2 ) and the total rate that proposed interferometers can expect to observe inspiraling binaries with @xmath0 greater than @xmath2 .",
    "all of these general expressions are evaluated explicitly for relevant matter - dominated friedmann - robertson - walker cosmological models and a simple model of the neutron star mass distribution .",
    "finally , i summarize my conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath0 of a binary inspiral in a ligo - like interferometer depends on the relationship between the binary and the detector ( _ i.e. , _ orientation , distance and redshift ) and also on certain intrinsic properties of the system ( _ i.e. , _ component masses and spins ) . of these intrinsic properties , the _ intrinsic chirp mass , _",
    "@xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the binary s reduced and total mass , plays the most important role : all the other intrinsic properties offer only small corrections to @xmath0 .",
    "gravitational - wave detectors like ligo or virgo do not measure @xmath20 ; instead , they measure @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the system s redshift with respect to the detector . to distinguish between @xmath1 , which involves the system s redshift , and @xmath23 , which depends only on the binary s intrinsic properties , i refer to the former as the _ observed _ chirp mass , or simply the chirp mass , and the latter as the _ intrinsic _ chirp mass .    in order to describe the binaries included in a signal - to - noise limited catalog",
    "we must first describe the coalescing binary distribution in space and in @xmath23 .",
    "the notation i use to describe this distribution is defined in section [ sec : caln ] , while in section [ sec : nconstraints ] i discuss what is known about the distribution from present - day observations .",
    "assume that coalescing binaries are distributed homogeneously and isotropically with the cosmological fluid and define the binary coalescence _ local specific rate density _",

    "additionally , for infinitesimal @xmath38 , @xmath39 can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen binary on the surface at redshift @xmath22 has intrinsic chirp mass in the range @xmath23 to @xmath40 .",
    "cosmological tests that depend on the observed _ distribution _ of inspirals with @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 do not depend on @xmath41 .",
    "nevertheless , it is necessary to know @xmath41 in order to estimate how long it will take to accumulate a catalog of observations large enough that such tests will give meaningful results .    the best current estimate of the ns - ns binary coalescence rate density at the current epoch is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the hubble constant measured in units of @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this estimates relies on the 3 observed binary pulsar systems that will coalesce in less than a hubble time ( psrs  1913 + 16 , 1534 + 12 , and 2127 + 11c @xcite ) .",
    "since the number of observed systems is small the actual rate is quite uncertain : phinney @xcite has estimated that , while unlikely , a rate two orders of magnitude higher or lower could be reconciled with current observations .    black hole - black hole ( bh - bh ) and bh - ns binaries are believed to form at rates comparable to ns - ns binaries ; however , the masses of these systems and the fraction that merge in less than a hubble time are entirely uncertain @xcite .",

    "theoretical studies suggest that the initial mass of neutron stars formed by stellar core collapse do not vary significantly with the progenitor mass or composition @xcite .",
    "after formation the mass may evolve owing to accretion from a companion ; however , in any event it is not likely that either @xmath37 or @xmath31 vary with @xmath22 more rapidly than do galaxies . in section [ sec : discussion ] i provide general expressions for and detailed examples of the expected distribution of events in a catalog of binary inspiral events ; for the detailed examples i neglect evolution in @xmath46 and @xmath62 entirely . as shown in section [ sec : depth ] , advanced ligo and virgo detectors will observe ns - ns binaries from redshifts not expected to exceed @xmath63 and with the preponderance of events arising from @xmath64 ; consequently , neglect of evolution is not an unreasonable approximation .",

    "estimators are summaries of the distribution @xmath72 and their utility depends on how accurately they are able to represent it . when @xmath72 is very sharply peaked ( _ i.e. , _ there is little uncertainty in the measurement ) then it may be approximated by a @xmath73-function and summarized accurately by the maximum likelihood estimator . when @xmath72 is sharply peaked but with a not insignificant width , then it may be approximated near its peak by a gaussian and accurately represented by the maximum likelihood estimators and their covariance .",

    "figure [ fig : p(m|ml , mh ) ] shows the spectrum @xmath179 for four different matter - dominated einstein - desitter cosmological models corresponding to two different @xmath43 ( @xmath7 and @xmath293 ) and two different neutron star mass distributions : one set of curves corresponds to the assumption that @xmath219 for all binary systems , while in the second set the binary component masses are assumed to be uniformly distributed between @xmath300 and @xmath301 . for all models shown @xmath236 and @xmath221 .    as @xmath53 and @xmath277 approach @xmath283 , @xmath299 approaches @xmath302 .",

    "these distribution have two immediate , practical uses in gravitational - wave data analysis for interferometric detectors : first , when evaluated for with the cosmological parameters reflecting our current best understanding of the universe , they are the prior probabilities which , together with the matched - filtered detector output , form the likelihood function and determine the posterior probability that an inspiral has been detected ; second , when compared with the observed distribution in @xmath0 and @xmath1 of many separate binary inspiral observations , they are used to infer new and more informed estimates for the cosmological parameters that describe the universe .    the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath0 of a binary inspiral event is a detector - dependent measure of the signal strength from a radiation source that is estimated in the course of making an observation .",

    "the sensitivity of the test depends on how the expected catalog distributions change with changing cosmological models .    for advanced ligo detectors , the most distant neutron star binary inspiral events with signal - to - noise ratio greater than @xmath235 will arise from distances not exceeding approximately @xmath4 , corresponding to a redshift of @xmath5 ( 0.26 ) for @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the depth is only weakly dependent on the range of neutron star masses or the deceleration parameter .",
