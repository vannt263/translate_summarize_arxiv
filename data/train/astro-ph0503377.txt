    "it was noted almost 40 years ago that galaxies appear to define a relatively narrow region of the luminosity - surface brightness plane @xcite .",
    "later on , @xcite postulated that this , rather than being the result of a real physical correlation , was due to a selection effect , where large diffuse objects , would be lost due to the brightness of the night sky , while small compact galaxies would be mistaken for stars and not included in redshift surveys .",
    "the existence of this correlation , or otherwise , has important implications for galaxy formation models @xcite .    a small number of large , luminous low surface brightness galaxies have been discovered @xcite , but it is commonly held that such systems are actually rare @xcite .",
    "there are also examples of very compact dwarf galaxies ( e.g. pox 186  kunth et al .",
    "1988 ) but , since these objects are easily confused with stars in typical imaging conditions , large ` blind ' redshift surveys are needed to ascertain their presence , and , as stars outnumber galaxies at the typical apparent magnitudes accessible to survey spectrographs , this is uneconomical in terms of the telescope time needed .",
    "@xcite , however , showed that in the cluster environment the density of galaxies may be high enough , over a small field of view , that a redshift survey of all objects in the cluster area may be feasible , with acceptable rates of stellar contamination , in order to search for compact objects @xcite .",
    "this effort was rewarded by the discovery of the first five representatives of a ` new ' population of galaxies , the ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds ) , in the fornax cluster .",
    "these have stellar appearance in the dupont plates used by @xcite in the fornax cluster catalog ( fcc ) , but nevertheless lie at the cluster redshift ( see also hilker et al .",
    "deeper imaging and spectroscopic studies have now revealed populations of fainter ucds in the fornax ( @xcite ; drinkwater et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) and virgo @xcite clusters , as well as some likely ucds in abell 1689 @xcite .",
    "the nature of ucds is still uncertain , but one intriguing possibility , suggested by their apparent rarity in the field ( liske et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) , is that they are the product of the cluster environment .",
    "clusters are known to harbor unusual galaxy populations , rarely encountered elsewhere .",
    "one conspicuous example is provided by the class of ` nucleated ' dwarfs ( de , n ) originally discovered in the virgo cluster @xcite , which represent a large fraction of dwarfs in clusters but have far fewer counterparts in nearby groups ( in the local group only ngc205 and the sagittarius dwarf may be regarded as nucleated ) .",
    "bekki et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2003 ) proposed that stripping of the low surface brightness envelopes around nucleated dwarfs may produce a compact remnant , whose properties would be comparable to ucds ( `` galaxy threshing '' )",
    ".    a test of this hypothesis can be made by comparing the structural properties of ucds and de , n nuclei .",
    "we present here the results of such a study carried out using images from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "we adopt virgo and fornax distance moduli of 30.92 and 31.39 mag .",
    ", respectively , from cepheid distances @xcite and extinctions derived from the maps of @xcite .",
    "the five original fornax ucds ( @xcite,@xcite ) and one fornax nucleated dwarf ( fcc303 ) were observed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis  woodgate et al .",
    "1998 ) through the ` open ' ( 50ccd ) filter in cycle  8 ( go-8685 ) .",
    "exposure times were 1680 seconds , broken down into at least 5 dither positions for cosmic ray removal and to better sample the point spread function .",
    "we also use images of virgo nucleated dwarfs taken as part of the acs virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs  ct et al . 2004 ) and observed with the hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) through the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters , with total exposure times of 750 and 1120 seconds , respectively .",
    "these images were retrieved as fully processed , drizzled and sky subtracted files from the hst archive and analyzed as described below .    for stis images of the ucds , we ran the iraf task ` ellipse ' @xcite to derive the surface brightness profile , which we calibrated on to the ab system , with a correction to place the open filter data on the @xmath2 filter scale , assuming a solar spectral energy distribution , as specified in the stis online manual .",
    "the 50ccd bandpass is very broad and this makes the transformation dependent on the underlying spectral energy distribution .",
    "most realistic spectra , however , do not have a significantly different correction from our assumed solar value .",
    "the profiles are presented in figure  1 .",
    "most ucds have exponential profiles with very similar scale lengths and central surface brightnesses ; only ucd3 is markedly different from all other objects , in that it is much more extended and has a flatter central core than the other ucds : this object is fitted reasonably well by a @xcite profile , with ( possibly ) a small central excess .",
    "we carried out the same procedure for the stis image of fcc303 and for the acs images of the de , n .",
    "we modelled the envelope of these galaxies using a @xcite profile , regarded as the best model for such objects @xcite .",
    "we removed the model halo profile from the data , leaving only the photometric residual of the nucleus .",
    "figure  1 also shows the results of this procedure for fcc303 ( observed with stis ) and a selection of the virgo de , n observed with acs .",
    "we will use these data to compare the properties of nuclei and ucds .    as part of this process",
    "we also determine the luminosities and colors of the nuclei , using a @xmath3 aperture from which we remove the flux from the underlying galaxy by integrating the sersic profiles derived above .",
    "we use the ishape software @xcite , assuming a circular plummer profile @xcite and using a point spread function generated by tinytim @xcite , to determine half - light radii for the nuclei .",
    "we also derive the color for the host galaxy in the inner @xmath3 .",
    "these data are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "we put these data on the more commonly used vega system , rather than the ab system used in the figures ( conversion of stis open filter data to the vega system is not straightforward and requires assumptions as to the underlying spectral energy distribution ; hence , we prefer to use ab values for these comparisons ) .",
    "errors for galaxy properties are derived from the sersic profiles and errors for nuclear quantities are determined by assuming that the counts obey poisson statistics and adding errors in quadrature .",
    "errors for the size of the nucleus are difficult to determine , but @xcite suggests that the half - light radii should be accurate to about 10% for data of good quality .",
    "table 1 lists the properties of nuclei : absolute @xmath0 magnitude ( on the vega system ) , @xmath4 color , half - light radius ( from the plummer profile ) and the @xmath4 color of the center of the host galaxy .",
    "we also tabulate the @xmath2 magnitude of the ucds , calculated over a large aperture whose size is determined with reference to the profiles shown in figure 1 , and their half - light radius for a plummer profile ( except for ucd fornax 3 , which resembles a srsic profile more closely ) .",
    "the properties of the nuclei ( other than their magnitude and structure ) are of secondary importance for our discussion , but these de , n nuclei resemble bright globular clusters @xcite while the nuclei are somewhat bluer than the underlying galaxy , as found by @xcite for a sample observed with wfpc2 .",

    "these profiles were scaled to parsecs , based on published cepheid distances to the fornax and virgo clusters .",
    "the profiles are not deconvolved , but the psf is only relevant for the inner @xmath60 while we compare structures on scales of @xmath3@xmath61 .",
    "none of the nuclei , with the possible exception of vcc856 ( ic3328 ) and fcc303 ( and vcc1431 which is not shown ) , is similar to the mean ucd profile .",
    "even for the nuclei of vcc856 , vcc1431 and fcc303 s nuclei , however , there is a discrepancy at large radii , where ucds are more extended . in general , nuclei appear to have smaller sizes , lower surface brightnesses , and , to the extent that this is can be determined given the effects of the point spread function , steeper profiles than ucds : ucds have half - light radii of about 20 pc ( cf .",
    "drinkwater et al .",
    "2003 ) , while nuclei have typical sizes of less than 10 pc . while the ucds are generally more luminous than nuclei , even nuclei of similar luminosity to the ucds tend to be physically smaller .",
    "ucd3 shows a more extended light distribution but broadly resembles the other ucds at smaller radii , suggesting that it may represent a transitional object between normal dwarf ellipticals and ucds .",
    "@xcite model the formation of ucds by removal of the envelope from dwarf elliptical galaxies through tidal interactions with the gravitational potentical of the central galaxy .",
    "these simulations show that the remnant nuclei properties are not significantly changed by the threshing process ( e.g. figure 4 in bekki et al .",
    "if such is the case , the fornax ucds studied here can not be formed by the extraction of nuclei from typical de galaxies analyzed here .",
    "the only exception to this appears to be vcc856 .",
    "this dwarf galaxy is known to possess a system of weak spiral arms and , possibly , a central bar @xcite : vcc856 may be a dwarf example of the class of anemic spirals @xcite encountered in clusters .",
    "the possibility that ucds represent remnant nuclei of dwarf spirals rather than dwarf ellipticals has been mentioned by @xcite and the similarity between the nucleus of vcc856 and ucds offers some support to this hypothesis ( e.g. , moore et al .",
    "vcc1431 and fcc303 , however , do not possess the obvious spiral structure observed in vcc856 .",
    "one caveat is that the nuclei observed in the acs virgo cluster survey may be biased somehow to smaller objects , although @xcite state that the survey is designed to observe 100 galaxies fairly drawn from the virgo cluster catalog of @xcite .",
    "the colors and luminosities of the nuclei presented in table 1 are consistent with the larger sample of @xcite .",
    "we have also determined sizes for these latter nuclei and find that the size distribution for nuclei observed with wfpc2 is consistent with the one presented in table 1 .",
    "this argues that the acsvcs samples the population of de nuclei without obvious bias .",
    "it is possible that the brighter fornax ucds are not proper representatives of the general ucd population ; their similar structures and surface brightnesses suggest that we may be observing an extreme sample ( the ` tip of the iceberg ' effect ) while the fainter ucds now discovered in the fornax and virgo clusters may be closer counterparts to the nuclei of typical surviving de .",
    "a series of hst acs hrc ( high resolution camera ) snapshots for these objects is now being acquired and will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "the 5 ucds in this study are the brightest known in fornax , and the real possibility exists that they have been selectively descended from de with particularly bright nuclei . a more extensive sample of ucds and des imaged with hst can explore their connection more fully .",
    "to this end , we now have an ongoing hrc high resolution camera snapshot survey of ucds in both fornax and virgo ; this should produce a sample of 25 objects reaching 1 - 2 magnitudes fainter than the small stis sample .",
    "the simulations carried out to date may not have sufficient resolution to model the transition of a de in a cluster environment accurately , and perhaps there are additional physical processes which come into play to cause the excess light at large radii in the ucds .",
    "progress will be made via the interplay of the deeper and multicolor datasets now in progress with hst in both the fornax and virgo clusters .",
    "these more extensive samples can drive improved modeling , perhaps providing definitive tests for understanding the origin of ucds .",
