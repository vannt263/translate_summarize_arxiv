    "the long and involved history of increasingly more accurate and precise measurements of the hubble constant has resulted in an extensive list of more than 550 @xmath0 values recorded by huchra.huchra/. ] rowan - robinson ( 2009 ) notes that most recent ( central ) estimates of @xmath0 lie in the range of 62 to 72 @xmath3 , although individual estimates can differ amongst themselves by 2 or 3 standard deviations ( for recent reviews see jackson 2007 ; tammann et al .  2008 ; freedman & madore 2010 ) .",
    "while this is unfortunate , and perhaps not unexpected , huchra s extensive compilation may be used to derive a more precise meta - estimate of @xmath0 that is more robust than any individual estimate .",
    "we follow gott et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter g01 ) and use median statistics to determine what huchra s @xmath0 central values alone ( i.e. , ignoring the quoted errors ) tell us about the true value and uncertainty of the hubble constant .",
    "affects the uncertainty in other cosmological parameters determined from some cosmological tests , see , e.g. , wilson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , wan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , samushia et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2010 ) , zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , sen & scherrer ( 2008 ) , and dantas et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . ] with about two - third more data than g01 ( 553 measurements versus 331 ) , we confirm and strengthen the results of g01 . measurements .",
    "] we also examine how the estimated value of @xmath0 changes as we consider different subsamples of the complete list , and argue that the estimate from the complete list is a robust estimate of the hubble constant .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first review some basic median statistics concepts from g01 in the following section . in sec .",
    "3 these are applied in an analysis of huchra s @xmath0 list , where we also discuss some consistency tests and give constraints on the hubble constant .",
    "we conclude in sec .  4 .",
    "compared to a @xmath4 analysis , a median statistics analysis requires fewer hypotheses and is much less sensitive to being biased by outliers .",
    "see g01 for a comprehensive introduction to median statistics and its applications . here",
    "we restate the basic idea from g01 and emphasize some key points that are relevant to our analysis .",
    "the basic idea of median statistics is that the true value of a physical quantity is the median of the set of ( error - affected ) measurements .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the data set meets two statistical requirements : ( 1 ) all the measurements are independent ; and , ( 2 ) there is no ( overall ) systematic error for the whole data set as a group . in other words , as the number of independent measurements goes to infinity , the median will converge to the true value .",
    "the median does not depend on the measurement errors ( g01 ) .",
    "consider a data set consisting of @xmath5 measurements for a quantity that meets the two requirements above .",
    "sort the @xmath5 measurements from the lowest value to the highest and label them @xmath6 respectively , where @xmath7 .",
    "then the probability that the true value for the quantity lies between @xmath6 and @xmath8 is @xmath9 where we set @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( g01 ) .",
    "the range from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 ) defines a confidence limit ( hereafter c.l . ) of @xmath15 percent where @xmath16 the @xmath15 s are a finite number of discrete values , with the number depending on @xmath5 .",
    "so for any confidence limit commonly used , for example , the 95% c.l .",
    ", we take the c.l .  corresponding to the @xmath15 which is the smallest among those larger than 95 ( g01 ) .",
    "these confidence limits do not depend on the measurement errors ( g01 ) .",
    "note that the systematic error in the second requirement above is different from the individual systematic error quoted as part of the error for an individual measurement .",
    "if the systematic errors for the individual measurements are not correlated , we can treat them as random errors when combining individual measurements of a whole data set , as discussed in g01 and below , and the total error can be estimated by studying the histogram of the whole data set , without going in to details of the error analysis .",
    "but if all measurements are affected by the same systematic shift , i.e. , there is a systematic error at the whole data set level , a median statistics analysis will give an incorrect result .",
    "this is unlikely to be an issue for the @xmath0 data ( g01 ) .",
    "the intermediate case is that a subgroup of data share a similar individual systematic error .",
    "here we use ` subgroup systematic ' error to denote the part of individual systematic errors that are common to all measurements within the subgroup .",
    "subgroup systematic error is likely the main reason that the first requirement above ( statistical independence ) is not satisfied .",
    "one estimate of the error contribution from this effect may be derived by dividing the @xmath5 measurements into subgroups that belong to different measurement techniques ( measurements in each such subgroup could very likely be affected by similar systematic effects ) , and then studying the differences between results from each subgroup ( g01 ) .",
    "the final version of huchra s hubble constant measurements list , updated on october 7 , 2010 , contains 553 published estimates ( rounded to the nearest 1 @xmath3 ) , some as recent as september 2010 .",
    "all but three of them come with error bars .",
    "most include both statistical and systematical errors , although a few have only statistical errors . in this paper",
    "we use only the quoted central @xmath0 value , and not the error , for each measurement . for simplicity",
    ", we also use a dimensionless number @xmath17 instead of @xmath0 , where @xmath18 .    aside from some that restate previous results , most values on huchra s list are measurements that are either from different observations ( different raw data ) , different data processings ( including calibration and correction ) , or different methods ( different relation between distance and observable ) , and may include different biases .",
    "each of these has an associated error , any of which may make the final @xmath0 value differ significantly .",
    "there are examples where the same observations and the same estimation technique results in differences as large as two standard deviations ( see , for example , rowan - robinson 2009 ) .",
    "the complexity of error sources , and the difference in systematic errors estimated by different workers in the field , make it a worthy goal to use median statistics to derive a summary estimate of @xmath0 from huchra s list .",
    "all but one measurement in huchra s list have a primary type label that indicates method used , and less than half of them also have a secondary type label that indicates the `` research group '' involved . for four measurements in the list the type labels in huchra",
    "s list file look ambiguous .",
    "we picked their type labels according to our understanding of both the corresponding references as well as huchra s definition of types .",
    "( the revised list file is available upon request . )",
    "the primary type provide a simple , but quite likely typical ( g01 ) , criteria for the subgroup study . for conciseness , we focus on the primary type classification in the text , mentioning secondary type results ( shown along with the primary type results in table 1 and fig .",
    "1 ) only when necessary .",
    "more sophisticated classification schemes require a careful analysis of the systematic effects , which is beyond the purview of this paper .      a median statistics analysis of the 553 @xmath0 values results in a median @xmath19 and 95% statistical confidence limits of @xmath20 .",
    "ideally , @xmath21 can be quoted as the expected value and corresponding 2@xmath22 error . however , caution is in order when quoting these because the two requirements of median statistics are very likely not fully met by this @xmath0 list .",
    "there are two main concerns here : systematic errors that are shared by some of the measurements ( those in a subgroup ) and the restating of prior results ( in proceedings and summary papers ) which result in ` restating ' correlations .",
    "both of these effects make measurements in the list statistically dependent .",
    "since we do not make use of the error information from the list , we will refer to these effects as ( subgroup ) systematic errors . as mentioned in sec .  2",
    ", we can only check the reliability of the above results by studying the effects of subgroup systematics , since we choose to ignore the individual errors .",
    "we first group the 553 measurements into 18 subgroups according to the primary type label value in huchra s list file .",
    "the size of each subgroup and the corresponding median statistics results are shown in table 1 , while fig .",
    "1 shows the histograms for all but the two smallest primary type subgroups .",
    "notice that the subgroup medians are different , and many differences between two subgroups are larger than half of the 95% confidence range of either group .",
    "it is fair to say that most subgroups have a ` subgroup systematic ' error which is close to their median minus the true value , and , within each subgroup , statistical errors result in different measurements having different values .",
    "clearly , systematic errors for different subgroups have different signs and different values .",
    "following g01 , from the line labelled ` subgroup medians ' in the table , we see that @xmath23 @xmath3 is a reasonable estimate of the @xmath24% systematic errors . furthermore , considering the debates about systematic errors in this field , it is possible that the subgroup systematic errors are complex enough that we can consider them as pseudo - random errors at the level of the whole list ( g01 ) . in this case",
    "we can use these 18 subgroup medians to estimate the overall uncertainty .",
    "the result is @xmath25 ( 95% total error ) .",
    "total error of @xmath26 @xmath3 .",
    "] this may be quoted as a conservative constraint on the hubble constant since we are pretty sure that the 18 measurements ( i.e. , the subgroup medians ) are statistically independent .",
    "now the ` all data ' result has an extremely small uncertainty ( 95% confidence level ) range of 2 @xmath3 , while the ` subgroup medians ' has a relatively large one , 11 @xmath3 .",
    "but since the number of measurements ( @xmath5 ) affects the uncertainty estimate in a manner similar to the @xmath27 factor in mean statistics ( g01 ) , we can not simply conclude that the larger error estimate includes more uncertainty information ( the so - called systematic errors , g01 ) than the smaller one . to examine the effect of subgroup size on the uncertainty estimate",
    "we perform a simulation .",
    "the simulation randomly regroups the 553 measurements into 18 subgroups of the same sizes listed in table 1 , and computes the median statistics of the subgroup medians of these new subgroups . regrouping 100 times results in 100 sets of median statistics values ( each set consists of the median of 18 subgroup medians and corresponding 95% confidence limits ) .",
    "the median of the 100 95% c.l .",
    "ranges is 5 @xmath3 , with the largest one equal to 10 @xmath3 .",
    "so we see that the uncertainty estimates from the 18 group medians in table 1 , 11 @xmath3 , does indeed include a source of systematic error .",
    "this confirms that it is reasonable to use @xmath28 as the 95% total error .",
    "one concern regarding the above results is that the median of ` all data ' , @xmath29 , may be effected by subgroup systematics . to check this",
    ", we perform a median statistics analysis of truncated lists of measurements , truncated by excluding one subgroup of measurements at a time .",
    "we only exclude the largest subgroups , since excluding a subgroup with only a few measurements does not result in a discernible change .",
    "the results are shown in the right hand part of table 1 .",
    "we see that excluding any single subgroup does not significantly alter the median and c.l .",
    "range , at least in comparison to the 95% total error above .",
    "we ignore the ` no 2nd type ' results here because it is not really a type and also has too many measurements included .",
    "the only suspicious cases are that excluding the ` global summary ' set , where the 95% c.l .",
    "range expands most , from 2 to 4 @xmath3 , and that excluding the ` sandage ' set , where the median changes most , from 68 to 70 @xmath3 .",
    "the two subgroups picked out above have relatively smaller 95% c.l",
    ".   ranges .",
    "another subgroup that has a similar small 95% c.l .",
    "range is the ` key project ' type .",
    "we also point out here that the ` global summary ' type includes results from many summary papers , and is likely the main contributor to ` restating ' correlations . if we look at the histograms of the subgroups ( fig .  1 )",
    ", we see that , except for these three subgroups , the scatter within each subgroup is pretty large compared to 2 @xmath3 , the 95% range for the 553 measurements , even after considering the approximate @xmath27 factor effect . that may explain why none of these subgroups affect the median of ` all data ' significantly . as a further check ,",
    "we construct a subsample that contains all the measurements except those belonging to either the primary type ` global summary ' or the secondary type ` key project ' or ` sandage ' .",
    "there are 362 measurements in this subsample and the median and 95% confidence limits are 68 and @xmath30 @xmath3 .",
    "another consistency check is a `` historical '' analysis ( g01 ) .",
    "here we consider two subsamples .",
    "one , ` hst era ' set , only includes the 367 measurements post 1996 , the other , ` post g01 ' set , only includes the 196 measurements added to huchra s list after g01 .",
    "the corresponding results are 67 and @xmath31 @xmath3 , and 69 and @xmath32 @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "note that there are 13 papers in huchra s list added after g01 , although they predate g01 .",
    "these are not included in the ` post g01 ' . as a reference",
    ", we also compute for two more subsamples , ` pre - hst ' and ` pre - g01 ' , that are the complements of the above subsamples respectively .",
    "the pre - hst set gives 71 and @xmath33 @xmath3 , while the pre - g01 set gives 67 and @xmath31 @xmath3 , identical to the g01 result .    as a consequence of these consistency checks",
    ", we believe that the ` all data ' median and the 95% c.l .",
    "range of ` subgroup medians ' are fairly robust and together provide a reasonable summary estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "we use median statistics to study huchra s list of 553 hubble constant measurements . ignoring the errors associated with individual measurements , and assuming",
    "there is no systematic error at the whole list level , we determine a constraint on @xmath0 .",
    "we use the median of the complete list and estimate the error by only sampling one value , the median , from every primary type of subgroup , in an attempt to eliminate any possible correlations .",
    "this constraint is @xmath34 @xmath3 , where the 95% error bar includes both systematic and statistical errors . by studying various data subsets ,",
    "we argue that this result is robust and so should be used as a summary estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "however , without diving into the detailed systematics of each measurement , the statistical independence required by the median statistics technique can not be conclusively established for the ` all data ' set . nevertheless , given the complexity of the systematic errors associated with measuring distances ( as evidenced by the heated debates about them ) , we believe that the above constraint is a reasonable summary value .",
    "it is probably significant that this lies in the middle of the ` low ' tammann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) value of @xmath35 @xmath3 and the ` high ' freedman & madore ( 2010 ) value of @xmath36 @xmath3 ( both 1@xmath22 errors ) .",
