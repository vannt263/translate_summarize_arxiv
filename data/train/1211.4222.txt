    "this weak diamagnetism , the concomitant zero electrical resistance , and the too large @xmath54 value from resistivity data may root in two phenomena : i. the presence of a minor sc impurity phase which forms a percolating sc network with an about 0.5k higher @xmath186 and much higher @xmath54 than the main phase , or , ii . , strong classical surface superconductivity of the main phase with a critical field @xmath188 .",

    "ptge@xmath141 is reported to be a superconductor with @xmath9 = 0.4k.@xcite the presence of these minority phases in the bapt@xmath13ge@xmath2 sample thus also can not explain the observation of a higher upper critical field value in resistivity data .    the resistive percolation ( a sc path ) at a higher temperature than the bulk @xmath9 hints at a modification of the surface layers of the grains of the majority skutterudite phase , probably due to crystallographic defects or strain .",
    "these effects will result in a larger scattering rate and a shorter mean free path of the charge carriers , thus making the superconductor dirtier , subsequently enlarging the effective penetration depth well above the bulk value .",
    "since the present samples are polycrystalline pieces , an estimate of the mean free path from the residual resistivity values by the standard formula@xcite is problematic and gives at best a lower limit for @xmath93 .",

    "on the surface , however , the superconductivity seems to be in the dirty limit , leading to much shorter coherence lengths than in the bulk .",

    "the temperature dependence of the superfluid density @xmath23 in all the compounds saturates exponentially in the low - temperature limit , which documents the absence of nodes in the superconducting gap function .",

    "these ratios are in fair agreement with the reduced specific heat jump @xmath199 from our previous study.@xcite the observation of field - independent @xmath5 values further supports the classical @xmath8-wave pairing scenario for these compounds .",

    "the origin of much higher upper critical fields observed in electrical resistivity measurements for the present bapt@xmath13ge@xmath2 sample ( as in previous reports@xcite ) is due to a larger carrier scattering rate at the surface of the crystallites .",
