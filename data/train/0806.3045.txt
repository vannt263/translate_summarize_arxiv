    "recent space missions , such as hinode @xcite and stereo @xcite , and ground - based facilities such as solis @xcite provide a set of data unprecedented in quality and cadence .",
    "the complementary observations from the different instruments provide the necessary spatial , temporal and temperature coverage to observe the dynamics of jets and polar plumes , helping to form a more complete picture of these structures .",
    "x - ray jets occur almost everywhere in the solar corona ( see * ? ? ?",

    "they are characterized by their transient nature and often appear as collimated high - temperature emissive beam guided by open magnetic flux ( length of @xmath2 km and collimated widths of @xmath3 km ; see * ? ? ?",

    "the present research is motivated by the fact that polar x - ray and euv jets and plumes usually share common properties .",

    "studying the relationship between jets and plumes is important to understand their formation processes , evolution and the eventual contributions to the solar wind and heating of the plasma in the polar coronal holes .",

    "observations of the southern coronal hole from xrt were utilized to study the evolution of polar x - ray jets and their relation with plumes .",
    "the data cover several time intervals on april 7 - 8 , 2007 ( 07 april : 03:30 - 06:59 ut and 18:29 - 23:59 ut ; 08 april : 11:49 - 17:59 ut and 21:30 - 22:59 ut ) with a cadence of less than a minute .",
    "the data were corrected for instrumental effects utilizing xrt - calibration procedures .",
    "a total of 28 x - ray jets were identified , with at least two recurring events within an hour .",
    "most of the events are characterized by sharp collimated beams .",
    "the observed jets have different properties with regards to brightness , spatial extension , lifetime , and evolution . the bright point at the base of each jet",
    "is enhanced in brightness with every eruption and then fades after the jet is no longer observed .",
    "in addition , 171   images from the stereo / secchi satellite `` a '' were utilized to study euv features in relation to the identified x - ray events .",
    "particular attention was given to the presence of plume material during or after the eruption of jets .",
    "the choice of 171   was dictated by the adequate temperature corresponding to polar plume emissions .",

    "events xj@xmath19 , xj@xmath20 and xj@xmath21 were adjacent to off - limb plume emission locations .",

    "x - ray and euv observations indicate that more than 90% of the jets observed in the southern polar hole on april 7 - 8 , 2007 are associated with plume haze .",
    "70% of these jets are followed by polar plumes with a time delay ranging from minutes to tens of minutes .",
    "emission of pre - existing plumes is enhanced after every jet eruption within their base .",
    "a number of prominent plumes ( e.g. , p@xmath22 and p@xmath23 ) show evidence for short lived , jet - like events in the euv that occur within the plume base ( see the sharp structures fig .  [ fig_letter_080407_0332ut](f ) & ( h ) and the several bright points in panel ( i ) ) .",
    "jet - like events ensure the continuous rise of haze and may contribute to the change in plume brightness ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the event xj@xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig_letter_080408_2240ut ] is an interesting case .",
    "it was observed in x - rays from 21:58 - 22:16 ut on april 8 , 2007 .",
    "[ fig_letter_080408_2240ut](d - e ) shows an euv collimated structure similar to the one observed in x - rays more than three hours earlier .",
    "this may be caused by the plasma being heated to several mk and then becoming visible in x - rays , then gradually cooling down until it appears in the euv range .",
    "more data needs to be analyzed to confirm the plausibility of this hypothesis .    the event xj@xmath18 , illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig_letter_080408_2240ut](c ) , is also peculiar and lasted less than 30 minutes . a narrow , collimated beam of plasma rose from the left edge of the large bright point with a shape typical of x - ray jets .",
    "it evolved rapidly and after 4 - 5 minutes the base width of the emission began to widen to cover the whole bright point .",
    "the width of the emitting structure exceeded 20  mm , which is the typical width of polar plumes ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "euv images showed a faint haze several hours after the x - ray event ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_letter_080408_2240ut]d - i ) .",
    "gong magnetograms show that the flux at the base of xj@xmath18 weakened during the event s lifetime .",
    "we believe that the initial jet event evolved into a plume due to significant emerging magnetic flux causing a catastrophic magnetic reconnection on a relatively short time scale but over a large spatial area .",
    "this may allow dissipation of the magnetic energy budget of the structure over a short period of time with an associated ejection of a significant amount of material over a relative large spatial scale , unlike other jet - plume events that develop over intervals of several hours .",
    "this type of event is recorded twice in the data set utilized here .",
    "it is likely that jets play a key role in the formation process of polar plumes .",
    "both coronal structures share numerous common characteristics , i.e. , a magnetic field of mixed polarities at the base , leading to magnetic reconnection .",
    "we believe that the magnetic flux emergence causes the jet , opening of previously closed flux results in plume .",
    "jet eruption seems to be the result of gradually emerging magnetic flux from the solar interior that suddenly reconnects on a small scale with the ambient photospheric field , leading to a collimated beam of plasma rising in the corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "euv images show that coronal plume haze is observed following the jet events .",
    "they also provide evidence for several small bright points and short - lived , jet - like events within the base of the plume",
    ". these may be the results of magnetic reconnection at smaller spatio - temporal scales that modulate and sporadically brighten pre - existing polar plumes .",
    "this is most often seen in long - lived polar plumes , since several phases of reconnection can develop in a single long - lived structure .",
    "however , fast opening of magnetic flux can allow a plume to develop almost immediately such as in the case of the xj@xmath18 event .",
    "the transition from fast , impulsive , magnetically - driven dynamics of reconnection to the thermal expansion of newly liberated gas along opened magnetic field could explain the time delay observed between the jet and plume events .",
    "on the one hand , the jet eruption is the result of fast and explosive dissipation of magnetic energy on a short time scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the plume might be a result of a pressure gradient within the open flux , which would lift the plume material in the corona .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the fact that plasma outflow velocities in plumes are measured to be rather low up to @xmath24 above the solar surface .",
    "the continuous emergence of magnetic flux at a slow rate and relatively large scale might ultimately create a sizable bundle of newly opened flux , allowing in turn a significant plume of escaping plasma to develop .",
    "if a bipolar field emerges into a unipolar , open field region , then the two fields are not , in general , exactly parallel across the boundary between them .",
    "then , according to parker s ( 1994 ) theory , a magnetic tangential discontinuity forms and current dissipation and field reconnection become inevitable at this boundary .",
    "any two non - parallel fields can be resolved into parallel and anti - parallel components .",
    "the anti - parallel components will mutually annihilate at the discontinuity .",
    "the dissipated magnetic energy is partially converted to kinetic and thermal energy , which would cause a jet of energized plasma to escape along the open field next to the dissipating current sheet . whenever some quantity of open flux is locally annihilated along the current sheet an equal quantity of closed flux",
    "must become open for magnetic flux continuity ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this open flux can allow a plume of thermally expanding plasma , formerly trapped by its closed field , to escape .    a jet model with a single magnetic neutral point such as yokoyama & shibata s ( 1996 ) anenome jet model",
    "( see their figure 1 ) could also result in a plume .",
    "energy gained from emerging flux is converted to kinetic and thermal energy at the x - type neutral point during reconnection producing a jet of energized plasma .",
    "when the field has reconnected , there is a bundle of newly - opened magnetic flux through which hitherto trapped coronal plasma can escape as a plume .",
