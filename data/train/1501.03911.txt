    "nowadays , one of the most sensitive and crucial region in the nuclear chart for investigation is laying in between @xmath2= 35@xmath164 and @xmath3= 82@xmath1132 .",
    "this region reveals a large number of interesting discoveries of new phenomena , such as proton radioactivity @xcite , cluster radioactivity @xcite , exotic shapes @xcite , _ island of inversion _",
    "@xcite , abnormal variation of major shell closures ( i.e. extra stability near drip - line ) @xcite and giant halo near neutron drip - line region @xcite etc .",
    "these crucial features may be due to the rapid growing possibility of the neutron - proton ratio ( @xmath4 ) in a nucleus .",
    "from last few decades , it is possible to study these exotic nuclei by using the radioactive isotope beams ( rib ) facilities .",
    "this reveals the new concept entitled as _ aforementioned _ magic number . in other word , the confirmation of magic number near @xmath5stability line are not mandatory universal @xcite .",
    "further , the structural properties of nuclei far away from the @xmath5stability line are also active areas of research in both theories and experiments @xcite . in particular , the neutron - rich zr@xmath1 , mo@xmath1 , ru@xmath1 and pd@xmath1 with mass numbers @xmath3 = 100@xmath1130 are of special interest for various reasons . for example , they lie far away from the @xmath5stable region of _ nuclear landscape _ , result in a well established deformation , but close enough in the magnitude of microscopic excitations to compete with the collectivity of double shell closure nuclei @xcite . moreover , these nuclei are also holding an active participation in the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei in astrophysical _ r-_process .",
    "the mass and decay properties are quite an essential ingredient to building up the path , the isotopic abundances and the time period of these process @xcite .    in addition to that the nuclear structure of these nuclei is characterized by a strong competition between various shapes , which gives rise to the shape instabilities that lead to coexistence nuclear shape transitions in the isotopic chains @xcite .",
    "this could be understood from the potential energy surface at different deformations .",
    "elaborately , the occurrence of two ( or more ) nearly equally deep minima in the potential energy surface at different deformations show the signature for nuclear shape coexistence .",
    "hence , one can say the nuclear shape are not only vary with the nucleon number but also with the excitation energy and spin .",
    "it is well known that the binding energy of a nucleus is one of the most precise measured observable from the experiments @xcite .",
    "several nuclear observables which are highly relevant for understanding various features of the nuclear structure can be computed from its mass such as the average nuclear field , nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential , single particle energy etc .",
    "the correlations among these fundamental quantities are amended to explain the deformed ground states , low - lying isomeric states and few derived quantities like moments of inertia and vibrational excitation energy etc @xcite .",
    "it is acclaimed that the energy involved in removal of fermions from a strongly correlated system of identical fermions must be a good indicator for the stability of the system .",
    "this magnitude of this energy has much higher values for systems with _ even _ number of particles than _ odd _",
    "one , if the pairing is a dominant component in the binary _ fermion@xmath1fermion _ interaction .    in this present work ,",
    "the quantities of interest are the nuclear potential energy surface , nuclear shape , nuclear binding energy , two neutron separation energies ( @xmath6 ) , the differential variation of neutron separation energy @xmath7 , the root - mean - square charge distribution @xmath8 and the single particle energy level for the _ even - even _ mass transition nuclei .",
    "base on these decisive observables , we have focused on the evolution on the structural properties of transition nuclei . the paper is organized as follows : section ii gives a brief description of the relativistic mean field formalism including the pairing energy correlation .",
    "the results of our calculation along with discussions are presented in section iii .",
    "section iv includes a short summary along with few concluding remarks .",
    "from last few decades , the nuclear covariant density functional theories ( cdft ) are quite successful in describing the ground and the intrinsic excited state including fission states of the exotic heavy and superheavy nuclei over the nuclear chart @xcite .",
    "basically , there are four different patterns to perform the covariant density functional : the point coupling nucleon or meson exchange interactions connected with the density - dependent or nonlinear couplings .",
    "one can also introduced all shape degrees of freedom to cdfts by breaking both the axial and reflection symmetries simultaneously ( see the ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . in the relativistic mean field approach ,",
    "the nucleus is considered as a composite system of nucleons ( proton and neutron ) interacting through exchanges of mesons and photons @xcite .",
    "further , the contributions from the meson fields are described either by mean fields or by point - like interactions between the nucleons @xcite . and the density dependent coupling constants @xcite or nonlinear coupling terms @xcite",
    "are introduced to reproduced the correct saturation properties of infinite nuclear matter . here , most of the computational efforts are devoted to solving the dirac equation and to calculate various densities . in the present calculation",
    ", we have used the microscopic self - consistent relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory as a standard tool to investigate the nuclear structure phenomena .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the rmf approach is one of the most popular and widely used formalism among them .",
    "the relativistic lagrangian density ( after several modification of the original walecka lagrangian to take care of various limitations ) for a nucleon - meson many body system @xcite is given as : @xmath9 from the above lagrangian , we obtain the field equations for the nucleons and mesons .",
    "these equations are solved by expanding the upper and lower components of the dirac spinors and the boson fields in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator basis , with an initial deformation @xmath10 .",
    "the set of coupled equations are solved numerically by a self - consistent iteration method @xcite .",
    "based on the effective interactions used in the rmf functional , the center of mass energy can be calculated either in harmonic oscillator approximation or from the quasi - particle vacuum self - consistently . in case of oscillator approximation ,",
    "the spurious center of mass motion is substracted using the elliott - skyrme approximation @xcite .",
    "the analytical form is given as : @xmath11 where @xmath3 is the mass number .",
    "in other hand , one should estimate the center of mass energy using self - consistent method @xcite , @xmath12 where , @xmath13 wave function .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath3 are the total linear momentum and the nuclear mass number , respectively .",
    "the results obtained from these two methods for zr isotopes are given in table i. from the table it is clear that , the calculated center of mass energies from both the cases are almost overlap with each other . hence , one can use any one of the method for the center of mass energy correction in the calculation of this nuclear mass region ( see ref .",
    "the total quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath15 is evaluated from the resulting proton and neutron quadrupole moments , as @xmath16 the root mean square ( rms ) matter radius is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath3 is the mass number , and @xmath18 is the axially deformed density . the total binding energy and other observables",

    "in the present work , we have used the successful nl3 @xcite and the recently proposed nl3 * @xcite force parameters , which are excellent in the description of ground and excited states with many collective aspect for spherical and deformed nuclei . in the mean time",
    ", there are several other mean - field interactions have been developed . in particular ,",
    "the density dependent meson - exchange dd - me1 @xcite and dd - me2 @xcite interactions , which are adjusted to improve the isovector channel .",
    "further , the density dependent points coupling interaction @xcite has been developed to describe the deformed heavy and superheavy nuclei .",
    "even these interactions have been developed to provide a very successful description of various special features . at present , the @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite forces are also accepted in compete with these parameters to reproduce the properties of the stable and nuclei far from the @xmath21-stability line . in rmft , the mean - field equations are solved self - consistently by taking different inputs of the initial deformation called @xmath22 @xcite . to verify the convergence of the ground state solutions for this mass region",

    "this realative changes are reduced to @xmath32 0.002@xmath33 on binding energy and 0.001@xmath33 on nuclear radii for @xmath24 value from 14 to 22 .",
    "hence , the desired number of major shells for fermions and bosons are @xmath24 = 18 and @xmath23 = 20 for the considered mass region . however , the number of mesh points for gauss - hermite and gauss - lagurre integration are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . for a given nucleus",

    "1 ]      conventionally , in case of a quantum mechanical system , the path followed by the different solutions at various deformation define a potential barrier or potential energy surface , which can be used for the determination of the ground state of a nucleus .",
    "more elaborately , from the potential energy surface ( pes ) obtained from a self - consistent relativistic mean field theory , one can regulate the reasonable results for the ground state similar to the non - relativistic calculations @xcite .",
    "since quadrupole deformation plays the most important and dominant part , we have neglected the other deformation coordinates in the present study for simplicity and low computation time cost . here",

    "the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xcite at certain deformation is given as , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the constraint multiplier and @xmath39 is the dirac mean field hamiltonian .",
    "the convergence of the numerical solutions on the binding energy and the deformation are not very much sensitive to the deformation parameter @xmath22 of the harmonic oscillator basis for the considered range due to the large basis .",
    "thus the deformation parameter @xmath22 of the harmonic oscillator basis is chosen near the expected deformation to obtain high accuracy and less computation time period .",

    "<S> in this theoretical study , we report an investigation on the behavior of two - neutron separation energy , a differential variation of the nucleon separation energy , the nuclear charge radii and the single - particle energy levels along the isotopic chains of transitional nuclei . we have used the relativistic mean field formalism with nl3 and nl3@xmath0 forces for this present analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the study refers to the _ even - even _ nuclei such as zr , mo , ru and pd for n = 42@xmath186 , where a rich collective phenomena such as proton radioactivity , cluster or nucleus radioactivity , exotic shapes , _ island of inversion _ and etc . are observed . </S>",
    "<S> we found that there are few non - monotonic aspects over the isotopic chain , which are correlated with the structural properties like shell / sub - shell closures , the shape transition , clustering and magicity etc . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these , we have shown the internal configuration of these nuclei to get a further insight into the reason for these discrepancies . </S>"
