    "@xcite argue that the spectral inflection detected by pamela and cream experiments  @xcite at rigidities @xmath7gev could mark the limit between cr diffusion in self - generated turbulence and diffusion in the pre - existing turbulence . in galactic cr propagation codes  @xcite , this can be implemented by assuming a break in the diffusion coefficient at that rigidity , but it does not change the global effective picture of cr diffusion in the ism . we discuss in this work two topical subjects that can not be predicted by the da in its usual form .",
    "several observatories have detected anisotropies in the tev ",

    "these anisotropies have been observed both at large ( dipole ) and , more surprisingly , small angular scales ( higher order multipoles ) .",

    "ssa have been detected down to @xmath9 scales , with narrow regions receiving a flux larger or smaller than would be expected if only a dipole anisotropy were present .",
    "the da can not explain the ssa .",
    "we show in section  [ crasas ] that it is so because the da is not designed to predict phenomena arising on spatial scales smaller than the cr mean free path ( mfp ) : anisotropies naturally appear on small angular scales and reflect the local configuration of the turbulent magnetic field within a cr mfp from earth .    in section  [ acrd ] , we study the diffusion of high - energy galactic crs around their sources .",
    "we show that the simplifying hypothesis of isotropic diffusion is usually not acceptable .",
    "cr densities around sources should be expected to be irregular and , sometimes , to display filamentary structures .",
    "the da only predicts a dipole anisotropy .",
    "the direction and amplitude of the dipole @xmath10 are directly related to the local relative gradient of cr density @xmath11 by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the cr diffusion coefficient .",

    "previous works have assumed additional effects so as to explain the ssa , see for example refs .",

    "this statement is valid even in isotropic magnetic turbulence . in other words ,",
    "the da does not predict ssa because it loses its validity on distances smaller than the cr mfp .",

    "crs arriving at earth during a time interval @xmath19 are located within a sphere of radius @xmath18 . assuming a gradient of cr density @xmath20 at earth , one then only finds a dipole anisotropy in the direction of @xmath20 , with the amplitude predicted by the da .",
    "however , in reality , the magnetic turbulence has a given configuration , and crs do not travel on straight lines within this sphere of radius @xmath21 .",
    "the magnetic field within @xmath21 from earth does not vary significantly during the cr crossing time @xmath22 .",
    "this gives rise to anisotropies at medium and small scales by reshuffling pieces of the dipole to smaller scales , on different parts of the sky .",
    "equivalently , one can say that the da can not predict the ssa because it averages over all possible magnetic field configurations .",

    "the amplitude of ssa is about the same . in practice , crs with different rigidities are mixed ( different charges and broad energy ranges ) , which leads to a smaller amplitude because ssa are rigidity - dependent and values for different @xmath37 add non - constructively . taking a cr distribution with a median energy of 10pev and a relative width @xmath38 equal to that inferred for icecube measurements at 20tev ( see fig .  3 of ref .",
