    "huggins & miller ( 1864 ) obtained the first spectrum of a planetary nebula ( the cat s eye nebula ) , where they detected a bright emission line coming from a misterous element that huggins ( 1898 ) called `` nebulium '' .",
    "several decades after , bowen ( 1927 ) showed that this emission was produced by doubly ionized oxygen ( o@xmath0 ) .",
    "the first `` deep '' spectra of planetary nebulae ( hereinafter , pne ) were obtained by wyse ( 1942 ) , who detected for the first time very faint metal recombination lines of c  ii and o  ii in the spectrum of several pne and in the orion nebula .    since these early achievements in spectrophotometry of pne",

    "although this list does not intend to be complete , it is quite representative of the last advances in the field . to progress in the field of chemical abundances in ionized nebulae",
    "we need to obtain very deep spectra to detect the weakest lines and , additionally , we need the spectra to be of high resolution to properly measure important faint emission lines which are blended with other features . as it can be seen in table  [ table1 ] ,",
    "the deepest spectra of pne ( those of ngc7027 and ngc7009 ) have been taken at relatively low - resolution . however , the authors of these works did a very careful work of deblending using `` ad - hoc '' atomic physics .",
    "on the other hand , high - resolution spectra can reveal the kinematical structure of the nebula , resulting in different profiles depending on the excitation of the emitting ion ( see e.  g. sharpee et al .",

    "the _ abundance discrepancy problem _ is one of the major unresolved problems in nebular astrophysics and it has been around for more than seventy years ( since wyse 1942 ) .",
    "it consists in the fact that in photoionized nebulae  both h  ii regions and planetary nebulae ( pne) optical recombination lines ( orls ) provide abundance values that are systematically larger than those obtained using collisionally excited lines ( cels ) . solving this problem",
    "has obvious implications for the measurement of the chemical content of nearby and distant galaxies , because this task is most often done using cels from their ionized interstellar medium .    for a given ion , the abundance discrepancy factor ( adf )",
    "is defined as the ratio between the abundances obtained from orls and cels , i.  e. ,    @xmath7    and is usually between 1.5 and 3 in h  ii regions and the bulk of pne ( see e.  g. garca ",
    "rojas & esteban 2007 , mcnabb et al . 2013 ) , but in pne it has a significant tail extending to much larger values .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy has been discussed for many years and three main scenarios have been proposed : i ) the existence of temperature fluctuations over the observed volume of the nebula ( peimbert 1967 , torres ",
    "peimbert et al . 1980 ) ,",
    "b ) the presence of cold and dense h - poor droplets as the origin of the bulk of the orl emission ( e.  g. liu et al .",
    "2000 , stasiska et al .",
    "2007 , henney & stasiska 2010 ) , c ) the departure of the free electron energy distribution from the maxwellian distribution ( @xmath8-distribution , see nicholls et al .",
    "however , in the last years , several works have argued against the @xmath8-distribution as being esponsible for the abundance discrepancy in pne ( see mendoza & bautista 2014 , storey & sochi 2014 , ferland et al .",
    "unfortunately , there are so far not direct observational evidences that can favour any of these scenarios .    in the last 20 years the group led by prof .",
    "liu ( u. beijing ) have developed deep medium - resolution spectrophotometry of dozens of pne ( and high - resolution of a few pne , see mcnabb et al .",
    "2016 ) to compute the physical and chemical properties of these objects from orls . in one of the most detailed and comprehensive studies of this group , wang & liu ( 2007 ) showed that the values of the adf deduced for the four most abundant second - row heavy elements ( c , n , o and ne ) are comparable ( see their fig .",
    "however , they also computed abundances from orls from a third - row element ( mg ) and they found that the orl abundance of magnesium is compatible with the solar photospheric value ( even taking into account the small depletion expected for this element onto dust grains - less than 30% ) . finally , these authors also showed that , regardless of the value of the adf , both cel and orl abundances yield similar relative abundance ratios of heavy elements such as c / o , n / o and ne / o .",
    "this has important implications , especially in the case of the c / o ratio , given the difficulties of obtaining this ratio from cels ( see sect .",
    "[ co_ratio ] ) .",
    "the liu s group have strongly argued in favour of the inhomogeneus composition of pne and against pure temperature fluctuations .",
    "some of their arguments are the following : i ) far - ir [ o  iii ] cels , which in principle , have a much lower dependence on electron temperature than optical cels , provide abundances that are consistent with those derived from optical cels ( see e.  g. liu et al .",
    "2000 ) ; ii ) the analysis of the physical conditions using h , he , o and n orls yields electron temperatures that are much lower than those computed from classical cel diagnostic ratios ( see zhang et al .",
    "2004 , 2009 , tsamis et al .",
    "2004 , fang et al .",
    "2011 ) ; additionally , orl density diagnostics provide densities that are higher than those derived from cel diagnostics ; iii ) chemically homogeneous photoionization models do not reproduce the required temperature fluctuations to match cel and orl abundances , while bi - abundance photoionization models including an h - poor ( i.  e. metal - rich ) component of the gas successfully reproduce the observed intensities of both cels and orls ( e.  g. yuan et al .",
    "all these arguments strongly favour the presence of a low - mass component of the gas that is much colder and denser than the `` normal '' gas , and that is responsible for the bulk of the orl emission .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that different physical phenomena can contribute simultaneously to the abundance discrepancy in pne .",
    "some physical phenomena have been proposed to explain the abundance discrepancy in the framework of temperature fluctuations or chemical inhomogeneities scenarios ( peimbert & peimbert 2006 , liu 2006 ) .",
    "some recent works on the orion nebula have observationally linked the abundance discrepancy to the presence of high velocity flows ( mesa - delgado et al .",
    "2009 ) or to the presence of high density clumps , such as protoplanetary disks ( mesa  delgado et al 2012 , tsamis et al . 2011 ) . on the other hand , liu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found a very extreme value of the adf for the pn hf22 ( adf@xmath170 ) and , for the first time , speculated with the possibility that this large adf could be related to the fact that the central star of the pn , which is a close - binary star , has gone through a common - envelope phase .    by means of spectroscopic observations at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) in la palma , spain , corradi et al .",
    "2015 recently confirmed the hipothesis proposed by liu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that the largest abundance discrepancies are reached in pne with close - binary central stars , the most extreme object being the pn abell  46 , where we have found an adf(o@xmath0)@xmath1120 , and as high as 300 in its inner regions .",
    "their spectroscopic analysis supports the previous interpretation that , in addition to `` standard '' hot ( t@xmath9@xmath110@xmath10  k ) gas , a colder ( t@xmath9@xmath110@xmath11  k ) , metal - rich , ionized component also exists in these nebulae .",
    "both the origin of the metal - rich component and how the two gas phases are mixed in the nebulae are basically unknown . moreover , this dual nature is not predicted by mass - loss theories .",
    "however , it seems clear that the large - adf phenomena in pne is linked to the presence of a close - binary central star .",
    "in fact , wesson et al . (",
    "2017 ) recently completed a survey of the adfs in seven pne with known close - binary central stars and they found adfs larger than 10 for all of them , confirming the strong link between large adfs and close - binary central stars .",
    "on the other hand , several spectroscopic studies have shown that the orl emitting plasma is generally concentrated in the central parts of the pne .",
    "this occurs in pne with known close - binary central stars and large adfs ( e.  g. corradi et al .",
    "2015 , jones et al .",
    "2016 ) , in pne with low - to - moderate adfs and no indication of binarity ( e.  g. liu et al .",
    "2001 , garnett & dinerstein 2001 ) and in pne with relatively large adfs but no known close - binary central star ( e.  g. m142 , see climent 2016 , garca  rojas et al .",

    "rojas et al . ( 2016 ) recently obtained the first direct image of the pn ngc6778 ( a pn with adf@xmath120 ) in o  ii recombination lines , taking advantage of the tunable filters available at the osiris instrument in the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) .",
    "they found that in ngc  6778 , the spatial distribution of the o  ii @xmath3@xmath34649 + 50 orl emission does not match that of the [ o  iii ] @xmath35007 cel ( see fig .",
    "[ tf_orls ] ) .",
    "rojas et al . ( 2017 ) found the same behaviour in abell  46 using direct tunable filter images centred at @xmath124649 + 51  .",
    "moreover , garca ",
    "rojas et al . ( 2017 ) obtained deep 2d spectroscopic observations with muse at the 8.2 m very large telescope ( vlt ) of five southern large - adf pne , and they confirmed this behaviour in at least the pne hf  2 - 2 ( adf@xmath184 ) , m  1 - 42 and ngc6778 ( both with adf@xmath120 ) .",
    "these results clearly support the hypothesis of the existence of two separate plasmas , at least in these large - adf pne , with the additional indication that they are not well mixed , perhaps because they were produced in distinct ejection events related to the binary nature of the pn central star .",
    "wesson et al . ( 2017 ) propose that a nova - like outburst from the close - binary central star could be responsible for ejecting h - deficient material into the nebulae soon after the formation of the main nebula .",
    "the determination of accurate c / h and c / o ratios in h  ii regions is of paramount importance to constrain chemical evolution models of galaxies .",
    "moreover , c / o determinations in pne can also constrain nucleosynthesis processes in low - to - intermediate mass stars .",
    "however , the determination of c abundances in photoionized nebulae is difficult because , traditionally , c abundances have been derived from the semi - forbidden c  iii ] @xmath31909 and c  ii ] @xmath32326 cels in the uv , which can only be observed from space and whose intensity is strongly affected by interstellar reddening and extremely dependent on the electron temperature .    alternatively , there is a method to derive c abundances in ionized gas based on the faint c  ii @xmath34267 rl .",
    "thanks to the new ccds with improved efficiency in the blue and the use of large telescopes , several high - quality observations of the c  ii @xmath34267 rl in pne have been achieved in the last years ( e.  g. peimbert et al .",

    "c / o ratios derived from rls combined with other abundance ratios as n / o or he / h , can set strong constraints to the initial mass of pne progenitors .",
