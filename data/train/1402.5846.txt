    "the two peaks merge with each other and a broad peak can be seen at 1 t. increasing field to 2 t , the peak becomes much larger and a bit sharper and is locating at 0.96 k. however , this peak splits into a peak at 0.95 k and a lower shoulder at 0.77 k when magnetic field is increased to 3 t. increasing field further to 4 t , the peak shifts to 0.92 k while the shoulder - like feature disappears . for @xmath26 4 t ,",
    "the remained peak gradually moves to lower temperatures and can not be seen at temperature down to 0.4 k when the field is larger than 6 t. finally , a hump - like feature appears and gradually shifts to high temperatures for @xmath26 6 t. it resembles a schottky anomaly and is apparently related to the zeeman effect of the gd@xmath9 moments in the high - field paramagnetic state .",
    "all these phenomena are essentially consistent with the results reported previously,@xcite which were discussed to originate from the partial lift of degenerate states.@xcite the specific - heat data in @xmath20 [ 111 ] show rather similar behaviors to those in @xmath20 [ 110 ] , but with some obvious differences in the positions and magnitudes of those peaks , which indicates a non - negligible magnetic anisotropy of gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3.@xcite        figures 2(a)-2(c ) show the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature in zero and 14 t fields for different directions of magnetic field and heat current ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "apparently , the heat transport of gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 is almost isotropic in both zero and 14 t fields and is independent of the field direction .",
    "the zero - field @xmath28 curves exhibit a typical phonon transport behavior at high temperatures and large phonon peaks at about 10 k.@xcite it is notable that at the phase transitions from the high-@xmath5 paramagnetic state to the low-@xmath5 magnetically ordered state at 1.0 and 0.7 k , indicated by the specific - heat data , there is no obvious change of @xmath28 .",
    "it seems that the magnetic excitations of gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 have no obvious contribution to transporting heat .",
    "however , at low temperatures the @xmath0 is increased in 14 t , indicating that there is magnetic scattering on phonons in zero field that can be removed by applying high field.@xcite    the detailed magnetic - field dependencies of the low-@xmath5 thermal conductivities are shown in figs .",
    "2(d)-2(f ) .",
    "for three different configurations , @xmath6 isotherms show very similar behaviors . at very low temperatures",
    ", the @xmath0 shows some reduction at low fields , a step - like increase at about 6 t , and a high - field plateau . upon increasing temperature ,",
    "the low - field reduction is weakened and the transition at 6 t is broadened , accompanied with a decrease of the high - field plateau . at 1.95",
    "k , the @xmath0 is almost independent of field . at lowest temperature ,",
    "the high - field plateau is started from 78 t. from the specific - heat data , it is known that above 8 t the samples enter the paramagnetic or the high - field polarized state .",
    "therefore , the step - like increase and high - field plateau of @xmath0 are apparently originated from the quench of the phonon scattering by magnetic excitations ( magnons from the ordered state ) , when entering the spin - polarized state.@xcite this means that the low-@xmath5 thermal conductivity in high fields would be a phonon transport free from magnetic scattering .",
    "however , one may note that at sub - kelvin temperatures the 14-t @xmath28 curves have some obvious curvatures in the log - log plot instead of showing a power law close to @xmath29 . it is deviated from the expectation of a phonon heat transport in the boundary scattering limit.@xcite this unusual temperature dependence points to some peculiarity of the high - field magnetic state of gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , it is rather clear that magnons in this material mainly play a role of scattering phonons and there is no signature that they can contribute substantially to transporting heat .",
    "it can also be seen that the low - field behaviors of @xmath6 are a bit different for three different configurations of heat current vs field direction . for @xmath20 [ 111 ] , as shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) , the 0.36-k @xmath6 curve has two pronounced  dips \" at 1 and 3.25 t. with increasing temperature , they become more shallow and disappear above 1 k. for @xmath20 [ 110 ] ( or @xmath30 $ ] ) , as shown in figs .",
    "2(e ) and 2(f ) , the 0.36-k @xmath6 curves show two weak  dips \" , which are slightly different between @xmath31 [ 111 ] and @xmath31 [ 110 ] .",
    "in the former case , they locate at about 1 and 3.5 t , while in the latter case they locate at about 1 and 3 t ( the 1 t dip in fig .",
    "2(f ) is very weak ) .",
    "note that in these cases , the relative directions between the heat current and magnetic field are different , which yields some difference in the demagnetization effect . considering this factor , the positions of two dips depend on the direction of magnetic field rather than that of heat current .",
    "these two dips disappear quickly with increasing temperature .",
    "it should be noted that these low-@xmath5 @xmath6 isotherms do not display obvious hysteresis , which indicates that the possible magnetic domains@xcite are not coupled with the phonon transport . in this regard ,",
    "the @xmath6 results are not able to distinguish the order of phase transition at 6 t , which either a weak first - order transition or a second - order one were suggested by some earlier experimental results.@xcite    ti@xmath2o@xmath3 single crystals obtained from the specific - heat data for @xmath20 [ 110 ] and @xmath20 [ 111 ] .",
    "the characteristic fields of the @xmath6 curves are also plotted for the comparison .",
    "@xmath32 is the high - temperature paramagnetic state .",
    "the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and collinear states are three different phases mentioned in the main text.,width=226 ]    to probe the origin of the @xmath6 behaviors , we compare the characteristic fields , including the dips and step - like increase , with those transitions from the specific - heat data . in fig .",
    "3 , the @xmath33 phase diagrams of gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 for either @xmath20 [ 111 ] or @xmath20 [ 110 ] are determined by the transitions from the specific heat .",
    "they are nearly the same as those in some earlier literature.@xcite it is known that there are at least four different magnetic phases in the phase diagram , that is , the high-@xmath5 and high - field paramagnetic ( pm ) phase , the low-@xmath5 and low - field @xmath13 state , a lower - field @xmath12 state , and a higher - field collinear state ( see the introduction section ) .",
    "it is found that the characteristic fields from the @xmath6 data have a good correspondence with the phase boundaries among these four phases .",
    "the step - like increase of @xmath0 at about 6 t is caused by the transition from the low - field ordered state to the paramagnetic state.@xcite it can be explained as the elimination of the magnon scattering on phonons in a spin - polarized state .",
    "the dip of @xmath6 at about 3 t is caused by the transition from the @xmath13 state to the collinear state .",
    "it seems that this transition is a rearrangement of the spin structure , which is usually associated with the collapse of the spin anisotropy gap and the increased numbers of low - energy magnons .",
    "the phonon scattering is enhanced by a large number of magnons at the transition fields.@xcite another dip of @xmath0 at about 1 t , however , has no direct relationship to the specific - heat data . in the phase diagrams determined by the specific heat , this transition is locating deeply in the @xmath13 state . in this regard , it may be related to a very recent experimental finding of a new phase boundary at 1 t for @xmath20 [ 100].@xcite this boundary separates some unknown phases ( named as @xmath34 and @xmath35 in ref . ) from the @xmath13 state . since the phase diagrams of gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 are rather similar for different field directions,@xcite it is reasonable to believe that these newly found phases and phase boundaries exist also in the cases of @xmath20 [ 111 ] and @xmath20 [ 110 ] .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that the small differences in the critical fields between the @xmath6 data and the specific - heat data are probably due to either the uncertainty in defining the transition fields in two different physical properties or the difference in the demagnetization effect , or both .",

    "the peak is gradually suppressed and shifts to lower temperatures .",
    "it is not observable at temperatures down to 0.4 k with @xmath36 2 t. at the same time , a much broader peak emerges at about 1.3 k when @xmath39 1.5 t. it shifts to higher temperatures and becomes even broader with increasing field , which behaves like a schottky anomaly.@xcite all these are in good agreement with the previous results.@xcite in literatures , the specific heat of er@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 were studied for three different directions of magnetic field , that is , @xmath23 [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 111 ] , and were found to show some anisotropy of the transition fields between the ground state and the high - field quantum paramagnetic state . furthermore , the high - field specific heat were dependent on the field direction .",
    "in particular , the high - field humps or broad peaks in the [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] fields could be described by a simple two - level schottky anomaly , while those in the [ 111 ] fields could not.@xcite our present data confirmed this .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , the high - field data ( @xmath36 2 t ) are fitted using the following formula    @xmath40    where the first term represents the two - level schottky anomaly and the second one is the phonon contribution . here",
    ", @xmath4 is the universal gas constant , @xmath41 is a numerical coefficient , @xmath37 is the gap value and is dependent on the zeeman effect , and @xmath42 is the coefficient for low-@xmath5 phonon specific heat .",
    "it is found that this formula could qualitatively describe the data but the fittings are not perfect , which is very similar to the earlier study by sosin _",
    "et al._@xcite note that the parameters in our fittings , @xmath41 = 1.65 and @xmath42 = 2.8 @xmath43 j / k@xmath44mol , are also almost the same as those in ref . .",
    "all these indicate that for @xmath23 [ 111 ] , higher - field schottky - like peaks are not a simple behavior of paramagnetic moments . some soft modes related to the spin fluctuations",
    "are probably involved.@xcite    in a theoretical scenario , er@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 was found to have a ground state of quantum order by disorder and exhibit a quantum critical point at 1.52 t , where the long - range order is suppressed.@xcite however , the zero - field long - range order actually coexists with spin fluctuations , as revealed by the magnetic resonance spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite these soft spin excitations would not only contribute to the specific heat but also be easily coupled with low - energy phonons and significantly damp the phonon transport.@xcite across the quantum critical field ( 1.52 t ) , the magnetic excitations of ground state change drastically , which in principle could be detected by the thermal conductivity .",
    "figure 5 shows the temperature and magnetic - field dependencies of the thermal conductivity for different directions of heat current and magnetic field .",
    "both the @xmath28 curves and the low-@xmath5 @xmath6 isotherms show no obvious anisotropy .",
    "as far as the zero - field @xmath28 data are concerned , the phonon peaks locate at about @xmath45 k ; below about 1.2 k , as shown in the inset to fig .",
    "5(c ) , some slight changes in the slopes of these @xmath28 can be seen , which is related to the phase transition from the paramagnetic state to the long - range ordered state . with applying field of 1.5 or 2 t",
    ", the @xmath0 become much smaller than the zero - field data and the changes of the @xmath28 slopes at @xmath46 1.2 k are more significant . in a high field of 14 t ,",
    "the @xmath0 values are larger than the zero - field values at low temperatures , which indicates that in the spin - polarized state , the phonon scattering by magnetic excitations is quenched and the phonon transport is recovered . however ,",
    "at relatively higher temperatures , the @xmath0 in 14 t field is much smaller than the zero - field value , suggesting a field - induced magnetic scattering effect .",
    "this is different from the high-@xmath5 behavior of gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath6 isotherms show a dip - like behavior at low fields and an increase at high fields , particularly at very low temperatures . at the first glance , it is similar to that caused by paramagnetic scattering on phonons.@xcite but one may note a remarkable difference between the er@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 results and the paramagnetic scattering phenomenon . in the latter case ,",
    "the minimum or dip of the @xmath6 isotherm is due to a phonon resonant scattering by some magnetic excitations between the energy levels that are affected by the zeeman effect;@xcite therefore , the position of the dip should shift almost linearly with the magnetic field . for er@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , at higher temperatures ( @xmath47 1 k ) , the dip of @xmath0 becomes broader and shifts to higher fields with increasing temperature , which is indeed the same as the paramagnetic scattering effect .",
    "however , as can be seen in figs .",
    "5(d)-5(f ) , the dip fields are temperature independent for @xmath16 1 k. apparently , this sub - kelvin behavior must have some other origin .",
    "since the low-@xmath5 dip fields ( 1.5 or 2 t ) are close to the characteristic field in the specific heat , above which the @xmath38 peak was suppressed , it is likely that they correspond to the phase transition from the low - field ordered state to the high - field quantum paramagnetic state . in passing ,",
    "it should be pointed out that the dip field is essentially isotropic for different field directions , as shown by figs .",
    "5(d ) and 5(f ) , while the higher dip fields in fig .",
    "5(e ) could be due to the demagnetization effect .",

    "it is clear that the dips of @xmath6 have no good correspondence with the phase boundary of the af state , and at different temperature regions they have very different origins . at very low temperatures ( @xmath16 1 k )",
    ", the dips are coincided with the quantum critical field that suppresses the long - range - ordered ground state , which can be ascribed to be a simple explanation of the strong phonon scattering by the critical magnetic fluctuations .",
    "this is supported by a complete mode softening of spin excitations at @xmath49 as revealed by the inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite the higher - field enhancement of @xmath0 is due to the removal of low - lying magnetic excitations at @xmath50.@xcite on the other hand , the higher-@xmath5 ( @xmath51 1 k ) dips have a good correspondence with the higher - field schottky - like anomalies of the specific heat .",
    "although this anomaly was discussed to separate the ",

    "therefore , it is understandable that the @xmath6 behaviors at @xmath51 1 k match well with the phonon resonant scattering effect by the paramagnetic ions .",
    "both gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 and er@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 display the magnetic excitations scattering on phonons .",

    "dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 and ho@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , there is negligible scattering on phonons by the magnetic excitations in zero field.@xcite this is due to the fact that the peculiar magnetic excitations , magnetic monopoles , in the spin - ice compounds have sizeable energy gaps that prevent the thermal activations at very low temperatures.@xcite however , in magnetic fields the magnetic monopoles can be well populated and were found to scatter phonons rather strongly , particularly at the field - induced magnetic transitions between the  spin - ice \" , the  kagom - ice \" , and the  three - in - one - out \" states , although they might be able to transport heat also.@xcite in the quantum - spin - liquid material tb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , the coupling between spin fluctuations and phonons is so strong that the phonon heat transport exhibits a glassy - like behavior.@xcite in comparison , the coupling or scattering effect between magnetic excitations and phonons in the long - range ordered gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 and er@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 are not very strong but detectable at zero field .",
    "one reason that the magnetic excitations act mainly as phonon scatterers rather than heat carriers in @xmath1ti@xmath2o@xmath3 is apparently related to the rather weak exchange interactions in these materials . as a result ,",

    "larger phonon peak may indicate less structural imperfections in crystals .",
    "however , for magnetic materials , the magnetic scattering can play a role .",
    "this possibility seems to be supported by the details of the temperature dependence of @xmath0 . as can be seen in figs . 2 and 5 , near the long - range order transition in zero field",

    "third , gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 shows much more complicated @xmath6 behaviors than er@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "this is clearly due to a more complicated low-@xmath5 phase diagram of gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 . in present work",
    ", the low-@xmath5 heat transport of these materials again shows a close relationship to the magnetism and magnetic transitions , as also found in many other magnetic materials.@xcite it therefore provides a useful tool to probe some unknown magnetic transitions , as shown in fig .",
    "3 .    there are also some details remained to be further studied . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the temperature dependencies of @xmath0 of gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 show some clear deviations from the power low at sub - kelvin temperatures even in 14 t field . this may suggest that the magnetic scattering in the high - field spin - polarized state is still active at such low temperatures .",
    "this unusual temperature dependence points to some peculiarity of the high - field magnetic state of gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "one possible reason is that the ground state of gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 is a coexisting of long - range and short - ranges orders .",
    "the short - range order or spin fluctuations could survive in high field even when the long - range af order was suppressed .",
    "a supportive experimental result is that the magnetic resonance spectroscopy has detected some weakly dispersive soft modes in the spin - saturated phase , which could be explained based on the spin - wave calculations.@xcite",
    "thermal conductivities of pyrochlore @xmath1ti@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath4 = gd and er ) are studied at low temperatures down to 0.3 k and in high fields up to 14 t. it is found that the magnetic excitations play a role of scattering phonons rather than transporting heat , although these two materials have long - range magnetic orders at low temperatures . in gd@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3",
    ", the field - induced magnetic transitions can cause drastic changes of @xmath0 at the phase boundaries and lead to rather complicated field dependencies of @xmath0 .",
    "the main phenomena include the dip - like features in @xmath6 isotherms at the low - field phase transitions and a step - like increase of @xmath0 at the spin - polarization transition .",
    "er@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 shows much simpler field dependencies of @xmath0 , with a dip - like feature caused by the quantum phase transition at about 1.52 t or the paramagnetic phonon scattering at higher temperatures .",
    "these data demonstrate that heat transport is an effective means to probe the magnetic properties of pyrochlore rare - earth titanates .",
