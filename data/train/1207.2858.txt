    "the study of superheavy elements ( she s ) is an interesting topic for the current days research in nuclear physics .",
    "initially , the transuranium elements were made by subjecting uranium to a high neutron flux allowing to capture neutrons successively .",
    "the neutron - rich isotopes undergo @xmath2decay and produce new elements .",
    "this process allows to prepare element maximum upto fermion ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this is due to the shorter time interval of the spontaneous fission than neutron capture time of the newly form element . to make heavier",
    "@xmath4 nuclei one has to reach the so called _ island of stability _ which is a matter of discussion from last five decades @xcite .",
    "earlier , it was predicted @xcite that the next proton magic number beyond z=82 would be 126 considering the equality of the proton and neutron magic numbers for known closed shell nuclei .",
    "however , several microscopic calculations @xcite suggest a shift of this number to 114 .",
    "one of the cause of the shift is the coulomb effect on the spherical single particle levels .",
    "the use of shell correction by v. m. strutinsky @xcite to the liquid - drop calculation of binding energy ( be ) opens a more satisfactory exploration towards the search of double close nucleus beyond @xmath5pb . using this approach ,",
    "z=114 is supported to be the proton magic after 82 in refs.@xcite .",
    "based on the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) and skyrme hartree - fock ( shf ) calculations @xcite , it is predicted that the _ island of stability _ in the superheavy region is situated near mass number @xmath6 peaking at @xmath7120 .",
    "the main aim is to reach the _ stability island _ of superheavy valley using some alternative process rather than the nucleosynthesis by neutron capture .",
    "using cold fusion reaction , elements from @xmath8 are synthesized at gsi  @xcite which are based on pb and bi targets . at the production time of z = 112",
    "nucleus at gsi , the fusion cross section was extremely small ( 1 pb ) @xcite , which led to the conclusion that reaching still heavier elements will be very difficult by this process .",
    "the element z=113 was also synthesized in cold - fusion reaction at riken with a very low cross section @xmath9 pb @xcite confirming the limitation of cold - fusion synthesis .    to overcome this problem in hot fusion evaporation reactions with a deformed actinide targets and a neutron - rich doubly magic spherical projectile like @xmath10 are used in the synthesis of superheavy nuclei @xmath11 at dubna  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , although the synthesis of she s is a challenging task , the knowledge of their chemistry for the recently synthesized nuclei ( z=104 - 118 ) are more interesting to find the analogies between the properties of new elements and their lighter known neighbours in the groups of chemical elements and , eventually , proving their position in the periodic table .",
    "nowadays , the chemistry of some trans - actinide elements , like z=107 , 108 , 112 and 114 are known experimentally @xcite and theoretical efforts are also given @xcite .",
    "these elements are located at the bottom of the periodic table .",
    "these nuclei are extremely unstable and the electron shells are influenced by strong relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "the stability of a nucleus mostly depends on its structure which is again a function of the combination of neutrons and protons number . because of the large coulombic repulsion",
    ", the central portion of the nucleus may take a depletion and create a bubble like structure .",
    "there are some interesting and extensive calculations for various properties including bubbles or semi - bubbles structure of superheavy elements @xcite",
    ". however , theoretical predictions are in active discussion stage for the ground state structure of these double close nuclei z=114 , 120 or 126 and n=172 or 184 .",
    "for example , z. ren et al.@xcite predicted the nuclei have a well deformed ground state in rmf approach .",
    "of course a spherical degenerate state is also available in this calculations .",

    "are discussed by two well known self - consistent mean field models , namely skyrme hartree - fock ( shf ) using ski4 parameters @xcite with bcs pairing and relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model with nl3 * parameter set @xcite .",

    "for example , the neutron to proton ratio for @xmath5pb is 1.537 and for @xmath78u , these values are 1.554 and 1.587 , respectively . to see the overall n / z values of the synthesized isotopes in the superheavy region , we calculate the neutron to proton ratio for @xmath4=105 to 118 in addition to the predicted double close nuclei @xmath79120 .",
    "we find the minimum and maximum @xmath80 as 1.433 and 1.614 , respectively .",
    "one important quantity is the binding energy @xmath81 of a nucleus .",
    "the stability of a nucleus does not fully depend on the binding energy only .",
    "the arrangement of shells inside the nucleus is also a function of stability . in the absence of shell energy contribution ( liqiud - drop limit ) , it may be possible that a general view on stability of nuclei can be made on the basis of binding energy per particle @xmath82 , i.e. , nucleus is more stable with greater value of @xmath83 .",
    "binding energy is one of the experimental observable , which can be measured precisely and could be an important input for stability .",
    "generally , a nucleus is more stable with a larger binding energy per particle along an isotopic chain .",

    "it is clear that low mass nuclei in the vicinity of @xmath2stability valley have more life - time compare to the heavier isotopes .",
    "this may be due to the large coulomb repulsion of the superheavy nuclei , although the @xmath76 ratio is almost constant .",
    "the declining trend of @xmath83 indicates the difficulty in the formation of heavier superheavy nuclei .",
    "as we have mentioned , not only the be , but also the internal shell structure plays for the role of stability .",
    "thus , there is a bright chance for the formation of superheavy nucleus if a proper combination of n and z are selected which could be the next double close nucleus . in this context , it is to be recalled that the formation of a neutron - proton bound state system requires only 2.224 mev which is the typical binding energy of deuteron ( @xmath84 mev ) @xcite .    the binding energy per nucleon @xmath82 is compared with the frdm data .",

    "the well known ski4@xcite and nl3*@xcite parametrizations are used through out the shf and rmf calculations , respectively . it is to be noted that the maximum binding energy corresponds to the ground state and all other solutions are the intrinsic excited state configurations . considering this criteria",
    ", we evaluate the ground state binding energy and also the first and second excited states wherever available .",
    "the results obtained from shf are listed in table i and those for rmf are listed in table ii .",
    "since the experimental binding energy of these nuclei are not known , to get a first hand information about the predictive power of our calculations , we have inserted the most commonly used binding energy of finite range droplet model ( frdm ) @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath75 obtained in frdm is also given for comparison @xcite .",
    "comparing tables i and ii , it is remarkable to note that the binding energy obtained by shf(ski4 ) and rmf(nl3 * ) are quite agreeable with frdm prediction .",

    "this phenomenon is more common in superheavy region , leads to complex structure of these nuclei which provides the information about the oscillation of nuclei between two or three existing shape by perturbing small energy . here",
    ", in our studied nuclei , we find many such examples , where the ground and first excited binding energies are degenerated .",
    "also , in several cases the nuclei have well defined three distinct solutions ( oblate , spherical , prolate ) with almost same energy which strongly indicates the nuclei may oscillate from oblate to spherical to prolate configuration .    for analyzing the result",
    ", we took a small binding energy difference around @xmath87 2 mev to take care of shape co - existence for our calculations .",
    "because of this small difference in binding energies between these two solutions , the ground state can be changed to the low - lying excited state or vice - versa by a small change in input parameters like pairing gaps etc .",
