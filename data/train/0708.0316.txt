    "bl  lac objects are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) characterized by strong and varying polarization at ultraviolet through radio wavelengths , which are observationally similar to radio - loud quasars in many respects , but display systematically weaker optical line emission .",
    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) polarization observations of bl lac objects have shown a tendency for the magnetic ( b ) fields in their jets to be perpendicular to the local jet direction ( gabuzda et al 2000 ) .",
    "it seems likely that many of these transverse b fields represent the ordered toroidal component of the intrinsic b fields of the jets , as discussed by gabuzda ( 2007 ) , see also references therein .",
    "faraday rotation of the plane of linear polarization occurs during the passage of an electromagnetic wave through a region with free electrons and a magnetic field with a non - zero component along the line - of - sight , and is due to the difference in the propagation velocities of the right and left - circularly polarized components of the wave .",
    "the amount of rotation is proportional to the density of free electrons @xmath0 multiplied by the line - of - sight magnetic field @xmath1 , the square of the observing wavelength @xmath2 , and various physical constants ; the coefficient of @xmath2 is called the rotation measure ( rm ) :    @xmath3    systematic gradients in the faraday rotation have been observed across the parsec - scale jets of several agns , interpreted as reflecting the systematic change in the line - of - sight component of a toroidal or helical jet b field across the jet ( blandford 1993 ; asada et al .",
    "2002 ; gabuzda , murray & cronin 2004 ) .",
    "such fields would come about in a natural way as a result of the ` winding up ' of an initial ` seed ' field by the rotation of the central accreting objects ( e.g. nakamura , uchida & hirose 2001 : lovelace et al .",
    "determining how widespread this phenomenon is will be crucial for our understanding of agn jets .",
    "polarization observations of 37 bl lac objects were obtained using the 10 25-m radio telescopes of the vlba , at two wavelengths near the 2 cm , 3.6 cm and 6 cm bands ( a total of 6 wavelengths ) .",
    "the data were obtained over 5 epochs ( 22 august 2003 , 22 march 2004 , 12 april 2004 , 11 august 2004 and 2 september 2004 ) , with 8 - 10 sources observed per epoch .",
    "the data were calibrated and imaged in the nrao aips package using standard techniques .",
    "the uncertainties in the polarization angles shown take into account the rms noise in the stokes q and u maps and the uncertainty in the angle calibration .",
    "results for nine of the bl lac objects in which we have detected transverse rm gradients are presented here ( figs . 1 - 5 ) .",
    "after matching the imaging parameters and beam sizes of the final images at all the wavelengths , we constructed maps of the rm , after first subtracting the effect of the integrated rm ( presumed to arise in our galaxy ) from the observed polarization angles ( rusk 1988 : pushkarev 2001 ) .",
    "total - intensity contours with superimposed rm distributions and plots of polarization angle ( @xmath4 ) versus wavelength ( @xmath5 ) squared are shown ( figs . 1 - 3 ) .",
    "we observe an extended rm gradient in the jet of 0820 + 225 ( fig .",
    "4 ) ; gabuzda , murray and cronin ( 2004 ) also observed a gradient in the jet of this source , but somewhat closer to the core , possibly suggesting that the electron - density distribution has changed between our observations .",
    "the transverse rm gradients in the jets of 0003 - 066 , 0256 + 075 , 0716 + 714 , 0735 + 178 , 0954 + 658 , 1156 + 295 and 2155 - 152 were detected by us for the first time .",
    "the gradient in 1749 + 096 ( fig .",
    "3 ) is visible in the rm map of zavala and taylor ( 2004 ) ; the gradient in 0954 + 658 ( fig .",
    "4 ) is confirmed by o sullivan & gabuzda , these proceedings .",
    "we also observe a reversal of the gradient in the core regions as compared to the jets in 0716 + 714 and 2155 - 152 ( fig .",
    "5 ) . see mahmud et al , these proceedings , for an example of a source showing reversal of the gradient in the jet over time .",

    "the presence of transverse rm gradients has been confirmed for the jets of 0820 + 225 ( gabuzda , murray & cronin 2004 ) and 1749 + 096 ( zavala & taylor 2004 ) , and new transverse rm gradients have been detected in the jets of seven other objects .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that this is a fairly widespread phenomenon which , in turn , suggests that helical b fields are common in agn jets .",
    "furthermore , we find evidence for evolution in the rm distribution in 0820 + 225 .",
    "the ` spine - sheath ' polarization structure ( transverse magnetic field vectors in the central jet region , with longitudinal magnetic field vectors hugging the edges of the jet ) in 1156 + 295 is consistent with this jet having a helical magnetic field ( lyutikov et al 2005 ) .",
    "our observations have also revealed new features not previously observed , such as reversals in these gradients with distance from the core ( fig .",
    "5 ) and with time ( mahmud et al , these proceedings ) .",
    "the mechanisms behind these phenomena are not yet fully understood but may provide information about the intrinsic magnetic field configuration that is ` wound up ' by the rotation of the central black hole .",
