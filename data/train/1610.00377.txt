    "remarkably this `` probabilistic spin logic '' or psl can also be used to implement the inverse function with multiple solutions which are all visited with equal probability .    any random signal generator",
    "whose randomness can be tuned with a third terminal should be a suitable building block for the kind of probabilistic spin logic ( psl ) proposed in this paper .",
    "the icon in fig.1b represents our generic building block whose input @xmath3 controls the output @xmath4 according to the equation ( fig.1a ) @xmath5    where rand(@xmath11,+1 ) represents a random number uniformly distributed between @xmath11 and + 1 , and @xmath6 is assumed large enough that memory of past history has been lost .",
    "if the input is zero , the output takes on a value of @xmath11 or + 1 with equal probability , as shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fi : fig1 ] . a negative input",
    "@xmath3 makes negative values more likely ( left panel ) while a positive input makes positive values more likely ( right panel ) .",
    "[ fi : fig1]c shows @xmath7 as the input is ramped from negative to positive values . also shown is the time - averaged value of @xmath4 which equals @xmath8",
    ".        a possible physical implementation of p - bits could use stochastic nanomagnets with low energy barriers @xmath9 whose retention time @xcite : @xmath10 is very small , of the order of @xmath11 which is a material dependent quantity called the attempt time and is experimentally found to be @xmath12 @xcite among different magnetic materials .",
    "such stochastic nanomagnets can be pinned to a given direction with spin - currents @xmath13 that are a factor of 40 less than those needed to switch 40 kt magnets .",
    "we have performed detailed simulation of such magnets using the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( s - llg ) equation for both perpendicular ( pma ) and in - plane ( i m a ) low barrier nanomagnets and the results are in good agreement with those presented in this paper using the simple generic model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmoid ] ) .",
    "these magnet - specific results will be presented separately @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all results in this paper are based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmoid ] ) in order to emphasize the generality of the concept of p - bits which need not necessarily be nanomagnet - based @xcite .",
    "the sigmoidal tuning curve in fig.1c represents the essence of a p - bit , and it seems like a natural feature of nanomagnets driven by spin currents , but it is not too different from those discussed in the context of cmos @xcite .    to ensure that individual p - bits can be interconnected to produce robust correlations , it is also important to have separate terminals marked w and r for writing ( more correctly for biasing ) and for reading as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : fig1]b . with i",
    "m a nanomagnets this could be accomplished following existing experiments @xcite using the giant spin hall effect ( gshe ) .",
    "recent experiments using a built - in exchange bias @xcite could make this approach applicable to pma as well .",
    "note , however , that these experiments have all been performed with stable free layers , and have to be carried out with low barrier magnets in order to establish their suitability for the implementation of p - bits .",
    "as the field progresses , one can expect the bias terminal to involve voltage control instead of current control , just as the output could invove quatities other than magnetization .        _ ensemble - average versus time - average : _ a sigmoidal response was presented in @xcite for the ensemble - averaged magnetization of large barrier magnets biased along a neutral state . this",
    "was proposed as a building block for both ising computers and directed belief networks and a recent preprint @xcite describes a similar approach applied to a graph coloring problem .",
    "by contrast low barrier nanomagnets provide a sigmoidal response for the time - averaged magnetization and a suitably engineered network of such nanomagnets cycle through the @xmath14 collective states at ghz rates , with an emphasis on the `` low energy states '' which can encode the solution to the combinatorial optimization problems , like the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) as shown in @xcite .",
    "once the time - varying magnetization has been converted into a time - varying voltage through a read circuit , a simple rc circuit can be used to extract the answer through a moving time average .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fi : fig1]c the red trace was obtained from the rapidly varying blue trace using an rc circuit in a spice simulation .",
    "the central feature underlying both implementations is the _ p - bit _ that acts like a tunable random number generator , providing an intrinsic sigmoidal response for the ensemble - averaged or the time - averaged magnetization as a function of the spin current .",
    "it is this response that allows us to _ correlate _ the fluctuations of different p - bits in a useful manner by interconnecting them according to @xmath15 where @xmath16 provides a local bias to magnet @xmath17 and @xmath18 defines the effect of bit j to bit i , and @xmath19 sets a global scale for the strength of the interactions like an inverse `` pseudo - temperature '' .",
    "equations ( [ eq : sigmoid]-[eq : weight ] ) are essentially the same as the defining equations for boltzmann machines introduced by hinton and his collaborators @xcite which have had enormous impact in the field of machine learning , but they are usually implemented in software that is run on standard cmos hardware .",
    "equation ( [ eq : sigmoid ] ) arises naturally from the physics of low barrier nanomagnets as we have discussed above .",
    "equation ( [ eq : weight ] ) represents the `` weight logic '' for which there are many candidates such as memristors @xcite , floating - gate based devices @xcite , domain - wall based devices @xcite , standard cmos @xcite .",
    "the suitability of these options will depend on the range of j values and the sparsity of the j - matrix .",
    "_ outline of paper : _ the objective of this paper is to show that p - bits can provide the building block for a probabilistic spin logic ( psl ) framework that is suitable not just for heuristic non - boolean logic but _ even for precise boolean logic _ by implementing relatively small gates as bidirectional boltzmann machines ( bm @xcite , fig .",
    "[ fi : fig2]a ) which are then interconnected in a directed fashion to implement complex functionalities ( fig .",
    "[ fi : fig2]b ) .    in section ii we will briefly describe how a given truth table can be implemented reliably and reconfigurably ( fig .",
    "[ fi : fig3 ] ) using bidirectional networks of p - bits for which we can define an energy functional @xmath20    such that the boltzmann law accurately describes the long - time average of the individual probabilities for the interconnected network to be in different states : @xmath21    fig .",
    "[ fi : fig4 ] shows the close agreement between the probabilities obtained from a direct numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmoid]@xmath1[eq : weight ] ) over long times and those obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bl ] ) for an and gate , consistent with its designation as a bm .",
    "unlike standard transistor - based implementations , these bms are reversible like the memcomputers proposed in @xcite .",
    "they not only implement boolean functions providing the correct output for a given input , but also the _ inverse function _ providing the correct input(s ) for a given output , thus providing solutions to the boolean satisfiability problem ( fig .",
    "[ fi : fig5 ] ) .    in section iii",
    "we show that full adders implemented as bms can be interconnected to implement relatively large logic operations like 32-bit adders .",
    "this is particularly surprising since we do not expect a large collection of stochastic units to get correlated precisely enough to converge on the one correct answer out of @xmath2 possibilities !",
    "note that the 32-bit adder is not fully bidirectional , even though it comprises full adders that are individually bidirectional .",
    "the carry bits connect unidirectionally from the less significant to the more significant bit as dictated by the logic of addition .",
    "interestingly , despite this deviation from complete bidirectionality , the overall adder seems to work in reverse : when we fix the sum bits and let the input bits `` float '' , the input bits fluctuate randomly , but in a correlated manner such that their sum is always precisely equal to the fixed sum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : fig7 ] .    finally ,",
    "by combining individual full adders ( fa ) and and gates as a directed network of bms , we construct a 4-bit multiplier that performs integer factorization ( fig .",
    "[ fi : fig8 ] ) when operated in reverse similar to memcomputing @xcite based on deterministic memristors . note , however , that the building blocks and operating principles of stochastic p - bits and memcomputing are very different .",
    ") which ensures that the truth table corresponds to the low energy states of the boltzmann machines according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bl ] ) .",
    "a handle bit of + 1 is introduced to each line of the truth table which can be biased to ensure that the complementary truth table does not appear along with the desired one .",
    "this bit also allows a truth table to be electrically reconfigured into its complement . ]",
    "we now present examples showing how any given truth table can be implemented reliably using boltzmann machines .",
    "our approach , pictorially described in fig .",
    "[ fi : fig3 ] , begins by transforming a given truth table from binary @xmath22 to bipolar @xmath23 variables .",
    "the lines of the truth table are then required to be eigenvectors each with eigenvalue + 1 , all other eigenvectors are assumed to have 0 eigenvalues .",
    "this leads to following prescription for j as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : fig3 ] :    @xmath24 = \\sum_{i , j}\\mathrm{[s^{-1}]_{ij } u_i u_j^\\dagger}\\\\ \\label{eq : amit } \\rm s_{ij }    = u_i^\\dagger u_j \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 are the eigenvectors corresponding to lines in the truth table of a boolean operation and s is a projection matrix that accounts for the non - orthogonality of the vectors defined by different lines of the truth table .",
    "note that the resultant j - matrix is always symmetric ( @xmath26 ) with diagonal terms that are subtracted in our models such that @xmath27 .",
    "the number of p - bits in the system is made greater than the number of lines in a truth table through the addition of hidden layers ( fig .",
    "[ fi : fig3 ] ) to ensure that the number of conditions we impose is less than the dimension of the space defined by the number of p - bits .",
    "another important aspect is that an eigenvector @xmath28 implies that its complement @xmath29 is also a valid eigenvector .",
    "however only one of these might belong to a truth table .",
    "we introduce a `` handle '' bit to each @xmath28 that is biased @xmath30 to distinguish complementary eigenvectors .",
    "these handle bits provide the added benefit of reconfigurability .",
    "for example , and and or gates have complementary truth tables , and a given gate can be electrically reconfigured as an and or an or gate using the handle bit .    note that this prescription for [ j ] is based on the principles developed originally for hopfield networks ( @xcite , and eq .",
    "( 4.20 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "however , other approaches are possible along the lines described in the context of ising hamiltonians for quantum computers @xcite .",
    "we have tried some of these other designs for [ j ] and many of them lead to results similar to those presented here . for practical implementations , it will be important to evaluate different approaches in terms of their demands on the dynamic range and accuracy of the weight logic .",
    "once a j - matrix and the h - vector are obtained for a given problem , the system is initialized by randomizing all @xmath4 at time , @xmath31 .",
    "first , the current ( voltage ) that a given p - bit ( @xmath4 ) feels due to all the other @xmath32 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : weight ] ) , and the @xmath4 value is updated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmoid ] ) . next the procedure",
    "is repeated for the remaining p - bits by finding the current they feel due to all other @xmath4 using the _ updated _ values of @xmath4 .",
    "for this reason , the order of updating was chosen randomly in our models and we found that the order of updating has no effect in our results .",
    "this is similar to the `` asynchronous '' updating of hopfield networks @xcite .",
    "[ fi : fig4 ] shows the time evolution of an and gate designed as outlined in fig .",
    "[ fi : fig3 ] with a total of 8 p - bits comprising 5-auxiliary bits in addition to the 3 input / output bits of an and gate .",
    "initially for @xmath33 the interaction strength @xmath34 , making the pseudo - temperature of the system infinite , and the network produces uncorrelated noise , visiting each state with equal probability . in the second phase ( @xmath35 ) , the interaction strength is suddenly increased to @xmath36 , effectively `` quenching '' the network by reducing the temperature .",
    "this correlates the system such that only the states corresponding to the truth table of the and gate are visited , each with equal probability when a long time average is taken .",
    "the average probabilities in each phase are reproduced quantitatively by the boltzmann law defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bl ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fi : fig5 ] , we show how a correlated network that produces a given truth table can be used to do directed computation analogous to standard cmos logic . by `` clamping '' the input bits of an or gate ( @xmath33 ) through their bias terminals , @xmath16 to ( a , b)=(+1,+1 ) ,",
    "the system is forced to only one of the peaks of the truth table , effectively making c=1 .",
    "the psl gates however exhibit a remarkable difference with standard logic gates , in that inputs and outputs are on an equal footing .",
    "not only do clamped inputs give the corresponding output , _ a clamped output gives the corresponding input(s ) .",
    "_ in the second phase ( @xmath35 ) the output of the or gate is clamped to + 1 , that produces three possible peaks for the input terminals , corresponding to various possible input combinations that are consistent with the clamped output ( a , b)=(0,1),(1,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) .",
    "the probabilistic nature of psl allows it to obtain multiple solutions at the same time ( fig .",
    "[ fi : fig5]c )",
    ". it also seems to make the results more resilient to _ unwanted _ noise due to `` stray fields '' that are inevitable in physical implementations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : fig6 ] .        ) as indicated in the figure .",
    "the noise is assumed to be uniformly distributed over all p - bits in a given network , and centered around zero with magnitude @xmath37 .",
    "each gate is simulated 50,000 times for t=100 time steps to produce an error probability for a given noise value , and the maximum peak produced by the system is assumed to be an output that can be read with certainty .",
    "the system shows robust behavior even in the presence of large levels of noise . ]",
    "when constructing larger circuits composed of individual boltzmann machines , the reciprocal nature of the boltzmann machine often interferes with the directed nature of computation that is desired .",
    "it seems advisable to use a hybrid approach .",
    "for example in constructing a 32-bit adder we use full - adders ( fa ) that are individually bms with symmetric connections , @xmath38 .",
    "but when connecting the carry bit from one fa to the next , the coupling element @xmath18 is non - zero in only one direction from the less significant to the more significant bit .",
    "this directed coupling between the components distinguishes psl from purely reciprocal boltzmann machines . indeed",
    "even the full adder could be implemented not as a boltzmann machine but as a directed network of more basic gates .",
    "_ adder : _ fig .",
    "[ fi : fig7 ] shows the operation of a 32-bit adder that sums two 32-bit numbers a and b to calculate the 33-bit sum s. in the initial phase ( @xmath39 ) we have @xmath34 corresponding to infinite temperature so that the system fluctuates among @xmath40 8 billion possibilities . at @xmath31",
    "we increase @xmath19 to 70 , and the system unerringly settles down to the one unique solution within 10 to 15 time steps , as we have observed in many different runs , even while adding two binary numbers that propagates a carry all the way from the first bit to the 32@xmath41 bit , as in this example .",
    "interestingly , although the overall system includes several unidirectional connections , it seems to be able to perform the inverse function as well . with",
    "a and b clamped it calculates s = a+b as noted above .",
    "conversely with s clamped , the input bits a and b fluctuate in a correlated manner so as to make their sum sharply peaked around s ! fig .",
    "[ fi : fig7 ] shows the time evolution of the input bits that have broad distributions spanning a wide range .",
    "their sum too shows a broad distribution for @xmath39 when @xmath42 , but once @xmath19 steps up at @xmath31 the distributions of a and b get strongly correlated making the distribution of a+b sharply peaked around the fixed value of s.    _ factorizer : _ fig .",
    "[ fi : fig8 ] shows how the reversibility of psl logic blocks can be used to perform integer factorization using a multiplier in reverse similar to memcomputing devices @xcite .",
    "normally , the factorization problem requires specific algorithms and hardware @xcite to be performed in cmos - like hardware , but here we simply use a digital 4-bit multiplier working in _ reverse _ to achieve this operation , which would not be possible in standard cmos implementations .    specifically with the output of the multiplier clamped to a given integer from 0 to 15",
    ", the input bits float to the correct factors . as with other examples ,",
    "the interconnection strength @xmath19 is stepped up from zero at @xmath31 .",
    "if the output is set to 9 , both inputs float to 3 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : fig8]b . with the output set to 6",
    ", both inputs fluctuate between two values , 2 and 3 .",
    "note that factors like @xmath43 do not show up , since encoding 9 in binary requires 4-bits ( 1001 ) and the input terminals only have 2-bits .",
    "we have checked other cases where factorizing 3 shows both @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and factorizing zero shows all possible peaks since there are many solutions such that @xmath46 and so on .",
    "we also kept the same directed connections between the full adders for the carry bits , making them a directed network of boltzmann machines , similar to the 32-bit adder .",
    "moreover , we kept a directed connection _ from _ the full adders _ to _ the and gates as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : fig8]a since the information needs to flow from the output to the input in the case of factorization .",
    "the input bits that go to multiple and gates are `` tied '' to each other with a positive exchange ( @xmath47 ) value much like 2-spins interacting ferromagnetically , however in psl we envision these interactions to be controlled purely electrically .",
    "we have presented a framework for using probabilistic units or p - bits as a building block for deterministic computation by establishing robust correlations among them .",
    "this requires the randomness of individual units to be tunable with an input signal , with a clear separation of input and output terminals as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : fig1 ] .",
    "low barrier nanomagnets driven by spin currents generated through the spin hall effect could be used to provide a physical realization of a p - bit , but this is only one of many possibilities . to emphasize this generality we use a generic hardware - agnostic model defined by eqs .",
