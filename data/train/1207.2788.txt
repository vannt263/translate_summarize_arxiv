    "<S> we study the time scales associated to diffusion processes that take place on multiplex networks , i.e.  on a set of networks linked through interconnected layers . to this end , we propose the construction of a supra - laplacian matrix , which consists of a dimensional lifting of the laplacian matrix of each layer of the multiplex network . </S>",
    "<S> we use perturbative analysis to reveal analytically the structure of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the complete network in terms of the spectral properties of the individual layers . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the supra - laplacian allows us to understand the physics of diffusion - like processes on top of multiplex networks .    </S>",
    "<S> modern theory of complex networks is facing new challenges that arise from the necessity of understanding properly the dynamical evolution of real systems . </S>",
    "<S> one of such open problems concerns the topological and dynamical characterization of systems made up by two or more interconnected networks . </S>",
    "<S> the standard approach in network modeling assumes that every edge ( link ) is of the same type and consequently considered at the same temporal and topological scale @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .     layers . </S>",
    "<S> nodes are the same in both layers . </S>",
    "<S> the connectivity at each layer is independent of each other , the connectivity inter - layer is from each node to itself ( dashed links).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    this is clearly an abstraction of any real topological structure and represents either instantaneous or aggregated interactions over a certain time window . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to understand the intricate variability of real complex systems , where many different time scales and structural patterns coexist we need a new scenario , a new level of description @xcite .    a natural extension which allows to overcome previous drawbacks </S>",
    "<S> is to describe a multilevel system as a set of coupled layered networks ( _ multiplex _ network ) where each layer could have very particular features different from the rest , and in this way , define a richer structure of interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multiplex networks are thus structured multilevel graphs in which interconnections between layers determine how a given node in a layer and its counterpart in another layer are linked and influence each other . </S>",
    "<S> thus , they are essentially different from simple graphs with colored edges , multi graphs or hypergraphs and provide a mathematical ground for the analysis of many social networks ( e.g.  facebook , twitter , etc ) and of several biological systems @xmath0 for instance , in biochemical networks , many different signaling channels do actually work in parallel , giving raise to what is called multitasking , which can be modeled through a network of interconnected layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although some works have recently focused on the description and analysis of interconnected networks @xcite , theoretically grounded results about general dynamical processes running on them are yet to come .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a particular setup of multilevel networks in which nodes are conserved through the different layers of the multiplex ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multiplex ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the current study analyzes a diffusion process that takes place at the whole system level , i.e.  within and across layers . </S>",
    "<S> this setup could account , for instance , for a diffusion dynamics taking place on top of a social network of contacts . </S>",
    "<S> admittedly , the latter is a network of networks , i.e.  the aggregate of many different social circles or subnetworks , each having its own temporal or structural patterns ( for example , think of our online activity which includes different social networking sites such as facebook , twitter , etc . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the same applies to multimodal transportation networks @xcite , on top of which individuals `` diffuse '' within and between different layers ( e.g.  bus , subway , etc . ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us remark , however , that our interest here is not to solve a specific real problem but to illustrate the analysis of diffusion processes on top of these structures .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose a mathematical setting that allows to scrutinize the emergent diffusion time scales in multiplex networks . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on diffusive processes , as they constitute a good approximation for different types of dynamical processes ( e.g.  synchronization and other nonlinear processes amenable of linearization @xcite ) whose dynamical properties can be captured by the behavior of the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the time needed to synchronize phase oscillators in a network is related to the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian , @xmath1 @xcite , and the stability of the synchronized state is determined by the eigenratio @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral analysis of complex networks constitutes then still a promising area of research @xcite . following a perturbative analysis of the spectra @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> our results allow to get new physical insight about diffusion processes through the analytical determination of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of the laplacian of the multiplex ( supra - laplacian ) when the diffusive coupling between layers is either small or large . </S>",
    "<S> our findings prove that the emergent physical behavior of the diffusion process when considering coupled layered networks is far from trivial , in some cases ( specified below ) the coupling of networks shows a super - diffusive behavior meaning that diffusive processes in the multiplex are faster than in any of the networks that form it separately .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a set up in which the diffusive dynamics is linearly coupled within nodes in each layer @xmath3 , through a diffusion constant @xmath4 , and among nodes in different layers @xmath3 and @xmath5 , in this case with a diffusion constant @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the network at each layer is assumed to be connected and undirected , but it can be weighted . </S>",
    "<S> the state of each of the @xmath7 nodes is represented as a vector indexed by layers @xmath8 where the subscript stands for the node and the superscript for the layer . </S>",
    "<S> the equations describing the dynamical evolution of the states of the nodes , considering a multiplex of the @xmath9 layers , are : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the weight matrix at layer @xmath3 ( @xmath12 means that there is no link between nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 in layer @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this set of equations can be dimensionally lifted to a space of @xmath15 dimensions . to have a more clear picture of our formalism we will consider , without loss of generalization , the most simple case of two layers @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> first , we define a column vector state of @xmath17 elements , @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> then eq .  ( [ ori ] ) can be written in matrix form , where the interaction matrix has a block structure that conforms an object we call supra - laplacian @xmath19 , with the same properties that any zero - sum rows laplacian has : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the respective laplacians of each layer , and @xmath23 is the identity matrix . </S>",
    "<S> here we have replaced @xmath24 by @xmath25 to emphasize the role of the diffusion process among the same node at different layers . </S>",
    "<S> the laplacian matrix of each layer @xmath3 is just @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the weights matrix at layer @xmath3 , and @xmath28 a diagonal matrix containing the strength of each node @xmath13 at layer @xmath3 , @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the diagonal block structure of the supra - laplacian reflects the interaction within layers and the off - diagonal blocks the connectivity between layers .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical properties of the system can then be cast in terms of the eigenvalues of this matrix . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ori ] ) can be written as @xmath30 and , given that @xmath31 is symmetric , its solution in terms of normal modes is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the eigenvalues of @xmath31 , see e.g.  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion time scale @xmath34 of the multiplex is controlled by the smallest non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , @xmath35 . to get a physical insight on these eigenvalues as a function of the different diffusion coefficients within layers ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) and between layers ( @xmath25 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we propose to analyze the whole system using perturbation theory . to simplify the notation </S>",
    "<S> , we choose the diffusion coefficients @xmath38 fixing then the relative time scale of the problem .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the decomposition @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the block diagonal matrix corresponding to the laplacians of every layer , with zeros in the off - diagonal blocks , and @xmath41 is formed by the rest of the elements . in matrix form </S>",
    "<S> it reads : @xmath42 let us start the discussion by considering @xmath43 . then , the eigenvalues of @xmath19 are the set formed by the union of the eigenvalues corresponding to the laplacians of each layer @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , while the eigenvalues of the supra - laplacian matrix are @xmath46 , being @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that to analyze the eigenvector space it is convenient to move to a new basis where the space corresponding to @xmath48 is spanned by vectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 instead of the canonical @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us consider that the diffusion between layers is different from zero , @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , the supra - laplacian will have the trivial eigenvalue @xmath54 with corresponding eigenvector @xmath49 , and a non - trivial eigenvalue @xmath55 that corresponds exactly to the eigenvector @xmath50 , since @xmath56 note that this eigenvalue always exists , but it will be the smallest non - zero one only when @xmath25 is very small , as compared to @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we focus our attention on the opposite limit , a very large diffusion coefficient the model ( [ ori ] ) does not hold and the whole multiplex can be understood as a single projected network with a unique state per node ] between layers @xmath57 . defining @xmath58 , we can write @xmath59 = d_x{\\tilde{\\cal l}}. \\label{cinco}\\ ] ] the spectrum of @xmath60 is considered here a perturbation of that at @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth recalling that , for @xmath61 , the spectrum corresponds to that of the coupling matrix @xmath62 which consists of two eigenvalues @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) both @xmath7-degenerate and spanned by eigenvectors of the form @xmath65 and @xmath66 , i.e.  vectors having identical or opposite values in the @xmath67 and @xmath68 components , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the limit @xmath69 , the set of eigenvalues of @xmath19 will split in two groups , one showing a linear divergent behavior @xmath70 for the sub - space @xmath66 , and another having a finite value @xmath71 as the result of the undetermined limit ( @xmath72 ) in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cinco ] ) for the sub - space @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we use the common ansatz in perturbation theory and propose a perturbed solution in terms of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors : @xmath73 where the super - indices within parentheses represent the order of the perturbation @xcite . given that a set of eigenvalues of @xmath19 will diverge linearly as @xmath74 , we concentrate in proposing perturbations for the finite solutions . these correspond to consider the following perturbation of the eigenspectrum of @xmath60 : @xmath75 expanding to @xmath76 the eigenvalue problem @xmath77 we obtain : @xmath78 matching each of the components in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq8 ] ) we get : @xmath79 that , after adding and subtracting eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dos ] ) , transform into : @xmath80    from the system of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ resta ] ) it is revealed that @xmath81 is an eigenvector of the network formed by the superposition of both layers laplacians , and that the eigenvalue of @xmath19 , at first order in the expansion , is @xmath82 being @xmath83 the eigenvalue of the superposition @xmath84 corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , given that the vector perturbation in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pert ] ) must be orthogonal @xmath85 , we can also find the eigenvector of the superposition @xmath84 such that @xmath86 , then @xmath87    summarizing , the eigenvectors with finite ( i.e.  non divergent ) eigenvalues of the supra - laplacian @xmath19 for a large value of the diffusion coefficient @xmath58 between layers are @xmath88 being @xmath89 and @xmath83 the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues of the superposition @xmath84 .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical insight obtained is the following , for low values of the diffusion coefficient between layers , the diffusion time scale of the global system is controlled by the inverse of @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this asymptotic result is valid until the order of @xmath25 is similar to those of @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for large values of @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> the eigenspectrum splits into a set of values that diverges as @xmath74 , and a set of finite values , associated to the superposition of the layers . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal eigenvalue different from zero turns out to be half the eigenvalue corresponding to the superposition of both layers @xmath90 .    a comparison between the diffusion time scale of the independent layers and the whole multiplex is possible using known bounds about the eigenvalues of the laplacians @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time scale associated to the multiplex for @xmath91 is @xmath92 that means that the cross - diffusion between layers is the limiting value of the diffusion spreading . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the time scale associated to the multiplex for @xmath93 is @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> this latter case is far less trivial than the previous one . using the bounds in @xcite we deduce the following result : @xmath95 the above inequality implies that the diffusion in the multiplex will be faster than the diffusion in the slowest layer . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as a consequence of the multiplex structure , at least one layer ( the one with the largest diffusion time scale ) has its diffusion speeded up . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of a super - diffussion , i.e.  the fact that the time scale of the multiplex is faster than that of both layers acting separately is , in general , not guaranteed and depends on the specific structures coupled together . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the following inequality also holds @xcite : @xmath96 being @xmath97 the strength of node @xmath13 at layer @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is worth noticing that although the previous analysis assumes that the networks within layers are connected , we have also analyzed the case in which this hypothesis is relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> imagine for example two layers such as one layer has two disconnected components . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , the results hold in the limit @xmath93 , and in the limit @xmath98 the lowest ( different from zero ) eigenvalue scales as @xmath99 , with @xmath100 although the perturbed eigenvector is far more intricate .    to illustrate our results , we have computed the evolution of the eigenvalues of the supra - laplacian for the example represented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multiplex ] , which corresponds to two random networks of @xmath101 nodes . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rand6 ] ( top ) we plot the eigenvalues as a function of the diffusion coefficient @xmath25 .    c   as a function of the coupling @xmath25 ( top ) for @xmath38 , and comparison between the second smallest eigenvalues @xmath1 of the different laplacians ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +   +   as a function of the coupling @xmath25 ( top ) for @xmath38 , and comparison between the second smallest eigenvalues @xmath1 of the different laplacians ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we observe the splitting of the eigenvalues into two groups , divergent and finite values , as predicted . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rand6 ] ( bottom ) shows the theoretical estimates for @xmath1 in the asymptotic limits @xmath91 and @xmath102 . note that , except for the intermediate zone ( @xmath103 ) , where the analysis does not hold , the agreement is excellent . in this panel </S>",
    "<S> we have represented , as indicated in the legend , the eigenvalues of each layer , the eigenvalue of the superposition of both layers and the line corresponding to @xmath74 as well as the eigenvalue of the supra - laplacian . </S>",
    "<S> the results undoubtedly confirm that both theoretical limits ( small and large @xmath25 ) are correctly identified by the analytical derivations . </S>",
    "<S> note that the model allows switch on and off the consideration of isolated layers or the whole multiplex , simply by putting @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> for the example exposed , we observe a super - diffusion process for the whole multiplex , that means that the time scale associated to the whole multiplex network is smaller than that of layer 1 and layer 2 if they were considered independently , i.e.  @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> other examples comparing multiplex networks with 1000 nodes per layer , with different standard topologies , including clustered networks , are presented in the supplemental material accompanying this letter , all them showing perfect agreement with the developed analysis .    in conclusion , we have developed a formalism to unveil the time scales of diffusive processes on multiplex networks . the approach has been specifically presented for a two - layer multiplex , in a particular set up in which nodes are preserved through layers . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained analytical results in the two asymptotic limits of small and large diffusion coefficients between layers . </S>",
    "<S> the findings show that the multiplex structure is able to speed up the less diffusive of the layers . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , it could also give rise to a super - diffusion process thus enhancing the diffusion of both layers . </S>",
    "<S> this striking result appears when one considers that the diffusion between the layers of the multiplex is faster than that occurring within each of the layers . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it paves the way to the analysis of super - diffusion processes in real multiplex scenarios such as multimodal transportation systems . on more general grounds , </S>",
    "<S> given the wide applicability of the properties of the laplacian to address many dynamical properties of networked systems , our results constitute a first step towards a better understanding of linear and nonlinear processes on top of multiplex structures .    </S>",
