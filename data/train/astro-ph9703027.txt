    "over scales @xmath7 1 kpc up to the hubble radius , the dynamics of cosmological systems is influenced , and often dominated , by non - radiating matter which reveals itself only through a gravitational interaction with the luminous matter . as the observational evidence has been accumulating ,",
    "it has become apparent that understanding the nature , history and structural properties of this dark component , is the focal point of cosmology at the end of the millennium . in particular , the halos of dark matter , detected around galaxies , have driven the dissipative infall of baryons that , modulo a variety of initial conditions , has built the bulge / disk / spheroid systems we observe today .",
    "it is remarkable that the @xmath8 galaxies present within the hubble radius can be classified in a very small number of types : ellipticals , spirals , low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , dwarf spirals and dwarf irregulars .",
    "the main characterizing property of these families is their position in the @xmath9 , m@xmath10 ( central surface brightness , magnitude ) plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_b ] ) . in this plane spiral",
    "galaxies lie at the center and show a very small range ( @xmath11 mag ) in @xmath9 ; ellipticals are very bright systems , and span only a factor 10 in luminosity , that however well correlates with central brightness ; lsb galaxies are the counterpart of spirals at low surface brightness ; and , finally , dwarfs are very - low - luminosity spheroids or disks which barely join the faintest normal systems and span the largest interval in @xmath9 .",
    "cosmologically , all galaxy types are equally important for at least two reasons : _ ( a ) _ those types having a lower average luminosity are however much more numerous and hence can store a significant amount of baryons , and _",
    "( b ) _ the properties that characterize and differentiate the various hubble types , i.e. the angular momentum content and the stellar populations , are intimately related to the process of galaxy formation .",
    "a systematic presence of dark matter was first found in spirals , specifically from the non - keplerian shape of their rotation curves ( rubin et al .",
    "1980 ; bosma 1981 ) , and in dsph s from their very high tidal @xmath2 ratios ( faber & lin 1983 ) . later",
    ", dark matter has been sistematically found also around dwarf spirals and lsb galaxies ( romanishin et al .",
    "1982 ) . for ellipticals ,",
    "the situation is less clear : certainly at least some ( if not all ) show evidence of a massive dark halo in which the luminous spheroid is embedded ( e.g. fabricant & gorenstein 1983 ) .",
    "therefore , the claim for the ubiquitous presence of dark halos around galaxies may be observationally supported .    theoretically , this claim is the natural outcome of the bottom - up cosmological scenarios in which galaxies form inside dark matter halos ( probably with a universal density profile ; e.g. , frenk et al . 1988 and navarro et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we point out that this prediction has so far been tested only in spirals where reliable dm profiles have been obtained ( persic , salucci & stel 1996 ; hereafter pss96 ) . along the hubble sequence , the systematic presence of dark matter in galaxies and its relation with the luminous matter",
    "has so far been poorly known . however , in the past year or so a number of observational breakthroughs ( some of which presented at this conference ) have allowed us to obtain the gravitational potential in numerous galaxies of different hubble types ( including also lsb galaxies ) .",
    "the time is now ripe for attempting to derive the general mass profile of dark matter halos , as a function of galaxy luminosity and morphology . in this paper ( which is also a review describing much recent work )",
    ", we will try to answer , for the first time , a simple ( cosmological ) question : given a galaxy of hubble type t and luminosity @xmath3 , which halo is it embedded in ?",
    "the aim of this article is then to derive / review , by means of proper mass modelling , the mass distribution in galaxies of different luminosities and hubble types and to fit all of the various pieces into one unified scheme of galaxy structure .",
    "notice that the theoretical implications of the results presented here will be discussed elsewhere . in detail ,",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we review the properties of dm halos in spiral galaxies ; in section 3 we work out the dm mass distribution in lsbs and perform a comparative analysis with that in spirals ; in section 4 we derive / review the halo properties of elliptical galaxies ; in sections 5 and 6 we derive the properties of dwarf galaxies , irregulars and spheroidals .",
    "finally , in section 7 we propose a unified scheme for the dm halos around galaxies and their interaction with the luminous matter .",
    "( a value of h@xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 is assumed throughout . )",
    "the luminous ( @xmath7stellar ) matter in spiral galaxies is distributed in two components : a concentrated , spheroidal bulge , with projected density distribution approximately described by @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 being the half - light radius ; but see broeils & courteau 1997 ) , and an extended thin disk with surface luminosity distribution very well described ( see fig.[fig : light_profiles ] ) by : @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 being the disk scale - length ; freeman 1970 ) .",
    "let us take @xmath18 as the radius encircling @xmath19 of the integrated light : for an exponential disk @xmath20 is the limit of the stellar disk .",
    "the relative importance of the two luminous components defines the hubble sequence of spirals , going from the bulge - dominated sa galaxies to the progressively more disk - dominated sb / sc / sd galaxies .",
    "we recall that the spiral arms are non - axisymmetric density perturbations , traced by newly - formed bright stars or hii regions , which are conspicuous in the light distribution and perturb the circular velocity field through small - amplitude sinusoidal disturbances ( i.e. , wiggles in the rotation curves ) , but they are immaterial to the axisymmetric gravitational potential .",
    "this digression is to recall that fitting these features with a mass model is a mistake !",
    "the luminosity dependence of the urc strongly contrasts with the self - similarity of the luminosity distribution of stellar disks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : light_profiles ] ) : the luminosity profiles @xmath33 do not depend on luminosity .",
    "this reflects the discrepancy between the distribution of light and that of the gravitating mass .",
    "noticeably , this discrepancy increases with radius @xmath34 and with decreasing galaxy luminosity @xmath3 .",
    "the urc can be fitted by a combination of two components : _ ( a ) _ an exponential thin disk , approximated for @xmath35 as @xmath36 and _ ( b ) _ a spherical halo represented by @xmath37 @xmath38 with @xmath23 being the normalized galactocentric radius , @xmath39 the disk mass fraction at @xmath18 , and @xmath40 the halo core radius ( in units of @xmath18 ) .",
    "the disk+halo fits to the urc are extremely good ( fitting errors are within 1% on average ) at all luminosities ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vel_profiles ] ) when @xmath41 @xmath42    thus we detect , for the dm component , a central constant - density region of size @xmath43 , slightly increasing with luminosity .",
    "the transition between the inner , luminous - matter - dominated regime and the outer , dm - dominated regime occurs well inside the optical radius : typically at @xmath44 in low - luminosity galaxies , and farther out , closer to @xmath43 , at high luminosities ( see fig.[fig : vel_profiles ] ) .",
    "thus , the ordinary and dark matter are well mixed in the very stellar regions of spirals .",
    "the total halo mass can be evaluated by extrapolating the halo out to the radius , @xmath45 , encompassing a mean overdensity of 200 .",
    "we find : @xmath46 @xmath47 in good agreement with results derived from satellite and pair kinematics ( charlton & salpeter 1991 ; zaritsky et al .",
    "notice that @xmath48 ( in solar units ) .",
    "this implies that the halo mass function is not parallel to the observed galaxy luminosity function ( ashman , salucci & persic 1993 ) .",
    "the luminosity dependence of the disk mass fraction can be interpreted in terms of a mass - dependent efficiency in transforming the primordial gas fraction into stars .",
    "in fact , the total ( i.e. , computed at @xmath45 ) luminous mass fraction of a galaxy of luminosity @xmath3 is : @xmath49 this suggests that only the brightest objects reach a value comparable with the primordial value @xmath50 , while in low-@xmath3 galaxies only a small fraction of their original baryon content has been turned into stars .",
    "the luminosity dependence of the dm fraction found by persic & salucci ( 1988 , 1990 ) has been confirmed by direct mass modelling ( e.g. : broeils 1992 ; broeils & courteau 1997 ; sincotte & carignan 1997 ; see also ashman 1992 ) .    on scales",
    "@xmath51 , the halos have mostly the same structure , with a density profile very similar at all masses and an amplitude that scales only very weakly with mass , like @xmath52 .",
    "this explains why the kinematics of satellite galaxies orbiting around spirals show velocities ( relative to the primary ) uncorrelated with the primary s luminosity ( zaritsky 1997 ) . at very inner radii , however , the self - similarity of the profile breaks down , the core radius becoming smaller for decreasing @xmath53 according to : @xmath54 the central density scales with mass as : @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is the critical density of the universe ) .",
    "the regularities of the luminous - to - dark mass structure can be represented as a curve in the space defined by dark - to - luminous mass ratio , ( halo core radius)-to-(optical radius ) ratio , central halo density ( see pss96 ) .",
    "this curve is a structural counterpart of the urc and represents the only locus of the manifold where spiral galaxies can be found .",
    "the main properties of dark matter in spiral galaxies can then be summarized as follows :    @xmath57 substantial amounts of dark matter are detected in the optical regions of all spirals , starting at smaller radii for lower luminosities ;    @xmath57 the dark and the luminous matter are well mixed ;    @xmath57 the structure of the halos is universal : it involves a core radius comparable in size with the optical radius and a central density scaling inversely with luminosity ;    @xmath57 the ratio between luminous and dark matter is a function of luminosity ( or mass ) among galaxies . at a given ( normalized ) radius ,",
    "this ratio increses with increasing luminosity : the global visible - to - dark mass ratio spans the range between @xmath58 at very high luminosities and @xmath59 at @xmath6 .    the discovery of these features , describing the various stages of the processes leading to present - day galaxies , supersedes the observationally disproved paradigms of `` flat rotation curves '' and `` cosmic conspiracy '' .",
    "the central surface luminosity of spirals is normally about constant , at @xmath60 .",
    "recently , however , a large population of disk systems with a significantly lower surface brigthness ( @xmath61 ) has been detected ( schombert et al . 1992 ; driver et al .",
    "1994 ; morshidi et al .",
    "1997 ; see also disney & phillips 1983 ) . in these systems",
    "the light distribution follows that of an exponential thin disk ( mcgough & bothun 1994 ) , with total magnitude @xmath62 mag fainter than that of normal ( hsb ) spirals . at the faint end of the lsb luminosity distribution ( m@xmath63 )",
    ", the galaxies have very extended hi disks whose kinematics yields the mass structure ( de blok , mcgaugh & van der hulst 1996 ) . in detail ,",
    "de blok et al . have published the hi rotation curves of 19 low-@xmath3 lsbs , having m@xmath64 mag , @xmath65 km s@xmath13 , and ( remarkably ) @xmath66 kpc , roughly independent of luminosity .",
    "these galaxies are the counterpart of the faintest hsb spirals .",
    "notice that , although the maximum velocities are similar , the optical sizes of lsbs are @xmath67 times larger than those of hsbs .    the objects in de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) are all within a small range of magnitudes and optical velocities , @xmath68 , @xmath69 km s@xmath13 . from these data",
    "we construct , as we did for spirals , the coadded rotation curve @xmath70 .",
    "notice that , unlike for spirals , rotation curves of lsbs with higher @xmath71 are not available : so we can compare lsb and spiral rcs only at their lowest velocities , shown for spirals in the top left panel in fig.[fig : vel_profiles ] and for lsbs in fig.[fig : lsb_curve ] ( points ) . in detail , in the latter figure we plot @xmath72 , the coadded rc obtained from the de blok et al .",
    "data , together with the spiral @xmath73 for the same range of maximum velocities ( 50100 km s@xmath13 ) ( see pss96 for all of the details ) .",
    "the agreement is striking : no difference can be detected between the lsb and hsb rotation curves , which coincide within the observational uncertainties .",
    "notice that the lsb and hsb rotation curves are identical when the radial coordinate is normalized to the disk length - scale ( essential procedure for determining the dm distribution ) .",
    "the fact that , when expressed in physical radii , lsb rotation curves rise to their maximum more gently than hsb rcs ( see fig.3 of de blok & mcgough 1997 ) , depends exclusively on the larger lsb disk scalelengths .    for lsbs",
    "we adopt a mass model including , as for spirals , _",
    "( i ) _ an exponential thin disk and _ ( ii ) _ a dark halo of mass profile given by eq.([eq : halo_vel ] ) .",
    "the lsb coadded rc is extremely well fitted by eqs.([eq : disk_vel ] ) and ( [ eq : halo_vel ] ) with the ` spiral ' values @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these parameters imply that lsb galaxies are completely dominated by a dark halo with a large @xmath76 kpc core radius .",
    "higher - luminosity ( up to m@xmath77 ) lsbs do exist ( e.g. , sprayberry et al . 1993 ) : their structure can be tentatively investigated by means of their tully - fisher relationship .",
    "observationally , these objects show a good correlation between luminosity and the corrected linewidth @xmath78 ( matthews et al . 1997 ) : @xmath79 where @xmath80 corresponds to m@xmath81 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lsb_tf_rl ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath78 is , as in spirals , a good measure of the circular velocity at @xmath43 : then @xmath82\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 .",
    "for lsb spirals we take the same dark - to - visible mass ratios as for hsb spirals , @xmath84 ( see conclusions of pss96 ) , and we assume @xmath85 .",
    "finally , by using the lsb luminosity - radius relation , @xmath86 kpc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lsb_tf_rl ] ) , we are able to reproduce the observed m@xmath87log@xmath88 relation : in fig .  [",
    "fig : lsb_tf_rl ] we show the excellent agreement between the observed linewidths and those predicted by our mass model when @xmath89 and the lsbs stay on the ` spiral ' @xmath90@xmath3 and @xmath40@xmath3 relationships .    at @xmath7@xmath91 ,",
    "the lsb stellar @xmath2 ratios are similar to those of hsbs , but they decline steeply with decreasing luminosity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lsb_model ] , left panel ) .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the @xmath92 ratios obtained by applying the maximum - disk hypothesis to solve for the galactic structure : in this case log@xmath93 increases from @xmath94 to @xmath95 across the entire lsb luminosity ( velocity ) range ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "the central overdensities , @xmath96 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsb_model ] ( right panel ) as a function of luminosity .",
    "they are smaller and less dependent on galaxy luminosity than those in normal spirals , in agreement with the findings by de blok & mcgough ( 1997 ) .    with the caveat of the relative smallness of the present sample , we claim that lsb galaxies are indistinguishable from hsbs in the @xmath97 ) space describing the coupling between dark and visible matter .    to end this section , we comment on the argument , raised sometimes , according to which the discovery of a large number of lsbs would make the findings on dm in spirals ( e.g. pss96 ) irrelevant , in that normal spirals would represent an unfair , biased sample of galaxies",
    "there is no doubt that the existence of a population of lsb galaxies , contiguous to the hsbs , affects the interpretation , and even the physical meanings , of luminosity functions and number counts .",
    "however , it is exactly the characteristic difference between the two families that answers the point . even prior to any mass modelling",
    ", we can argue that in the universe there are about @xmath98 disk systems obeying the `` freeman law '' : @xmath99 independent of galaxy luminosity .",
    "it is obviously necessary to know the dm properties of this family , independently of the existence of another family of disk systems not obeying such a `` law '' , and maybe not even observable .",
    "of course , investigating the dm properties of lsbs is equally important and crucial .",
    "furthermore , the argument raised above appears even more immaterial after the analysis of the lsb rotation curves .",
    "in fact , as far as the structural parameters are concerned , hsbs and lsbs are indistinguishable . in other words , lsbs follow the spiral @xmath100 , but strongly deviate with respect to the spirals luminosity(disk length - scale ) relation .",
    "elliptical galaxies are pressure - supported , triaxial stellar systems whose orbital structure may depend on their angular momentum content , degrees of triaxiality and velocity dispersion anisotropy .",
    "as is well known , the derivation of the mass distribution from stellar motions is not straightforward as it is from rotation curves in disk systems , because the kinematics of the former is strongly affected by geometry , rotation , and anisotropies .",
    "however , in addition to stellar kinematics , there are a number of mass tracers ( x - ray emitting halos , planetary nebulae , ionized and neutral disks ) which crucially help to probe the gravitational potential out to external radii ( see danziger 1997 ) .",
    "the luminosity profile @xmath101 of e s is obtained from the observed projected surface density , which follows the de vaucouleurs profile [ see eq.([eq : devaucouleurs ] ) ] , by assuming an intrinsic shape and deprojecting .",
    "a very good approximation for @xmath101 is the hernquist profile : @xmath102 ( where @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) . as the hernquist profile is no longer a good fit for @xmath105 , from actual surface - photometry profiles",
    "we have evaluated that @xmath106 , where @xmath107 kpc ( from djorgovski & davis 1987 ) .",
    "all ellipticals belong , within a very small cosmic scatter ( @xmath108 ) , to a relation of the type : @xmath109 where @xmath15 is the half - light radius , @xmath110 is the mean surface brightness within @xmath15 , and @xmath111 is the observed ( projected ) central velocity dispersion . in the logarithmic space",
    ", this corresponds to a plane , the fundamental plane of ellipticals ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) , that constrains the properties of the dm distribution .",
    "observations indicate @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) and @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) in the @xmath116-band and @xmath117-band , respectively ( e.g. , djorgovski & santiago 1993 ) . assuming a constant @xmath2 and structural homology , the virial theorem predicts @xmath118 , @xmath119 . the simplest explanation of the departure of @xmath120 from the virial expectation involves a systematic variation of @xmath2 with @xmath3 , which also accounts for the wavelength dependence of @xmath120 ( djorgovski & santiago 1993 ) .",
    "the departure of @xmath30 from the virial expectation is likely to be due to the breakdown of the homology of the luminosity structure ( see caon , capaccioli & donofrio 1993 ; graham & colless 1997 ) . assuming spherical symmetry and isotropic stellar motions ( so @xmath121 and @xmath122 )",
    ", the fp implies that @xmath123 , inclusive of dark matter , is `` low '' : @xmath124 ( lanzoni 1994 ; bender , burstein & faber 1992 ) , and roughly consistent with the values predicted by the stellar population models ( tinsley 1981 ) .",
    "no large amounts of dm are needed on these scales , as it also emerges from mass models of individual ellipticals , obtained by analyzing the line profiles of the l.o.s velocity dispersion ( van der marel & franx 1993 ) , which show that the dm fraction inside @xmath15 is substantially less than @xmath125 ( i.e. @xmath126 ; see van der marel 1991 , 1994 ; rix et al .",

    "1997a , b ; carollo & danziger 1994 ; carollo et al . 1995 ) , as in spirals .",
    "we now investigate in some detail the effects of dm on the fundamental plane .",
    "for this purpose , let us describe , for mathematical simplicity , the dark halo by a hernquist profile [ eq.([eq : hernquist ] ) ] with a lower mass concentation than the luminous spheroid : @xmath127 ( see lanzoni 1994 ) .",
    "we recall that dark halos are likely to have an innermost constant - density region not described by eq.([eq : hernquist ] ) : this , however , has no great relevance here , in that most of the dark mass is located outside the core where eq.([eq : hernquist ] ) is likely to hold . without loss of generality , we consider isotropic models ( lanzoni 1994 ) : the radial dispersion velocity @xmath128 is related , through the jeans equation , to the mass distribution by : @xmath129 the projected velocity dispersion is then @xmath130 .",
    "this equation shows that , at any radius ( including @xmath131 ) , the measured projected velocity dispersion @xmath132 depends on the distributions of both dark and luminous matter out to @xmath133 .",
    "conversely , in spirals the circular velocity @xmath134 depends essentially only on the mass inside @xmath135 , namely on just the luminous mass when @xmath136 .",
    "if @xmath53 is the total galaxy mass , we get @xmath137    the mass dependence of @xmath138 , combined with the thinness of the fp ( i.e. : @xmath139 ) , constrains the scatter that would arise , according to eq.([eq : sigma ] ) , from random variations of the total amount of dm mass in galaxies with the same luminous mass . from eq.([eq : fp ] ) we get @xmath140 , while eq.([eq : sigma ] ) implies @xmath141 .",
    "this means that , over 2 orders of magnitude in @xmath142 , any random variation of the dark mass must be less than @xmath143 ( lanzoni 1994 ; renzini & ciotti 1993 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) . from eq.([eq : fp ] ) and since @xmath144 , we finally get @xmath145 , so that @xmath146 , as in spirals ( pss96 ) .",
    "let us notice that the these well - established constraints on the amount of dark matter in ellipticals , due to the existence of the fundamental plane , are however at strong variance with the extremely high values of the central @xmath2 ratios , @xmath147 , found in some objects , as a result of the dynamical models of bertin et al .",

    "let us point out that dirr s , although having a negligible amount of light , do have quite a large mass : @xmath182 with @xmath183 being the maximum luminosity observed in this family .",
    "dwarf ellipticals / spheroidals ( dsph s ) are the faintest observed galaxies in the universe and the least luminous stellar systems . yet they represent the most common type of galaxy in the nearby universe ( e.g. , ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .    given the low surface brightnesses involved , the main kinematical quantity tracing the gravitational potential , i.e. the velocity dispersion , can be determined by measuring redshifts of individual stars . ever since early measurements of dsph velocity dispersions , high @xmath2 ratios were derived implying large amounts of dm in these objects ( faber & lin 1983 ) .",
    "kormendy ( 1988 ) and pryor ( 1992 ) have shown that dsph s are dm dominated at all radii : core fitting methods ( richstone & tremaine 1986 ) yielded central dm densities of @xmath184 ( i.e. , overdensities of @xmath185 ) , a factor 10100 larger than the stellar ones .    however , only recent kinematic studies ( armandroff et al . 1995 ; hargreaves et al . 1994 , 1996 ; ibata et al . 1997 ; mateo 1994 ; queloz et al . 1995 ; vogt et al .",
    "1995 ) have gathered a suitable number ( @xmath186 ) of galaxies with central velocity dispersion derived by repeat measurements of motions of @xmath187 stars .",
    "mateo ( 1997 ) , analysing this observational data , has shown that the central @xmath2 increases with decreasing galaxy luminosity ( see fig.[fig : dsph ] ) , implying , even in the innermost regions , the presence of a dark component whose importance increases with decreasing luminosity .",
    "we fit this @xmath2@xmath3 relationship by modelling the mass of these galaxies with _",
    "( i ) _ a luminous mass component with @xmath188 ( as mateo 1997 ) and _ ( ii ) _ a dark halo with profile given by eq.([eq : halo_vel ] ) .",
    "then , also these objects have a ` spiral ' dark - to - luminous mass ratio . for @xmath189",
    "the mass profile of a hernquist spheroid is very similar to that of a ` sphericized ' freeman disk , for which we can write @xmath190 $ ] .",
    "we obtain the model s central @xmath2 ratios from @xmath191/l(x)$ ] ( see fig.[fig : dsph ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the model and observations is striking , although _ ( a ) _ we have extrapolated luminosities and radial distances by a factor of @xmath192 and _ ( b ) _ the model has no free parameter . as a consequence ,",
    "we find @xmath193 , which is indistinguishable from mateo s best fit , @xmath194 independent of luminosity , and in qualitative agreement with pioneering studies of the dsph fundamental plane ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "the present data , referring to central regions , do not allow one to derive the run of @xmath40 with luminosity and then evaluate the central halo density .",
    "taking a tentative value for @xmath195 , the king radius , yields central overdensities @xmath196 which make these galaxies among the densest of the universe , as is obvious from the fact that these tiny galaxies withstand , at a distance of few tens of kpc , the gravitational tides of large galaxies like m31 and our own ( gallagher et al",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the structure of dark halos around galaxies has a universal character : a specific functional form , with two mass dependent - parameters , describes the density distribution of dark halos at any radius , in all galaxies of every hubble type . here , we discuss the basic properties of such a dm distribution and the relevant aspects of the interplay between dark and luminous matter .",
    "these can be divided into _ ( a ) _ universal properties , that is , not depending on hubble type , and _ ( b ) _ morphological properties which do depend on hubble type .      from the kinematics of a very large number of disk and spheroidal systems , there unquestionably emerges a one - to - one relation between a luminous galaxy and a massive dark halo .",
    "this is the rule : a hypothetical galaxy found with no dark halo should be considered as a peculiar exception .",
    "galaxies lie within large self - gravitating dark halos : more specifically , a disk / spheroid of size @xmath18 and mass @xmath142 , should be actually seen as embedded in a dark halo of radius @xmath197 and mass @xmath198 .",
    "@xmath199 the luminous matter , not surprisingly considering the dissipational collapse it has experienced , is more concentrated , by a factor @xmath200 , than the dark matter .",
    "this explains why the former nearly always dominates the inner regions of galaxies , where the luminous - to - dark matter density ratio is always @xmath201 . from the galaxy center out to @xmath202 ,",
    "the fraction of dm goes from @xmath203 up to @xmath204 .",
    "thus , all across the region where the baryonic matter resides , the dark and luminous components are well mixed , except in very - low - luminosity galaxies , dominated by the dark matter at all radii .",
    "thus , two common ( and competing ) ideas , according to which either _ i ) _ dark matter is the main component inside @xmath18 or _",
    "ii ) _ dark matter is important only where the stellar distribution ends , are both ruled out by observational evidence . in the same way , the very concept of mass - to - light ratio retains its physical meaning only if the radius at which a value is derived is specified .",
    "@xmath199 dm halos have core radii , i.e. regions of width @xmath43 , where the dm density remains approximately constant .",
    "let us stress that the core is apparent in every galaxy of every hubble type , not only in dirr s ( see moore 1994 ) . actually , this region is larger in larger galaxies , both in physical and in normalized units .",
    "the existence of core radii makes the central density of a dm halo a well - defined , physically meaningful quantity , and it implies that dm halos , even though arising from scale - free perturbations , do actually develop a scale , related with the half - light scale . the well proven existence of core radii , furthermore , rules out all halo models with a prominent central cusp or with a hollow core",
    ".    @xmath199 the dm central densities range through about 3 orders of magnitude , inversely correlated with galaxy luminosity ( see fig.[fig : dens_ml ] ) , consistently with hierarchical scenarios of galaxy formation in which smaller objects form first .",
    "@xmath199 proto - galaxies are likely to start their collapse with the same baryon fraction @xmath205 .",
    "however , in present - day galaxies this quantity strongly depends on the galaxy luminosity ( halo mass ) , ranging from @xmath206 at high masses @xmath207 , to @xmath208 at the lowest mass @xmath209 .",
    "the efficiency of retaining the primordial gas and transforming it in stars is then a strong function of the depth of the ( halo ) potential well .",
    "@xmath199 the range in luminosity among galaxies , @xmath210 orders of magnitude , is much wider than that of halo masses , which spans through @xmath211 orders of magnitude .",
    "this implies that the global mass - to - light ratios of galaxies decrease with increasing halo mass as @xmath212 .",
    "according to the above , considering all galaxies as having the same total mass , is not as bad as assuming that their masses and luminosities are directly proportional . in this light",
    ", the persistent habit in many cosmological studies of assuming @xmath213 should be avoided , if possible .      in fig.([fig : gamma ] ) we show the radial dependence of the dark - to - luminous mass ratio for the highest and lowest stellar masses , @xmath217 and @xmath218 , and the dark matter inside a fixed radius @xmath135 as a function of the luminous matter inside that radius .",
    "the dark - luminous coupling can be quantified by noting that , where the luminous mass is located ( @xmath219 ) , over five orders of magnitude in mass and independently of the total stellar ( or halo ) mass , @xmath220 ; this relationship breaks down where the stellar distribution converges .",
    "this interplay is the imprint of the late stages of the process of galaxy formation and rules out the concept of `` cosmic cospiracy '' . on the theoretical side",
    ", we emphasize that it is difficult to envisage how such a structural feature may arise in scenarios radically different from a ( cdm - like ) bottom - up .",
    "while the universal behaviour of the mass distribution of dark halos relates to the cosmological properties of dm , any hubble type dependence of the distribution of the luminous and dark matter characterizes the late processes of galaxy formation , such as transfer of angular momentum , the efficiency of the star formation and its feed - back on galaxy structure .",
    "remarkably , a small number of structural quantities allow one to describe the gross features of the morphological / luminosity dependence of the dm distribution and of the interplay with the luminous matter .",
    "these are : the central dm density @xmath221 , the core radius @xmath40 ( in units of @xmath18 ) and the luminous - to - dark mass ratio evaluated at the optical radius . for each hubble type ,",
    "the above structural paramenters are all functions of luminosity and then correlate among themselves . in fig.([fig : granrosario ] ) we show , for each hubble type , the curves generated in the space @xmath222 by the variation of luminosity .",
    "we note that :    @xmath223 the dm structural parameters and the connection with the luminous matter show a strong continuity when passing from one hubble type to another .",
    "this happens despite the fact that both the distribution and the global properties of the luminous matter show strong morphological discontinuities ;    @xmath223 dwarf galaxies , the densest galaxies in the universe , are also completely dark - matter dominated : however , their low baryon content just smoothly continues downwards the dependence with galaxy mass followed by larger galaxies . as this continuity extends to all other structural properties , the tendency to theoretically investigate these objects separately from `` normal '' galaxies could be misleading ;    @xmath223 spirals show the largest range in dark - to - luminous mass ratios and central densities , indicating that the occurrence of this morphological type is independent of the structure / evolution parameters considered here .",
    "this is probably because the main factor responsible for the formation of disk systems , i.e. the content of angular moment , is likely to be independent of halo mass ;    @xmath223 lsb galaxies are significantly less dense than normal spirals . as",
    "this is the case for both the dark and luminous components , the fractional amount of dark matter is not affected .",
    "this ratio , as well as the size of the halo core radius , depends on galaxy luminosity as in hsb spirals .",
    "lsbs , instead , are clearly distinguished by having both lower @xmath221 and lower stellar mass - to - light ratios .",
    "this suggests that the differentiation between hsb and lsb galaxies is due to different initial conditions ( e.g. , content of angular momentum , epoch of formation ) rather than being developed during the late stages of formation ;    @xmath223 ellipticals , considered as luminous spheroids , are well characterized objects , evidently very different from disk systems .",
    "however , in the structural parameter space , e and s galaxies are contiguous , the main difference being that the former are more concentrated in both the dark and luminous components . combined with the evidence that the dark halos of ellipticals have smaller core radii ( both in normalized and in physical units )",
    ", this morphological property may be due to a deeper baryonic infall in the halo potential well .",
