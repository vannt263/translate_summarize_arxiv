    "it is shown in @xcite-@xcite that aperiodic sampling has more benefits over periodic sampling , which motivates control researchers towards event - triggered control . in event - triggered control , sensing , communication and computation happens only when any predefined event condition is violated .",
    "event - triggered control strategy finds applications in different control problems like tracking @xcite , estimation @xcite-@xcite etc .",
    "event - triggered system is modeled as a perturbed system in continuous and discrete time domain respectively @xcite .",
    "also the behaviour of such system is described by an impulsive dynamics in literature @xcite-@xcite . to achieve larger average inter - event time , @xcite proposes a dynamic event - generating rule over the previous approach @xcite , which makes event - triggered strategy more computationally efficient and predictable .",
    "the input to state stability ( iss ) property @xcite-@xcite is exploited to prove the closed loop stability and to define triggering condition for event - triggered system .",
    "sahoo et al @xcite proposed an event based adaptive control approach for uncertain systems .",
    "they use a neural network to estimate the nonlinear function to generate the control law . in event based robust control problems , the uncertainty is mainly considered in the communication channel in the form of time - delay or data - packet loss @xcite .",
    "the main shortcoming of the classical event - triggered system lies in the fact that one must know the exact model of the plant apriori .",
    "a plant with an uncertain ( system ) model is a more realistic scenario and has far greater significance .",
    "however , there are open problems of designing a control law and triggering conditions to deal with system uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties mainly arise due to system parameter variations , unmodeled dynamics , disturbances etc . which require the design of robust controller .",
    "an optimal control approach to robust controller design for the uncertain system has been reported in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the applications include tracking problem in robot manipulator @xcite-@xcite , set - point regulation in cstr system etc .",
    "to achieve an optimal solution to the robust control problem there is a need to minimize a cost functional . in this direction , a non - quadratic cost functional",
    "is utilized to solve robust control problem with input constraint @xcite-@xcite . in the above mentioned approach ,",
    "event - trigger based implementation of robust control law is not considered which is essential in the context of networked control systems ( ncs ) .",
    "+ this paper considers the robust control strategies of linear uncertain system with limited state and input information .",
    "the limited state information is considered to address the channel unreliability or bandwidth constraint which is a very common phenomena in ncs . to capture the channel unreliability and bandwidth limitations ,",

    "a dedicated computing unit monitors the event condition at the sensor end .",
    "the aperiodic state transmission to controller and control input update instant @xmath0 over the network is decided by the same event - triggering law . for simplification",
    ", it is assumed that there is no communication , computation and actuation delay in the system . to design robust control law ,",
    "an equivalent optimal control problem is formulated with an appropriate cost functional which takes care of the upper bound of system uncertainty .",
    "the nominal system dynamics is used to compute the optimal controller gain which minimizes the cost - functional . a zero - order - hold ( zoh ) at the actuation end holds the last transmitted control input until the transmission of next input .",
    "the analysis of this system is done in continuous time domain .",
    "the proposed method is verified for both static and dynamic event - triggering rule . in both cases corresponding triggering rule and their stability criteria for matched and unmatched uncertain system",
