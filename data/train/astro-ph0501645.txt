    "the energy for the disruption comes from the thermo - nuclear burning of c and o into @xmath16  @xmath7   of @xmath1ni , a radioactive element that is the source of @xmath1fe , the most abundant iron isotope ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "explosive nucleosynthesis is not the driver behind the explosion ( the energy comes from the gravitational collapse of the stellar core ) .",
    "the hot , inner regions of the supernova typically produce 0.1  @xmath7  of @xmath1ni , but with a larger variation in yield from one core collapse event to another .",
    "the most telltale signs of the synthesis of radioactive material are the lengths and shapes of supernova light curves .",
    "although the expanding plasma cools adiabatically , radio - activity heats the plasma making the supernova visible for an extended period .",
    "the amount of radioactive material can be estimated from modeling the light curves , taking into account radiative transfer in the expanding atmosphere , the possible escape of positrons , and mixing @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray  emission from the radioactive elements can in principle be observed directly .",
    "although in the early phases of the supernova the atmosphere is opaque to @xmath0-rays , at later phases @xmath0-ray  emission should emerge .",
    "in fact the phase at which @xmath0-rays  emerge is an important diagnostic tool in itself @xcite .",
    "the spectral information can be used to measure the velocity distribution of the radioactive material .",
    "the goal of @xmath0-ray  observations of fresh radioactive material is to provide new insights into the yields , expansion velocities and asymmetries of the explosive nucleosynthesis products .",
    "moreover , the line emission from the longer lived radioactive element @xmath3tiis a tracer of recent supernova activity .  at 1809 kev , with an decay time of @xmath17  yr .",

    "this is of particular interest for cosmology , as type ia supernovae are used as standard candles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the prime interest is to understand the nature of the explosion mechanism .",
    "this has become more important now that gamma - ray bursts appear to be related to core - collapse supernovae , which challenges our view of the core - collapse explosion mechanism in general .",

    "@xcite consider various bipolar supernova models , which indeed give a higher @xmath3ti  yield .",

    "the bipolar models have a higher @xmath3ti/@xmath1ni  ratio , which is in better agreement with the @xmath3ti  and @xmath1ni  estimates of sn 1987a .    both mass loss and a higher explosion energy result in a reduced fall back of ejecta on the proto - neutron star / black hole , since both affect the final velocity of the ejecta .",
    "it can be argued that for casa  all those effects play a role .",
    "after all , casa  was probably a type ib supernova , and the ejecta mass as measured in x - rays is quite low , in the range 2 - 4@xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the kinetic energy , as derived from the supernova remnant s kinematics @xcite has been estimated to be @xmath45  erg @xcite . finally , there is ample evidence for asymmetric ejecta expansion @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3ti  yield , therefore , strengthens our current ideas about casa , but one should keep in mind that the predicted @xmath3ti  yields are uncertain .",
    "most simulations are based on one - dimensional models , in which artificially energy or momentum is deposited at the base of the ejecta .",
    "multidimensional models of core - collapse supernovae show that the ejecta kinematics is highly turbulent , which is likely to have an effect on the @xmath3ti  yield . moreover , there is still uncertainty whether magnetic fields and rotation are important for the explosion mechanism @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the high fluxes associated with @xmath3ti  decay from casa , might also be the result of a change in effective life - time of @xmath3ti , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the reason is that @xmath3ti  decays through electron capture , which in most cases involves the capture of one of the inner most , k - shell , electrons .",
    "if the @xmath3ti  is sufficiently ionized , i.e. one or both k - shell electrons are absent , the electron capture rate drops significantly .",
    "however , to have an effect the ionization should have taken place early in the life of the remnant , in order to inhibit the decay of a substantial amount of @xmath3ti .",
    "this is unlikely to be the case for casa , given the fact that x - ray spectroscopy indicates that both ca and fe , which have similar ionization cross sections , are still ionizing . a hot plasma is roughly in equilibrium ionization if @xmath46@xmath47 @xmath48s , whereas in casa  it is typically @xmath46@xmath49 @xmath48s . ] and are presently in the he - like state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "finding this out is one of the goals of _ integral",
    "_  observations of casa .",
    "more detailed hydrodynamical calculations also indicate that the ionization history has only a minor effect on the @xmath3ti  line flux @xcite .",

    "it is unlikely that these two supernovae were truly the last , so other supernovae must have been too dim to be noted , and their remnants may still escape our attention .",
    "the reason could be that galactic supernovae have been heavily obscured , and their remnants are faint because they evolve in low density regions .    the @xmath0-ray  emission from @xmath3ti , however , does not depend on the environment of the supernova , and @xmath0-rays",

    "the spi map is made with the _ spiros _ imaging software using the mean count modulation ( mcm ) method for the background modeling @xcite .",
    "both single and double detector events were used , excluding time intervals with high background rates . the map shown in fig .",
    "[ ibisspec ] covers the energy range 1142 - 1172  kev , which corresponds to a total velocity width of @xmath627800  kms@xmath10 , the velocity width that can be expected if most of the @xmath3ti  is situated in or is interior to the bright x - ray shell @xcite .",
    "neither this map , nor the analysis of the available data in a narrow energy range from 1155 kev to 1159  kev yield a significant detection . however , a 1.8@xmath14 excess is found within 2  of the position of casa  with a flux of @xmath63  ph@xmath9s@xmath10 , similar to the flux measured by _ bepposax _  and _ integral_-ibis .",
    "a preliminary analysis shows that narrow line @xmath3ti  emission ( @xmath64  kev,@xmath65  kms@xmath10 ) can almost be excluded at the 2 - 3@xmath14  level , as the 3@xmath14  upper limit for emission is @xmath66  ph@xmath9s@xmath10 the flux level found by _ comptel _   @xcite .",
    "and the 2@xmath14  upper limit is @xmath67  ph@xmath9s@xmath10 .",
    "it is , however , prudent to allow for a 10% systematic uncertainty in the flux calibration .",
    "note that without a detection , the exclusion of narrow line emission ultimately depends on the accuracy with which the overall @xmath3ti  emission is known .",
    "the planned observations of casa  by _ integral _  will help therefore in two ways : on the one hand ibis - isgri will allow us to make more reliable total flux estimates , on the other hand spi will provide either more stringent upper limits , which will help to constrain the line broadening , or a detection , in which case one can actually measure the line broadening .",
    "gamma - ray line emission from explosive nucleosynthesis products provides a view of what happens deep inside supernova explosions .",
    "explosion asymmetries and turbulence during the explosion can be deduced from the time of emergence , and doppler broadening of line emission from the short lived radioactive elements @xmath1ni  and @xmath1co .",
    "the longer lived radioactive element @xmath3ti   can be used to probe the explosion within a few hundred years after the supernova event .",
    "although , @xmath0-ray  astronomy is a specialized field , its results are of general astrophysical importance , as the nature of both type ia and core - collapse supernovae are not well understood .",
    "this is even more important now that type ia supernovae are used to probe the history and fate of the universe , and gamma - ray bursts appear to be connected with core - collapse supernovae .",
    "i have shown that @xmath0-ray - astronomy has already fulfilled part of its promise .",
    "the detection of @xmath1co  lines from sn 1987a has provided us with clues about the mixing of supernova ejecta , although the theoretical understanding of the observations is not yet complete .",
    "the detection of @xmath3ti  from casa  by _ comptel _  and _ bepposax _ , on the other hand , suggests that theoretical models underpredict the @xmath3ti  yield .    the work that started with _ smm _ , _ comptel _  and _",
    "bepposax_-pds  and other experiments is continued with esa s _ integral _  mission . for the more distant future",
    "several satellite missions are envisioned ranging from focusing telescopes , using grazing incidence telescopes with multi - layer coating , von laue lenses ( i.e. using bragg - crystals * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a new compton telescope @xcite .",
    "at the time of this writing _ integral",
    "_  is in its second observing cycle , having already produced the first results on 511  kev , @xmath55al , and @xmath3ti@xmath0-ray  line emission , which will be improved upon in the near future . and",
    "with some luck a not too distant type ia supernova may produce detectable @xmath0-ray  line emission , or , we might even be as lucky as tycho brahe and johannes kepler and observe a galactic supernova .",

    "<S> the most important @xmath0-ray  lines result from the decay chains of @xmath1ni , @xmath2ni , and @xmath3ti . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1ni  is the prime explosive nucleosynthesis product of type ia supernovae , and its decay determines to a large extent the type ia light curves . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1ni  is also a product of core - collapse supernovae , and in fact , @xmath0-ray  line emission from its daughter product , @xmath1co , has been detected from sn1987a by several instruments . </S>",
    "<S> the early occurrence of this emission was surprising and indicates that some fraction of @xmath1ni , which is synthesized in the innermost supernova layers , must have mixed with the outermost supernova ejecta .    </S>",
    "<S> special attention is given to the @xmath0-ray  line emission of the decay chain of @xmath3ti  ( @xmath3ti@xmath4  @xmath3sc@xmath4  @xmath3ca ) , which is accompanied by line emission at 68  kev , 78  kev , and 1157  kev . </S>",
    "<S> as the decay time of @xmath3ti  is @xmath5  yr , one expects this line emission from young supernova remnants . </S>",
    "<S> although the @xmath3ti  yield ( typically @xmath6  @xmath7 ) is not very high , its production is very sensitive to the energetics and asymmetries of the supernova explosion , and to the mass cut , which defines the mass of the stellar remnant . </S>",
    "<S> this makes @xmath3ti  an ideal tool to study the inner layers of the supernova explosion . </S>",
    "<S> this is of particular interest in light of observational evidence for asymmetric supernova explosions .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-ray  line emission from @xmath3ti  has so far only been detected from the supernova remnant casa . </S>",
    "<S> i discuss these detections , which were made by _ comptel _  </S>",
    "<S> ( the 1157  kev line ) and _ bepposax _  ( the 68  kev and 78  kev lines ) , which , combined , give a flux of @xmath8  ph@xmath9s@xmath10  per line , suggesting a @xmath3ti  yield of @xmath11  @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , i present some preliminary results of casa  observations by _ integral _ , which so far has yielded a @xmath12 detection of the 68  kev line with the isgri instrument with a flux that is consistent with the _ bepposax _  detections . future observations by _ integral_-isgri will be able to constrain the continuum flux above 90 kev , as the uncertainty about the continuum shape , is the main source of systematic error for the 68 kev and 78 kev line flux measurements . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , with the _ integral_-spi instrument it will be possible to measure or constrain the line broadening of the 1157  kev line . </S>",
