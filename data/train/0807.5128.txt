    "<S> we update the numerical results for the s - wave @xmath0 scattering phase - shift difference @xmath1 at @xmath2 from a previous study of isospin breaking in @xmath3 amplitudes in chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we include recent data for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 decay widths and include experimental correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> la - ur-07 - 8412    the authors of refs .   and   have shown the importance of taking into account radiative corrections in @xmath6 decays both in experimental measurements and theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , these corrections are enhanced in the extraction of the phase shifts @xmath1 by the @xmath7 rule by a factor of @xmath822 . on the experimental side </S>",
    "<S> , kloe has measured with high accuracy the ratio of branching ratios ( brs ) for the decay @xmath9 to the decay @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement is fully inclusive of radiation for the @xmath11 channel , allowing an unambiguous comparison with theoretical predictions . for the extraction of the phase shift @xmath1 from @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> we follow ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> in the presence of electromagnetic interactions , the usual isospin decomposition of amplitudes becomes : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the infrared - finite amplitudes for the decays @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , and @xmath16 is the amplitude for the decay @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> these amplitudes are related to the decay rate by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath20 is associated with the effect of real and virtual photons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the following notation is introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> : @xmath21 where in the absence of electromagnetic interactions the @xmath22 are the standard isospin amplitudes and the phases @xmath23 are identified with the s - wave @xmath0-scattering phase shifts @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , we have , by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 7.20 ) and  ( 7.33 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> : @xmath25 and : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the coefficients of the leading ( @xmath28 ) octet and 27-plet weak non - leptonic chiral operators ( as defined in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2.6 ) and  ( 2.7 ) of ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that in order to arrive at eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sviluppo ] ) , a number of higher - order chiral effective couplings are needed . </S>",
    "<S> here we adopt the estimates given in section 5 of ref .  .    </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 depend on the chiral renormalization scale @xmath32 ( from the matching uncertainty in the low - energy constants ) and the tree - level @xmath33 mixing angle @xmath34 given by : @xmath35 we have obtained the values of these coefficients from the authors of ref .  .    </S>",
    "<S> eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ finiteampl ] ) , ( [ expampl ] ) , and  ( [ isospinampl ] ) can be combined to obtain @xmath36 where @xmath37 . using the expansion of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sviluppo ] ) , this system of equations can be written in terms of the three unknowns , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we solve this system using a numerical minimization procedure .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental inputs used to obtain the amplitudes by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ expampl ] ) are listed in table  [ tab : exp ] . </S>",
    "<S> as noted above , the brs for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are obtained from the kloe measurement of their ratio , which accounts for the large value of the correlation coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the br for @xmath5 is weakly correlated with the value of the @xmath43 lifetime by the fit performed in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations are taken into account in the minimization procedure . while the kloe measurement of the ratio of @xmath4 brs is fully inclusive of radiation in the @xmath11 channel , the inclusiveness of the value for @xmath44 from the fit in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> is less well defined . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is of lesser concern because of the dominance of the @xmath45 amplitudes .    </S>",
    "<S> .experimental inputs used to obtain @xmath46 , @xmath40 , and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with @xmath48  gev and @xmath49 we obtain : @xmath50 the error matrix is : @xmath51    we compute the systematic error by varying the chiral renormalization scale parameter @xmath32 from 0.5 gev to 1  gev , and the tree - level @xmath33 mixing angle @xmath34 from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , and taking half of the total variation as the uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic error matrix is : @xmath54    including the systematic errors and using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deltacorr ] ) we have : @xmath55    the results in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phaseresult ] ) have been obtained using the central values for the higher - order chiral couplings estimated in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> within the large-@xmath56 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the quoted uncertainty reflects only the uncertainty in the matching scale . as already pointed out in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> ( section 7.3 ) , the extraction of @xmath46 and @xmath40 is rather sensitive to the input on the chiral couplings . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , even a simple variant of the large-@xmath56 procedure leads to changes in @xmath46 and @xmath40 at the @xmath57 level  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the values for @xmath27 quoted in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phaseresult ] ) are affected by an unknown systematic offset of at least @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> ( see also the analysis of ref .  . ) on the other hand , the extraction of the phase difference @xmath47 is quite insensitive to the input on the effective chiral couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the result for the phase difference @xmath1 instead depends quite sensitively on the estimate of the isospin - breaking correction of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deltacorr ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare the present result for @xmath1 with predictions from phenomenological evaluations . </S>",
    "<S> the roy equations @xcite determine the @xmath0 scattering amplitude in terms of its imaginary part at intermediate energies , up to two subtraction constants : the s - wave scattering lengths @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> colangelo , gasser , and leutwyler @xcite obtain values for @xmath58 and @xmath59 by matching a representation of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude from @xmath60 calculations in chiral perturbation theory with a phenomenological representation based on the roy equations . </S>",
    "<S> they obtain @xmath61 , which differs from our result by @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> kamiski , pelez , and yndurin @xcite fit experimental @xmath0 scattering amplitudes at both low and high energies with parameterizations that satisfy analyticity at low energy , constrained to satisfy the forward dispersion relations and the roy equations . </S>",
    "<S> they obtain @xmath63 , which differs from our result by @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that their input data includes low - energy s - wave phase shift determinations from @xmath65 and @xmath3 decays , including a preliminary result for @xmath66 from this update , differing very little from the value presented here . </S>",
    "<S> the significant discrepancies between our result , based on @xmath67 and @xmath43 br measurements , and the results of phenomenological analyses of @xmath0 scattering ( with or without constraints from chiral symmetry ) are puzzling and deserve further investigation . </S>"
