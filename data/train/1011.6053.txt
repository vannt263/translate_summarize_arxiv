    "when modeling heavy - ion collisions , one usually ignores momentum conservation .",
    "given the thousands of hadrons emitted in central collisions at rhic ( the relativistic heavy ion collider ) , such effects are of the order of a fraction of a percent .",
    "however , as will be illustrated here , high - quality data sets measured by the star collaboration have sufficient statistics and coverage to identify and analyze correlations at levels better than @xmath0 , enabling the identification and analysis of correlations due to momentum conservation .    in the last year star",
    "has reported two - particle angular correlations of the form @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 refers to the azimuthal angle measured relative to the reaction plane .",
    "correlations were reported for both same - sign , @xmath3 , and opposite - sign , @xmath4 , pairs .",
    "the difference between the two correlations , @xmath5 , was proposed to be a sign of parity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the idea was that the parity - odd topological charge in the qcd sector would couple the large out - of - plane coherent magnetic fields from the passing ions to @xmath6 in the qcd sector to create an out - of - plane electric field that would correlate out - of - plane charges of the same sign , or equivalently anti - correlate opposite - sign charges emitted out of plane .",
    "this would motivate a positive correlation for @xmath7 . to reduce the contributions from resonances ,",
    "the @xmath8 correlations were then subtracted from the @xmath9 correlations , i.e. , one would look for @xmath10 . to better determine whether the observed angular correlations were evidence of large parity fluctuations ,",
    "several more differential analyses have been performed : looking at the contributions to in - plane and out - of - plane separately @xcite or looking a charge balance functions @xcite .",
    "such studies suggest that most of the correlation in @xmath11 derives from another source . upon further consideration",
    "it appears that most of the correlations in @xmath11 derives from charge conservation overlaid onto elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "in fact , the more differential correlations encoded in charge balance functions @xcite were even reproduced at the quantitative level by overlaying local charge conservation onto a thermal blast - wave model which was tuned to single - particle spectra and elliptic flow .",
    "the effects of charge conservation overlaid onto elliptic flow only addressed @xmath11 and are irrelevant for explaining why the same - sign correlation , @xmath3 , was fairly large and negative . like the values for @xmath11 , the magnitude of the correlation",
    "was found to be of the order @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the multiplicity and @xmath14 is the elliptic flow .",
    "it was argued in @xcite and @xcite that such correlations might ensue from momentum conservation combined with elliptic flow .",
    "if for each particle emitted at angle @xmath15 , there was a particle balancing the transverse momentum at angle @xmath16 , one would find correlations , @xmath17 .",
    "the goals of this paper are : ( 1 ) to expand the discussions of momentum conservation in @xcite and to discern what combination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and with what weighting in momentum , would best isolate the effects of momentum conservation .",
    "( 2 ) to demonstrate the effects of momentum conservation with a simulation , compare to experiment , and see whether the observed correlations are consistent with expectations from momentum conservation . ( 3 ) investigate whether correlations of the class described above can be used to discern fundamental properties of the matter created at rhic , e.g. , the viscosity .",
    "the next sections presents the principles involved in observing momentum - conservation driven correlations with a focus on the momentum sum rule which drives the phenomenology .",
    "section [ sec : vdiffusion ] discuses the role of viscosity in spreading the correlation in relative rapidity .",
    "the pion cascade model is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] and compared to experimental results from star , while a summary and outlook are given in the final section .",
    "in the absence of competing correlations , such as charge conservation , the correlation @xmath18 , averaged over all pairs regardless of charge , would be well suited to study momentum correlations .",
    "even better would be the correlation , @xmath19 , which is similar but is determined more directly by momentum conservation .",
    "unfortunately , other correlations come into play which makes the choice of observable tricky .",
    "for instance , one might consider same - sign correlations as a way to avoid the effects of charge conservation .",
    "however , when one sees a positive particle at @xmath15 , there is an enhancement for having a negative particle at a similar angle and with similar momentum .",
    "the momentum of the negative particle also needs to be balanced , and the balancing momentum could be shared by other positive particles .",
    "one must also consider the fraction of the balancing momentum carried by unobserved particles .",
    "for instance , in the star analysis neutral particles are not measured and even with the large acceptance and relatively high efficiency a good fraction of the balancing momentum is outside detection .    to better clarify the issues above",
    ", the theory discussion is split into parts . in the first subsection",
    "the situation will be considered for a system with a single species .",
    "the momentum sum rule will be derived for perfect acceptance and efficiency , with a discussion of how it would be modified for less than perfect detectors .",
    "the more realistic case , accounting for undetected neutral particles and the effects of charge conservation , is then considered in the following subsection . the relations found here are applied and tested with a simple model in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .      for illustrative purposes we consider the case of @xmath13 particles emitted under the constraint of momentum conservation .",
    "rather than calculating @xmath20 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammadef ] ) , we consider the @xmath21 weighted correlation , @xmath22 if all the particles had the same @xmath21 , this would be no different than @xmath20 , which is defined solely through the angles . although the angular correlations are stronger for higher @xmath21 , @xmath23 surprisingly turned out to be several tens of percent smaller than @xmath20 in the simulations of the next section .",
    "this is due to the denominator @xmath24 , which weights high - momentum particles even more strongly in the denominator than the extra @xmath21 weightings in the numerator .",
    "if the denominator had been defined as @xmath25 rather than @xmath24 , @xmath23 would have been larger .",
    "the particular form in the definition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaprimedef ] ) is chosen to simplify the momentum sum rule shown below . since",
    "this form is most directly related to the sum rule , it exhibits less model dependence than other choices .    to derive the momentum sum rule ,",
    "one expands the definition of the averages assuming for the moment that all particles are measured , @xmath26 momentum conservation , @xmath27 , was applied in the third line .",
    "the final term resembles an expression for @xmath28 weighted by @xmath29 .",
    "assuming @xmath13 is large one can derive the momentum sum rule , @xmath30    the sum - rule above is based on a perfect acceptance . even for the star tpc detector , which has a broad acceptance of approximately @xmath31 units of rapidity , only about one third of the emission is addressed .",
    "since the averages @xmath32 are correlations , the sum rule is not affected by a less than perfect efficiency if the efficiency is uniform . however ,",
    "if the experiment has a limited acceptance , the sum rule can be significantly compromised .",
    "first of all , one must state whether @xmath13 refers to the multiplicity inside the acceptance , to the total multiplicity , or something in between .",
    "for instance , the star experiment has good coverage for pseudo - rapidities between -1 and 1 and for charged particles with transverse momenta above @xmath33200 mev/@xmath34 .",
    "one might choose @xmath13 as the multiplicity of particles with @xmath35 mev/@xmath34 , or one might use the usually reported measure of the multiplicity which assumes no @xmath21 cuts . if @xmath13 refers to the multiplicity within the acceptance , the sum - rule is modified by a factor @xmath36 , where @xmath36 is defined as the fraction of balanced momentum which falls within the acceptance , @xmath37 here , @xmath38 , and the sum rule becomes , @xmath39 part of the reduction , @xmath40 , comes from balancing momentum that is carried by particles with rapidities outside the acceptance .",
    "this can be estimated by looking at @xmath23 as a function of relative rapidity and then convoluting that with the rapidity distribution .",
    "given that the efficiency inside the acceptance will vary , the surest way to proceed is to model the correlations and simulate their measurement .",
    "unfortunately , either strategy introduces some model dependence , which is unavoidable once acceptances become complicated .    although transverse momentum is conserved globally , the balancing momentum for a specific particle might be , or might not be , spread over the entire collision volume . whereas star s analysis cover approximately @xmath31 units of rapidity , emission is spread over a half dozen units of rapidity . in the thermal calculations by @xcite , transverse momentum conservation was enforced globally .",
    "if one were to enforce conservation locally , the question would be `` how local ? '' . clearly , addressing this question is central to estimating the fraction @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule1species ] ) . during the initial interactions of the incoming nuclei , hard scatterings and fragmentation processes spread transverse momentum over a wide range of rapidity ,",
    "whereas according to the commonly accepted picture of a rhic collision , the subsequent processes are more local in nature , as the momentum transfers from subsequent collisions are shared amongst particles with similar rapidities .",
    "further , it is these collisions that build up elliptic flow . here",
    ", we will show how the lack of local momentum balance in the initial scattering does not affect the locality of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule1species ] ) as long as the particles created in the initial state have their momenta distributed isotropically in azimuthal angle .",
    "first , one considers a distribution of particles with initial momentum @xmath41 , whose final momentum is @xmath42 and whose net momentum transfer is @xmath43 , @xmath44 we will assume that the vectors @xmath45 are isotropic , i.e. , @xmath46 and that the momentum transfers conserve momentum within the neighborhood , @xmath47 here , @xmath40 is again the fraction of the balancing momentum exchanges , @xmath43 , that will be found within the acceptance . in the limit that the acceptance covers much more phase space than what is subtended by the diffusion of momentum from the transfers @xmath43 , @xmath48 , even if the collision then covers many more units . calculating the azimuthal correlation , @xmath49 where the isotropy of @xmath50 and local conservation of @xmath51 were both exploited . for the purposes of this derivation we consider a class of events with fixed @xmath13 , but will take the limit of large @xmath13 .",
    "one can also write an expression for the numerator for @xmath52 , @xmath53 where the isotropy of @xmath50 was again used .",
    "the equivalence of the the last expressions in eq.s ( [ eq : gammakqderiv ] ) and ( [ eq : v2kqderiv ] ) confirms eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule1species ] ) .",
    "if the momentum transfers responsible for elliptic flow build up during the first few fm/@xmath34 of the reaction ( but not in the initial state ) , one would expect the extent of @xmath23 as a function of relativity to depend on the diffusion of transverse momentum along the longitudinal direction , and thus perhaps on the shear viscosity .",
    "this will be explored in the next section .",
    "charge conservation affects both same - sign and opposite - sign correlations .",
    "it is straight - forward to understand how opposite - sign correlations become manifest . here ,",
    "we first describe how charge conservation also affects same - sign correlations . due to local charge conservation ,",
    "each charge ( aside from those carried by the incoming nuclei ) is accompanied by an extra charge of the opposite sign . since",
    "charge conservation is local , the two balancing charges will remain close to one another in coordinate space .",
    "the two balancing charges then flow together and are positively correlated in @xmath54 . if one triggers on a specific positive particle , one expects momentum conservation to provide negative correlations in azimuthal angle , and that the correlation would be spread out roughly equally among positive , negative and neutral particles .",
    "the same - sign correlations would be expected to account for one third of the momentum balance .",
    "however , that balance is increased by the fact that the original positive particle is accompanied by a negative particle with similar momentum .",
    "this accompanying particle s momentum must also be balanced , and if it has the same momentum as the original triggered particle , the momentum balance one would find amongst other positive particles would double , i.e. , one would expect nearly 2/3 of the original momentum of a triggered positive particle to be balanced by other positive particles .",
    "the first goal of this section is to find a combination of @xmath55 and @xmath56 that leads to a momentum sum - rule despite the correlation inherent due to each positive being balanced by a negative charge , and the complication due to roughly one third of the particles being neutral , and in the case of star , undetected . to proceed we consider a system with multiplicities @xmath57 for both positive and negative particles and multiplicity @xmath58 of neutrals",
    "assuming that charged particles correlate equally with neutrals as they do with particles of the same charge , one can write the various correlations as : @xmath59 using the symmetries listed above and assuming the multiplicities are large numbers , @xmath60 if @xmath13 refers to the net multiplicity of charged particles , @xmath61 , and if @xmath62 is the fraction of particles that are neutral , @xmath63 , one express the result as : @xmath64 for one third of the particles being neutral , @xmath65 , @xmath66 since this linear combination of same - sign and opposite - sign contributions seems most connected to the momentum sum rule , we define the quantities @xmath67 by explaining both @xmath11 , which focuses on correlations from charge conservation , and @xmath68 which is most related to momentum conservation , one would reproduce both the same- and opposite - sign correlations .",
    "the advantage of this choice is that the individual quantities can best be interpreted in terms of a single effect .    following the lines from the previous subsection , one can also account for lack of perfect acceptance , at which point one finds the following final expressions , @xmath69 here , the multiplicity @xmath13 is the actual measured multiplicity , and @xmath40 is the fraction of balancing momentum observed given the limited acceptance and efficiency . for a constant efficiency in a limited acceptance",
    ", efficiency reduces both @xmath40 and @xmath13 by the same factor , as expected since correlations should be unchanged by a constant efficiency .",
    "thus , this expression also works if @xmath13 is the total multiplicity inside the acceptance assuming perfect efficiency , as long as @xmath40 refers to the fraction of momentum inside the acceptance , not just what is measured . for complicated efficiencies and acceptances ,",
    "the model independence becomes somewhat compromised .",
    "however , even in that case the expression suggests that the combination @xmath70 is a good choice for an observable that would best isolate the effects of momentum conservation .",
    "additionally , one must consider the qualifier that analyses of @xmath28 yields a variety of results , differing by 10 - 20% , depending on how the analysis was performed .",
    "for the purposes of the sum rule , the value for @xmath28 should include some `` non - flow '' contributions , such as those arising from resonances .",
    "this is a good point for summarizing the assumptions that led to the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrules ] ) .",
    "first , it was assumed that the momentum transfers responsible for elliptic flow are locally balanced , i.e. , not spread over many units of rapidity .",
    "secondly , it was assumed that an unmeasured neutral particle would balance the momentum of a given charged particle identically as another charged particle of the same sign . if observations are not in line with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrules ] ) , one should question these two assumptions .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that transverse momentum diffuses longitudinally with the viscosity playing a role in determining the diffusion constant .",
    "restating the arguments , one can consider a boost - invariant system with a momentum per rapidity slice , @xmath71 or @xmath72 , where @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the stress - energy tensor as viewed by an observer moving with rapidity , @xmath75 . here",
    ", @xmath76 and @xmath77 play role of the longitudinal position and the proper time in bjorken coordinates , @xmath78 momentum conservation , @xmath79 , yields @xmath80 assuming the navier - stokes equation , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the shear viscosity , one then finds @xmath83 for small @xmath84 , @xmath85 , so the diffusion coefficient becomes @xmath86    for the correlations in a boost - invariant system , we define the correlation function for the interval @xmath87 , with the rapidty range @xmath88 , @xmath89 where the averaging , @xmath90 , denotes an average over events .",
    "if one subtracts the @xmath91 terms , one could identify the sum as the numerator used for calculating @xmath92 .",

    "( [ eq : vdiffusion ] ) , the evolution of @xmath93 is @xmath95 the condition that one must stay away from @xmath96 comes from the diffusion equation not being valid for scales so small that the individual particles correlations with themselves does not appear . to include @xmath96",
    ", one can consider the effects of collisions on @xmath97 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : piprimedef ] ) . comparing the instants immediately before and after a collision between particles @xmath98 and @xmath99 ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath97 involving other particles than those involved in the specific collision , @xmath100 , does not change because the total momentum carried by @xmath98 and @xmath99 does not change .",
    "however , the contribution to @xmath97 involving the colliding pair , @xmath101 , does change suddenly . to calculate the change ,",
    "consider the fact that the net momentum does not change , i.e. , @xmath102 one can then identify the change in @xmath97 as @xmath103 where it is assumed that the two scattering particles have the same coordinate @xmath76 .",
    "similar expressions can be derived for any @xmath104 process .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath97 due to the instantaneous collisions thus has two pieces .",
    "first , the motion of the particles in between collisions is responsible for the diffusive term .",
    "a second term involving the instantaneous changes due to collisions of two particles at the same rapidity can be identified as the collision rate multiplied by the average change of @xmath105 per collision , @xmath106    the second term in eq .",

    ". if the characteristic cross sections are a few tens of mb , and if the ratio @xmath119 is of order ten , the spread @xmath120 should be roughly a half unit of rapidity .",
    "this is the same scale as the spread due to the final thermal motion .",
    "the breakup conditions and flow can be well understood by either blast - wave analyses , or by fitting to hydrodynamic or to hybrid hydrodynamic / cascade models .",
    "this would allow isolation and determination of @xmath120 as a function of centrality . if taken in concert with a detailed model of the evolution that describes when elliptic flow was generated , this might provide insight into the viscosity .",
    "it should be emphasized that the simple calculations of this subsection , based on a boost - invariant model with no transverse flow , and with an assumption of a fixed number of massless particles with fixed cross sections , certainly can not be seriously applied to extract properties such as the viscosity from data .",

    "however , that conclusion is premature given the numerous shortcomings of the model .",
    "the only firm conclusion to be made here is that the sign and magnitude of @xmath11 from the model and from data are fairly similar .    since the cascade model employs isospin - independent cross section , the charge balance correlations can be calculated by comparing only a particle with its balancing partner , thus avoiding the noisy statistical subtraction involving charges from different balancing pairs .",

    "it was assumed that for a charged particle , finding the balancing momentum related to elliptic flow in other particles of the same charge would be identical to finding the balancing momentum in neutral particles .",
    "this assumption was explicitly enforced in the pion cascade , but could be different in a more realistic picture .",
    "for instance , for positive pions coming from @xmath152 decays , one would have a contribution in the same direction for neutral pions , which would not exist between the positive pion and other positive pions .",
    "the negative correlation with same - sign pions would then be stronger to compensate .",
    "the momentum transfers that build elliptic flow are locally balanced , i.e. , if a particle scatters into the reaction plane , the balancing momentum is likely to be found nearby in rapidity . for the momentum to be balanced by particles far removed in rapidity ,",
    "the transfers need to have occurred early in time , or perhaps even during the passing of the initial nuclei .",
    "the speed for which fluctuations of the transverse momentum can traverse the matter in the longitudinal direction is limited by the viscosity in a hydrodynamic context@xcite .",
    "violations of ( 1 ) would lead to stronger correlations than those predicted in the model .",
    "however , it is difficult to expect that by correcting the model with more realistic resonance contributions one might find corrections more than a few tens of percent .",

    ". these would be well below the times that would be reasonable for modeling the evolution as a cascade , even with partons .",

    "since @xmath92 has the more direct relation to the sum rule , it is less model - dependent . star certainly has the ability to determine @xmath92 , and has even analyzed the correlation differentially in terms of @xmath21 .",
    "two main conclusions come out of the studies here .",
    "first , momentum conservation does seem to play a principle role in determining the combination of opposite- and same - sign correlations , @xmath68 and @xmath92 . for a perfect acceptance",
    ", the rule seems unquestioned , except for the uncertainty in accounting for the fraction of momentum balance from unobserved particles ( mainly neutral particles ) .",
    "although the centrality dependence was not matched by the pion cascade model , the size of the effect was very much of the right order , and for more central collisions the spread in @xmath157 was rather well reproduced .",
    "the second conclusion concerns the failure of the pion cascade to reproduce the strong centrality dependence of @xmath68 seen in the data . star s",
    "results suggest that the correlation is spread over a large range in rapidity for peripheral collisions .",
    "one intriguing explanation of the model s failure is that whereas the model evolution began at 1 fm/@xmath34 , for peripheral collisions it is possible that the elliptic flow was generated while the system was in a coherent state . if coherent structures , like color flux tubes or the color glass condensate , extend a unit of rapidity or more , momentum conservation might no longer be local ( assumption # 1 above ) in @xmath76 . for this explanation to hold ,",
    "much of the elliptic flow would have to be generated while the system were in such a coherent state .",
    "whereas 1 fm/@xmath34 represents a small fraction of the time over which flow develops in a central collision , the first fm/@xmath34 should be more important for peripheral collisions , where the initial logarithmic density gradients are higher , and where the generation of flow finishes earlier .",
    "an even more speculative possibility is that in peripheral collisions elliptic flow might be generated at the initial point of contact between the nuclei .",
    "this might come from a preference for the individual nucleon - nucleon collisions to have their reaction planes coincide with the @xmath158 reaction plane , which could lead to initially anisotropic stress energy tensors with the momentum balance spread over multiple units of rapidity .",
    "however , our own quick analysis of glauber models does not suggest such an effect exists .",
    "if early flow is indeed dominating the explanation , it would serve as motivation to reconsider some analyses of elliptic flow , based on hydrodynamic pictures with little initial flow .",
    "these analyses have often been used to determine the viscosity of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .    both star s experimental analysis and the model analysis presented here",
    "can be improved .",
    "the pion cascade model was adequate for illustrating the effects , but is too far from reality to make any serious quantitative conclusion from a comparison to data .",
    "the experimental analysis will be strengthened by better statistics , by a more detailed study of systematics ( such as determining which method for @xmath28 is more appropriate for scaling @xmath68 ) and by evaluating @xmath92 in addition to @xmath68 .",
    "it is difficult to determine how to fix many of the deficiencies of the model .",
    "more realistic models require hydrodynamic prescriptions for the intermediate stage as well as dynamic models of the field - dominated pre - equilibrium stages , thus incorporating the generation and propagation of momentum fluctuations in such models is necessary .",
    "such advances are clearly challenging , but understanding the questions raised in the previous paragraphs would be valuable .",
    "this class of observables might ultimately provide insight into the state and nature of the pre - thermalized state , or might even assist in constraining bulk properties of quark - gluon plasma .",
