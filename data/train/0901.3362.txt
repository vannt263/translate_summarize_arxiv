    "the @xmath1- meson plays a unique role in the study of the hot and dense medium created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is is the lightest bound state of hidden strangeness @xmath4 , has a small interaction with other non - strange hadrons and hence carries information from the early partonic stages of the system evolution . comparing the elliptic flow ( @xmath5 ) of @xmath1 to the @xmath5 of other multistrange hadrons ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) or particles composed of lighter quarks ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) or heavier charm quark , provides information about the partonic collectivity of the medium .",
    "furthermore the @xmath1 can provide important information on particle production mechanisms , since it is a meson but has a mass similar to @xmath10 and @xmath11 baryons .",
    "the measurement of its nuclear modification factor , @xmath12 adds to the picture of particle suppression and its dependence on particle mass and composition supporting hydrodynamics and recombination models .",
    "the @xmath1 can also be sensitive to the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "a certain fraction of the @xmath1 can decay inside the hot and dense media leading to a change in its spectral function@xcite .",
    "this modification can be seen by studying the low - momentum @xmath1 decaying inside the media and reconstructed via the di - electron decay channel .",
    "since leptons are not subject to the strong interaction , they preserve their production information .",
    "a change in mass or width ( @xmath13 ) of @xmath1 inside the medium can lead to a change in the relative branching ratios of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 decay modes . since @xmath16",
    ", small changes in @xmath1 or @xmath17 can induce significant changes in the branching ratio .",
    "r0.5        the phenix detector@xcite at rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) has been designed to measure both leptons and hadrons . a schematic view of the phenix detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_phenix ] .",
    "each of the two central arm spectrometers covers 90@xmath18 in azimuth and @xmath190.35 in pseudorapidity and has the capability to measure neutral and charged particles .",
    "the high - resolution multi - wire proportional drift chambers ( dc ) together with the first layer of pad chambers ( pc1 ) provide the charged particle tracking and momentum measurement .",
    "the typical momentum resolution is @xmath20 1.1@xmath21 .",
    "the kaons are identified by using the timing information from a high resolution time of flight ( tof ) detector and the lead scintillator ( pbsc ) part of the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) , with good @xmath22 separation over the momentum range 0.3 - 2.5 gev/_c _ and 0.3 - 1 gev/_c _ , respectively .",
    "the electrons are identified using a ring imaging @xmath23erenkov detector ( rich ) and by requiring the energy measured in the emcal to match the measured momentum of the charged tracks in the dc .",
    "the zero degree claorimeters ( zdc s ) and beam beam counters ( bbc s ) are dedicated subsystems that measure global quantities such as luminosity , collision vertex and event centrality .",
    "the minimum bias trigger is derived by a coincidence between the two bbcs ; in @xmath0 and @xmath2 the trigger requires at least one hit in each bbc arm whereas for @xmath3 at least two hits in each bbc arm and one detected neutron in zdc is needed . in order to benefit from the high luminosity in @xmath0 and @xmath24 collisions and to efficiently detect electrons , a special online emcal rich trigger ( ert ) is used .",
    "it requires an event to have at least one track with an energy above a certain threshold in the emcal and a geometrically correlated hit in the rich .",
    "the results presented here correspond to the data for @xmath0 ( 2005 ) , @xmath2 ( 2003 ) and @xmath3 ( 2004 ) taken at @xmath25 = 200 gev @xmath25 = 62.4 gev .",
    "for the @xmath26 mass reconstruction , the charged tracks are combined to form pairs using three different techniques .",
    "the first one does not require any kaon identification and assigns the kaon mass to all tracks ( `` no kaon pid '' ) .",
    "the second method requires one track to be identified as kaon in the tof subsystem ( one kaon``pid '' ) , whereas the third method requires both the tracks to be identified as kaons either in tof or emcal subsystems ( `` two kaon pid '' ) .",
    "the `` no kaon pid ''  method allows us to go to high @xmath27 as compared to the other two , is a relatively simpler analysis , but with comparatively large b / s ratio .",
    "the `` two kaons pid ''  method allows us to go lower in @xmath27 and has small b / s ratio .",
    "the `` one kaon pid ''  method has the advantage of less background and so works with better accuracy for the low @xmath27 ( @xmath28 gev/_c _ ) region where `` no kaon pid ''  method has a large background .",
    "the @xmath0 data was analyzed using `` no kaon pid '' , and `` one kaon pid '' , @xmath24 using `` no kaon pid ''  and `` two kaons pid ''   and @xmath3 using `` one kaon pid''and `` two kaons pid '' .",
    "the 62.4 gev @xmath3 data was analyzed using `` two kaons pid ''  method only .",
    "the different analysis methods have very different sources of systematic uncertainities and provide a valuable consistency check . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_inv_spec_all - a ] , good agreement between the various methods can be seen .",
    "the combined @xmath0 result using `` one kaon pid ''  and `` no kaon pid ''  analyses constitutes a new @xmath0 reference for @xmath1-meson , surpassing the previous one@xcite , in @xmath27 and with smaller errors .    for @xmath29 ,",
    "electrons identified using rich and emcal are combined in pairs to generate like- and unlike - sign mass spectra . however , due to the limited azimuthal angular acceptance and the strong magnetic field beginning at r=0 , the identification and rejection of @xmath30 pairs from dalitz decays and photon conversions is very difficult@xcite .",
    "this results in a huge combinatorial background in @xmath3 , making this measurement difficult .    raw yields , for both @xmath31 and @xmath30 are then extracted either by simultaneously fitting the signal and background , or by integrating the spectra in the vicinity of the peak after subtraction of the combinatorial background , estimated using an event - mixing technique@xcite .",
    "the correction function takes into account the limited detector acceptance and resolution and reconstruction efficiency and was derived by a full single - particle monte carlo simulation , propagated through an emulator of the phenix detector and the full analysis chain .",
    "corrections to incorporate the trigger efficiency and multiplicity effects are applied too .",
    "[ fig : fig_inv_spec_all ] summarizes the @xmath1 measurements in @xmath0 , @xmath24 and @xmath3 collisons via di - kaon and di - electron decay modes .",
    "the integrated yields and temperature presented in fig .  [ fig : fig_dndy_t ] were extracted assuming @xmath32 dependent yields to be exponential and so fitting the @xmath32 spectra to the following exponential function with dn / dy and t as the parameters .",
    "@xmath33    the temperatures extracted in the two decay channels are in good agreement with each other , do not change between different collision systems but grow only slighlty from 62.4 gev to 200 gev as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig_dndy_t - a ]  &  [ fig : fig_dndy_t - c ] . the integrated yields normalized to the number of participants",
    "increase by almost a factor of two from peripheral to central @xmath3 collisions .",
    "particle yields in the @xmath30 channel seem to be higher than the corresponding @xmath31 decay channel , but the large systematic and statistical uncertainties in di - electron measurement prevent us from making any conclusive statement .",
    "the @xmath5 of @xmath1 was extracted following the @xmath34 method@xcite , using the @xmath35 decay mode .",
    "a detailed description of the analysis procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "results for @xmath5 as a function of @xmath36 for the @xmath1-meson together with @xmath37 are shown in the left ( right ) panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_v2 ] without ( with ) scaling with the number of valence quarks .",
    "it is clear from the left panel that despite its similar mass to the proton , @xmath38 for the @xmath1- meson follows the flow pattern of the other lighter mesons(@xmath39 and @xmath17 ) .",

    "[ fig : fig_v2 ] shows universal scaling behavior of the elliptic flow of baryons and mesons when both @xmath5 and @xmath36 are scaled with the number of valence quarks .",
    "this indicates that the elliptic flow develops during the early stage when the constituents of the flowing medium are partons and not ordinary hadrons interacting with their standard hadronic cross - sections .",

    "the nuclear medium effects on hadron production are quantified by the nuclear modification factor @xmath12 , defined as the ratio of the yield obtained from nucleus - nucleus collisions scaled down with the number of binary collisions , to the yield from elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "@xmath42    in the absence of any nuclear effects , the ratio should saturate at unity for high @xmath27 , where the production is dominated by hard scattering and is proportional to the number of binary collisions ( @xmath43 ) , in contrast to low @xmath27 region where soft processes dominate .",
