    "the application of stochastic geometry to the modeling and analysis of wireless networks has attained a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "it has enabled a new framework called _ transmission capacity _ ( tc ) framework , which led to many new profound results in the topic of wireless networks ( cf .",
    "the advantage of using a spatial model to describe the node positions rather than assuming a deterministic network topology is two - fold : first , such a probabilistic approach decouples the performance analysis from the _ actual _ topology , thereby increasing the generality of results .",
    "second , it provides powerful means for network optimization , especially for highly dynamic networks , where interference is ( unpredictably ) fast - varying . with few exceptions ,",
    "the node positions are mostly modeled as a _",
    "stationary _ point process .",
    "stationarity is a desirable property , allowing analytically tractable computations and , even more important , representing a key requirement for applying the definition of tc .",
    "even though the stationarity assumption has not really narrowed the range of obtainable insights , it poses some shortcomings to the analysis of wireless networks : + * infinite networks : * stationarity implies that the network is infinitely large as opposed to real deployments with a finite number of nodes . +",
    "* no border effects : * border effects are inherently neglected in infinite networks .",
    "however , border effects cause heterogeneity in the nodes capabilities depending on their location , i.e. , being dis-/connected , interference-/noise - limited , etc . + * infinite interference for free - space path loss : * for stationary node distributions in the plane and a path loss exponent @xmath2 , the interference is infinite almost sure ( a.s . ) @xcite , resulting in a tc of zero .",
    "more specifically , stationary models lose their accuracy as the path loss exponent decreases due to the fact that infinitely many nodes contribute to the interference . +",
    "* application of the tc : * as already mentioned , the tc applies only to stationary networks .",
    "when the node distribution is non - stationary , this metric must be modified to take into account heterogeneous node deployments .    in reality , wireless ad hoc networks always exhibit a heterogeneous node distribution .",
    "the most obvious example is perhaps when the nodes are distributed in a _ bounded _ region .",
    "in such a network , the interference situation near the center will significantly differ from that at the border .",
    "besides this simple example , more complex deployments are often found in practice , e.g. , wireless sensor networks created by airdrop @xcite , spontaneous formation of hot spots @xcite , etc .",
    "we extend the existing framework by relaxing the requirements on the node distribution , thereby allowing for _ isotropy only_. more specifically , we have the following results :    * the interference and outage statistics for slotted aloha with @xmath2 and @xmath3 are derived as a function of the receiver position and the spatial shape of the node distribution .",
    "we consider a path loss plus block fading model .",
    "as for the outage statistics , we focus on rayleigh fading .",
    "we show how known results for the stationary case arise from our results as special cases .",
    "* two global metrics , namely the differential tc and the average sum throughput , that take into account heterogeneous node deployments are proposed .",
    "while the former metric is a refinement of the tc , the latter quantifies the first order overall network efficiency .      stationary models with heterogeneous node deployment",
    "have already been investigated . specifically , poisson - cluster @xcite and matrn hard - core models @xcite",
    "have been studied , as they are well - suited for analyzing more sophisticated medium access control ( mac ) schemes .",
    "treated as _ general motion - invariant _ , these and similar models were further analyzed in @xcite in a unifying way . in @xcite , a non - stationary and isotropic node distribution was assumed for analyzing multi - antenna receivers . while the analysis showed that the shape of the spatial distribution has a considerable impact on link performance , the scenario was limited only to the case of the receiver located in the origin .",
    "we consider a wireless ad hoc network with nodes _ isotropically _ distributed in @xmath4 .",
    "the mac employed by the nodes is slotted aloha . in a randomly chosen slot ,",
    "some nodes wish to transmit a packet .",

    "when working with polar coordinates , we will use the notation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 . with @xcite",
