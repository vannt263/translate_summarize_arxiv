    "research activity in dissipation and decoherence of quantum systems has accelerated in the last two decades with developments in quantum information technologies , progress in detection and control of ultra - cold atom and ions , atom lasers and photonic band - gap materials as well as the research on the role of decoherence in quantum - to - classical transition  @xcite .",
    "theoretical efforts to investigate dissipation and decoherence phenomena due to interaction between a quantum system and its environment use either exact or perturbative treatments .",
    "while exact approaches can be used to treat a restricted class of problems for the whole interaction parameter range , the perturbative treatments can be applied to almost all problems , but only for a restricted range of parameters which is , generally , the weak coupling regime . a plethora of different perturbation based formalisms have been developed to treat such system - bath problems over the last six decades  @xcite .",
    "the most prominent among them are nakajima - zwanzig projector operator method , path - integral based influence functional method  @xcite , self - consistent hybrid schemes , monte carlo methods and hierarchical approaches  @xcite .",
    "most of the perturbative approaches express the equation of motion of the reduced density matrix of the system as a quantum master equation ( qme ) which contains second - order interaction terms .    one way to increase the validity range of the perturbative methods",
    "might be increasing the order of master equation .",
    "actually , it is shown by fleming and cummings  @xcite that an order-@xmath0 accuracy in the full - time solutions of master equations requires an order-@xmath1 master equation .",
    "a number of groups investigated the effects of the fourth and higher order terms in detail  @xcite .",
    "in particular , reichman et .",
    "have derived analytical expressions for dynamics of a harmonic oscillator in contact with various types of baths in the low temperature limit  @xcite .",
    "also , a physically sound fourth - order correction to redfield equation has been worked out by laird , budimir and skinner  @xcite .",
    "jang , cao and silbey  @xcite have derived a fourth - order qme in both time local and nonlocal forms for a general system hamiltonian and used it to study motion of a particle in a continuous potential field and the dynamics of a two - level system coupled to a bath .",
    "fourth - order corrections were found to cause a potential renormalization for the first problem while they introduced additional coherence for the later . in a series of papers , breuer et .",
    "@xcite have examined , in detail , the effects of including the fourth and higher order terms in time convolutionless master equation for the damped jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) , atom laser and the damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "it was found that at weak and moderate coupling , the fourth order qme was in good agreement with the exact solution for the jcm while for the intermediate coupling regime of atom lasers , one needs to include non - markovian as well as the fourth- and sixth - order terms to the master equation to adequately describe the dynamics of the system .",
    "singh and brumer investigated the validity of the of the second - order markovian redfield theory for reorganization energy and decay rates of photon autocorrelation functions in dimer systems  @xcite .",

    "mavros and voorhis considered fourth - order corrections to the memory kernel of the generalized master equation of the spin - boson problem and found that a numerically - exact solution was possible when the system - bath coupling is weak  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was found that the non - perturbative treatment of certain system - bath problems is equivalent to the second - order perturbative master equations and including higher than second order terms would be detrimental for such systems  @xcite .",
    "dissipative dynamics of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field , whether a coherent laser field or an incoherent blackbody radiation , have been examined by several groups  @xcite because of its relevance to damped transport in solid - state systems .",

    "@xcite have shown that dissipation of collective energy of a charged oscillator linearly coupled to a heat bath could be controlled by an external field .",
    "pachon and brumer  @xcite investigated the effect of blackbody radiation on the coherence of the dynamics of light - harvesting molecules in photosynthesis and showed that the blackbody radiation would not enhance the coherence of the system .",
    "ford , lewis , and oconnell derived a master equation for a charged oscillator weakly coupled to an electromagnetic field by using krylov averaging method which can be improved by including higher - order interaction terms in a systematical way  @xcite .",
    "the model has several interesting features , such as use of velocity - coupling for the system - environment interaction which is not as widely studied as the position - coupling and keeping the diamagnetic term of the interaction hamiltonian which leads to the nonzero third order contributions to the master equation which are absent for most of similar studies . in the current work ,",
    "our aim is two - fold ; we aim for exact analytical expressions for all coefficients of the derived master equation which are obtained in the limit of infinite environmental cutoff frequency in ref .",
    "our findings indicate that the exact treatment is crucial for the accurate high frequency behavior of the diffusion coefficients .",
    "second purpose of the present study is to derive analytical expressions for the fourth - order corrections to the master equation of the charged oscillator in an electromagnetic field and delineate the convergence range of interaction parameters .",
