    "as shown by gorbachev@xcite , @xmath2 , a double - layer graphene system has a strong coulomb drag resistivity with respect to gaalas heterostructures@xcite .",
    "likewise , phosphorene is a 2d material , however , with highly anisotropic energy dispersion in contrast to graphene and other 2d materials .",

    "we investigate the effect of band anisotropy on the coulomb drag resistivity in a double - layer electron system , consisting of two individual isolated layers which are coupled via coulomb interaction .",
    "we start from the expression for drag resistivity based upon the semiclassical boltzmann transport equation theory in the relaxation time approximation , and develop a general formalism , which includes the effect of anisotropic energy dispersion and rotationally misaligned 2d systems . as an example we apply this formalism to calculate coulomb drag resistivity in a double - layer phosphorene system(see figure [ fig1:phos ] ) .",
    "numerical results show a strong drag resistivity dependence on the band anisotropy .",
    "it indicates that the drag resistivity along bigger mass , i.e. , @xmath3 , has a larger value .",
    "furthermore , we discuss how the drag resistivity and its anisotropy ratio depend on the carrier density , inter - layer separation , rotation of layers and the choice of insulating substrate / spacer .",

    "the carriers are coupled through coulomb interaction and there is no tunneling between layers so the fermi energies and chemical potentials can be considered independently . the inter - layer coulomb interaction can cause momentum transfer from the electrons in the drive layer , layer 1 , to the carriers in the drag layer , layer 2 . in doing",
    "so it generates a potential difference across the layers . in fig.[fig1:phos](a ) we show a schematic of the drag setup with phosphorene layers as anisotropic 2d electron gases .",

    "one may notice that the acoustic plasmon mode calculated here is weaker than the optical one .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the coherence of acoustic mode is quickly vanished due to the thermal and disorder broadening effects because the @xmath71-@xmath72 spectrum of this mode is very close to the single particle excitation region .",

    "later on , we will employ lfc on top of rpa to calculate the drag resistivity .",
    "it is worth pointing out that considering a very thin double - layer phosphorene system when , at the same time , we assume there is no tunneling between the two layers , is not actually a problematic consideration because the space between layers is filled by a slim dielectric material . al@xmath76o@xmath77 and _",

    "we first derive a formula for the drag resistivity of a 2d anisotropic double - layer system with parabolic band structure and then solve it by making use of numerical methods .",

    "note that the integrand has significant weight in the @xmath93 interval , as is the case in conventional 2d electron gas @xcite but its values are larger along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "this is due to the greater effective mass of electrons in @xmath4 direction , which results in lower energies of the collective modes , and in this manner enhances the plasmons contributions @xcite .    the angular orientation of @xmath38 impacts the drag resistivity behavior considerably .",

    "while the diagonal drag resistivity matrix elements increase in similar manner with temperature , there are significant differences between the values .",
    "drag resistivity along the @xmath11 direction , @xmath101 , is smaller than the drag resistivity along the y direction , @xmath102 , at any temperatures of interest with a drag anisotropy ratio ( see inset graph ) , @xmath0 , which approximately changes from 2 up to about 3 .",
    "we believe that a higher - energy resonance along @xmath11 direction resulting from the smaller effective mass , as discussed before , accounts for this behavior .",

    "[ fig6 ] . here , we set @xmath104 and @xmath105 . it can be seen that as the angle of rotation increases , both diagonal elements of drag resistivity decrease considerably .",
    "this observation can be rationalized through the fact that by increasing the angle of rotation , one of the plasmonic branches is forced into the damped regime . as a result ,",
    "the contribution of plasmons to the coulomb drag phenomenon , which is known to be significant , decreases .",
    "when the angle of rotation is @xmath106 , the diagonal components of the drag resistivity tensor have zero values . in this configuration",

    "x_-axis of one layer lies along the _ y_-axis of the other layer , the values of diagonal elements , @xmath107 , become exactly equal to those of the off - diagonal elements for a system with no rotation .",
    "furthermore , our calculations show that when the layers are rotated with respect to one another the anisotropic effects can create an interesting non - zero transversal drag resistivity , @xmath108 , which is absent in isotropic materials at zero magnetic field .",
    "this observation can be fully understood by eq.([eq12]-[eq14 ] ) in which a misalignment of the laboratory and the layer axes gives rise to a non - zero value for the off - diagonal elements .",
    "this effect , however , may exist in a double - layer structures subjected to a perpendicularly applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "another interesting geometrical effect in a double - layer phosphorene structure comes from changing the inter - layer distance , which is presented in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "fig.[fig7](a ) is a 3d plot showing the variation of @xmath109 as a function of layer spacing and temperature .",
    "it can be observed that the peaks occur at intermediate temperatures where the plasmon contribution to the drag resistivity is significant , over the whole range of inter - layer distances .",
    "also the scaled drag resistivity decreases strongly when increasing the separation between two layers at all temperatures .",
    "one can attribute this behavior to the inter - layer interaction , which decays exponentially with the increasing distance between layers , and decreases due to acoustic modes shifting toward higher energies .",

    "we plot both scaled @xmath101 and @xmath102 as a functions of temperature for two different layer spacings : @xmath67 2 nm and 5 nm in fig.[fig7](b ) , which shows that the anisotropy ratio is less dependent on the inter - layer distance .",
    "the effect of electron density on the drag resistivity is also of interest ; hence , we illustrate it in fig.[fig8](a ) . as expected for double - layers systems , for which the electron density increases , the coulomb drag decreases and the resistivity peak moves toward higher temperature@xcite .",

    "the non - zero off - diagonal elements have not been reported before in a 2d coupled system without an applied magnetic field . according to the numerical results , both diagonal elements of anisotropic drag resistivity tensor increase with decreasing inter - layer separation and electron density .",
    "we show that , the anisotropic ratio varies effectively with the change of temperature and electronic density . to improve on rpa results at low electron density",

    "moreover , we have studied the effects of substrate / spacer on the anisotropic drag resistivity .",

    "these results provide qualitative insight into the impact that anisotropic band structure can have on drag resistivity , as an important transport quantity in a coupled 2d structure .",
