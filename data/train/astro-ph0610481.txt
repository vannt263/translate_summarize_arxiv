    "however , there is mounting evidence that grbs are _ not _ an unbiased tracer of the sfh  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the host galaxies of grbs have a distinct tendency to be subluminous  @xcite and metal - poor  @xcite .",
    "this has been demonstrated for grb hosts both locally  @xcite and at cosmological distances  @xcite , which suggests that low metallicity is a key ingredient in the production of a gamma - ray burst  @xcite .",
    "as we discuss in section  [ ratesect ] , a rapidly rotating star , as required in the collapsar model  @xcite , can retain much of its original mass and angular momentum if it is metal - poor  @xcite . an anti - correlation with metallicity",
    "would imply that the cosmological grb rate peaks at a higher redshift  @xcite , which now seems to be indicated by swift observations  @xcite",
    ". simply put : the metallicity of the universe _ decreases _ with redshift , which implies a _ stronger _ evolution of the grb rate density than would be expected from the sfh alone .",
    "when grbs are considered as the source of uhecr ( with identical cosmic - ray production per burst ) , the change in the cosmological cosmic - ray emissivity is simply determined by the burst rate history . in the metallicity - biased grb model ,",
    "this evolution is quite strong , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cr_evol ] , even exceeding that of models used in past cosmic - ray studies , which have traced quasar ( qso ) luminosities  @xcite or the sfh .",
    "we examine the effect of enhanced grb rate evolution on the expected flux of cosmogenic neutrinos , the measurement of which may provide the only way to break degeneracies between cosmic - ray models  @xcite .",
    "in addition to naturally explaining the abundance of high - redshift bursts observed by swift , this strong evolution leads to a measurable neutrino signal , improving the near - term prospects for assessing this scenario with upcoming ultrahigh energy neutrino detectors  @xcite .",
    "this result would still hold , in general , even if another mechanism is ultimately shown to account for the swift results through enhanced grb evolution .",
    "though we focus on the impact on cosmogenic neutrino production ( as dermer and holmes have also recently done for grb rates directly tracing several sfhs  @xcite ) , the metallicity - biased evolution model would also have implications for predictions of diffuse neutrino fluxes directly produced in grbs ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and their prospects for detection  @xcite .",
    "any treatment of cosmological cosmic - ray or neutrino production must account for source evolution .",
    "traditionally , the most commonly used cosmic - ray evolution models have tracked quasars  @xcite or the sfh  @xcite ( particularly in grb - related studies ) .",

    "observationally , all known supernova counterparts of grbs are type ic , with the implication that the dying star lacked an outer hydrogen / helium envelope  @xcite . the winds of wolf - rayet stars , which are typically the cause of the loss of this envelope , are known to increase in strength with stellar metallicity ( particularly iron )  @xcite .",
    "importantly , in this wind - induced loss process , angular momentum ( which is particularly important for forming jets  @xcite ) is lost along with mass  @xcite .",
    "this loss of angular momentum can be avoided if the progenitor has a very low metal content .",
    "in addition to having weaker winds , a rapidly - rotating , metal - poor massive star can avoid the production of an envelope altogether by completely mixing its interior , which results in the hydrogen being circulated into the core and burned  @xcite .",
    "this would be impossible if the star was not metal - poor , as stellar mixing is expected to be inhibited by a high metal content  @xcite .",
    "studies of grb hosts demonstrate that these galaxies tend to have a low metallicity  @xcite .",
    "compared to considerations of galactic luminosity observations alone  @xcite , direct spectroscopic measurements reveal metallicities that are significantly lower than expected  @xcite .",
    "while the metallicity of the grb progenitor may not be directly measured , the metallicity of the galaxy itself should be indicative .",
    "a connection between grbs and metallicity implies that the cosmological grb rate should be dependent upon the formation rate of metal - poor stars . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the universe is less metal - enriched than at the present  @xcite , resulting in an increase in the expected evolution of the grb rate density ( compared to the sfh ) , as shown by langer and norman  @xcite ( see also refs .",

    "this is consistent with estimates of this ratio  @xcite and can be used to calculate the increase in the absolute grb rate density ( of importance to cosmic - ray studies ) .",

    "a broad approach which utilizes all available means of observation will continue to be of great utility in unveiling the mysteries of gamma - ray bursts , particularly a relation to uhecr .",
    "further observations of grb host galaxies , along with those of core - collapse supernovae ( particularly type ib / ic ) , will provide invaluable information concerning grb progenitors .",
    "a systematic study of host metallicities would be important for firmly establishing the grb - metallicity anti - correlation , which , along with more accurate measurements of cosmic metallicity evolution  @xcite , would allow for improved grb rate - related calculations .",
    "direct observations of neutrinos from grbs ( e.g. , by icecube  @xcite or a km@xmath115 mediterranean detector  @xcite ) would confirm the acceleration of protons to high ( though not necessarily ultrahigh ) energies . in order to produce a detectable signal , a particularly strong burst , with measured gamma - ray fluence @xmath116 erg @xmath74 ( e.g. , the recent grbs 060928  @xcite and 061007  @xcite , which were observed to have fluences very near this threshold ) is required  @xcite . while the needed neutrino telescopes ( which may also reveal the sources of galactic cosmic rays  @xcite ) are still under construction , future observations by swift  @xcite should reveal similar bursts , in addition to determining the redshift - dependent grb rate with unprecedented precision .",
    "cosmogenic neutrinos present a unique tool to examine the grb - as - proton accelerator conjecture .",
    "while the cosmic - ray spectrum that will be measured by auger will allow for further assessments of the viability of prospective source models , the combined measurements of neutrinos and uhecr would break degeneracies between the various models , as discussed by seckel and stanev  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that strong source evolution can lead to observable cosmogenic neutrino signals ; however , a physically motivated model was lacking .",
    "the enhanced cosmogenic neutrino fluxes expected to result from strong grb evolution will allow for this model to be tested in a novel fashion .",
    "we have produced this strong evolution naturally through metallicity dependence , however , our general result is also applicable to _ any _ grb model that attempts to explain the observed swift redshift distribution with additional evolution .",
    "the sensitivity afforded by anita will allow for near - term examination which may either affirm or , if the expected flux is not found , place substantial constraints upon the model parameters . the lower detection threshold achieved by an arianna - like detector will allow for a realistic opportunity to discriminate between evolution models",
    ". measurements of fluxes consistent with that expected from grb evolution would provide compelling evidence for this model . as the relatively young field of particle astrophysics continues to progress",
    ", it is quite an exciting possibility that metals , once relegated to the realm of pure astronomy , may , in fact , hold the key to the production of the highest energy particles in the universe .    * * acknowledgments.**we would like to thank john beacom for many illuminating discussions ; shinichiro ando , john cairns , charles dermer , kris stanek , floyd stecker , casey watson , and eli waxman for helpful suggestions ; and baha balantekin , jim beatty , and terry walker for useful comments on the manuscript .",

    "in calculating the redshift distribution of gamma - ray bursts expected to be observable by swift , we follow the model of le and dermer  @xcite , using similar , but somewhat simplified , notation .",
    "this requires the assumption of a characteristic grb gamma - ray energy output ( @xmath117 ) and a duration in the grb rest frame ( @xmath118 ) , additionally assuming flat temporal and spectral burst profiles .",
    "each burst is assigned a jet opening angle , @xmath119 , which is selected from a power law distribution of the form @xmath120 , between an assumed @xmath121 and @xmath122 , normalized with @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "the observed energy flux from a grb at a luminosity distance , @xmath124 , then takes the form @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a bolometric correction factor , which accounts for the fraction of the burst spectrum within the energy band of the grb detector .",
    "solving this equation for the detector trigger sensitivity threshold , @xmath127 , yields the beaming angle , @xmath128 , required for detection . in effect , by assuming a constant @xmath117 we will use the opening angle as a proxy for the isotropic equivalent energy ( @xmath129 ) often used in grb studies ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for a comoving grb rate , @xmath130 ,",
    "the detectable grb rate is reduced to @xmath131 by beaming through angle , @xmath119 .",
    "we then find the detectable grb fraction as @xmath132}^{\\cos \\theta_{\\rm min } }    ( 1-\\cos \\theta)\\ , g_0\\ , ( 1-\\cos \\theta)^s \\ , d\\cos \\theta\\ ] ] @xmath133)^{2+s } - ( 1-\\cos \\theta_{\\rm min } ) ^{2+s}}{(1-\\cos \\theta_{\\rm max})^{1+s } - ( 1-\\cos \\theta_{\\rm min})^{1+s}}\\ , , \\label{a1}\\ ] ] we then compute the number of detected bursts per unit redshift as @xmath134 where @xmath135 takes into account cosmic time dilation , and the comoving volume element is given as @xmath136 substitution of eqs .  ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) agrees with the formulation presented in ref .",
    "we describe a simple , analytic method to compute the cosmogenic neutrino spectrum observed at earth , based upon the assumption that each daughter neutrino resulting from a photopion interaction receives @xmath137 of the parent proton energy .",
    "that is , a neutrino _ detected _ with energy , @xmath138 , was produced with energy , @xmath139 , at the source , from a parent proton which had energy , @xmath140 .",
    "we predict the observed ( @xmath9 ) neutrino spectrum , @xmath141,by integrating over the contributions to the flux from redshifts up to @xmath142 as @xmath143 where @xmath144 accounts for the fact that neutrinos are observed in a narrower energy bin then they were originally produced ( due to redshifting ) .",
    "evolution in the density of sources is accounted for through @xmath65 .",
    "the neutrino spectrum at production , @xmath145 , can be directly related to the cosmic - ray injection spectrum @xmath146 ( per unit comoving volume per unit energy , per unit time ) , through the conservation of the transferred energy , as @xmath147   \\right ) %   \\frac{de_p^{\\prime}}{de_\\nu^\\prime }   \\\\ % %   \\frac{dn_{\\nu}}{de_\\nu^\\prime } \\frac{de_\\nu^\\prime}{de_\\nu } & = &    20 \\,\\varphi(e_p^\\prime ) \\ ,   { \\cal s}\\ !",

    "<S> gamma - ray bursts , which are among the most violent events in the universe , are one of the few viable candidates to produce ultrahigh energy cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> recently , observations have revealed that grbs generally originate from metal - poor , low - luminosity galaxies and do not directly trace cosmic star formation , as might have been assumed from their association with core - collapse supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> several implications follow from these findings . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift distribution of observed grbs is expected to peak at higher redshift ( compared to cosmic star formation ) , which is supported by the mean redshift of the swift grb sample , @xmath0 . if grbs are , in fact , the source of the observed uhecr , then cosmic - ray production would evolve with redshift in a stronger fashion than has been previously suggested . </S>",
    "<S> this necessarily leads , through the gzk process , to an enhancement in the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos , providing a near - term approach for testing the gamma - ray burst  cosmic ray connection with ongoing and proposed uhe neutrino experiments . </S>"
