    "galaxy properties , such as morphological appearance and star formation rate ( sfr ) , strongly depend on the physical conditions of the environment",
    ". clusters of galaxies are dominated by red early - type galaxies with little star - forming activity , while the dominant population in the low - density field are blue late - type galaxies with significant star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the trend that the fraction of early - type galaxies increases with the local density is found even in poor groups ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological simulations predict that galaxies and groups are assembled into massive clusters moving along filamentary structures ( e.g.  millennium simulation ; @xcite ) .",
    "these surrounding regions are likely to play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies before becoming cluster galaxies .",
    "it is reported that ultraviolet - optical colours change sharply from blue to red when going from the field to dense environments ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , implying that at least for some of the red cluster galaxies , star - forming activity was quenched through environmental effects before entering the cluster region .",
    "moreover , galaxy groups , due to their low velocity dispersion , represent natural sites for the previous evolution of present - day cluster galaxies through tidal interactions @xcite , before the galaxies settled down in clusters .",
    "it is thus likely that at least part of the morphological transformation of cluster galaxies took place in earlier epochs in different conditions than the ones observed in present day clusters @xcite .",
    "this is called pre - processing  its relevance has still been debated in recent simulation results ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    there is a range of known physical mechanisms that could be responsible for altering galaxy morphology and/or sfr in clusters .",
    "ram pressure stripping @xcite , one of the most powerful effects , seems to have been observed directly in the virgo cluster @xcite , and simulations suggest that this process operates on short time - scales ( @xmath81 gyr , @xcite ) .",
    "other processes include strangulation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which cuts off the cold gas supply for ongoing star formation in cluster galaxies .",
    "galaxy mergers , tidal interactions , and harassment within the cluster potential @xcite are other effective processes in transforming observed properties of the galaxy populations .    when investigating the effect of the environment on the evolution of galaxies , early - type galaxies and transitional dwarf galaxies in poor groups are the most attractive targets",
    ". in general , dwarf galaxies with a shallow potential well are more sensitive to environmental effects than giant galaxies .",
    "recent studies reveal blue - cored early - type dwarf galaxies in various environments : clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , groups ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the field @xcite .",
    "theories recently evoked include that blue - cored early - type dwarf galaxies are the results of morphological evolution of late - type star forming galaxies by cluster environmental effects such as ram pressure stripping , harassment , tidal interaction or tidal stirring , and mergers ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that blue - cored early - type dwarf galaxies in fields are formed via merging of gas rich small irregular galaxies @xcite . while all these hypotheses are still debatable , comparing the presence and properties of these transitional dwarf galaxies in different environments is thus a promising approach to shed light on the specific transformation mechanisms .    in this context",

    "as hypothesized by @xcite , the presence of dwarf galaxies exhibiting star formation at their centre may be less related to direct external influence on the galaxy , but instead more governed by how much of the original gas reservoir remains available when a galaxy enters the cluster potential @xcite . in this context",

    "however , this process would be insignificant in groups of relatively low density .",
    "we adopt the concept of collision rate described by @xmath67 from @xcite to calculate how insignificant harassment is in the ursa major cluster as compared to the virgo cluster .",
    "@xmath68 is the number density , @xmath24 is the velocity dispersion of cluster , and @xmath69 is the cross - section of the target galaxy .",
    "the number density @xmath68 is calculated from the number of galaxies of m@xmath42 @xmath1 @xmath58 within 1.5 mpc of each cluster .",
    "the result confirms that the galaxies in the ursa major cluster are barely affected by multiple tidal influence with low efficiencies @xmath70 for harassment .    in group environments with relatively low velocity dispersion",
    ", it has been known that interactions between member galaxies are more frequent ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is supported by hi surveys of galaxies in the ursa major cluster in which a large fraction of galaxies show evidence of tidal interactions ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . from their extensive hi observations of 43 spiral galaxies , @xcite found that 10 galaxies show clear signs of galaxy - galaxy interactions . additionally , about half of the sample galaxies also exhibit features of warps or asymmetries in their hi surface density profile of discs .",
    "most recently , from a blind hi survey of the ursa major cluster , @xcite also found a fraction ( 33 per cent ) of candidates showing tidal interactions . furthermore , note that all three brightest s0 galaxies ( ngc 3998 , ngc 4026 , and ngc 4111 ) in the ursa major cluster show extended hi filaments , indicative of tidal gas stripping from the disc of nearby companions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also fig . [ f12 ] of @xcite for the extended hi envelope around ngc 4026 and ngc 4111 ) . all of these results provide direct evidence of considerable frequency of interactions between galaxies in the ursa major cluster and then support the view that tidal interactions may be the dominant mechanism that transforms late - type dwarf galaxies into early - types in group environments .    in this context , tidally induced star formation of dirrs and their subsequent evolution should be the most plausible scenario related with the formation of the blue - cored early - type dwarfs in the ursa major cluster . in order to compare interaction probabilities",
    ", we calculate the perturbation parameter @xmath71 for the galaxies in the ursa major cluster and the virgo cluster .",
    "the @xmath71 value is defined by @xcite as @xmath72 where r is the size of the galaxy , d@xmath73 is the projected distance between the galaxy and the perturber , and m@xmath74 and m@xmath73 are the apparent magnitudes of the primary and perturber galaxies , respectively . the galaxy with the largest @xmath71 value is chosen to be the perturber for the primary galaxy .",
    "this parameter means the ratio between the internal and tidal forces acting on the galaxy by a possible perturber .",
    "the median @xmath71 values for virgo and ursa major early - type galaxies are @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with standard deviations of 1.21 and 1.47 , respectively .",
    "their ratio is large ( 10@xmath77 @xmath8 0.008 ) .",
    "however , if we assume that interactions between the primary and the perturber start in both clusters at the same time , the average interaction time - scale of galaxies in the ursa major cluster will be five times longer than virgo galaxies since velocity dispersion of virgo cluster ( 715 km s@xmath14 ) is larger than that of ursa major cluster ( 151 km s@xmath14 ) . while this longer interaction time could make both clusters more similar",
    ", it is still not explained that the fraction of blue - cored early - type dwarfs in the ursa major cluster is larger than that of virgo cluster .",
    "there is one possibility might solve this problem .",
    "we hypothesize that the blue - cored early - type dwarf galaxies could be considered as possible transitional objects which are on the way to red early - type galaxies from the late - type progenitors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although they are formed via tidal interactions in groups or clusters at the same rate , they have a different evolutionary path as a function of their mass or brightness and the environments where they were formed . in a severe environment like virgo",
    ", less massive galaxies with a shallow potential well lose gas in their centres and will passively evolve to be seen as de / ds0 . in dense environments , only massive galaxies with a deep potential",
    "well keep their gas in their centres , although losing it in their outer disk . on the other hand , in a less dense environment like ursa major , both massive and less massive galaxies",
    "keep their gas in their centre .",
    "consequently , ursa major possesses a much larger fraction of blue - cored early - type dwarfs than virgo .",
    "the above hypothesis is supported by fig .",
    "blue - cored early - type dwarfs in the virgo cluster are located on the brighter magnitude and higher density region than those in the ursa major cluster .",
    "we conclude that blue - cored early - type dwarfs are found ubiquitously in all environments including the field ( e , g . , @xcite ) while their frequencies vary with environment and may probe the strength of environment . in a forthcoming paper ( kim et al .  in preparation .",
    ") , we will investigate blue - cored early - type dwarf candidates in the field environment in comparison with those in cluster ( e.g. , virgo ) and group ( e.g. , ursa major ) environments , which will allow to probe their formation and evolutionary path .",
