    "in the last several years , the measured electronic properties of cuprate superconductors have shown considerable evidence of inhomogeneities .",
    "for example , spatial variations of the superconducting energy gap and of the local density of states spectrum have been observed in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments @xcite .",
    "there have also been a number of reports of magnetic and charge ordering in these materials , which also indicate inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "other studies of cuprates have shown that electronic states within certain energy ranges show checkerboard - like spatial modulations  @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical approaches have been developed to model these inhomogeneities @xcite .",

    "we use the approach of ref .   to explore how the spectral function of a d - wave superconductor is affected by gap inhomogeneities and thermal fluctuations .",
    "the spectral function of cuprate superconductors has been studied theoretically by a number of groups , though most have omitted the effects of quenched inhomogeneities .",
    "for example , wakabayashi _",
    "et al._@xcite used a weak - coupling bcs theory combined with a green s function approach to explain the narrow quasiparticle peak at the gap edge , which has been observed by arpes experiments in overdoped cuprates along the antinodal direction .",
    "et al._@xcite , using a nambu formalism , have studied a model which includes pairing fluctuation effects , and which accounts for some features of the single - particle spectral function as observed in certain cuprates .",
    "zacher _ et al._@xcite have used a cluster perturbation technique to compute the single - particle spectral function of the @xmath15-@xmath16 and hubbard models , and to study stripe phases in the cuprates .",
    "et al._@xcite have studied a hubbard model for ( uniform ) projected @xmath2-wave states .",
    "they used a variational monte carlo technique in which one of the variational parameters is the magnitude @xmath3 of the pairing field , and find that @xmath3 , as a function of doping , scales with the @xmath17 hump and @xmath18 as observed in arpes experiments .    in another recent work , using a generalization of bcs theory , chen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found a sharpening of the peaks in the spectral function as @xmath1 is reduced below @xmath19 , similar to what we find as discussed below .",

    "hotta et al.@xcite have used a self - consistent t - matrix approximation to study a model for s and d wave superconductivity at finite @xmath1 .",
    "they found a gap in both the single - particle density of states and the spectral function even above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath20 ; the energy scale for the pseudogap is found to be the cooper - pair binding energy .",
    "more recently , mayr _",
    "et al._@xcite have introduced an extended hubbard model , which includes both superconductivity and antiferromagnetism ; they found that quenched disorder is a necessary ingredient for that model to reproduce the double branch , or split band , observed in angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments on la@xmath21sr@xmath22cuo@xmath23 .",
    "finally , a model to study how @xmath0 is affected by thermal fluctuations of the phase , but not the amplitude , of the superconducting order parameter has been treated by eckl et al .",
    "@xcite for homogenous systems .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a simple model for @xmath24 .",
    "this model can exhibit a split peak near @xmath7 , but only for certain parameter choices which are unlikely to be realized experimentally .",
    "our model consists of a bcs superconductor with @xmath2-wave symmetry , where the pairing field ( given by the superconducting order parameter ) is inhomogeneous , and is also subject to thermal amplitude and phase fluctuations at finite @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that those thermal fluctuations are governed by a discretized ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy functional . to compute the spectral function , we use exact numerical diagonalization of the bcs hamiltonian on a finite lattice and average over many different configurations of the thermally fluctuating superconducting order parameter as obtained using the monte carlo technique .",
    "thermal averages are obtained by averaging over these configurations .",
    "inhomogeneities are introduced in our model phenomenologically .",
    "the atomic lattice is subdivided into cells , which we call xy cells , of size @xmath25 atomic sites ; within each such cell , we assume @xmath3 to be constant .",

    "this broadening is most pronounced at @xmath33 . for a sufficiently large ratio @xmath34 of the large to the small gap",
    ", we find that @xmath0 near @xmath35 shows two peaks rather than one ( `` split band regime '' ) . otherwise , we find a single peak which is broadened by disorder .",

    "@xcite also show a double peak , there are several reasons to believe that this split peak is not caused by the kind of inhomogeneities we consider here .",
    "this point is discussed further below . at finite @xmath1 , we find that , near @xmath7 , the originally sharp coherence peaks of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath36 broaden and shift to lower energies with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this broadening is similar to that found in the calculations of eckl _ et al . _",

    "we use the gl form for convenience , and because we expect that it will exhibit the qualitative behavior that would be seen in a more accurate functional - that is , the effects of inhomogeneities would be qualititatively the same in the gl model as in a more accurate model containing additional powers of @xmath108 . to obtain @xmath104 for a given distribution of the @xmath86 s , we diagonalize the hamiltonian ( 1 ) for that configuration , then obtain @xmath0 using eq .  ( 6 ) .",

    "( @xmath215 mev ) , this would represent a @xmath27 of around @xmath216ev .",
    "since the average value of @xmath27 in most of the cuprate superconductors is @xmath217ev , it seems most unlikely that random spatial fluctuations in @xmath27 , due to quenched disorder , could produce such a large gap locally . furthermore ,",
    "even with such large quenched fluctuations in the gap , we need a _ bimodal _",
    "gap distribution to obtain a split spectral function - equally large quenched fluctuations , but with a continuous distribution due to quenched disorder , would probably not give rise to a split spectral function .",
    "therefore , it seems very improbable that our model could account for the second branch in the dispersion relation reported in ref .",
    "however , our results should give a reasonable picture of how quenched gap inhomogeneities affect @xmath0 in a d - wave superconductor over a range of parameters .",
