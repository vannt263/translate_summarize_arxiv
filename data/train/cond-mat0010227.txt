    "the reported discovery of the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity by tallon et .",
    "@xcite has attracted a great deal of interest , since ferromagnetism breaks the degeneracy of spin - up and spin - down partners of cooper pairs.@xcite the experiments demonstrated that rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 exhibits ferromagnetic ordering of ru moments below a curie temperature , @xmath7 133  k , and becomes superconducting at a lower temperature , @xmath6 up to 40  k. from a theoretical point of view , pickett et .",
    "al.@xcite calculated the electronic structure of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 and discussed how the superconductivity , which may behave as a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinniko ( fflo ) type superconductor , can coexist with the ferromagnetism .",
    "however , the x - ray determined crystal structure used in their calculations was different from that recently determined by neutron diffraction@xcite - and so they did not consider the structural distortions ( i.e. , oxygen rotations ) in the ruo@xmath2 octahedra .    the crystal structure of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 with a p4/mbm tetragonal space group , determined by the neutron experiment,@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( a ) .",
    "this is a structure similar to that of yba@xmath0cu@xmath8o@xmath9 , where y , ba and cu ( chain atom ) are replaced by gd , sr and ru , respectively .",
    "ru lies at a six - coordinated position in the octahedron composed of six neighboring oxygens ( four o@xmath10 and two o@xmath11 ) , while cu lies in a five - coordinated position ( four o@xmath12 and one o@xmath11 ) .",
    "since the interatomic distance of cu - o@xmath11 ( 2.190   ) is much larger than that of ru - o@xmath11 ( 1.912   ) , the cu has a rather weak interaction with o@xmath11 .",
    "thus , this may yield a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electronic structure of the cu - o@xmath12 layer .",
    "the ruo@xmath2 octahedra are rotated by about 14@xmath13 around the c - axis to fill the space more efficiently , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( b ) .",
    "these rotations may lead to a significant reduction in the @xmath14-electron bandwidth due to a deviation of the angle ru - o@xmath10-ru from 180@xmath13 , and so the magnetism of ru may be strongly perturbed by the structural distortion .",
    "hence , it is necessary to again investigate the stability of the magnetic structure in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 by first - principles calculations with the precise crystal structure parameters .    with the experimentally determined structure,@xcite our highly precise first - principles full - potential linearized augmented plane wave(flapw ) calculations@xcite on three different magnetic orderings demonstrate@xcite that antiferromagnetic ordering of the ru moments is energetically favorable over the previously proposed ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "furthermore , in agreement with our result , recent neutron diffraction experiments by lynn et .",
    "al.@xcite observed antiferromagnetic ru ordering . in the present paper ,",
    "we report the first - principles results on rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 , and discuss the magnetic and electronic structures and their implications for the coexistence of superconductivity .",
    "in our flapw calculations , we employed the experimentally determined room temperature crystal structure.@xcite for the magnetic structures , we assumed three kinds of magnetic orderings for ru and gd moments as depicted in fig.2 : ( a ) a fm structure with ferromagnetic orderings for both ru and gd moments ; ( b ) an afm - i structure with a c - type antiferromagnetic ordering of ru moments and a ferromagnetic ordering of gd moments ( more precisely , a ferrimagnetic structure ) ; and ( c ) an afm - ii structure with c - type antiferromagnetic orderings for both ru and gd moments .",
    "( note that the symmetry of both the afm - i and afm - ii structures makes two inequivalent sublattice sites for ru , o@xmath11 and cu . )",
    "while the recent experiment@xcite revealed antiferromagnetic alignments for both ru and gd moments with g - type orderings , in which nearest neighbors of ru ( gd ) moments along all three crystallographic axes are coupled antiferromagnetically , we employed the c - type antiferromagnetic ordering in order to reduce the large computational effort this would entail",
    ". ( the g - type ordering requires doubling the unit cell of the c - type ordering . )",
    "this is justified because the moment alignment along the c - axis may be less important than that along the a - axis since the distance between the neighboring ru ( gd ) atoms in the c - axis ( 11.56   ) is significantly greater than that in the a - axis ( 3.84   ) .",
    "thus , the assumption of c - type magnetic structure would not alter the results or the insight obtained .",
    "calculations were performed based on the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) with the hedin - lundquist exchange correlation@xcite , in which the core states are treated fully relativistically and the valence states are treated semi - relativistically .",
    "although the effects of electronic correlation in a strongly correlated system may be taken into account within a scheme such as lda+u , rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 shows metallic character even in the ruo layer , as will be presented in sec .",
    "iv , which causes that effect to be weak . hence ,",
    "while our results are restricted within lda , they may be sufficient to discuss qualitative conclusions .",
    "the lapw basis functions were used with a cut - off , @xmath15 a.  u. , corresponding to about 1800 plane waves .",
    "muffin - tin ( mt ) sphere radii in a.  u. were chosen as : 2.4 ( ru ) , 2.5 ( sr ) , 2.5 ( gd ) , 2.2 ( cu ) and 1.2 ( o ) . inside the spheres",
    ", the angular momentum expansion was truncated at @xmath16 for wave functions , charge density and potential .",
    "integrations were performed over a first brilliouin zone using 126 special @xmath17-points , corresponding to 16 , 16 and 32 @xmath17-points in the irreducible brilliouin zone for the fm , afm - i and afm - ii structures , respectively .",
    "the calculated magnetic moment of each atom inside the mt sphere for the fm , afm - i and afm - ii structures is given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the moment of gd is close to 7  @xmath18 - as expected . in the afm - i structure ,",
    "the magnitude of the ru , o@xmath11 and cu magnetic moments with opposite spin directions is slightly different since the ferromagnetically ordered gd moments break the symmetry of the two sublattice sites . among all three structures , the ru magnetic moments are almost of the same magnitude , about 1.55  @xmath18 .",
    "note that since the magnitude depends on the mt sphere radius , the rather large mt sphere radius ( 2.4  a.u . )",
    "we used gives rather large values .",
    "however , the experimental value ( 1.18  @xmath18 ) of the ru magnetic moment determined by neutron diffraction@xcite is smaller than our results .",
    "this may be attributed to possible canted antiferromagnetic ordering of the ru magnetic moments , for which further investigations are necessary .",
    "the induced magnetic moments of o@xmath11 and o@xmath10 are very sensitive to the ru magnetic structures , while the cu and o@xmath12 moments are negligibly small .",
    "total energies for all three fm , afm - i and afm - ii structures are also given in table  [ table1 ] . from a comparison between the fm and afm - i structures",
    ", we found that an antiferomagnetic ordering of ru moments is favored over the ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the total energy difference , 22.5  mev / ru - atom , between both fm and afm - i corresponds to the nel temperature ( @xmath19 ) of 73  k , crudely estimated by mean field theory with @xmath20 .",
    "although the calculated @xmath19 is lower than the experimentally determined @xmath19 , 136  k,@xcite our prediction for the magnetic structure is consistent with the experiment by lynn et .",
    "al.@xcite further , we found that an antiferromagnetic ordering of the gd moments ( afm - ii ) reduces the total energy , but only by 2.3  mev / gd - atom , from that of the afm - i structure , corresponding @xmath21  k ( assumed @xmath22 ) , which is approximately in agreement with the observed low nel temperature , 2.5  k,@xcite for the gd moment alignment .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the total density of states ( dos ) and partial dos of each atom for the fm , afm - i and afm - ii structures .",
    "the peaks at 2  ev above the fermi level ( @xmath23 ) and 3  ev below @xmath23 in the total dos for all three structures correspond to gd 4@xmath24 states which are strongly localized , and their states do not significantly affect the electronic structure around @xmath23 . an exchange splitting in the total dos in the afm - i structure is due to the ferromagnetism of gd , but the difference between majority and minority spin dos is very small except in the region of the localized gd 4@xmath24 states . note that the total dos for all three structures shows metallic character .    from the partial dos in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we can see that the magnetism of ru is dominated by antibonding @xmath3 states , and the major o@xmath10 and o@xmath11 peaks correlate strongly with those of ru . in contrast , the partial dos for cu @xmath14 and o@xmath12 @xmath25 states , which are strongly hybridized , are insensitive to the magnetism of ru .",
    "the exchange splitting of the ru @xmath14 states for all three structures is about 1  ev , while the induced exchange splitting in the cu @xmath14 states is smaller by two orders of magnitude - 0.01 to zero ev .",
    "our results for the exchange splitting and magnetic moments of the cu @xmath14 states is smaller , even in the fm case , than those in the undistorted fm case reported by weht et .",
    "al.@xcite this may be due to the differernt structure parameters employed in the two calculations .",
    "the fact that the ru - cu distance , 4.10  , in our calculations is larger than in their case , 3.58  , results in a rather weak magnetic interaction and leads to smaller exchange splittings and magnetic moments in the cu @xmath14 states .",
    "futher , the relative atomic position of o@xmath11 between the ru and cu may be sensitive to the magnetism.@xcite however , the exchange splitting and the magnetic moments in the cu @xmath14 are quite small .",
    "the small exchange coupling is due to the unique electronic structure of the layered ru @xmath3 and cu @xmath4 states separated by @xmath25 orbitals of o@xmath11 , as discussed by pickett et .",
    "al.,@xcite and is roughly valid regardless of the magnetic ordering of ru moments : ru @xmath3 states couple only to the @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbitals of o@xmath11 , but do not couple to the cu - o @xmath28 states .",
    "we focus here on the magnetism of ru .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the projected dos in real space for ru @xmath14 , o@xmath10 @xmath25 and o@xmath11 @xmath25 states for the fm , afm - i and afm - ii structures .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30-axes for the ru ( o@xmath10 ) dos are chosen as directions to the neighboring o@xmath10 ( ru ) site and c - axis , respectively .",
    "compared to the dos of the fm structure presented by weht et .",
    "al.,@xcite which did not include a structural distortion due to ruo@xmath2 rotations , our calculated majority @xmath31 states ( cf . ,",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) ) are more localized below @xmath23 , due to deviation of the angle ru - o@xmath10-ru from 180@xmath13 and the elongation of ru - o@xmath10 bonds by the ruo@xmath2 rotations .",
    "this results in the @xmath31 states being almost fully occupied , and in a depletion of the majority spin hybridization channel at @xmath23 . in the afm - i and afm - ii structures , the majority @xmath31 and @xmath32 states on a ru site can hybridize with the minority spin states on neighboring ru sites through o@xmath10 @xmath27 and o@xmath10 @xmath33 orbitals , respectively , by the superexchange mechanism .",
    "the @xmath32 states also couple strongly to the o@xmath11 @xmath34 orbitals .",
    "the charge configuration of ru seems to be @xmath35 with a high spin state , namely close to ru@xmath36 .",
    "generally , the superexchange interaction between fully occupied @xmath35 states in nearest neighbor magnetic ions tends to be stabilized with an antiferromagneticic ordering of their moments . on the other hand ,",
    "the double exchange mechanism through itinerant electrons may not be favorable , since the majority @xmath3 states are strongly localized and almost fully occupied - as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetism of ru in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 is determined by the superexchange mechanism .",
    "the calculated band structures for rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 are shown along high symmetry directions in fig .",
    "the majority and minority spin states in afm - ii are degenerate due to the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic ru and gd moment alignments , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the afm - i structure",
    ", a small difference between majority and minority spin states was observed due to the assumed ferromagnetic gd moments , but its difference is negligibly small .",
    "the band structure of afm - i is practically the same as that observed in the afm - ii structure .",
    "the bands around @xmath23 for all three structures arise from the ru - o@xmath10-o@xmath11 bands ( solid light circles ) and cu - o@xmath12 bands ( solid dark circles ) . in the afm - i and afm - ii structures , there are three bands crossing @xmath23 - as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( c ) .",
    "they arise from a ru - o@xmath10 band with antibonding @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) orbitals , and two cu - o@xmath12 bands composed of antibonding @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) obitals with even and odd symmetry derived by a mirror operation in the cu - o@xmath12 bilayer .",
    "the two cu - o@xmath12 bands are almost the same as those in the fm structure .",
    "as expected from the structural similarity between rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath8o@xmath9 , their band structures arising from cu - o@xmath12 layers are close to each other , showing a strong two - dimensionality .",
    "the energy states are little changed upon going from @xmath41 to z along the @xmath30 direction . also , the strong @xmath40 hybridization leads to a wide bandwidth of 10.1 , 9.7 and 9.7  ev for fm , afm - i and afm - ii , respectively .",
    "these values are almost the same as observed in the 2d @xmath5 bands in yba@xmath0cu@xmath8o@xmath9 , 9.0  ev.@xcite the slightly larger bandwidth may be due to the smaller interatomic distance ( 1.93   ) of cu - o@xmath12 bonds and the smaller buckling angle ( 5.7@xmath13 ) in the cuo@xmath0 plane of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 , compared with those of yba@xmath0cu@xmath8o@xmath9 ( 1.95   and 7.8@xmath13 ) .    from a comparison of band structures between the fm and afm - i structures , we found that the antibonding @xmath40 bands are not influenced significantly by the magnetism of ru except around the m point in the zone . around m , where they possess small components of cu @xmath42 character ,",
    "the cu @xmath4 states couple to the ru @xmath4 states through the o@xmath11 @xmath33 orbitals , but do not couple to ru @xmath3 states .",
    "therefore , the quite small exchange splitting in the @xmath40 states may be mediated through a more indirect coupling path with o@xmath11-o@xmath10 .",
    "note that the cu @xmath3 states are coupled to the ru @xmath3 states through the o@xmath11 @xmath43 orbitals , but the cu @xmath3 states are almost fully occupied , so the hybridization channel at @xmath23 is depleted .",
    "the calculated fermi surfaces ( fs ) at @xmath44 for the afm - ii structure are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) . for convenience ,",
    "a sketch of the fs is given in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ]  ( b ) , which makes for an easier comparison with the high @xmath6 results .",
    "two closed fs centered at the zone corner arising from the cu - o@xmath12 bands and a closed fs from the ru - o@xmath10 band , are found .",
    "the inner and outer fs ( 1 and 2 in fig .  [ fig6 ] ( b ) ) correspond to antibonding @xmath40 states with even and odd symmetry under @xmath30 reflection , respectively .",
    "note that the fs has no exchange splitting , due to the antiferromagnetic ordering of the ru and gd moments , implies that the superconductivity need no longer be of the fflo type - in contrast to the fm case.@xcite a folding in @xmath17-space due to the antiferromagnetic ordering of ru makes intersections between the bands ( a , b and c in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( b ) ) , showing the band - band interaction .",
    "as observed in the undistorted fm,@xcite the fs clearly demonstrates similar nesting structures with those in the other high @xmath6 cuprate superconductors@xcite ; these will give rise to singularities in the generalized susceptibility , and lead to possible anomalous behavior of the electronic properties .",
    "further , the fs ( 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( b ) ) , derived from ru @xmath31 states , shows a pocket of electrons centered at @xmath41 , which may lead to the superconductivity in the cu - o@xmath12 layer with hole - doped character , as observed in experiments@xcite    in contrast , the fs in the fm structure is complicated due to the ru - o@xmath10 bands .",
    "the majority spin ru @xmath32 bands ( 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) ) become more dispersive and cross at @xmath23 compared to the afm - i structure , which makes an additional hole pocket centered at @xmath41 , leading to be a less hole - doped character in cu - o@xmath12 layers . hence",

    "we have performed first - principles flapw calculations to investigate magnetic structures in superconducting rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "contrary to the previously ferromagnetic rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 structure proposed from susceptibility experiments@xcite and first - principles calculations,@xcite we found that antiferromagnetic ordering of the ru moments is energetically favored over ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "our results are consistent with those of a recent neutron diffraction experiment,@xcite in which the antiferromagnetic ordering of ru moments was predominantly observed .",
