    "the use of distinct ensembles in equilibrium statistical mechanics , in which systems are described by a given hamiltonian , is a well established concept @xcite .",
    "there is a standard procedure for passing from a given ensemble to another . for nonequilibrium systems @xcite ,",
    "on the other hand , this procedure can not be used , since they are not described by a hamiltonian and therefore , their probability distribution are not known a priori . in most cases",
    "nonequilibrium systems are defined in a constant rate ensemble , ( which we call ordinary version ) , but the possibility of using another ensemble was put forward by ziff and brosillow @xcite when they used a constant coverage ensemble in their study of an irreversible surface - reaction model .",
    "subsequently , tom and de oliveira @xcite introduced the contact process in the ensemble of constant number of particles .    in the conserved contact process ( ccp )",
    "@xcite , a particle chosen at random leaves its place and jumps to one of the many active sites of the lattice .",
    "the ccp displays properties that in the thermodynamic limit are identical to the ordinary contact process .",
    "hilhorst and van wijland @xcite provided a proof of the equivalence between the constant rate and the constant particle number ensembles for the contact process .",
    "later , de oliveira @xcite extended the proof for any reaction process that annihilate one particle @xcite .",
    "sometimes the use of the conserved version is more appropriate than the ordinary version as for example in the study of a first - order transition .",
    "this advantage has been exploited by ziff and brosillow @xcite , loscar and albano @xcite that studied hysteretic effects in a model that describes the co+no reaction , and more recently by fiore and de oliveira @xcite .    here",
    ", we analyze in the ensemble of constant particle number one - dimensional models whose ordinary versions have been previously studied .",
    "these models are : the pair - annihilation contact model ( pam ) @xcite , the triplet - annihilation contact model ( tam ) @xcite , and the pair contact process ( pcp ) @xcite . in these models ,",
    "a cluster of particles is spontaneously annihilated and particles are catalytically created in active sites .",
    "active sites are empty sites surrounded by a neighborhood of particles .",
    "consider a site @xmath1 of regular lattice .",
    "to each site @xmath1 of the lattice we attach an occupation variable @xmath2 which takes the values @xmath3 or @xmath4 according whether the site @xmath1 is empty or occupied by a particle . in the constant rate ensemble ,",
    "the usual process is composed of creation of a single particle ( 0 @xmath5 1 ) with transition rate @xmath6 , and annihilation of a cluster of @xmath0 particles in a row ( 111 ... 1@xmath5000 ... 0 ) with transition rate @xmath7 .",
    "the transition rate @xmath8 is the probability per unit time of creating a particle at the site @xmath1 .",
    "the transition rate @xmath9 is the probability per unit time of annihilating a particle at the site @xmath1 .",
    "the total transition rate for these two reaction processes is given by @xmath10 the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 will be defined according to the specific model and they depending on the local configuration of particles .",
    "the quantities @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which we call strengths of the annihilation and creation process , are parameters that gives the weight of each subprocess .",
    "diffusion of particles consists of a particle hopping to its nearest neighbor .",
    "in diffusive models , the diffusion of particles and the reaction process occur with probability @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .    in the ensemble of constant particle number ,",
    "the jumping process and the diffusion of particles are chosen with probabilities @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . in the hopping step , an occupied site @xmath19 and its nearest next neighbor @xmath20 interchange their occupation variables , whereas in the jumping step , @xmath0 adjacent particles leave their places and arrive at @xmath0 active sites .",
    "thus , in the ensemble of constant particle number , both the creation and annihilation of particles are replaced by @xmath0 jumping process .",
    "in the construction of conserved models we have to be concerned only with the creation and annihilation processes since the diffusion process already conserves the particle number . in the case of processes that annihilate a pair of particles ( pam and pcp ) , the jumping process occurs with rate @xmath21 . in the case of annihilation of a triplet of neighboring particles ( tam )",
    ", it occurs with rate @xmath22 .    to demonstrate that this conserved dynamics is equivalent to the ordinary dynamics described by eq .",

    "let us consider the specific case of models that annihilate two particles . in this case ,",
    "two particles , belonging to the neighborhood of site @xmath1 , chosen at random , jump to two distinct active sites , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , also chosen at random .",
    "the jumping process occurs with rate @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of sites of the lattice .",
    "let us evaluate the total rate @xmath27 in which particles leave the neighborhood of site @xmath1 . in the thermodynamic limit , the sums @xmath28 and @xmath29 approach , by the law of large numbers , the averages @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "therefore we have @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , the total rate at which a particle arrives at the site @xmath23 is @xmath33 and the total rate at which a particle gets to the site @xmath24 is @xmath34 .    comparing these results with the rate ( [ rateord ] )",
