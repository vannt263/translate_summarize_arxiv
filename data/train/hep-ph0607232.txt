    "implications of the observed pattern of neutrino mass and mixing ( with two large angles ) for fundamental physics are still an open question .",
    "this pattern has not yet led to a better understanding of the origins of the neutrino mass as well as fermion masses and mixing in general .",
    "in contrast , it made the situation more complicated and more intriguing  @xcite . in this connection , any hint from data and any empirical relation should be taken seriously and analyzed in details .",
    "in fact , one feature has been realized recently that ( if not accidental ) may lead to a substantially different approach to the underlying physics .",
    "namely , the sums of the mixing angles of quarks and leptons for the 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 generations agree with @xmath8 within @xmath9 . in other words ,",
    "the quark and lepton mixings sum up to maximal mixing @xcite : _ 12 + _ c ,   _",
    "23 + _ cb .",

    "( [ qlcrel ] ) which are called the quark - lepton complementarity ( qlc ) relations , the quark and lepton mixings are complementary to the maximal mixing .",
    "( a possibility that the lepton mixing responsible for the solar neutrino conversion equals maximal mixing minus @xmath10 was first mentioned in @xcite , and corrections to the bimaximal mixing @xcite from the ckm type rotations were discussed in @xcite . )    for various reasons it is difficult to expect exact equalities ( [ qlcrel ] ) .",
    "however certain correlations clearly show up :    * the 2 - 3 leptonic mixing is close to maximal because the 2 - 3 quark mixing , @xmath12 , is very small ; * the 1 - 2 leptonic mixing deviates from maximal substantially because the 1 - 2 quark mixing ( _ i.e. _ , the cabibbo angle ) is relatively large .",
    "if not accidental coincidence , the qlc relations imply  @xcite    \\(i ) a kind of quark - lepton symmetry or quark - lepton unification which propagates the information about mixing from the quark sector to the lepton sector .",
    "\\(ii ) existence of some additional structure which produces maximal or bi - maximal mixing .    even within this context one expects some deviations from exact quark - lepton complementarity due to    - broken quark - lepton symmetry ,    - renormalization group ( rg ) effects .",
    "+ there is a number of attempts to reproduce the qlc relations on the basis of already existing ideas about fermion mass matrices @xcite .",
    "usually they lead to too small deviations of @xmath0 from @xmath13 , and therefore require further corrections or deviations from the bi - maximal mixing or from the cabibbo mixing already in the lowest order .",
    "so , in the majority of the models proposed so far , an approximate qlc relation appears as a result of an interplay of different independent factors or as a sum of several independent contributions . in these cases the qlc relation seems to be accidental .",
    "there are few attempts to construct a consistent gauge model which explains the qlc relations .",
    "the simplest possibility is the @xmath14 model that implements the quark - lepton symmetry in the most straightforward way @xcite .",
    "phenomenology of schemes with qlc relations has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the relation ( [ qlcrel ] ) is realized at some high energy scale , @xmath15 , of flavor physics and quark - lepton unification",
    ". therefore one should take into account the renormalization group effects on the qlc relations when confronting them with the low energy data .",
    "in fact , it was marked in @xcite that in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the corrections are typically positive but negative @xmath4 can be obtained from the rg effects in presence of non - zero 1 - 3 mixing .",
    "also threshold corrections due to some new scale of physics , such as the low scale supersymmetry , can produce a negative shift of @xmath0 , thus enhancing its deviation from @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the cabibbo mixing can be transmitted to the lepton sector in a more complicated way ( than via the quark - lepton symmetry ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath16 may turn out to be a generic parameter of the theory of fermion masses - the `` quantum '' of flavor physics .",
    "therefore it may appear in various places : mass ratios , mixing angles .",
    "one can consider the cabibbo angle as an expansion parameter for mixing matrices @xcite .    in this paper we study in details the rg effects in the qlc scenario where the bi - maximal mixing is generated by the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we calculate corrections to the angles both in the standard model ( sm ) and mssm .",
    "we analyze the dependence of the corrections on various parameters and obtain bounds on the parameters from consistency condition with qlc . in particular , we find regions where the corrections are negative .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we formulate the scenario and comment on parameterization dependence of the qlc relations as well as confront the relations with experimental data . in sec .",

    "sm are described in secs .",
    "4 and 5 correspondingly .",
    "we consider the rg effects on 1 - 3 mixing and dependence of the effects on scale of new physics in sec .",
    "conclusions are formulated in sec .",
    "a general scheme for the qlc relations is that `` lepton   mixing = bi - maximal  mixing - ckm '' , where the bi - maximal mixing matrix is  @xcite u_bm = u_23^m u_12^m = (    ccc & & 0 + -1 & 1 & + 1 & - 1 &    ) .",

    "that is , the same mechanism which is responsible for the smallness of neutrino mass leads also to the large lepton mixing , and it is the seesaw mechanism @xcite that plays the role of additional structure that generates the bi - maximal mixing .",

    ", there are two possibilities : + ( i ) in a certain ( `` symmetry '' ) basis , where the theory of flavor is formulated , the neutrino mass matrix is of the bi - maximal form .",
    "so @xmath20 , and the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonalized by the ckm rotation : @xmath21",
    "the problem here is that the masses of charged leptons and down quarks are different : in particular , @xmath22 , whereas @xmath23 , and also @xmath24 at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale . since @xmath25 , the equality ( [ lckm ] ) implies particular structure of the mass matrices in which mixing weakly depends on eigenvalues .",
    "\\(ii ) in the `` symmetry '' basis both the bimaximal and ckm mixings come from the neutrino mass matrix , and the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal .",

    "the dirac mass matrix of neutrinos is the origin of the ckm rotation , whereas the majorana mass matrix of the right  handed ( rh ) neutrinos is responsible for the bi - maximal mixing .",
    "since the eigenvalues of the dirac neutrino mass matrix are unknown we can assume an exact equality of the mass matrices m_u = m^d _ , [ udmatr ] as a consequence of the quark - lepton symmetry .",
    "the equality ( [ udmatr ] ) propagates the ckm mixing from the quark to the lepton sector precisely . in this case",
    ", however , the gatto - sartori - tonin relation between the cabibbo angle and the ratio of down quark masses @xcite turns out to be accidental .",
    "furthermore , one needs to explain why in the symmetry basis both the charged lepton and down quark mass matrices are diagonal simultaneously in spite of difference of eigenvalues .",
    "these two cases have different theoretical implications , however the phenomenological consequences and the rg effects are the same .",
    "+ in the scenario under consideration , the relation ( [ qlcrel ] ) is not realized precisely even for zero phases @xmath26 since the @xmath27 rotation matrix should be permuted with @xmath28 in ( [ qlc1mat ] ) to reduce the mixing matrix to the standard parameterization form @xcite . from ( [ qlc1mat ] )",

    "<S> we consider a scenario for the quark - lepton complementarity relations between mixing angles in which the bi - maximal mixing follows from the neutrino mass matrix . according to this scenario in the lowest order the angle @xmath0 is @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) above the best fit point coinciding practically with the tri - bimaximal mixing prediction . </S>",
    "<S> realization of this scenario in the context of the seesaw type - i mechanism with leptonic dirac mass matrices approximately equal to the quark mass matrices is studied . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the renormalization group corrections to @xmath0 as well as to @xmath3 in the standard model ( sm ) and minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in large part of the parameter space corrections @xmath4 are small or negligible . in the mssm version of the scenario </S>",
    "<S> the correction @xmath4 is in general positive . </S>",
    "<S> small negative corrections appear in the case of an inverted mass hierarchy and opposite cp parities of @xmath5 and @xmath6 when leading contributions to @xmath0 running are strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections are negative in the sm version in a large part of the parameter space for values of the relative cp phase of @xmath5 and @xmath6 : @xmath7 . </S>"
