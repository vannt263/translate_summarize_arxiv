    "for more than ten years , the complex phenomenology observed in two dimensional semiconductor structures with spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) has been at the forefront of numerous experimental and theoretical explorations @xcite .",
    "originating in the asymmetry of the quantum well or in the inversion asymmetry of the crystal structure , the spin orbit interaction , of the rashba @xcite and dresselhaus @xcite type , respectively , describes the coupling of the electron spin to its momentum , generating the possibility of simultaneous spin and charge effects , as well as the possibility of controlling the spin through the application of electric fields @xcite .",
    "it is the latter reason that underlies the continuous interest , because of a potential realization of semiconductor based spintronic devices . from this perspective",
    ", the investigation of magnetotransport properties was focused from the very beginning on identifying the best set - up which , in the presence of electric or magnetic fields , can showcase spin - dependent macroscopic response functions , and in particular spin or spin - polarized currents .",
    "the transport theory of landau levels in the presence of electrostatic modulation goes already back a quarter of a century @xcite .",
    "since then these systems have attracted continued attention . in the more recent years of spintronics the effects of soc were added @xcite , modulation effects on the spin hall conductance were studied @xcite , and the effects of a tilted magnetic field were considered @xcite .",
    "as has been pointed out , the spin - orbit effect can be relatively enhanced in a tilted magnetic field , as observed both in transport @xcite and magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "the origin of this enhancement is that at landau level crossing , where the orbital and zeeman energies are equal , the landau levels are linear with the soc strength , and the spin mixing is maximized @xcite .",
    "the suppression of orbital energy can also be achieved in one dimensional systems with periodic modulation where it has been proposed that signature of soc can be measured in two terminal transport @xcite .",
    "the experimental detection of the soc in a nanostructure is in general difficult .",
    "the response functions depend on the energy dispersion , which usually include some weak effects of the soc .",
    "an interesting situation was described in ref .",
    "@xcite where the energy spectrum of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) , laterally symmetric quantum wire , was calculated . due to the interplay of soc and an in - plane magnetic field perpendicular to the length of a wire",
    "the energy dispersion becomes asymmetric with respect to the sign reversal of the momentum along the wire @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite predicted that this situation can be experimentally verified by phototransport measurements , where an asymmetric band structure is essential for obtaining photocurrents @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , to our knowledge such experiments are not reported for quantum wires or another nanostructure with lateral confinement , where the electrons are the current carriers .",
    "photoconductivity had been studied in the two - dimensional electron gas with soc , but based on a different mechanism , of an imbalanced population of electrons with different spin orientation under the action of light and an in - plane magnetic field @xcite . only in a recent study magnetophotocurrents with possible spin polarization",
    "have been generated by electron - hole excitations in asymmetric rashba spin - split bands in layered semiconductor bitei @xcite .",
    "more complicated asymmetries of the energy spectra , for example due to the simultaneous presence of rashba and dresselhaus soc in thick quantum wells in magnetic field , can generate equilibrium spin currents which are still not observed in experiments @xcite .    in the present paper we propose alternative possibilities to detect the effect on the energy dispersion resulting from the combination of soc and an in - plane magnetic field in a 2d electron system ( 2des ) .",
    "we consider a tilted magnetic field with a vertical component that is strong enough to induce the quantization of the landau levels in the electron plane .",
    "we also consider a lateral modulation in the plane obtained by applying a periodic electrostatic potential along one direction in the plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .",
    "we show that in the presence of soc the resulting landau bands , and implicitly the density of states , depend on the orientation of the in - plane magnetic field relatively to the direction of the modulation",
    ". in particular , if the electrostatic modulation has an inversion symmetry , the landau bands do not obey it .",
    "we calculate the conductivity tensor and the total energy of the modulated 2des and show that the presence of the soc could be observed in magnetotransport and magnetization experiments , in a tilted magnetic field rotating conically around the normal direction to the plane .",
    "in the following discussion we consider the 2des situated in the @xmath1 plane , and subjected to a lateral modulation along the @xmath2 direction which is induced by applying a periodic potential , @xmath3 .",
    "a magnetic field of magnitude @xmath4 , tilted in respect with the @xmath5 axis is also applied .",
    "its direction is described by the usual angular representation , @xmath6 , as shown in fig.[fig : system ] .",

    "well know rashba - dresselhaus transformation , the landau bands obtained with @xmath23 , @xmath55 , and @xmath57 are identical to those obtained with @xmath55 , @xmath23 , and @xmath58 .    to conclude this section we notice that , according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ez])-([eq : em ] ) , the amplitude of the landau bands depends on the strength of the soc and on the orientation of the in - plane magnetic field relatively to the modulation direction . in particular ,",
    "if the external potential is an even function of @xmath48 , the expected even parity of the landau bands in the brillouin zone is broken by the rashba soc if @xmath59 , or by the dresselhaus soc if if @xmath60 .",
    "in order to increase the effect of the soc on the energy dispersion we consider a modulation potential with an amplitude much larger that the cyclotron energy which can generate higher harmonics in the dispersion of the energy bands . to be more realistic",

    "we use the hartree - fock approximation where the fock exchange is screened with the static polarizability . the long - range direct coulomb term tends to screen the external potential and reduce the energy dispersion of the landau bands , whereas the short - range exchange term tends to increase the dispersion by contributing with negative energy to the occupied states @xcite .",

    "the density of electrons is @xmath75 . in order to maximize the effect of the soc we tilt the magnetic field such that the zeeman and cyclotron energies are equal in the absence of the modulation , which allows the strongest mixing of spin up and spin down states .",
    "the corresponding polar angle is @xmath64 .",
    "the total magnetic field is @xmath63 t. the brillouin zone corresponds to center coordinate interval @xmath76 .",

    "whereas if the magnetic field is tilted along @xmath48 the bands become asymmetric , due to the rashba soc .",
    "consequently observables that depend on the energy structure should be anisotropic relatively to a rotation of the magnetic field around the @xmath0 axis , i. e. with a fixed polar angle @xmath53 . in the following",
    "we describe such results for the electrical conductivity and for the magnetization of the modulated 2des endowed with soc .",

    "the longitudinal conductivity parallel to the modulation strips , @xmath82 , is dominated by the drift of the electrons along the strips , which is known as band conductivity , but also incorporates a weaker scattering component @xcite .",
    "the scattering conductivity is ( approximately ) proportional to the density of states at the fermi level squared and therefore its maxima correspond to the van hove singularities of the energy bands .",
    "in contrast , the band conductivity is inversely proportional to the same quantity , and therefore has maxima in the middle of the landau bands . in a similar manner",
    "the scattering conductivity is proportional to @xmath83 whereas the band conductivity is proportional to @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "we treat the hall conductivity in the simplest possible way , with a filling - factor ( @xmath85 ) dependent formula , @xmath86 , which does not describe hall plateaus , but it is still a qualitatively reasonable result for a strong modulation .",

    "fig : resistivity ] the longitudinal resistivities @xmath87 in general @xmath88 @xcite and therefore @xmath89 and @xmath90 . on account of the opposite relation between conductivities and density of states",

    "[ fig : resistivity ] we notice a succession of a local maximum and a local minimum for @xmath92 for @xmath93 ( which is dominated by the band conductivity via @xmath82 ) , since the density of states at the fermi level increases by approaching the top of a landau band , and the other order , first a minimum and then a maximum for @xmath94 ( which is dominated by the scattering conductivity @xmath78 ) .",
    "the large dispersion of the landau bands and the relatively small disorder broadening determine a value for @xmath94 that is three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath93 .    in the transport calculations we included a dresselhaus soc with @xmath95 mev nm ,",

    "the behavior of the resistivities is complex and rather difficult to interpret .",
    "nevertheless , as expected from the landau band structure , the message is that both longitudinal resistivities ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) should depend on the orientation of the magnetic field projection in the plane of the 2des , i. e. on the azimuthal angle @xmath54 .     or @xmath48 direction , i. e. when @xmath51 ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath69 ) , respectively .",

    "[ fig : landau_bands ] , which is the situation in all our calculations .",
    "the oscillations of the magnetization in the modulated 2des are also quite complex , being determined by the band structure , but indirectly influenced by the coulomb many - body effects . the exchange interaction may lead to larger magnetization fluctuations than expected for noninteracting electrons @xcite .",
    "consistently with the dispersion of the landau bands , due to the presence of the soc , the magnetization also depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath54 of the in - plane magnetic field . like in the transport calculations we considered two values of the rashba soc strength for comparison .",
    "since the van hove singularities of the landau bands may shift either up or down with increasing @xmath23 , the magnetization peaks may shift either up or down on the magnetic field scale , irrespective of the orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "we calculated the landau bands produced in a 2des by a periodic unidirectional potential in the presence of a tilted magnetic field , with a strong component perpendicular to the 2des . in the absence of soc ,",
    "when the spin contributes only with the zeeman coupling to the total magnetic field , the landau bands do not depend on the orientation of the in - plane component of the magnetic field relatively to the direction of the modulation .",
    "they depend on the polar angle @xmath53 , but not on the azimuthal angle angle @xmath54 , indicated in fig . [",
    "fig : system ] .",
    "the interplay of the soc , the unidirectional periodic modulation , and the in - plane magnetic field , result in landau bands whose dispersion explicitly depends on the projections of the magnetic field on axes perpendicular and parallel to the modulation , respectively .",
    "therefore measured observables like electrical resistances or magnetization , in the quantum hall regime , in a tilted magnetic field , should be sensitive to the rotation of the field , conically , around the normal to the 2des plane , i. e. to the azimuthal angle angle @xmath54 .",
    "such experimental investigations are reported for the homogeneous 2des @xcite , but , to the best of our knowledge , not for the modulated 2des .",
    "we are also not aware of alternative experimental evidence of the asymmetric energy dispersion due to the interplay of soc and an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the results that we have shown for the electrical resistance and magnetization are only qualitative . as long as the soc effects are weak ,",
    "they become significant only for landau bands with strong dispersion , produced by a modulation potential considerably larger than the cyclotron energy .",
    "given the complexity of the landau bands , especially due to the inclusion of the coulomb effects , it is difficult to make reliable quantitative predictions on the anisotropy of the magnetization or resistances ( which are complex observables themselves ) in order to relate some features with the soc strength .",
    "the asymmetry under magnetic field orientation could become a diagnostic tool for an estimate of the soc presence and intensity in the 2des .",
    "since the van hove singularities at the band edges can be well resolved in the magnetization we expect that the soc effects on the landau bands could be better observable in magnetization , rather than in magnetotransport measurements .",
    "finally , the observation of this soc effect in the magnetoresistance and magnetization experiments proposed in this paper , is likely to depend not only on the soc strength itself , but also on the sample characteristics , such as disorder or electron concentration , details that can only be established in future experimental work ."
