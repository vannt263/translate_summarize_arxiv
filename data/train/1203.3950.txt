    "the spatial search problem is to find a marked object from an unsorted database of size @xmath1 spread over distinct locations , with the restriction that one can proceed from any location to only its neighbors while inspecting the objects .",
    "classical algorithms for the unsorted database search can do no better than inspect one location after another , and so are @xmath2 . on the other hand , quantum algorithms can do better by working with a superposition of states .",
    "the quantum spatial search problem has been studied extensively in recent years , in a variety of geometries ranging from a single hypercube to regular lattices in various integer dimensions ( see for example , refs .",
    "these investigations used local translationally invariant quantum walk operators @xcite , arising from relativistic quantum mechanics in some form , to obtain their results . here",
    "we investigate the spatial search on a fractal lattice , which has neither a translational symmetry nor a straightforward structure to implement the relativistic dirac operator .",
    "the non - integral value of the fractal dimension also lets us explore the dependence of the spatial search on the geometry of space in more generality .",
    "our algorithmic strategy for the quantum search is to construct a hamiltonian evolution , whereby the kinetic term diffuses the amplitude distribution all over the space and the potential term attracts the amplitude distribution toward the marked vertex @xcite . in its discrete form ,",
    "the kinetic term is realized as the quantum walk operator @xmath3 , explicitly defined in section iii .",
    "a relativistic walk provides the fastest diffusion , and is expected to produce the quickest search .",
    "the best potential term is the one that provides maximum contrast between the marked vertex and the rest . in its discrete form , it is the binary oracle .",
    "choosing the origin as the marked vertex , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the time - step size .",
    "the algorithm alternates between the oracle and the walk operators , yielding the time evolution @xmath6^{t_2 } |\\psi(\\vec{x};0,0)\\rangle ~. \\label{evolsearch}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 is the number of oracle calls , and @xmath8 is the number of walk steps between the oracle calls .",
    "both have to be optimized , depending on the spatial distribution of the vertices , to concentrate the amplitude distribution toward the marked vertex as quickly as possible and to solve the spatial search problem .",
    "the iterative evolution of eq.([evolsearch ] ) redistributes the amplitude at each vertex over itself and its neighbors at every step .",
    "unitarity of the evolution means that the eigenvalues have unit magnitude , and so the results of the algorithm are periodic in time .",
    "grover s algorithm is the special case where one can move from any vertex to any other vertex in just one step , which can be interpreted as the @xmath9 limit of spatial search @xcite . unlike grover s algorithm",
    ", the maximum probability of being at the marked vertex , @xmath10 , does not reach the value @xmath11 for a generic spatial search . augmenting the algorithm by the amplitude amplification procedure @xcite",
    ", the marked vertex can be found with probability @xmath12 , and the overall complexity of the algorithm is then characterized by the effective number of oracle calls @xmath13 .",
    "we have argued @xcite that the spatial search in @xmath14 dimensions obeys two lower bounds , @xmath15 they , respectively , follow from the distinct physical principles of special relativity ( i.e. the walk must be able to travel across the lattice ) and unitarity ( i.e. grover s algorithm is optimal in the absence of any constraint on walk movements ) . the best spatial search algorithms , therefore , appear in the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "moreover , an analogy with statistical mechanics of critical phenomena in different dimensions , having an interplay of multiple dynamical features , provides an understanding of the scaling behavior of the spatial search . for @xmath16 , the latter bound wins , and the spatial search is @xmath17 differing only in scaling prefactors .",
    "the two bounds cross in the critical dimension @xmath18 , where logarithmic corrections to scaling behavior are expected and have indeed been observed @xcite . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the former bound dominates and should govern the scaling behavior of the spatial search .",
    "but the relativistic evolution operator is power - law infrared divergent there ( as @xmath20 in the continuum formulation ) , which may modify the scaling behavior compared to the bound .",
    "the preceding arguments do not provide any new insight for @xmath21 , where both classical and quantum spatial search are @xmath2 .",
    "we need non - integral values of @xmath14 to convincingly test the analogy of the spatial search with critical phenomena in statistical mechanics , and to that end we have investigated the spatial search on fractal lattices .",
    "many candidates for fractal lattices are available with @xmath22 , and for them we expect the spatial search to have a power - law scaling form , say @xmath23 .",
    "we want to determine how the exponent @xmath24 depends on @xmath14 , in particular whether it indeed equals @xmath25 , and we specifically work with fractals known as sierpinski gaskets .",
    "fractals are self - similar structures , and are conveniently defined using a recursive scheme in an embedding space , say of euclidean dimensions @xmath26 .",
    "( this is in contrast to regular lattices generated by repetitive unit cells in translationally invariant systems , where @xmath27 . ) for sierpinski gaskets , the recursive structure is a regular simplex .",
    "that is an equilateral triangle for @xmath28 , and fig .",
    "1 illustrates the recursive generation of the sierpinski gasket as a function of the stage number @xmath29 .    at stage @xmath29 ,",
    "the linear extent of sierpinski gaskets is @xmath30 .",
    "since a simplex has @xmath31 vertices , the total number of vertices @xmath1 in sierpinski gaskets is given by , @xmath32 thus the fractal ( also called the hausdorff ) dimension of sierpinski gaskets is @xmath33    dynamical phenomena on fractals have been investigated before @xcite , in particular the classical random walk and the vibrational problem . instead of the translational symmetry of regular lattices ,",
    "self - similar fractals have the dilation ( or the scale ) symmetry .",
    "that leads to power - law scaling behavior for physical observables , and the critical exponents for various well - known fractals have been calculated .",
    "the most common operator appearing in the dynamical equations is the laplacian , and the critical behavior is then governed by the scaling of its spectral density , @xmath34 this result can be understood as the reciprocal space for the laplacian ( or the brillouin zone ) having an effective dimension @xmath35 , which is called the spectral ( or the fracton ) dimension @xcite . in the case of sierpinski gaskets ,",
    "@xmath36 which can not exceed @xmath37 although @xmath14 can .    for regular lattices , @xmath38 , whereas it is observed that @xmath39 in general . note that both the position and the reciprocal space describe the same number of degrees of freedom in the same number of embedding dimensions .",
    "so @xmath40 means that the arrangement of vertices is different ( in terms of connectivity as well as spacings ) in the position and the reciprocal spaces . for the sierpinski gaskets in two and three embedding dimensions , the relevant dimensions are : @xmath41",
    "both the classical random walk and the vibrational problem involve the same laplacian in their spatial dependence , although they differ in their temporal dependence ( first and second derivative respectively ) .",
    "so their critical exponents depend on the same @xmath35 , but the dependence differs in phenomena involving temporal correlations . for the relativistic quantum walk problem we are addressing , the appropriate scaling behavior corresponds to that for the vibrational problem ( and not the classical random walk )",
    ".    now quantum walk diffuses at relativistic speeds on a hypercubic lattice when the dirac operator is used for time evolution .",
    "but it is unclear how to extend the relevant clifford algebra to non - integer dimensions @xcite .",
    "so our earlier methodology for the spatial search on hypercubic lattices @xcite can not be implemented on fractals , and we need a different implementation of a quantum relativistic walk .",
    "it is known that the flip - flop walk diffuses relativistically @xcite , and can be easily applied to graphs where all the vertices have the same connectivity .",
    "that happens to be the case for sierpinski gaskets , which have @xmath42 neighbors for every vertex .",
    "we therefore first construct the flip - flop walk on sierpinski gaskets , in terms of independent walk steps along every link , and then use it to study the spatial search problem .",
    "the flip - flop walk @xcite is constructed in the joint hilbert space containing both the position and the link degrees of freedom , @xmath43 every link attached to a given vertex is assigned its own direction pointing away from the vertex , so the dimension @xmath44 of @xmath45 is the number of neighbors for the vertex .",
    "( for ease of implementation , we take this number to be the same for each vertex . )",
    "the walk step consists of a shift operation followed by a mixing of the link amplitudes , i.e. @xmath46 . the shift operation first propagates the quantum amplitude along its link direction , and then reverses the link direction , @xmath47 note that when the graph has a link @xmath48 at the vertex @xmath49 , it automatically has a link @xmath50 at the vertex @xmath51 .",
    "the mixing of links at every vertex is the reflection in the mean operation ( also referred to as the grover coin @xcite ) , @xmath52    both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are reflection operators , @xmath55 , and the walk spreads on the lattice because these two operators do not commute .",
    "@xmath53 is block diagonal on the links , and its eigenstates are the combinations @xmath56 for every link , with eigenvalues @xmath57 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath58 ~.\\ ] ] on the other hand , @xmath54 is block diagonal on the vertices , @xmath59 ~.\\ ] ] for every vertex , it has one eigenvalue @xmath60 corresponding to the isotropic distribution , and @xmath61 eigenvalues @xmath62 corresponding to other orthogonal distributions .",
    "the unbiased uniform superposition state , @xmath63 is invariant under both @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( i.e. both operators have eigenvalue @xmath60 ) .",
    "furthermore , the oracle @xmath64 trivially commutes with @xmath54 .",
    "when the lattice has translational invariance , @xmath65 can be simplified by fourier transforming to the momentum space , and then the eigenspectrum of the walk can be obtained by diagonalizing a @xmath66 matrix describing the operator @xmath3 for each value of the momentum @xcite .",
    "such an analysis , however , is not possible for a fractal .",
    "= 8.8 cm      we first implement the flip - flop walk on the sierpinski gasket in two dimensions . as can be seen from fig .  1 , all the internal vertices of the gasket have four neighbors , whereas the three corner vertices have only two neighbors",
    ". we increase the number of neighbors for the corner vertices to four , by providing a periodic wraparound as illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "furthermore , to conveniently label the vertices and to keep track of their neighbors , we embed the gasket in a two - dimensional rectangular grid as shown in fig .  3 .",
    "in this configuration , there are six possible walk directions in general , as depicted in fig .  4 , out of which only four are valid for any given vertex .",
    "we separate the vertices in to six types , also shown in fig .  4 , depending on which of the four walk directions are applicable to them .",
    "note that v0 , v1 and v2 are internal vertices , whereas v3 , v4 and v5 are the corner vertices .    with this infrastructure ,",
    "we can now explicitly write down the operations involved in the flip - flop walk . the shift operation is : @xmath67 the mixing of link amplitudes occurs only among the four valid directions at each vertex .",
    "it can be described by the operator matrix , @xmath68    these definitions can be easily extended for flip - flop walks on sierpinski gaskets in any number of dimensions , with @xmath69 .",

    "= 8.8 cm    = 8.8 cm = 8.8 cm    with ancilla control , our fits yield : @xmath174 we observe that @xmath144 is only slightly larger than @xmath141 , the scaling exponent @xmath156 is essentially the same , and @xmath157 is a constant close to @xmath158 , all consistent with tulsi s predictions .",
    "we estimate the scaling behavior as : @xmath175 moreover , direct fits for the complexity behavior give : @xmath176    here the fact that @xmath177 is an important finding . in this case , the embedding dimension @xmath165 and the hausdorff dimension @xmath18 . were either of them controlling the scaling behavior of the spatial search ,",
    "we would have found @xmath178 .",
    "our clearly distinct result once again tells us that the dynamics of the spatial search is governed by the spectral dimension .",
    "we have described how the flip - flop walk contains within it a relativistic klein - gordon propagator , and then used it to solve the spatial search problem on fractals .",
    "the analogy with critical phenomena in statistical mechanics suggests that , for @xmath22 , physical observables have power - law scaling behavior .",
    "also , for @xmath179 , the fully relativistic spatial search algorithm suffers from infrared divergence , which we have suppressed by tulsi s ancilla controlled version that is equivalent to the introduction of an effective mass or a self - loop at the marked vertex .",
    "specifically , we have carried out numerical simulations for sierpinski gaskets in two and three dimensions , keeping the relative position of the marked vertex in the gasket fixed , and our results support all the expectations .",
    "an important finding is that we are able to reach the lower bound of @xmath180 oracle calls , where @xmath14 is the spectral dimension and not the fractal dimension .",
    "these two dimensions are not equal for fractals , and we find that the smaller spectral dimension governs the scaling exponents .",
    "note that the solution of the quantum spatial search problem has to be simultaneous in both the position space and the reciprocal momentum space .",
    "the position space evolution proceeds from a uniform distribution toward a @xmath181-function , and the momentum space evolution proceeds from a @xmath181-function toward a uniform distribution .",
    "thus it is fully understandable that the stricter of the lower bounds ( i.e. the smaller value of @xmath35 ) governs the scaling behavior of the problem ."
