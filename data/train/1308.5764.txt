    "orbifolds arise naturally in many areas such as topology , geometric group theory , symplectic geometry and so on . in the last decade , they have been actively studied after chen and ruan introduced a new cohomology ring structure on orbifold cohomology @xcite . orbifolds also naturally appears when there is a symmetry , such as in symplectic reductions or in the presence of group actions .",
    "a very natural and basic question is to find the sub - objects for a given orbifold .",
    "a suborbifold ( a subset which is also an orbifold with the induced topology ) turns out to be a very restrictive notion . for example , given a product of two orbifolds the correct notion of diagonal @xmath0(see definition [ orbdiag ] ) does not become a suborbifold but it is what is called an _ orbifold embedding _ into the product orbifold .",
    "hence , it is clear that one should enlarge the class of sub - objects of an orbifold by including orbifold embeddings .",
    "although the definition of orbifold embeddings appear in @xcite , such a notion has not been studied further .",
    "we became interested in this question of sub - objects in order to consider a proper notion of a fukaya category of an orbifold .",
    "in the fukaya category of a symplectic manifold , its objects are lagrangian submanifolds decorated with additional data , and we believe that in the case of symplectic orbifolds , lagrangian orbifold embeddings should become an important object in its fukaya category .",
    "( in this paper , we do not consider the fukaya category of an orbifold , which is left for future research . )    in this paper we give a slightly modified definition of orbifold embedding and explore several properties of orbifold embeddings .",
    "also we prove that given an abelian orbifold embedding , the induced map between inertia orbifolds again becomes an orbifold embedding ( theorem [ thminertia ] ) .",
    "one drawback of the definition of orbifold embedding is that it is rather cumbersome to work with as it is defined using local data .",
    "also we observe that this notion of orbifold embedding is not morita invariant .",
    "the second half of this paper is to remedy this in the case of translation groupoids .",
    "namely , we construct an equivariant immersion in sections 7 and 8 , from the data of an orbifold embedding to an orbifold groupoid which is morita equivalent to a translation groupoid @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "equivariant immersions are much easier to work with than orbifold embeddings , hence this construction should be very useful in applications .",
    "pronk and scull @xcite showed that for translation groupoids , morita equivalence can be defined only using translation groupoids , and our result is also in a similar point of view .",
    "to construct such an equivariant immersion , we use the hilsum - scandalis map , which is reviewed in section 6 .",
    "not all equivariant immersions give rise to orbifold embeddings , and we define what we call a _ strong _ equivariant immersion , which is shown to give an orbifold embedding . also the equivariant immersion obtained from orbifold embeddings are also strong . hence , in the case of translation groupoids , one can work with strong equivariant immersions , instead of orbifold embeddings .",

    ". one can define orbifolds in terms of local uniformizing charts ( due to satake ) .",
    "an orbifold is a hausdorff , second countable topological space @xmath2 with a collection of uniformizing charts @xmath3 of @xmath2 , where the finite group @xmath4 acts effectively on the manifold @xmath5 , and continous maps @xmath6 which descend to a homeomorphism @xmath7 of @xmath8 onto an open subset @xmath9 .",

    "this generalizes the notion of classical orbifolds allowing noneffective orbifolds .",
    "recall that a groupoid is a ( small ) category whose morphisms are all invertible . giving a topological structure and smooth structure on groupoids , we get the notion of lie groupoids .",

    "the only plausible action of @xmath31 that may exist on @xmath116 is by the left multiplication on the first component .",

    "we remark that the orbifold embedding is not morita invariant .",
