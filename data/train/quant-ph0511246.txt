    "transferring a quantum state or object from one place to another is an important task in quantum information science .",
    "recent works find that the quantum spin chain can be used to act as quantum data bus  to perfectly transfer quantum states which has drawn the attention of quantum communication community bose1,liying , song , christandle1,christandle2,christandle3,bose2,bose3,shitao1,shitao2 .",
    "a great advantage of this approach is that no dynamical controls are needed after we prepared the quantum state ( except for the detection of the state at the other end of spin chain ) that is only the sending and the receiving parties apply gates to the system , but the part of the chain interconnecting them can not be controlled during the communication process .    in the first proposal @xcite ,",
    "bose considered a regular one - dimensional spin chain with heisenberg interactions which is able to transfer quantum state over reasonable distance with the aid of distillation process .",
    "this proposal is not the perfect scheme to transfer quantum state due to the dispersion of the spin chain .",
    "this result in the fidelity for a single - qubit state transfer becomes worse as the chain get longer .",
    "since then , a number of interesting proposals are proposed for quantum communication through spin system to improve the fidelity of the quantum information transfer .",
    "one of them is to choose proper the modulation of the coupling strengths between two nearest neighbor sites as suggested in christandle1,christandle2,christandle3 . in such system , although an arbitrary local quantum state will spread as the time evolves , after a period of time the dispersed information will refocus  at the receiving location of the chain .",
    "so perfect states transfer can be realized .",
    "another approach is making use of gapped systems .",
    "the advantage of these schemes is the intermediate spins are only virtually excited . in this case , the two separated qubits are coupled and realized the entanglement of two point @xcite .",
    "it ensures that the transfer of single - qubit state has a very high fidelity .",
    "according to quantum mechanics , perfect state transfer can be realized in many continuous and discrete systems . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider a single - particle system with the usual spatial refection symmetry ( srs ) .",
    "the srs can be expressed by @xmath0=0 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the spatial refection operator and @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of the system . if the eigen values @xmath3 match the parities @xmath4 in the following way @xmath5any state @xmath6 can evolve into the reflected state @xmath7 after time @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the position of sites in the lattice .",
    "( [ spmc ] ) is called the spectrum - parity matching condition ( spmc ) , which can conduct us to find various artificial solid state system transferring quantum states with high fidelity .",
    "it is easy to find that the model of @xcite corresponds to the spmc for the simplest case @xmath10 .",
    "as analyzed above , many different schemes can realize a quantum state transfer between two parties by means of a spin chain : the state of the leftmost qubit is transferred to the rightmost qubit after a given time , depended on the dynamics of the chain , to achieve perfect state transfer over arbitrary distances .",
    "it also indicates that the revival period is determined by the size of the system , but not the distance between two parties .",
    "so it is necessary for us to find a new model to control the revival period .",
    "on the other hand , the model we considered must satisfy the spmc . the previous work @xcite has considered @xmath11-site spin-@xmath12 ferromagnetic heisenberg chain in the parabolic magnetic field , which is the most simple model satisfying spmc .",
    "inspired by this paper , it is natural for us to study other extension of the application of the theorem with @xmath13 . in this paper",
    ", we present a new example , based on the spmc and super - symmetry theory in quantum mechanics .",
    "the protocol we considered is a ferromagnetic heisenberg chain with uniform coupling constant in an external magnetic field .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that if the external field is parabolic , the lower spectrum is equal - spacing , which is a good example to meet spmc in the simplest case @xmath14 . the super - symmetry theory in quantum mechanics @xcite implies that if the applied field is tangent - shaped , the lower spectrum should satisfy the spmc in the case @xmath15 . in the following sections",
    ", we will investigate the propagation of single - magnon state in the heisenberg chain in the confined external tangent magnetic field analytically and numerically .",
    "in general , the transfer of a qubit state from the location @xmath16 to @xmath17 can be regarded as the following process .",
    "the initial qubit state @xmath18 is prepared at @xmath16 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the two - level basis of the qubit at @xmath16 . for a spin system , we have @xmath21  and @xmath22 .",
    "if one can find an operation @xmath23  to realize @xmath24where",
    "@xmath25  is the known phase for a given system , we say the qubit state is transferred from @xmath16 to @xmath17 perfectly .",
    "bose @xcite pointed out that the operation @xmath23  can be achieved in the qubit array by the time evolution of the system . especially , the perfect state transfer can be performed if the system meets the spmc .",
    "unfortunately , such kind of array needs a deliberated modulation christandle1,christandle2,christandle3 , shitao2 for the couplings between two qubits , which is difficult to be pre - engineered in experiment . nevertheless , if the transferred state is not a qubit state at a certain site but the superposition of the single - qubit state localized in a small range of coordinate space , e.g. , a gaussian wave packet ( gwp ) represented as @xmath26 ( u\\left\\vert 1\\right\\rangle _ { i}+v\\left\\vert",

    "it indicates that , for a spin model with the saturated ferromagnetic state @xmath29 being the eigenstate , the transfer of a single - magnon gwp is equivalent to that of a qubit .    in this section ,",
    "we propose a model whose spectrum structure obeys the spmc in low energy for the near perfect transfer of a gwp .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of @xmath11-site spin-@xmath30 ferromagnetic heisenberg chain @xmath31 + \\sum_{i =- n}^{n}b(i)s_{i}^{z } ,   \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath32 is the exchange coupling constant .",

    "it implies that for lower energy scale , the spectrum can be obtained from the corresponding continuous model approximately . according to quantum mechanics @xcite , the energy spectrum of the continuous model @xmath58is@xmath59  where @xmath60the reason to choose the tan - potential is due to its rich spectrum structure as @xmath61  varies . for @xmath62 , the corresponding energy spectrum is@xmath63  which can be written as the quadratic term of @xmath64.on the other hand , when @xmath65  is taken into account , the linear term becomes dominant , which corresponds to that of parabolic potential shitao2 .    in this paper , we mainly focus on the case of @xmath62 , since the quadratic dispersion also meet the spmc . for a given @xmath66 as an example ,",

    "can be evolved into @xmath71 at time @xmath72 approximately . on the other hand , since the saturated ferromagnetic state @xmath73 is the ground state of the model , which is unchanged during the time evolution .",
