    "the cores of globular clusters harbour many interesting objects detected at different wavelengths , such as x - ray sources , ultraviolet and visual variables and blue stragglers , and radio pulsars .",
    "the sheer number density of stars in the cluster cores makes identification of sources detected in one wavelength range with those found at other wavelengths a daunting task , especially for x - ray sources whose positions are uncertain by more than an arcsecond at best .    as an example , x - ray sources detected in the core of 47@xmath0tuc  ( hasinger et al .",
    "1994 , henceforth called paper  1 ) have been tentatively identified with a cataclysmic variable ( paresce et al .",

    "1989 , minniti et al .",
    "these various options are possible due to the uncertainty in the absolute positions of the x - ray sources of about 5@xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we analyse three new rosat hri observations of the globular cluster 47@xmath0tuc , and re - analyse two . with use of the detailed astrometric study by geffert et al .",

    "1992 ) is given in table  [ ta ] .",
    "for reasons explained below , we treat the april 1992 and may 1992 data as two separate observations ( in contrast to paper  1 , where these were treated as a single observation ) .",

    "we find no evidence for @xmath7 excess brightness in individual observations .    for the sources in the core",

    "( observations a and b are too short for separate countrate determinations . )",
    "the resulting individual countrates are shown in fig .",
    "sources x@xmath09 and x@xmath010 are highly variable , the other sources are not significantly variable .    for conversion of the countrates to luminosities for the sources associated with 47@xmath0tuc , we assume a 1  kev bremsstrahlung spectrum , absorbed by @xmath8 @xmath9 . at a distance of 4.6  kpc",

    ", we use this conversion to compute the luminosities listed in table  [ tb ] .",
    "our analysis leads to the detection of 20 sources in the direction of 47@xmath0tuc . with the exception of x@xmath08 , all sources",
    "x@xmath01 - 15 discussed in paper  1 are detected again ; six new sources x@xmath016 - 21 have been added , of which x@xmath019 is in the core .",
    "source x@xmath08 was an artefact of the large relative shift between the april and may 1992 x - ray coordinate systems ; now that we apply bore sight corrections to these observations separately , source x@xmath08 is no longer found .",
    "five sources are detected in the core ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "four sources are detected within 2@xmath11 from the cluster center , rather more than expected randomly from the number of sources in the whole image ; we conclude that these four sources are probably also related to 47@xmath0tuc  ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "both the einstein observations ( aurire et al .  1989 ) and our rosat hri observations ( fig .",

    "3c in shara et al .  (",
    "1996 ) we estimate that v@xmath03 is about 9.4@xmath3 north of v@xmath02 ; and about 0.8@xmath3 east . this is close to x@xmath010 , but too far for v@xmath03 to be a candidate for identification with x@xmath010 .",
    "the two brightest constant sources x@xmath05 and x@xmath07 can not be identified with any of the blue and variable stars known in the core of 47@xmath0tuc .",
    "it is remarkable that the einstein satellite did not detect these sources , but only the variable source x@xmath09 .",
    "this suggests that x@xmath09 was significantly brighter during the einstein observations than x@xmath05 or x@xmath07 ; inspection of fig .",
    "[ fvar ] suggests that x@xmath09 occasionally may indeed get bright enough to outshine x@xmath05 and x@xmath07 .",
    "figure  [ flcore ] shows that there are four sources outside but near the core of 47@xmath0tuc .",
    "the source density of the whole image is such , that these four sources all probably are members of 47@xmath0tuc . in fig .",
    "[ flcore ] we show the positions of the central sources of our hri observations together with the two radio pulsars whose positions are known ( to about 0.01@xmath3 ) : 47@xmath0tuc  c and 47@xmath0tuc  d ( robinson et al .",
    "neither pulsar is detected in x - rays .",
    "no less than 11 radio pulsars have been detected in 47@xmath0tuc ; determination of the positions of pulsars",
    "47@xmath0tuc  e to n is awaited to see whether any of them coincides with an x - ray source .",
    "we investigate the existence of possible extended emission in two ways .",
    "first , we determine a total number of 3780 counts in a @xmath18 region centered on the central sources , and then subtract the 3200 counts assigned by our multi - source fit to individually detected sources in this region . of the excess of about 580 counts , some 230 are expected in the wings of the point spread functions of the individual sources , leaving about 350 counts .",
    "a similar excess is found by comparing the radial distribution of the detected counts with that of the point spread function between 20@xmath3 and 60@xmath3 from the x - ray center of the cluster .",
    "we conclude that there is extended emission in and/or near the core of 47@xmath0tuc , with a countrate of @xmath19cts / ksec , which corresponds to an x - ray luminosity at the distance of 47@xmath0tuc  of roughly @xmath20erg / s .",
    "we can not decide on the basis of our data whether this excess is due to one or two individual faint sources , or to a larger number of even fainter ones .      in the wider field of view shown in fig .",
    "[ fwhole ] , we have optically identified just two sources .",
    "the identification of x@xmath012 with hd@xmath02072 in our view is fairly secure , for the reasons given in paper  1 : hd@xmath02072 has visual magnitude @xmath21 , and the number of objects this bright in the optical is so small as to make chance coincidence unlikely . with @xmath22 for a g5 main - sequence star , we derive a distance of about 55  pc , and an x - ray luminosity for x@xmath012 of @xmath23erg / s , quite reasonable for a g@xmath05 star .",
    "( the smaller distance and luminosity correct the values given in paper  1 . )    the identification of x@xmath03 with a galaxy is somewhat less secure , in the sense that faint galaxies are sufficiently common to make a chance coincidence possible .",
    "because the x - ray position of x@xmath012 is more accurate than that of x@xmath03 , the shift between the optical and x - ray frame is determined mainly by the identification of x@xmath012 with hd@xmath02072 , and thus is not affected much by the correctness of the identification of x@xmath03 with the galaxy .",
    "we have detected five x - ray sources in the core of 47@xmath0tuc , and noted possible optical identifications for three of them .",
    "before we discuss the possible nature of these sources , we adress the question how confident we can be about the identifications . to do this , consider an area of @xmath24 , centered on the cluster center according to guhathakurta et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . from fig .",
    "[ fcore ] we learn that this area contains three x - ray sources and 22 blue or variable stars .",
    "( note that entry 8 of table  3 in geffert et al .",
    "( 1997 ) almost coincides with ako@xmath06 . )",
    "if we suggest identification for each blue object lying in a @xmath25 box centered on an x - ray source , then the x - ray sources cover 12%  of the search area , and we have 22 trials for probability 0.12 .",
    "the probabilities of finding 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 identifications are 6 , 18 , 26 and 23 % , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the probability that all suggested identifications are accidential is quite high .",
    "it may be argued that the suggested identifications are special also optically .",
    "if we consider the three objects v@xmath01 , v@xmath02 and v@xmath03 only , we have 3 trials for probability 0.12 , and the probability of finding 0 , 1 or 2 identifications are 68 , 28 and 4 % . even for this limited set ,",
    "the probability that both identifications of v@xmath01 with x@xmath09 and v@xmath02 with x@xmath019 are due to chance is non - negligible . for the moment",
    "we conclude that our suggested identifications are possible , but not secure .",
    "if we assume that v@xmath01 and v@xmath02 may be identified with x@xmath09 and x@xmath019 , respectively , we learn from fig .",
    "[ fcvs ] that their ratio of x - ray to optical flux is rather high if they are cataclysmic variables , but as expected for soft x - ray transients in quiescence .",
    "the x - ray countrates of the cataclysmic variables in fig .",
    "[ fcvs ] have not been corrected for interstellar absorption ; the correction is expected to be small for most systems , but not necessarily for all . for typical x - ray spectra of cataclysmic variables ,",
    "the visual flux is affected more strongly by interstellar absorption than the x - ray countrate , and thus it is not expected that correction for absorption will increase the ratio of x - ray to optical flux for cataclysmic variables .",
    "we conclude that fig .",
    "[ fcvs ] provides another illustration of the argument originally made by verbunt et al .",
    "( 1984 ) that some of the dim x - ray sources in the cores of globular clusters are too bright to be cataclysmic variables .",
    "the x - ray flux of x@xmath09 is variable ; that of x@xmath019 may or may not be variable .",
    "the range of variability in x@xmath09 is not unprecedented in soft x - ray transients in quiescence : the variations in the flux of cen x-4 in quiescence , reported by campana et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and shown in fig .",
    "[ fcvs ] , is of a similar magnitude as that observed in x@xmath09 .",
    "such variations in a quiescent soft x - ray transient are not expected to be accompanied by detectable optical variations , and thus the absence of optical variation in v@xmath01  need not be in conflict with the suggested identification .",
    "it may be noted that similar variations in the x - ray flux without accompanying variations in the optical are probably also possible in cataclysmic variables .",
    "for example , the dwarf nova vw  hyi was brighter in quiescence when observed with rosat in nov 1990 than when observed with exosat several years earlier ( wheatley et al .",
    "1996 , their fig .  7 ) .",
    "v@xmath02 has been detected at a level about 4 magnitudes above its quiescent level twice ; this magnitude difference is more indicative of a dwarf nova than of a soft x - ray transient , as noted by paresce &  de marchi ( 1994 ) and by shara et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the two constant x - ray sources x@xmath05 and x@xmath07 in the core of 47@xmath0tuc  have no suggested optical counterparts .",
    "the level and the constancy of their x - ray fluxes are compatible with them being radio pulsars .",
    "for example , psr@xmath0b@xmath26 in globular cluster m@xmath028 and psr@xmath0j@xmath27 , at comparable distances as 47@xmath0tuc  ( 5.5 and @xmath285.7 kpc , respectively compared to 4.6 kpc for 47@xmath0tuc ) , have rosat pspc countrates of the same order of magnitude as x@xmath05 and x@xmath07 .",
    "whether x@xmath05 or x@xmath07 , or any of the four x - ray sources just outside the core , can be identified with any of the 11 radio pulsars in 47@xmath0tuc  awaits further study of the radio pulsars , in particular determination of their positions , and of their period derivatives ( so that the x - ray data can be folded on a known period ) .",
    "more accurate pinpointing of the x - ray positions will be possible with axaf .",
    "considering the large numbers of potential optical counterparts , optical or ultraviolet monitoring of the inner region of 47@xmath0tucsimultaneous with the x - ray observations would be very useful , as detection of simultaneous x - ray and optical variability would strenghten any identification based on positional coincidence only .",
    "to summarize , we find possible optical counterparts for three of the five x - ray sources in the core of 47@xmath0tuc , but note that all could be chance positional coincidences .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of x@xmath05 , x@xmath07 and x@xmath09 are rather high for these to be cataclysmic variables , but compatible with soft x - ray transients in quiescence .",
    "x@xmath09 is a variable x - ray source , and its x - ray to optical flux ratio suggests that it is a soft x - ray transient , hitherto always observed in quiescence .",
    "the steadier sources x@xmath05 and x@xmath07 may be either soft x - ray transients or recycled radio pulsars .",
    "the sources x@xmath019 in the core , and x@xmath04 , x@xmath06 , x@xmath011 and x@xmath013 , outside but near the core , have x - ray luminosities @xmath29erg / s , compatible with them being soft x - ray transients , cataclysmic variables , or recycled radio pulsars .",
    "if v@xmath02 is indeed a cataclysmic variable , it is probably the best candidate counterpart hitherto suggested for an x - ray source in 47@xmath0tuc ."
