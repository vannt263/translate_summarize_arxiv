    "there are two reasons to imagine that interstellar comets could be widespread .",
    "first , they could be an important as - yet undetected reservoir of interstellar oxygen .",
    "second , models for the formation of the solar system s oort cloud predict that more comets are ejected into the interstellar medium than remain gravitationally bound to the sun .",
    "if our solar system is at all typical , then the birth of stars and planets might commonly lead to the creation of many interstellar comets .    despite decades of effort , analysis of the rate of appearance of new comets in the solar system",
    "has not provided a strong constraint on the space density of interstellar comets .",
    "substantial progress may require another approach . in this spirit , @xcite argued that one possible explanation for the  low \" observed frequency of gamma ray bursts arising from the milky way is that there are few interstellar comets impacting upon neutron stars .",
    "however , there are enough uncertainties in this approach , that their result that fewer than 4% of stars have oort clouds similar to the sun s is not completely firm .",
    "while also employing degenerate stars as a tool , here , we proceed somewhat differently .",
    "we argue that the small amounts of hydrogen accumulated by warm db white dwarfs significantly limits the rate of iceball impact with these stars and therefore the space density of interstellar comets .",
    "our method requires combining an understanding of the interstellar medium with the physics of external pollution of white dwarfs .",
    "we therefore subdivide this introduction into subsections to describe the different threads of our approach .      including both atoms in the gas phase and those estimated to be contained within dust grains , the abundance of oxygen within diffuse clouds , @xmath0(o)/@xmath0(h ) ,",
    "is within 15% of 5.1 @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "while this value is in agreement with recent determinations of the solar photospheric oxygen abundance of @xmath0(o)/@xmath0(h ) = 4.6 @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xcite or @xmath0(o)/@xmath0(h ) = 5.8 @xmath110@xmath2 @xcite , the true solar abundance may be as high as @xmath0(o)/@xmath0(h ) = 7.2 @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xcite . even with the problematical assumption that the interstellar and solar oxygen abundances are the same , the interstellar oxygen abundance is @xmath350% uncertain .",
    "the possibility of a missing reservoir of interstellar oxygen has been considered for decades @xcite , and here we re - assess the hypothesis that appreciable oxygen is carried within interstellar comets .",
    "furthermore , although not directly related to the question of the total abundance of interstellar oxygen , the observed decrease of @xmath0(o)/@xmath0(h ) with column density @xcite is not well understood and presents a  crisis \" in our understanding of the behavior and distribution of interstellar oxygen @xcite .",
    "with an interstellar density of hydrogen nuclei near the sun of 1.15 @xmath4 @xcite and with @xmath0(o)/@xmath0(h ) = 5.1 @xmath1 10@xmath2 , the mass density of interstellar oxygen is 1.6 @xmath1 10@xmath5 g @xmath4 .",
    "next , we compare this estimate with observational bounds and theoretical expectations for the space density interstellar comets and the amount of oxygen that they contain .      to date ,",
    "all observed solar system comets appear to have always been gravitationally bound to the sun . consequently @xcite and @xcite",

    "conventional dynamic models for the formation of the oort cloud from objects in the inner solar system @xcite predict that there could be as many as 50 comets ejected into the interstellar medium for every comet that remains bound to the sun .",
    "unconventional models for the oort cloud @xcite also must require significant numbers of interstellar comets .",
    "optimistic \" model for the space density of interstellar comets presumes that all stars form massive comet clouds similar to the solar system s oort cloud and that most of these comets are lost into the interstellar medium . with this picture",
    ", @xcite predicted that the space density of interstellar comets could be as high as 2 @xmath1 10@xmath8 @xmath4 ( or 7 @xmath1 10@xmath2 au@xmath6 ) , comparable to the observational upper limit of @xcite .",
    "consequently , ",
    "optimistic \" models predict that occasional interstellar comets can be observed within the solar system @xcite .",
    "however , since the mass of the oort cloud , the fraction of comets that are ejected into the interstellar medium and the fraction of stars that create analogs to the oort cloud are each uncertain by a factor of @xmath310 @xcite , the  optimistic \" scenario may vastly overestimate the true space density of interstellar comets .",
    "the basic idea of this paper is to use white dwarfs with helium dominated atmospheres ( dbs ) to limit the space density of interstellar comets .",
    "the large majority of white dwarfs have atmospheres which are hydrogen dominated and these stars are classified as das @xcite .",
    "the standard scenario is that gravitational settling of heavy elements is very effective , and therefore , with sufficient time , essentially all of the hydrogen is located in the star s outer envelope and dominates the composition of the photosphere @xcite .",
    "a minority of white dwarfs have so little hydrogen that they have helium dominated atmospheres even though all their hydrogen resides in the star s outer envelope . if lines from neutral helium are detected , they are classified as dbs . if too cool for neutral helium to be detectable yet they display heavy elements in their spectra , they are classified as dzs .",
    "two recent surveys show that white dwarfs accumulate hydrogen from an external source because there is a a correlation between the average hydrogen mass and a db s or dz s cooling age @xcite . the typical rate accretion rate is near 6 @xmath1 10@xmath9 g s@xmath10 @xcite , but there are large variations . in this paper , we focus on the @xmath350% of dbs with only upper bounds to the mass of accumulated hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the mass of the convective zone where the accreted material resides is a strong function of the star s effective temperature . because dbs with @xmath11 @xmath12 20,000 k have convective zones that are 10,000 times more massive than dbs with @xmath11 @xmath13 22,000 k @xcite , these two temperature classes may display external pollution quite differently .",
    "there is relatively little hydrogen in dbs warmer than 22,000 k. a conservative upper bound from optical and ultraviolet observations of most  warm \" dbs is that @xmath0(h)/@xmath0(he ) @xmath12 10@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "since the mass of the outer convective zones of these warm dbs is at most 5 @xmath1 10@xmath14 g @xcite , these stars have accumulated less than @xmath310@xmath15 g of hydrogen . as described in section 3 , two",
    "particularly well studied dbs , gd 190 and bpm 17088 , have accumulated less than 4 @xmath1 10@xmath16 g of hydrogen , roughly the amount of this element carried in a single average - size comet . at the  typical \" accretion rate of 6 @xmath1 10@xmath9 g s@xmath10 experienced by the cool dbs , these two stars would accumulate the upper bound to their hydrogen in less than 10@xmath17 yr , much less time than their cooling ages of 50 myr . either",
    "the warm dbs do not accrete at the same rate as many cooler dbs , or they lose almost all their acquired hydrogen in a wind .    in section 2 we elaborate in detail upon the  naive \" idea that warm dbs have not accumulated much hydrogen simply because they have not accreted from ice - rich asteroids , comets or gas from the interstellar medium ",
    "the current best candidates as the sources for hydrogen in cooler dbs . while this argument hardly seems remarkable , there are interesting consequences . using the toy model for a db s hydrogen budget developed in section 2 , in section 3 we constrain the mass carried within interstellar comets . in section 4 ,",
    "we outline observational possibilities while in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "we compute the amount of hydrogen in  warm \" dbs for a regime when essentially all of its hydrogen of mass , @xmath18 has risen to the surface layers and is well mixed in the outer convective zone of mass @xmath19 . there may be a very thin non - convective photosphere lying above the convective zone , but we assume that the photosphere and the convective zone have the same composition @xcite . if hydrogen is accreted with rate @xmath20 and the total mass loss rate is @xmath21 , then : @xmath22 equation ( 1 ) is mathematically equivalent to the expression governing the abundance of heavy atoms in the outer layer of a white dwarf where the atoms are  lost \" because of downward settling ( koester 2009 ) instead of our case where hydrogen atoms are lost in an outward flow in a wind .    for our purposes here",
    ", there is a crucial difference between accretion of gas from the interstellar medium and accretion from large solid objects such as asteroids .",
    "there is no reason to think that a quasi - spherical stellar wind strongly inhibits the accretion from a flat disk produced by tidal disruption of a parent body @xcite .",
    "in contrast , such a wind can physically block interstellar gas accretion .",
    "in particular , while winds of 10@xmath23 g s@xmath10 can prevent interstellar accretion at the typical rate , once accreted hydrogen is diluted into a helium - dominated envelope , much higher wind outfows are required to inhibit the build - up of observable amounts of hydrogen .",
    "it is useful to introduce the characteristic time for the wind to deplete the mass in the convective zone , @xmath24 : @xmath25 if @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath26 are independent of time , the solution to equation ( 1 ) is : @xmath27\\;=\\;m(h)[0]\\;e^{-t / t_{depl}}\\;+\\;{\\dot m}_{acc}(h)\\,t_{depl}\\,\\left(1\\,-\\,e^{-t / t_{depl}}\\right)\\ ] ] although equation ( 3 ) provides a guide to our results , it is inexact because @xmath19 is not constant during the star s cooling . in the numerical solutions to equation ( 1 ) presented below",
    ", we fit the detailed calculations for @xmath19 in a 0.6 m@xmath28 db without hydrogen by @xcite and @xcite in the temperature interval 22,000 k @xmath12 @xmath11 @xmath12 28,000 k with the expression : @xmath29 also , we relate the star s effective temperature to its cooling age by fitting the calculations of bergeronbergeron / coolingmodels / tables / table@xmath30db ] for a 0.6 @xmath31 db white dwarf with : @xmath32 because @xmath19 increases as the star ages , then , as can be seen from equation ( 1 ) , other factors being equal , the loss rate of hydrogen is diminished .",
    "consequently , instead of reaching an asymptotic value as predicted by equation ( 3 ) , as illustrated in figures 1 - 3 , @xmath18 continues to increase with time .",
    "we set @xmath33 = 0 for @xmath11 = 28,000 k , since at this moment in a db s cooling , @xmath19 becomes large enough that equation ( 1 ) can be sensibly employed .",
    "the value of @xmath34 $ ] is sensitive to the white dwarf s previous history @xcite .",
    "however , since the time for a 0.6 m@xmath28 db to cool from @xmath11 = 28,000 k to @xmath11 = 22,000 k is about 35 myr , then in most cases of interest , @xmath33 @xmath13 @xmath24 since we focus on wind loss rates greater than 10@xmath23 g s@xmath10 .",

    "@xcite has computed that radiatively - driven winds from white dwarfs with @xmath11 @xmath12 30,000 k do not occur .",
    "quite possibly , therefore , we should adopt @xmath21 = 0 .",
    "in contrast , in order to explain the presence of small amounts of dredged - up carbon in warm dbs , @xcite have proposed that @xmath21 is as high as @xmath310@xmath35 g s@xmath10 for @xmath11 @xmath13 20,000 k. however , the physical explanation for this putative wind is not provided .",
    "one possibility might be that the white dwarfs have hot coronae which could drive a wind @xcite .",
    "in fact , white dwarfs do have convective envelopes and there could be some transfer of the convective energy flux into heating the outer layers of the gas .",
    "we use two lines of evidence to bound the wind rates from warm white dwarfs .",
    "first , these stars are not x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "assume a wind outflow speed near the white dwarf s characteristic escape velocity , @xmath36 , of 4000 km s@xmath10 @xcite and consider the kinetic energy flow carried by the wind , @xmath37 .",
    "much of this energy is deposited into the surrounding interstellar medium to create a hot bubble . using the result that @xmath38 @xmath12 4 @xmath1 10@xmath39 erg s@xmath10 @xcite for gd 358",

    "consider sdss 1228 + 1040 with @xmath11 = 22,000 k , the hottest white dwarf known to be heavily polluted and possess a dust disk ( gaensicke et al .",
    "2006 , brinkworth et al .",
    "2009 , melis et al .",

    "then the heavy atom accretion rate is about 2 @xmath1 10@xmath41 g s@xmath10 .",
    "this value is within the range of 3 @xmath1 10@xmath42 g s@xmath10 to @xmath3 10@xmath40 g s@xmath10 inferred for most white dwarfs with dust disks @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that the wind rate from this star is less than 10@xmath40 g s@xmath10 .",
    "( we assume that this da without a convective envelope has the same mass loss rate as a db with a low mass convective envelope . therefore , this argument is not completely certain . )",
    "the source of the hydrogen in dbs with @xmath11 @xmath12 20,000 k is uncertain . if some of these stars accrete interstellar gas with the typical time - averaged hydrogen accretion rate given by @xcite of @xmath310@xmath23 g s@xmath10 , then @xmath21 likely is less than this value .",
    "because warm dbs have much less massive convective envelopes than cool dbs , there is no reason to imagine that @xmath21 increases dramatically with effective temperature .",
    "we conclude that the wind rates from warm dbs likely are less than 10@xmath40 g s@xmath10 and plausibly less than 10@xmath23 g s@xmath10 .",
    "besides a wind , white dwarfs also may lose mass in explosive events as occurs in novae . because there is no evidence that isolated white dwarfs undergo such events nor is there any theoretical reason to expect them",
    ", we ignore this possibility .",
    "although considered for many years , the physics of accreting interstellar hydrogen gas by white dwarfs is not well understood .",
    "it seems , for example , that accretion at the bondi - hoyle rate is excluded @xcite .",
    "dbs younger than 50 myr have performed less than one full oscillation through the galactic plane .",
    "therefore , these stars may have only encountered hot , low density material and consequently have accreted interstellar gas at a negligible rate during their entire cooling age . because accretion of interstellar gas - phase hydrogen can only strengthen the upper limits to asteroidal and cometary accretion discussed below , we neglect this possibility .      in our calculations for asteroidal accretion , we assume that @xmath20 = 6 @xmath1 10@xmath9 g s@xmath10 , a characteristic hydrogen accretion rate for dbs with @xmath11 @xmath12 20,000 k although there is a large variation in this rate @xcite . we show in figure 1 more detailed solutions to equation ( 1 ) . in these models , we see that if @xmath21 @xmath12 10@xmath40 g s@xmath10 , then dbs typically accumulate more hydrogen than observed .",

    "if the winds from these white dwarfs are plausibly weak , the mass of their analogs to oort cluds are smaller than the solar system s .",
    "either these stars never had many primoridal comets or they lost their comets when the star evolved on the asymptotic giant branch @xcite .",
    "we assume that the comet s hydrogen is visible in the star s outer convective zone .",
    "in fact , during its high - speed impact , the iceball might penetrate beneath the convective zone .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the material vaporized from the comet has such a high entropy that it quickly rises to the surface of the star and therefore could be detected .",
    "having argued above that the well known sources of hydrogen accretion are not important in many warm dbs , we now proceed to estimate the space density of interstellar comets .",
    "we assume that the comets have hyperbolic orbits with speed relative to the white dwarf of @xmath46 .",
    "if the comet impacts a white dwarf of radius @xmath47 and mass @xmath48 , then it is 100% accreted ; we assume there is no accretion from a near - miss .",
    "we treat the ambient interstellar iceballs as a continuous fluid with a hydrogen mass density , @xmath49 .",
    "because the escape speed from the surface of the white dwarf is much greater than @xmath46 , then the total mass of accreted hydrogen , @xmath50 is ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath51}{v_{wd}(t)}\\,dt\\ ] ] below , we describe how @xmath52 and @xmath46 may vary with time .    even before impact , incoming comets may split as they are heated and/or tidally disrupted .",

    "we therefore neglect the small deviations from the initial hyperbolic orbits that arise . in any case , the loss of some fragments that deviate away from a path that leads them into a direct collision is balanced by the gain of other fragments from parent bodies on a near - miss trajectory that deviate into a collision - course .    for simplicity , we assume @xmath46 is dominated by the white dwarf s space motion in the local standard of rest and we ignore the motions of the comets . assuming that only the motion vertical to the plane varies significantly with time , we write : @xmath53 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 having their conventional meanings . we adopt the simplifying assumption that relative to the galactic plane a star undergoes vertical simple harmonic motion @xcite @xmath57 with @xmath58 = 2.3 @xmath1 10@xmath59 s@xmath10 @xcite ,",

    ", @xmath11 could be as high as 24,800 k @xcite or as low as 19,000 k @xcite .",
    "while the frequency of externally - polluted  warm \" dbs appears to be low compared to the cooler dbs , further measurements should be performed since the spectra obtained by @xcite are not as sensitive to heavy atoms as those obtained by @xcite .",
    "ultraviolet spectroscopy is a sensitive tool to measure heavy elements in a white dwarf s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "data from the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ and the _ hubble space telescope _ have been obtained for 5 dbs warmer than 22,000 k : gd 190 , bpm 17088 , ec 20058 - 5234 @xcite , pg 0112 + 104 @xcite and gd 358 @xcite .",
    "although these stars possess atmospheric carbon , it is almost certain that this heavy element is intrinsic to the star and not accreted ( fontaine & brassard 2005 , desharnais et al .",
    "2008 ) . with the models of @xcite , the upper limits to the iron abundance found by @xcite and the assumption that 1/3 of the accreted mass is iron as seems appropriate for extrasolar asteroids @xcite , then in gd 190 , for example , the upper limit to the heavy atom accretion rate is @xmath31 @xmath1 10@xmath23 g s@xmath10 , a value lower than any reported by @xcite for polluted cooler dbs",
    ". therefore ultraviolet results are more sensitive than optical studies for identifying pollution .",
    "if each ultraviolet targeted db has at least a 30% probability of experiencing pollution , as found by @xcite for cool dbs , then the total probability that all 5 atars are uncontaminated is less than ( 0.7)@xmath9 or 16% .",
    "future observations of warm dbs may further test the prediction that these stars do not accrete ice - rich asteroids .",
    "the warmest da known to have a dust disk is sdss 1228 + 1040 with @xmath11 = 22,600 k @xcite .",
    "discovery of additional warm das with dust and then measuring their pollution may help extend the argument described in section 2 to constrain the mass loss rates from such stars .",
    "in our toy model described in section 2 , we have treated hydrogen accretion as a minor perturbation in a db atmosphere .",
    "in fact , it may take only @xmath3 10@xmath7 g of hydrogen to prevent the conversion of a da into a db for stars warmer than 22,000 k by dredge - up of interior helium @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for cooler stars with much more massive helium convective zones , considerably more hydrogen may be required to prevent the conversion from das to dbs @xcite .",
    "the fraction of all white dwarfs that are dbs with @xmath11 between 25,000 k and 40,000 k is a factor of 2.5 less than the same fraction of dbs with @xmath11 between 16,000 k and 22,000 k @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the systems with ice - rich asteroids accrete enough hydrogen to prevent a white dwarf from becoming a db until the temperature falls appreciably below 22,000 k.    our supposition that the oort cloud is unusually massive is consistent with the previous suggestion by @xcite , and the picture that the solar system is somewhat special .",
    "the orbital eccentricities of our planets are unusually low @xcite and extrasolar analogs to the late heavy bombardment appear to be rare @xcite .",
    "we identify a subclass of warm dbs where accretion of asteroids , analogs to oort clouds comets and interstellar gas all appear to be negligible .",
    "we make the plausible argument that the wind mass loss rate these stars is less than 10@xmath23 g s@xmath10 .",
    "if these stars have their nominal effective temperatures , it then follows that because they have accumulated only a small mass of hydrogen , interstellar comets with radii between 10 m and 2 km a contain less than 1% of all interstellar oxygen .",
    " optimistic \" scenarios for the formation of the solar system s oort cloud may not apply to most other stars .",
