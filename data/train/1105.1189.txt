    "quantum vortices in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are topologically stable excitations of the superfluid matter wave field that carry angular momentum  @xcite . unless the system is rotating sufficiently fast , vortices are thermodynamically unstable  @xcite . at finite temperatures the thermal cloud can provide a source of dissipation and noise , and hence allow vortex decay . however , there is currently little understanding of the decay mechanism and its timescale .",
    "the dynamics of vortices in such systems is therefore of interest as a robust test of non - equilibrium field theory .",
    "a number of different methods have been developed to describe the dynamics of vortices in finite - temperature systems .",
    "single vortex decay has been simulated using the zaremba - nikuni - griffin formalism @xcite , the classical field method @xcite , and within a gross - pitaevskii theory with phenomenological damping  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the thermal instability has also been studied within a variational approach  @xcite to the stochastic gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite .",
    "classical vortices can support long - wavelength helical traveling waves known as kelvin waves  @xcite .",
    "superfluid kelvin waves , or kelvons  @xcite , have long be studied in helium  @xcite , and more recently have become a topic of interest in becs .",
    "the kelvon excitation mechanism has been theoretically investigated @xcite , along with the microscopic dynamics of coherently excited kelvin waves  @xcite , with results consistent with the experimental evidence for kelvons @xcite .",
    "similar bending waves have also been shown to play an important role in the instability of vortex rings in trapped becs @xcite .    while the coherent excitation of kelvin modes in a bec is well understood , their role in the finite - temperature system is largely unexplored .",
    "here we show that the thermal activation of kelvin waves is a dominant factor in the decay of a vortex for a finite - temperature three - dimensional ( 3d ) bec .",
    "the underlying reason is that kelvin waves cause the vortex to wobble and emit acoustic radiation , thus allowing the vortex to more effectively dissipate energy , and hence decay by moving out to the boundary of the bec . as kelvin waves are fundamentally 3d excitations of the vortex line",
    ", they may be suppressed by flattening the system ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , beyond a certain oblateness we find that the kelvon mode contribution is essentially frozen out and the vortex decay rate reduces to a geometrically - invariant value , characterizing a regime of two - dimensional vortex ( 2dv ) dynamics .",
    "we also find that for tighter traps and higher temperatures the matter wave itself crosses over to being quasi-2d and we find a dynamical signature of the phase - fluctuating condensate : an anomalous increase in the rate of vortex decay .    as a further application of these concepts , we model a recent experiment  @xcite studying vortex dipoles in the 2dv regime , confirming the 2dv behavior in finite temperature dynamics .",
    "the decay characteristics are found to be qualitatively very different from 3d dipole decay which exhibits vortex ring and loop formation , accelerating the damping process .",
    "our theoretical framework for studying this system is the stochastic projected gross - pitaevskii equation ( spgpe )  @xcite , which is a grand - canonical c - field method  @xcite ( also see @xcite for related theories ) .",
