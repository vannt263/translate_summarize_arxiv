    "in the area of quantum information processing substantial efforts are being devoted to exploit the magnetic properties of molecular systems in order to realize quantum logic operations.@xcite in a recent proposal for entangling two nuclear spins using a photo - excited transient electron spin,@xcite the strength of the hyperfine interaction ( hfi ) has been identified as a key parameter determining the entanglement efficiency .",
    "these investigations raise the question on how to optimize such parameters , and how to design new materials with tailored magnetic properties for specific quantum logic operations .",
    "first - principles calculations based on density - functional theory ( dft ) have recently met with a number of successes in the calculation of the magnetic properties of materials , in particular when it comes to the building blocks of the spin hamiltonian such as chemical shifts,@xcite j - couplings,@xcite and g - tensors.@xcite as magnetic spin resonance experimental techniques become more accurate , and novel applications to physics , biology , and materials science are being explored,@xcite dft - based modelling of charge / spin interactions hold the promise of becoming a key player in the interpretation of measured magnetic responses and in the design of materials with tailored functionality .    in this work we aim to establish the validity and accuracy of dft - based modelling in the calculation of hfi parameters in a class of materials of interest for quantum information technology .",
    "we here focus on the hfi interactions in the fullerene derivatives synthesized in ref .",
    ", since electron spin resonance measurements on these materials have already been performed .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.qip ] we briefly review the connection between the hfi parameters and the efficiency of the quantum entanglement operations introduced in ref .  .",
    "in sec .  [ sec.computation ] we describe the computational methodology that we employ for calculating hyperfine tensors . in sec .",
    "[ sec.results.a ] we discuss our hfi calculations for a series of small radicals . in this section",
    "we establish the accuracy and reliability of pseudopotential ( pp ) calculations of the hfi by comparing with all - electron ( ae ) calculations and with experiment . in sec .",
    "[ sec.results.b ] we present our calculations of the hfi on photo - excited fullerene derivatives , and we discuss our results in light of the entanglement protocol proposed in ref .  .",
    "[ sec.conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in ref .   a quantum information processing protocol involving nuclear spins has been introduced .",
    "this protocol involves the interaction of two nuclear spins attached to a fullerene molecule through functional additions carrying isotopically labeled nuclei .",
    "the ground state of this fullerene derivative is spin - unpolarized , and hence the hfi of the nuclear spins is vanishing . upon optical excitation a spin - triplet excitonic state",
    "is generated in the molecule , and the nuclear spins interact with the spin - polarized electrons leading to a non - vanishing hyperfine coupling . as a result the two nuclear spins experience an interaction which is mediated by the spin of the exciton .",
    "such interaction can be used to perform an entanglement operation between the two nuclear spins .",
    "when the exciton decays and the fullerene reverts to its spin - unpolarized ground state , the nuclear spins may remain entangled .",
    "the efficiency of this protocol results from the competition between three timescales : ( i ) the time required to perform the entanglement operation , ( ii ) the exciton lifetime , and ( iii ) the decoherence time of the entangled state.@xcite the competition between these timescales defines an optimum range of hfi strength for achieving maximum entanglement .    in order to establish the feasibility of the protocol proposed in ref .",
    ", pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance experiments were performed on a prototype system , the fullerene diethyl malonate molecule [ c@xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2o@xmath3 , system m1 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "although this system carries only one isotopically labeled nuclear spin associated with the @xmath4c atom of the functional group directly bonded to the cage , it was possible to extract relevant information such as the lifetimes of the exciton states and the hfi parameters .",
    "for the system considered the measured relaxation rates of 90 - 100 @xmath5s at 20 - 50 k correspond to maximum entangling power when the hfi parameters are in the range 2 mhz to 12 mhz , with an optimal value of 6 mhz.@xcite the measured hfi parameter of 3  mhz in this prototype system with a single nuclear spin falls within the optimum theoretical range and motivates further work in this area .",
    "the key open question which remains is how to identify systems involving multiple nuclear spins and exhibiting optimal hfi strengths .",
    "one possible route for answering such question is to employ first - principles materials modelling based on density - functional theory in order to screen candidate systems prior to their experimental synthesis . accordingly , in the present work we aim at establishing the accuracy of such first - principles calculations , in view of optimizing and designing functional materials for spin - based quantum information processing .",
    "the coupling of the electron spin @xmath6 to a set of @xmath7 nuclear spins @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) can be described using the following hyperfine hamiltonian:@xcite @xmath10 @xmath11 being the hyperfine coupling tensor associated with the @xmath12-th nucleus at the site @xmath13 . in atomic units",
    "the hyperfine tensor can be written as:@xcite @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 in these equations @xmath17 is the electron spin density , @xmath18 the free - electron g - factor , @xmath19 the bohr magneton , @xmath20 the gyromagnetic ratio of the @xmath12-th nucleus and @xmath21 the nuclear magneton . in eq .",

    "@xmath29 the electron spin - density is weighted by the factor @xmath30 and the contributions outside of the core region are dominant . in the fermi contact term the electron spin density must be evaluated at the position of the nucleus , therefore an accurate description of the electron density within the core region is essential .",
    "while standard pseudopotential methods can be used for calculating the dipole - dipole term @xmath29 , the calculation of the fermi contact contribution requires the use of all - electron methods or the projected augmented wave ( paw ) method.@xcite the paw method enables the reconstruction of the all - electron wavefunction inside the core region , starting from a pseudopotential calculation of the valence electronic structure , and has successfully been applied to the calculation of hyperfine parameters.@xcite      in ref .",
    "we reported a preliminary calculation of the isotropic component of the hfi tensor of the m1 system [ fig .",

    "we perform pseudopotential ( pp ) density - functional theory calculations within the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite we describe the valence electronic wavefunctions using a planewaves basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 70 ry .",
    "we take into account the core - valence interaction using troulier - martins normconserving pseudopotentials.@xcite for the calculation of the hfi tensor we use the gauge - including projector - augmented wave method ( gipaw ) of ref .  .",
    "we use periodic simulation cells , and in order to minimize interactions between periodic replicas of the molecules , we use cells of size 12   for the small molecules , and cells of size up to 24   for the fullerene derivatives .",
    "all pp calculations are performed using the quantum - espresso software package.@xcite    for the calculation of the fermi contact term , the accurate description of the electronic wavefunctions in the core region is required . in pseudopotential methods only valence electrons",
    "are described , and in some cases this might lead to significant errors due to the neglect of core polarization effects .",
    "core polarization refers to the spin polarization of core electrons induced by the spin of valence electrons , and leads to an additional contribution to the fermi contact term.@xcite within pp calculations we introduce core polarization corrections using the perturbative approach of ref .   as follows . for each atom with core electrons ( c and o )",
    "we calculate the spherical average of the spin density around the nuclues up to a radius of 5 a.u . using a logarithmic radial grid .",
    "this average is used to evaluate the perturbation @xmath34 due to valence polarization following eq .",
    "( 20 ) of ref .  , and subsequently the contribution to the fermi contact term arising from the core polarization using eq .",
    "( 17 ) of ref .  .",
    "the atomic all - electron wavefunctions are stored in the pseudopotentials files and the integrations are carried out on the radial grid . in the following , pseudopotential calculations including the core polarization correction will be referred as `` pp - cp '' , while those without core polarization will be denoted simply by `` pp '' . in the case of light atoms such as those considered in this work relativistic effects",
    "are expected to be negligible , therefore we generated the pseudopotentials by solving the non - relativistic schrdinger equation ( it is custom practice to solve the scalar - relativistic equation only for atoms starting from the fourth row of the periodic table ) . in evaluating the fermi contact term , the first relativistic correction can be taken into account through a spherical integration of the spin density up to the thomson radius  @xmath35 , which provides an estimate of the finite size of the nucleus .",
    "however , the thomson radii of h and c fall around the first point of our pseudopotential radial grid , therefore it seems more appropriate to evaluate the spin density at the nucleus ( this is done by extrapolating the three innermost values on the grid ) .    in order to establish the accuracy of pp calculations of hfi parameters we also perform ae calculations using the pbe exchange and correlation , as implemented in the gaussian 09 program package.@xcite for the ae calculation of the hfi tensor we adopt the epr - ii basis , which has been purposely designed to accurately describe the fermi contact term.@xcite    in order to study the hfi in optically - excited fullerene derivatives we perform calculations using the ground state of the @xmath36 electron spin configuration .",
    "in fact , while density - functional theory does not describe correctly excited states , the lowest spin - triplet state of c@xmath0 , with the homo and lumo states singly occupied with parallel spins , is the ground state of the @xmath36 spin configuration , hence the use of dft is legitimate.@xcite    for each structure m1-b3 shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] we optimize several initial geometries in both the singlet @xmath37 and triplet @xmath36 configurations in order to identify the corresponding ground state .",
    "the energy difference between the triplet and the singlet states ranges from 1.29 to 1.33 ev across all the models considered .",
    "this result is in agreement with the measured excitation energy of 1.30 ev of the non - functionalized fullerene c@xmath0.@xcite this suggests that our description of the lowest triplet exciton state is adequate .",
    ".[table1 ] fermi contact hyperfine coupling parameters of small molecules containing c , and h. we report calculations using the gipaw method without accounting for core - polarization effects ( pp ) , calculations within gipaw including core - polarization corrections ( pp - cp ) , all - electron calculations ( ae ) , and measured fermi contact parameters .",
    "the atoms are listed according to corresponding chemical formula . [ cols= \" < , < , < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , < \" , ]     [ tableiii ]    it is interesting to observe in table [ table3 ] that the location of the diethyl malonate adduct has a significant effect on the hfi parameters , leading to variations of up to an order of magnitude in the fermi contact term",
    ".    for both the trans-1 isomer b1 and the trans-3 isomer b3 table [ table3 ] shows that the two @xmath4c nuclei have the same hfi tensor . at variance with this , in the equatorial conformer b2 only one nucleus exhibits a sizeable hfi . in order to rationalize this finding",
    "we examine the structural parameters of each fullerene derivative . figure .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the geometry of the diethyl malonate adducts on the c@xmath0 cage .",
    "the structure of the adducts ( i.e.  bond lengths and bond angles ) are almost identical in each fullerene derivative .",
    "the only noticeable difference is that the length of the c - c bond bridging the adduct to the fullerene is @xmath38    for both adducts in the structures b1 and b3 , while in the structure b2 the two adducts have different c - c bond lengths of 1.60 and 1.57  , respectively .",
    "this indicates that in the equatorial conformer b2 one of the two nuclear spins is closer than the other to the c@xmath0 cage .",
    "since the spin density is largest on the fullerene cage , the nuclear spin with the shorter c - c bond length can be expected to exhibit a larger hfi strength , consistent with the results in table [ table3 ] .    in ref .",
    "it was shown that , in systems like the structures b1 - 3 considered here , it should be possible to achieve the entanglement of the two nuclear spins if the following conditions are fulfilled : ( i ) the fermi contact interaction when the system is photo - excited to its triplet state is in the range 2 - 16  mhz .",
    "( ii ) the two isotopically labeled c nuclei exhibit a very similar strength of the hfi .",
    "table [ table3 ] shows that , on the one hand , the trans-1 b1 and the equatorial b2 isomers do not fulfill at least one of these requirements . on the other hand",
    ", the trans-3 b3 isomer fulfills both criteria , and hence it represents a promising candidate for nuclear spin entanglement .",
    "this finding is particularly interesting since the b3 structure can be produced with the relatively high yield of 12% ( cf .",
    "[ sec.systems ] ) .",
    "in this work we perform calculations of the hyperfine couling tensor for photo - excited fullerene derivatives of interest in spin - based quantum information processing .",
    "we report extensive validation of pseudopotential methods against all - electron calculations and experimental data for a series of small radicals .",
    "a key observation is that pp calculations can deliver an accuracy comparable to ae calculations , provided the effect of core polarization is included .",
    "we investigate the hfi strength in a series of photo - excited diethyl malonate fullerene derivates , which are potential candidates for nuclear spin entanglement operations .",
    "we clarify the relation between the calculated hfi parameters and the underlying atomic - scale structure of these systems .",
    "we identify one particular structure , the trans-3 isomer b3 , as the best match to the entanglement criteria set in ref .  .",
    "the fullerene derivative thus identified can be produced with relatively high yield and thus represents a potential candidate for achieving the entanglement of two nuclear spins in a photo - excited chromophore .",
    "our work provides a set of validation tests and benchmarks for future calculations of hfi parameters using pseudopotential methods .",
