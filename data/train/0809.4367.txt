    "tropical geometry is a  fairly recent new field within the broader context of algebraic geometry . during the time which elapsed since its inception",
    ", tropical geometry has already developed its language and its methods , and has furthermore found numerous applications ; we refer the interested reader to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) , and more recently to @xcite , for both applications and the general background information .",
    "some spaces arising in tropical geometry are of interest from the point of view of algebraic topology as well . often these have natural definitions and fit well in more general structures .",
    "one such instance is furnished by the moduli spaces of rational tropical curves of genus  @xmath1 with @xmath2 marked points @xmath0 , which were introduced by mikhalkin in  @xcite , see also @xcite for a  purely topological definition .    prior to this work , only the case of genus @xmath12",
    "has been studied systematically , see @xcite , where , e.g. , the homology groups with coefficients in @xmath13 were computed for this family of spaces . in this paper , we present an  in - depth analysis of the moduli spaces of rational tropical curves of higher genus .    as a  first step ,",
    "we complement the known shrinking bridges strong deformation retraction , leading from @xmath0 to @xmath14 as described in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) , by a  further new simplification . on the intuitive level ,",
    "that newly discovered strong deformation retraction increases the edge lengths proportionally , to reach the length of the longest one , stopping when the edges which are strictly shorter than the longest one form a  forest .",
    "this process is described in detail in section  [ sect:2 ] , where we reduce the space @xmath14 to @xmath15 without changing the homotopy type ( here @xmath16 stands for `` equalisation '' ) .    by global scaling of edge lengths",
    ", we can replace @xmath15 by a  compact space @xmath4 , and then proceed with finding more structure in that new space .",
    "hereafter , our main structural achievements are the represention of @xmath4 as a  homotopy colimit of a  diagram of topological spaces in section  [ sect:3 ] , and the derivation from that representation of a  cw complex decomposition of @xmath4 in section  [ sect:4 ] .",
    "there are several byproducts of that development .",
    "the main one is probably the discovery in section  [ sect:3 ] of a  family of generalized simplicial complexes @xmath5 , where @xmath1 is any natural number .",
    "the vertices of @xmath5 are indexed by the isomorphism classes of stable graphs of genus  @xmath1 , and , more generally , the simplices are indexed by filtrations by forests of these graphs .",
    "another byproduct is the introduction of cubical complexes ( or , in some terminology , of _ generalized _ cubical complexes ) @xmath17 in section  [ sect:4 ] .",
    "each such complex is defined using a  filtered by forests stable graph as the input data .",
    "the interesting question of connections between combinatorial properties of the input graphs and geometry of the corresponding cubical complexes arises in a  natural way .",
    "we then use in section  [ sect:5 ] and in section  [ sect:6 ] the previous developments to analyze the cases of genus @xmath6 and  @xmath7 . in the case when genus is equal to  @xmath6 , we completely understand the topology of moduli spaces when the number of marked points is @xmath18 , @xmath12 , or  @xmath6 . furthermore , using an  euler characteristic formula derived using some standard enumeration under group action techniques , we can show that these moduli spaces are almost never contractible .",
    "due to explosion in complexity , much less can be said in the case of genus equal to  @xmath7 .",
    "the main results here are the collapsibility of the generalized simplicial complex @xmath19 , and the determination of the asymptotics ( with respect to the number of marked points @xmath2 ) of the euler characteristic of @xmath4 .",
    "the latter leads then to a  conjecture concerning all genuses  @xmath1 .",
    "to start with , a few words on the terminology are in place . for a  poset @xmath20",
    ", we denote the order complex by @xmath21 . for a  graph @xmath22",

    "furthermore , graphs satisfying the following additional properties will play special role in this paper .",
    "a graph @xmath22 is called * stable * if    * it has no bridges , * no vertex of @xmath22 has valency  @xmath6 , unless it is adjacent to a  loop .    due to the space constraints",

    "a  standard situation in which ordered set partitions arise is when we have a  function @xmath31 , and we let @xmath30 be the non - empty preimages @xmath32 , @xmath33 , for @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 .",

    "now , the objects of @xmath44 are precisely all filtered graphs , and morphisms are filtered graph homomorphisms . as usual in category theory we call the invertible morphisms the _ isomorphisms_.",
    "this gives the notion of _ isomorphic filtered graphs_. being isomorphic is an  equivalence relation , and thus we have a  notion of _ isomorphism classes _ of filtered graphs .",

    "we would like to remark that omitting the order , and considering pairs @xmath36 , where @xmath22 is a  graph , and @xmath58 is a  usual set partition of @xmath38 , will yield a  parallel concept of _ partitioned graphs_. a _ partitioned graph homomorphism _ between @xmath36 and @xmath45 is a  graph homomorphism @xmath53 , such that for any two edges @xmath54 the following condition is satisfied : if @xmath61 and @xmath62 belong to the same block of @xmath58 , then @xmath63 and @xmath64 belong to the same block of  @xmath59 .",

    "as in general case , it is now sufficient to understand the space @xmath431 . according to theorem  [ thm : main ] that space is a  homotopy colimit shown on the left hand side of figure  [ fig : g22 ] .",
    "the groups on that figure are as follows :    * the group @xmath432 consists of the flips of the loops , with a  possible swap of the two loops ; it has cardinality @xmath433 and is isomorphic to the wreath product of @xmath434 with @xmath434 ; * the group @xmath435 is generated by reflections of the graph with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes ; it has cardinality @xmath176 and is isomorphic to the direct product of @xmath434 with @xmath434 ; * the group @xmath436 is generated by @xmath437 permuting the edges and the reflection with respect to the horizontal axis ; it has cardinality @xmath438 and is isomorphic to the direct product of @xmath437 with @xmath434 .",
    "we again used the hollow circles to denote the points inserted in the midpoints of edges , as is prescribed by the group actions ; in fact here , we simply need to subdivide all the edges .",
    "as elaborated on in section  [ sect : cw ] these subdivisions induce a  cw structure on the homotopy colimit . for @xmath427 , this structure coincides with the generalized simplicial complex @xmath5 , so here we simply get a  @xmath12-simplex .    for @xmath428",
    "we get the diagram of spaces shown on the right hand side of figure  [ fig : g22 ] . in that diagram , the map corresponding to the diagonal arrow pointing southwest shrinks the edge @xmath439 to the point @xmath248 , and maps the edge @xmath440 homeomorphically to the edge @xmath61 , whereas the map corresponding to the diagonal arrow pointing southeast takes the vertex @xmath441 to @xmath442 , and maps both edges @xmath439 and @xmath440 homeomorphically to the edge @xmath62 .",
    "the homotopy colimit of this diagram is the cell complex of dimension @xmath6 , shown on figure  [ fig : g23 ] . clearly , that complex is collapsible in the sense of @xcite , in particular , it is contractible .",

    "we start by understanding the cubical structure of the spaces @xmath239 , @xmath240 , and @xmath445 , all of which are @xmath6-dimensional pure cubical complexes .    the case of the cubical complex @xmath239 is illustrated on figure  [ fig : g2n2a ] . here",
    "the filtered by forests stable graph @xmath36 consists of one vertex and two loops of length @xmath12 .",
    "the subdivided space @xmath345 is shown on the left hand side of figure  [ fig : g2n2a ] , where also notations for vertices and edges are fixed . using these notations",
    "we describe the cubes of @xmath239 .",
    "each one is described by two letters , corresponding to the allowed loci of the points marked @xmath12 and @xmath6 ( in that order ) .",
    "thus , the complex @xmath239 has    @xmath446 , @xmath447 , @xmath448 , @xmath449 , @xmath450 ;    @xmath451 , @xmath452 , @xmath453 , @xmath454 , @xmath455 , @xmath456 ;    @xmath457 , @xmath458 , @xmath459 ;    where we of course only list one of the equivalent descriptions for each cube , for example @xmath460 , and @xmath461 .",
    "we see from the figure  [ fig : g2n2a ] that the @xmath6-cubes @xmath462 and @xmath463 have common boundary , and hence form a  @xmath6-sphere ; and that the @xmath6-cube @xmath464 is attached to that @xmath6-sphere along two neighboring sides .",
    "we conclude that @xmath239 is homotopy equivalent to a  @xmath6-sphere .",
    "next we describe the cubical complex @xmath240 .",
    "the corresponding subdivided filtered by forests stable graph is shown on the left hand side of figure  [ fig : g2n2b ] . with the notations there , the complex @xmath240 has    @xmath446 , @xmath465 @xmath447 , @xmath448 , @xmath449 , @xmath450 ;    @xmath451 , @xmath452 , @xmath466 , @xmath467 , @xmath453 , @xmath454 , @xmath455 , @xmath456 ;    @xmath457 , @xmath458 , @xmath459 , @xmath468 ;    where we again list only one of the equivalent descriptions for each cube .",

    "finally , we describe the cubical complex @xmath445 .",
    "the corresponding subdivided filtered by forests stable graph is shown in the middle of figure  [ fig : g2n2c ] . with the notations there ,",

    "the @xmath6-cubes in each group , when glued , form a  @xmath6-cube , and all these @xmath7 new @xmath6-cubes have a  common boundary .",
    "thus , we conclude that the complex @xmath445 is homeomorphic to a  @xmath6-sphere with a  disc glued in , which in turn , is homotopy equivalent to a  wedge of two @xmath6-spheres @xmath491 .    as part of the analysis of the maps @xmath492 and @xmath493 ,",
    "we show in table  [ tab:1 ] what their values on @xmath6-cubes ; there we use @xmath494 to denote lower - dimensional cubes .",
    "we invite the reader to get the geometric intuition for what these maps actually do to the spaces .",
    "[ hbt]@xmath495    we are now ready to prove the following result .",

    "it follows from our detailed descriptions of the cubical structures on @xmath239 , @xmath240 , and @xmath445 , that we have inclusions @xmath500 and @xmath501 .",

    "furthermore , the quotient maps @xmath506 , @xmath507 , and @xmath508 , induce a  diagram map @xmath289 from @xmath509 to @xmath510 .    as is clear from our explicit description , all three complexes @xmath497 , @xmath498 , and @xmath499 , are contractible .",
    "since inclusions of cw subcomplexes are cofibrations , see e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 0.17 ) , it follows that the maps @xmath511 , @xmath512 , and @xmath513 , are homotopy equivalences . using theorem  [ thm : homlem ] ( homotopy lemma ) ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath289 induces a  homotopy equivalence between the homotopy colimits of these two diagrams .    by our construction and previous developments the homotopy colimit of @xmath509 is homotopy equivalent to the tropical module space @xmath496 .",
    "on the other hand , the spaces @xmath514 and @xmath515 are each homeomorphic to a  @xmath6-sphere , whereas the space @xmath516 is homeomorphic to a  wedge of @xmath6-spheres @xmath491 .",
    "the map @xmath517 shrinks one of the spheres in the wedge to a  point and maps the other one homeomorphically to @xmath518 , while the map @xmath519 maps both @xmath6-spheres in @xmath445 homeomorphically to @xmath520 .",
    "hence the homotopy colimit of @xmath510 is homeomorphic to the space obtained from a  cone over @xmath521 by taking an edge connecting the apex to one of the points in the base , dividing this edge in the middle and identifying the two halves with each other by a  reflection about the middle point , see figure  [ fig : g2n2f ] . in particular , it is contractible , and we have therefore proved the theorem .",
    "@xmath27    let us now calculate of the euler characteristic , and more generally , the generating function for the number of cells of @xmath431 .",
    "this can be done using the formula  . for this , we need to calculate @xmath522 , for all filtered by forests stable graphs of genus @xmath6 , and all @xmath523 .",
    "that information is summarized in tables on figures  [ fig : mf1 ] , [ fig : mf2 ] , and [ fig : mf3 ] , corresponding to the three different filtered by forests stable graphs of genus  @xmath6 . on figure",
    "[ fig : mf3 ] we use the convention that @xmath524    we conclude that @xmath525 and hence @xmath526 for all nonnegative integers @xmath2 . for small values of @xmath2",
    "we get @xmath527 in particular , we conclude that @xmath431 is not contractible for all @xmath528 . at present , it is unknown whether @xmath529 is contractible or not .",
    "[ sect:6 ]      @xmath27    as was shown in proposition  [ prop:3.4 ] , the generalized simplicial complex @xmath19 is pure , and it has dimension  @xmath176 .",

    "therefore , deletion of the vertex @xmath531 along with all the adjacent simplices corresponds to a  ( non - elementary ) simplicial collapse .",
    "let us denote by @xmath402 the thus obtained generalized simplicial complex .",
    "it is enough to show that this complex is collapsible .",
    "we notice that the closed star of the vertex @xmath534 constitutes the entire complex @xmath402 .",

    "these complexes are shown on figures  [ fig : g32 ] and [ fig : g33 ] , from which it is apparent that there are various ways to collapse each one to a  point .",
    "@xmath27    let us now show that @xmath538 , that is @xmath539 converges to a  constant , as @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "we use the formula  .",
    "the nontrivial contributions from different cells of @xmath19 are summarized on figure  [ fig : g34 ] , where we list the contributions below corresponding cells .",
    "summing up we see that the final answer is  @xmath540 .",

    "it would also be interesting to find an  interpretation for the actual coefficient of @xmath552 , the values which we have computed are @xmath553 , @xmath554 , @xmath540 .",
    "though having gained a  substantial advance in our understanding of the structure of the spaces @xmath4 , and thus of the homotopy type of the moduli spaces of rational tropical curves @xmath0 , quite a  few questions remain open .",
    "for example , it seems natural to conjecture that @xmath5 is not always contractible , and it would be interesting to find out whether that phenomenon occurs already for @xmath555 . at the moment , not much is known about @xmath556 beyond the fact that it has @xmath557 vertices , whose indexing stable graphs of genus @xmath176 are shown on figure  [ fig : g4 ] .",
    "furthermore , adding the marked points into the fray , makes for a  lot more questions .",
    "as a  first concrete one , we would like to know whether @xmath529 is contractible or not .",
    "in general , it certainly feels like the spaces @xmath4 should always never be contractible , so settling conjecture  [ conj : as ] seems useful .    in section  [ sect:5 ] we could understand the homotopy type of the space @xmath10 by coming up with some deformations of the spaces in the diagram @xmath330 , and using the homotopy lemma .",
