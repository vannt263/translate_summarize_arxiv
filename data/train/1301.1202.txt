    "the refractive index is usually used to describe the propagation of light through a medium , but it can also be applied to the propagation of matter waves through a dilute gas . in that case , the refractive index is a complex quantity that depends on collisions between the particles of the propagating wave and the gas @xcite . the refractive index can be measured using atom or molecule interferometry and can help to determine properties of atom - atom or atom - molecule interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "it is proportional to the complex forward scattering amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "the imaginary part describes the attenuation of the beam and is related to the total scattering cross section , while the real part is associated with the phase shift due to the interaction between projectile particles and atoms or molecules of the buffer gas .",

    "subsequent experiments led to the observation of glory oscillations in the index of refraction as a function of the beam velocity for sodium matter waves in a medium of noble gases or nitrogen @xcite , and to the investigation of na@xmath0 matter waves @xcite .",

    "the brackets @xmath14 denote a thermal averaging over the distribution of target atom velocities .",
    "the real part of the refractive index is related to the phase shift accumulated by the matter wave due to scattering with the gas , while the imaginary part corresponds to the attenuation of the beam .",

    "however , for the system under consideration we found that the discrepancy between the two formulas was small even at low projectile velocities .    while the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index can in some cases be measured accurately @xcite , it is useful to define the quantity @xmath15 as the ratio of the phase shift to the attenuation , @xmath16 the main advantage of measuring @xmath15 instead of @xmath17 is that it is independent of the gas density @xcite .",
    "while the projectile atoms have a definite velocity , this is not the case for the target atoms and a thermal averaging must be carried out .",

    "n@xmath0 elastic collision cross section @xcite occurs because they are suppressed by the averaging over the thermal distribution , as found for other systems @xcite .",
    "the averaging depends on the temperature as well as on the mass of the target , and the damping would be weaker for heavier particles or for lower temperatures .",
    "however , even with a temperature lower than 300 k , glory oscillations still would not be observable for the range of velocities used in the experiment .",

    "these distributions probe the scattering amplitude in the region where no glory oscillations are present , so that the averaging of @xmath70 does not yield any oscillations in @xmath54 .",

    "the scattering amplitude also shows a resonance structure at energies below the depth of the potential ( 27 @xmath27 ) , which has been discussed in ref .",

    "apart from the difference in mass , which modifies the thermal distribution ( [ mb_distrib2 ] ) , the most obvious consequence of using molecules as projectiles is that if the molecules can be prepared in a definite rovibrational level , then an interferometry experiment could lead to insights into the nature of the interaction potential involving those specific levels",
