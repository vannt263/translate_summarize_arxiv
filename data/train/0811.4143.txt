    "the noise associated with @xmath25 is then given by @xmath26 since @xmath27 , @xmath28 is real .",
    "alternatively , one could also consider the difference between the currents flowing into the dot from the two leads , @xmath29 for which @xmath30.@xcite the fluctuations in this difference account for the fluctuations in the _ net charge _ accumulating on the dot .",
    "the noise associated with this charge is given by @xmath31    earlier theoretical papers considered various aspects of noise correlations in mesoscopic systems .",
    "some of these studies analyzed only the low frequency limit of the spectrum , which reduces to the johnson - nyquist noise at equilibrium ( i.e. at zero bias voltage ) and to the shot noise at a finite bias .",
    "specifically , chen and ting@xcite studied the un - symmetrized noise associated with the net terminal current [ our eq . (",
    "[ i m ] ) ] , and found a lorentzian peak around zero frequency for a bias which is larger than the resonance level width .",

    "recently , two of us participated in a detailed analysis of @xmath32 in the limit of zero temperature and zero bias.@xcite ignoring interactions and capacitance effects , which might add correlations among the currents at relatively high frequencies,@xcite it is convenient to use the single electron scattering formalism for obtaining explicit expressions for the noise spectrum.@xcite similar to ref .  ,",
    "ref .   found that the current noise spectrum @xmath32 has a step structure as a function of the frequency , with the step edges located roughly at energies corresponding to the resonances of the quantum dot .",
    "it was consequently suggested that the noise spectrum can be used to probe the resonance levels of the dot .",
    "for the two level quantum dot , ref .   also found dips in the noise spectrum , which appeared when the fermi energy was between the two levels and deepened upon increasing the asymmetry of the coupling of the dot to the leads .",
    "the present paper generalizes ref .",
    ", by introducing a finite bias and and a finite temperature , and by considering also the charge noise .",
    "in particular , we discuss the interesting dependence of the various spectra on the spatial asymmetry , denoted by @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) denote the broadening of the resonance on the dot due to its coupling with the left ( right ) lead .",
    "we find that the single step appearing in @xmath36 in the absence of the bias @xcite splits in the presence of @xmath37 into two steps when the resonance energy @xmath38 is not between the two chemical potentials ( @xmath39 ) and into four steps when it is within that range .",
    "in addition , @xmath40 vanishes at @xmath41 , exhibiting a dip in the shot noise around @xmath41 . for @xmath42 and for @xmath43 there also appears a _ peak _ in @xmath32 at @xmath41 . at zero temperature and close to @xmath44",
