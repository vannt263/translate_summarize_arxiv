    "this work was carried out within the framework of analyzing social dynamics determined by democratic decisions in a stochastic environment .",
    "the subject of investigation is the relationship between the parameters of social dynamics and social strategies of the participants including egoism , collectivism ( corporatism ) and altruism .",
    "the results for the situation where a cohesive group competes with egoistic participants are reported in @xcite ; competition between egoists and two cohesive groups ( parties ) was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the latter paper also considers the so - called `` snowball of cooperation '' mechanism which , under certain conditions , motivates those participants initially having egoistic strategies to act altruistically .",
    "the present paper investigates a special case of the situation considered in @xcite , namely , competition of two groups .",
    "the relative simplicity of this case enables us to obtain explicit formulas for the most interesting relationships .",
    "let us recall the basic features of our model of voting in a stochastic environment .",
    "being composed of a finite number of participants , the society sequentially votes for / against proposals that are regularly generated by the `` environment '' according to a random law .",
    "a proposal is identified with a vector of capital increments of the participants ; an alternative interpretation involves the utility values of the participants . according to the model ,",
    "the capital / utility increments entering the proposal are realizations of independent and identically distributed random variables . here , the normal distribution is mainly considered . during the vote , an egoistic participant supports any proposal that increases his / her capital .",
    "in contrast to egoists , the members of a group vote jointly for those proposals that would be favorable for the whole group ( the latter is characterized by a certain index ) . in particular",
    ", a group may support proposals that increase either the capital of the majority of its members or the total group capital .",
    "each proposal is accepted ( and implemented ) or rejected under a particular voting procedure .",
    "generally , the procedures of @xmath0-majority are used .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 determines the share of votes necessary and sufficient for the acceptance of a proposal .",
    "the presence of a stochastic environment is the focus of the model under consideration ; it preserves many basic phenomena of social reality . at the same time",
    ", it enables the investigation of these phenomena by analytical methods .    in voting theory , the stochasticity assumption is often applied to choosing the voters positions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in cooperative game theory , it is widely adopted with respect to the payments  @xcite . a distinctive feature of our model is a stochastic mechanism for generating proposals for voting . in other words , we study a model of random walks controlled by voting . in this context , some papers on the dynamical correction of tax rates are relevant ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) ; note , however , that these works focus on selecting the rate itself ( which is optimized within special models of production and consumption ) and not on the random walks in the space of individual utilities .",
    "we also mention a recent survey on modelling political competition processes that involve voting  @xcite .",
    "suppose that a society consists of two groups of similar size ; every group votes jointly .",
    "a  natural voting rule requires that the accepted proposals are supported by both groups . in the sequel",
    ", we use the term _ unanimous acceptance group rule _ for this voting procedure .",
    "suppose that the first ( second ) group supports a proposal if and only if this proposal leads to the increase in the mean capital of the group members by at least @xmath2 ( respectively , @xmath3 ) . here , the _ proposal support thresholds _ @xmath2 and @xmath3 are variable parameters which may take positive , zero , or negative values .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the dependence of the future capital of the groups and the whole society on the proposal support thresholds @xmath2 and  @xmath3 ( we will also call them _ claim thresholds _ ) .",
    "in addition to the unanimous acceptance group rule , we will consider the rule according to which a proposal is accepted if and only if it is supported by at least one group .",
    "this voting procedure will be called the _ unanimous rejection group rule _ , since a proposal is rejected iff it is rejected by both groups . in the following theorem ,",
    "we derive expressions for the average capital increments under the above voting rules .",
    "suppose a proposal is accepted if and only if it is supported by at least one group .",
    "then the mathematical expectation of the one - step capital increment of a member of group @xmath4 @xmath5 is given by the formula @xmath6",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the density and distribution function of the standard normal distribution@xmath7 respectively@xmath7 and @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 is the claim threshold of group @xmath14 @xmath15 is the size of group @xmath14 while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the parameters of the normal distribution @xmath18 that describes the independent capital increments forming proposals .",
    "suppose a proposal is accepted if and only if it is supported by both groups .",
    "then the mathematical expectation of the one - step capital increment of a member of group @xmath4 @xmath5 is given by the formula @xmath19    for a given proposal , let @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) be the event that the first ( respectively , second ) group supports the proposal .",
    "denote by @xmath22 the simultaneous implementation of @xmath20 and @xmath23 similarly , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the simultaneous implementation of @xmath20 and the complement of @xmath26 and of the complements of @xmath20 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the event probability .    to prove the first statement of the theorem",
    ", we first suppose that the unanimous rejection group rule is used . using the total probability formula one has @xmath28    on the assumption of @xmath29 the proposal is rejected ; hence , @xmath30 . under @xmath31 ,",
    "the proposal is accepted and independence of the proposal components implies that @xmath32 . similarly , the proposal is accepted under @xmath33 , and independence of the components @xmath34 yields @xmath35 .",
    "next , @xmath36 with @xmath37 standing for the result of averaging the components of the proposal ( these components correspond to the @xmath4th group ) .",
    "observe that @xmath37 is a random variable having the distribution @xmath38 , where @xmath12 and that @xmath39 is tantamount to @xmath40 using the formula for the conditional mean of a normal random variable ( it can be proved by integration ) one finally obtains @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 it is also easy to demonstrate that @xmath45 . using independence of the proposal components we have the expression @xmath46 substituting all this into([eq3 ] ) yields @xmath47 this completes the proof of the first part .",
    "now prove the second statement of the theorem .",
    "suppose that the unanimous acceptance group rule is used . in this case ,",
    "@xmath48    similarly to the derivation of ( [ eq4 ] ) , one obtains @xmath49 and similarly to ( [ eq5 ] ) , @xmath50    substitute ( [ eq7])([eq8 ] ) in ( [ eq6 ] ) to get @xmath51 this completes the proof .",
    "@xmath52    of special interest are the _ comparative _ capital increments of the groups .",
    "indeed , it is important to know the capital - related performance of each group against the background of the results achieved by the other one .",
    "the expected one - step capital increment of group  1 as compared with the one of group  2 is expressed as @xmath53 .",
    "theorem  1 enables one to obtain simple formulas for @xmath53 .    in the notation of theorem  @xmath54",
    "if the unanimous rejection group rule is adopted@xmath7 then @xmath55    under the unanimous acceptance group rule@xmath7 one",
    "has @xmath56    the proof of corollary  1 is straightforward .",
    "in order to apply and interpret the results obtained , let us first consider the case where the mean proposed capital increment is zero , i.e. , the environment is neutral ; suppose that the standard deviation of the proposed capital increment is  10 : @xmath57 .",
    "suppose that each group includes 300 participants and group  1 supports a proposal whenever it increases the total capital of the group @xmath58 .",
    "the claim threshold @xmath3 of group  2 varies .    in the case of the unanimous acceptance group rule (",
    "sometimes , we will call it the @xmath59-rule ) , the expected capital increments of the groups and the whole society versus the claim threshold @xmath3 of group  2 , as stated by theorem  1 , are depicted in fig.1 .     @xmath60 . ]",
    "[ fig1 ]    in particular , the average capital increment of group  2 represents a symmetrical bell - shaped curve .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "setting a positive group  2 threshold ( high claims ) leads to the rejection of some favorable to group  2 ( on the average ) proposals , whereas setting a negative threshold ( low claims ) leads to the acceptance , along with the favorable to group  2 proposals , of some proposals unfavorable to it .",
    "so both strategies decrease the expected capital increment of group  2 as against the case of  @xmath61 a  noteworthy fact is that positive and negative thresholds of the same absolute value are equivalent .",
    "let us prove it .",
    "let @xmath62 .",
    "then for fixed values of the model parameters except for  @xmath63 any @xmath64 and under either group voting rule@xmath7 @xmath65 holds .",
    "applying theorem  1 to the case @xmath62 one obtains @xmath66 for the unanimous rejection group rule and @xmath67 for the unanimous acceptance group rule .",
    "the required statement follows from the facts that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are independent of @xmath3 and that @xmath70 is an even function of @xmath3 provided that @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath52    due to ( [ eq11])([eq12 ] ) , for both voting rules under consideration , the expression of @xmath71 in terms of @xmath3 is proportional to the normal density function , which is a bell - shaped curve with zero limits as @xmath72 and @xmath73 finally , if @xmath74 , then under _ both voting rules _ , @xmath75 holds .",
    "@xmath52    next we study the characteristics of social dynamics for each voting rule separately .",
    "if the unanimous acceptance group rule is adopted , then group  1 benefits from low ( negative ) claim threshold @xmath3 of group  2 .",
    "indeed , in this case group  2 rarely vetoes proposals beneficial to group  1 and so group  1 can maximize its benefits .",
    "contrariwise , if @xmath3 is high , then group  1 can rarely expect approval of proposals beneficial to it .",
    "now , suppose that group  2 aims not at maximizing the average capital increment , but at ensuring maximum advantage over group  1 .",
    "in other words , group  2 maximizes @xmath76 rather than @xmath71 .",
    "a  tool group  2 can use for this is its claim threshold  @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , in the example illustrated by fig.1 , @xmath76 as a function of @xmath3 attains its maximum when @xmath53 attains its minimum , i.e. , at @xmath77 in the proposition below , we find the `` claim threshold '' @xmath3 that maximizes @xmath76 in the general case .",
    "suppose the unanimous acceptance group rule is adopted .",
    "then@xmath7 in the notation of theorem  @xmath54 the expected advantage @xmath76 of a  group  @xmath78 member over a  group  @xmath79 member in the sense of capital increment attains its unique maximum at the claim threshold @xmath3 of group  @xmath78 defined by @xmath80    differentiating ( 10 ) with respect to @xmath3 we obtain @xmath81    setting the derivative equal to zero results in the desired expression  ( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "finding the second derivative of the function @xmath82 ensures that a minimum has been found .",
    "hence , ( [ eq13 ] ) provides the unique maximum of @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath52    it should be noted that the optimal claim threshold @xmath83 found in proposition  1 is independent of the group size @xmath84 it is also interesting that expression ( [ eq13 ] ) coincides with ( [ eq4 ] ) in which @xmath85 . in turn ,",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) with @xmath85 expresses the expected capital increment of a member of group  1 provided it exceeds the threshold @xmath2 .",
    "this observation suggests the following simple algorithm of estimating the optimal `` claim threshold '' @xmath83 by group  2 : ( 1 ) find the average capital increments of group  1 members according to the proposals that group  1 supports ; ( 2 )  set the threshold @xmath3 equal to the value found on step  ( 1 ) averaged over the proposals .",
    "thus , to achieve an advantage over group  1 , group  2 should set its claim threshold at a higher level than group  1 does . as has been noted before , the optimal threshold @xmath3 is equal to the mean `` above threshold '' value of group  1 capital increment .",
    "in particular , for the example of fig.1 , ( [ eq13 ] ) gives @xmath86 now , if group  1 wishes to act in the same way ( i.e. , to maximize its advantage @xmath53 with respect to @xmath87 ) , it should , in turn , set a higher threshold : @xmath88 if this process continues , it leads to an infinite increase in the claims ( the process is divergent and the corresponding game possesses no nash equilibrium ) .",
    "@xmath52    how does the maximum comparative gain @xmath76 of group  2 depend on the fixed claim threshold @xmath2 of group  1 ?",
    "it increases as @xmath89 , since in this case group  1 supports all proposals , and thus , the decisions are made by group  2 . if @xmath2 grows , then this maximum gain decreases and tends to zero as @xmath90 since in this case , no proposals are accepted due to the veto of group  1 .",
    "now consider the following question which seems quite interesting . what claim threshold @xmath3 of group  2 is optimal for the whole society ( thus , leading to the maximum expected capital increment of the society ) ?",
    "the answer is provided by the following proposition .",
    "suppose the unanimous acceptance group rule is adopted .",
    "then the expected capital increment of the whole society attains its maximum value at the claim threshold @xmath3 of group  @xmath78 given by @xmath91    theorem  1 ( see ( [ eq2 ] ) ) implies that the expected capital increment of the whole society is @xmath92    the derivative of this function with respect to @xmath3 is @xmath93    setting it equal to zero one obtains @xmath94 , which leads to  ( [ eq14 ] ) . finally , the second derivative test confirms that this point provides a unique maximum value .",
    "@xmath52    [ r_3 ] comparing propositions  1 and  2 produces a somewhat unexpected result .",
    "namely , at @xmath95 those values of claim threshold @xmath3 of group  2 leading to the maximum advantage over group  1 ( on the one hand ) and to the best results for the whole society ( on the other hand ) turn out to be _ opposite .",
    "_ in particular , this is the case for the example illustrated by fig.1 . note that even if @xmath96 , the thresholds @xmath83 and @xmath97 always have different signs ( or both are zero ) , since by ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) , @xmath98    proposition  2 determines @xmath3 ( as a function of @xmath2 ) that guarantees the maximum capital increment of the whole society . let us maximize this maximum over @xmath2 to find the global optimal point of the society . obviously , the corresponding solutions @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfy the system of equations @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 defined in theorem  1 .",
    "most likely , the solution of ( [ eq15 ] ) can not generally be expressed in elementary functions .",
    "in particular , this applies even to the simplest case of @xmath95 ( two groups of equal size ) in which the system ( [ eq15 ] ) reduces to @xmath102    nevertheless , the solution can be obtained numerically .",
    "for instance , the dependence on @xmath16 of the claim threshold @xmath103 optimal for the society is shown ( in the case of @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) in fig.2 .     and the claim threshold @xmath106 that maximizes the capital increment of the whole society provided that @xmath107 and @xmath105 . ]    [ fig2 ]    in particular , for @xmath108 and @xmath109 the optimal threshold is @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the unique solution of the equation @xmath112 with @xmath113 and @xmath114 designating the density and distribution function of the standard normal distribution .",
    "one of the most instructive results of this study is that under the unanimous acceptance group rule , the claim threshold @xmath115 of the groups that is optimal for the whole society is negative ( see fig.2 ) . in the case",
    "@xmath95 , it tends to zero from below as @xmath116 and asymptotically approaches to the line @xmath117 as @xmath118 .",
    "negative claim thresholds of the groups can be interpreted as a willingness to a moderately negative result , that is , as a certain appetite for risk .",
    "now consider the unanimous rejection group rule ( we will also call it the @xmath119-rule ) . with this procedure , for acceptance of a proposal , the support of either one group is sufficient .",
    "the analytical results obtained in section  2 are illustrated by the diagram in fig.3 .",
    "@xmath107 . ]",
    "[ fig3 ]    it can be easily observed that this diagram mirrors the one shown in fig.1 .",
    "indeed , the following statement holds .",
    "let @xmath62 .",
    "if the model parameters@xmath7 except for @xmath63 are fixed@xmath7 then for any @xmath64 @xmath120 holds@xmath7 where @xmath121 @xmath122 is the expectation@xmath7 provided the unanimous acceptance group rule @xmath123resp.@xmath7 the unanimous rejection group rule@xmath124 is adopted .",
    "moreover@xmath7 at @xmath74 one has @xmath125 for any @xmath126    according to theorem  1 , for @xmath62 we have : @xmath127    moreover , @xmath74 implies that @xmath128 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "@xmath52    due to corollary  2 , @xmath62 implies that @xmath129 for either voting rule under study .",
    "consequently , if @xmath62 and @xmath130 then every relationship under @xmath119-rule can be derived from the corresponding relationship obtained for the @xmath59-rule by means of the @xmath131-axis reflection .",
    "thus , in this case , the situations where voting is organized according to the @xmath59-rule and according to the @xmath119-rule are , in a certain sense , dual .",
    "@xmath52    note that under the @xmath119-rule , group  1 benefits from excessive claims of group  2 ( i.e. , from high threshold  @xmath3 ) . in this case , if threshold @xmath2 is positive , but not so high , then most decisions are made for the benefit of group  1 . on the other hand , at a low threshold @xmath63",
    "group  2 ensures implementation of almost all proposals , and so most proposals unfavorable to group  1 pass through the `` riddle '' of voting .",
    "now let us consider the maximization problem for the group  2 advantage @xmath76 over group  1 provided that the @xmath119-rule is adopted .    under the @xmath119-rule@xmath7 the expected advantage @xmath76 of a group  @xmath78 member over a group",
