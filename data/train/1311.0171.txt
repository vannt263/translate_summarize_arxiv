    "similar distributions of the ib@xmath0 and is@xmath0 are found , which also reveals that @xmath0 depends on the neutron density ( @xmath12 ) and the proton density ( @xmath13 ) distributions , as well as the asymmetry of projectile .    in comparison with the fragments produced by intermediate projectile fragmentation in ref .",

    "generally , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the resultant @xmath1 should vary very little , and there should be no nuclear structure effects in the colliding process near the critical point temperature @xcite . in actual reactions ,",
