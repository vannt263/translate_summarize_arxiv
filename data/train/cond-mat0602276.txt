    "in the last years several networks were analyzed , like internet routers , biological and metabolic networks , or sexual contacts @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the node degree distributions of all of them seem to follow a power law .",
    "also , several models of graph growth were presented in order to explain the emergence of this power law distribution @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , several critics appeared , mainly focusing on sampling bias @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the quality of data fitting @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , a simple experiment was presented in @xcite studying the linear fit on the log log scale of computationally generated data with a pure power law distribution , and a severe bias error was reported ( @xmath0 , and @xmath1 with logarithmic bins ) .    in this work we present an underlying problem which explains those errors : regrettably , the matrix in the least square method is ill conditioned .",
    "let @xmath2 be the maximum degree of the network , we show that the condition number grows at least as the logarithm of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , we introduce a parameter @xmath3 $ ] and we consider only the node degree distribution on @xmath4 $ ] ( in fact , this is a usual procedure , see @xcite ) .",
    "numerical computations show that the situation is worse when we focus on the tail of the distribution .",
    "our results complement the ones in @xcite , where biological networks were considered and a different statistical problem arose , since on that work the power law fit was performed with the maximum likelihood method .    also , we compute the matrix condition for scale free graphs generated with the linear preferential attachment model introduced by barabasi and albert @xcite . we show that the matrix condition grows when the network size increases .",
    "for a given matrix @xmath5 , and a matrix norm @xmath6 , the condition number is defined as @xmath7 usually , for the @xmath8-norm the condition is denoted @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath8-norm is an operator type norm , i.e. for @xmath10 , taking the vectorial euclidean norm @xmath11 we have @xmath12    concerning the condition number , the following results are well known @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the minimum and the maximum eigenvalue ( in absolute value ) , and @xmath16 which says that @xmath17 is the reciprocal of the relative distance of @xmath18 to the set of singular matrices .",
    "the interest in the condition number for matrices is related to the accuracy of computations , since it gives a bound for the propagation of the relative error in the data when a linear system is solved . if @xmath19 , then @xmath20 is roughly the number of significant figures we can expect to lose in computations .",
    "more precisely , for a general system @xmath21 , if we consider a perturbation on the right hand side @xmath22 , then calling @xmath23 to the exact solution of @xmath24 it can be shown that @xmath25    a practical rule in statistics is to avoid the least square method when the condition number is greater than or equal to @xmath26 ( indeed they define @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a strong sign of collinearity , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a graph @xmath29 with @xmath20 nodes @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the degree of node @xmath32 , that is , the number of links emanating from @xmath32 . let us define @xmath33 for each @xmath34 , @xmath35 , let @xmath36 be the number of nodes with degree @xmath34 .",
    "the existence of a power law dependence @xmath37 is usually observed in a log - log plot , and computed with the least square method after a logarithmic change of variables .",
    "first we assume that the degrees span the full integer interval @xmath38 $ ] . in this case",
    "the matrix @xmath39 corresponding to the least square fit , regardless of the measured data , is given by @xmath40 in certain a sense , this correspond to the best situation where the data span the full range of variables .",
    "the following result estimates the condition number of @xmath39 , when @xmath41 :    [ th : uno ] for @xmath2 large , it holds @xmath42    : we use here ( [ condi ] ) .",
    "a straightforward computation of the eigenvalues of @xmath39 gives @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45    for @xmath2 large we can write @xmath46 and @xmath47 replacing this expressions in ( [ maximo ] ) and ( [ minimo ] ) , we get by taking limit @xmath48    since in practice logarithmic bin is preferred ( see for example @xcite ) , due to the sparsity of measurements at the tail of the distribution , our next result shows that also the corresponding matrix is ill conditioned .",
    "we suppose that the selected degrees for the computation are of the form @xmath49 with @xmath35 .",
    "calling @xmath50 the corresponding least square matrix , we can write    @xmath51    and the following holds    [ th : dos ] for @xmath2 large @xmath52    : using again ( [ condi ] ) , and computing explicitly the eigenvalues of @xmath50 , we have    @xmath53    hence , for @xmath2 large @xmath54    numerical experiments in the next section suggest that considering a logarithmic bin of the form @xmath55 is unnecessary , since the condition number grows almost independently of @xmath56 , see table [ tab:1 ] .      in this section we present several numerical computations of matrix conditions .",
    "we computed the condition number of matrix @xmath39 numerically by using matlab . also , we computed the condition number for the truncated matrix @xmath57 , for each @xmath2 we consider the matrix obtained with degree values between @xmath58 and @xmath2 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : conda ] for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "with @xmath62    we show the dependence on @xmath63 in figure [ fig : asubc3 ] , for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with @xmath63 from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .     with @xmath68    in table [ tab:1 ]",
    "we show the condition numbers for logarithmic bins of the form @xmath69 , @xmath35 , for @xmath70 and @xmath71 ; and @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "this is a model of network growth , where a new node is added with a link to a previously added node , chosen at random with a probability proportional to its degree .",
    "we generated @xmath87 graphs of @xmath88 nodes , @xmath89 graphs of @xmath90 nodes , @xmath88 graphs of @xmath91 nodes , and @xmath88 graphs of @xmath92 nodes , and computed the condition of the least square matrix associated with each one .",

    "we have studied the condition number of the least square matrix corresponding to scale free networks .",
    "we computed theoretical lower bounds of the condition numbers showing that it behaves roughly as the logarithm of the maximum degree of the network , and numerical simulations support this fact .",
    "we also showed that neglecting the less connected nodes of the network ( a usual practice in fact , since the interest is on the tail ) things become even worse .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for the logarithmic bin .",
