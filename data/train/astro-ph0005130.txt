    "in the paradigm for the power source of an agn , the continuum luminosity and spectral temperature are related to the mass by the relation    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the average photon energy , @xmath3 cm is the radius , and @xmath4 is the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the temperature in the part of the disk is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the   in units of the   ( @xmath8 being the efficiency ) , so that @xmath9 at the limit .",
    "when the   approaches the rate , the thin disk solution in the inner region is probably not valid , and it has to be replaced by a hot disk solution ( e.g. wandel & liang 1991 ) .",
    "the spectrum of a multi - is given by integrating the local spectrum over the entire disk , @xmath10 dr $ ] , where @xmath11 is the planck function and @xmath12 is the transition radius from the region to the inner optically thin region . if the disk is radially extended ( @xmath13 ) , the spectrum is almost flat ( @xmath14 ) and cuts off beyond @xmath15 , approximately @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the normalization and cutoff frequency . for a kerr black hole , malkan ( 1990 )",
    "finds @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "this can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath4 is the _ observed _ luminosity , and we have included a bolometric correction of 10 . if the region extends down to a radius @xmath12 , and the euv cutoff energy is @xmath22 , then @xmath23 when the regime extends close to the inner disk edge , the spectrum for the case peaks at the photon energy @xmath24 . for a kerr ( eq .",
    "[ equ : eco ] ) @xmath25 . plotting the cutoff frequency versus the luminosity",
    ", one can infer the mass .",
    "alternatively , if the mass can be estimated independently , it is possible to estimate the cutoff frequency ( fig .  1 ;",
    "wandel & petrosian 1988 ) .",
    "it is possible to estimate the mass from the broad emission - line profile , assuming the velocity width is induced by a keplerian velocity dispersion .",
    "when the broad line region size is estimated by reverberation mapping , this technique is particularly reliable .",
    "wandel , peterson & malkan ( 1999 ) have used a sample of agn with reverberation data to calibrate the mass estimate obtained from photoionization models , finding the relation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the ionization parameter , @xmath28 is the density in units of 10@xmath29  , and @xmath30 is the h@xmath31 fwhm in units of @xmath32  . using this calibrated relation , it is possible to estimate masses for large samples , even without reverberation data ( wandel , malkan & peterson , in preparation ) . combining equations [ equ : mph ] and [ equ : eco ] , we have    @xmath33    which is independent of luminosity and only weakly dependent on the unknown parameters @xmath27 and @xmath34 . using eq .",
    "[ equ : ecov ] with @xmath35=1 , we find the mass and cutoff energy distribution for a large sample of quasars , seyfert 1 galaxies and nls1s ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "note that @xmath22 is anticorrelated with the mass , and in particular that different agn categories group in different regions of the @xmath36-@xmath22 plane : quasars have more massive and low cutoff energies , seyfert  1 galaxies have intermediate masses ( @xmath37@xmath38 ) , and nls1s have low masses ( @xmath39@xmath40 ) and high cutoff energies .",
    "this is consistent with the large soft x - ray excesses observed for many of the nls1s .",
    "the diagonal dotted lines in fig",
    ".  1 give the @xmath41 ratio .",
    "it appears that quasars tend to be in the 0.011 range , seyferts in the 0.0010.1 range , and nls1s are all near with @xmath42  0.11 .",
    "compact dark masses , probably massive ( mbhs ) , have been detected in the cores of many normal galaxies using stellar dynamics ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) . the mbh mass appears to correlate with the galactic bulge luminosity , with the mbh having about one percent of the mass of the spheroidal bulge ( magorrian 1998 , richstone 1998 ) .",
    "wandel & mushotzky ( 1986 ) have found an excellent correlation between the virial mass included within the narrow line region ( of order tens to hundreds of pc from the center ) and the  mass estimated from x - ray variability in a sample of seyfert 1 galaxies , while a group of seyfert  2 galaxies systematically deviated from this relation .",
    "a -bulge relation similar to that of normal galaxies has been reported between the mbh of bright pg quasars and their host galaxies ( laor 1998 ) , but the mass of the elliptical host ( or bulge , for spiral hosts ) estimates have large uncertainties .",
    "a significantly lower to bulge mass ratio has been found for the 17 seyfert  1 galaxies with reverberation data ( wandel 1999 ) .",
    "while the average is lower than the magorrian relation by a factor of 20 , the record belongs to the nls1 galaxy ngc  4051 , for which wandel ( 1999 ) finds a ratio that is a factor of 200 lower than the magorrian relation .",
    "apparently , this result suggests an intrinsic difference between the central of seyfert galaxies and those of normal galaxies .",
    "actually the difference may be ( at least partly ) due to a selection effect .",
    "in angular - resolution limited methods ( which are applied for detecting mbhs in normal galaxies ) , the mbh detection limit is correlated with bulge luminosity : more luminous bulges have a higher detection limit because the stellar velocity dispersion is higher ( the faber - jackson relation ) . in order to detect the dynamic effect of a mbh ,",
    "it is necessary to observe closer to the center , while the most luminous galaxies tend to be at larger distances .",
    "so , for a given angular resolution , the mbh detection limit is higher .",
    "another effect could bias the pg quasars .",
    "being the brightest nearby quasars , they may represent a subset of massive ( and well - fed ) .",
    "smaller ones would not appear as bright and would not be included in the quasar host galaxy survey .",
    "the blr method is not subject to this constraint , making seyfert 1 galaxies good candidates for detecting low - mass mbhs .",
    "seyfert  1 galaxies also have more reliable bulge mass estimates ; as they are nearer and have a lower nuclear brightness , their host type and bulge magnitudes can be estimated more easily ( whittle 1992 ) .    finally , we concentrate on the difference between seyfert 1 galaxies and nls1s .",
    "ngc 4051 , the only nls1 in the sample of 17 seyfert  1 galaxies with reverberation data , shows a dramatically lower to bulge mass ratio and higher @xmath0 ratio ( wandel 1999 ) .",
    "reverberation data on more nls1s are required before one can conclude that nls1s have intrinsically lower to bulge mass ratios and smaller black holes .",
