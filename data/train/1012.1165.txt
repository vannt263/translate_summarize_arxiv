    "the recent measurements of the vector charmonium radiative decays to light pseudoscalars , i.e. @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , have brought surprises and interests to us .",
    "earlier , the cleo collaboration  @xcite renewed the branching ratios for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , which are consistent with the averages from 2008 particle data group  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio upper limits for @xmath20 and @xmath17 were set , which were more than one order of magnitude smaller than that for @xmath19 .",
    "meanwhile , the upper limits for @xmath21 , where @xmath4 stands for pseudoscalar @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , were set to be about @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath1 radiative decays are also investigated by the besiii collaboration with the newly collected 106 million @xmath1 events , and the results turn out to be tantalizing .",
    "it shows that the branching ratios for @xmath23 and @xmath17 are only at an order of @xmath24 , which are nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the mysterious aspects somehow are correlated with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data .",
    "it is found that the branching ratio for @xmath25 is much smaller than those for @xmath26 and @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "this could be a consequence of suppressions of gluon couplings to isovector currents . as a comparison",
    ", the observation in @xmath10 is indeed puzzling .",
    "the immediate question is , what drives the difference of decay patterns between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in the literature",
    ", the radiative decays of the vector charmonia attracted a lot of theoretical efforts .",
    "an early study by the qcd sum rules  @xcite suggested the dominance of short - distance @xmath27 annihilations .",
    "the gluon and @xmath28 transition matrix elements were computed by coupling the gluon fields to the pseudoscalar states with which the branching ratio fraction @xmath29 was satisfactorily described . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath8 mixings with the light pseudoscalars @xmath6 and @xmath7 were extracted through the axial gluonic anomaly on the basis of chiral and large @xmath30 approach . by assuming that the partial widths of @xmath31 and @xmath15 were saturated by the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing",
    ", the branching ratios for @xmath31 and @xmath15 were accounted for to the correct orders of magnitude .",
    "this issue was revisited by feldmann _",
    "et al . _ who proposed to extract the mixing and decay constants on the quark flavor basis  @xcite .",
    "this scheme can be easily extended to accommodate the mixing of @xmath8 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 from which the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing angles were extracted and turned out to be consistent with those from refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the new data from besiii for @xmath32 seem to suggest a deviation from the saturation assumption .",
    "it implies that some other mechanisms become important in @xmath10 , although they may not play a significant role in @xmath33 . in this work",
    ", we shall show that the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model is an ideal framework to make a coherent analysis of the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing effects and contributions from intermediate vector mesons .",
    "we shall show that the @xmath10 is not saturated by the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing . instead , one important mechanism that drives the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath10 and produces the observed patterns is the sizeable coupling of @xmath34 .",
    "as follows , we first give a brief introduction to the vmd model and lay out the correlated aspects of the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixings in sec .",
    "ii . the detailed analysis , calculation results and discussions",
    "will then be presented in sec .",
    "a brief summary will be given in sec .",
    "in the vmd model ( e.g. see review of refs .",
    "@xcite ) the electromagnetic ( em ) current can be decomposed into a sum of all neutral vector meson fields including both isospin-0 and isospin-1 components .",
    "the leading @xmath35 effective coupling can be written as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the vector meson field .",
    "the photon - vector - meson coupling constant @xmath38 can be extracted from the partial decay width @xmath39 . neglecting the mass of electron and positron",
    ", we have @xmath40^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\label{fv}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the electron three - vector momentum in the vector meson rest frame , and @xmath42 is the em fine - structure constant .    for the decays of @xmath43 , the vmd contributing diagrams are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "this classification is based on the photon producing mechanisms and related to the experimental measurements .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) identifies such a process that the photon is connected to a hadronic vector meson fields .",
    "it requires a sum over all strong transitions of @xmath44 channels .    the second process in fig .  [ fig-1](b ) is via charmonium electromagnetic ( em ) annihilations .",
    "such a process generally has small contributions in comparison with the strong transitions .",
    "however , it is likely that the em amplitudes may have significant effects in some exclusive decay channels . in recent series studies",
    "@xcite it shows that in the hadronic decays of @xmath45 , the short ( via three gluon annihilation ) and long - distance ( fig .  [ fig-1](c ) ) transition amplitudes may have a destructive interfering mode that would efficiently reduce the strong transition amplitudes in some exclusive channels . as a consequence , the em amplitudes may become compatible with the strong ones , and manifest themselves in experimental observables .",
    "this issue is related to the so - called  @xmath46 puzzle \" , which questions",
    "why the branching ratio fraction @xmath47 is so strongly suppressed in comparison with the pqcd expectation values  @xcite .",
    "a review of this subject and some recent progresses on this problem can be found in the literature  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "our attention is to understand whether the data for @xmath48 are consistent with those for @xmath44 , and what drives the different radiative decay patterns between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we shall adopt the available experimental measurements of @xmath44 in the calculations of the vmd contributions .",
    "this means we need not worry about the detailed transition mechanisms for @xmath49 at this moment . also , by adopting the experimental data for @xmath44 , we need not consider the @xmath50 mixing processes since they have been contained in the data for @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth noting in advance another feature with this classification of fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "namely , transitions between vector charmonia may also contribute .",
    "for instance , @xmath51 will contribute to @xmath52 .",
    "we will show later that this process is essential for understanding the radiative decay patterns for @xmath0 and @xmath10 .    apart from the transitions via fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , another important transition is via fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] which corresponds to the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing due to the axial vector anomaly .",
    "note that the process of fig .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) with an intermediate charmonium does not overlap with fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] at the hadronic level .",
    "in fact , it is interesting to note their correlated features : i ) in both cases , the @xmath27 annihilate at short distances . in fig .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) , the vector configuration of @xmath27 annihilates into a photon , i.e. @xmath27 in a relative @xmath53-wave with spin-1 , while in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] the pseudoscalar @xmath27 are in a relative @xmath53-wave but with spin-0 , and then annihilates into gluons .",
    "ii ) the process of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] is through a typical magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transition of @xmath54 , which can be regarded as a non - vector - resonance contribution in respect to the vmd scenario .     in the frame of vmd . ]     and @xmath15 via @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing . ]    with the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lag-1 ] ) , the transition amplitude can be expressed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the coupling constants for the hadronic vertex of @xmath44 , and will be determined by experimental data via @xmath57 we adopt an empirical form for the form factor  @xcite : @xmath58 where parameter @xmath59 is in a range of @xmath60 mev .",
    "this form factor can be interpreted as the wavefunction overlap which would be suppressed in a large recoil momentum region for the final state particles  @xcite .",
    "the incovariant form factor can also be regarded reasonable in this case .",
    "the decay processes are treated in the c.m .",
    "frame of the initial meson .",
    "therefore , the anti - symmetric tensor structure of the interactions can always be reduced to a form of @xmath61 , which explicitly depends on the three - vector momentum of the final state vector meson .",
    "note that for the anti - symmetric tensor couplings all the contributions to the transition amplitude can be absorbed into the effective coupling form factor . because of this , it is natural to expect that the form factor would contain information of meson wavefunction overlaps with an explicit three - vector - momentum dependence . in particular ,",
    "a harmonic oscillator potential for the quark - antiquark system will lead to a form factor similar to eq .",
    "( [ ff-01 ] ) .",
    "we shall determine the form factor parameter @xmath59 combining the data for @xmath62 and @xmath3 .",
    "it will then be fixed and adopted for the calculations of other channels . in the transition of fig .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) , the vector meson will carry the momentum of the final state photon @xmath63 .",
    "the transition amplitudes of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] can be expressed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mixing angle between pseudoscalar @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "it has been extracted in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are also obtained by ref .",
    "it should be noted that in the above equation the coupling @xmath68 is extracted from the data for @xmath69 .",
    "the non - local effects from the off - shell @xmath8 at the mass of @xmath9 have been included in the mixing angles  @xcite . in the second line , we define a reduced coupling @xmath70 , which can be directly compared with the effective coupling @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ trans-1 ] ) .",
    "we do not include the @xmath72 mixings with the @xmath9 in @xmath73 and @xmath15 since their mixing angles are relatively small .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath72 mixing effects will be further suppressed by the unknown but believe - to - be - small branching ratio for @xmath74 .",
    "in table  [ tab-1 ] , the data for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath75 from pdg 2010  @xcite are listed .",
    "it shows that most of the light @xmath76 channels have been measured for @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadronic decays .",
    "in contrast , most of the light @xmath76 channels for @xmath77 are below the experimental precision limit except for @xmath78 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the @xmath62 channels are correlated with the so - called  @xmath46 puzzle \" in the literature .",
    "however , our attention in the present work is different . we shall use the experimental data for @xmath44 as an input to investigate the role played by the vmd mechanisms in the vector charmonium radiative decays",
    "this treatment means that one need not be concerned about the detailed transition mechanisms for @xmath44 at this moment since they all have been contained in the experimental data .",
    "we emphasize that this should not be a trivial starting point .",
    "success of such a prescription would help us clarify two major processes in the charmonium radiative decays , i.e. the relative @xmath53-wave @xmath27 annihilations would occur either via spin-1 or spin-0 configurations .",
    ".branching ratios for @xmath79 from pdg 2010  @xcite .",
    "the dash  - \" and dots  @xmath80 \" denote the forbidden and unavailable channels , respectively . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our investigation suggests the importance of a coherent treatment for the vmd mechanism and @xmath8-@xmath9 mixings .",
    "note that the charmonium pole contribution has not been included by the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , an understanding of why the vmd and axial gluonic anomaly mechanisms play different roles in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays would be essentially important .",
    "the following points may help to clarify this question :    \\i ) as mentioned earlier , there are some interesting correspondences between the axial gluonic anomaly and vmd in this case . in the axial gluonic anomaly transitions the @xmath27 annihilate into gluon fields at short distances in a relative @xmath53-wave and spin-0 , which induces mixings with the goldstone boson @xmath6 and su(3 ) flavor singlet @xmath7 .",
    "the photon radiation can be regarded as from non - vector - resonance m1 transitions . in the vmd transitions via the charmonium state , the @xmath27 also annihilate at short distances in a relative @xmath53-wave , but with spin-1 . in this case , the annihilated @xmath27 couple to a photon , and radiate two soft gluons which can couple to pseudoscalar states .",
    "\\ii ) the difference between those two mechanisms can be well - understood quantum mechanically . for @xmath81 , the vmd transitions via @xmath1 pole",
    "is relative suppressed by the @xmath82 coupling since as the first radial excited state the wavefunction of @xmath1 at the origin is smaller than that of @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the axial - gluonic - anomaly - driving @xmath8-@xmath9 mixings will occur via @xmath83 , where the first step is a typical em m1 transition between two ground charmonium states .",
    "it is allowed by the quantum transition selection rule at leading order .",
    "the situation changes in @xmath84 . on the one hand ,",
    "the vmd transition will be dominated by the @xmath0 pole , which will be coupled to the em field . on the other hand ,",
    "the axial gluonic anomaly transitions via the @xmath1-@xmath8 m1 transition will be suppressed by the quantum transition selection rule at leading order . for the @xmath72-mediated transition , the @xmath72 mixings with the @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "will then be suppressed  @xcite .",
    "the above qualitative argument explains why the vmd mechanism and axial gluonic anomaly play different roles in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , respectively , as manifested by the calculation .",
    "in particular , it shows that both mechanisms are crucial for our understanding of the observed branching ratio patterns .",
    "the successful account of the observed branching ratio patterns for @xmath11 in the vmd model has an important implication of the hadronic decay mechanisms for @xmath62 .",
    "it shows that the  puzzling \" radiative decay patterns in @xmath11 have direct connections with the hadronic decay mechanisms , i.e. @xmath62 , instead of some other abnormal processes . as a consequence",
    ", it will guide our further investigations of the transitions of @xmath62 , and impose constraints on processes such as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "for instance , the hadronic part of fig .",
    "[ fig-1](c ) is found to be an important non - perturbative qcd mechanism that contributes predominantly in @xmath51 and @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out recently in a series of papers on the subject of non - perturbative transition mechanisms in charmonium decays  @xcite , such intermediate meson loop transitions would be an natural mechanism for evading the pqcd helicity selection rule and explaining the  @xmath46 puzzle \" in @xmath62 .",
    "in brief , with the available data for @xmath62 , we show that the vmd model is still useful for our understanding of the newly measured branching ratios for @xmath86 in association with the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixings via the axial gluonic anomaly .",
    "importance of such a contribution has not been recognized before . in particular",
    ", we stress that the intermediate vector charmonia can have significant contributions via e.g. @xmath87 .",
    "we show that these two mechanisms behave differently in @xmath0 and @xmath10 , and can be understood by state transition selection rules .",
    "we also emphasize that the consistency between @xmath11 and @xmath76 demonstrated in this work would impose important constraints on the non - pqcd mechanisms in @xmath62 .",
    "it would be useful for our final understanding of the long - standing  @xmath46 puzzle \" in @xmath62 .",
