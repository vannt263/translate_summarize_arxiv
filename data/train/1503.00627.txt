    "it has been known for a long time that there is a striking similarity between black hole physics and thermodynamics @xcite , which suggests a deep connection between gravity and thermodynamics .",
    "this led to several attempts to understand einstein s equations as effective equations emerging from the thermodynamics of underlying degrees of freedom , such as @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "ads / cft correspondence @xcite provides a broad framework allowing the description of gravitational theories with ads asymptotics in @xmath4 dimensions as emergent from strongly coupled conformal field theories in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "a fair question in the ads / cft framework is whether the similarities between gravity and thermodynamics can be explained by considering einstein s equations as thermodynamic relations for the conformal field theory degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has also been suggested that the connection between gravity and thermodynamics should not be attributed to thermal statistics , but rather to quantum statistics related to quantum entanglement physics @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it has been conjectured that the entanglement entropy , which is a measure of entanglement between subsystems of a composite quantum system and it is defined for a given entangling surface that separates the degrees of freedom of the corresponding conformal field theory into two subsystems , is directly connected to the area of an open extremal hypersurface in the emergent asymptotically ads geometry whose boundary is the entangling surface .",
    "this conjecture , which is named after ryu - takayanagi @xcite , provides a quantitative tool to understand how gravitational dynamics emerges from thermodynamics related to entanglement in the boundary conformal field theory .",
    "so far , this programme has been advanced by comparing the variation of entanglement entropy to the variation of the expectation value of the so called modular hamiltonian for any given entangling surface @xcite .",
    "the latter can be expressed in terms of the holographic energy - momentum tensor when spherical entangling surfaces are taken in poincar  coordinates @xcite , while the former is provided by the ryu - takayanagi formula @xcite .",
    "enforcing the first law of thermodynamics for entanglement through holography , imposes constraints for the metric perturbations around ads space , which to linear order turn out to be einstein s equations satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is also known that all solutions of the linearized einstein s equations with dirichlet boundary conditions satisfy the first law of thermodynamics .    in this paper , we work out the holographic realization of the first law of thermodynamics for small perturbations of spherical @xmath2 space - time having axial symmetry and satisfying general boundary conditions . the general framework for field equations satisfying general boundary conditions in @xmath2",
    "is provided in reference @xcite .",
    "the entangling surfaces are now curves , since the boundary conformal field theory is @xmath6 dimensional , and they are taken to be circular , bounding a polar cap region , so that they respect the axial symmetry of the bulk geometry .",
    "our general result is that the first law of thermodynamics for entanglement is realized holographically in all cases , hereby extending previous works beyond dirichlet boundary conditions , provided that the line element of the entangling curve is inert to the perturbations .    in this context",
    ", we also examine the role of gravitational electric - magnetic duality to entanglement physics .",
    "it is well known that small perturbations of maximally symmetric spaces exhibit a rank-2 generalization of electric - magnetic duality , interchanging the linearized einstein equations with the bianchi identities in four space - time dimensions .",
    "this symmetry was originally discussed for gravitons in minkowski space @xcite , but it was subsequently generalized in the presence of cosmological constant by considering metric perturbations of @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath2 space - time @xcite .",
    "there , it was also found that electric - magnetic duality in @xmath2 has a holographic manifestation as energy - momentum / cotton tensor duality .",
    "these considerations provide the gravitational analogue of the holographic interpretation of electric - magnetic duality in theories with @xmath8 gauge symmetry @xcite , but their physics in the space of boundary three - dimensional conformal theories still remain largely unexplored .",
    "duality acts on metric perturbations by interchanging their boundary conditions .",
    "hence , our interest in the holographic description of gravitational perturbations satisfying general boundary conditions in the spirit of reference @xcite . extending the applications of gravitational duality to entanglement entropy and related issues may shed new light into this interesting subject .",
    "the material of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present a review of the notions of entanglement entropy and modular hamiltonian , together with their holographic description , and include various formulae that will be used in the computations . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the general theory of gravitational perturbations of @xmath2 space - time and formulate the linearized einstein equations as an effective schrdinger problem , splitting the perturbations into two distinct classes with opposite parity . the presentation is made general , encompassing arbitrary boundary conditions . in section 4 , we compute holographically the variations of the entanglement entropy and the modular hamiltonian and compare the two expressions for general boundary conditions .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics for entanglement is verified in all cases , while describing the subtleties that go into the computation . in section 5",
    ", we address the role of electric - magnetic duality in holography and study its implications for the first law of thermodynamics for entanglement .",
    "finally , section 6 , contains our conclusions and a short discussion of open problems .",
    "there are also three appendices containing various technical details and formulae that are used in the main text .",
    "we present a brief account of the notions of entanglement entropy and modular hamiltonian together with their holographic description in terms of bulk space geometry .",
    "we also derive some general formulae that will be used later for gravitational perturbations of @xmath2 space - time satisfying general boundary conditions .      consider a composite quantum system comprising of several subsystems .",
    "even if the composite system lies in a pure state , with density matrix @xmath9 , this may not be true for its subsystems , which are hereby described by a density matrix equal to the partial trace of @xmath9 over the degrees of freedom of the complementary subsystem , @xmath10 when the complementary subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not entangled , the reduced density matrix @xmath13 also describes a pure state .",
    "entanglement between systems @xmath11 and @xmath12 is encoded to the spectrum of the reduced density matrix @xmath13 under the implicit assumption that the composite system lies in a pure state .",
    "the entanglement entropy is defined as the von neumann entropy associated to the reduced density matrix @xmath13 , @xmath14    the density matrix @xmath13 is hermitian and positive semi - definite , leading to the definition of the corresponding modular hamiltonian as @xmath15 then , the entanglement entropy can be rewritten in terms of the modular hamiltonian as @xmath16    small variations in the pure state of the overall system or the region @xmath11 generate variations of the density matrix , @xmath17 , and , thus , the entanglement entropy will also be perturbed .",
