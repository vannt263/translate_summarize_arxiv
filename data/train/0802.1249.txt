    "one of the most important sources of gravitational radiation for the laser interferometric detectors ligo , virgo @xcite and lisa @xcite is the inspiralling and merging compact binary system . until the late inspiral , prior to merger , the gravitational waves are accurately described by the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation to general relativity @xcite , while the late inspiral and subsequent merger and ringdown phases are computed by a full - fledged numerical integration of the einstein field equations @xcite .",
    "a new field has emerged recently consisting of high - accuracy comparisons between the pn predictions and the numerically - generated waveforms .",
    "such comparisons and matching to the pn results have proved currently to be very successful @xcite .",
    "they clearly show the need to include high pn corrections not only for the evolution of the binary s orbital phase but also for the modulation of the gravitational amplitude .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compute the full gravitational waveform generated by inspiralling compact binaries moving in quasi - circular orbits at the third post - newtonian ( 3pn ) orderpn as the order equivalent to terms @xmath0 in the asymptotic waveform ( beyond the einstein quadrupole formula ) , where @xmath1 denotes the binary s orbital velocity and @xmath2 is the speed of light . ] . by the full waveform ( fwf ) at a certain pn order , we mean the waveform including all higher - order amplitude corrections and hence all higher - order harmonics of the orbital frequency consistent with that pn order .",
    "the fwf is to be contrasted with the so - called restricted waveform ( rwf ) which retains only the leading - order harmonic at twice the orbital frequency . in applications to data analysis both the fwf and rwf should incorporate the orbital phase evolution up to the maximum available post - newtonian order which is currently 3.5pn @xcite .",
    "previous investigations@xcite have obtained the fwf up to 2.5pn order .",
    "recently kidder @xcite pointed out that there is already enough information in the existing pn results @xcite to control the _",
    "dominant _ mode of the waveform , in a spin - weighted spherical harmonic decomposition , at the 3pn order .",
    "this mode , having @xmath3 , is the one which is computed in most numerical simulations , and which is therefore primarily needed for comparison with the pn waveforms . in the present paper we shall extend the works @xcite by computing all the spin - weighted spherical harmonic modes @xmath4 consistent with the 3pn gravitational polarisations .",
    "the data analysis of ground - based and space - based detectors has traditionally been based on the rwf approximation @xcite . however , the need to consider the fwf as a more powerful template has been emphasized , not only for performing a more accurate parameter estimation @xcite , but also for improving the mass reach and the detection rate @xcite .",
    "another motivation for considering the fwf instead of the rwf is to perform cosmological measurements of the hubble parameter and dark energy using supermassive inspiralling black - hole binaries which are known to constitute standard gravitational - wave candles ( or sirens ) in cosmology @xcite .",
    "indeed it has been shown that using the fwf in the data analysis of lisa will yield substantial improvements ( with respect to the rwf ) of the angular resolution and the estimation of the luminosity distance of gravitational - wave sirens @xcite .",
    "this means that lisa may be able to uniquely identify the galaxy cluster in which the supermassive black - hole coalescence took place , and thereby permit the measurement of the red - shift of the source which is crucially needed for investigating the equation of state of dark energy @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in order to control the fwf at the 3pn order we need to further develop the multipolar post - minkowskian ( mpm ) wave generation formalism @xcite .",
    "the mpm formalism describes the radiation field of any isolated post - newtonian source and constitutes the basis of current pn calculations . in this formalism , the radiation field is first of all parametrized by means of two sets of radiative multipole moments @xcite .",
    "these moments are then related ( by means of an algorithm for solving the non - linearities of the field equations ) to the so - called canonical moments which constitute some useful intermediaries for describing the external field of the source .",
    "finally , the canonical moments are expressed in terms of the operational source moments which are given by explicit integrals extending over the matter source and gravitational field . in previous studies @xcite",
    "most of the required source moments in the case of compact binaries were computed , or techniques were developed to compute them .",
    "the important step which remains here is to refine , by applying the mpm framework , the relationships between the radiative and canonical moments  this means taking into account more non - linear interactions between multipole moments  and between the canonical and source moments .",
    "the latter relationship involves controlling the coordinate transformation between two mpm algorithms respectively defined from the sets of canonical and source moments .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ secii ]",
    "we recall the basic formulas for defining the fwf in terms of radiative multipole moments .",
    "sections [ seciii ] and [ seciv ] apply the mpm formalism to obtain general formulas for relating the radiative moments to the source moments _ via _ the canonical moments .",
    "section [ secv ] summarises the results for all the relevant moments parametrizing the fwf at 3pn order .",
    "the time derivatives of source moments are investigated in section [ secvi ] and the various hereditary contributions are computed in section [ secvii ] .",
    "the complete polarization waveforms at 3pn order are given in section [ secviii ] for data analysis applications .",
    "finally , the spin - weighted spherical harmonic modes of the 3pn waveform are provided in section [ secix ] for use in numerical relativity .    for the benefits of readers we provide in appendix [ appa ] a list of symbols used in the paper together with their main meaning .",
    "the full waveform ( fwf ) propagating in the asymptotic regions of an isolated source , @xmath5 , is the transverse - traceless ( tt ) projection of the metric deviation at the leading - order @xmath6 in the distance @xmath7 to the source , in a radiative - type coordinate system @xmath8 .",
    "the fwf can be uniquely decomposed @xcite into radiative multipole components parametrized by symmetric - trace - free ( stf ) mass - type moments @xmath9 and current - type ones @xmath10 . for a multi - index composed of @xmath11 multipolar spatial indices",

    "the results of sections [ secv][secvi ] yield the complete control of the _ instantaneous _ part of the fwf .",
    "we now tackle the computation of the _ hereditary _ part , which is composed of tails ( and tails - of - tails and squared - tails ) and non - linear memory terms .",

    "we first consider the non - linear memory terms . up",
    "to 3pn order we have the 2.5pn memory integrals in the radiative mass quadrupole moment @xmath248 given by and the radiative mass hexadecapole moment @xmath251 given by  these are the memory terms contributing to the fwf at 2.5pn order @xcite  and , in addition , we have the memory integral in the mass octupole moment @xmath250 given by and the one in @xmath253 given by  these contribute specifically at 3pn order .. ] like in @xcite we obtain the corresponding integrands ( _ i.e. _ the terms under the integral sign ) and compute directly their contributions to the two wave polarizations @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "indeed it is convenient to perform the relevant contractions of the integrands with the polarization vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( see section [ secviii ] for the conventions we adopt ) so as to only deal with _",
    "scalar _ quantities .",
    "we find that the memory integrals in @xmath39 and @xmath40 are composed of two types of terms .",
    "first there is a term , only present in the plus polarization @xmath39 , which does not depend on the orbital phase and can thus be viewed as a _ zero - frequency _ ( dc ) term .",
    "actually , because of the steady inspiral , this term is a steadily varying function of time , with an amplitude increasing like some power law of the time remaining till the coalescence . strictly speaking ,",
    "this term is to be regarded as _",
    "the _ memory contribution because it does depend on the behaviour of the system in the remote past , and therefore must be computed using some model for the evolution of the binary system in the past . in the present paper",
    "we find that the only zero - frequency term up to 3pn order is the one which appeared already at 2.5pn order and was evaluated in @xcite  interestingly there are no other terms of this type at the 3pn order . because of the cumulative effect of integration over the whole past we know that this term , though originating from 2.5pn order , finally contributes in the fwf at the newtonian level @xcite . in practice",
    "the computation of this dc term reduces ( in the circular orbit case ) to the evaluation of the single elementary integral @xmath467 here @xmath468 denotes the binary s separation at any time @xmath469 ( where @xmath29 is the current time ) . the coefficient in front of",
    "is chosen for convenience to make the integral dimensionless .",
    "the integral is easily computed using a simplified model of binary evolution in the past in which the orbit is assumed to remain circular apart from the gradual inspiral at any time . in this model",
    "the binary separation evolves like @xmath470 where @xmath471 denotes the instant of coalescence ( see @xcite for more details ) . in the remote past we thus have @xmath472 so the integral",
    "converges when @xmath473 ( actually we shall only need the case @xmath474 like in @xcite ) .",
    "the result reads @xmath475 where @xmath476 denotes the _ current _ value ( _ i.e. _ at the current retarded time @xmath477 ) of the parameter @xmath452 defined by .",
    "witness the memory effect : the end result is of order @xmath478 which is a factor @xmath479 _ larger _ than the original formal pn order @xmath480 as shown in .",
    "hence , although the memory term is formally of order 2.5pn , its actual contribution to the waveform is comparable to a newtonian term . as mentioned above we",
    "do not find memory ( zero - frequency ) contributions originating from the next 3pn order , and therefore finally no dc term at 0.5pn order .",
    "second there are other terms , present in both polarizations , which depend on the orbital phase , and oscillate like some harmonics of the orbital phase ( say @xmath481 ) .",
    "such phase - dependent , oscillating terms do not exhibit the memory effect , essentially because the oscillations , due to the sequence of orbital cycles in the entire life of the binary system , more or less compensate each other . as a result",
    "these terms , in contrast with  , keep on their formal pn order .",
    "we recover the 2.5pn terms investigated in @xcite and in addition we obtain several other terms at 3pn order .",
    "the latter are computed by a slight generalization of the method followed in @xcite : instead of ( 4.18 ) in @xcite we need to consider the integral @xmath482 where @xmath483 is the orbital phase at any time , where @xmath93 and @xmath224 range over integer or half - integer values ( _ e.g. _ @xmath484 and @xmath485 at 3pn order ) , and where the coefficient is chosen to make the integral dimensionless . following the steps ( 4.18)(4.23 ) in @xcite we compute this integral using our model of binary s past evolution , and in the adiabatic limit , which means that the _ current _ value of the adiabatic parameter @xmath486 associated with the binary inspiral is considered to be small and of pn order @xmath487 .",
    "we then find @xmath488\\,.\\ ] ] this result ( valid only if @xmath489 ) permits to handle all the phase - dependent oscillating terms coming from the memory integrals .",
    "we next turn to the computation of the tails and tails - of - tails present in the radiative moments . again we closely follow the previous investigation @xcite on which we refer for more details .",
    "the computation of tails reduces to the evaluation of an elementary integral involving a logarithmic kernel , @xmath490 in which the logarithm has been scaled with the constant time @xmath491 , instead of the previous normalization by @xmath492 , where @xmath471 is the instant of coalescence in the model of @xcite .",
    "such scaling can always be done at the price of adding another term proportional to some integral of the type @xmath493 computed previously . following the derivation of this integral in @xcite",

    "the adiabatic parameter is related to the pn parameter @xmath452 by @xmath498 the squared - tails are computed using the same integral . concerning the tails - of - tails we simply have to consider an integral involving a logarithm squared , @xmath499 which is computed using the same technique with the result @xmath500\\,.\\ ] ] we are done with the computation of all tails and tails - of - tails in the 3pn waveform .    for completeness let us give also the two technical formulas which enable ones to arrive at the results and . posing @xmath501 and @xmath502 , and working at the leading order in the adiabatic limit @xmath503 or equivalently when @xmath504 , the formulas express that , for any positive or negative @xmath505 ( see _ e.g. _",

    "the reason is that the _ remote past _ contribution , given by @xmath509 or equivalently @xmath510 , is small in the adiabatic limit .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of tails : they die out very rapidly , therefore they depend essentially on the recent past evolution of the matter source @xcite .",
    "in the case at hand this technically means that the remote - past contributions to the integrals are of order    [ remotepast]@xmath511    as can easily be verified by using integration by parts .",
    "we specify our conventions for the orbital phase and polarization vectors defining the polarization waveforms in the case of quasi - circular binary systems of non - spinning compact objects . if the orbital plane is chosen to be the x - y plane ( like in section [ secvi ] ) , with the orbital phase @xmath445 measuring the direction of the unit vector @xmath512 along the relative separation vector , then @xmath513 where @xmath514 and @xmath515 are the unit directions along x and y. following @xcite we choose the polarization vector @xmath35 to lie along the x - axis and the observer to be in the y - z plane with @xmath516 where we pose @xmath517 and @xmath518 , with @xmath45 being the orbit s inclination angle ( @xmath519 ) . with this choice @xmath35",

    "in addition they will involve , at high pn order , the logarithm of @xmath452 as we shall discuss below .",
    "following @xcite it is convenient to perform a change of phase variable , from the actual orbital phase @xmath445 satisfying @xmath528 , to some new variable denoted @xmath529 .",
    "recall that the orbital phase @xmath445 evolves by gravitational radiation reaction and its expression as a function of time is known from previous work @xcite up to 3.5pn order .",
    "we then pose @xmath530 where @xmath133 is the binary s total mass given by , and where @xmath531 denotes the constant @xmath532 here @xmath344 is the normalization of logarithms in the tail integrals of the radiative moments  ; @xmath103 is the constant included in the definition of the finite part in . like @xmath343 the constant @xmath531 is arbitrary , because it is linked to the difference of origins of time in the far zone and in the near zone , see .",
    "for instance we can choose @xmath533 where @xmath534 is the entry frequency of some ground - based interferometric detector .",
    "using and the notation the new phase variable reads @xmath535\\ln\\left({x\\over x_0}\\right ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath536 . in agreement with the equation ( 68 ) of @xcite . ]",
    "our modified phase variable  will be valid up to 3pn order but in fact it turns out to be the same as at the previous 2.5pn order @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic term in @xmath529 corresponds to some spreading of the different frequency components of the wave along the line of sight from the source to the far - away detector , and expresses physically the tail effect as a small delay in the arrival time of gravitational waves .",
    "however , practically speaking , the main interest of this term is to minimize the occurence of logarithms in the fwf .",
    "indeed we notice that the logarithmic term in , although of formal pn order @xmath537 , represents in fact a very small modulation of the orbital phase : compared with the dominant phase evolution whose order is that of the inverse of radiation reaction , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath538 , this term is of order @xmath539 namely 4pn in the phase evolution , which can be regarded as negligible to the present accuracy .",
    "thus the logarithms associated with the phase modulation in will be `` eliminated '' from the fwf at 3pn order .",
    "this does not mean that we should ignore them but that the formulation in terms of the small phase modulation is quite natural ( for the data analysis it is probably better to keep the logarithm as it stands in the definition of the phase variable @xmath529 ) .",
    "however all the logarithms will not be `` removed '' by this process , and we shall find that some `` true '' logarithms remain starting at the 3pn order .",
    "such logarithms can not be absorbed into some small modulation of the orbital phase , so 3pn will remain as the true order of magnitude of these logarithms in the fwf .    with those conventions and notation we find for the plus polarization      for the cross polarizations we obtain      notice the obvious fact that the polarization waveforms remain invariant when we rotate by @xmath542 the separation direction between the particles and simultaneously exchange the labels of the two particles , _",
    "i.e. _ when we apply the transformation @xmath543 . moreover , due to the parity invariance , @xmath544 is unchanged after the replacement @xmath545 , while @xmath546 being the projection of @xmath5 on a tensorial product of two vectors of inverse parity types , is changed into its opposite .",
    "we have performed two important tests on these expressions .",

    "the spin - weighted spherical harmonic modes of the polarization waveforms at 3pn order can now be obtained from using the angular integration .",
    "an alternative route would be to use the relations  giving the modes directly in terms of separate contributions of the radiative moments @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the present paper",
    "the two routes are equivalent because all the radiative moments are `` uniformly '' given with the approximation that is necessary and sufficient to control the 3pn waveform .    in this respect",
    "one should be careful about what we mean by controlling the modes up to 3pn order .",
    "we mean  having in mind the standard pn practice  that the accuracy of the modes is exactly the one which is needed to obtain the 3pn waveform .",
    "thus the dominant mode @xmath557 will have full 3pn accuracy , but higher - order modes , which start at some higher pn order , will have a lower _ relative _ pn accuracy .",

    "<S> the gravitational waveform ( gwf ) generated by inspiralling compact binaries moving in quasi - circular orbits is computed at the third post - newtonian ( 3pn ) approximation to general relativity . </S>",

    "<S> this extension of the gwf by half a pn order ( with respect to previous work at 2.5pn order ) is based on the algorithm of the multipolar post - minkowskian formalism , and mandates the computation of the relations between the radiative , canonical and source multipole moments for general sources at 3pn order . </S>",
