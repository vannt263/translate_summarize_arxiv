    "they found a median absolute amplitude of the non - circular motions , averaged over their entire sample , of 6.7  . from the measured non - circular velocity components they determined the mean elongation of the gravitational potential to be @xmath5 , consistent with a round potential .    in this work we search for non - circular flows in the extended  disc of the nearby ( @xmath6  mpc ,",

    "a slightly more subtle , yet arguably more pertinent question to answer , is whether having fixed the position angle of the bi - symmetric distortion to @xmath107 , i.e. to that of the bar - like feature seen in the  distribution , leaves the bi - symmetric models insensitive to bi - symmetric distortions that are not aligned with this feature . to address this concern ,",

    "@xcite used hydrodynamical simulations to show that ngc  2915 s observed  spiral structure can be accounted for by either an unseen bar or a rotating tri - axial dark matter halo .",
    "a problem with the bar scenario is , however , that the mass of the required bar ( @xmath112  ) is very large relative to the total stellar mass of the galaxy ( @xmath113  ) , thereby making the nature of such a bar problematic .",
    "our second independent attempt at quantifying the non - circular gas motions in the  disc of ngc  2915 involves an harmonic decomposition of the line - of - sight - velocities and then , using the theoretical framework laid down by @xcite and @xcite , connecting the measured kinematics to perturbations of the potential .",

    "the @xmath135 term is close to zero for all radii , thereby providing evidence against the perturbational effects of a two - armed spiral density wave to the observed velocity field .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the bi - symmetric models fitted by velfit to the velocity field are insensitive to spiral structure , yet still suggest the presence of sizeable non - circular @xmath27 and @xmath28 velocity components , implies that the strong @xmath130 term found by reswri can not solely be due to spiral structure .",
    "the strong @xmath130 term could also be linked to an axisymmetric radial flow . in their description of the kinematic signatures of different types of non - circular motions , @xcite state that a significant @xmath130 term together with a negligible @xmath135 term can be caused by radial gas inflow .",
    "we indeed see this behaviour in the harmonic terms of ngc  2915 .",
    "@xcite go on to list @xmath136 over a significant radial range as a further kinematic signature of radial flow .",
    "we measure an average absolute gradient of @xmath137 for the outer disc of ngc  2915 , consistent with the radial flow scenario .",
    "a further kinematic signature of radial flow is non - orthogonality of the kinematic major and minor axes . from the circular tilted ring model fitted by reswri to the  velocity field , the position angle of the kinematic major axis",

    "the iso - velocity contours in the  velocity field suggest the position angle of the kinematic minor axis to be @xmath138  212 .",
    "the two kinematic axes thus appear to be non - orthogonal , differing in position angle by only @xmath138  75 , thereby further supporting the possibility of radial flow .",
    "this evidence for radial flows is further supported by the fact that velfit finds an axisymmetric radial flow model to better match the observed  velocity field of ngc  2915 than does a bi - symmetric flow model .",
    "this is true regardless of whether the bar angle in the bi - symmetric flow model is kept fixed or is allowed to freely vary .",
    "@xcite mention that if the @xmath130 term is interpreted as evidence for radial flow , then in a counter - clockwise rotating galaxy , a positive @xmath130 term implies outflow . assuming that a galaxy s spiral arms are always trailing , ngc 2915 is rotating counter - clockwise , thereby implying the strong @xmath130 term to be indicative of a radial outflow of the order of @xmath139",
    "this result is similar to that of @xcite who inferred the presence of radial inflows of the order of @xmath140  in the  disc of the nearby dwarf irregular galaxy ngc  3741 .",

    "this gas , they say , forms `` a reservoir of fresh gas for fuelling star formation in the inner regions '' . the physical process of gas moving from the outer to the inner disc would , however , be associated with an axisymmetric radial _ inflow _ , and is hence difficult to reconcile with our kinematic evidence for a radial outflow . @xcite have recently reported on lower- and higher - than - expected oxygen abundances for the respective inner and outer portions of ngc  2915 s  disc .",
    "the authors showed that the few isolated regions of low - level star formation within the outer disc can not account for the measured oxygen abundance .",
    "they propose a metal - mixing scenario in which metals produced by the star forming core are radially redistributed towards the outer disc .",
    "such a scenario is consistent with our kinematic evidence for radial outflows .",
    "furthermore , several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) strongly advocate the presence of a bar within ngc  2915 s co - rotation radius .",
    "if mass is able to flow along this bar towards the centre of the galaxy , conservation of angular momentum dictates that some mass must also be sent outwards , away from the centre of the system .",
    "our inferred outward radial motions are consistent with this physical scenario which could perhaps go some way in explaining the existence of ngc  2915 s very extended  disc .",
    "a major flaw in the radial flow argument is that the velocity field of a stationary bar potential resembles axisymmetric inflow or outflow .",
    "this , according to @xcite , is because for a flat rotation curve the @xmath135 and @xmath129 terms are expected to vanish in the case of a stationary perturbation to the potential ( demonstrated by @xcite ) .",
    "bars are indeed thought to be the most effective mechanism for transporting gas to the centre of a galaxy @xcite , and so the kinematics alone can not distinguish between the stationary bar potential and the radial flow scenarios .",
    "@xcite carried out harmonic decompositions of the co and  velocity fields of seven nearby spiral galaxies in order to search for evidence of radial gas flows .",
    "they found no unambiguous evidence for radial flows , concluding that `` the inherent non - axisymmetry of spiral galaxies is the greatest limitation to the direct detection of radial flows '' .",
