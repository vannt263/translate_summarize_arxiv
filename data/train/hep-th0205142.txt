    "when computing the quasinormal mode one has to truncate the sum representing the wave function @xmath48 with some large @xmath49 and find the roots of the equation @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "after simplification the truncated sum ( [ 3 ] ) takes the polynomial in @xmath1 form , and the necessary roots can easily be found by _",
    "mathematica_. however this reduction to a polynomial form takes a lot of computer time and can not be performed for a sum of order @xmath52 or more .",
    "thus for small black holes we have to use the trial and error method . herewith there is a danger of missing the fundamental mode we are seeking , and , of `` catching '' another overtone .",
    "fortunately , for reasonably small black holes there are no other overtones close to the fundamental one , and the minimums of @xmath53 are sufficiently widely separated .",
    "another difficulty is that for small values of @xmath5 the initial tiny errors when determining the quantities involved in the sum in ( [ 3 ] ) ( namely @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 of the paper @xcite ) begin to grow when coming to @xmath49 of order @xmath57 or greater .",
    "therefore one has to improve precision of these quantities ( with the help of a build - in function of mathematica ) up until further increasing of precision will not influence the result .",
    "it proved out , that the @xmath58-digital precision of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 is quite enough in this paper .",
    "in addition on must set higher precision of recurrence relations for coefficients @xmath59 .",
    "when approaching the limit @xmath60 the number @xmath49 of the truncated sum ( [ 3 ] ) at which an approximate frequency converge grows as is shown on the fig.5 for @xmath29 .",
    "the more @xmath61 , the more the number @xmath49 giving good approximation of the frequency .",
    "when following all these receptions one can be sure that the convergence plot will be smooth and that at small changing of @xmath5 the corresponding frequency will not change noisily ."

    "<S> the computations shows that when the horizon radius is much less than the anti - de - sitter radius , the imaginary part of the frequency goes to zero as @xmath0 while the real part of @xmath1 decreases to its minimum and then goes to @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> this agrees with suggestions of horowitz et al ( _ phys.rev . _ * d62 * 024027 ( 2000 ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> original interest to quasinormal modes of black holes arose since they are the characteristics of black holes which do not depend on initial perturbations and are functions of a black hole parameters only . at present , this interest is renewed since the qn frequencies are in the suggested region of the gravitational wave detectors which are under construction . </S>",
    "<S> in general qnm s are important in black holes dynamics and appear in such processes as collisions of two black holes , decay of different fields in a bh background .    </S>",
    "<S> all this motivated the investigation of the qnm of black holes in asymptotically flat space - time ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quasinormal modes of asymptotically de - sitter black holes were studied in @xcite,@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently an unexpected application of quasinormal modes have appeared due to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite : it proved out that a large black hole in ads space corresponds to an approximately thermal state in the cft , and , thereby , perturbation of the black hole corresponds to the perturbation of the above thermal state , while the decay of the perturbation can be associated with the return to thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> thus the qn frequencies give us the thermalization timescale which is very hard to compute directly . </S>",
    "<S> quasinormal modes for different types of perturbations of black holes in ads space have been studied recently in a lot of papers @xcite-@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> black holes are considered to be small ( large ) , when its horizon radius is much smaller ( larger ) then the anti - de - sitter radius . </S>",
    "<S> when computing the qn frequencies associated with the decay of massless scalar field in the background of small sads bh a striking conjecture with the black hole critical phenomena was found : @xmath4 is proportional to bh radius @xmath5 to high accuracy , and the slope of the line @xmath4 to the @xmath5 axis , 2.66 , turned out to be very close to the special frequency @xmath6 which corresponds to the growing mode @xmath7 describing the late time behaviour of the critical solution @xcite . yet </S>",
    "<S> , the quasinormal frequencies of the sads black hole have been computed only for black holes with horizon radius @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the anti - de - sitter radius ( except for one mode corresponding to @xmath10 for which the behavior of the wave function was numerically reproduced ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is not sufficient to study the small black hole limit , but several suggestions were made . in @xcite it was stated that both real and imaginary parts of the qn modes for small black holes are very large and proportional to the surface gravity , however , later , it was shown by numerical integration of the wave equation , that at least for @xmath8 , in agreement with the first study @xcite , @xcite , that both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath1 are decreasing , and , stated that the behaviour @xmath11 , @xmath12 at @xmath3 is expected . </S>",

    "<S> we try to compute the quasinormal modes of black holes with the horizon radius smaller than @xmath14 , to approach the small black holes regime @xmath15 as much as possible , and to obtain more definite hints of very small black hole behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> it proves out that computations of quasinormal modes for very small black holes are quite reliable within the method proposed in @xcite provided one avoids accumulating of numerical error ( see appendix ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the d - dimensional schwarzschild - anti - de - sitter metric is : @xmath16 where @xmath17 here @xmath18 is related to the black hole mass @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the area of a unit ( d-2 ) sphere .    </S>",
    "<S> quasinormal modes of black holes in asymptotically anti - de - sitter space time are governed by the wave equation @xmath21 where the potential @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 and we take @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the tortoise coordinate is @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the angular harmonic index . by rescaling of @xmath27 we can put @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> it is essential that the effective potential is infinite at spatial infinity . </S>",
    "<S> thus the wave function vanishes at infinity and satisfies the purely in - going wave condition at the black hole horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> we managed to computed the quasinormal modes for the @xmath29 black hole with the radius up to @xmath30 ( see fig1 - 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this reasonably approximates behavior in small black hole regime . </S>",
    "<S> it proved out that the oscillation frequency falls down to some minimum , and then begins to grow approaching @xmath2 when @xmath3 ( see fig 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this minimum of the @xmath31 equals @xmath32 @xmath33 and ( according to our preliminary results ) continues to increase for higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> herewith the more dimensional ads space is the less black hole radius @xmath5 at which the real oscillation frequency attains its minimum . upon thorough consideration of the fig.1 of the paper @xcite one can learn that among the real oscillation frequencies corresponding to @xmath34 , @xmath35 at @xmath36 is the least . </S>",

    "<S> the imaginary part of @xmath1 fall down to zero , and the closer @xmath5 to zero the better the corresponding plot can be fit by the function @xmath38 . for @xmath29 the best fit for the last five points ( from @xmath39 to @xmath40 ) in the tab.1 is @xmath41 . </S>",
