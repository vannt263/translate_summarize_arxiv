    "observations using the solar optical telescope ( sot ) aboard _ hinode _ @xcite and the coronal multi - channel polarimeter ( comp ) @xcite unambiguously reveal ubiquitous alfvnic oscillations in the solar corona , with implications both for the sun s atmosphere and the solar wind .",
    "@xcite find that coronal alfvnic power is broadly spread in frequency , but with a distinct peak around 3 - 4 mhz , characteristic of the sun s internal @xmath0-mode wavefield .",
    "whether these transverse oscillations are strictly alfvn waves or instead kink waves @xcite depends on the magnetic and density structuring of the atmosphere , and may vary with height as cross - field structuring becomes more or less important .",
    "we might expect though that sunspot atmospheres , with their presumed large - scale magnetic structures , present the most ideal site for more - or - less pure alfvn waves to propagate .",
    "the generation of alfvn waves at the photosphere and their propagation through the various layers of the solar atmosphere has been extensively modelled ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite recently suggested that alfvn waves must also be produced by mode conversion from fast magneto - acoustic waves beyond their reflection height in the low chromosphere .",
    "this coupling only occurs if wave propagation is not co - planar with gravity and magnetic field , and so the problem is necessarily three dimensional ( 3d ) .",
    "conversion from fast - mode high-@xmath1 magneto - acoustic waves ( manifesting as @xmath0 modes in the subphotosphere ) to slow - mode waves in solar active regions is relatively well studied both analytically and numerically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the transformation from fast to slow magnetoacoustic modes is demonstrated to be particularly strong for a narrow range of magnetic field inclinations around 2030 degrees to the vertical .",

    "@xcite , coupling the sun s interior oscillations to those of its atmosphere .",
    "the remainder of the wave - energy flux though , which is near - total away from these preferred inclinations , enters the low-@xmath1 atmosphere as fast , predominantly magnetic waves . due to the steep alfvn speed gradient with height , these fast waves soon reflect back downward at the height @xmath2 at which @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the frequency , @xmath5 the alfvn speed , and @xmath6 the horizontal wavenumber .",
    "fast - to - alfvn conversion occurs around and above this fast wave reflection height @xmath2 in 3d ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : alfschem ] ) , localized more closely to @xmath2 as frequency increases @xcite .",
    "however , at the 3 - 5 mhz frequencies characteristic of @xmath0-modes , the process is typically spread over much of the chromosphere . studies of fast - to - alfvn conversion were initiated by @xcite , who found that it is most efficient for preferred field inclinations from vertical between 30 and 40 degrees , and azimuth angles ( the angle between the vertical magnetic and wave propagation planes ) between 60 and 80 degrees , and that alfvnic fluxes transmitted to the upper atmosphere can exceed acoustic fluxes in some cases .",
    "@xcite studied the conversion properties of low - frequency ( @xmath7 - 2 mhz ) gravity waves , showing that even larger magnetic field inclinations can support gravity wave to alfvn conversion and resulting alfvnic wave propagation to the upper atmosphere . in nonuniform magnetic field ,",

    "this approximation means that we allow all vectors in three spatial directions , but the derivatives are taken only in two ( one vertical and one horizontal ) directions , so that our perturbations are only allowed to propagate in the @xmath10 plane .",
    "in addition , the initial perturbation is kept small to approximate the linear regime .    as a background magneto - static model atmosphere",
    "we use one sunspot - like model from @xcite . for simplicity",

    "the computational region is magnetized in all its volume ( distributed currents ) , but the strongest magnetic field is concentrated around the axis of the structure .",

    "the thermodynamic variables of the atmosphere at 39 mm from the axis are taken from model s of @xcite in the deep sub - photosphere layers and continuing according to the val - c model @xcite in the photospheric and chromospheric layers .",
    "the sunspot axis in the atmospheric layers is given by the semi - empirical model of @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field at the axis is about 900 g at @xmath14 mm .",
    "this is quite moderate for a sunspot , but is adopted for numerical reasons .",
    "the alfvn speed at the top of our computational domain becomes quite excessive if the field strength is too high , thereby necessitating impractically small time steps .",
    "taking larger field strength would mostly result in a different scaling of the problem , without new physical phenomena being introduced ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spatial resolution of our simulations is 150 km in the horizontal direction and 50 km in the vertical direction ( 520 by 148 grid points ) .",
    "the upper 500 km ( 10 grid points ) of the domain are occupied by the absorbing pml boundary layer @xcite , so the effective physical boundary of the domain is located at 1.9 mm above the photosphere .",
    "the pml , `` perfectly matched layer '' , is a numerical device that acts as an excellent absorber of waves , and thereby removes unphysical reflections from the edges of the computational domain .",
    "it is well - tested in the current code , and performs admirably .",
    "no significant reflections are detected .",
    "the concept of pml was firstly introduced by @xcite for electromagnetic waves , but was quickly extended to other wave types",

    "the calculations throughout are adiabatic and we use the ideal equation of state to close the system .    as our modelling is 2.5d , we have made cuts through the sunspot model at several @xmath15 positions . here",
    "we will describe three simulations situated in vertical planes at @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 mm from the sunspot axis .",
    "a cut through the axis is uninteresting , as it is strictly 2d and can produce no alfvn waves .",
    "figure [ fig : sunspot ] depicts variations of some characteristic parameters of the @xmath16 mm cut through the sunspot model .",
    "we drive waves by an imposed perturbation in a few grid points near the bottom boundary of the domain at @xmath19 mm .",
    "the perturbation is calculated analytically as an acoustic - gravity wave of a given frequency and wavenumber , neglecting the magnetic field ( dynamically unimportant at this depth ) , and neglecting the temperature gradient .",
    "we introduce self - consistent perturbations of the velocity vector , pressure , and density according to @xcite : @xmath20 where the amplitudes and relative phase shifts between the perturbations are given by @xmath21 given the wave frequency @xmath4 , and the horizontal wavenumber @xmath22 , the vertical wavenumber @xmath23 is found from the dispersion relation for acoustic - gravity waves in an isothermal atmosphere : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the acoustic cut - off frequency and @xmath26 .    in all simulations described in this work we set the perturbation frequency @xmath27 mhz and horizontal wave number @xmath28 mm@xmath29 . according to our sunspot model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sunspot ] ) , the driving frequency is just slightly below the maximum cut - off frequency reached at the temperature minimum . over most of the spot",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] these projections were shown to be rather efficient in separating the perturbations corresponding to all three modes both for idealized magnetic field configurations @xcite , and also for more complex ones @xcite .",
    "the first projection ( @xmath37 ) selects the slow magneto - acoustic wave , propagating parallel to the field ; the second one ( @xmath38 ) selects the alfvn wave , according to the asymptotic polarization direction derived by @xcite ; the remaining orthogonal direction ( @xmath39 ) selects the fast magneto - acoustic wave . in the rest of the paper we will address these projections as `` acoustic '' , `` alfvn '' and `` fast '' .",
    "to measure the efficiency of conversion to alfvn waves near and above the @xmath40 equipartition layer , we calculate the time - averaged acoustic and magnetic energy fluxes as far as possible from the conversion layer in the magnetically dominated atmosphere ( @xmath35 ) : @xmath41 the positive sign of the fluxes means energy propagating upwards .",
    "we also calculate a measure of the time - averaged energy contained in all three wave modes according to @xmath42 where in each case we use the corresponding velocity projections into characteristic directions ( eq .",
    "[ eq : directions ] ) . for pure acoustic and alfvn waves , where there is strict equipartition between kinetic and compressional or kinetic and magnetic energies respectively",
    ", these would indeed be the true energies .",
    "be that as it may , these forms are convenient for purposes of exposition and shall be used here .",
    "figure [ fig : vtime ] shows an example of the projected velocity components in our calculations as a function of height and time .",
    "the velocities are taken at @xmath43 mm , where the distinction between the three wave modes in the magnetically dominated atmosphere is clearly visible . in this representation",
    "the larger inclination of the ridges means lower propagation speeds and vice versa .",
    "note , that projecting the velocities according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : directions ] ) allows us to separate the wave modes only in the magnetically dominated atmosphere , above the horizontal solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : vtime ] .",
    "the figure shows how the incident fast mode wave propagates to the equipartition layer @xmath40 gradually changing its speed . after reaching the equipartition layer at about 5 min into the simulation , it splits into several components .",
    "the essentially magnetic low-@xmath1 fast mode is produced above @xmath44 mm ( middle panel ) .",
    "this mode is reflected back down a few minutes after it has been produced .",
    "the reflection height , calculated as the height where the wave frequency @xmath4 and wave horizontal wave number @xmath22 are related by @xmath45 ( ignoring the sound speed contribution to the fast wave speed ) , is well reproduced in the simulations , as the velocity variations associated with the fast mode decay rapidly above its reflection layer .        unlike the purely 2d case",
    ", there is an alfvn mode produced above the @xmath40 level ( right panel ) .",
    "this mode has a clearly distinct propagation speed compared to the acoustic mode ( left panel ) .",
    "the ridges of the alfvn mode are nearly vertical since the alfvn speed at these heights is large ( above 100 @xmath46 ) .",
    "the low-@xmath1 essentially acoustic slow mode escapes to the upper atmosphere tunnelling through the cut - off layer due to the field inclination of @xmath47 = 30  that effectively reduces the cut - off frequency by the factor @xmath48 .",
    "the velocity amplitudes in fig .",
    "[ fig : vtime ] are scaled with a factor of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 for the @xmath51 component and @xmath52 for the other two components . although @xmath35 above the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : vtime ] , the scaled amplitudes of the alfvn mode are still smaller than of the slow acoustic mode at the selected @xmath11 location .",
    "figure [ fig : vtime ] also shows that the simulation enters into a stationary stage after about 10 - 15 min .",
    "a snapshot of the wave field developed in the stationary stage of the simulations is given in figure [ fig : vsnapshot ] .",
    "the movie of this simulation is available electronically .",
    "the behaviour of the three wave modes changes across the sunspot radial direction , as expected due to the change of the atmospheric properties .",
    "the magnetic field is more inclined at the periphery of the sunspot ( much more so than is suggested by the figures , since the vertical scale has been stretched relative to the horizontal scale ) and the azimuth varies from @xmath53  to 180  from the right to the left hand side of the sunspot .",
    "the cut - off frequency reaches its maximum of 5.02 mhz at @xmath54 , @xmath14 mm , decreasing steeply above this due to the rise of temperature in the chromosphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sunspot ] ) .",
    "this steep temperature increase produces a partial reflection of the slow acoustic mode in the magnetically dominated atmosphere .",
    "this reflection is visible as an interference pattern formed above the solid line in the @xmath51 projection in the left part of the sunspot ( upper panel ) .",
    "this additional reflection also produces stronger slow magnetic modes below the @xmath40 line in the left part of the sunspot due to the secondary mode transformation from the downgoing waves .",
    "the fast magnetic mode reflection above @xmath55 is complete in the central part of the sunspot , though the evanescent tail ( the exponentially decaying part of the fast wave above the classical reflection point ) still does not fully fit in the computational box even here . at the periphery ,",
    "the height of the simulation domain is insufficient for the fast mode to complete its reflection and it is partly absorbed by the pml boundary condition .",
    "this produces artificially large fast mode amplitudes at the periphery of the sunspot .    the alfvn mode component generated after",
    "the transformation is stronger at the horizontal locations where the fast wave is reflected at lower heights ( @xmath56  @xmath57 mm ) .",
    "the reason for a this is apparent from fig .  10b of @xcite :",
    "the fast - to - alfvn conversion region is distributed throughout the evanescent tail of the fast wave beyond its reflection point . at the frequencies and wavenumbers typical of our simulations here ,",
    "that amounts to 20 scale heights or more ! since our computational box is truncated only a few scale heights above @xmath2 , we can sample only a small part of the conversion process .",
    "where @xmath2 is lower ( in the center of fig .",
    "3c ) the alfvn conversion is of course enhanced relative to where it is higher simply because our box includes more of the conversion region there .",
    "our experiments at 25 mhz , with @xmath22 also increased by a factor of five , confirm this explanation , as for those waves the evanescent tail is much shorter and the conversion region therefore more compact .",
    "as expected , the higher frequency simulations yield substantially higher alfvn fluxes ( see section [ sect : fluxes ] ) .",
    "we proceed by measuring the energies contained in each of the projected velocity components at the upper part of our simulation domain , above the alfvn - acoustic equipartition layer @xmath40 . as the properties of the atmosphere change in the horizontal direction across the sunspot , the height of the @xmath40 layer changes as well ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sunspot ] ) . to be consistent ,",
    "we take time averaged energies at heights from 400 km above the @xmath40 layer up to the upper boundary of our simulation box in the stationary stage of the simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : amplitudes ] illustrates the energies as a function of inclination and azimuth of the sunspot magnetic field lines at the corresponding horizontal locations .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field is taken at heights where @xmath40 in each of the simulations at three @xmath15 locations .",
    "the three strips in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] are for the three simulation runs .",
    "the format of the figure allows comparison with the previous studies , @xcite figure 2 and @xcite figure 4 .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the maximum energy of slow acoustic waves is transmitted for inclinations around 30 degrees ( left panel ) .",
    "the dependence on the inclination is stronger than the dependence on the azimuth .",
    "this result is consistent with previous 2d theoretical models of fast - to - slow mode transformation in the homogeneous inclined magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the 3d analysis by @xcite .",
    "the explanation of this effect is offered by the ray perspective .",
    "the fast - mode high-@xmath1 waves launched from the sub - photospheric layers ( with an angle about 90 degrees , i.e. their lower turning point ) reach the alfvn - acoustic equipartition layer with an angle close to @xmath58 degrees @xcite .",
    "thus , for the moderately inclined magnetic field the attack angle between the wavevector and the magnetic field lines is small and the transformation is efficient .",
    "note also that the frequency of waves is just at the cut - off frequency of the sunspot atmosphere , so due to tunneling effects the slow mode acoustic energy is also present over the wide range of inclinations .            the maximum energy of the alfvn wave is present at inclinations about 35  and azimuth between 70  and 100(right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] ) . the maximum power increases from the outer to the inner strip indicating a tendency towards larger transmission at larger inclinations .",
    "thus , the behaviour of waves in sunspot models is similar to the one found previously in the models with homogeneous field @xcite .",
    "the transmission of alfvn waves is more efficient for inclined fields , which is important in the sunspot penumbra .",
    "some transmitted energy is also present in the @xmath59 component ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] ) near the sunspot periphery , though we believe this to be an artefact of our computational box not being tall enough to allow complete fast wave reflection there .",
    "to check if projecting the velocities in the directions given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : directions ] ) gives an efficient way to separate the alfvn mode from the fast and slow magneto - acoustic modes , we make use of the polarization relations for the alfvn wave . in a classical alfvn wave variations of the magnetic field and velocity should be related as ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath60 where the upper sign is for alfvn waves propagating parallel to the magnetic field and the lower sign is for those propagating in the opposite direction .",
    "the kinetic and magnetic energy for an alfvn wave should be in equipartition , so the ratio @xmath61 should be equal to one .        to confirm the alfvn nature of the transformed waves",
    ", we checked the amplitude and phase relations for all three modes reaching the upper atmosphere .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio ] presents calculations of the amplitude ratio @xmath62 for the three modes . in each of the cases",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 pairs are the projections in the corresponding characteristic direction for each mode ( eq .  [ eq : directions ] ) .",
    "the ratio is taken at the same heights as the energies from fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] and is averaged in time in the stationary stage of the simulations .",
    "the ratio turns out to be different for the three modes . in the case of the slow acoustic mode ( left panel ) , the magnetic field variations associated with the velocity variations are very small ( ratio @xmath62 about @xmath65 ) . in contrast , in the case of the fast magnetic mode , magnetic field amplitudes are relatively strong providing the ratio about @xmath66 ( middle panel ) . for the alfvn mode the ratio stays around @xmath67 ( right panel ) meaning that the velocity and magnetic field oscillations are in equipartition as expected for an alfvn wave .",
    "figure [ fig : phase ] shows the phase shift between the @xmath68 and @xmath69 corresponding to the alfvn mode .",
    "the situation here is very different from what one might navely expect .",
    "it is also different to the case of the simple atmosphere and homogeneous magnetic field considered by us previously in @xcite . in the right part of the sunspot , for the azimuth between 0  and 90",
    "the alfvn waves mostly behave as they should .",
    "the phase shift is about 180 , meaning an upward wave propagation . nevertheless , in the left part of the sunspot ( @xmath70 between 90  and 180 ) the value of the phase shift indicates a downward propagation . taking into account that the amplitude ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ) gives clear evidence for the alfvnic nature of the waves , we conclude that for @xmath71 between 90  and 180  downward - propagating alfvn waves are generated by the mode transformation .",
    "this accords perfectly with the uniform field modeling results of @xcite ( see their figures 4 and 5 ) indicating that between 0 and 90 the upward propagating fast waves couple most efficiently to upward alfvn waves . since an alignment is needed between the direction of the wave propagation and magnetic field for efficient coupling , where the azimuth is between 90 and 180 the strongest coupling happens between the downward propagating fast waves ( after their reflection in the magnetically dominated atmosphere ) and the alfvn waves . in this case",
    "downward propagating alfvn waves are produced .",
    "we believe the same happens in the simulations , producing downward propagating alfvn waves in the left part of the sunspot for @xmath71 above 90 .",
    "all in all these calculations confirm the alfvn nature of waves selected by the @xmath38 projection in our simulations , including returning the predicted result regarding the coupling between refracted fast waves and downward propagating alfvn waves in regions where the magnetic alignment is favourable .",
    "we proceed by calculating the acoustic and magnetic fluxes according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxes ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fluxes ] gives the time averages of the vertical magnetic and acoustic fluxes over the upper part of the simulation domain . in the case of the magnetic fluxes",
    "we only show them above the alfvn - acoustic equipartition layer where they are produced and where the separation between the modes according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : directions ] ) is meaningful .    above the equipartition layer ,",
    "the upward acoustic flux is mostly present in the right part of the sunspot for intermediate field inclinations ( upper panel ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with the energy calculations from fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] where the maximum of the transmitted acoustic energy is for inclinations about 30 . in the left part of the sunspot the acoustic flux is about zero or slightly negative .",
    "a large negative flux is also present at the central part around the axis at the very top of the simulation domain .",
    "thus , slow acoustic waves are reflected in the left part of the sunspot .",
    "this appears to be in agreement with the visual impression from fig .",
    "[ fig : vsnapshot ] ( upper panel ) where the interference pattern of the slow acoustic modes is observed to the left of the axis .",
    "we believe that this partial reflection is due to steep temperature increase around the axis in the upper chromospheric part of the simulation domain .",
    "we have performed additional simulations placing the upper boundary of the domain at lower heights , below the chromospheric temperature increase . in this case",
    "we did not observe downgoing slow acoustic waves .",
    "this confirms that the reflection is a physical effect and not a numerical artefact from the upper boundary condition of the simulations .    the magnetic flux above the alfvn - acoustic equipartition layer ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] ) is mostly positive .",
    "note that the absolute value of the magnetic flux is at all locations lower than the acoustic flux .",
    "the exception is the peripheral regions of the sunspot model where relatively large magnetic flux is obtained .",
    "however , this artificially large flux is due to insufficient height of the simulation box above the equipartition layer making it impossible to complete the reflection for the fast magnetic modes .",
    "the magnetic flux in the middle panel of fig .  [ fig : fluxes ] is due to a mixture of the fast and alfvn modes . to separate the flux of the alfvn mode we calculated the magnetic flux from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxes ] ) using the projections @xmath72 and @xmath69 .",
    "the result is given in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] . in agreement with previous considerations",
    "we observe that there is no significant flux in the peripheral part of the sunspot , confirming its origin due to incomplete reflection of the fast magnetic mode . as was already clear from the calculation of the phase relations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ) the alfvn flux in the right part of the sunspot ( @xmath71 between 0 and 90 ) is positive and the flux in the left part of the sunspot ( @xmath71 between 90  and 180 ) is negative , indicating downward propagating alfvn waves .",
    "these downward propagating waves are generated due to the coupling between the downgoing fast magnetic mode ( after its reflection ) and the alfvn mode .",
    "the alfvn flux only represents a minor fraction of the acoustic flux in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] .",
    "however , as explained at the end of section [ sec : vel ] , we believe this to be an artefact of the truncation of the broad alfvn conversion region . to overcome this limitation",
    ", we performed an experiment with five times larger frequency ( @xmath73 mhz ) and horizontal wavenumber ( @xmath74 mm@xmath29 ) allowing us to significantly compact the conversion region .",
    "this high frequency experiment is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hifreq ] , where indeed the upward alfvnic flux in the right half of the region now greatly exceeds the acoustic flux , and there is significant but very compact downward alfvn flux in the left half .",
    "thus , the conclusion is that alfvn flux can actually exceed acoustic flux . besides , alfvn waves are more able to propagate to great heights than are acoustic or fast waves , which are limited respectively by shock formation and by reflection .",
    "this suggests that they do indeed represent a significant product of wave propagation and conversion in sunspots .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the efficiency of conversion from fast to alfvn waves by means of 2.5d numerical simulations in a complex sunspot - like magnetic field configuration .",
    "it is important to realize that quantitatively simulating mode transformation numerically is a challenge , as any numerical inaccuracies are amplified in such second - order quantities as wave energy fluxes .",
    "the tests presented in this paper prove the robustness of our numerical procedure and offer an effective way to separate the alfvn from magneto - acoustic modes in numerical simulations .",
    "in general , the conclusions from the previous models in simplified uniform magnetic field configurations @xcite apply also to our more complex sunspot - like magnetic field configuration , though there are some apparent differences .",
    "we note three points in particular .",
    "secondly , the amount of magnetic energy due to alfvn waves transmitted to the upper atmosphere is about 10 times lower than for the acoustic waves .",
    "this differs from the conclusions reached by @xcite who find that at some particular inclinations and azimuth angles the magnetic flux is larger .",
    "this discrepancy is entirely to be expected , and is an artefact of the limitations of our present simulations .",
    "as seen in figure 10b of @xcite , the fast - to - alfvn conversion region for frequencies comparable to our 5 mhz is spread more or less uniformly over some 20 scale heights from @xmath2 upwards .",
    "clearly , we do not have the luxury of such abundant space in our simulation box , and so only a small fraction of the total potential alfvn flux is produced . in theory",
    ", this could be remedied in any of several ways :    1 .",
    "the box could be made substantially taller .",
    "however , this would involve encompassing yet larger alfvn speeds , especially if a transition region is included , with unfortunate consequences for our numerical time - step and therefore for the practical feasibility of the calculation .",
    "2 .   the magnetic field could be increased in magnitude .",
    "this is an attractive course of action in any case , as the 900 g at @xmath14 adopted here on the axis is very conservative , being a factor of 3 less than might be expected in a mature large sunspot .",
    "this would lower both the @xmath40 equipartition surface and the @xmath75 fast reflection level opening up more space above for mode conversion .",
    "of course , the maximum alfvn speed would again increase , with implications for the numerical time step .",
    "higher horizontal wavenumber waves could be modelled , increased by say a factor of 5 . as seen in @xcite , figure 10b ,",
    "conversion of waves with @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is the density scale height ) occurs in a considerably more compact region near @xmath2 . if frequency is increased by the same factor , then @xmath78 and therefore @xmath2 is unchanged , and the alfvn conversion region should fit within our computational box",
    "of course , little power is expected at such high frequencies in the sun , but nevertheless it is a useful experiment to prove the point .",
    "results of simulations on a similar model but with @xmath74 @xmath79 and a frequency of 25 mhz are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hifreq ] , and are in accord with expectations , yielding far higher alfvn fluxes .    finally , where the reflecting fast waves meet similarly inclined magnetic field in the conversion region as they propagate upward , they preferentially transfer their energy to upgoing alfvn waves . however , if their upward path crosses field lines at large angles there is little transfer .",
    "but then this correspondence may be achieved on their way back down , in which case downward propagating alfvn waves are the beneficiaries of their largess .",
    "this more efficient coupling to downward waves happens for azimuth angles above 90 , and was predicted by @xcite based on their cold plasma ( @xmath80 ) analysis .    in our future studies",
    "we will extend this analysis to fully 3d simulations and include both magnetic field twist and a chromosphere - corona transition region .",
    "of course twist contributes to the field orientation in the conversion regions , and therefore to the strength of mode conversion , both fast - to - slow and fast - to - alfvn , but we do not anticipate significant novel effects beyond this . on the other hand , a transition region ( tr )",
    "is expected to be highly reflective to alfvn waves , and therefore to greatly reduce coronal alfvn fluxes from chromospheric mode conversion .",
    "results in a zero-@xmath1 model @xcite confirm this , though they indicate that substantial coronal alfvn fluxes are still possible if the fast wave reflection point is within a few chromospheric scale heights of the tr , or indeed if the fast wave fails to reflect before it reaches the tr .",
    "it will be interesting to test this in realistic sunspot models .",
    "ultimately , our simulations will inform and be judged against observations of mhd waves in solar magnetic structures .",
    "the coronal observations of @xcite and @xcite are useful indicators of power reaching that height , though they are at the limits of our technology and subject to line - of - sight integration ambiguities .",
    "wave observations at photospheric and chromospheric levels may be more reliable and precise .",
    "in particular , correlations between velocity and magnetic perturbation phases are crucial in disentangling the various mhd modes in the low atmosphere @xcite , though this is a very difficult task even in full 3d simulations .",
    "significant progress has recently been made in the identification of wave modes observed in sunspots and other solar magnetic features .",
    "on the one hand , simultaneous photospheric and chromospheric spectropolarimetric observations ( such as those done with the tip instrument on tenerife , canary islands ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) introduce the possibility of `` following '' wave propagation with height @xcite and obtaining phase shifts between oscillations of magnetic field and velocity @xcite . on the other hand , bidimensional spectrometers ( as e.g. ibis instrument ;",
    "* or dot telescope on la palma , canary islands ) allow us to obtain high - resolution 2-dimensional velocity fields at different heights .",
    "such simultaneous observations are crucial for our understanding of the physics of wave propagation in active regions . in sunspot umbrae , where the magnetic field is predominantly vertical , slow field - aligned magneto - acoustic waves are firmly detected and even reproduced in simulations including their particular observed wave pattern @xcite . in regions with an inclined magnetic field ( sunspot penumbra and network canopies ) , a mixture of upward and downward propagating waves is often discovered @xcite . at photospheric level , these up- and downgoing waves are , possibly , fast magneto - acoustic waves undergoing a reflection process .",
    "in fact , from measured phase shifts between velocity and magnetic field oscillations , @xcite found that the contribution of slow mode waves is larger in umbral regions and the contribution of fast mode waves becomes progressively more important toward the umbra - penumbra boundary .",
    "alfvn waves are usually detected higher up in the corona @xcite .",
    "the simulations presented here suggest that the complete decoupling between the fast and alfvn waves happens in the upper chromosphere , or even above .",
    "since the upcoming acoustic waves on the sun are uncorrelated , their attack angle with respect to the sunspot magnetic field can be arbitrary , so a mixture of up- and downgoing alfvn waves will be produced , mostly above regions with inclined magnetic field .",
    "time variations of the chromospheric magnetic fields , together with velocity oscillations , are strongly desirable for the firm detection of alfvn waves . however ,",
    "measuring magnetic fields in the chromosphere may be challenging ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and actual measurements are scarce . as of today ,",
    "very few measurements exist in active and quiet chromospheric regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but , as far as we are aware , no time variations have been reported .",
    "further instrumental efforts , developments of chromospheric diagnostic techniques , as well as improved modelling , will be needed to constrain the results of the presented study .    financial support by the spanish ministry of science through projects aya2010 - 18029 and aya2011 - 24808 is gratefully acknowledged .",
