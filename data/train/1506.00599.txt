    "an interesting phenomenon that corresponds to spontaneous emissions ( as if a black body radiation ) from a black hole ( bh ) is the hr .",
    "it is a semi - classical outcome of the quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "hr dramatically changed our way of looking to the bhs ; they are not absolutely black and cold objects , rather they emit energy with a characteristic temperature : ht .",
    "event horizon , where is an irreversible point ( in classical manner ) for any object including photons is the test - bed of the gedanken experiment for the hr .",
    "the studies concerning this phenomenon have been carrying on by using different methods . in particular , the quantum tunneling @xcite of particles with different spins from the various bhs have gained momentum in the recent years ( the reader may be referred to @xcite and references cited therein ) . recently , it has been shown that hr of the bosons with spin-0 ( scalar particles ) and spin-1 ( vector particles ) from the tlwh @xcite , which is a bridge or tunnel between different regions of the spacetime is possible by using the pothg @xcite .",
    "wormhole has been extensively studied in different areas @xcite .",
    "however , ht of the tlwh appears to be negative because of the phantom energy ( exotic matter : the sum of the pressure and energy density is negative ) that supports the broadness of the wormhole throat @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is a well - known fact that the virtual particle - antiparticle pairs are created near the horizon . in a bh spacetime the real particles with positive energy and temperature",
    "are emitted towards spatial infinity @xcite .",
    "however , in the pothg which is analog to the white hole geometry , the antiparticles come out from the horizon @xcite .",
    "in other words , our analysis predicts that the energy spectrum of the antiparticles leads to a negative temperature for the tlwh . for the subject of the white hole radiation , the reader may refer to @xcite .",
    "as it is shown by caldwell et al @xcite , the dark matter ( dm ) @xcite could have a phantom energy . in this regard",
    ", the phantom energy can keep apart every bound object until the cosmos eventuates in the big - rip @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "dm does not emit , reflect or absorb light , making it not just dark but entirely transparent .",
    "but if the dm particles strolling around a bh or  a wormhole can produce gamma - rays would give a possibility to study the radiation of this mysterious matter @xcite .",
    "dm has many candidates , and gravitino ( spin-@xmath0 ) is one of them @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray decay of the gravitino dm has been very recently studied in @xcite .",
    "so , hr of the gravitinos from the bhs and/or wormholes could make an impact on the production of the dm .",
    "behaviors of the gravitino s wave function are governed by the rses @xcite .",
    "so , our main motivation in this paper is to investigate the hr of the gravitino tunneling from the tlwh geometry . using the rses and hj method",
    ", we aim to regain the standard ht  of the tlwh .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the 3 + 1 dimensional tlwh @xcite and analyzes the rses for the gravitino particles in the pothg of the tlwh @xcite .",
    "we show that the rses are separable when a suitable hj nsatz is employed .",
    "then the radial equation can be reduced to a coefficient matrix equation that makes us possible to compute the probabilities of the emission / absorption of the gravitinos .",
    "finally , we calculate the tunneling rate of the radiated gravitinos , and retrieve the standard ht of the tlwh .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in sec .",
    "for the wave equation of the gravitino ( spin-3/2 ) particles , we start with the massless ( the mass has no remarkable effect in the computation of the quantum tunneling @xcite ) rses @xcite : @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a vector - valued spinor and the @xmath3 matrices satisfy @xmath4 .",
    "the first equation is the dirac equation applied to every vector index of @xmath5 , while the second is a set of additional constraints to ensure that no ghost state propagates ; that is , to ensure that @xmath5 represents only spin-@xmath0 fermions , with no spin-@xmath6 mixed states @xcite .",
    "the covariant derivative obeys @xmath7    where @xmath8 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\{\\gamma^{\\alpha},\\gamma^{\\beta}\\ }   &   = 2g^{\\alpha\\beta}\\times i. \\label{4}\\ ] ]    the metric of tlwh in the generalized retarded eddington - finkelstein coordinates ( refcs ) , which is the pothg , is given by @xcite @xmath9    where @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "misner - sharp energy is represented by @xmath12  which becomes @xmath13 on the trapping horizon ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "marginal surfaces having @xmath15 are the past marginal surfaces in the refcs @xcite .    for solving the rses ,",
    "we use the following dirac @xmath16-matrices:@xmath17{cc}-i & -\\sigma^{3}\\\\ -\\sigma^{3 } & i \\end{array } \\right )   , \\,\\,\\ \\gamma^{r}=\\sqrt{f}\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}0 & \\sigma^{3}\\\\ \\sigma^{3 } & 0 \\end{array } \\right )   , \\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma^{\\theta }   &   = \\frac{1}{r}\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}0 & \\sigma^{1}\\\\ \\sigma^{1 } & 0 \\end{array } \\right )   , \\,\\,\\,\\ \\gamma^{\\phi}=\\frac{1}{r\\text{sin}\\theta}\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}0 & \\sigma^{2}\\\\ \\sigma^{2 } & 0 \\end{array } \\right )   , \\label{6}\\ ] ]    where the pauli matrices are given by @xmath18{cc}0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{array } \\right )   , \\sigma^{2}=\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}0 & -i\\\\ i & 0 \\end{array } \\right )   , \\sigma^{3}=\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{array } \\right )   . \\label{7}\\ ] ]    gravitino wave function ( @xmath19 ) has two spin states [ spin up ( i.e. positive @xmath20direction ) and spin down ( i.e. negative @xmath20direction ) ] : @xmath21 @xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes the gravitino action which is going to be expanded in powers of @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the arbitrary constants .",
    "here we shall only consider the spin up case , since the spin down case is fully analogous with it .",
    "the action for the spin - up states can be chosen as follows @xmath26    therefore , the corresponding rses become @xmath27   + \\sqrt{f}(-c_{0}\\partial_{r}s_{\\uparrow0 } )   & = 0,\\label{11}\\\\ \\frac{1}{r\\text{sin}\\theta}(-ic_{0}\\partial_{\\phi}s_{\\uparrow0})+\\frac{1}{r}(-c_{0}\\partial_{\\theta}s_{\\uparrow0 } )   &   = 0,\\label{12}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f}}\\left [   \\left (   -a_{0}-ic_{0}\\right )   ( \\partial _ { u}s_{\\uparrow0})\\right ]   + \\sqrt{f}(-a_{0}\\partial_{r}s_{\\uparrow0 } )   & = 0,\\label{13}\\\\ \\frac{1}{r\\text{sin}\\theta}(-ia_{0}\\partial_{\\phi}s_{\\uparrow0})+\\frac{1}{r}(-a_{0}\\partial_{\\theta}s_{\\uparrow0 } )   &   = 0 , \\label{14}\\ ] ]    with the constraints equations : @xmath28    equations ( 15 - 18 ) are not important here . because these equations give an independent wave solution , so that they have no effect on the action @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the separation of variables method is applied to the action @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are energy and angular constants , respectively .",
    "however , @xmath33 is an arbitrary complex constant .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( 11 - 14 ) reduce to @xmath34    equations ( 21 ) and ( 23 ) are about the solutions of @xmath32 , and they do not have contribution to the tunneling rate .",
    "for this reason , we simply ignore them .",
    "namely , the master equations for the tunneling rate are eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 22 ) . to analyze them , we first consider the case of @xmath35 @xcite . using eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 22 ) , we now have a solution for @xmath36 as @xmath37    the integrand has a simple pole at @xmath38 .",
    "choosing the contour as a half loop going around this pole from left to right and integrating , one obtains @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the surface gravity at the horizon . on the other hand , if one sets @xmath41 , this time eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 22 ) admit the following solution for @xmath42 @xmath43    hence , we can derive the ingoing / outgoing imaginary action solutions as @xmath44 @xmath45    we can now set @xmath46 for the action of absorbed ( ingoing ) gravitinos .",
    "we can tune their probability : @xmath47    to % 100 by letting @xmath48    consequently , the probability of the emitted ( outgoing ) gravitinos becomes @xmath49    recalling the definition of the tunneling rate : @xmath50    which is also equivalent to the boltzmann factor : @xmath51 , we read the ht of the tlwh as follows @xmath52 which is a negative temperature .",
    "this result implies that if the trapping horizon remains in the past outer region , the wormhole throat would have a negative temperature @xcite",
    ". the phantom energy , which is the special case of the exotic matter could be the reason of that negative temperature @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath53 in the action ( 19 ) , it is possible to obtain the positive temperature : @xmath54 .",
    "although , the latter remark contradicts with the previous results @xcite ( and whence , one may easily get rid of the case of @xmath53 ) , however hong and kim @xcite showed that possibility of negative / positive temperature of the wormhole depends on the exotic matter distribution .",
    "in this work , we have studied the hr of the gravitino particles from the tlwh in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "tlwh has been introduced in the pothg .",
    "we have analyzed the rses in the background of the tlwh with the help of hj method .",
    "the probabilities of the emitted / absorbed gravitino particles from the trapped horizon of the tlwh have been computed . after comparing",
    "the obtained tunneling rate with the boltzmann factor , we have recovered the standard ht of the tlwh , which is a negative temperature .",
    "this is the special condition in which the high - energy states are more occupied than lower - energy states @xcite .",
    "another possibility of the negative temperature may originate from the exotic matter distribution of the wormhole @xcite . meanwhile , very recently it has been claimed by @xcite that hr does not occur in the pothg .",
    "in fact , the latter debatable remark is based on the study of @xcite stating that cosmic matter flux may turn the hr off . on the other hand ,",
    "hayward show that switching off the radiation causes the wormhole to collapse to a schwarzschild bh @xcite .    in summary",
    ", gravitinos can tunnel through wormhole [ simply this can be thought as a wormhole with one entrance ( bh ) and one exit ( white hole ) ] .",
    "in such a case , gravitinos tunnel from the bh with positive temperature , while they tunnel through the white hole with negative temperature .",
    "thus our calculations are based on the exit of the wormhole , just as the white hole case . besides",
    ", we have shown that positive temperature can be obtained by tuning the @xmath33-constant in the action ( 19 ) to zero .",
    "however , the latter result is a debatable issue , and it demands much deeper analysis",
    ". this will be our next venture in this line of study ."
