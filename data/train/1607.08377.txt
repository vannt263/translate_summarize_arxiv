    "understanding the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water is of great importance due to its ubiquity in biological and chemical processes .",
    "nevertheless , giving a comprehensive picture of water and aqueous solutions at the molecular level still represents a noticeable challenge .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations based on empirical force fields have long been the technique of choice for investigating the microscopical properties of aqueous solutions.@xcite however , force field methods rely on experimental data and the results depend on how the force field is parametrized .",
    "furthermore , the parametrization varies from one system to another leading to a transferability problem .",
    "these limitations are overcome by simulation schemes based on first - principles density functionals , in which the energy and the atomic forces are evaluated directly from the evolving electronic structure .    with the increasing availability of computer resources and the improvement of computational algorithms",
    ", first - principles techniques have been extensively applied to study the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water.@xcite it has become clear that density functionals in which the exchange - correlation energy is treated within a generalized gradient approximation lead to overstructured systems and to underestimated diffusion coefficients . when the description of the electronic structure is improved through the use of hybrid density functionals , these shortcomings persist.@xcite similarly ,",
    "the explicit consideration of the quantum motion of the nuclei is not sufficient to lead to a significant amelioration of the structural properties.@xcite at variance , recent studies have pointed to the critical importance of accounting for van der waals interactions in the description of liquid water.@xcite    sophisticated methods such as coupled clusters or mller - plesset perturbation theory accurately account for van der waals interactions and have recently been applied to liquid water.@xcite however , these methods are still computationally too demanding for a widespread use in routine simulations . more recently , several strategies for including van der waals interactions within density functional simulation schemes have been proposed leading to an improved description of the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water.@xcite in particular , schmidt _ et al .",
    "_ performed molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water in the isobaric - isothermal ensemble ( @xmath2).@xcite in @xmath2 simulations , the supercell parameters are free to adjust during the evolution allowing the system to reach its equilibrium density at a fixed pressure without imposing additional constraints .",
    "these simulations@xcite revealed that the equilibrium density yielded by semilocal density functionals underestimates the experimental value by about 15%  and that the experimental density is recovered through the use of empirical dispersion corrections.@xcite these results are in perfect agreement with the molecular dynamics simulations performed by wang _",
    "et al._,@xcite who compared semilocal and van der waals corrected density functionals using a @xmath3 protocol .    recently , several nonlocal formulations have been introduced which explicitly account for van der waals interactions through a functional of the density.@xcite among these , the one proposed by vydrov and van voorhis@xcite in its revised form denoted rvv10 carries the advantage of being particularly suited to be used in conjunction with plane - wave basis sets , leading to a scheme which does not yield any significant overhead with respect to standard semilocal functionals.@xcite while rvv10 still relies on a phenomenological formulation , it carries an important advantage with respect to empirical schemes . indeed , once the parameters are set , the resulting functional can be carried over to any weakly bonded system without requiring any further parameter tuning .",
    "it could thus be envisaged to use the same theoretical scheme for studying various aqueous solutions .    in this work ,",
    "we present results obtained through first - principles molecular dynamics simulations in the @xmath1 ensemble of liquid water at near ambient conditions .",
    "the van der waals interactions are explicitly taken into account through the functional rvv10.@xcite first , we test the performance of the rvv10 functional on the water dimer and on the i@xmath0 phase of ice , finding only small variations of the hydrogen bond strength in those systems compared to semilocal functionals . in our molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water",
    ", we then find that rvv10 provides a noticeably improved description compared to standard semilocal functionals .",
    "not only the equilibrium density is recovered but also the structural and dynamical properties are much closer to experimental observations . in particular , we focus on the local order and on an analysis of the hydrogen bond network . hence , rvv10 allows for a good description of liquid water at a computational cost equivalent to semilocal density functionals and appears particularly attractive for the treatment of water - solute interactions .",

    "the computational scheme adopted throughout this work is based on the self - consistent kohn - sham approach to density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in the quantum - espresso suite of programs.@xcite the valence kohn - sham orbitals are expanded up to a kinetic - energy cutoff of 85 ry , while core - valence interactions are described by norm - conserving pseudopotentials.@xcite the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy is described within the generalized - gradient approximation proposed by perdew , becke , and ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite in addition to the semilocal pbe functional , we performed calculations in which van der waals interactions are explicitly taken into account .",
    "to this aim , among the several van der waals density functional schemes proposed , we adopted rvv10 functional , recently introduced by sabatini _",
    "et al._@xcite as an essentially equivalent variant of the nonlocal vv10 functional developed by vydrov and van voorhis.@xcite the vv10 functional has been shown to be particularly successful in reproducing the physical properties of molecules and weakly bonded solids.@xcite the advantage of adopting the revised functional rvv10 rests in a more efficient evaluation of the correlation energy and its derivatives within a plane - waves framework , a major prerequisite when long _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations have to be carried out .",
    "the rvv10 functional is defined by a very simple analytic form and depends on an empirically determined parameter , @xmath4 , which controls the short - range behavior of the functional.@xcite this parameter can be optimized in order to reproduce the correct physical properties of a chosen set of materials . in particular ,",
    "the rvv10 functional , as implemented in the quantum - espresso package , has been tested over the s22 set of molecules .",
    "the best description of the binding energies is obtained for @xmath5.@xcite although accurate in describing the binding energy and geometry of molecules,@xcite the vv10 functional gives overestimated binding energies for weakly bonded solids.@xcite to achieve an improved description of a set of layered solids , bjrkman has proposed a higher value for the parameter @xmath4 ( up to 10.25).@xcite to identify the optimal functional for treating aqueous systems , we therefore consider in the following various values of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we perform first - principles born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations of 64 water molecules in the isobaric - isoenthalpic statistical ensemble ( @xmath1 ) at near - ambient conditions .",
    "the quantum motion of the nuclei is neglected in the present work .",
    "we use the beeman algorithm to integrate newton s equations of motion , as implemented in the quantum - espresso package , with an integration time step of 0.48 fs .",
    "simulations are carried out using the pbe and rvv10 functionals . in the latter , the parameter @xmath4 is set to 6.3 , 8.9 , 9.3 , and 9.5 , respectively . in the following , we use the notation rvv10-b6.3 to indicate the rvv10 functional with the parameter @xmath4 set to 6.3 , and similarly for the other values of @xmath4 .",
    "the molecular dynamics runs last between 25 and 35 ps .",
    "the cell size is allowed to fluctuate with the constraint of conserving the initial cubic symmetry .",
    "a vanishing external pressure is imposed through the use of the parrinello - rahman barostat.@xcite    the starting configuration for each simulation is chosen from a trajectory obtained through a @xmath3 classical molecular - dynamics simulation in which the density of the system is fixed at 1 g/@xmath6 and the temperature at 300 k. for each functional , a preliminary @xmath2 equilibration run of about 5  ps is carried out before collecting statistics . the temperature is set to 350 k to ensure a liquid - like behavior @xcite during the equilibration runs the temperature is controlled by a velocity rescaling thermostat , which only acts when the cumulative average temperature moves out of the window 350@xmath720 k. however , we observe that the temperature drift during the equilibration time is minimal and that the thermostat remains inactive after an initial period of a few picoseconds .",
    "in particular , we obtained average temperatures of 349 , 344 , and 342 k for our molecular dynamics simulations based on pbe , rvv10-b6.3 , rvv10-b9.3 , respectively .",
    "in the @xmath2 molecular dynamics simulations with a basis set involving a constant number of plane waves , fluctuations of the volume imply fluctuations of the effective energy cutoff defining the basis set.@xcite this condition requires extra precautions .",
    "all the simulations are started from a geometry with a cell of fixed density at 1 g/@xmath6 and the corresponding cut - off energy is chosen in such a way that the stress tensor is converged within 1 kbar .",
    "those simulations , which show a decrease of density during the equilibration run , are restarted with a larger initial volume to restore the originally set higher cut - off .",
    "once the cumulative average value of the density reaches a constant value , we ensure that the density fluctuations do not lead to any integration problem .    during all the production runs , we observe that the temperature remains constant and that the conditions to activate the thermostat are not met . in these conditions",
    "our simulations are effectively sampling the isobaric - isoenthalpic ( @xmath1 ) ensemble .",
    "since the external pressure is forced to be zero the total energy of the system , @xmath8 , is conserved on average and can be used to check the quality of our integration scheme .",
    "the simplest system that water molecules can form is the water dimer . despite its simplicity",
    ", the water dimer has extensively been investigated in physical chemistry.@xcite it plays a major role in many important physical and chemical processes .",
    "in addition , a better understanding of the isolated water dimer implies a better understanding of the hydrogen bond which is at the origin of the very peculiar properties of water in its condensed phases.@xcite finally , in simulation studies , the water dimer is often used as the simplest water system to test new computational approaches.@xcite        in fig .

    "we use the rvv10-b9.3 functional and a simulation cell at a density of 1 g/@xmath6 , which closely corresponds to the equilibrium density of liquid water for this functional .",
    "the average temperature in the simulation does not show any drift and averages to the value of 350 k. we collect data on an equilibrated simulation run of 25 ps .",
    "the mean square displacement vs.  time is determined as an average over all molecules and over trajectories with initial times separated by 100 fs . by virtue of einstein s relation ,",

    "300 & & @xmath24    [ tab : msd ]    the comparison of the calculated diffusion coefficient with experiment requires some care . since the diffusion coefficient shows a strong dependence on temperature,@xcite it is necessary to compare theoretical and experimental results achieved at the same temperature @xmath15 .",
    "based on experimental data in ref .  , we obtain an extrapolated experimental value of @xmath25 @xmath14/s at 350 k , corresponding to the temperature in our simulation .    the comparison between theory and experiment is further affected by finite - size effects . to estimate these effects",
    ", we assume that the diffusion coefficient in the periodic cell underestimates the value corresponding to the infinite - size limit by : @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath28 a constant , @xmath29 the viscosity , and @xmath30 the side of the periodic cell . to take these finite - size effects into account we compare the calculated diffusion coefficient @xmath16 with a reference value @xmath17 , which represent the experimental value for the temperature and cell size used in the simulation . for this purpose ,",
    "we take for @xmath29 the experimental value of the viscosity at 350 k ( @xmath31 pa@xmath32s ) as extrapolated from the data in ref .  , and for @xmath30 the cubic cell side corresponding to 64 molecules at the experimental density ( @xmath33  ) . for the conditions in our simulation ,",
    "we thus obtain @xmath34 @xmath14/s and @xmath35 @xmath14/s . in table",
    "[ tab : msd ] , the diffusion coefficient @xmath16 obtained from the molecular dynamics trajectory is directly compared with this reference value @xmath17 .",
    "the comparison in table [ tab : msd ] indicates that the diffusion coefficient obtained with the rvv10-b9.3 functional at 350 k ( @xmath36 @xmath14/s ) underestimates the reference value at the same temperature by a factor of about three .",
    "this discrepancy should be attributed to the cumulative effect resulting from the residual shortcomings of the adopted functional and the neglect of the quantum motion of the nuclei .",
    "however , the agreement is much better in case the calculated diffusion coefficient at 350 k is compared with a reference value derived from the experimental diffusion coefficient at 300 k ( @xmath37 @xmath14/s ) .",
    "it is also instructive to compare the diffusion coefficients obtained with the rvv10-b9.3 functional with a previous pbe simulation at the same density and temperature.@xcite the present simulation enhances the diffusion coefficient approximately by a factor of three , yielding an improved agreement with experiment .",
    "indeed , the diffusion coefficient @xmath16 obtained in the present rvv10-b9.3 simulation corresponds to 35%  of the value of @xmath17 , whereas the @xmath16 in the pbe simulation only reaches 12%of the respective reference value .",
    "hence , the use of the present nonlocal van der waals functional leads to an improved description of the water molecule mobility with respect to that achieved with the semilocal pbe functional .",
    "we investigated the effect of explicitly including van der waals interactions in _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water . among the several available density functionals for treating van der waals interactions",
    ", we adopted the rvv10 functional , which corresponds to a revised form@xcite of the formulation proposed by vydrov and van voorhis.@xcite this choice was motivated by the fact that the rvv10 functional allows for an evaluation of the total energy and the atomic forces at the same computational cost of standard semilocal functionals .",
    "furthermore , once the phenomenological parameters in the rvv10 functional are set , the same theoretical scheme can be carried over to study aqueous solutions .",
    "we first checked the accuracy of the nonlocal rvv10 functional in describing the water dimer and ice i@xmath0 , finding energetic and structural properties in good agreement with both experimental and previous theoretical results .",
    "for these systems , the hydrogen - bond energy obtained with the rvv10 functional is in good agreement with both the experimental and the pbe result .",
    "we then performed molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water in the @xmath1 statistical ensemble .",
    "in particular , we compared results obtained through simulations using pbe and rvv10 functionals . with the semilocal pbe functional",
    ", we obtained an equilibrium density of 0.87 g/@xmath6 , significantly lower than the experimental density of 1 g/@xmath6 , but in very good agreement with previous @xmath2 simulations based on the same functional.@xcite at variance , the rvv10 functional , in which the parameter @xmath4 is set to its original value ( 6.3 , ref .  ) , yields a density of 1.1 g/@xmath6 .",
    "we found that the equilibrium density could be varied by modifying the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath38 , we obtained an equilibrium density of 0.99 g/@xmath6 , very close to the experimental value .",
    "interestingly , we noticed that the use of rvv10-b9.3 also improved the local structure and the mobility of the water molecules .",
    "indeed , the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function in rvv10-b9.3 is in much better agreement with experiment than pbe .",
    "furthermore , the average number of hydrogen bonds per molecule achieved with the rvv10-b9.3 functional ( 3.59 ) shows a closer agreement with the estimate derived from experimental data ( 3.58 ) , than the corresponding numbers obtained with pbe ( 3.73 ) or rvv10-b6.3 ( 3.55 ) .    the higher density achieved for liquid water with the nonlocal van der waals",
    "functional indicates that the dispersion forces promote the role of non - directional interactions with respect to the semilocal functional in which the directionality of the hydrogen bonds dominates .",
    "the observed structural variations in liquid water thus arise from a different balance between non - directional and directional interactions .    in conclusion",
    ", our work demonstrates that the explicit treatment of van der waals interactions through the rvv10 formulation considerably improves both the structural and the dynamical properties of liquid water with respect to the perdew - burke - ernzerhof functional .",
    "this improvement is achieved without any significant computational overhead .",
    "hence , the present theoretical framework should generally be preferred over the use of the perdew - burke - ernzerhof functional in any application involving liquid water .",
